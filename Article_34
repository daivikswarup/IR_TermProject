The petition, which will be heard today, was filed before a bench of Justice BD Ahmed and Justice RK Gauba and it also sought a direction to the JNU to allow Delhi Police to enter its premises to arrest the five students- Umar Khalid, Anant Prakash Narayan, Ashutosh Kumar, Rama Naga and Anirban Bhattacharya.
"Direct respondent 4 (JNU) to permit respondent 3 (Delhi Police Commissioner) to enter premises of Respondent 4 and to arrest the respondents 5 to 10 (JNU students) and other accused person connected with the said case," the petition said.
The petition mentioned through senior advocate Adish C Aggarwala and advocate VK Anand also sought action against the faculty members of the University for allegedly trying to "obstruct the process of administration of criminal justice system and assisting for violation of law of lands."
Citing media reports, the petition said that on February 21 the five students wanted in the case resurfaced in JNU at around 8 PM, adding that on Monday the Vice Chancellor had refused to give permission to Delhi Police to enter the university campus to arrest the students.
