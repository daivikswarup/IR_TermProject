<p>BREAKING DAN HODGES NEWS: Man with Tory views writing for Tory newspaper quits Labour Party.</p>

<p>Which is the worst bit of depravity...Cameron dipping his todger into a dead pigs mouth, or Corbyn dipping his wick into the Fatabbottapotamus ?...Methinks the latter !!</p>

<p>Antiwar is a strange view of the world. As a disciple of Jesus Christ, I'm in good company then.</p>

<p>On which other-worldly planet can a man be castigated for being a peace lover ?<br/>Why!!! that would be planet Tory of course<br/>Do you people ever stop and listen to the utter bollox you spew?<br/>In a world where the Turks are being used as a catspaw to drag Russia into conflict with NATO - you idiots think that is OK? <br/>Have you any idea of the military muscle the Russians have?  - they could destroy this little teat of an island in the North Atlantic without even pausing for breath<br/>'As dumb as a bag of hammers' as the global prime movers would say</p>

<p>Women only carriages?<br/>Wouldn't we be better off with Kuffar-only carriages?</p>

<p>Mr.Corbyn is showing great political awareness in not being led into debating what makes Cameron feel clever.Cameron has no idea how to respond.You only have to look at the pictures of Cameron his face says it all.</p>

<p>Billy Bragg likes him.</p>

<p>Spot on article Dan !</p>

<p>Peace does not keep itself - Peace must be enforced. We can't stop the war until Peace is enforced! A history lesson: This war started in the 1910's when Britain and France had a brain-fart and embarked on drawing artificial borders in the middle east. And 'hark' the words of Saddam Hussein who stated very clearly when Iraq was attacked in the Gulf War. - "The mother of all battles has begun!" So true were his words!</p>

<p>Total b*ll*x. Sadam Hussein was speaking of his entrenched troops in the desert which managed to keep out the invading Americans for approximately 30 seconds.</p>

<p>"This war started in the 1910's when Britain and France had a brain-fart and embarked on drawing artificial borders in the middle east."</p>

<p>all liberal's fault.</p>

<p>I blame fatcha !!</p>

<p>Of course it is all about stop *which* war - and for what reasons - which are based on where you are standing in the world and your political beliefs.  That's why we have wars and why those on side A will always direct *stop-the-war* stuff at side B - quite often because they are tacitly funded to do so.</p>

<p>lets see. terrorism killed around 30k last year. Cancer kills about 8 million a year world wide, car accidents kills about a million. malaria kills half a million, tb kills about a million.</p>

<p>yep, i agree, i worry about terrorism every minute of my waking day and sleeping nights. i want to use all my tax pounds on bombing dasterdly terrorists. when i get cancer i will beam in happiness that it wasn't a terrorist that got me.</p>

<p>go go go</p>

<p>I truly hope no one you know or love is ever caught up in a terrorist atrocity.</p>

<p>You might realise that making jokes about it is in extremely poor taste. </p>

<p>You are clearly too dim or cognitively dissonant to see his point.</p>

<p>Thanks for that detailed and well thought out response. Bravo.</p>

<p>"You might realise that making jokes about it is in extremely poor taste."</p>

<p>statistical analysis is a joke in britain i live my life like a child in constant fear of things that are unlikely to hurt me</p>

<p>when life is like a scary movie that stops me from acting out too much</p>

<p>uncle dad in london is looking after me</p>

<p>Now that meeting would have been the perfect time to practice our precision bombing techniques. </p>

<p>Dan,  I'm guessing that you must at least  'skim read'  the comments section on your articles  ...  if only to access the click-bait value.</p>

<p>So what do you make of the level of  ...  well, let's be generous and say  'debate'  ...  amongst those readers who support your point of view  ?</p>

<p>Does it please you to know your  'work'  appeals to  ignorant,  racist,  thickos   ?</p>

<p>Is your bar really set that low  ?</p>

<p>I don't see that many lefties on here. Apart from the trolls.</p>

<p>There are no  'lefties'  in the gallery that Hodges plays to</p>

<p>QED</p>

<p>lol demonstrate a lack</p>

<p>blairites aren't lefties.</p>

<p>I for one am really glad that this hairy lipped Canute looks like one and talks like one.<br/>Long may he reign.<br/>Well done EdStone Milliband (Captain adenoid) You really ffoulked up your party.</p>

<p>Dan,</p>

<p>2 days ago, you called for Donald Trump to be banned in/from the UK, on account he is - in your words - a fascist guilty of hate speech. Of course, he's not such thing - he hasn't called for anyone to kill anyone else, or even hurt them, not that that stopped your strident calls to shut him down.</p>

<p>Today, Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party and wannabe Prime Minister walks into an organisation - which he used to be chairman of - who openly support terrorists who would cheerfully kill every British person on the planet, who would cheerfully gang-rape defenceless young girls, who would cheerfully persuade their supporters to blow themselves to bits - so long as they take out a bunch of "infidels" while they're at it - and THIS is all the criticism you come up with?</p>

<p>Corbyn is doing more than just sticking two fingers up at the British people, his own party, even the EU: He is actively doing his best to assist our downfall as a nation. In less politically correct times, he'd stand accused of being a traitor; and, in more enlightened times, he would be hanged for this crime.</p>

<p>Still, on the bright side, I absolutely <b>love</b> what he's doing to the Labour party. Long may his reign continue.</p>

<p>To be fair, Hodges has written his fair share of Corbyn articles. None of them are complimentary. </p>

<p>I'll have a pint of whatever you're on......</p>

<p>Seriously? You'd consider the ramblings of a rich white American with a scary hairpiece worse than the possibility of having a British Prime Minister who sympathises with ISIL?</p>

<p>I didn't realise that Hilary wore just a " hairpiece"....It looks like a full wig to me...</p>

<p>If only Trump would do the same. That weird ginger mop in the middle of his head is completely off-putting.</p>

<p>Well I do agree that Trumps hair is worse than JRs hat - of course, as I have intimated earlier. But most of your post above is questionable and full of opinion presented as fact, dontcha think mate?</p>

<p>I may have exaggerated somewhat for effect - but you can't deny that "Stop the War" has publicly supported terrorist organisations, and Corbyn was their chairman for several (four?) years.</p>

<p>I don't think they ever explicitly support terrorist organisations but they do see everything through the prism of anti imperialism and anti capitalism - every problem that ever happens anyway is always the West's fault. This is simplistic thinking in a complex world. That said, labelling him a traitor suggests you think we should all be unquestioningly supportive of the decisions of government when we're at war, which strikes me as a tad totalitarian.</p>

<p>Didn't some video evidence emerge just today (or maybe it was yesterday) of STW's leader publicly supporting Hezbollah and ISIS (or maybe ISIL, or IS, whatever they are this week)? Seems pretty conclusive to me.</p>

<p>I don't call him a traitor because he isn't "unquestioningly supportive of the decisions of government when we're at war" - I'm not convinced that bombing the sh*t out of Syria will achieve the desired objective, and it might even stir things up even worse than they are now: But that doesn't mean I think ISIL/ISIS/IS/FFS/DAESH should be negotiated with, given a voice at the table, etc., or be allowed to continue to spread their particularly nasty form of terrorism.... no, I think we should send in the SAS (or SBS) &amp; take them out clinically; start at the head &amp; work down.</p>

<p>They cant be negotiated with and to believe so is naive at best, moronic at worst. Didn't hear about that video. Do you have a link?</p>

<p>It was Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Here's the link.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12044948/Stop-the-War-Coalition-founder-declares-support-for-Hamas-and-Hizbollah.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>By the way, here's a link to an interesting article about how Jeremy's friends in Hamas educate their children.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2014/05/hamas-tv-teaches-children-to-kill-all-jews/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.new.spectator.co....</a></p>

<p>"It was Hamas and Hezbollah."</p>

<p>do you have any proof that they're more of a terrorist organisation in outcome or result than the british army other than a belief system?</p>

<p>Someone asked a question. I answered it.</p>

<p>But in answer to you, yes, because they are actually terrorists, not an army. </p>

<p>are you also saying that you need to formally be under the guidance of a state to run effectual campaigns to champion sovereignty?</p>

<p>or to resist at all is bad?</p>

<p>are you saying anything at all or just inferring things and hoping tacit and collective belief of those things to be true is enough to warrant saying them?</p>

<p>Are you implying that somehow IS, Hamas and Hezbollah have some form of legitimacy? That you support their causes and methods?</p>

<p>"Are you implying that somehow IS, Hamas and Hezbollah have some form of legitimacy? "</p>

<p>i'm not implying anything, i'm saying that if a south american country decided that UKIP were a danger to the world (no equivalent example is the problem here) and got it in their heads that they knew exactly what was driving them and that their intent was PURELY X and that there was no gripe that these things stem from then well yes you've conceded that you're not to actually analyse what this group of people are.</p>

<p>they are a group of people. people have universal needs.</p>

<p>"That you support their causes and methods?"</p>

<p>We haven't got anything in their heads about IS and Hamas. They are very open about what their aims are. </p>

<p>"We haven't got anything in their heads about IS and Hamas."</p>

<p>in english please?</p>

<p>That's rich.</p>

<p>"we haven't got anything in their heads about"</p>

<p>can you move to a country where this makes sense, thanks</p>

<p>Oh the irony.</p>

<p>"(assuming you're from here)"</p>

<p>I still have no idea where you're from - not that I care. </p>

<p>"I still have no idea where you're from - not that I care."</p>

<p>i'm pretty sure you just made a reply there</p>

<p>so you care</p>

<p>and you made the point about where i'm from</p>

<p>even though you don't know where i'm from</p>

<p>yet you're stating that it's irony for me to talk about your english</p>

<p>but you don't know where i'm from.</p>

<p>do you have a habit of just saying whatever and hoping that no one notices you're absolutely filled to the brim with rubbish?</p>

<p>Again with the irony. Please stop now, it's getting stale. </p>

<p>i'm sorry little one but it seems you don't know what irony means</p>

<p>the irony in you claiming that my post is ironic?</p>

<p>or the irony in you ignoring my point about the english language and instead making an ironic post to highlight your disbelief with yourself?</p>

<p>"But in answer to you, yes, because they are actually terrorists, not an army."</p>

<p>that is the titles we give things and not what i asked</p>

<p>i asked about outcome (stats)</p>

<p>not the names we give things</p>

<p>names are an emotive argument</p>

<p>stating that we people we call terrorists are the people we call terrorists doesn't measure levels of terror objectively, moreover the british army wouldn't be a terror to a brit but to others it's another matter.</p>

<p>If you're trying to suggest there is an equivalence between the British army and IS and Hamas?</p>

<p>Do you suppose that is a mainstream view in this country and that a political party espousing such a view would be in any way electable?</p>

<p>"equivalence between the British army and IS and Hamas?"</p>

<p>guns bring death and when you don't know the person behind the gun personally why would you differentiate?</p>

<p>i know brits do because they've been trained to but they're not really often met facing that end of the barrel</p>

<p>"and that a political party espousing such a view would be in any way electable?"</p>

<p>what view? we don't have invaders on the scale they cope with in order to take a party on that platform seriously. if we had the same concerns as that region then we'd consider "them".</p>

<p>So yes, you do equate the British army to Islamist terrorists.</p>

<p>People like you are what is wrong with this country (assuming you're from here). </p>

<p>"So yes, you do equate the British army to Islamist terrorists."</p>

<p>only if you entirely mangle the word equate to a meaningless point.</p>

<p>"People like you are what is wrong with this country (assuming you're from here)."</p>

<p>beautiful.</p>

<p>I have no idea where you're from. Lots of people post from abroad. </p>

<p>"I have no idea where you're from. Lots of people post from abroad."</p>

<p>the majority in fact</p>

<p>most people aren't from the UK</p>

<p>it's CRAZY</p>

<p>Corbyn is a serious risk to national security. As a member of the Privy Council he has access to national secret operations. Don`t trust the snaky little swine !!!</p>

<p>JR I think that we must be fair to JC. Although completely lacking in judgment and an obvious dullard, he showed tremendous bravery in having carnal knowledge, unassisted by drugs or hallucinogenics, of Diane (pass-me-another-doughnut) Abbott. He did this without any thought of personal safety or injury. Perhaps she sat on his head? This would account for his erratic behaviour.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>haha touche</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>But how do you overcome the gag factor?</p>

<p>JR you're such a cynic. Are you suggesting that this was not real luuurve? As you know most men fall in love with their eyes and who could resist La Abbott?</p>

<p>She`s a cuddly ` Abbottapotamus`. A rare beast indeed. (Thank goodness).</p>

<p>You'll be telling us he doesn't bow enough degrees at the cenotaph next! LOL!<br/>Did you fight in the school yard with your funny hat on?</p>

<p>I can certainly assure you that he does not have any degrees at all, having failed in his attempt to gain a polytechnic degree. This marks him out as both dull and without grit. Never mind JC won 60% of the vote in a recent Labor Party election! Next stop, electoral  oblivion. Joy unbounded.</p>

<p>That's it then. Anyone without a degree has no place in society - or am I misquoting you?</p>

<p>No Leroy but you are being deliberately disingenuous. A man who cannot manage more than two very poor A-levels at E grade, who cannot gain admission to a good university, who gains admission to a third-rate polytechnic and who then fails to gain a polytechnic degree shows a paucity of intellect that creates an immediate suspicion as regards his capacity to hold high office. If you had remained a a member of a trade union organisation or perhaps it's intellectual equivalent, a blacksmith I would have no trouble with this intellectual shortcomings. Add to this his terrorist sympathising predilections and his palpable lack of sound judgment and you have a man unfit to govern. I hope this has now cleared up any confusion that you might have been under.</p>

<p>To be clear, I agree with your sentiment (about Corbyn's suitability for office), however, if you're going to patronise someone about their lack of intelligence, you should probably learn the difference between its and it's.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Hmm...I'm going to have to disagree with you there... for the simple reason that that's <b>exactly</b> what I did (only I couldn't even get an HND in the subject I wanted to have a career in) - yet, outside of academia, I've basically done very well for myself. I'm just a bit pants at exams...</p>

<p>I have no view on Corbyn's intelligence (or otherwise) - what he does seem to lack is any kind of common sense.</p>

<p>Surprising I have a view on Corbyn's intelligence. He is a dullard. I appreciate that many people do not gain degrees and do very well in life. Bill Gates is a prime example. Had the terrorists sympathising JC achieved anything in the real world I would not be so sure in my judgment. Alas, having failed a polytechnic degree he entered the closeted world of the trade union apparatchiks, local government and then an undistinguished time on the back benches. He has achieved precisely nothing with his life except to ensure that the Labour Party, once of Attlee and Bevin, is consigned to electoral annihilation. He knows what he's doing and that is his aim. No further evidence needs  be brought to demonstrate this man's woeful lack of intelligence.</p>

<p>All true - although I'm not convinced Bevin was that clever either - it may have taken longer for his broken policies to cause major damage - but look at the state (pardon the pun) of the state pension &amp; the NHS now...</p>

<p>Bevin, like all politicians, wanted the glory of his bright ideas while he was still a minister, with the result that the NHS is at least a 2-tier postcode-lottery disaster of a health service (despite the best efforts of many who work for it), and the rest of the welfare state has become a crippling burden on the few of us who are still working &amp; paying taxes...</p>

<p>Whilst I do agree with a lot of what you say, I must point out that Bevin was nothing to do with the NHS. It was in fact Nye BEVAN that introduced it in 1948. The originator of the structuring was William Beveridge who shaped the format at the instigation of Winstone Churchill in 1942 when Prime Minister. It was agreed between Churchill and Attlee his deputy, that whoever came to power after the war would implement the NHS. In fact BEVIN was totally against it as were 110 Labour MP`s, and voted against it. Bevin referred to the idea as `a cheap local ambulance scheme`. Luckily for Britain, they eventually saw sense and Bevan introduced it. This was not `Labours NHS` but Beveridge who was a Liberal MP thought the thing through.</p>

<p>Whoops, my apologies, I wasn't aware there was a Bevin AND a Bevan - I was thinking of Nye Bevan in my comments.</p>

<p>In truth, pointing at Labour, or the Liberals, or the Tories and saying "incompetent glory-seeking short-termists" is - pardon the pun - pointless; it's a failing in all politicians (more so recently than in the past), and is IMHO mainly down to the short electoral cycle - that and the rise of the career politician, rather than those of bygone ages who considered it more of a duty or calling, than a profession.</p>

<p>Apology accepted, and thank you for your dignified reply.</p>

<p>Apology accepted. It`s a perfectly understandable mistake. Nice post anyway !. Bevin was the big union man that thought pay rises more important than an NHS. A typical Labour `caphead`.</p>

<p>I thought we'd dealt with your (and our failing PM's) silly allegations about "terrorist sympathisers" in a separate discussion - but ho-hum....have you ever thought outside your tight "must have a degree to be clever" box and heard of the phrase "common sense" (which not all degree holders have, as I'm sure you'll agree)?</p>

<p>I make no allegations about the dullards terrorist sympathies. These are well-known as his friends in Hezbollah and Hamas will happily attest to. These are facts – unpalatable to you and many of his supporters I know but facts nonetheless.</p>

<p>As regards JC's obvious lack of intellect which you seem to think it can be made up I way of "common sense". Is this the common sense that he has recently shown in supporting a fraudster? A fraudster who has directed the proceeds of his crime towards ISIL?  Heaven help us if this, just the latest in a long line of misguided actions, is an example of Jc's  putative "common sense."</p>

<p>Regardless of his lack of common sense, his lack of intellect is even more worrying. This is a complex world, with complex decisions to be made; decisions that are quite beyond the intellectual capacity and ken of a man cannot even get polytechnic degree. For goodness sake a polytechnic degree! The man's a fool.</p>

<p>There y'go again! "dullard" in your first line. "terrorist sympathies" - but again, like Cameron, without being able to prove it other by inference and innuendo! And when the full quote is explained to you - you just ignore it and stick to your "spin" agenda!! Never mind the facts eh?</p>

<p>I love the "complex world" bit - reminds me of the senior army officer who had to remind Cameron that the real world of the military was a little more complex thatn the life of an "Eton Cadet" when he tried to interfere in strategy.</p>

<p>Still - as Cameron said - "You do the fighting, we'll do the talking"!!</p>

<p>It is a matter of common cores that the inability to gain a polytechnic degree marks JC out as a dullard, particularly when he has  failed to succeed by any measure in the real world. (The trades Union industry, local politics and Westminster on not the real world.)</p>

<p>As I keep reminding you as long as he has friends in Hamas and Hezbollah he is marked out as a terrorist sympathiser. I said this long before David Cameron and I'm not alone in that view.</p>

<p>Nice try at deflection, but we are discussing the dullard who is currently and somewhat unaccountably the leader of Her Majesty's loyal opposition. Let us confine our discussion to his pitiable intellect and lack of judgment.</p>

<p>Winding the Corbynites up on the Guardian is funny - they're twice as self-righteous over there and can't take any criticism.</p>

<p>Nice hat btw</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>They only think they're smarter than us. Most of them have either failed to get a degree like their beloved JC, or have degrees in  "media and communications" or  "feminism" or my personal favourite  "race relations". Their gainful employment is generally as diverse city offices for the local left-wing counsel or perhaps as members of a trades union Council. No wonder they're all so stupid.</p>

<p>I am bound to say JR that I feel sorry for those committed teachers in the government sector who soldier on despite the obvious handicaps of having to work within that system. Although I was not educated within that system I've met several who are excellent teachers and despair at the infiltration into their ranks of left-wing ideologues.</p>

<p>I think your hat is funnier than any of that!</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Well done that man. Finally came to your senses! (ditch the hat - you know it makes sense)</p>

<p>Corbyn is an honest socialist...So he does and says what transparently honest socialists say and do......But for some reason this seems to upset Dan Hodges, as well as annoying his personal hero and mentor Tony Blair....</p>

<p>Hodges was right.</p>

<p>Reported on the Guardian website:</p>

<p>"Jeremy Corbyn has hailed Stop the War as “one of the most important democratic campaigns of modern times”, and accused the coalition’s critics of trying to close down debate.</p>

<p>The Labour leader gave a staunch defence of Stop the War at its Christmas fundraising dinner on Friday night, after calls from some figures within the party for him to withdraw from the event and cut links with the group."</p>

<p>Why should he cut links with the group?</p>

<p>Because this is what his friends in Hamas teach their children.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.new.spectator.co.uk/2014/05/hamas-tv-teaches-children-to-kill-all-jews/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.new.spectator.co....</a></p>

<p>What about what David Cameron's friends in Saudi Arabia teach their children?</p>

<p>They are equally as bad when it comes to antisemitism yet they do at least have some concept of due process (even if wecdon't agree with it).</p>

<p>STWC have no problems codemning Saudi but champion Hamas and Hezbollah.</p>

<p>Hypocrites of the highest order. </p>

<p>Can you seriously entertain the idea of a British Prime Minister who has extremely strong links to a group who openly support anti-democratic terrorist organisations who are determined to destroy Western civilisation?</p>

<p>Even grubby Corbyn skulked in the back door - the spineless git.</p>

<p>for the same reason the Green party leader did, dubious and worrying activity.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn is much, much worse than  the seldom- lamented Chamberlain (who was guilty of appeasement and cowardice but was not a supporter of the Nazis.) JC the dullard. who cannot even finish a polytechnic degree, is, by his actions, revealed as terrorist sympathiser. His support for his  "friends" in Hamas and Hezbollah, his affection and closeness with the murderous IRA means that he is a natural sympathiser with all movements that are anti-West, anti-US and anti-UK. He is a self-proclaimed pacifist who would not use Britain's nuclear deterrent under any circumstances. Can you imagine this pitiful excuse for a human being being allowed to be in charge of British foreign policy?</p>

<p>His fellow travellers in the Stop The War coalition are a loose collection of terrorist sympathisers, pacifists and those who openly support the dictatorial murderous Asad regime.  They cannot see ISIL as the  dangerous death cult that it is. They believe that the attacks in Paris were warranted. They secretly, and not so secretly, support the aims of all anti-Western movements including those dedicated to the destruction of Israel. they are the real enemies of our liberal humanist democracy.</p>

<p>Dan Hodges correctly points out the contempt that JC holds the ordinary British voter in. JC knows he is dismantling the modern British Labour Party and with it the hopes of all of those who wish to support a moderate social Democrat agenda.  If Momentum and Jeremy gain full control of the Labour Party apparatus it will be unelectable for a generation. He cares not to jot.</p>

<p>Dan Hodges has, over the past several months, correctly predicted exactly what JC and his fellow travellers would do and what would happen when they did it. Once again this article proves that Dan Hodges has got Jeremy Corbyn's number.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>He's not a pacifist. He is a mendacious hypocrite. </p>

<p>Nice hat JR. In Jeremy Corbin's dull and misguided brain I think you can be both a pacifist and supporter of Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA. As long as you are not doing the killing maiming torturing and bombing you can sit in your saintly Islington fastness and pontificate on the soi  disant just causes that these terrorist organisations have.</p>

<p>I think your investment in the future of the Labour Party is paying dividends.</p>

<p>Your use of "friends" above betrays you as yet another who twists and spins parts of quotes to suit your argument. Corbyn's argument was that you only achieve a solution by discussion with those you need to agree the solution with. He then went on to say that he did not agree with Hamas and Hezbollah - but on an individual basis, he did come to regard some of the people he negotiated with as friends on a personal basis. What's your beef with that??</p>

<p>Despite your effort to explain away JC's use of the word "friends" I take its word in its plainest meaning. He could've used the word "representatives" just as easily. His choice of language is clear, unambiguous and leaves no room for equivocation. Doubtless he regrets making plain his terrorists sympathies. His support of the ST WP is simply another step in a long line of terrorist sympathising and anti-Western supporting behaviour. Dan Hodges has pointed this out many times and he has been right up to now.</p>

<p>I wasn't "explaining away" - I was reminding you of what he actually said.<br/>Cameron's allegation that Jeremy Corbyn and others are  somehow "terrorist sympathisers" - as repeated by you above - remains a disgraceful utterance by a fading PM and demeans the post of UK Prime Minister.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Maybe he's just preparing the ground for Corbyn...?</p>

<p>I have no view on the Prime Minister's allegation except to say that Jeremy Corbyn's characterisation of the  Members of Hamas and Hezbollah as his friends marks amount as a man amicable and sympathetic to those organisations. Hamas and Hezbollah are without have been openly declared terrorist organisations and therefore I declare JC the dullard and open and committed terrorist sympathiser.</p>

<p>Your PM is currently running around Europe looking for support for what is, after all, just his "fudge" - and yet he is willing to call anyone "friends" to achieve it. <br/>Funny old game politics!</p>

<p>guilty by association its disrespectful to the victims</p>

<p>Dan Hodges is a genius. Fact.</p>

<p>In spite of the crazy rant above?</p>

<p>The logic is clearly irrefutable and undeniable.</p>

<p>Unless you take the blinkers off, of course......</p>

<p>One of the Stop the War wimmin was on C4 News this evening, ranting away at Cathy Newman. My God, she'd have frightened a police horse.</p>

<p>You scare too easily.....and so does the horse..</p>

<p>History tells us all that to ignore the Nazi threat back in the 1930,s resulted in WW11.Chamberlin trusted what Hitler told him he waved a paper about stating the promise.It is now 2015 and once again this country faces a threat but un like back in 1939 this threat comes from within our own borders because some idiots from previous governments and this one we have been lumbered  still believe in the P.C. brigades view of we cannot offend anybody.Well the real world don,t work that way,these people want to kill or enslave us all who are not of there faith.Now myself I am all for holding out the hand of friendship but when it is spat on and ridiculed then it is time to use the other hand an knock the living s**t out of them. pussyfooting around we ether stand up and be counted or do what the P.C. brigade say and let these barstewards cut our heads off.There is a time when peace is not an opition.Peace is fine if the otherside think the same all I see is b*gg*rs wanting to kill use and change our way of life.Well f**k them and the sodding peace movement.</p>

<p>You really need to actually read some history, or put more water with it when you are reading some.<br/>As for the real world... tell me have you ever visited the planet earth?</p>

<p>Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear</p>

<p>It's Dan's daily rant. Blah, blah, blah</p>

<p>But what is going to cause ructions among the anti-Corbyn, pro-Trump UKIP/BNP types is the news that The Donald was an IRA supporter.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/news/trump-has-a-harsh-stance-on-terrorism-in-2015-in-1995-he-shook-hands-and-partied-with-the-ira-leader" rel="nofollow">http://news.nationalpost.com/n...</a></p>

<p>Stand back and watch heads begin to explode.</p>

<p>This is clearly a joke posting. One does not have to support anything other than a liberal humanist democracy to be an implacable opponent of the Jeremy Corbyn. This pacifist terrors sympathising, anti-Western fool has thrown his lot in with an organisation that believes ISIL were in no small part justified in making their Paris attacks inter alia. We know where Jeremy stands now and the majority of the British electorate stand against him.</p>

<p>"I write in despair. Despair of course at the depravity displayed by the murderers of innocents in Paris tonight"</p>

<p>Describing ISIS as depraved murderers doesn't seem to a very sympathetic or point to believing the attack to be have been "justified" as you claim.</p>

<p>Need I do more than quote the following "he is honouring an organisation that claimed Paris had “reaped the whirlwind”.  This is support for an organisation that  justifies and explains the murderous activities of ISIL.</p>

<p>Saying that the west is 'reaping the whirlwind' is not justification, it is explanation.  Nothing justifies Paris but the west has created the conditions, or at least made them a lot worse, in which these vile ideologies and their accompanying actions have been able to grow, take hold and spread.</p>

<p>This is a campaign of sheer mischieviousness by Corbyn's opponents.</p>

<p>You should at least read the original Counterpunch article in the link I posted.</p>

<p>Booom<br/>1st one</p>

<p>Glad to put you right dear boy</p>

<p>Damn you lack of self awareness  must be a blessing to you</p>

<p>Still glad to keep putting you right  dear boy</p>

<p>"To those hundreds of thousands of Labour Party members and former Labour<br/> Party members who didn’t vote for me, I have the same message. Screw <br/>you."</p>

<p>What a complete travesty of democracy.   A man wins 60% of the vote in a four cornered contest and yet, according to Hodges, his prime duty is to the people who didn't vote for him!  What percentage of the electorate (never mind the electorate as a whole) voted for the Tories at the last election Mr Hodges?  35% or something like that?  In which case, David Cameron should be saying "Screw you, people who voted for me!  It's the 65% of people who didn't vote for me I care about!  Screw you!"</p>

<p>And screw you too, Dan Hodges!</p>

<p>Harry I think you should distinguish between 35% of the total electorate who voted for David Cameron and the Tory party and 60% of the members of the Labour Party who voted for the dullard JC. Undoubtedly a man who could not even get a polytechnic degree is now leading the party of Bevin and Attlee and leading it to electoral doom, but to compare the two is plainly nonsense.</p>

<p>I do distinguish between leadership elections and general elections, it's Corbyn's opponents who don't by constantly going on about the millions of electors out there who allegedly don't like Corbyn.  The point is that by any normal standard Jeremy Corbyn won a massive 60% of the votes in a four cornered contest for Labour leader, a contest that involved many more people voting than ever before.  If this was a victory by a Blairite candidate it would be unquestioned as a huge victory by him or her to command the loyalty and support of the party as a whole.  Bur because it's a candidate of the left we get this blatant campaign to destabilise him and bring him down 'from day one' just as Simon Danczuk threatened and all kind of spurious arguments employed such as the one advanced here by Hodges, moaning about the minority of voters who voted for the other three candidates.  Let me reiterate, general elections are for the electorate as a whole, party leadership elections are for the party concerned though if you really think the wider electorate should vote in leadership elections the huge irony is that Labour actually made that practically available in the much derided (by the right), £3 voter scheme.  Unfortunately for the right, it was Jeremy Corbyn who attracted such votes and not the three other 'voter friendly' candidates so, of course, the whole thing was illegitimate (not that it made much of a difference to the overall result anyway).</p>

<p>It's worse than that - only 26% of the people in this country gave the Tories the "mandate" they keep claiming......</p>

<p>Leroy. Please check the meaning of parliamentary democracy then check the number of Tory members of Parliament. You will find that this is in fact a mandate despite your own while the prejudiced view.</p>

<p>Don't need to my friend. The "constituency" nonsense is anything but democratic. It leads to parties like UKIP getting 4M votes but only one MP. It does not provide representation of what the people think. And of course the tories are allegedly about to fiddle the boundaries of "constituencies" in their favour.<br/>Just because it exists now as our electoral system doesn't mean it represents "democracy" - as you call it.</p>

<p>Alas Leroy you may disagree with the form of democracy currently used in the UK. Your objections may even have some merit but parliamentary democracy is what we use and what has been recently endorsed in a referendum. In your judgment it may not be democracy but it is democratic. And, the great thing about this democracy is if you don't like it you convert for the party that wants to change it. That would not be the Labour Party of course but it would be any one of the fringe parties. Which one would you be voting for?</p>

<p>"That would not be the Labour Party of course but it would be any one of the fringe parties."</p>

<p>Fringe parties are totally f***ed in FPTP as you well know, that's why even a party as popular as UKIP (who I don't like but that's not the point) end up with one MP from 4m votes.  As for the voting system referendum, it was not a vote on PR vs FPTP it was a vote on AV vs FPTP,  AV is not PR and its advantages over FPTP are quite difficult to discern.  PR, on the other hand, whether you agree with it or not, has much more clear and understandable arguments.   That's why the Tories would not concede a referendum on it, only permitting one on what even Nick Clegg called the 'miserable little compromise' of AV.  Not that that stopped the power hungry toad from accepting it.</p>

<p>My view is much easier than that. A "party" (of whatever colour) elected by 26% of the people it seeks to inflict its policies on, has no claim to a "mandate". Clearly, it has not. And clearly, whatever system "elected" it has more holes than a sieve and is not "democracy".</p>

<p>Something like 9m people voted for labour based upon a manifesto that Corbyn has now ripped up.  Democracy? Pah.</p>

<p>9.3 million actually and all the leadership candidates rubbished the manifesto the day after the general election.</p>

<p>Yeah, they said it was too left wing.<br/>Go figure.</p>

<p>So, what you're saying is, 9.3 million people voted for a bunch of liars and/or hypocrites.</p>

<p>The really stupid thing is - most of those 9.3 million people will make the same barmy mistake in 2020!</p>

<p>And I suppose Blair never ripped up the manifesto of 1992?  Party members elect a new leader for a new direction.</p>

<p>That doesn't mean the other 8.7m people who voted labour don't deserve a little respect.</p>

<p>Personally, I find it quite impossible to respect anyone who ever votes Labour....</p>

<p>And what respect did New Labour give to Labour voters who didn't agree with Tony Blair?  It's just a nonsense and Corbyn is being held to a standard that just doesn't apply to others.  The fact is his critics just can't deal with the fact he won the Labour leadership fair and square, and with a huge mandate, so they come up with all kinds of rubbish to avoid this fact and justify the campaign to destabilise and bring down his leadership which has been in operation from "Day One" (S. Danczuk) of him winning.</p>

<p>He did win fair and square. So did Hitler.</p>

<p>And the information being published about him on a daily basis is horrible. Disgusting even. What makes it worse it that it's all true.</p>

<p>Oh dear. call Mr Godwin in.  I don't always agree with him but that comment was a mark of true desperation.</p>

<p>Obviously I am not suggesting Corbyn is Hitler. Just because he was elected fair and square doesn't change the fact that what has been published about him is true. </p>

<p>"Obviously I am not suggesting Corbyn is Hitler."</p>

<p>So why mention him then?</p>

<p>Clearly I was highlighting the irrelevance of your comment. </p>

<p>Yes, very clear.  That's what you should always do when you want to clearly allege that someone's comment is irrelevant.  Mention Hitler.</p>

<p>Faux outrage. How predictable. </p>

<p>No outrage here.  You just haven't been able to explain yourself.</p>

<p>It doesn't require an explanation. Anyone with any sense would have understood exactly what I meant.</p>

<p>Even you did. You're clearly just arguing for the sake of it. </p>

<p>What I understood your comment as meaning is the fact that Corbyn was elected fair and square doesn't matter because Hitler was elected fair and square also.  I really think that's how most people would understand your remark.  So why would you mention Hitler if you weren't comparing Corbyn to Hitler?</p>

<p>Nearly there. The point is not that he was elected fairly, but what he stands for, who his associates are and what he would do if elected.</p>

<p>That is why it is crucial that we repeat, loud and often, the type of person he is, who he associates with and what he would be likely to do if elected.</p>

<p>He has spun lie after lie since being elected and it is only right that he is properly scrutinised. </p>

<p>It is crucial that he is repeatedly smeared, has quotes distorted and taken out of context, that's what you mean.  That's what the mainstream media and the right wing press in particular are doing day in, day out.  All because he threatens the interests of a relative few very rich and powerful individuals and wants a fairer deal for the ordinary people.</p>

<p>No, what I mean is that it's crucial the truth is reported so that people are aware of what he is really like, as opposed to the false persona he tries to project. </p>

<p>Oh Dan,<br/>Do be fair, JC has loads of admirers, inside and outside the Labour Party, but not that many in the PLP, which counts for little now, anyway.</p>

<p>I assume you're talking about Jeremy Clarkson</p>

<p>Question: Do 'Stop the War' campaign in Birmingham, Dewsbury, Luton and Tower Hamlets against  the 'Jihadi crusaders' with no links to Syria who have been recruited from there to travel to wage war against the indigenous people in Syria, on behalf of the beheading, crucifying and burning alive cult that is ISIL?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>I'm not sure that the "involvement in Syria" bit is really very important to them.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>The details in the 'Christmas bail' story were so unrelated to the headline that headed the 'story'.</p>

<p>Corbyn was asked to write a letter giving his view on whether the prisoner would jump bail. This is part of his job as an MP. He pointed out that the prisoner had family here and there was no risk: end of story.</p>

<p>Read the article and not just the headline: Evil Corbyn supports Muslim who conned old age pensioners-or something like that.</p>

<p>well that says it all.. he said there was no risk of a terrorist financier jumping bail... what great judgement he has..good job the Judge thought that the letter was a load of bollox</p>

<p>read the article.</p>

<p>I did, read my reply</p>

<p>We can but pray.</p>

<p>For anyone wondering just how bad STWC's good friends at Hamas are, read the article below.</p>

<p>These are the good guys apparently. </p>

<p>They're not exactly Margo and Jerry from 'The Good Life' are they?</p>

<p>Postal Votes?  Shhhhhh...</p>

<p>Corbyn went into the Stop The War event tonight through the back entrance.</p>

<p>He really is a spineless little s**t.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn is much worse than a coward, he is a terrorist sympathiser and has now been revealed as a supporter of an organisation that has in part justified the Paris attacks. His judgment is so flawed and his intellect so weak and is character so poor that he will make labour unelectable for a generation.</p>

<p>LOL! Some Tory nobody on the internet has the nerve to call someone else spineless! You people have the gene for a backbone completely missing from your DNA.</p>

<p>How do you explain Corbyn skulking in the back entrance then, if not spineless?</p>

<p>blimey, are you hoping that Jezza will screw you too!!, would you prefer it if Jezza uses either the front, side or back entrances.</p>

<p>He's not that good.</p>

<p>Pathetic, isn't he?  Doesn't even dare to walk in the front door and explain to the press why he's amongst such odious company.</p>

<p>Says more about the press, methinks.......</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>You really need to ask that after the diss campaign by the London media since he was elected? Really?</p>

<p>Plenty of other media to persuade too.</p>

<p>You support skulking in the back door then?</p>

<p>I'll leave that to you - you appear to have some experience in that area...</p>

<p>I'm not sure how deliberate your pun was in your post.<br/>He's the sort of thing that emerges from the back exit.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Look, Dan, just give in to the inevitable and snog him, OK? The tsundere erotic tension is getting beyond a joke now.</p>

<p>He's conflicted. What about his former crush Ed?</p>

<p>He hated Ed.<br/>He was in love with David.<br/>Try to keep up.</p>

<p>You're all wrong. It is, and always has been, Tony Blair. He yearns for those halcyon days again.</p>

<p>That's why he loved David. Blair's representative on earth.</p>

<p>Arnt those that are opposed to devastation,mass killings and for social justice so deserving of the continual venom from the elite supporting DT?</p>

<p>Don't make me laugh. <br/>STWC support devastation, mass killing and the persecution of gays, women and religious minorities as carried out by their good friends in Hamas and Hezbollah. </p>

<p>Absolutely correct, are you sure. Don't forget that the STWC also rationalise and partly excuse the Paris attacks. In their hearts they are anti-Western and pro anything that has as its object the bringing down of our liberal humanist democracies. Their fellow travellers, like JC in the Labour Party cannot adjust for parliamentary democracy and the PLP knows it. Hillary Benn exposed JC for what he was, a quisling of terrorist organisations. I'm certain that his friends in Hamas and Hezbollah are cheering him  to the rafters. Whilst the leaders of ISIL applaud him quietly whilst they plot the next  murderous adventure.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Actually Hamas' preferred method is to tie them to the back of a truck and drive around for a while. Different method, same result.</p>

<p>Nice. </p>

<p>I don't think that's for gay people.<br/>The Quran says throw them from a high building.<br/>The lorry ride is for other offences.</p>

<p>I think they like to do a little mix and match in Gaza, you know, spice it up a little. <br/>Bring it into the 21st century. </p>

<p>I'm still not convinced.<br/>After all, the fake God they believe in told them high buildings, so high buildings it has to be.</p>

<p>Those who are opposed to devastation and mass killings are presently bombing Syria to stop it happening.<br/>Good for them.</p>

<p>There is part of me that wants to respect Dan Hodges for his gift of the gab, for his occasional gumption. But then I remember how he reacts when his pet hates are tickled, and it reminds me of Mussolini. And then I remember that he is an illiberal fascist. 'So srew you Hodges', to quote the fascist.</p>

<p>Scratch a socialist and you'll find a fascist/communist underneath.</p>

<p>You are aware that fascism and communism represent diametric ends of the political spectrum, I take it?</p>

<p>actually there are no ends to the circle that is the politics of the left and right</p>

<p>It's not a circle, no matter how much you want to believe it. Fascism is a right wing system. Just type fascism in Google and see what pops up first.,..</p>

<p>Did you google "fascism"?</p>

<p>yes - did you see that Fascism sits next to Totalitarian which sits next to Communism to show that the circle of politics connects the far left to the far right through Totalitarian... the fact is that the far left and the far right have the same aims...</p>

<p>What was the first thing that came up, before you even hit enter?</p>

<p>is this a test...<br/>1. Fascism<br/>2. Definition of Fascism<br/>3. Fascimo<br/>4. Fascism in Italy...</p>

<p>Like looking at a horseshoe, think about it.</p>

<p>Do you understand the word diametric?</p>

<p>Such touching naivete - they are but labels sonny.</p>

<p>Sure, keep telling yourself that, if it helps you sleep at night.</p>

<p>You can't put a razor between them. The two systems are almost identical.</p>

<p>Of course you can<br/>Ownership of the means of production is vastly different<br/>Internationalism verses Nationalism also adds to the vastness of the distance between them.<br/>If you are talking about dictatorships, then you could have a point as a dictatorship is a dictatorship regardless of political leaning. But the difference between fascism and communism is huge.</p>

<p>Do not agree. Forget your Trotsky manuals. Read History. Musso started out as a commie. He invented fascism on the fly. Then became as a Stalin/Hitler in viciousness and after that ideology went out of the window. That applied to Hitler and Stalin. All that these fascists were interested in was violent power. To me fascism has a nice stupid ring to it,so that is what I use instead of the ungainly 'totalitarian'. Capisce?</p>

<p>Feel free to re-invent the meaning of words all you want.. but don't expect others to accept it.<br/>A lot of neo-Cons started out as Trots, but there they are today pioneers of the new Internationalism - Global Capitalism. So your point is ill made.<br/>Communism is not fascism, can't ever be because they oppose each other in every important aspect.</p>

<p>fas·cism<br/>ˈfaSHˌizəm/<br/>noun<br/>an authoritarian and nationalistic right-wing system of government and social organization.<br/>- (in general use) extreme right-wing, authoritarian, or intolerant views or practice.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>They're pretty capitalistic, these days. Hadn't you noticed?</p>

<p>yes they are - do you have any idea why?...</p>

<p>It is because their brand of socialism failed on a massive scale with widespread starvation and poverty, with outdated industry so they had to change.. because despite its faults Capitalism actually works better than Socialism</p>

<p>Yeah, capitalism is working great for the Western world, huh? Inequality exceeding levels seen in the 20's. Decent paying jobs outsourced to countries with zero labour laws and cheap labour. You claim to be working class?</p>

<p>Oh dear dreamer, no system is perfect. Did you look at the latest Socialist Garden of Eden to collapse, Venezuela... Socialists came to power with nothing and because they were so concerned about inequality, whatever the hell that means, they made themselves rich with Chavez's daughter coming out on top with $4 billion... I wonder if that special socialist shared it out...</p>

<p>Human greed can be found everywhere. For an example, the Greek financial problems were caused by their conservative government neglecting to enforce taxation for years. There are bad examples on both left and right, but I'd rather have a decent, moral man like Corbyn than what we have currently.</p>

<p>Again you are ignoring the facts, the source of this is my Greek friends and his parents who are in despair...<br/>The Greeks have NEVER paid their taxes under the numerous left and right wing Governments, what happened was inevitable when they finally ran out of other peoples money to spend... as in "the trouble with socialism is that it always runs out of other peoples money to spend" ..</p>

<p>It's always right wing governments who fail to enforce tax codes. What is the amount of unpaid tax in the UK, now? Give you a hint - there would be no deficit if taxes were enforced. Cameron laid off half of the investigators and completely ignored the lists supplied by the Swiss, as they are his buddies who are doing it.</p>

<p>bow locks - of the last 21 Greek Govts 10 of them have been the Panhellenic Socialist Movement..note the middle word..2 have been SYZRYA and 3 have been no overall control, so only 6 centre right.. there is your theory on right wing governments destroyed, you really should engage research before engaging your mouth.<br/>If you research it more closely you will also find it was Gordon Brown who created the loophole for the likes of Starbucks....</p>

<p>No their brand of totalitarianism suits the capitalist system.. that's why they are the darlings of industry</p>

<p>Try telling that to the 15 million or so who died of starvation during the Great Chinese Famine in the Peoples Republic of China..<br/>Your ignorance is appalling</p>

<p>Try living in the present where sweat shops work for Apple, Corporations pay bungs to the Commies for cheap, controlled labour and prisoners are disposable commodities for the use of the captains of industry,<br/>Your water carrying and support for despots is appalling</p>

<p>well let me see - do you think the 15 million dead would rather be alive or working for Apple....</p>

<p>Nurse....</p>

<p>Given that most of them would have died of old age, before Apple moved there I guess the point is moot.<br/>Add to that the number of Apple workers trying to commit suicide rather than live a day longer.. who knows, maybe they wouldn't.</p>

<p>well if it was a moot point why did you compare Apples to famines... (pun intended), normally people chose life over dying from starvation... although I bet you have caused a few to lose the will</p>

<p>Not as many as Apple<br/>But good pun</p>

<p>Never seen so many top end car dealers and Apple shops in my life.</p>

<p>Yup, and lots of dirty money being laundered in London, Vancouver etc.</p>

<p>Communism has never existed on a large scale, but is an economic system in which all production is pooled and then equally distributed as needed among the populace. It is not inherently a political system, but a political system is needed to administer it, and such systems have always been abused.</p>

<p>Fascism is a political system in which rights are granted - or not - by the State. This contrasts to the concepts stated in the Declaration of Independence recognizing that the people hold all rights naturally, and government is only granted permission to carry out legitimate functions. Under fascism, since the state holds all rights, it also retains control over the production of goods, and services. Unlike communism, fascism openly uses the resources to pursue the interests of the government.</p>

<p>Did you learn any Geography, or is communism some sort of romantic idea of what the world was or should be...<br/>Russia - largest country on the planet by area<br/>China - 4th largest country on the planet by area<br/>China - 1st largest country (by far) by population<br/>All of Eastern Europe<br/>Much of Asia and other places..</p>

<p>The other thing you should learn is that Communism has failed everywhere it has taken hold..</p>

<p>I guess you didn't follow the above comment. Russia and China never had true communist systems. They had a political system, rather than a true economic model.</p>

<p>oh good grief... I was right a dreamy eyed romantic that thinks Communism works... well tell me one place, just the one, where it worked and the people are happy and not trying all they can to get out..</p>

<p>The socialist states like Denmark, Norway etc are getting close.</p>

<p>For goodness sake, do some research - they are not true Socialist states. <br/>Denmark:<br/>1. It is a Constitutional Monarchy <br/>2. The current make up of its parliament has the socialists in the minority.<br/>Norway <br/>1. It to is a Constitutional Monarchy <br/>2. The current make up of its parliament has the socialists in the minority.<br/>Try again please</p>

<p>Their policies are very socialist. Look at what they do.</p>

<p>oh dear</p>

<p>Don't like it, huh?</p>

<p>are you Cpl Jones now...</p>

<p>'Communism has never existed on a large scale'</p>

<p>So the USSR and Eastern Europe is on a small scale then.<br/>The rest of your post is equally wrong.</p>

<p>That really wasn't communism, as Marx intended.</p>

<p>That old chestnut. Socialism starts off with the best of intentions, then, inexorably, a new elite manifests itself. Then we have totalitarian communism, which is hardly any different to fascism, which also uses a left-wing economic system while denying the populace freedom.</p>

<p>Read Das Kapital then read Mein Kampf. Then get back to me.</p>

<p>Hilter was actually a fan of Socialism, research some of his social programs they are enlightening. That is why he called his party the National Socialists, excellent article in the Independent about it...</p>

<p>No he wasn't<br/>Once the Strassers were expelled there was no socialist influence within the NSDAP. They then formed alliances with  the Conservatives and the Catholic Church.<br/>Dear gods. If you think that having a word in the title makes it so, then the German Democratic Republic (DDR) was a democracy, as is N Korea.<br/>How do you function independently?</p>

<p>Pleb doesn't really understand the word fascist. He just calls anyone he doesn't like fascist. Typical low-information rightie.</p>

<p>well don't waste your time chatting on here and give it back to them then</p>

<p>Ah the paranoia was all on your side of the aisle.</p>

<p>only because you put it there....</p>

<p>Only you can make you paranoid...</p>

<p>nah one persons definition of paranoia is anthers definition of where the world gets to when you let the left take charge...utter bl**dy chaos.</p>

<p>Chaos is not paranoia.</p>

<p>Just like our man Cameron claiming to be the "party of the working class", huh? It's a standard ploy from the right to pretend to be on the side of the people, when they are anything but.</p>

<p>Yes, all parties in the UK can claim to represent the working class because the simple fact is that they do... I work but don't vote Labour..</p>

<p>LMAO! You're one of the turkeys that vote for Christmas, huh?</p>

<p>well let me see - I lived in an area where my Labour MP was a pervert and earned £7 per week in a factory in a dead end job... I then followed the advice of numerous Tories and got on my bike and found better work - all on my own - I am all set thank you very much.</p>

<p>I paid all my taxes and NI and have never taken a penny of the state that I hadn't already paid in... the very opposite of socialists who want to keep everybody equal - which means at the bottom of the ladder, except for those in power like the aforementioned Chavez</p>

<p>You got any of that kool-ade left?</p>

<p>No, you have already drunk far too much of it...</p>

<p>Ooh, witty comeback!</p>

<p>I read them both long ago at uni.</p>

<p>You obviously didn't understand the differences, huh?</p>

<p>Kapital espouses an economic theory and a critique of capitalism. Mein Kampf espouses a racial theory which has nothing to do with economics.</p>

<p>Mein Kampf is the epitome of fascism. Corporatism gone wild, using racist tendencies to galvanise the gullible.</p>

<p>But that will be bad news for Corbyn if this new Venezuelan government does well.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Notice how right wingers always call the others fascists? Sometime the truth is too close to home. Look at the Trump campaign for illustration : the Republican party members are actually in majority support of this racist/fascist.</p>

<p>again do some research - according to latest polls Trump has about 35% of the conservative vote... I think you will find that it puts him in the minority...</p>

<p>"A new Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey finds that 66% of Likely Republican Voters favor a temporary ban on all Muslims entering the United States until the federal government improves its ability to screen out potential terrorists from coming here. Just 24% oppose the plan, with 10% undecided."

<p>what has that got to do with the majority supporting Trump, he just said it the loudest and left you lefties to jump on another bandwagon.. What you should have said is that the majority support one of his suggested polices, a big difference.</p>

<p>Oh and BTW do I support a temp ban on all Muslims, no I don't.  But I would support a temporary ban while we workout how to stop terrorists in (remember that phrase) ban on Sunni's from Syria, Iraq, Libya and Afghanistan et al....because as America has just seen they cannot be vetted properly and just one or two who slip through the net can cause numerous deaths..</p>
