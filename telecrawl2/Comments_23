<p>Give the man some credit. <br/>Jeremy Corbyn has already provided a more valuable service to his country in the few weeks of his leadership than most politicians achieve in a lifetime. He has demonstrated clearly, albeit unintentionally, that the days of political parties, of whatever hue are numbered. We now have instant communication, we are well-informed and the idea that we need only be referred to once every five years has been tested to destruction. Rather than voting for worn out political parties staffed by fools, knaves and the inexperienced we should be sending 650 proven achievers to Parliament as independents. The very fact that they can have a free vote when it suits 'them' tells us that all votes could easily be free. You can see the detail on the Charter for a Free Parliament website. <a href="http://www.freeourparliament.com" rel="nofollow">www.freeourparliament.com</a> </p>

<p>Is this John McTernan who presumes to lecture Jeremy Corbyn on how to lead his party the same John McTernan whose brilliant strategy work for Scottish Labour lost the party 39 of its 40 seats at the general election?</p>

<p>Labour in Scotland lost 39 of its 40 seats for being corrupt. Just look at Falkirk and the labour run People's republic of Glasgow for the last 100 years.  Corbyn's irrelevant in Scotland, a joke in England and Wales.</p>

<p>These 100 Labour MP's may not like Jeremy Coryn, but voting on air strikes just to make their feelings known is wrong.<br/>The Germans bombed every major city in the UK during the Second World War and they never broke our spirt, <br/>All the bombing in Syria and Iraq so far has not worked and just because we may join in these air strikes won't make a difference.</p>

<p>Labour is finished. What these Bliarites forget is that they lost Fortress Scotland in 2015, but not because they opposed military intervention in the ME.</p>

<p>The Bliarites like nukes, but Scotland doesn't. To win in England alone they will have to out-Tory the Tories …. but it just doesn't work.</p>

<p>As I said .. Labour is finished.</p>

<p>This century will be the century of ageing demographics which translates to a never ending struggle as the rate of increase of future unfunded liabilities is way beyond any realistic economic growth figure.<br/>Unless you believe  UK public  debt can rise  without  limit through this century to match rising liabilities then there is only one answer - cuts.</p>

<p>Any labour/liberal party is a party for spending more to meet new social targets.  I can't see any relevance for such a party in the 21st century as the publci will not pay the ever rising taxes required.</p>

<p>The point that has not been made by Cameron, wrongly I think, is that if ISIS can be removed from their "caliphate" in Syria and Iraq, they would find it much harder to attract support from some caravan in the somali desert. For that reason, a war which removes them from their base seems to me worthwhile.</p>

<p>Corbyn the grade E 'a' level student, dropping out of Polytechnic, struggled as trade union rep....  This with a silver spoon start in life of Private Fee Paying education...</p>

<p>Jeremy is just too limited in his ability to think, he is stuck in 6th form ideas of the world and is unable to change.</p>

<p>He attracts the gullible, naive and the bitter Hard Left.</p>

<p>Could it be that Jeremy Corbyn might be right?  Bombing has not worked so far so why should it work now?</p>

<p>If you feel strongly one way or another, pop along to <a href="http://www.voteEngland.org" rel="nofollow">www.voteEngland.org</a> and register your opinion.  </p>

<p>No. </p>

<p>I am only sorry that Labour have Corbyn and the Tories don't have Farage.</p>

<p>I half agree, it is a pity the Tories don't have Farage but Labour deserve Mr Corbyn, big time</p>

<p>I agree.<br/>I mean that the Labour party have the socialist they should have to lead them.<br/>The Tories should have a conservative.</p>

<p>I am delighted with both.</p>

<p>Really?<br/>Do you think Cameron is a worthy leader of the Tories?</p>

<p>Yes. He wins. Unlike most Tory leaders recently, and unlike Farage.</p>

<p>He wins in a skewed and undemocratic system.<br/>If you admire that, we do not have much more to discuss.<br/>For what it's worth, I have serious reservations about Farage and would not necessarily want him as leader.<br/>But Cameron is a neo-liberal cynic, like Blair. And he is no more a conservative than Blair was a socialist. Just another establishment glove puppet hoping to become a proper hand.</p>

<p>Well. I am very torn about our system. FPTP is based on the idea of each constituency  electing the person that the electors want, and parliament then deciding on a leader. This system has been completely undermined, mainly by the change in the ease of communication between people. So, with the reality of today, FPTP is antiquated. On the other hand, it does usually result in a single party government, who have to be responsible for their own actions and cannot blame their partners in a coalition.</p>

<p>I understand that it seems unfair to UKIP that they got  4 m votes and one MP. I would argue that this is because they spread their effort much too widely and did not concentrate on the constituencies where they really had a chance of winning.</p>

<p>I think Cameron is about as cynical as most politicians, including Farage and Corbyn. Whether the electorate are less sound now than they were, as UKIP posters often suggest, is very open to question. I don't think they are. Cameron is not Churchill, nor is he Thatcher. But both those, and most other respected politicians from the past, may not have appeared so good were they dissected by todays press and communications.</p>

<p>It has worked in Iraq. It is working in Syria.</p>

<p>It's not quite as easy as Call of Duty... tho...</p>

<p>Unlike McTernan, I have lived in the Middle East and airstrikes - they don't work and just engender hate</p>

<p>So you lived there and that makes you an authority, bolllloks....</p>

<p>Airstrikes worked in Iraq and they are working now in Syria but it aint Call of Duty oh Mr Expat.</p>

<p>Nothing quite engenders hate like going to the beach and being gunned down in cold-blood or going to a rock concert and being gunned down in cold-blood.</p>

<p>Jumping on the bombing Syria bandwagon will make no difference whatsoever. Some draconian action closer to home is what's urgently required - Westminster is far too squeamish for that though! We must demand that they grasp the nettle before it is too late.</p>

<p>It has made a huge difference in Iraq, ISIS are in retreat. ISIS are also under pressure in Syria losing ground.</p>

<p>More needed tho.</p>

<p>I imagine they're a bit short on soldiers now they've all gone to Germany.</p>

<p>Corbyn could barely function as a Student Union Leader, let alone a Prime Minister.</p>

<p>I've ticked that he should resign because he is terrible at politics. But surely we should encourage someone who values 1970s student ideas so much more highly than common sense. He is such an asset to the right.</p>

<p>No, please preserve Jeremy Corbyn, he is the best chance we have of making people realise that we need to get rid of political parties altogether and start voting for real people instead.  <a href="http://www.freeparliament.org.uk" rel="nofollow">www.freeparliament.org.uk</a> </p>

<p>I agree in a way and also voted for them. But beware of the means.<br/>In the early 80s Mitterand brought in PR because it suited the Socialists and a generation later the biggest beneficiaries are the Front National.<br/>It could go the other way for us.<br/>All it would take would be leftist nationalists like the SNP to gain a foothold and we would be in it up to our necks.</p>

<p>First past the post in Scotland gave the SNP on 50% of the Vote 56 out of 59 Scottish MPs in Westminster. How would PR be worse?</p>

<p>It could be worse if it gave us real fascists or real communists - both a type of socialist ideology and both scourges to the nations that adopt them.<br/>It's not that I think well of FPTP. It clearly unashamedly and disgracefully supports a very dubious establishment.<br/>I but PR can be so destabilising as to be downright dangerous. <br/>Is there something in between.</p>

<p>Most of them anti-Engish racist MPs too. Unable to face up to the fact that most of Scotland's problems aren't made in England.</p>

<p>Not only to the right, but to all right-minded people who value pragmatism and common sense and liberal western values. JC the dullard terrorist sympathiser is best example of the hard lefts utter conviction that anything capitalist, moderate or honourable is worthless.</p>

<p>Pragmatism and common sense suggest that we stay the hell away from this conflict.  Liberal western values would encourage peace, not war.</p>

<p>Thanks TheRealMrBlobbysRevenge, you have helped me make up my mind on this. It is Liberal Western values that are hated by the likes of ISIL, they want it gone and replaced by a Caliphate with misogynist, intolerant and very illiberal values. So it's just whether the Liberal Western values are worth fighting for or not.</p>

<p>Um, you do realise that Syria and Iraq are in the Middle East, do you not?  No liberal western values there.  Are you suggesting that we should impose them on two sovereign nations?</p>

<p>Opposition to bombing Syria is not an objection to dealing with ISIS. The debate should be about how we deal with them, rather than a Bush-like "with us or against us" on the issue of bombing. It should be pretty clear to anyone who's been awake the last 15 years that rash military action causes more harm than good, and the repercussions can be catastrophic.</p>

<p>Do you want to send them birthday cards and flowers?</p>

<p>This ignorant thinking that it would all have been happy clappy if we just stayed out of it, is moronic.</p>

<p>I think it is past catastrophic. Millions of refugees fleeing the region, the like of which we have never seen, is already pretty catastrophic. People chopping heads off and burning humans alive is catastrophic. I get your point but think that someone has got to say 'you are not going to do that and get off scot free.' I don't see how else they can be dealt with.</p>

<p>I think I prefer a default pacifist position when it comes to launching air strikes, rather than the default position of Hilary Benn and the rest of the new labour dregs who are more hawkish than Cameron, and made up their minds long ago that they wanted air strikes in Syria, around 2013 in fact, when they first got lines to that effect over at Chatham House or wherever else it is they get their 'state sanctioned' talking points from like so many ventriloquist dummies..</p>

<p>Pacifism is for fools....</p>

<p>By 2020 most sensible people will have left and joined a new party (preferably on the centre left which would push the Torys off this ground and maybe we will get a proper Tory party back on the centre right as a bonus)<br/>Labour will be just a twitching corpse.</p>

<p>I doubt that, FPTP means the Labour beast like the Tory party is a hard one to kill. I'm sure they will muddle along for a while, and then we'll get <br/>another 'acceptable' Labour leader, a bit like Miliband but more <br/>photogenic and smooth and there won't be a cig paper between the two <br/>parties again, which is just how the establishment and the media like <br/>it, you can't have people actually thinking there's any real choice to <br/>be had..</p>

<p>Tough one.The head of the snake needs to be cut off for sure, and did I read that the action is beginning to cut off the entrances &amp; exits to much of ISIL? The argument that it will mean more attacks on Britain by IS is not valid. How many attacks have been scuppered this year? Whether we bomb or not won't make any difference to that. But it might stop the training and propaganda coming from Syria, until it pops up somewhere else and we have to do it all again. I think the Corbyn's need to understand that this is long term. The other thing I don't get is when people say all this bombing won't make any difference. A couple of bombs and shooting in Paris made quite a lot of difference, are they telling me that if four or five countries were dropping bombs on Britain it 'wouldn't make any difference' and life would go on as usual? It must make a difference. Even so, I don't know.</p>

<p>The trouble with ISIS is that there is no head to cut.</p>

<p>Of course they have a leadership to destroy.</p>

<p>IS covers Syria and Iraq. That is the head.</p>

<p>Ah, so like Cameron, you just want to bomb everything, willy nilly.  And they wonder why people oppose it!</p>

<p>Yes, I think I do. The whole place is a sh** hole.</p>

<p>Then you deserve to be bombed yourself.</p>

<p>Could well happen. It could come down to either me or a jihadist in Islamic State of Iraq and Levant. After all, the innocent people in Paris and the beach in Tunisia had it coming didn't they?</p>

<p>Only a fool believes that countries that attack others are innocent.</p>

<p>---No. A fool is a sniveling coward who believes if we "play nice," they won't hurt us...</p>

<p>But we have no idea who we are fighting, The opponents of ISIS in Syria are supporters of Al Qaeda so if we weaken Isis who will take their place? We were being asked to bomb Assad's forces not that long ago, who are now fighting ISIS. Also, the next step in bombing is sending in troops-Afghanistan and Iraq has been a disaster costing in lives and money at a time when we are starving our public services.</p>

<p>---Right...."Public services" being so much more important than security.….</p>

<p>If bombing was going to increase security  fair enough but no one has explained how that will happen. We are involving ourselves in a complex civil war. Cameron talks of 70,000 moderates being the boots on the ground but doesn't name this group or their leaders.</p>

<p>The simple question to ask is: are we safer after the invasion of Iraq, Afghanistan and succeeding in ousting Ghadaffi and trying to bomb Assad out of Syria?</p>

<p>The definition of stupidity is doing the same thing agan and again and expecting a different outcome.</p>

<p>Nah hyperbole.</p>

<p>I think suddenly it has become clear who we would be fighting. How many atrocities do you need to know who wants you dead? ISIS claim responsibility for 99% of attacks across the world. That is who we would be bombing.</p>

<p>But do ISIS wear uniforms and march into war? What about Al Quaeda in Syria are we bombing them?</p>

<p>If we do drive ISIS out of their strongholds, which will be heavily populated areas resulting in mass civilian deaths, where will they go? Iraq-then what.</p>

<p>Finally, how will we stop them returning?</p>

<p>I'm sure they wear nice bright high viz vests, just so we can recognise them too!</p>

<p>I doubt that there are few people left in ISIL held territory who are not committed to ISIL, because if there were IS jihadists would murder them.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, if people don't fight against them, they don't murder them, they just let them get on with life.</p>

<p>---Hitler would have LOVED you! (What you're advocating is called, "appeasement")...</p>

<p>We are fighting whoever we are not arming!</p>

<p>Why does the anglo press insist on pandering to this utter failure? McTernan follows no road unless it's his own and preferably with gold lined pavements.</p>

<p>Mind you, he is typical of London Labour, as in ferrets in a sack, and everyone for his own. That's headless ferrets with no direction, no hope and no future.</p>

<p>Scotland has seen this festering  mob off, finally sickened by its nepotism, ignorance and down and out lies. Mmmm, much like the self indulgent Tories and their dodgy money pals.</p>

<p>---Better than the bunch of simpering Socialists in Scotland (your ancestors would roll over in their graves if they knew how dependent on the "State" most Scots have become, how weak &amp; pacifist....)</p>

<p>Scots are backward politically.<br/>Because they are spoon fed with English monies.</p>

<p>Michelle Thompson.<br/>Natalie McGarry.<br/>Glass houses.<br/>Stones.</p>

<p>...and, of course, no guilt, no charges, except for the ignorant and desperate spittle from London Labour (North British Branch) and its base London media pals in feeble attempts to hide their own shortfalls. Massive shortfalls. Not to mention, of course, the proven fiddles without, around and circling London Labour and its dreadfully half arsed leadership.</p>

<p>As of the fat anglo Tories, simply damned and damned by the majority in England outwith their oily pit of London and its sleazy gated environs.</p>

<p>Pick up your own stone Ring. It's heavy and you just ain't my brother.</p>

<p>Hit a nerve?</p>

<p>I would like to think so but, like all pedlars of self indulgent propaganda, as in 1930s European history, I doubt if you have a single one.</p>

<p>I think, your being a low brow follower of insinuation, in common parlance, you would be allocated the badge of 'troll'.</p>

<p>No, you've lost it - that makes no sense at all.</p>

<p>...None whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Telegraphs bottomless obsession with Corbyn is really something to behold, How long can it keep up this level of shrillness. May I would suggest a sit down and a cup of tea.</p>

<p>Until Cameron can realistically show us how bombing another country will stop a British Jihadist running loose in Piccadilly Circus, the case is not made and all bets are off.</p>

<p>....Run and hide with Jem, brave little man....</p>

<p>The Guardian is the same.</p>

<p>That is because Corbyn is an utter fool.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn is not a man I like or trust: is very left wing policies if they ever came to fruition would destroy us completely by being thrown into communist order that would suffocate enterprise and freedom. However, in the Parliamentary Questions he picked up on one mayor point that Cameron was unable to answer, and that was the 70,000 Syrian rebels he assumed would be capable of providing the 'boots on the ground' aspect of the war against ISIL. Their battle is with the despot Assad, as is ISIL's.. Their secondary battle would be against ISIL if ever they could topple Assad. But, with the Russians there, hell bent on obliterating the rebels, Assad is secure from their threats.  But, significantly, the rebels are neither strategically placed or equipped to move against ISIL and with this, Corbyn found Cameron's Achilles heel and left him, and us with a problem of doubt on his strategy.</p>

<p>Kurds, Free Syrian Army, Iranians, Assad's army - They all want to take ISIL territory and get rid of them....</p>

<p>Then you have the peace talks where their bosses (funding &amp; supplies) are negotiating a settlement.</p>

<p>He must be living on another planet unable to grasp the current (quite different from past interventions) situation. This is a nihilistic brutal cult spreading it's tentacles globally. We firmly agree to striking their heartland Syria.</p>

<p>The arrogance of John McTernan and all the other raving progressive leftists at the Telegraph who mock Corbyn.</p>

<p>All of them, including Corbyn share the same extreme leftist ideology (pro-mass immigration, pro-multiculturalism, pro-feminist, climate change believing, EU supporting). Only difference is that Corbyn is a noble socialist which might be seriously awful but nowhere near as subversive and destructive as these corporatist elitist cretins who are far more effective at destroying nation states.</p>

<p>Tosh.</p>

<p>Corbyn is just stuck with 6th former thinking and is not bright enough to change.</p>

<p>Corbyn is due his criticism, but considering John McTernan almost destroyed the Labour Party in Scotland he really doesn't have the authority to make these arguments.</p>

<p>"he demonstrated why he is the Prime Minister – the first among equals".   If a journalist can get away with a comment as stupid as that he can say what he wants<br/>about the Leader of the Opposition.     Forget the sparsely bearded Corbyn, let's<br/>concentrate on the bombing of Syria.    Does any DT commenter really believe that<br/>our wonderful weapons will only kill our enemies and that the brave anti or pro <br/>Assam supporters will be untouched?   Will we be acting in concert with the Russians and the French as well as the Americans?  Will the bombing support the 70,000 <br/>Syrian ground troops - as those troops are situated a long way away from the bomb targets the question answers itself - no!     I've no doubt Cameron will win his vote <br/>just as Blair did 12 years ago but that will be the only win.</p>

<p>If he is against bombing Syria, surely it is reasonable to ask how he proposes to defend this country against ISIS and other Islamic extremists.<br/>Not that I'm convinced that bombing is the solution so I would like Cameron to explain why he believes this action would help defend this country.</p>

<p>It all starts at adequate funding of the border.</p>

<p>Which is rather like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted!</p>

<p>Not at all.  If you never let the terrorists in, you only have to deal with the homegrown ones.</p>

<p>True, but they're in already, and if just 1% of the refugees Cameron is proposing to let in are terrorists, its 200 too many. They'll never sort the genuine refugees from extremists.</p>

<p>"If he is against bombing Syria, surely it is reasonable to ask how he proposes to defend this country against ISIS and other Islamic extremists."</p>

<p>You're making the wild assumption that bombing will make us safer and there doesn't appear to be much evidence of that. Especially considering this death cult is desperate for the bombings to start, we don't need our eager politicians to acquiesce.</p>

<p>If we bomb Syria, how would you intend on keeping this country safe?</p>

<p>I said that I'm not convinced that bombing is the solution. I make no wild assumption.<br/>Hence the question that I'd like to ask Cameron, above.</p>

<p>The worse thing to ever happen to Labour(and Britain) was Tony Blair, Corbyn is just revisiting what Labour used to be.<br/>After Blair, Meddlesome, Prespot &amp; Co, the Labour party will never be trusted again, treasonous to the core, and Cameron is doing himself no favours tying himself to mast of SS Blair.<br/>All the major parties have shown they are untrustworthy, and as for British best interests, they come well down the list.<br/>The time is ripe, for a new politics, that puts Britain and her people first.</p>

<p>I agree. Corbyn is necessary to make the party respectable again. Someone else is necessary to make the party electable again.</p>

<p>Corbyn has some legitimate concerns about military action. Soldiers on the ground will be needed and civilian casualties will stir the fickle civilians to hate the west, again. However, he is poisoning these viewpoints and the media is polarising the debate. His own party is also responsible.</p>

<p>Another issue is that I find myself disagreeing with things his allies have said like Ken Livingston, Abbott etc , more than him. He needs to distance himself.</p>

<p>These developments vindicate my decision, as a Labour Party member, to have voted for Corbyn - on purely Machiavellan grounds. I took the revolutionary's position that 'worse means better'. The "centrist" candidates, Burnham and Cooper, were just pipsqueaks and phonies.</p>

<p>I am praying that Corbyn's leadership will lead to such turmoil that it will ultimately provoke a Bismarckian kulturkampf against the lunacies of political correctness and useful idiocy, Eg.: Labour Constitiency Parties currently have a plethora of nanky-pooh posts such as women's officer, LGBT officer, minorities officer etc, and so forth, but curiously no officer for white hetero males. Pure Animal Farm.</p>

<p>No, it's just because you're so ideologically blinkered, that you can't consider anything that is outside one of your predefined boxes.</p>

<p>My money's on it being a wind-up.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Exactly and that is why I spent 3 pounds to join Labour and voted for him. Every day is another nail in the Labour coffin and hopefully another election success for the Tories in 5 years time. I even looked up who would be the worst deputy (as I didn't know who they were) and put in a vote for him too.</p>

<p>Yeh, course you did. Stop making things up...post your membership number.</p>

<p>Why would I make it up?</p>

<p>Hello John. It's great to be getting in touch with you for the first time as your deputy leader. Thank you for the support you've shown Jeremy and me as we get to grips with our new roles.</p>

<p>It's been a busy few months. We've focussed our energy on the government's damaging proposals on tax credits, defeating them in votes in both the Lords and the Commons. I think we've won the argument that Cameron and Osborne have to ditch this policy but until they relent, the campaign continues with more events across the country this Saturday.</p>

<p>Next week I'm going to a meeting with our National Executive Committee (Labour's governing body). We'll discuss how we make sure members and supporters play a greater role in our party, including big changes to our digital strategy and greater support for organising in your communities. So watch this space.</p>

<p>Best wishes</p>

<p>Tom,</p>

<p>Tom Watson <br/>Deputy Leader of the Labour Party <br/>@tom_watson</p>

<p>membership number?</p>

<p>Why do you want this? Do you work for Labour? I will keep it  thanks and if Corbyn resigns or is kicked out I will again vote for the candidate most likely to make Labour unelectable.</p>

<p>So you think the Labour party are on the hunt for the 5 Conservatives  that paid £3 to vote for Corbyn?</p>

<p>You would also know that the £3 paid entitled the person to take part in the vote but not become a member of the party.</p>

<p>The leadership contest was in September.</p>

<p>So either post your membership number or stop fantasising that you joined to vote for Corbyn. </p>

<p>Wow you really are a bit objectionable as a person aren't you. Actually I believe a lot of affiliates (or what ever they are called - I really don't care as long as the party disappears as an electable option) voted for Corbyn or do you really think I made up the email I posted? And obviously I made up these ones too.</p>

<p>Here's to the next chapter in our party's history,</p>

<p>Iain</p>

<p>Iain McNicol<br/>General Secretary of the Labour Party</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>He's not the deputy.  Wrong once more!</p>

<p>From the point of view that he is a bit of a liability to Labour compared to the other more mainstream candidates - clearly not as insane as Corbyn but it fitted the narrative of trying to ruin them for at least this parliament - I am happy with the results that are displayed in the media on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Actually McDonnell is equally barmy. He suggested "knee-capping" various councillors who would not bow to his whim. Diane Abbott just told the world that Mao - mass murder numero uno by numbers killed (20th Century Division) - did more good than harm.<br/>I cannot make this up.<br/>These are the people that the dullard JC surrounds himself with.<br/>Labour unelectable for a generation under this bunch of clowns. (I am not alluding to La Abbott being under the dullard in any sense of course.)</p>

<p>Yes I do hope so re their unelectability - I cannot remember who the Telegraph journo was that pointed it out (the 3 quid membership) but don't think it could have worked out better.</p>

<p>Labour MPs are cowards and self-interest is their main concern.  They're on the Westminster gravy-train and they don't want to risk being turfed off it.  They're weighing up which is more likely to end in their ejection:   staying loyal to Corbyn and the voters ditching them out in 2020 (at least they'll have another 4.5 yrs of gravy-train riding) or stab Corbyn and possibly be deselected by Momentum when the boundaries come up for review.</p>

<p>Gosh it's a tough one.</p>

<p>The longer he stays the better. Reduce the Labour Party to hiring a phone box for its annual conference like the LibDums.</p>

<p>Every one of Corbyn's questions seems to me to be very much apposite and to the point. Don't get me wrong - I loathe the man - but he is right on this issue. Cameron's policy vis-a-vis Islamic State is half-baked, idiotic, dangerous. There is no credible plan whatever actually to expunge IS from history and replace it by something good. Any credible plan would involve, first, a rapprochement with the only forces on the ground that are capable of really doing something about that poisonous snake.</p>

<p>Churchill's decision to resist Hitler in 1940 could also have been fairly described as half-baked, idiotic, dangerous, as there was at that stage no credible plan to win the war. Sometimes, however, not fighting is worse than fighting, and in my opinion this is one of those times. We just have to hope that a plan to end the chaos in Syria that is acceptable to both Russia and the western alliance evolves once ISIS has been destroyed. Not ideal, but that's as good as it's going to get for the time being.</p>

<p>The horror of Hitler and his annexation of countries was of a far greater threat than a few hillbillies in a country far, far away, who wouldn't be interested in us if we weren't about to bomb them.</p>

<p>"A few HILLBILLIES?" You ARE informed....aren't you?</p>

<p>This is nothing like WW2 but Syria could well unleash WW3. The Syrian government is trying to stop the terrorists, and Cameron wanted to bomb them! Cameron's allies - the Saudis - have done everything they could to fund, train and arm ISIL. They even threatened Russia for attacking their terrorists.</p>

<p>The difference lies in the track record. What about Iraq, what about Afghanistan, what about Libya? This type of criticism couldn't have been leveled at Churchill in 1940.</p>

<p>His questions are pseudo intellectual and an attempt to put a veneer on his "under no circumstances" position".  At least two of them are fatuous such as the UN resolution one (it's a poor attempt to salvage a tactical mistake of pinning their hopes of a Russia or China veto). Talk of a political solution at this juncture is pure verbiage and it is notable the Jezz has absolutely no suggestion of his own on what is best. Anyway Cameron addressed the points.<br/>The hard truth is that it will take years to get rid of ISIS. Sitting in our hands wont make them go away but trying to degrade their capability and gradually take territory and money away is a start. Unlike Al Qaeda, ISIS needs territory and needs success.<br/>As for the "we wont make a difference" line, working with allies is important. The whole is often more than the sum of the parts. If the UK cant support its closest allies in a fight that it has high stakes, how do we expect to convince the local states to act?</p>

<p>Al Qaeda are fighting ISIS in Syria. If we attack ISIS who do you think will take their place? Who are these moderates who are going to attack ISIS, Cameron was a bit vague on that one.</p>

<p>AQ is not fighting ISIS. It is not opposed to ISIS it just has a different spin on the Koran. <br/>Again, no one said there is an easy solution. There are some forces in Iraq and Syria willing to fight ISIS and there are otter's disillusioned by being left in the lurch when the US pulled out. The arab states are potential members of a coalition. None of that will coalesce w/o the key Nato countries getting involved.<br/>But if you have a better idea of how to stop ISIS taking over 2 or 3 countries in the ME, driving millions of refugees to Europe and operating a terror campaign in the EU, all ears. In case you are going there, Assad cannot be a central part of that because he is one of the few unifying factors (negative) in Syria.</p>

<p>I don't have a better idea but we have the foreign office, experts on the situation in Syria, military chiefs and people from Syria who might.</p>

<p>We need to set up a think tank, gather all the evidence and then come up with a solution.</p>

<p>Whether AQ are fighting ISIS is a matter of media speculation but most seem to acknowledge that the relationship between Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS is not stable or uniform, and is instead highly influenced by circumstances. Therefore if ISIS is weakened AQ will fill that vacumn-unless we believe Cameron that 70,000 unnamed moderates ( whatever that means) are going to be our boots on the ground.</p>

<p>Also, where are we going to drive them to. Iraq? How many civilians will we kill in the process and how are we going to stop this group returning? Finally, how many more young Muslims will we radicalise in the process?</p>

<p>With respect that's the same wooly, let's form a  committee, maybe things will get better approach that would be a charitable gloss on Corbyn speak.</p>

<p>The "experts" were consulted and came up with Cameron's statement (do you - and Lab - really think that this isn't a constant topic in government? A senior FO official told me this has been looked at from all angles for months if not years - he is muslim btw and urged military action). And then there are the consultations with allies.</p>

<p>ISIS is quite a different animal. It has a clear caliphate plan and a quite sophisticated government in place. AQ isn't close to being able to "fill the gap" and the idea is to retake the territory and fill the gap with something more mainstream and moderate (not overnight but with long term support). Again, a coalition of the willing wont magic up overnight and certainly wont contact us one day out of the blue. It has to be created over time with consistent commitment (ISIS grew out of a vast black hole of the west making nice enough noises to encourage resistance but then in their eyes leaving them in the lurch).</p>

<p>Civilians are getting killed by the thousands already and will continue to be under ISIS. Not a few collateral damages but a deliberate cleaning. That's one reason millions have left and wants to come to the EU. ISIS has to be eliminated, not driven somewhere. Ironically a fight to the death fits their creed. It means it will be a long (years) bitter struggle.</p>

<p>Again there are no easy answers, no group of clever experts who will supply a painless way out.  ISIS by its very continued existence and perceived success is radicalizing muslims quite nicely.  Since having a caliphate is central to that appeal, degrading that caliphate and taking its territory away is a key way of destroying that appeal (the history of the original caliphate stressed the need to be successful and  expand territory</p>

<p>Although now the experts-foreign journalists, people on the ground, those that fought in Iraq, are questioning the idea of 70,000 moderates to act as boots on the ground. They are questioning the motives of those we may be supporting in Syria.</p>

<p>Camerons plan hinges on those 70,000 because otherwise we will be involved in a civil war with Turkey backing resistance to Assad, Saudi Arabia funding Sunni fighters and Russia supporting Assad and Iran working on the side of the Shia's.</p>

<p>We won't have a clue who are enemy is and who is our friend and it will go the same way as Iraq and Afghanistan. Why wouldn't it.</p>

<p>First it already is Iraq and worse. That concerns us for 2 reasons. First millions want to come to the EU and the instability is threatening to broaden ti the whole ME. Second ISIS is a unique threat that has established a state and has a  very clear goal to kill or enslave us and everyone else who is not their type of muslim. As Ben said so well, sitting in the sidelines hoping someone else will fix it for us is not an option.</p>

<p>'Second ISIS is a unique threat that has established a state and has a very clear goal to kill or enslave us and everyone else who is not their type of muslim. ' Is that really going to happen. They can't even defeat Assad's weakened forces. It seems a case of the U'S led forces exaggerating the threat for their own ends.</p>

<p>I still have no idea why we were being urged to bomb Assad apart from some nonsense about supporting democracy and freedom-something that seems less of a priority when it comes to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Unlike Benn, I think we could have sat on the sidelines and let other countries make the mistakes we are now going to make. I don't see how bombing is going to change anything unless we put troops on the ground and involve ourselves in a long and bloody civil war where we have no idea of the motives or the loyalties of those we think might back us up.</p>

<p>Read the account of Israel's invasion of Lebannon in the 80s for a wonderful example of how to get sucked into a religious and tribal war.</p>

<p>Selective memory. ISIS seized a huge swathe of Syria from Assad and was continuing to advance. Putin intervened because Assad was on the point of collapse.<br/>The idea of bombing Assad 3 years ago was to get him to stop bombing and gassing his own civilians and o bring him to a deal that would allow a semblance of a national govt. The worry was that unless the West intervened the vacuum would be filled by extremists on the muslim side......<br/>Sitting on the sidelines sounds fine but alliances are all about working together. When you freeload your friends cease to be your friends. Plus if you want to locals to get involved you have to show willing too. Anyway since we are already bombing ISIS in Iraq the idea that this is somehow an momentous step is unconvincing.<br/>Israel is such a different case. It was and is a war for land. Israel is just as much an aggressor as the other side and in the case of Lebanon made a distinctly imperialist move.</p>

<p>'The idea of bombing Assad 3 years ago was to get him to stop bombing and gassing his own civilians and o bring him to a deal that would allow a semblance of a national govt. '<br/> Was it? We didn't seem to mind Saddam Hussain gassing his own people.</p>

<p>And if it was, how did that turn out?</p>

<p>Corbyn has asked:<br/>Who buys the oil from ISIS?<br/>Who sells them the arms?<br/>Where did ISIS come from?</p>

<p>Ensuring that no one buys their oil<br/>no one sells them arms<br/>and finding out which governments support them would be more effective than bombing them. It's not standing on the sidelines and it might actually work.</p>

<p>You say that we are bombing woman and children in Iraq so it's not a great leap to bomb them in Syria. Well you didn't because that would be too messy and it's easier to pretend otherwise.</p>

<p>Bottom line: bombing and invading in the middle east has been a disaster. It's made us less safe, it's killed thousands and hasn't achieved it's aims ( or the aims are different to what we are being fed).</p>

<p>20-20 hindsight is a wonderful thing. The realpolitik of the 80s and 90s was very different from today and anyway most commentators would tell you that our handling of Hussain was a disaster from the start and contributed to the problems that followed.<br/>In the case of Assad, his actions were directly adding to the collapse which directly affects us. Apart from that, what good is morality of you areaways going to excuse crimes against humanity by saying, well 30 year ago we were wrong so you can have a pass.<br/>As for Corbyn's list - the work of a sixth former rather than thoughtful analysis - the answer, which he knows or should know, is that everyone in the region buys from and sells to ISIS starting with Assad (he buys oil and electricity). Since we have no way of stopping most of the buyers since they are beyond our control, bombing the oil and electricity installations is a pretty good alternative. We are already doing this in Iraq which seems to have escaped JC's attention.<br/>Are we partly responsible for the mess? Yes and that goes right back to WW1. But that's history and this is the here and now. Corbin's position is that we are always wrong and the terrorists are always fright. After all this is a man who with JM attended IRA memorials and fundraisers, eulogized those who had given their life for "their cause" (a phrase he has also applied to AQ and other ME movements), and who has been incapable of enunciating clearly in speech or his famous typed communications a clear condemnation of these activities that is more than a passing nod before blaming everyone else. He also shows zero appreciation of what is going on, and seem to think that ISIS and AQ will sit down and come to an arrangement if only we ask them nicely. <br/>As for Hilary, he hit the nail on the head. You cant always sit in the sidelines and alliances mean supporting your allies. We expect them to help us and they rightly expect us to help them in something that s designed to helps as well.<br/>I dont associate many of the no votes with Corbynism. It is a complex issue and there are genuine doubts and worries. But Corbyn and co were in a different class (and Cameron stooped low). Both his reasoning and his behavior were new lows in his brief leadership.</p>

<p>I think his point was that if we examine who is selling arms to ISIS and who has funded them-Saudi Arabia seems the a likely candidate-we can put pressure on them to stop, using embargoes and political pressure.  We did this with Iran and that has resulted in talks and progress.</p>

<p>He doesn't think that AQ and ISIS will sit down and come to an arrangement if we ask them nicely( you made that up). Sanctions work. Political isolation works - see South Africa, Iran, Saddam's Iraq- he didn't have WMD, (we were lied to.)</p>

<p>Talks in Ireland have worked. Talks that recognised the IRA's grievances and reasons for their campaigns.</p>

<p>Another Corbyn gloss trying to sound researched while sticking to his usual lost of suspects (Saudis are allies therefore...).  Majority view is that Gulf arabs (not states) gave money in the beginning to ISIS and that mattered back then. And the arms the states to others were traded. The reality today is much more complex and the money comes from oil and electricity which they sell to everyone including Assad and Russians. FT article nicely sums up just how complex and how much enemies are trading with each other. So telling the Saudis that they should stop supplying ISIS (which is not at all clear) is looking in the wrong place.</p>

<p>As for sanctions etc, is he kidding? ISIS doesnt trade with and doesnt recognize any state nor wants us to recognize them. The idea of the caliphate is that it is the only state. The Koran expressly forbids making peace: a 10 year truce with only 1 enemy is as far as it goes. Remember ISIS takes this stuff literally.</p>

<p>As for Ireland you have to laugh since both Corbyn and McDonnell opposed the talks and the peace agreement. JM's recent gloss on how he was praising the IRA in order to get their support for the agreement is pure b/s like his "I-didnt-see-the-piece-of-paper".</p>

<p>There are no "grievances" to recognize with ISIS or even AQ. They believe that there is only one god and his name is Allah. There are no compromises with the rest of us. We are to be killed or enslaved (evangelism is not a big priority). As Christians we are allowed a second class existence as long as we pay a special tax. This stuff isn't negotiable. AQ isn't quite so literal and could wait to conquer us but that's all.</p>

<p>That's the problem with Corbyn. A lot of posing as thoughtful and clever but actually very little beyond facile and obvious.</p>

<p><a href="https://next.ft.com/content/baad34e4-973c-11e5-9228-87e603d47bdc" rel="nofollow">https://next.ft.com/content/ba...</a></p>

<p>Oh well we'll see how bombing works out. Hasn't worked in Afghanistan and Iraq and doing the same thing and expecting a different result is the definition of stupidity but who knows killing more Muslims just might be the answer.</p>

<p>It's not some panacea that is going to produce a quick result. It's a contribution to a joint effort that will start a push back. If it reduces funding and mobility that is something. The mantra "killing muslims" is over used. The targeting has been careful and limited precisely to avoid that which is why many of the US missions have returned without dropping. That doesnt mean it's pointless to join. Allies are supposed to share the work and the broader the coalition the greater the chance that some solutions could be worked out. If Putin would agree to a phase out of Assad, for example, but no one is holding their breath.</p>

<p>You can't push them back without boots on the ground. There is no plan, apart from the 70,000 moderates who ain't very moderate. There is no exit strategy.</p>

<p>Also, who are we getting intelligence from on where to bomb and is it reliable?</p>

<p>Turkey have been allowing ISIS fighters through their borders. What's the strategy to deal with that? The last thing Saudi Arabia want is the Shia's, with support from Hizbollah and Iran to expand their territory, so what is there role in funding ISIS and who do they support in Syria?</p>

<p>Within all this complexity we are going to drop bombs on ISIS. Which won't work because it hasn't worked in Afghanistan, Libya and Iraq. Given results of bombing, even with troops on the ground, doing nothing would be a good option.</p>

<p>Key word; start. 30% of ISIS Iraq has been cleared so far. The oil and electricity is in Syria as well as Iraq so you need to be able to cut it off in both places. You can also cut communications.<br/>Just as in the other wars, the intelligence comes in great part from watching. It's another reason why they dont do that much bombing; it take time to find targets that are not in the middle of cities.<br/>The Turks are a problem although now under pressure to behave and also opposed to Putin (and so Assad). ISIS doesnt need money from the Saudis. It has a huge income from energy. Guess who buys the stuff. Assad and russian businessmen are in the list of sanctions for dealing with ISIS.<br/>Bombing worked very well in Libya. It severely reduced the fighting capability of G. In Iraq it did the same with H. Combined with troops it worked well in A and in the counterinsurgency in Iraq. <br/>There are fighters on the ground.  Not enough but a start. Start is just that. People like Corbyn think that there is some clean solution, that war and peace can be negotiated into painless pleasing results. The reality is that almost never happens. If it did we wouldn't be in this mess.  <br/>Doing nothing means letting ISIS get stronger, grabbing a few more cities and then being even harder to dislodge. And they really dont change their view of us just because we bomb. Their goal is to kill and subjugate us. The West, particularly the Corbyn crowd, flagellates itself over the crusades w/o understanding anything beyond Richard the Lionhearted and Saladin. The jihad ("crusade") started in the 670s. It swept around to Spain, briefly reached Tours in France, took and pillaged southern Italy, raided the Med coast of France, Italy and the Balkans for centuries and twice reached the gates of Vienna, not to mention chunks of the Ukraine and the Crimea. It only ebbed when the Ottomans, the last caliphate, weakened. At no point did the jihad doctrine say we've got enough, you lot can live happily as ling as you dont bother us. Compared to that the crusades, barbaric though they were at times, were a garden tea party that lasted less than 200 years and were pretty ineffectual (a broader definition would throw in Prussia and the Balts, Iberia, North Africa and the Cathars but doesnt change the picture that much). Corbyn and co feel we have to apologize and bear the blame but in reality our crusades were a reaction not an unprovoked piece of imperialism.  ISIS is looking for a return match but with the conviction that this time the showdown is the opener for the apocalypse. Doing nothing just gives them more resources.</p>

<p>Read link about complexity of situation in Iraq and Syria.</p>

<p>Yup, it's complicated. That's what I have been saying. But the shock horror attempt to say the US is a loose canon looks like a damp squib. Who would you believe? The US or Russia and Putin? Especially as the Russians aren't using much in the way of smart bombs. Note that the Kurds couldn't have been successful w/o Nato air support.<br/>Is there a chance the wring people get hurt? Sure. Do you expect every military action to be 100% risk free? In which case just disarm because that will never happen. If you are going to bomb the oil installations inIraq but not in Syria why bother in the first place? Support the kurds in Iraq but leave them dangling in Syria? After all we all want a local proxy rather than seeing our own troops.<br/>Out of all the bad choices this seems the least bad. Bit like democracy.<br/>And to return to the original point it is a difficult enough decision to expect both leaders to avoid recriminations and threats -via deniable sources- to those who vote in favor. The country deserves an opposition leader who isn't in thrall to an organization like Stop the War - even Caroline Lucas who inhabits a small planet in a far away place, has had to leave them.</p>

<p>Cameron, vague?  Never...</p>

<p>Up until yesterday I thought Labour would retain Meacher's old seat in Oldham, albeit with a massively reduced majority. Today I think Corbyn doesn't much care. Why on earth couldn't he canvas there and still get back to sort his party problems this afternoon, Oldham's not in Australia? Plenty of us have to move around the country over such distances and we aren't chauffeur driven. If he's ever PM he'll have a lot more complex problems to deal with everyday. Why is he so determined to show everyone how feeble minded, lacking in energy and lazy he is?</p>

<p>It's being suggested he's sufficiently toxic that his presence there will make things worse.  Perhaps - as ever you have to ask who it is making that suggestion, but otherwise it is odd he hasn't gone there.</p>

<p>because he cant help it, he is feeble minded lacking in energy and lazy.</p>

<p>And has his priorities completely mixed up.</p>

<p>Blairite warmongers who have helped to destroy British democracy, near-bankrupted the nation through overspending, unleashed mass immigration from Islamic states,  and who still believe the iraq war was the "right thing to do", line up to tell us they hate Corbyn because he doesn't accept that bombing Syria will help. So predictable.</p>

<p>Just resign from the labour party and join Cameron. You warmongers have got a lot more in common with him.</p>

<p>The idiots who voted for Blair should realise they are too stupid for grown up society and never vote again</p>

<p>They're voting for Cameron now!</p>

<p>They are not, the ones screaming loudest are the ones who will vote for a pig with a red rosette, they and their supine members of parliament who cheered Blair until the day he retired are to blame for Blair, they treated him like a god.</p>

<p>Of course they are - or Cameron wouldn't have won the election.</p>

<p>cameron won on the collapse of the lib dems, Labour increased their vote in the last election.</p>

<p>So more people voted for Labour in the last election than before? Even with the collapse of Labour in Scotland and Wales? Really? Got a source for that?</p>

<p>2015: 9,347,304</p>

<p>2010: 8,606,517</p>

<p>It's partly explained by a slightly higher turnout, but they did also improve their share of the vote from 29% to 30.4%.  As said above, the collapse of the Lib Dems was the key.</p>

<p>Point taken on the last election, but we began by talking about voters for Blair - and in 2005 he got over 9.5 million votes.  And in 97 he got over 13 million votes.</p>

<p>Sure, I was merely providing a factual answer.  No subtext.</p>

<p>This is truly wonderful! I hope he leads the Labour Party for decades to come. nother could be better for our country.</p>

<p>Best 3 pounds I ever spent joining and voting for him - comedy gold every day</p>

<p>'Last week was nowhere close to the worst of Labour's history. This week has surpassed it in so many ways</p>

<p>Corbyn and his cronies are determined to fail – and to go on failing <br/>  every day until 2020'</p>

<p>Give it up Mr. McTernan, Labour and your precious socialism are krap and always have been, no argument, consider their record in Office, from 1945 onwards will do although 1997-2010 was surely their piece de resistance par excellence, it is just a matter of degrees.</p>

<p>From bright red to pale pink and every shade in between on the socialist scale, they were/are an ongoing catastrophe for the country as a whole, but not for them of course.</p>

<p>Labour politicos, their accolytes and placemen/women in state institutions, public sector management and the media, not forgetting trades unions bosses, rarely if ever suffer the consequences of their malevolent policies, gross incompetence and sometimes criminal irresponsibility.</p>

<p>Do they?</p>

<p>You say a lot without saying anything.</p>

<p>After Cameron's disastrous gung-ho intervention in Libya, one can't help but assume his judgement of military matters is suspect and his advice is best ignored.</p>

<p>"Not just evasion but deception. Not mere stupidity but malice. Not only misjudgement but the celebration of mass murderers."</p>

<p>And entirely unproven within this article.  John McTernan, an embarrassment to journalism.</p>

<p>'with that decision backed by the Labour whip.'</p>

<p>Is this the same whip implicated in the email sent to oppose the strikes?</p>

<p>Someone's telling porkies!</p>

<p>So Jeremy Corbyn and his closest allies – Diane Abbott, John McDonnell and Ken Livingstone..... says it all.</p>

<p>The dream team</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>I havnt slept since Abbott first appeared on This week.</p>

<p>Who here knows what ISIL stands for? The 'Islamic State Of Iraq The Levant'.<br/>The Levant comprises the nations bordering the eastern Med. Left unchecked Daesh wants to make the whole area it's Caliphate.</p>

<p>So whilst the Corbynistas endlessly contemplate and wait years for diplomacy to bare fruit, Daesh grows strong, conquers East and West Africa and the Levant, carries out terrorism in the west, slays Yazidi and other women, throws gay people off towers and makes the lives of millions of Muslims miserable.</p>

<p>Everyone who's ever read John Buchan and the other snobbery-with-violence school of literature knows what the Levant is. Their books are full of suspicious Levantine villains.</p>

<p>What's that you say, there's oil over there?  Well, we better start bombing right away...</p>

<p>Yawn</p>

<p>I know, bombing the natives is so tiresome, isn't it!</p>

<p>There's oil in Venezuela, are we bombing?<br/>Oil in Nigeria, are we bombing?<br/>You're not too bright, are you?</p>

<p>If UKIP take Oldham - which is a strong possibility - then he will have to go. Disaffected Labour voters switching to UKIP will kill Labour's chances in 2020 and they know it. He will be shown the door - the Labour Party will not commit collective suicide just to please 360,000 activists when there is an electorate to convince.</p>

<p>There is no chance that UKIP will win.</p>

<p>How much would you be prepared to wager on that assertion?</p>

<p>Happy to put up a lazy £1k.  What's your phone number, we can hook up on BetFair.</p>

<p>You go right ahead - the book is already open and you don't need me for it! I am not prepared to wager £1k, sorry!</p>

<p>Careful lad, blobby may be grooming you, hence the desire for a phone number.</p>

<p>Phew! Thanks for the tip!</p>

<p>Ah, a typical coward.</p>

<p>I have £50 on UKIP at 5/2 with Skybet.</p>

<p>If you think £1000 is a reasonable bet then I recommend gamble <a href="http://aware.co.uk" rel="nofollow">aware.co.uk</a>.</p>

<p>Alas I think Labour will hold. But even if they do, if their majority is slashed then alarm bells will start ringing at LP HQ. Any majority under 4000 would be a disaster for Labour. They will, of course tell us otherwise, but the truth of the matter is that this is a labour stronghold which they should hold with a double digit majority.</p>

<p>We won't know till Friday morning, by which time either I will be £125 richer and the political landscape will have suffered the equivalent of a force 8 earthquake, or that other fellow will be about £200 richer (if he bets £1000) and there may very well still have been something of a major tremor.</p>

<p>Still a few days to go. Jeremy Corbyn should focus on repairing the damage done these past two weeks if the Labour candidate - who is a very good candidate, btw - is to win what should have been a shoo-in.</p>

<p>I would love UKIP to take Oldham, but I think it is unlikely enough to refrain from betting on it.</p>

<p>If it looks close you can rely on everyone else to urge their supporters to vote tactically for Labour.</p>

<p>why?</p>

<p>Why what ?</p>

<p>why would anyone vote tactically for labour, more likely consevatives will vote tactically for UKIP.</p>

<p>Do you not recognise that it is in the interests of the Conservatives to have the lunatics on the other side of the house running the assylum?</p>

<p>some conservatives may think they can fire a shot over Camerons bows and get him to start being conservative.</p>

<p>What individuals do will vary, but what I am saying is that the other parties will at the last minute admit they can't win and try to engineer the vote to stop UKIP winning.</p>

<p>Also from conversations I have had over the last 6 months, it appears that a brainwashed proportion of the electorate sees UKIP as totally beyond the pale. I have been really surprised at who some of those people have been, I speak as I find, I wish it were different.</p>

<p>well labour are beyond the pale too, we will see.</p>

<p>Well of course, but to a lot of people see Labour like "Heinz" or "Cadburys" … a known brand …. whereas UKIP are like "Milka" ….. dangerously unknown.</p>

<p>In a by election they are not going to change the government,  it should be fun, just a few more gaffing days to go.</p>

<p>The Labour party may well be dead already, they were boasting this morning that they will win because they have the muslim vote.</p>

<p>Well of course they do. The dullard JC's friends in HAMAS and HEZBOLLAH will see to that.</p>

<p>Uptick if you are going to join McTernan in Cameron's "Dads Army" regiment when he decides he needs "boots on the ground".</p>

<p>Not many takers …. well, lets just leave it to the big boys of Russia and the US then.</p>

<p>Cost of signing up to Labour to vote for Corbyn - £3:</p>

<p>"Never in the field of political endeavour, has so much entertainment been had, by so many,for so little"</p>

<p>I know, it's brilliant isn't it?  I paid my three quid, voted for Corbyn, hoping he'd be useless, but he's been far far worse than that.  The only worry I have now so that he's so bad, not only is he making Cameron look good, which is a major achievement in itself, but Labour are now bound to replace him before 2020.  They might even elect somebody half competent,  I can't think of any names of the top of my head, but surely nobody could be this bad?</p>

<p>Who will replace Jeremy then ...</p>

<p>Chickenhead Chukka ?</p>

<p>Bonehead Burnham ?</p>

<p>Yukky Yvette ?</p>

<p>God … I just can't remember the names of the other Bliarite political pygmies, help me someone ….</p>

<p>Luciferous Liz.</p>

<p>I said three months ago that Mr Fatson will be the next Labour leader. Nothing that has happened since has changed my opinion.</p>

<p>Disagree - that will be akin to Brown replacing Blair and look how that played out. He even has the same bulk - Little &amp; Large.</p>

<p>Steady now. He will set the Chief Constable on you. Fatson like a little politically motivated criminal investigation or two. Oops, looks like I'll be getting a knock on the door as well.</p>

<p>I read that Blair wants to re-enter British politics, he thinks he would still make a great PM.</p>

<p>Might be a bit hard from The Hague!</p>

<p>hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahhahaha.......huuuularious</p>

<p>Liz Kendall looks dangerously normal. She might even be electable.  We should do all we can to keep Jeremy in play.</p>

<p>Normal?!?  Lol, she's more conservative than Cameron is.</p>

<p>To be fair, that's not very.</p>

<p>Which, lets be honest, isn't very difficult to pull off; considering Cameron is hardly a Conservative.</p>

<p>Asset selling, war mongering, continual influx of cheap labour to keep profits up...not sure how he could get more typical a Conservative?</p>

<p>She sounds nice too, I just cant remember a word she says.</p>

<p>She looks like how I imagine Susan Carter from "The Archers".</p>

<p>"Oh, Neeeoooo…."</p>

<p>Just too housewifey and out of her depth. They won't want another "joke" leader. But then again …. when the cupboard is bare ...</p>

<p>Thanks goodness the dullard JC doesn't look out of his depth.</p>

<p>Mr Extremely Blairite would replace Corbyn of course.</p>

<p>Yes …. fine but who in flesh &amp; blood terms ?</p>

<p>Baron Tristram Hunt?</p>

<p>Nope … "Tristram" ==&gt; Toff. Loses the white working class vote immediately as well as Scotland. Try again…..</p>

<p>We could market this as an Xmas party game…. you have to get the most useless candidates for PM past a huge array of media tank traps ….. just need a name for the game … "BLIAR" ?</p>

<p>You want to talk about failure McTernan? Talk about the time you were a special advisor in the heart of New Labour and managed to blow a 10-15% lead when Brown took office to lose the 2010 election. Talk about the time you were Julia Gillard’s Chief of Staff when she lost the Australian Premiership because her party lost confidence. Or how about when you were Jim Murphy’s Chief of Staff and he was claiming to be “astonished at how easy he has found it to take on SNP”, only to lose over 95% of your party’s seats to them 4 months later.<br/>McTernan is an expert in dodgy dealings and backstabbing but he’s certainly not an expert on politics.</p>

<p>Nice one..</p>

<p>Mrs Duffy saw off Brown, bless her.</p>

<p>I don't know Mrs. Duffy personally, but if it is true she still voted Labour, and still does, then this illustrates how difficult it is for new parties with new ideas to put British people first. To put up with what Brown said and then still vote for Labour defies any logic.</p>

<p>I know that type of community, we have secret ballots, my mother would never say she voted for anyone but Labour.</p>

<p>Is Corbyn any better?</p>

<p>Brown was an electoral disaster before he became PM, he was a fiscal disaster and could not temper his sarcasm when referring to a voter who asked an embarrassing question.</p>

<p>Gilliard was simply too abrasive, and had only a minority government, living on the support of the eco-fascists Greens more concerned with green matters than the jobs of Australians.</p>

<p>As for anyting to do with the SNP, Labour simply lost the plot in Scotland  - the SNP caught peoples attention because its issues were those of Scotland.</p>

<p>Obviously you are also no great shakes as a political commentator.</p>

<p>The Telegraph's 'resident Labour experts' are in John McTernan someone who was responsible for an embarrassing, humiliating election result of historic proportions and Dan Hodges, who is so confused that he recently claimed that David Cameron was now the new leader of the British left.</p>

<p>And we should listen to them because...?</p>

<p>Hodges is right about Cameron though.</p>

<p>I hate to say it but I agree with Corbyn, but our reasons I suspect are diametrically opposed.</p>

<p>Why on earth get involved in a war where both sides hate and distrust us, what on earth can be the outcome. Cameron's reasoning and so called "plan" for Syria after the destruction of ISIS I suspect was written by a fourth former with no understanding of the hell hole that is the middle east. Has he not been paying attention to the results of our last bombing trips. What does he think 4 clapped out Tornadoes are going to change. It is very much like his requests for change in the EU. Facile.</p>

<p>So  there is no sensible outgame for us, even Camoron himself says we may be there 10 years, by which time he, like Blair will be raking it in while our young men and women are being killed and maimed for one mans arrogance.</p>

<p>Corbyn agrees with me, but his reasons are because he would rather see a blood soaked Islamist rule the world than stand up for the UK which he seems to despise, though it doesn't stop him being paid by the institutions he so obviously hates.</p>

<p>Doing nothing leaves Isil to consolidate what it holds in Iraq and Syria, to continue to threaten the Kurds and to press on with the conquest of Damascus and the capture of Syria's Mediterranean coast. It will give the jihadis freedom to expand further into Iraq and endanger Jordan and Lebanon. Doing nothing is not an option because the threat will only grow until dealing with it becomes an existential necessity.</p>

<p>Valid points but there are more than enough people bombing each other in that area. Russia, US, France, Turkey, Syrian pro and anti Assad, Iran for example. What do we need to use our 4 Tornadoes to bomb an already overbombed area.</p>

<p>ISIS as a cause will wither and die in these circumstances I feel anyway and their occupation of areas will not last because their is no infrastructure they deal in death. That cannot sustain a "country" "Caliphate" whatever.</p>

<p>Those other Arab countries are the ones who should stand and fight, the "West" will not be thanked for these interventions.</p>

<p>Cameron and the rest of the idiots in the commons would be far better ensuring those that support ISIS and it's many forms are removed from the UK asap.</p>

<p>You sound like a typical colonialist.</p>

<p>Leave it to the Ruskis, Yanks &amp; you Frogs.</p>

<p>You folded early in 1940… you owe us big time for digging you out of the merde twice in less than 30 years.</p>

<p>Excellent.</p>

<p>"...it doesn't stop him being paid by the institutions he so obviously hates.", could say the same about Farage?</p>

<p>Why mention Farage?</p>

<p>I was merely wondering if the outrage over a politician taking a salary from the EU extended to his holy "not-racist"-ness</p>

<p>I strongly suspect he opposes the war because of the inevitable killings of innocent people.</p>

<p>This civil war is none of our business.</p>

<p>...and in doing so is happy to accept the continued killings of innocent people such as those in Tunisia and Paris</p>

<p>Of course, a couple of bombs on ISIS in Syria would end that all in a flash.</p>

<p>Yawn. Camerons 7 point plan is long term and far reaching, but keep regurgitating the mindless sound bites.<br/>Another armchair expert that knows more about the military hardware required than  do the allied Generals</p>

<p>.....of course not so lets just mind our own business and accept that every few months another bunch of brits will get murdered</p>

<p>These left wingers ignore the fact British people are being killed by these terrorists.</p>

<p>It just shows the mindset of a Liberal, to them a British person's life is worth nothing compared to some poor brown skinned person who they can pretend to give a s*** about.</p>

<p>He strongly opposes WAR, he is a Pacifist. The only trouble he has not come up with a viable alternative.</p>

<p>PACIFIST?</p>

<p>He supports the IRA, he supports the Palestinian terrorists, he supported the East German regime that murdered people trying to leave its borders.</p>

<p>Remind me - how many photos of Kim Jung Fatone of North Korea and of Stalin and of paedophile Che Guevera and Fidel Castro does he have on his office wall?</p>

<p>And does he think the war will therefore end if the UK does not send its Sopwith Camel over armed with a few Mills Bombs? If he genuinely wants to Stop the War then he needs to help ensure it is resolved as quickly as possible. And that is either going to mean a Daesh victory with all that entails for the multi-cultural west or a Western victory which will take a little bit longer because we refused to fight a belief system that the vast majority of us find repulsive.</p>

<p>The war in Syria is not civil.</p>

<p>Providing moral support to the US and France isn't a good enough reason for the UK to go to war.</p>

<p>But David Haines, Allan Henning and the 29 Brits killed in Tunisia is</p>

<p>Yes we should just give them moral support.</p>

<p>(Like they did in 1940, when the balance of power against us was far less favourable.)</p>

<p>The longer this goes on the better.</p>

<p>As every day of this living fiasco goes passes more Labour voters will see what the Labour party really are and why they no longer stand for the rights of British workers and the interests of the British people.</p>

<p>Bombing foreigners in a foreign country IS in the 'interests of British people' is it?</p>

<p>Of course not.</p>

<p>My worry is that Jeremy will resign.The laughs and joy he is spreading across the nation..They have all gone...Benny Hill.Les Dawson,Tommy Cooper.Only Jeremy and Ken Dodd left .</p>

<p>Dont panic! Tory party members will rally around qnd fork out the £3 necessary to elect Dianne Abbott to replace him</p>

<p>You have really upset Bruce Forsyth now</p>

<p>Whether we bomb or not we've got a hundred years (or longer) war to come.  We need to be taking hard decisions about securing our homeland.  Think Charlton Heston with a lance.</p>

<p>Absolutely correct: this is all out war for at least a hundred years.</p>

<p>But first we must clean up the UK - ban islam, close all mosques and repatriate all those who follow a cult out to destroy us.</p>

<p>Think Charlton Heston and NRA.</p>

<p>John McTernan....the person who as campaign manager oversaw the total annihilation of Labour in Scotland talking about the 'worst Labour week' !!!!<br/>You couldn't make it up ! <br/>Nice to see McTernan and Hodges playing the Telegraph lickspittles role to perfection !</p>

<p>Yes, you know the Tories have had a bad week when they bring out the NuLab tag team.</p>

<p>In <a>Jeremy Corbyn told to resign by Labour MPs as Syria vote engulfs his leadership</a> I ask myself what Corbyn did next? The facts are there for all to see: </p>

<p> by means of a hastily scrawled letter to his party; this  left him free for another bout of self-indulgent, Saturday posturing.</p>

<p>Time for retro Leicester pop group Jihadiwaddy to play   a benefit gig</p>

<p>One step to heaven?</p>

<p>They're a blast</p>

<p>All they're missing for the full set is Derek Hatton.</p>

<p>Degsy is now a property developer living in Cyprus.<br/>O tempora. O mores!</p>

<p>And still spouting his hypocritical Marxist rubbish.</p>

<p>The Capitalist swine</p>

<p>Let's drop some high explosives onto the Middle East because it's worked brilliantly so far.</p>

<p>Corbyn may be farting into the winds of war, but is right about the futility of the next disastrous episode which can only make things worse. Present policy makes the progression of WWT(terrorism) to WW3 all but inevitable.</p>

<p>Every regional player has different motives, there is no trust - only hate, there is no political, diplomatic, military or religious solution and there will never will be. Fighting will stop when all the combatants are either dead, nearly dead or bankrupt</p>

<p>My solution is to build a 40 foot concrete wall around the region, banish our enemies to the wrong side of it and leave them to get on with it.</p>

<p>Oh if only Australia were still available! :P</p>

<p>I am glad you know the solution to all this and can I request you go and let the top minds supplied by the UK, USA, EU (rest of) and Russia that you have identified the clear way of resolving this once and for all.</p>

<p>I am actually starting to feel a bit sorry for Corbyn and his team. They are so obviously out of their depth it might actually be more sporting for Cameron to send round some Tory advisors to help Labour get back on track.</p>

<p>Labour has its own Tory advisors. This article was written by one of them.</p>

<p>The Conservatives will need all the advisors they can get when the civil war breaks on Cameron's retirement.</p>

<p>Never fear Captain Osborne is here and with a bit of creative accounting he'll save the day.</p>

<p>He won't end up as leader.</p>

<p>Actually I think Corbyn is broadly right about bombing ISIS. It will not make us safer - quite the reverse in fact - and it is appalling that Cameron makes this claim.</p>

<p>However, we all know that if Corbyn were in power, not only would Jihadi John be alive, he would be Home Secretary.</p>

<p>There would never have been a Jihadi John in the first place.</p>

<p>since Labour undertook to reconfigure the country's demographics with total disregard for the consequences save their own electoral advantage, my only worry at this point is that the decent into oblivion of this rotten electoral gang be as painful and as ghastly as possible. with no survivors. and with a bloody cherry on top.</p>

<p>nailed it</p>

<p>Corbyn probably grieves over the fact that in 1940 lord Halifax didn't become Prime Minister instead of Churchill.   I have just watched (a recording of) the Channel 4 broadcast earlier about Muslim women in Britain who support ISIS. An extremely chilling documentary.  Corbyn is obviously clueless about what we are up against.</p>

<p>And the Tories? 5 1/2 years in power and they continue to oversee mass immigration numbers that surpass what Tony Blair managed.</p>

<p>i refer you to my post from an hour ago: "in which destiny the so-called Conservatives should properly join them"</p>

<p>I couldn't agree more, if a trial for treason followed by summary execution cannot be arranged for these traitors then a figurative Crucifixion at the polls will have to do.</p>

<p>in which destiny the so-called Conservatives should properly join them</p>

<p>Perhaps pontius pilate like we should hand their fates over to their friends....</p>

<p>The Guardian came out fully in support of Corbyn today in a lead editorial that was shameful as it was shallow and grossly bigoted.</p>

<p>The G and the BBC are being unmasked as the proponants of the extreme left.</p>

<p>what's interesting at the G is that the comments btl are now in very marked contrast to the tone of the articles themselves</p>

<p>A comment here and a quote there is disaster? You need to man up.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if Corbyn, who has voted against his party hundreds of times on the basis of his apparent conscience, now allows his MPs to do the same with a free vote.</p>

<p>Surely he'll just vote against himself to maintain his track record of dissent.</p>

<p>lol.....</p>

<p>you are a Trotskyist saboteur and you will be reported to the Ministry of Love</p>

<p>My dream job is a civil servant in the Ministry of Love.</p>

<p>In the department of sweet whoopee and eternal bliss.</p>

<p>I would even be prepared to work overtime!</p>

<p>I'm told the entrance exam is a tricky one to master</p>

<p>Not too hard.<br/>But you need a pair of stout boots.</p>

<p>absolutely, the North face of the Abbott is a very demanding route</p>

<p>And the south face is unthinkable.</p>

<p>Good luck with that.<br/>Most of the posters here are clerks in the Ministry of Truth.</p>

<p>I suspect it will be a case of "do as I say not as I do"</p>

<p>The Labour Party was never a 'pacifist' party and neither were its supporters.</p>

<p>There were certainly pacifists in the party but they were always a minority.</p>

<p>What is disturbing about the current crop is that they have a very dubious record as pacifists. Livingstone has come out in praise of the 7/7 bombers in London on the grounds that they were protesting against Blair's invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>He, as well as Corby and others admire groups like Hamas, Hezzbola and the IRA none of which is pacifist and they all glorify violence and their own part in it. Which leads to a certain confusion as to what the Labour Party actually is these days.</p>

<p>Perhaps I may remind Corby what his friends got up to and how their actions have echoes through the years.</p>

<p>In 1973 Thomas Niedermayer, managing director of Grundig in Northern Ireland and honoury consul for Northern Ireland was kidnapped and murdered by the IRA.</p>

<p>His body was only found and buried in 1980.</p>

<p>His wife returned to Northern Ireland ten years later and committed suicide.</p>

<p>His two daughters, one of whom witnessed her father being kidnapped, committed suicide ten years after that.</p>

<p>One family wiped out by friends of Jeremy Corbyn and he dares to claim the moral high ground.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Niedermayer" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p>

<p>He is a charlatan of the first order.</p>

<p>"Livingstone has come out in praise of the 7/7 bombers in London on the grounds that they were protesting against Blair's invasion of Iraq."</p>

<p>What he actually said was:</p>

<p>"When Tony Blair was told by the security services, 'If you go into Iraq, we will be a target for terrorism', and he ignored that advice, and it killed 52 Londoners."</p>

<p>How is that different from the American defence secretary saying in response to Russia's intervention in Syria: “This will have consequences for Russia itself, which is rightly fearful of attacks. In coming days, the Russians will begin to suffer from casualties.” ?</p>

<p>What has that got to do with the subject under discussion?</p>

<p>‘They gave their lives, they said what they believed. They took Londoners’ lives in protest at our invasion of Iraq.’</p>

<p>Any problem with that? Straight from the horse's mouth.</p>

<p>Using the word 'protest' was clearly wrong, but the terrorists clearly said in the videos released after the bombings that it was because of the UK's invasion of Iraq.</p>

<p>Saying they did it "because they hate our way of life" or "because they hate our freedom" might be comforting for some, but it is living in denial.</p>

<p>"the terrorists clearly said"...<br/>:-)<br/>You're trolling, right? Not even a socialist could be that naïve.</p>

<p>"Video of 7/7 ringleader blames foreign policy"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/sep/02/alqaida.politics" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/uk/...</a></p>

<p>I don't like Livingstone and what he said was unwise BUT to twist it into something that praises the terrorists is completely disingenuous and untrue.</p>

<p>People like you think they are doing harm to the likes of Livingstone whereas in fact you are doing quite the opposite. Tell it as it is or don't tell at all.</p>

<p>Very precise summary. Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm quoting what he said. If you don't like it tell him to shut his mouth or start talking sense. It's his quote not mine.</p>

<p>Can you see the little tadpoles? They are called quotation marks.</p>

<p>Exactly.  I couldn't believe that he actually said it, but you're right - he did. Disgusting.</p>

<p>No you are twisting the facts.</p>

<p>Livingstone is too but he did not praise the terrorists. He may secretly like them, but he is not stupid enough to praise them.</p>

<p>Selective misquoting is a favourite weapon.</p>

<p>More 7/7s are inevitable if Cameron bombs Syria. Then the recriminations will begin, just as they did with Bliar.</p>

<p>That is such a red herring. They are likely to do it anyway when they don't get their way on something … like having the UK taxpayer fund re-orientating  their khazis away from Mecca, a minor insult from a Championship Football manager, anything really.</p>

<p>The point is why is Cameron getting involved in Syria when we could just leave it to Putin to obliterate these scum ? We owe the Russians nothing, they were happy to team up with Hitler until he turned on them, if we hadn't supported them 1941-45 they would literally be gone.</p>

<p>So your position is to do nothing about ISIL for fear that they will enact 'recriminations' against us.  Meanwhile, we should close our eyes to the terror and slaughter they commit in Iraq and Syria because it makes you feel 'safer' if we don't confront them.  There is another aspect to the problem - the 'home grown' supporters who have returned from the killing fields of Syria, trained and ready to commit acts of terror on our streets.  Do you really believe that these jihadis will turn away from extremism just because Blighty doesn't bomb Syria?</p>

<p>You can see my views in my discussion with RevCR</p>

<p>I can see your views on the used side of a sheet of bog roll.</p>

<p>Lol. I see you are incapable of discussion. You think because you happen to represent the majority (largely brainwashed by propaganda) viewpoint, that any dissenting voice must be attacked. As such, you are just another indoctrinated drone</p>

<p>And what did Spain do to deserve the Madrid bombings? The whole of the West is a target and the terrorists are no more discriminating than we are between Sunni, Shiite, Saudi, Iranian, Afghan and Syrian.</p>

<p>"And what did Spain do to deserve the Madrid bombings?"</p>

<p>They didn't deserve it, but the attack was motivated by Spain's contribution to the Western forces occupying Iraq. That is from the bombers themselves.</p>

<p>In other words, they were motivated merely by the fact that Spain was western. No other justification was needed. We cannot hide from this fight. And if we really desire peace we are going to have to fight for it.</p>

<p>Ireland wasn't attacked and Luxembourg wasn't attacked and they're Western. Oddly Spain and Britain happened to be attacked and both had troops occupying Iraq.</p>

<p>Explain how the Yazidis come into your equation of revenge.</p>

<p>ISIS are a fascistic, supremacist death cult that is the product of Western meddling in Iraq and Syria. I can't fathom the motives of such creatures.</p>

<p>ISIL is its own creator, it has nothing to do with the west. The plan is decades old.</p>

<p>The fact that they are not attacked yet does not mean they might be. As far as I am aware neither India nor Kenya have put any support into occupying Iraq but both have been targeted.</p>

<p>The attacks in India are related to Kashmir and the attacks in Kenya are related to its occupation of Somalia.</p>

<p>So we have identified that there are more than one reason why Islamist terrorists lash out. We have also identified that you do not need to be actually doing very much in the middle east to be considered a target. We have also established that countries with a higher local Islamic population will have a greater threat of native terrorism. And you still think we can stand by and pretend none of this affects us?</p>

<p>Exactly. The fight will be in Iraq, Syria and most importantly, here at home in Europe.</p>

<p>Apologist for terrorism.</p>

<p>Apologist for illegal wars.</p>

<p>There are always people here who are apologists for the terrorists.<br/>It's the West's fault as far as they're concerned.</p>

<p>And who do you suppose caused all this mess in the first place ? Bush and his lackey Bliar. But that  was probably before you were even born, so no wonder you dont remember</p>

<p>If my memory serves me correctly, 9/11 preceded any action by Bush and Blair.</p>

<p>Bush attacked Iraq in 1991.</p>

<p>Wrong on so many levels.  I suspect you are 'educated' via the internet and lap up the propaganda that is pumped out to inflame simple minds.</p>

<p>Didnt Iraq invade Kuwait in 1990. Bush Snr stopped at the border after the aggressor had been evicted. <br/>Are you really saying that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait was OK?</p>

<p>No, I'm saying the devastating attack on Iraq and the collective punishment of the Iraqi people following the war was not okay.</p>

<p>But you just said that all this was brought about by the 1991 attack on Iraq. But didn't that happen in defence of Kuwait. Iraq did not get invaded then. It sounds as if you condoning the invasion of Kuwait and that Iraq has every right to feel aggrieved because they were thrown out of Kuwait.</p>

<p>Iraq wasn't invaded in 1991, but thousands of its people were killed, its infrastructure destroyed and the population collectively punished by sanctions for the actions of its dictator following the war.</p>

<p>It is known America deliberately obstructed efforts to resolve the Kuwait crisis peacefully.</p>

<p>Your first para is correct. When one country invades another it is classed as declaring war. Unfortunately in many cases it is the civilian population that suffers whilst the actual instigator walks free. Degrading infrastructure is quite legitimate in war.</p>

<p>I should have added that an illegal act (invasion) does require some payback. It is only a shame that we are unable to hold Mr Blair to account for his actions.</p>

<p>I thought we had held the politician responsible for the illegal war to account. Saddam was hanged.</p>

<p>Depends whether you consider the invasion of Iraq to be legal. If it was not it still does not justify "home grown" terrorists, who take the principle of religion above that of the country that nurtured them.</p>

<p>If you mean the 2nd Iraq War then it is a wee bit late to still be banging on about it. I suspect the Zulu War was probably illegal but so what?<br/>I agree that any group that puts their religion above the laws of state they living in are, at best, living in the wrong state, and at worst liable to be banged up or killed for proactively spreading their views.<br/>Sadly religion knows no man made border and neither should our ability to fight religious extemists wherever they appear.</p>

<p>I was replying to the fact that a politician was held to account, I believe that not all. But Chilcot will settle that (I do not hold my breath) In all other respects totally agree.</p>

<p>No one forced Saddam to invade Kuwait. Or Iran in the early 80s. Or to gas the Kurds.</p>

<p>Yes I agree, he was one of a number of politicians who acted  wrongly. <br/>Blair has now admitted that his purpose in invading Iraq was regime change. Under the UN charter that is illegal.</p>

<p>But no one has mourned Saddam's passing. Illegal or not the world is a better place for him not being around.</p>

<p>Please discuss! But not here and now too long a discussion.</p>

<p>Definitely one for the pub and a few cold glasses of cider</p>
