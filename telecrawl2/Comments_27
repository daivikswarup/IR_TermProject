<p>I see Farage is back ...hoping to get some recruits. He left it too late to get  a seat before the Election , missed a big chance to strengthen UKIP . <br/>Corbyn is to give a Free Vote on the Airstrike .</p>

<p>So, as he made his career, he was perfectly suited to cnt'stable" üëÜ</p>

<p>It's amazing that even after we've had it proven what stupidity it was to get involved in Iraq, there is some doubt in the minds of some the population that this is just war serving US military corporations and neoconservaticve psychopaths, nothing else.</p>

<p>Did the airstrikes by the RAF in Iraq stop theParis atrocity?</p>

<p>We need a full spectrum assualt on Daesh and that includes dealing with those countries and individuals that supply cash and arms to the terrorists.</p>

<p>Why is the British Government so silent about this?</p>

<p>Because we are one of the countries supplying them with arms.</p>

<p>Surely not!</p>

<p>see how silent the righties are on this? 13 hrs and not one comment.</p>

<p>Cameron bothers me...he is quite happy to send our troops into battle in Syria knowing what a disaster that will be. He seems to act on everything Hollande says even though Hollande did nothing to help the Containers and their Drivers. in the Tunnel in Calais.. I don't trust him at all and Cameron wants to get in on the act, he has a big ego but I hope other Conservatives will try to stop him .</p>

<p>He's not. He's Irish, an ex Met copper and army person who is retired and lives in Brussels conducting military tours across the battlefields of Flanders. I know much much more about him but it's really not worth knowing. </p>

<p>i'm getting to you aren't I dear, you got the mods to lift my comments about you boasting how you batted against the top bowlers and how you knew Botham and Holding when all it you had was a pic of you getting an autograph from them. You little house of bragging cards is starting to topple Bazzine</p>

<p>oh Bazza sending out contact message in Arabic. Is there no end to you bizarre tastes. Come on tell us what you said. Let me think "Aging home counties old buffer with botox and eye enhancement seeks young Middle Eastern man for game of French Cricket. Dress optional"</p>

<p>He said: "Aseel may find you and cut off your head"</p>

<p>thank God for that, I thought it was an invite to see his proctologist</p>

<p>Bazza, you know so much cos its out there on the internet. I have nothing to hide. Like you I am to be found on google. </p>

<p>Lhhhh, ignore Mohan. He's like a fart. A brief smell which soon goes away unremembered. </p>

<p>that made about as much sense as the rest of your bollix mate. What have the Canucks got to do with you.</p>

<p>And yet the majority of the electorate agree with Corbyn's stance on bombing Syria. So in effect the real story here is: undemocratic Labour MPs malign the leadership and ignore the will of the people for their own selfish ends.</p>

<p>How contrived,  scripted and timely is Francois Holland's declaration of war in Syria on Assad, you would almost think the whole thing was a show.</p>

<p>Iv'e heard it all now. The Indian Restaurants are asking for Indian chefs to be allowef in  because there is a shortage and some Restaurants are closing down because they cant get experienced chefs. !!!! We have had Indian Restaurants for years in Britain , isn't it the job of the owner to train their staff. ???</p>

<p>They constantly need new immigrants because the pay and conditions are too poor to attract Indians born here</p>

<p>Hi Allyup, well the cost of an Indian Meal is not that cheap so the Owners must be greedy. I'm just reminded of the Comedy Programme on BBC2  about an Indian Family  a long time ago  very funny .</p>

<p>What a melting pot we have created!! Are you good at finding stuff Allyup? I ask because I seem to remember the Departing English Guy gave Pakistan Dual citizenship . Since these Indian Restaurants have to ask for Indian Chef to be allowed into Britain , it MUST have been the Pakistans who were granted dual citizenship , much smaller Country anyway.</p>

<p>Never thought of that Allyup, the thing is, if they are illegals they have to accept the situation. A few months ago the Council was updating information on how many illegals there might be and a House very near me had 13 Men listed at one address which is a 3 bedroom House. !!!!! They have to have an address to claim benefits . I remember reading that strawberry pickers who come over from France have given up because the British Farmer could not compete with the Spanish import for price so could no longer pay their travel costs. We are living in crazy times Allyup</p>

<p>"There is ‚Äúno limit‚Äù on the number of Indian nationals who can come to Britain to study and work, David Cameron has said. "<br/> <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/9868821/Immigration-David-Cameron-urgesIndians-to-come-to-welcoming-Britain.html#disqus_thread" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a>  -David-Cameron-urges-Indians-to-come-to-welcoming-Britain.html#disqus_thread<br/>.<br/>KEEP UP</p>

<p>Thanks Oinker cameron , I tried to find on Wikipedia the evidence that it was Pakistan not India that was given dual citizenship , no joy .  Cameron has engaged topclass Lawyers apparently to read through the Treaty , but it looks as though Merkel et al are not going to let Britain leave easily, why would they when we are one of the strongest Partners solvent, willing to lend E1 million without a repayment date . looking even longer now that Merkel has just given E3 million  to Turkey for their help . I think that because the migrant situation is now out of hand all borders should be closed until the existing migrants have been checked out. Climate change is the important issue today.  Thousands of marchers in Britain are marching in an orderly fashion about Climate change, in France the same topic is is being held and tear gas etc already  being used tagainst protesters.</p>

<p>It's the Pakistanis who were given dual citizenship I think. <br/>Breaking News....the EU is to give E3 Million to Turkey  to help with their immigrant influx. Turkey is also involved in action  in Syria . I holidayed in Turkey a few years  ago and young Bar Staff working on the Beach Bar told us that they wanted to come to Britain to study but their Government would not issue Visas for them.</p>

<p>Thanks Oinker cameron , I have been trying to find the information about Pakistanis given dual Citizenship , no joy. This  did not apply to India. With all due respect , can't the Restaurant Owners <br/>train chefs themselves? <br/>Nigel Farage is back on the scene, being interviewed by Murnaghan , reminding us that jihadists are on the way to Britain. ," It's just another manic Monday ", who used to sing that? LOL</p>

<p>The Bangles.</p>

<p>Bangles like you wear for you nights out with the boys, I bet you don't know which way to turn at times</p>

<p>That's it The Bangles.....thanks. ....I can hear it being sung now. LOL<br/>Rumour has it that Corbyn will go for the free vote but remain anti himself What .if the Lib Dems SNP vote against , would that affect the result?<br/>Farage is looking to the Conservatives to include UKIP MPs,vote  what , all two votes.....??? He really is a plonker. !!..</p>

<p>Its seems that Corbyn's views on Syria are helping to swell the UKIP vote in Oldham with the original 34% difference down to 7% this weekend. <br/>Assuming Labour still win Oldham but with a much reduced majority in what was a former "safe" seat then there are implications for the future as UKIP came second behind Labour is 120 seats in 2015.<br/>Corbyn and his far left cohorts have only just got started with their far left policies. What will the public reaction be after 4+ more years of fruit cake policies?</p>

<p>But they are not far left policies.  They are just presented as such by the rightwing press.</p>

<p>Do you think it was right for labour to oppose Tax Credits?  Was that a 'far left' stance?  Or was it opposition to lunacy?</p>

<p>They are are far left policies.Labour will be trashed in 2020.</p>

<p>If a rightie saw someone throwing a coin in a charity Wishing Well that would be 'far left' Marxism to them.</p>

<p>Ha ha spot on - apparently Allyup et al would have us believe that to care about things other than ourselves is now far left</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>too long</p>

<p>now that is something I bet you have never heard from a female </p>

<p>A study by the United Nations Children‚Äôs Fund, Unicef, found that between 1991 and 1998, the height of the blockade, there were 500,000 ‚Äúexcess‚Äù deaths of Iraqi infants under the age of five. An American TV reporter put this to Madeleine Albright, US Ambassador to the United Nations, asking her, ‚ÄúIs the price worth it?‚Äù Albright replied, ‚ÄúWe think the price is worth it.‚Äù</p>

<p>and then they wonder why 9/11 happened</p>

<p>tell us, why did it happen Porky</p>

<p>'Hearts and Minds'  that is what is missing in this debate.</p>

<p>you mind went west a long time ago, as for your heart, well that is as weak as cats pee. Seeing how you are so scared of big bad Jihadis. Don't worry they don't go after those living in low rent tenements. Plus you will be as safe as houses at work in the underground gents. I know it can be a pain in the rectum down there but you will be ok. </p>

<p>You seem to be trying to troll again.</p>

<p>a troll is some kind of Nordic mythical creature. So what does trolling mean. Anyway you are just one of those whinging bottleless punters. Like I said before you are never going to be asked to defend your country and even if asked you would probably find some excuse to get out of it. So you will be able to watch the bombing from next week from the safety of your front room. Just you and the cats</p>

<p>Keep trying.  This is hardly going to bother me is it.  I find it amusing, I promise you.</p>

<p>so you find being a moral and physical coward amusing, strange or what</p>

<p>Hardly an argument but rather typical.</p>

<p>You must remember the day after the German's surrendered,the Americans started'rearming'West Germany,it's always been about military sales</p>

<p>which comic did you read that in Lee, the handbook for half wits. Germany wasn't rearmed until the early 50's. It was in no shape to be rearmed after surrender.  You should stick to reading comics, history isn't your strongest suit is it</p>

<p>A quick way to create extremists in the East, isn't it.</p>

<p>I have always called her 'Notbright'.</p>

<p>Now that France has said it will join Assad's forces fighting Isil,what is Dave's response as France is leading the EU forces already there?</p>

<p>There are no EU forces fighting in Syria Lee. Time for you to start paying attention to whats happening in the world. Watching too much Big Brother is bad for you.</p>

<p>My enemy's friend's mate's enemy, is now my enemy's friend's aunt's friend's enemy. Until I change my mind.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>And you think the Tories appear to be doing well with their scandals, U-Turns, inability to understand that cuts mean cuts and the trashing of our military and intelligence services just before a 'Holy War'...</p>

<p>That appears to be a sign of incompetence.</p>

<p>It is noted that a straw-stuffed suit is your optimum political leader.</p>

<p>Hollande should keep his plonker out of British politics and save that for the unfortunate women he has ensnared into his life.</p>

<p>He certainly has something for such a stunted character, physically and politically.</p>

<p>Anybody got any clues, or is it just female lust for someone in a position of power?</p>

<p>You know, at some point all those building being bombed in Syria are going to have to be rebuilt by someone, and it is not going to be cheap.</p>

<p>earlier in this war.. if you look beyond the fighting.. in the back ground at syrias flats and houses, syria rally didn't look a bad place to live... The same went for Libya..</p>

<p>No one cares  about that sort of thing.</p>

<p>However, it might be a good way to give international aid to 'selected' British companies to 'help' in the rebuilding process.</p>

<p>FIngers crossed... Large population of Labours core voters up there tho?!</p>

<p>Lots of "ethnic" voters though, and the postal votes will already have been organised and stacked up.</p>

<p>The Government have changed the voting rules recently. I hope it helps stamping out the obvious vote rigging that takes place in the postal votes.</p>

<p>Oh, have they...  Do you have a link NYM - i would like to take a look?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34621004" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-p...</a></p>

<p>And you will never guess which party protested against these changes?!</p>

<p>No, we couldn't possibly, any more than which section of the Great Enrichment will be most affected!</p>

<p>What if we do commit air strikes, then kill some Turkmen, who want rid of not only I.S but the Syrian Army, who I think make up some of the 70,000 Dave claims will finish the job.<br/>Or is that the Free Syrian Army?<br/>And when they do 'free Syria' what spring up next?</p>

<p>We need to go after those that are supplying funding for Daesh and are buying their oil.</p>

<p>However, the righties seem strangely silent on this.  They would rather waste taxpayers money on airstrikes.</p>

<p>I have actually been reading up on some of this, taking in what I can, all the right wing blowhards don't seem to have a clue about any of it.<br/>Just end up slagging off your avatar or ask you if you've been drinking.<br/>They rarely do opinions.<br/>Quite an emotionally immature place to be.</p>

<p>I think it is a medical condition.</p>

<p>should have worn a condom then, shouldn't you</p>

<p>You are well on form tonight willie</p>

<p>one tries Josh, but really old  Seax is fish in a barrel is he not, and with that I must hit the rack, Josh, night and keep safe. . Oh and Seax I miss you already, like a urinary tract infection.</p>

<p>For purile and pointess comments?  You seem easily amused.</p>

<p>not as amused as your folks where when told you were being kept in for further treatment</p>

<p>What would be a nice gesture of solidarity is if those suppliers of missiles for our airstrikes gave them to us for free.  To show how the private sector supports the protection of the free world's people.</p>

<p>Do you think that will happen?</p>

<p>And why not?<br/>The free market is the saviour of the world after all, our lives would be much worse off without its glorious system or rather lack of.</p>

<p>I have to agree.  You would think they would be bending over backwards to support the suppression of terrorism by giving us what we need for free.</p>

<p>Or do they want to profit from our fear of death?  I wonder.</p>

<p>bending over backwards, we don't wish to hear about your nocturnal habits</p>

<p>There's always an angle, I'll give them that.<br/>C'mon you right wingers tell us where our lack of understanding of the free market is falling short here.</p>

<p>It seems they want a small State unless it is to defend them from harm.</p>

<p>Surely the free market will save us from Terrorists.</p>

<p>Yes, put our national security out to tender as well as everything else, why should us taxpayers pay for it?</p>

<p>Wait a minute: The Tories will probably ask the Communists to take on the role of protecting us.</p>

<p>They like outsourcing to the Chinese.</p>

<p>David Camaoron?</p>

<p>The term 'government mandarin' will never be the same again.</p>

<p>Well clearly he personally does not know what to do so lets hope that Meacher's Constituents and UKIP can give him a clue</p>

<p>What not to do is what the Tories have <i>actually </i>done: Massively cut the Armed Services, Intelligence Services and Border Forces.</p>

<p>Then look all surprised when we face a substantial terrorist or military enemy.</p>

<p>I totally agree with you and there's me thinking you are a Pacifist</p>

<p>As ex-Service, do you think that our forces have been properly equiped to fight in the last decade or so?</p>

<p>Exhibit A: Snatch Landrovers.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Probably not I would double the Defense Budget, Get the Money by reducing Foreign Aid . <br/>Also bring Veterans Benefits up to US Standards. And yes they are far better than ours, how do I know? I lived in Norfolk Virginia for 10 years the home of the US Navy and the Largest Naval facility in the world in <br/>Norfolk every thing revolves around the Navy</p>

<p>I suspect foreign aid is 'kickbacks' anyway.</p>

<p>Also, I always get more respect as a veteran in the US than I ever get here in the UK.</p>

<p>Well Well I totally agree with you again. But why wont you disclose your Military record were you  Special Forces?</p>

<p>He'd love to think he was but the under 5 assault course was a little too taxing. </p>

<p>Quite he was accepted by the Cubs but Could not get into Scouts</p>

<p>you know what Josh, they all seem to have done a runner, including Bazza Cashin, Englands greatest ever opening bat and panto dame</p>

<p>Special needs more like. I suspect old Seax was a full screw in the Ladies Auxiliary Balloon Corps. His job was painting the balloons nice pastel shades, to match his dress. Have you noticed, he used the word veteran. I don't know anyone who has served HM forces, describe themselves as a veteran. He's been watching too much Yank Telly, </p>

<p>Willie, I suspect that you are correct, he is very shy about his Military Record maybe he had a part as an extra in a James Bond film. Veteran is definitely Yank <br/>we would say ex Services or ex military</p>

<p>There is a Government 'Veterans' Agency'.  In addition, that badge that veterans can apply for clearly says 'veteran' on it.</p>

<p>I am starting to wonder if you have had military service if you do not know these things.</p>

<p>In addition, you raised the word 'veteran' and I responded by discussing how veterans are treated in the US.  I see no problem with this.</p>

<p>This is what you said just before I used the word 'veteran':</p>

<p>"Also bring Veterans Benefits up to US Standards".</p>

<p>You did not say: 'Also bring UK ex-Service personnel's benefits up to US Veterans Benefits standards'.</p>

<p>So what is your point again?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.rafathetford.org.uk/images/veteran_badge.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.rafathetford.org.uk...</a><br/><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/veterans-uk" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/government/...</a></p>

<p>I note, that despite all your squeaking,you have still not chosen to give any information about your personal Military Service. Until you do so most people will choose not to attach any credibility to your Posts.</p>

<p>I have no interest in your opinion of my credibility and you do not speak for the other readers.</p>

<p>indeed Josh. I find him quite strange. Keeps going on about the so called righties but then says we are in hock to the commies. Strange chap indeed.  Definitely now ex mob.</p>

<p>I point out the hypocrisy of rightwingers.</p>

<p>They moan about the 'far left' and then applaud the handing over of our jobs and assets to Communist countries.</p>

<p>No comment from the right. I wonder why?</p>

<p>They, probably, never thought that our jobs are being outsourced to Communists before.</p>

<p>But they worry about imigrants who pay tax here.How much tax from a Communist sweatshop worker goes in UK coffers?</p>

<p>I expect to hear nothing from right wing apologists.</p>

<p>Cameron 's gesture politics will make us all a target.  If air strikes would achieve anything I would support it, but it wont.  Without troops on the ground its all just  a gesture.  Unfortunately gestures make us a target.  We should all be scared by this.. Remember Paris, would you sit outside a caf√© once Cameron does this?</p>

<p>Much to Cold in London to sit around outside</p>

<p>Have you ever seen a by election where the (newly elected) leader of one of the major parties can't turn up to campaign because he is such a liability?</p>

<p>What an embarrassment. </p>

<p>Oh aye the Fire Brigade's Union thinks so.</p>

<p>He is useless on the doorstep, why is that?  Because he has never ever had to actually campaign in a close election, despite being in the commons for 32 years.</p>

<p>No because he is a bumbling Left Wing fool who is useless period</p>

<p>It is only being noticed now, he has been "fighting" for his seat for 32 years.</p>

<p>And is Cameron a fool for trashing our defences against terrorists?</p>

<p>You can say what you like about Corbyn but he hasn't, actually, done anything. The Tories have and it includes massively cutting the forces, intelligence services, border forces and police.</p>

<p>Do you think that was a good idea?</p>

<p>And what for? To cut taxes for the rich.</p>

<p>Air strikes, alone, will be pointless and potentially counterproductive.  That is what wise military heads say.  That is what Corbyn said.</p>

<p>However that is not what the press reports.</p>

<p>which military heads say that. I have not seen the head of the RAF or the Army or Navy say that. Or was it something you read in the Beano</p>

<p>Serving military leaders are not 'supposed' to speak out on political issues. Perhaps you didn't know that because some are quite happy to suggest mutiny if they do not get their favoured PM.</p>

<p>So you betray your lack of knowledge.</p>

<p>but you just said wise military heads said that the strikes will be pointless. So make up your mind bollick brain, they either did or didn't. All that flogging your mutton is affecting your memory</p>

<p>I did, indeed, say wise military heads.  Such brains would not place themselves in danger of Courts Martial by suggesting mutiny.  You may be struggling with the concept.</p>

<p>I will allow the tone of your comment to pass as it is rather late on a Saturday and last orders was a while ago, wasn't it.</p>

<p>don't drink old fruit. Sober as a communist fanatic</p>

<p>Then you have no excuse, sirrah.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/21/case-bombing-syria-david-cameron-airstrikes-iraq-dangerous" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/com...</a></p>

<p>From Peter Ford, ex ambassador to Syria.</p>

<p>Listen to what he has to say on tonight's PM also.<br/><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06q73w4" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programme...</a>.</p>

<p>Peter Ford another fully paid up member of the Foreign Office Camel Club.. It was their 'Expert Arabist" advice that got us where we are now</p>

<p>And you think airstrikes are a good idea?</p>

<p>Did it work in Vietnam? Pray tell.</p>

<p>It seems that if someone is an expert, the righties try to run them down so they can do whatever stupid thing they wanted to do in the first place.</p>

<p>Rather kill them before they start killing us</p>

<p>Kill anyone that looks a bit brown?</p>

<p>Where do you begin looking?<br/>Those who attacked Paris lived in neighbouring Belgium.<br/>7/7 bombers born/raised in Britain.</p>

<p>They are not interested in destroying the terrorist gangs.  They just want to help spend our taxes on missiles.  Might as well shoot them at stuffed 'Guys' on Salisbury Plain.</p>

<p>What needs to happen, as Corbyn suggests, is those that supply arms and money to the terrorists should be identified and sorted out.</p>

<p>Not one rightie seems to have grasped this or supported it.  It seems that they are afraid to do so for some reason.</p>

<p>Also Corbyn suggests a UN solution to the crisis. Within International Law.  Any military 'solutions' should be planned and comprehensive rather than just knee-jerking for domestic headline audiences.</p>

<p>That makes sense to me.</p>

<p>However, we need to publically identify those individuals and States that supply these terrorists with money and weapons.<br/>Why not call for this righties?  What is the argument against it?</p>

<p>Are you suggesting that Corbyn wants boots on the ground too?<br/>If not, what are you suggesting his position is?</p>

<p>Do you know what he has said on the subject or are you relying on the rightwing press for your 'headlines'?</p>

<p>Can you not give a straight answer?</p>

<p><b> Read what he actually said rather than what you have been told he said.</b></p>

<p><b>Then, giving a straight answer, tell me what you think is wrong with this statement.  However, you cannot use any headlines or misrepresentations of Corbyns comments by the press.  You can only comment on what was actually said (as shown below).</b></p>

<p><b>We are all ears.  Let us see if you can debate the issues rather than throw around tabloid headlines.</b></p>

<p><i>"We've all been horrified by the despicable attacks in Paris and are determined to see the defeat of ISIS.</i></p>

<p><i>"Our first priority must be the security of Britain and the safety of the British people. The issue now is whether what the PM is proposing strengthens, or undermines, our national security.</i></p>

<p><i>"I do not believe that the PM today made a convincing case that extending UK bombing to Syria would meet that crucial test. Nor did it satisfactorily answer the questions raised by us and the Foreign Affairs Committee.</i></p>

<p><i>"In particular, the PM did not set out a coherent strategy, coordinated through the UN for the defeat of ISIS. Nor has he been able to explain what credible and acceptable ground forces could retake and hold territory freed from ISIS control by an intensified air campaign.</i></p>

<p><i>"In my view, the PM has been unable to explain the contribution of additional UK bombing to a comprehensive negotiated political settlement of the Syrian civil war, or its likely impact on the threat of terrorist attacks in the UK.</i></p>

<p><i>"For these, and other reasons, I do not believe the PM's current proposal for air strikes in Syria will protect our security and therefore cannot support it."</i></p>

<p><i>He told BBC News: "From what I have seen from the response to the prime minister's statement today it feels to me that we are building a consensus now for military action in Syria as part of a package of British response which will include a humanitarian and a very strong diplomatic/political strand as well."</i></p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34939109" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-p...</a></p>

<p>I'm sorry, can you point me to the bit where it says what he actually proposes? You indicated that he supports more than just air strikes, where does it say this?</p>

<p>Should I have used crayon instead</p>

<p>Say what is wrong with what he said.</p>

<p>He didn't propose any alternatives. Anyone can oppose something. </p>

<p>They whole statement is an 'alternative'.  You just didn't read it, did you.</p>

<p>No it's not. It's just the usual Corbyn waffle, with nothing concrete. Are we all meant to guess what he actually means?</p>

<p>We have to guess what the Tories are going to do.</p>

<p>They will bomb, occassionally random, people and then what?</p>

<p>We also have to guess what they are going to do about dealing with the individuals and countries that give cash and weapons to Daesh.</p>

<p>Corbyn is quite clear: Unsupported airstrikes are insufficent and may makes things worse.  The answer is a more comprehensive solution that includes ground forces, politics, diplomacy and 'hearts and minds'.</p>

<p>That last one is the hardest for the righties to understand because they do not comprehend empathy.</p>

<p>I agree that we will need more than airstrikes. <br/>Corbyn would never support such a comprehensive approach if it includes British troops. </p>

<p>That remains to be seen.  However, have the Tories committed to sending troops?  If so, where are they going to get them from?  They just sacked a load.</p>

<p>I suppose we could wait for their brilliantly announced  Rapid Reaction Force to arrive in 2025.  I suspect it will come at the same time as that consignment of jam we were promised.</p>

<p>This should be called 'The Keystone Parliament'.</p>

<p>Stop pretending that the man who two months ago stated he could think of no reason why he would ever deploy British troops now wants to block airstrikes because it isn't enough.</p>

<p>You may feel that the tories' approach doesn't go far enough but you are at odds with your leader. </p>

<p>He also said that he was sure that there are situations where British troops could be deployed.  You missed that part of the sentance.</p>

<p>How do you expect to be taken seriously posting bs like that.</p>

<p>The public aren't as thick as you'd like to believe. </p>

<p>What "Leadership crisis"  what on earth are you talking about. . .   The Telegraph shouldn't be making it up as they go along working to their own agenda -- you really have no credibility left at all.</p>

<p>You're right, there is no leadership of the labour party so it should just be called a "crisis".</p>

<p>There is only a Labour 'leadership crisis' for the rightwingers in and outside the Party.  The membership gave the new learder a huge mandate.</p>

<p>However, it would be nice if the MSM reported the news rather than spreading Tory propoganda.</p>

<p>Reporting the truth. Outrageous. <br/>Such a thing would be "discouraged" in Comrade Corbyn's world if he were leader.</p>

<p>Anyone disagreeing with this principle would soon be sent to Raqqa to "negotiate" with IS</p>

<p>Careful: Cameron deals with the Communists far more than Corbyn.</p>

<p>It will be a task of a few seconds to find him drinking in a pub with one or watching a football match with one. Or selling our power generation to one.</p>

<p>Besties 4 Ever?</p>

<p>Your last statement makes very little sense.  Perhaps you might like to expand on this.</p>

<p>I suspect you want to bomb Raqqa into the stone age but what about the innocent people there?  Those that are being raped an murdered by Daesh?  Kill them all and let God seperate the innocent from the guilty?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34928547" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/maga...</a></p>

<p>Not at all. I just want IS eradicated. No doubt some innocents will die. That is highly unfortunate but such is war.</p>

<p>130 innocents died in Paris. </p>

<p>So you are relaxed about killing Syrian innocents.</p>

<p>What is the exchange rate in your mind? 500 Syrian innocents for one EU innocent? 5000? 50, 000?</p>

<p>If you are going to kill innocents, then make sure it isn't a stupid way to do it that will achieve little other than make more terrorists.</p>

<p>Relaxed is not the right word. It indicates that people glory in killing and death. Only IS do this. </p>

<p>But the righties say thinks like 'kill them before they kill us'.  They don't seem to worry about whether they kill the terrorists or innocents.</p>

<p>If we are to do this we should do so in a way that will work.</p>

<p>You might hope that the terrorists stand alone in empty fields with a big sign saying 'Terrorist Here' but that isn't what will happen.  Bunging Storm Shadows at a town will kill innocent people.  I would rather that their deaths were done for a reason other than making rightwing tabloid readers feel good about themselves.</p>

<p>I think you totally (and perhaps deliberately) underestimate the strength of our intelligence on the ground and the methods and types of air attack that we employ.</p>

<p>No one is suggesting we blitz Raqqa or carpet bomb the whole country. </p>

<p>What do you know about the intelligence on the ground?  You are speculating.  Considering how MI6's funding has been cut and the Forces budget has been cut, we are likely to have fewer assets than we did in the old days.</p>

<p>In addition, killing innocent civilians will not make them want to spy on our behalf, will it.</p>

<p>When it comes to airstrikes what do we have?  Brimstone, Paveway, Storm Shadow and Tomahawk.</p>

<p>How do you suggest that Raqqa be targetted in such a way that these weapons only hit terrorists?</p>

<p>This is attacking the wrong part of the problem. We need to pinch off their revenue and weapon supplies.  That means identifying the individuals and countries that are propping up Daesh.  Then help local forces to deal with the issue.</p>

<p>By all means use air assets to support local forces when they endgame starts.</p>

<p>It is basic Sun Tzu.</p>

<p>So you support boots on the ground. Will that mean no innocent civilians get killed?</p>

<p>People will get killed whatever.  However, bombing people from the sky will be great propaganda.</p>

<p>You cannot liberate people from terrorist organisation control by bombing them.</p>

<p>The land has to be taken away from Daesh.  Again, you cannot do  this by bombing alone.</p>

<p>Therefore, you need a combination of attacks. Financial, political, 'hearts and minds', military.  A spectrum.</p>

<p>t would be better if the Middle East sorted themselves out with UN support rather than the Daesh propagandists getting hold of the 'gold' of a Crusader War.</p>

<p>Corbyn wants us to do nothing. No boots on the ground, no airstrikes, no spectrum.</p>

<p>No doubt he'd invite the leaders of IS to parliament for a nice cup of tea though.</p>

<p>Of course, I might turn a blind eye if a known terrorist was slotted but officially  I would be all for the rule of law.</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn: Labour's gift to the Tories, that just keeps on giving!</p>

<p>Grant Shapps.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34952981" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-p...</a></p>

<p>At least Schapps has resigned. </p>

<p>yes but Schapp, whilst being a class one tool, is not a danger to our security and last time I looked, wasn't cosying up to folk who fling gays off roofs  in their spare time</p>

<p>The Tories are a danger to our security as they have run down our security and military services to give their mates tax cuts.</p>

<p>They then sell a strategic asset to the Communists.</p>

<p>What next?</p>

<p>what strategic asset was that then.</p>

<p>Power generation.</p>

<p>Such hypocrisy. Corbyn would disband the army given half a chance. </p>

<p>He has not been given half a chance but the Tories have.  Guess what, they massively cut back so our army is the smallest it has been for 250 years.</p>

<p>And they actually handed over power generation to the Communists.  How does that sit with rightwingers like yourself?</p>

<p>Judge the Tories by their actions rather than judge Corbyn by what righties claim he might do.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I judge Corbyn and his cronies' by their own words and deeds. They nauseate me.</p>

<p>Evening Willie. With a little bit luck the Scarecrow will never ever get the chance</p>

<p>So you are happy to have the Tories run down our forces?</p>

<p>They MASSIVELY ran them down.  They even gave redundancy notices to troops fighting on the front line.</p>

<p>Have you nothing to say to that?  Or is it just dandy?</p>

<p>you really are a buffoon. The Chinese are investing in our nuclear power station. How is that dangerous. Its not like there are going to be Chinese engineers in the stations ready to pull the plug.</p>

<p>Also the Western Provinces of China are full of followers of "The Religion of Peace" who are already playing up but the Chinese supress the news. The next great War will be between Islam and the Chinese who are ruthless I would not be betting on  the Dish Dash Merchants as an awful lot of them will be on their way to Pardise to meet their Virgins</p>

<p>Oh, so when they charge over the odds in charges you will be OK that we are helping to fund the Communist miracle 10 yr plan?</p>

<p>When in history as a sovereign power handed over a strategic asset to a foreign power?</p>

<p>so that's it, the Chinese will make us pay more for our electric bills and by doing that bring us down. Is there no end to your strategic genius. I mean, are you naturally this bright or do you practice it. I can see the headlines now " UK in the Dark over China".  Honestly people like you are the reason Tigers eat their young</p>

<p>Name a Labour Government that did the same.</p>

<p>If they did you would have been up in arms chanting 'Maoists'  or Reds or somesuch.</p>

<p>However, you seem to think that selling out to the Communists is just fine when Tories do it.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Mind you we do cosy up to the Saudi's, 9/11 was plotted by no less than 15 (IIRC) Saudi nationals yet still we sell them guns and stuff etc etc...as does America...as does France...they gift the West 'Wahhabism'.</p>

<p>Don't forget that the Government and press don't seem to be bothered to find out who are the rich donors that fund Daesh.</p>

<p>Why is that?</p>

<p>Corbyn said we should stop them from funding terror groups but nothing seems to happen there.</p>

<p>so let me get this right. You are saying we are arming and training Isis. Different take on it I must admit. Whats in it for us that gays are flung off roofs, women treated as chattels, and prisoners are tortured, burned to death, drowned or beheaded. You are nothing if not entertaining Sandie, oh by the way do you still sing in your bare feet</p>

<p>We sell the Saudi's guns and Prince Charles just luuurves a good cuppa and a round of horse polo with them, we also flew the flag half mast when the King died for a regime that does all of the above.<br/>Are you morally outraged there?<br/>Please be consistent.</p>

<p>not in the slightest, you can get morally outraged all you want. It wont affect anything or anybody. That's all lefties do, they get morally outraged, go on a demo and send out strongly worded letters etc. Nobody gives a toss Sandie about you and your morals, which seem to be conflicted as you seem to have a smidgen of sympathy for ISIS, still that is consistent with the Party leadership in the way Corbyn and Co. cosy up to all sorts of terrorists. Now you can take your moral outrage out for a walk, I am sure its needs the exercise</p>

<p>I like the way you choose ignore that the UK sells guns to terrorists, guns that end up arming who knows who or what, really telling of the right wing voter's inability to think for themselves.<br/>We armed 'the rebels' in Syria back in 2013, you do not have a clue whose hand these damned  things are in now.<br/> Sympathy for ISIS?<br/>Are you for real?<br/>Up to the *likes* of Corbyn we wouldn't even be dealing with any one of those ME regions in the first place, we wouldn't be in the EU, left traditionally opposed, right wing idiots as right wing idiots do only seeing a fast buck, an 'angle', something to capitalise on.<br/>Yet still you want the UK to further involvement, and somehow that makes you all present and correct.</p>

<p>we are the second biggest arms exporter behind the Yanks on the planet Sandie. Doesn't make me lose a seconds sleep at night.  As for Corbyn and the ME, he has friends there does he not, Hamas, Hezbelloh. As for the EU etc I couldn't care less, you can rant on all you want, I have some rain drops I have to watch running down my window, that's how interested I am in what you think. Oh and as for bombing Syria, it wont affect you. You wont be doing any of the bombing. So you can get on with your existence</p>

<p>Would it make you lose some sleep if your significant other was killed by such arms in a terror attack?</p>

<p>whats a significant other.</p>

<p>I am hardly surprised.</p>

<p>We may be helping regions by selling them guns that may be used to create terror groups that then attack us, and you won't lose any sleep over that.<br/>What a strange thing to say.</p>

<p>not at all,  we all have to die sometime. Not worried about it cos I cant affect it. Why don't you do something concrete about it, instead of coming on here and whipping your morals out of your pants in order to  have them outraged.</p>

<p>You are too unintelligent to continue talking to.<br/>Bye.</p>

<p>not a prob Sandie, by the way are you still singing barefoot.  Now remember to give that signed photo of David Icke a good polish,, theres a good boy/girl/horse</p>

<p>Alas, I think we're only about fifth or sixth biggest arms exporter. Russia, China, Germany and perhaps France have been selling more than we've managed over the last half decade or so.</p>

<p>We must try harder</p>

<p>Well, quite. A big, profitable, diverse arms exporting industry's a blessing to any country, for several reasons.</p>

<p>I stand erected.</p>

<p>Yet another press assassination of this admirable man of intelligence and principles.</p>

<p>you also forgot to add, and complete and utter naivety</p>

<p>The once-great Labour Party has elected a completely inept and incompetent leader and now we can see his hand-wringing and weasel words when the going gets tough. He makes Neville Chamberlain look like a decisive leader!</p>

<p>Last week it was "Oh I don't think the police should have the power to shoot-to-kill these misguided chaps with their Kalashnikovs. No. Instead, I shall send them a strongly-worded letter, imploring them to stop"</p>

<p>If that is what you mean by "principled" I think I would rather have "sane".</p>

<p>You are making stuff up or do you really believe what you write?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we have proof that the Tories have been systematically running down all of the forces that could protect us from terrorists.</p>

<p>Isn't that worse?</p>

<p>I have to mention Ken Livingstone again because he is of Jeremy Corbyn's ilk.</p>

<p>He keeps ranting on about ballot rigging if an elected MP doesn't meet with his approval as not being left wing enough, also saying they don't reflect the Labour party as they were vetted by New Labour.</p>

<p>He a relic of the past and keeps harping on about the old days, the second world war, the days of the GLC etc. etc.</p>

<p>I hear him a lot on LBC radio.</p>

<p>The ranting   depends how much elbow exercise he has had earlier in the day, you can actually here it in his voice.</p>

<p>Ken Livingstone is a bigoted bully. He plays to the liberal left gallery, but his intolerance of dissent shows him to be the nasty little Trot that he is. Corbyn being elected leader was Ken's last chance to see his party become the hard left Trotskyite party he always dreamed off. Not realising that the British people are neither hard left or far right. He is openly anti Semitic and pro any terror group that happens to target anything he doesn't agree with. For example PIRA during the 80's, when he refused to condemn their bombings in the mainland of Britain or anywhere else for that matter. His crowning glory of course is when he went to the extradition trial in the US, of an IRA killer,  wanted for the murder of a Met PC and a London Underground tube driver. He gave evidence for the defence of the IRA gunman. Stating that the IRA man would almost certainly be killed if he returned. So in the end the IRA man was allowed to stay in the States, nice one Ken.  So much for Livingstone and his claims of believing in resolving conflicts by peaceful means</p>

<p>The man is treacherous and if Corbyn doesn't get rid of him, then he's as bad by condoning him.</p>

<p>they both are as bad as each other mate. Corbyn is a fan of Hamas and Hezbelloh as well as PIRA. Even though the two muslim terror groups are both anti gay and do not support womens rights, to put it mildly, oh and they want the destruction of the entire Jewish race, not just Israel.  In the Times yesterday they found a speech McDonnell made some time ago, where he said the North of Ireland would be freed from Brit rule by the Ballot, Bomb and Bullet. So you see they really are an unholy trinity at the top of the Labour party. Personally I hope they stay there for years,  I need the fun</p>

<p>'A fan'?</p>

<p>You do know that being a 'fan' of PIRA included having peace talks with them in public when the Government (Tories) were having talks in secret.</p>

<p>Do you think it was right for the Tories to be hiding their interactions with PIRA?</p>

<p>And why did they hand over hundreds of millions to Saddam so he could kill our troops more efficiently?  Why did Tories try to help smuggle a longrang ballistic weapon to them?</p>

<p>The think with you lot is you close your eyes to spin and any 'interesting' behaviour from those on the right.</p>

<p>For example:Why doesn't the Government name and shame those individuals that are funding IS/Daesh?</p>

<p>Some people would say that it was a Traitorous act and I would not necessarily disagree with them</p>

<p>So why is Corbyn the focus of the anger of the press when he hasn't done anything to degrade our ability to defend ourselves but the Tories have?</p>

<p>Its only because he hasnt been given the opportunity<br/>and hopeully will never be given the chance</p>

<p>So what are your thoughts about what the Tories have ACTUALLY done to degrade our military and security services?</p>

<p>Answer please.</p>

<p>the Tories negotiated alright but they stopped short of admiring them and calling them heroes and freedom fighters. As for giving Saddam kit to kill our troop, I could have sworn that all the Iraqi small arms are AK 47,. their tanks Russian, their aircraft were Russian, the SAM'S Russian, I bet their bogs were probably made in Russia, <br/>The thing with people like you mate, is that you probably believe there is some sort of international conspiracy that is funding all this strife in order to fill the coffers of some controlling organization like the illuminati, also that the twin tower attacks were all the work of that organization with the USA helping out,  and may I say, anyone who believes in that bollix is a complete and utter half wit. Take your pick son.</p>

<p>You, obviously, only repeat what you have been told by the rightwing media.  Your grasp of history seems to be one-sided as well.</p>

<p>They even smuggled tanks to Iraq at one point:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/28/iraq.politics1" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/wor...</a></p>

<p>It is, also, interesting to read this piece on what the Kurds (apparently our allies) thought of Thatcher and her actions.</p>

<p><a href="http://kurdistantribune.com/2013/how-thatcher-helped-saddam-commit-genocide/" rel="nofollow">http://kurdistantribune.com/20...</a></p>

<p>Hit the nail on the head Willie</p>

<p>The Tories just sent international tyrants and killers Christmas cards.</p>

<p>so let me see, you hate the Tories and the Right, yet you say we are handing power over to the Chinese Communists. I thought that would be ideal for Jezza and his pet dolphin Ken. Oh and you of course Comrade</p>

<p>The Tories have gotten into bed with Communists and you just hate it. You just cannot admit it.</p>

<p>All of those years claiming that lefties were communists and now you cannot do so without sounding stupid.</p>

<p>Why?  Because the rightwingers have sold us out to the Communists.</p>

<p>What next?  Farming? Security?  What?  What is not beneath the Tories to sell off to the Communists?</p>

<p>And the private sector have been betraying the people to the Communists for decades by sending their jobs to them.</p>

<p>Did you not notice?</p>

<p>make up your mind son, You cant have your cake and eat it. You either like the commies or you don't. You are not very bright are you. But look I got to hit the chariot now, so I will leave you to lie alone in you scratcher, gazing longingly at the full length photo of Jezza you have on the ceiling of your bedsit. Just remember its Jezza, or in you case Jizza</p>

<p>But it is the righties that hate Communists.  Except when they are selling our power generation to them. Or sending our citizens' jobs to them.</p>

<p>It is rightes like you that are conflicted.</p>

<p>The latter part of your comment, clearly, is projection.</p>

<p>I am not  a rightie son.  But God knows what you are,  I doubt you know yourself</p>

<p>The person to blame for all this is Miliband. He was elected leader but he only wanted to be PM, he lost the election, he made up the stupid election system then stood down with no notice the day couldn't be the big man. The whole party is a joke now.</p>

<p>Miliband.Another over educated Bloody Fool from a Communist background</p>

<p>This smear is rather distasteful. His father fought for our country.</p>

<p>Have you?</p>

<p>Yes Suez and Cyprus , my father Siege of Malta and Dodecanese he was terribly wounded . Milibands father almost certainly a Storeman or a Clerk So now lets hear about your military record and what you have done for your Country? Dont be shy,  Cubs? or did you get promoted to the Boy Scouts.<br/>look at the Avatar  12th Foot</p>

<p>I also have a military record.  I also come from a long line of people that served our country and many died in that service.</p>

<p>It seems to me that you hold your comrades-in-arms cheaply if you are so quick to dismiss other's service to their Nation.  Or, in his case, a previously foreign country.</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>"Miliband was anxious to join the war effort and volunteered to be parachuted into Belgium to work with the resistance. In January 1942 he passed his medical examination, but was told that he could not "voluntarily join until authorisation was sought from the Polish authorities (as he was not yet a Belgian national)." Miliband now asked Harold Laski for help to join the armed forces. "A few days later, I had a letter from A.V. Alexander, the First Lord of the Admiralty, telling me that he was pleased to hear from Laski about my wish to join the Navy and advising me to go and see a vice-admiral at the Admiralty, who would fix it up. Which he did."</p>

<p>Miliband eventually saw action in June 1944 when he was involved in the D-Day landings in Normandy. He wrote that this was "the biggest operation in history" and he "would not miss it for anything". Miliband then joined the Mediterranean war fleet and saw action in the landings near Toulon. During this period he considered the possibility of being killed while fighting for his adopted country: "Because most people just can't visualise getting killed suddenly and soon. I know I can't. I realise full well that within let us say six months I may be dead but somehow it does not assume an air of reality. The words, the idea sound hollow. Better that it does. Yet the possibility and the knowledge of the possibility do make some difference."</p>

<p><a href="http://spartacus-educational.com/HISmiliband.htm" rel="nofollow">http://spartacus-educational.c...</a></p>

<p>So lets not be shy lets hear your military record not the Record of your  Ancestors.<br/>As for Miliband Senior "asked Harold Laski for help"<br/>" had a letter from the first Lord of the Admiralty"<br/>Poor bloody Infantry was not for him. What was there to stop him joining the Polish Forces in Britain,?<br/>By coincidence my family also came from Poland, a young man a family  friend turned up at my Grandfathers house. He joined the the Polish Army in Britain. It didnt take a letter from the First Lord of the Admiralty.</p>

<p><br/>I do not make it a habit to parade my military record details on the internet.  I will say, however,  that I have two service numbers.</p>

<p>So you think that only the Infantry serve their country by shedding their blood?  I hope not.</p>

<p>sorry son, Ed's dad did serve this country but he also didn't like it very much. He once said we were the worst nationalists in the world. Considering he escaped from the Nazis and came here and he had relatives killed by the National Socialist Party of Germany, one would have thought that the Germans were the worst nationalists. Still he managed to blag a huge house in Hampstead of a chum and his boys are both extremely rich. Now that's the type of communist I like, a rich one. By the way he loved this country so much he wanted it dismantled and is on record as saying, he almost wished we would lose the war. Strange chap eh. Bit like you and Jezz son</p>

<p>All smears.</p>

<p>And yet it is the Tories that have run down our armed and security forces and sell our State assets to the Communists.</p>

<p>Indeed, they are quite happy to allow the transfer of our peoples' jobs to the Communists as well.</p>

<p>Does that sound like the Tories of old or is this some new kind of Red Tory?</p>

<p>all truth, only smears for those like you who refuse to acknowledge the truth. He said it, and its on record. When it was revealed early last year, Ed did nothing about it. He never threatened to sue, because it was all there I black and white.  But I don't know why a commie like you is so upset over power being handed to Chinese communists. Unless they are the wrong type of commie for you</p>

<p>Concrete proof that education doesnt mean you actually know anything. Look at the Ed Stone, produced by Ed the PhD  graduate, it shows he doesn't know the difference between a concrete promise and an aspiration.</p>

<p>"Blame for what?"   the biggest joke is the Conservative party -- since Corbyn was elected Labour leader he's met the tories head on and they've made u turn after u turn.    They'r the joke.  And the biggest joke of all is Cameron is trying to fool the nation again with this "let's go off to war' rhetoric.</p>

<p>What a laugh you are,  have you not noticed what is going on in Labour.</p>

<p>Yes -- at last there a leader with true values with a track record of being right.  The challenges he's made to the conservative party have resulted in u turn after u turn.   The "leadership crisis" is a fiction made up by a scared press.  Don't be a sheep.  Take a look at reality and stop following the words of the Telegraph blindly.  There endeth the lesson.</p>

<p>The biggest laugh is the Tory party.   How scared are they.</p>

<p>We will see how scared UKIP is next week in the election in Meachers old seat</p>

<p>Swerve.</p>

<p>It is a clown car.  The first wheel fell off when Osborne had to jettison his flagship 'smiting of the vulnerable' plan.</p>

<p>These extreme lefties are a danger to our country.</p>

<p>I heard Ken Livingstone say on LBC radio this morning that the suicide bombers gave their lives in protest against the Iraq war in the 7/7 bombing which killed dozens of people in London.  Maybe I misheard because I couldn't believe it.</p>

<p>They should be tried for treason.</p>

<p>What should happen to those who have rund down our defences against terrorists? Army: Massively Cut, Navy: Massively Cut, RAF: Massively Cut, Border Agency: Massively Cut who else?  Oh yes, MI5, MI6, GCHQ, the Police all cut.</p>

<p>Indeed, cut so badly that even the PM complained about it when his police force cut services.</p>

<p>So if you want to point a finger then point it at the Communist's Friend: The Tory Party.</p>

<p>Dont be such a Twerp however strong our Forces were Corbyn the blunderer would not use them, he is a pacifist</p>

<p>So what do you call someone who savagely runs down our defences?</p>

<p>Did you support these cuts?  Do you think they have left us unexposed? Will our Service personnel suffer as a result?</p>

<p>Did you see the 'announcements' last week?  Surely you saw all of the BS in it.  They paraded actually buying aircraft for an aircraft carrier as some kind of 'initiative'.</p>

<p>You cannot have it both ways.  You cannot support the Tories and say you support strong defence.  Look at the cuts they made prior to the Falklands.  They never learn because their motivation is tax cuts at any cost.  The cost is the cost our Service people have to take.</p>

<p>Poor equipment, low manning and redundancy notices on the front line.  Is that what you support?</p>

<p>Indeed, IIRC military spending went up under the Neo Liberal New Labour lot.</p>

<p>no you didn't, he said more or less the same thing on Question Time.</p>

<p>They are all filth. I hope UKIP take Oldham and expose what they are, a party for everyone except working white hetrosexuals.</p>

<p>People ought to be very careful before being swept up by the mass hysteria jingoism. I predict carnage on the streets of Britain, Paris-style, if we stick our noses into this. All the jingo commentators on here seem to be living in fantasy land. Britain is no longer an imperial power. It is a second rank country with limited defence forces (as a result of this government's own cutbacks) drowning in consumer debt. We cannot afford it either money-wise or in terms of the threat to our own people's lives.</p>

<p>There will be carnage in the UK anyway when the muslim population is 50%</p>

<p>Rather rude I think.</p>

<p>I take it you meant me mate. I think you and Uncle Joe sing from the same copy of Das Kapital</p>

<p>correct Joseph, in uniform all that time and totally institutionalised. You should have tried it, would have beaten your last job of toilet attendant hands down. Still I am sure you were proud to follow in the family tradition. Plus, you got to hang around the gents late in the evenings. Did you not you meet your wife there ?</p>

<p>I am still amazed that some idiots decide to join the army. Still, it takes all sorts. I have yet to meet an ex forces man who could participate in debate.</p>

<p>So you agree with Corbyn that we shouldn't have armed forces then Uncle Joe.   So what do you suggest. We all be like you and just have a white flag handy in case of emergencies</p>

<p>White flags were of no use to the civilians of Fallujah, nor the citizens of Belfast.</p>

<p>would be good for you, if only for the reason you ever have a nose bleed for having to do something worthwhile in your life,  and now Comrade Joe, I got to get to bed. Some of us have a well heeled retirement to enjoy.</p>

<p>I'll gamble it is not as well heeled as mine, unless you made ACCO.</p>

<p>No. I met your wife.</p>

<p>fascinating, she told me about it. Said your dad and you had a good thing going down there. You pumped and he cleaned</p>

<p>Nice one Willie</p>

<p>Hi Willie Mohan ....your'e a right Jobs' comforter LOL  .Why havn't they done something before ? Only because we have not interfered  . and the water surrounding our Country has limited any incursion . As far as I know ISIL does</p>

<p>not have ships or Planes , but may have  followers already in Britain ready to strike.</p>

<p>Not far from where I live, thanks to a Neighbour phoning the Police, 2 young men living next to the Neighbour was caught making Bombs. Another clue, one of the Migrants in Calais was asking where Huddersfield was??</p>

<p>you did see the evidence given to the select committee a week or so back by the head of MI5/6, that they are constantly disrupting terror plots in this country by ISIS. I think he said 7 in the last month alone.  We haven't been hit since Lee Rigby's murder because our security services are working non stop to foil them. They murdered Lee Rigby with knives because they couldn't get any firearms. The 7/7 loons had made their bombs at home as had the other shower whose bombs didn't go off. So never mind who we bomb or if we don't bomb, they are going after us all the time. Like you say the channel and our gun laws have been crucial in all this. But as PIRA once said, "you have to be lucky all the time, we have to be lucky only once". Oh and by the way Brevitiy, they have shed loads of followers in the UK. Have you noticed the huge demos by Muslims shouting out the slogan "not in our name".  I bet you haven't noticed, neither have I. So those polls that show quite a large section of the muslim community tacitly supporting extreme Islam are not far wrong. </p>

<p>What I have noticeed is the increase in Muslim Families near where I live , they do not integrate and have a certain arrogance whish the indigenous population finds offensive. They have their own schools , shops, Butchers  etc and I gotta tell you this.......A friend of mine works for the DHSS and one day a Muslim family, Husband, Wife and 3 children came in asking for Welfare. They received ¬£100's , Rent,</p>

<p>Council Tax, Family Allowance for the 3 children and Unemployment Benifit for the Husband. The total came to over ¬£300 a week , then the Husband said "You fforgot my Mother", "where is she "said my Friend. "In Pakistan" said the Husband. but coming over !!!! I can't remember his name but the Britsh  Governor in Pakistan gave citizenship to the population before he left. I will say this though, they do work , mostly small shops and Taxi Drivers.</p>

<p>Not only that but Mr Hook who is now enjoying pork ribs at the expense of the US Goverment  lived in a very nice house not more than three miles from me. His numerous Wives and and extensive brood of Apprentice Bombers still live there and draw Benefits that we are all paying for</p>

<p>I remember him, This Country could never be competent enough to safeguard us , the Border Agency a long time ago "lost" 36 thousand migrants who they let loose while their details were being checked. Theresa May has been a useless Minister yet she is kept in her job , I can't understand why.</p>

<p>I remember him , thought his Family had left the House . This Country has a Benefit system second to none , which is why the migrants want to come here . ...it must stop. We make it far too easy and even employ English speaking Muslims paid by the NHS to take</p>

<p>non English speaking migrants to Doctors, Dentists, Hospital etc. Couldn't the Imam of a Mosque ask for volunteers in the area to help here?   Could you ever imagine any other Country in the World being so accommodating ???</p>

<p>What gets me is their lack of appreciation for being able to have all the benefits FOC.  Whether it is shyness or arrogance I don't know , but they do not mix and now we have Butchers selling Islamic meat. The House at the end of my friends' house turned into a Mosque, the shoes outside. I was in my local Tescos the other day and smiled at a beautiful little Islamic child , next thing her mother yanked her away.!!, .</p>

<p>That's good News ,, I don't remember seeing that , but do remember Police turning up at St. Pancras Station one night to catch some Migrants getting off the train from Belgium.<br/>I think if the EU had a Defence Force made up of all the Members it would have been a deterrent. Now, because of a Borderless agreement, the EU is in chaos.</p>

<p>The EU defence force has all the strength and resilience of a wet Kit Kat. They are useless, just as Belgium is useless.. The weapon that was taken off the Jihadi on the French train by the American servicemen was obtained near the Gare Du Midi, yes the main station in Brussels, where the Eurostar is. So depending on them is like depending on a damp flannel in a tsunami</p>

<p>I do remember a while ago that Britain had asked Brussels Station to report any suspicious people but the Station refused on the grounds that it was not their responsibility. Same as France , quite happy to have immigrants camped in a field without checking on them . The result was they invaded the Tunnel , did a lot of damage to the Containers, thousands of  of ¬£'s  worth of produced wasted. <br/>Cameron is a bit narcissistic, wants to be in the limelight, that it why he is happy to bomb Syria.</p>

<p>I remember during the first Gulf War.  The UK asked Belgium for extra amounts of 7.62 ammo for their GPMG's. But Belgium refused, even though they are part of NATO and as part of NATO,  are required to assist at any time.  No wonder Germany conquered them over lunch</p>

<p>No doubt the ISIL mob have sussed out the weakest Countries when they decide to invade on a big scale ...it really is very scary now wondering which will be the next Country  to be visited by Jihadists . There was no definite verdict on who shot down the Russian Plane , the investigation went very quiet .<br/>Belgium was asked by the British Police to let them know of anything suspicious that they could pick up when a train left the station. Brussels refused saying it was not their responibility. For a Union, the EU is not very united is it. ? I think it will disintegrate , especially if the U.K leaves.</p>

<p>They don't call Belgium, Belgianistan for nothing.  They contribute nowt to the Union.  </p>

<p>Hi Willie Mohan , there is no Comment facility at all today , bad news when there is  a lot going on. I don't know if this is a new Artiicle but CNN is reporting via video that Turkey has brought down a Russian JET ........and Obama is not happy with Putin. Would the EU vote in such a Dictator as the Turkish President?</p>

<p>Russia's <br/>Failed Adventure in Syria</p>

<p>by Con Coughlin  ‚Ä¢  December 1, 2015 at 5:00 <br/>am</p>

<p>Then there is the question of just how long Russia can afford to sustain its <br/>expensive military adventure in Syria. The Russian economy already has enough <br/>difficulties without having to bear the cost of Mr Putin's latest act of <br/>military aggression.</p>

<p>Left: <br/>A Russian SU-24 bomber crashing after being shot down by a Turkish F-16 fighter <br/>on Nov. 24. Right: A Syrian rebel fighter prepares to fire a TOW missile at an <br/>Assad regime tank.</p>

<p>Russian <br/>President Vladimir Putin may well come to regret agreeing to Iran's request for <br/>Moscow to intervene militarily in Syria's brutal civil war.</p>

<p>The <br/>shooting down of a Russian warplane over the Syrian border by Turkey has <br/>graphically illustrated the risks Moscow faces after the Kremlin agreed to <br/>intervene on behalf of Syria's beleaguered President Bashar al-Assad.</p>

<p>Mr <br/>Putin took his fateful decision to launch military action in Syria after meeting <br/>Major-General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's notorious Quds Force, in <br/>Moscow last August. Visiting Moscow shortly after the conclusion of June's deal <br/>on the future of Iran's nuclear programme (JCPOA), Soleimani delivered a blunt <br/>warning to the Russian leader that the Assad regime, Russia's long-standing <br/>strategic ally in the Middle East, faced defeat without outside support.</p>

<p>There is no comment for this on The Telegraph , interesting comment  from the Gladstone Institute in New York.</p>

<p>Hi Willie Mohan ,</p>

<p>Belgianistan...I like it.!!!! Many years ago my Friend and i went hitchhiking around Europe and spent some time in Belgium , Ostend. The Guy who gave us a lift took us for afternoon tea, we sat outside very near the huge Balls, can't remember the name of it. Anyway, the Waitress came with our Coffees and a cake stand full of lovely  cakes. He told us to help ourselves , which we did .  We<br/>left two cakes for shames sake , it was then he told us we should have only taken one each !!!</p>

<p>Turkey wants to join the EU and since Merkel has given TURKEY 3BILLION EUROS for helping with the migrants no doubt he will be accepted. What bothers me is  the    Ruler has a bad reputation for the way he treats his Citizens, rules with an iron fist.Will he fit in with the rest of the Members?</p>

<p>Germany and France are dead set against Turkey coming in and so they should be. Talk about a nation sleep walking toward disaster. Not so much a sleep walk as a full charge actually</p>

<p>I think Merkel is flustered and doesn't care who she asks for help. To give  EU 3, Billion of what is essentially EU money , not hers , should have raised concern but doesn't seem to have raised objection by any of the Members. I read an Article earlier that Germany is against  Merkel offering Membership to Turkey because of Dictatorship of  their Ruler.   Don't you get the impressioon because of all this that Merkel doesn't know what to do about the continuing migrant crisis. Did you see the video of a massive line of migrants walking  3 or 4 deep in the Countryside, don't know which Country they are headed for.</p>

<p>I have no objection to Pacifists, but it didn't help Belgium did it.  A long time ago I suggested the EU have Border patrols , Merkel's no Borders has been a disaster , yet she will not give in and I think has lost the plot.</p>

<p>Well Willie Mohan, I just caught sight of the tickertape on sky and it looks as if Turkey will be a Member of the EU........Merkel really has lost the plot. Giving EU 3, Billion to Turkey for helping to stop migrants entering Germany has merited unparalled generosity and I think shows how anxious Merkel is about the ever increasing immigrants entering Germany.</p>

<p>If Cameron doesn't make hay while the Sun shines by handing Merkel the list of Britains'demands , it is because he doesn't want us to leave.</p>

<p>know, but we don't know what Merkel promised, the E3 BILLION....that's a lot of money, how much of it will have to be paid by all the Members. ? France and Germany are very close but France has no clout what'sisname Junckle? seems to be spokesman . I will lay odds that if the E3 Billion is payable by the 26 Members there will be protests by many of them. .......that is a lot of money you must admit. , shows how desperate Merkel is , have you seen the line of Migrants walking from 3 Countries seeking asylum , all men by the look of it.</p>

<p>I think I said that Merkel was giving Turkey 3 million, it is in fact 3 Billion euros!!!! Also Turkey is looking to join the EU , Turkey is not in Europe is it??? I was on holiday in Turkey a few years ago and chatting to the Bar Staff one night , they said thy wanted to study in the U.K. but the Government would not give them a Visa.More worrying , several Turks are so poor they sell some of their Organs . It is a Dictatorship, does Merkel have the power to give Turkey 3 Billion Euros???</p>

<p>Wouldn't you think that if the EU is borderless at least some sort of</p>

<p>Army made up of Members of each Country should have been been</p>

<p>instigated. As it has been proved, Borderless  Countries was a silly idea and the end result is a migrant crisis. If there is now some sort of effort and would be migrants have to supply their Passports. I bet many of them havn't even got Passports or any means of identification.  What happens then? , Also, there are migrants coming from Africa ......utter chaos.</p>

<p>Lets' face it we have had a couple of shocks , the Russian Airplane disaster was a shock, then the deaths in France . If we don't start bombing Syria we will be alright , but Cameron wants to get in on the act , le's hope the Conservatives say NO.Plaid Cymru has voted NO , but with only 3 seats they are hardly going to cjange opinions .LOL</p>

<p>Thanks Willie Mohan ....I hope you are right , but have a feeling that some have come under the radar via Calais. Those Lads had money from somewhere , they wore well dressed designer trainers,  jackets  mobile phones, Where did they get the money from?  Apparently the Camp in Calais was used by U.K Cars to drive some across the border into Britain, again, where did they get the mney?ISIL is known to be very wealthy.</p>

<p>we cant go on worrying about it Brevity, otherwise we would never go out.  But we will be hit sooner or later. Like I said they have only to be lucky once.  As for Calais, one would hope that the French, after what happened in Paris, would clear it out and deport all those not genuine asylum seekers. Which of course is all of them.  Yes I have seen them in the nice designer sports gear, with Ipads and mobiles. Must be the best dressed migrants ever. Plus most of them look as though they have never missed a lunch</p>

<p>That's what I commented on st the time, when they were cutting the canvas roof of a Container or breaking a lock , the arrogance of them was unbeleivable . Someone on here said the  IslamicCountries are arrogant by nature , I can attest t that because where I live , there has been a big influx of Muslims and they do  not mix . Their children go to Muslim schools so there will never be able to make friends outside their Community.</p>

<p>Actually, Hollande turned a blind eye , even when a Car was seen driving to the Camp. As you say we can't go on worrying , I do care about what happens though and don't fancy having my head cut off. LOL</p>

<p>Do you really believe the head of M15/6? He has to show statistics to keep his job.</p>

<p>So you know more then Uncle Joe. Come on then tell us how you know more than the intelligence agencies.  I suppose you believe that they are keeping us all in the dark about the attack on the twin towers and how the world is controlled by a secret organization full of Zionists and Corporate war mongers. I take it the sky is red in your world these days</p>

<p>I know a little about uniformed and non uniformed sinecurial positions in local and national government agencies.</p>

<p>I bet you know loads of position Uncle Joe and you constantly inform young people you meet in parks all about them</p>

<p>Ah Jesus, the plod are on to me now!</p>

<p>shouldn't that be Jezza the plod are on to me</p>

<p>you hope they are,  whats that great song from the late great Frank Zappa, "i love a man in a uniform" anyway I got to hit my pit Joey. I know you are sending all this from your ipad as you furtively linger near some bushes. Good luck tonight, I hope its human</p>

<p>Do you really think that the boys in blue and khaki are there to protect the public? As Kissinger said, they are just dumb animals  to be used in pursuit of government policy.</p>

<p>well lets put it like this Joe, you aren't going to protect the public. And if you ever become a victim of crime, who will you run to. Jezza, I don't think so. You are just one of those whinging malcontents who dream of some socialist utopia that exists only in your febrile imagination. As for the boys in Khaki, they do more for this country in one day than you have ever done in your lifetime. They protect all those rights you lot go on about. So you just go back to the office and punch in your time and leave the work to the real men and women of this country</p>

<p>Willie, thank you for your kind regards.</p>

<p>first time I have seen someone admit to being a waste of oxygen.  Makes a change. But then you may be one of those who likes being verbally abused. Just think I don't even charge you for it either. </p>

<p>Willie Wastle dwalt on Tweed,<br/>The spot they ca'd it Linkumdoddie.<br/>Willie was a wabster guid<br/>Could stown a clue wi onie body.<br/>He had a wife was dour and din,<br/>O, Tinkler Maidgie was her mither!<br/>Sic a wife as Willie had,<br/>I wad na gie a button for her.</p>

<p>so those Klingon lessons are starting to bear fruit I see.</p>

<p>This is one very dangerous OAP Marxist Commo. He has Agenda 21 flowing through his veins. The Loony left would have this bloke send the UK straight back to the USSR of 1980 in terms of living. He should be run over by a truck load of illegals coming through the Channel Tunnel.</p>

<p>If he got in power (by vote fixing), the illegals would be us escaping to the free west through the Channel Tunnel!</p>

<p>That is Corbyns problem as a perpetual protester, what does he say to Hollande, or any other leader for his perpetual do nothing but talk about every issue.</p>

<p>Mmmm, since when is talking a problem. . .?  Corbyn has suggested, as did Paddy Ashdown after him and Bernie Saunders after him, that the way to stop ISIS is to cut off the funding.    That'd mean a bit of talking as in "we know who's funding them so let's deal with them" - instead lets go spend a few billion blowing up people in the desert and have us a nice new Iraq or Afghanistan -- because we all know how successful that was.</p>

<p>OK next time you see a fight outside a night club offer everyone tea and cakes.</p>

<p>There isn't a fight outside a club -- are you all nuts?</p>

<p>There is a fight in what used to be Iraq and Syria it is a proxy war between Shia and Sunni  which has been going on since Mohammed died, there is the fight between east and west to contain Russias expansion into the mediterranean, there is a fight between Turkomen and Kurds which has been going on for centuries and Turkey is backing the Turkomen.</p>

<p>Now Corbyn wants to go and sort it out over tea and cakes, and bring the Chinese onto Europes borders he is a joke.</p>

<p>If it's been a fight since Mohammad was about then bombs are not the answer .  I'd suggest it's more about them petrodollar and keeping the US alive and well.  Saddam Husain, Gaddafi and Assad were all about making a change - hence the nutty contradictory war after war.  Putin too wants to change the petrodollar.   Seems to be the only thing that makes sense in this nonsense.     But who know.  Bombs are not the answer -- Corbyn is right about that .  Weird having an honest politician around isn't it.</p>

<p>Yes petrodollars were always the big issue even in the 8th century.</p>

<p>Shame -- can't debate pomposity -- just as the thread might have gone somewhere of interest you have to ruin it with a smug snarky attempy at an intellectual put down -- sad Tory.  So typical.  Open your mind fool.</p>

<p>All my life sunni and shia have been fighting, I saw the weapons going up to Iraq in 1989, there is nothing intellectual about it Sunni and Shia will always fight because they disagree over who rules Islam and in the Islamic world religion is everything.</p>

<p>He is right to protest against intervention.<br/>We do not have  a clue what we are getting into.</p>

<p>We are already in there, not only bombing Iraq we are refueling others hitting Syria and providing intelligence for those hitting Syria. Will Labour say we should stop everything or have they just found a new "principle".  Whether we join in strikes only affects our ability to have a say in what else is done later.</p>

<p>Trouble is they are probably attacking the wrong side.</p>

<p>so you are saying we are not hitting Isis then</p>

<p>They are, because there are no moderates there.</p>

<p>Why are having a vote then?</p>

<p>We are having a vote to legitimise the megalomaniac Cameron's actions. Putin is the only straight shooter on Syria. He believes the West set up a disingenuous campaign to topple Assad years ago. Nothing to do with anything else but regime change for their own selfish reasons. (The Dollar) They duck and dive now in a quite ridiculous manner while crying crocodile tears for little boys lying drowned on Greek beaches, when anyone with a modicum of intelligence can see it was their downright evil that put the child there in the first place. These same idiots encouraged a fascist coup in the Ukraine. (That went well didn't it?) Make no mistake the worlds heading for another conflagration, this time humanity will be lucky to survive.</p>

<p>That is true but Russia has had a campaign to keep Syria under their control, it is just cold war politics.</p>

<p>A pointless point of principle.  If we are re fueling planes dropping bombs we are taking part, Cameron also offered use of Akrotiri in Cyprus. The vote is purely symbolic, we are taking part in bombing Syria just not actually RAF planes dropping the bombs.</p>

<p>Pointless point of principle?<br/>What?<br/>So why all the froth regards Corbyn then?</p>

<p>He is wrecking the Labour party and making the UK look stupid.</p>

<p>he's not making the UK look stupid mate, just him and his party that's all</p>

<p>When Hollande has to address him and his party it makes us look stupid</p>

<p>no it doesn't and Hollande has not addressed him or his party. They asked the British Govt for assistance and last time I looked DC and the Tories were running the show.</p>

<p>He appealed directly to Corbyn.</p>

<p>Because it is all nonsense,  and it is splitting the Labour party to pieces.</p>

<p>Exactly</p>

<p>It has finally come to the demise of the buffoon Corbyn and his Anti-war against Syria after the Paris atrocities .<br/>Labour should never have elected such an unstable character as Corbyn in the first place and as an ex Thatcherite i always welcome the fodder that Labour provide the Tories with a kind of-food for thought-in the commons.<br/>What does not make any sense is Ms Mactaggart who agrees with Corbyn in opposing British intervention in Syria and is calling for Corbyn to stand down and the first one to do so publicly.<br/>Mr Corbyns entrance as Labour leader and his exit as been a long time coming.</p>

<p>I don't think 'sticking to your guns' (pun intended) makes you unstable. Corbyn represents people who have firm and clear convictions and doesn't swing (like Cameron has done) according what he thinks is going to make him more popular to the public. He is being vilified every time he dares to fart or blink by the press and I for one am completely behind him. To follow Camerons ridiculous logic in bombing Syria says to me that, if one gang of teenagers attacks another gang. Then it's perfectly just and legal for the aggrieved gang to go out and attack the perpetrators, as this is a more effective way of reducing violence and gang warfare, and if I sell knives to both gangs I'm quids in.  or have I missed something?</p>

<p>yes - and they will probably run out of bombs anyway. what are they going to bomb with? biplanes with Cameron of the Camel Squadron?</p>

<p>The same Frank Field that put Corbyn on the ballot, sorry Frank your credibility is shot.</p>

<p>Now is not the time  MPs should be sqabbling, we need strong leadership ..Corbyn<br/>has shown intransigence when he should have gone for a free vote .He is very new to Leadership and  Parliament and maybe should have sought advice from one of the Senior Labour MP..  The Conservatives are not compus mentis in their allegiance to Cameron who sides with France , forgetting how unhelpful Hollande was in the Tunnel  problem. We really don't know how many militant illegals  got through  and are already in Britain who will strike if Britain starts bombing Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>A free vote on a critical issue is a total abrogation of leadership - so I suppose Corbyn may give one!</p>

<p>I don't think he will last long to be honest , he is I think in his 60's and made a couple of wrong moves . I think he is more at home with the Unions , but he must have wanted the job as Leader ! Ah well , we had the resignation today of one Tory for bullying and  possible sex abuse . The lad in question committed suicide , his Father says as a direct resuly of the bullying and sex. How many more names will be</p>

<p>pulled out of the hat?</p>

<p>Actually JBIRD54, Corbyn really doesn't come across as a Leader , he is too quiet.LOL</p>

<p>I,m not so sure JBIRD54, Corbyn knows he would lose so may not want to lose such an important topic, or his authority as Leader. It was known that Corbyn was a Pacifist  He got a healthy majority but if he loses authority over this important issue he will be a lame duck.</p>

<p>He HAS lost his authority as leader - and, I believe, he is therefore a lame duck. If you fail to lead on Syria - whether by having your party vote against your whip in Parliament , or by giving the pathetic rudderless compromise of a free vote - then your authority has evaporated.</p>

<p>It's early days JBIRD54, but I just posted to Sandie my misgiving about his ability to be a Leader and if he wants to calm the situation , he has to go for a Free Vote. His drawback is that he is quiet and would probably not do very well in Parliament rough and tumble.</p>

<p>Probably, he is too quiet to be a Politician , was it the Union Votes that clinched it for him.?</p>

<p>Yes JBIRD54 he has lost any semblance of Leadership , was it just the Unions who voted for him , I don't think there were many who knew of him but he did win by a healthy majority . He is not going to be a strong Leader that's for sure .</p>

<p>Everyone who knew Corbyn thought he was a very left wing who was a Pacifist  , but he still won the vote to make him Leader of the Labout Party , yet the first decision he makes  which I thought very sensible , he is shot down in flames. !!</p>

<p>Interesting. Being a pacifist (which means to me 'no war ever, about anything') is fine, of course. But it's really hard for me to see how a leader of a country under threat from terrorism can ever be a fully committed pacifist. Sometimes you just have to stand up to the threat. If Corbyn will indeed always say 'no', then I believe his support in the UK will be very low.</p>

<p>Probably JBIRD54, apparently he will give a free vote and despite the majority vote which made him Leader , I don't think he will last long, but there is no-one in the Labour Party I would consider capable of taking over.</p>
