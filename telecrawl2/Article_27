</div><p></p><p> Speaking in Malta at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, Mr Cameron said: “I believe there is a compelling case to take the effective action to keep our country safe. </p><p> “I thought many members of parliament on all sides of the House of Commons yesterday agreed there was a compelling case, so I would urge all of them to vote on the basis of the arguments for effective action on a compelling case to keep our country safe. Vote on those arguments and we can do the right thing.” </p><p> It came as the French government called on Britain to take action in Syria. Tensions also escalated over Turkey’s downing of a Russian fighter jet, with Vladimir Putin’s government imposing tough sanctions on Ankara. </p><p> Nigel Farage, the leader of the UK Independence Party which has one MP in the House of Commons, told LBC that he was not convinced by Mr Cameron's argument for bombing so-called Islamic State in Syria. </p><p style="margin-top: -20px;"></p><h3 class="was-h3"> Jeremy Corbyn's full letter to Labour MPs </h3><p></p><p> Dear Colleague, </p><p> The Prime Minister made a Statement to the House today making the case for a UK bombing campaign against ISIS in Syria. A copy of my response has already been circulated. </p><p> We have all been horrified by the despicable attacks in Paris and are determined to see the defeat of ISIS. </p><p> Our first priority must be the security of Britain and the safety of the British people. The issue now is whether what the Prime Minister is proposing strengthens, or undermines, our national security. </p><p> I do not believe that the Prime Minister today made a convincing case that extending UK bombing to Syria would meet that crucial test. Nor did it satisfactorily answer the questions raised by us and the Foreign Affairs Select Committee. </p><p> In particular, the Prime Minister did not set out a coherent strategy, coordinated through the United Nations, for the defeat of ISIS. Nor has he been able to explain what credible and acceptable ground forces could retake and hold territory freed from ISIS control by an intensified air campaign. </p><p> In my view, the Prime Minister has been unable to explain the contribution of additional UK bombing to a comprehensive negotiated political settlement of the Syrian civil war, or its likely impact on the threat of terrorist attacks in the UK. </p><p> For these and other reasons, I do not believe the Prime Minister’s current proposal for air strikes in Syria will protect our security and therefore cannot support it. </p><p> The Shadow Cabinet met today for an initial discussion and debated the issues extensively. We will meet again on Monday, when we will attempt to reach a common view. </p><p> I will get in touch again when we know the timing of the debate and vote. </p><p> Yours </p><p> Jeremy Corbyn, </p><p> Leader of the Labour Party </p><p> <iframe class="tg-card" data-id="888d48b3-d6b9-4703-bdcf-ff231e357d71" frameborder="0" height="259" id="player2" scrolling="no" src="http://cf.eip.telegraph.co.uk/breakoutCards/888d48b3-d6b9-4703-bdcf-ff231e357d71.html" style="float: left; margin: 0px 0px 10px; height: 916px;" width="540"></iframe><script src="http://cf.eip.telegraph.co.uk/assets/_scripts/embed-card.js"></script>  </p></div>
