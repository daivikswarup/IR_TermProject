<p>Simon my old muckah, if Boris Johnson were to become leader of the Conservative Party, do you think any of our newspapers would descend to such endless pathetic drivel?  The whole country knows Boris is a bumbling buffoon, the press could have an absolute field day with him - but somehow I doubt this would happen.  Do you think the Guardian would print endless daily nonsense about Boris day in day out?  No of course they wouldn't, they have a little more class and integrity.  So why is The Telegraph descending to the same level as The Sun?</p>

<p>For goodness sake - give Corbyn a break.  He's about as dangerous as a bowl of cereal.  What on earth are you so scared of?  Could it really be that the UK elite are actually scared of a little real democracy at work?</p>

<p>The reason Corbyn is not a danger to the country is because Labour, under his leadership has absolutely no chance of ever being elected. The man is an utter liability for those on the left.</p>

<p>"The reason Corbyn is not a danger to the country is because Labour, <br/>under his leadership has absolutely no chance of ever being elected"</p>

<p>Indeed, but that's not because he's a liability to the left, it's because the right wing establishment is hell bent on destroying the man on every single level it can find, plumbing the depths day after day.  Desperate drivel would be how I'd describe it.</p>

<p>You're obviously happy to believe everything you read - whether it's true or not.  Perhaps, perhaps if you just listened to Corbyn instead of allowing yourself to be another mule, perhaps you'd realise how moderate the man is.  There's nothing that Corbyn says which doesn't represent the views of a large section of the British public - that isn't extremism, it's democracy.  You might not like his politics, but many people do - that's how it works.</p>

<p>One example - the only way we brought peace to Northern Ireland was because we talked to the Republican movement.  We can thank John Major as one of the main forces behind the move to peace - certainly not Mrs Thatcher, she didn't have a moderate bone in her body.  And a hypothetical example: If Jeremy Corbyn had been our PM instead of Blair, we wouldn't have kowtowed to Bush, we wouldn't have gone into Iraq, and we wouldn't have the problems we have now.  Our EU partners warned us explicitly what would happen... but then they don't allow their countries to be run by media corporations and right wing cretins like Bush.</p>

<p>Look at the messages on ths forum, one post after another saying the same thing - that the Telegraph has become hysterical in it's tone.  Please absorb this and think about it.</p>

<p>I would defend your right to your opinion to the last.  I just don't happen to agree with it.</p>

<p>Also I don't read the daily papers and so there is little chance of them influencing my views. But I have worked at most levels and in many different types of business and organisation, I have even been a card carrying Union man (in the days of the iniquitous closed shop).</p>

<p>However I lived through the 1960s, 1970s &amp; 1980s which have had the biggest impact on my views.  Nothing was more grim than the mess this country was in by 1979.  Labour through sheer economic ignorance and incompetence made a complete mess of the economy in the mid/late 1970s. It pandered to the Unions at a time that we were lagging behind in our productivity through outdated Spanish practices.  Look at BL; it was an total basket case by 1980. I have personal experience of the behaviour of the Unions in that era which only goes to underline my point. During much of this time I was studying economics at university and I knew what the outcome was going to be long before Dennis Healey (then Chancellor of the Exchequer).</p>

<p>Labour gifted Thatcher her victories and I see an absolute parallel between Michael Foot and Jeremy Corbyn.  Both are good men who are utterly out of their depth in the job.  But most importantly neither can unite enough support to give them victory.</p>

<p>Actually I agree with most of your post Nimrod.  I was at college in London in the1970s and saw much that shaped my political views - particularly seeing the hard left up close.  However I also spent considerable time unemployed in Thatcher's vindictive and divisive 1980s.  Eventually I became self employed and have been so for over 30 years.</p>

<p>You're right to draw a parallel between Corbyn and Foot.  But most of my posts concern the Telegraph's repeated hateful and childish attacks on Jeremy Corbyn.  It doesn't say much for democracy that a supposedly respectable newspaper feels it necessary to keep printing such drivel.  Even picking "unfortunate" photographs of the man every day - how childish is that.  TheTelegraph must be desperate  - or scared.</p>

<p>PS: I'm more Ralph than Edward personally.</p>

<p>“Most newspapers would rather report, for the enlightenment<br/>of their readers, a church jumble sale than devote precious news pages to the<br/>antics of this utterly irrelevant cult.”</p>

<p>Well then why does the Telegraph publish foaming-at-the-mouth articles like this on an hourly basis?</p>

<p>“it was run by credible people who might one day sit in government – as David Cameron, William Hague and Iain Duncan Smith duly did.”</p>

<p>Credible because their views are shared by every member of the out-of-touch elite and media.</p>

<p>“I have no idea whether he knows this, but I have yet to talk to a Labour MP with a different view.”</p>

<p>How many have you spoken to? Any of the massive majority that didn't vote against Syria strikes?</p>

<p>“Even if it now has 370,000 members – half of whom appear to be malignant, Britain-hating Trotskyists who have bided their time for a political party to hijack”</p>

<p>You mean the returning Labour members who were repulsed by Blair’s full embrace of Thatcherism and Miliband's pandering to austerity?</p>

<p>“Junta”</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>“They have a long record of Jew-baiting”</p>

<p>So, that’s the kind of thing you can just say now is it? No evidence or anything.</p>

<p>“The other obvious question is this: if a man feels he must have a reshuffle every time someone disagrees with him”</p>

<p>Well, it’s a better reason than because your education secretary is so unpopular that you want to keep him out of sight for the General Election and then make him justice secretary.</p>

<p>'Labour is now mostly a front for some of the vilest and most repulsive <br/>  political movements on the planet'; Labour have become a front for the Conservatives?</p>

<p>Judging by the opinion polls, even excluding the 'Conservative voters don't tend to declare their voting intentions' factor, Labour look as though they are heading for a disaster at the local elections in May.  Corbyn will be gone before Christmas</p>

<p>We shall have to see, won't we.</p>

<p>However, if the press present only half the arguments then we will know we are in a one-party state.</p>

<p>The 'Press' do not carry the same influence as they did 20 or 50 years ago.  The fact of the matter is this is just an excuse for failure. It is a not dissimilar view to Emily Thornberry's 'Rochester man' picture. If you can't win; mock the voters but always remember the  message cannot possibly be wrong..</p>

<p>Trouble is won't the party election rules ensure a JC V2. Somehow the moderate PLP need to change the Labour Party constitution but how will that ever happen? Maybe it is time for SDP V2.</p>

<p>I think this is a case of Labour not learning from their past mistakes in the 1980s &amp; early 1990s.  The saying "history is past politics and politics present history" has never been so true as now.</p>

<p>How?  Unless he resigns the membership aren't going to vote him out are they.  Though I'm pretty sure he isn't going to want to run another full-on leadership campaign.  He's not a young man any more.</p>

<p>Falling on one's sword is the way that honourable politicians go once they realise they cannot win.  Whatever one thinks of JC I do not think he will hang around when it becomes obvious to him that he cannot win the country over.</p>

<p>The Tories will collapse first.  The austerty plan will see to that. As will th Lords, the leadership election, the EU and the attack on the Lords.</p>

<p>Plus we have NHS strikesbecause medics are sick of being attacked and taken for granted.</p>

<p>However, I fully expect the 'no taxes' righties to claim 'I pay your wages' and 'I know my rights'.</p>

<p>The problem with this argument is that it does not reflect the opinion polls.  The simple reason is that those slavishly tied to extreme left or right wing policies don't command the support of the majority of Britons.  The 1980 &amp; 90s should be a signpost to all aspiring politicians and pundits</p>

<p>If we want to see a cult we need only look at the Tories.</p>

<p>They want to suppress the Lords.<br/>Remove funding from other parties (Short funding)<br/>Suppress funding for Labour from Unions via a new law<br/>Suppress the Unions via a new law.<br/>Force medics to work 90hrs a week.</p>

<p>I don't see they suppressing funding from their donors, however.</p>

<p>Everything they do is to make them the only party.  Anyone that gets in their way is 'suppressed'.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we find out that MPs get plumb jobs, in their areas of work when MPs, when they leave.</p>

<p>Force medics to work 90hr weeks?  No idea where you got that from.  Suppressing the unions isn't a bad idea.  Consumer interest should trump producer interest every time.  And as for funding, it's a simple concept:  When you join a union you get to decide whether to give the Labour Party money.  Imagine if when I took a job there was a compulsory donation to the Tory Party from my pay packet?  Terrible.</p>

<p>As for short funding Labour really don't need the money.  All their policy research was done in the 19th century (Marx).</p>

<p>You do realise that junior medics used to work long hours?  They still do but protections were put in place.  The Government want to remove the protections so that exhaused junior  doctors have to treat patiensts.</p>

<p>Clearly, you have missed all of this because you do not care unless an exhaused medic kills your relative.</p>

<p>Consumers should always trump producers?  You are speaking of slavery.</p>

<p>The Tories want  to ensure that they get oodles of money from corporate mates so they can act as a party.  That is not democratic.  I doubt if you think so.  You are likely to be on the gravy train.</p>

<p>The Tories want to return us to Feudal times.  The 19th century would be fantstically modern.</p>

<p>What we now need is a law to massively restict donations to political parties.  Having one party get huge sums, for unknown reasons, is antidemocratic and has more in common with corrupt banana republics.</p>

<p>Excellent policies! Free Labour from union control!  Set Medics free to earn some serious money!  Limit Blair's scheme of swamping the Lords with party stooges!  Combat the Trotskyist clique which is trying to destroy British industry by union tyranny!  Free us from the supression of the brutal undemocratic mendacious Lefties!</p>

<p>Do you not remember Blair with his efforts to destroy Conservatism?</p>

<p>Free the Tories from Corporate control?</p>

<p>How is that better for democracy?</p>

<p>So jobs:  What we have is worse conditions of employment and stagnant wages (at best).</p>

<p>Zero hours contracts and the corporate abuse of 'self employment' to ensure they do not have to pay anything other than the minimum wage to their 'employees'.</p>

<p>These are the conseqences of the loss of unionisation.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Workers + Unions = Unemployment<br/>Workers - Unions = Full employment</p>

<p>Work it out.</p>

<p>You logic is not based on logic. Unless you think sweatships and slave labour are optimal.</p>

<p>I wonder if you typed the first rightwing thing that came into your head.</p>

<p>Why not?  You type all the left-wing nonsense that comes into yours.</p>

<p>70% of people on zero hours contracts prefer them.  Only a small percentage of overall employment is zero hours.</p>

<p>Pay is rising now.  Most new jobs are full time employed, not self-employed.</p>

<p>Where did you getthat 70% from?</p>

<p>I do wonder what country you are living in.</p>

<p>He and his fellow leftist travelers are a great example on why it is best to just tune out the left 99.9% of the time on everything. Could he secretly be a Tory, working to make Labour as unelectable as possible, or is Labour just monumentally naive and stupid about domestic and world affairs?</p>

<p>Corbyn must be scratching his ar$e wondering how the hell Hilary Benn got the better of him..</p>

<p>Keep your friends close but you enemies closer.</p>

<p>Corbyn has no regard for the culture, traditions and constitution of this country and it is clear he wants it to be very different in future. </p>

<p>We used to have a tradition of jobs for our people but the Tories and their mates export them to countries like China.</p>

<p>They lost their jobs because they followed people like Red Robbo.</p>

<p>The lost their jobs because they could make more profit exploiting sweatshop workers.</p>

<p>When your jobs goes, will you blame the unions as well?</p>

<p>Those "sweatshop workers" aren't being exploited.  They're being paid for a day's work when the alternative for them is starvation.  You probably haven't done a survey of them yourself, have you.  Most of them are probably grateful for any employment.</p>

<p>You're also missing the key point:  World poverty is falling.  It's been falling for decades.  It's falling because of free trade and neoliberal economic policy.</p>

<p>The Germans and the Japanese could do it, even using British labour, as long as they got rid of Red Robbo and his chums.  Red Robbo exported their jobs for them.</p>

<p>I am retired. I can blame the Unions as much as I like.</p>

<p>I think Corbyn has a whacking great inferiority complex... what on earth has he been doing all these years  besides picking up his MP's salary ..</p>

<p>I dare say he has been leading a life of Riley, freebies and fact finding overseas trips etc etc.. he has found time to get married three times, because he could afford to do so, but at the same time stuck in his  Marxist groove  which reminds him of his youth and rebellious , long haired ,flared trouser period..</p>

<p>What a silly old git he sounds...</p>

<p>He has been representing his constituency.  They keep asking him back so he must be doing something good.</p>

<p>You can dare say whatyou like but we we want to look at 'creative expenses' I am sure you will change the subject very quickly when we ask about the Tories.</p>

<p>Also, what is with the agism?  If not for the 'old gits' the Tories wouldn't get any votes.</p>

<p>His constituency isn't representative of us in the shires... He has lots of champagne socialists and other varieties  of a very leftist leaning... many with inferiority complexes / those who belong to an envy cult/ those who despise Britain and want to do it down!</p>

<p>So, do you now retract your point about him not doing anything all these years besides picking up his MP's salary? You seem to have changed points completely...unless you can explain how your second point relates at all to your first? Or did you just realise your point was indefensible and change tack?</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>Well, I didn't have high hopes for your response: Someone refuted your original point, you didn't even bother to try and defend it but switched to something completely different - obviously because your original point was entirely baseless and made without analysis or evidence.</p>

<p>Harold Macmillian, a one nation Conservative, (not the extreme Right wing divisive Tories that are so very common nowadays) said 'Politics, is shaped by events, dear boy' Events!'. They are not shaped by the very narrow and regular view presented by this  and other Torygraph journalists. THe Labour Party in his view are written off as 'malignant Britain hating Trotsyites, I'd imagine also the 30-40% of the population who regularly vote for them either fall into this bracket or are deluded. In his opinon I expect most of Scotland, France, Canada and Scandivania, who have socialist governents would be described the same. What objectivity! it's like describing every Tory as a Pinochet supporting, self-serviing, heartless robot, who know the price of everything, but the value of none.If this man is so unelectable, why so many articles attacking his unelectability? Surely he's therfore no threat to the current establishment?</p>

<p>Scandinavia, yes Sweden is a great success with welcoming shed loads of Muslim immigrants. That is if one defines success as moving from being a First World country to a Third World country.</p>

<p>Yes Scandivania is a great success despite being a series of nations of  maligant Trotskyite anti-patriots! Probably why so many Muslims want to go there, despite the weather. Thanks for agreeing, aren't they envisioning a 4 day working week?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>The neo liberals wreck the planet's economy amd you moan about socialists?</p>

<p>Very odd.</p>

<p>Some people can't distinguish socialism from 'liberalism' and political correctness. It's a very facile argument indeed saying socialists are conspiring a new underclass of immigrants. Putin might be defined as 'socialist' but he takes a very harsh stance on immigration, as do many Russians. Some Tories are very politicaly correct too advocating an increase on the foreign aid budget, while allowing savage cuts on the indegenous population.</p>

<p>Proletariat hmm, someone's been reading a bit too much George Orwell.!Muslims, with their Conservative views have more in common with The Far Right.</p>

<p>Getting on for 2,000 anti Corbyn articles,  hundreds of silly photos and Heifer writes 'Happily,  we need not concern ourselves. ' in a twelve paragraph article explaining how the Labour Party don't matter.  I think my neighbour isn't a threat.  I wouldn't spend a fortune or the energy trying desperately to prove it.  </p>

<p>I approach the matter as one who until a decade and a half ago was firmly of the Right.</p>

<p>Gradually, my thinking has changed drastically. I had strong aversion to Labour when Kinnock (a buffoon and less couth version of Boris Johnson) and Blair (I deemed him innately wicked as soon as he came to my attention) were party leaders. The Blair/Brown era was distinguished by having some of the most blatantly corrupt (moving in and out of office by revolving door) or meretricious government ministers of the post-WW2 period. Sadly, yet not unexpectedly, neither of the two governments post-Brown are exemplars of good-sense, vision, rectitude and concern for the well-being of ordinary people.</p>

<p>It was the run up to the 2008 financial collapse and the incompetent manner by which it was handled in the USA and UK that confirmed suspicions that market-capitalism was moribund and that this state had been hastened by 'deregulation' in the '80s. Thereupon, I took keen interest in non-conventional economic theory.</p>

<p>A salient feature, sadly ill-considered by politicians, of this 21st century is that it differs <i>qualitatively</i> from everything previously. The opportunities offered and challenges posed cannot be met by political, economic, and social values rooted in the 19th century and beyond.</p>

<p>Thus, to me, the concept of a political spectrum from Left to Right has become anachronistic. Indeed, solutions to pressing problems, e.g. restoring market-capitalism as a mechanism serving humanity rather than the other way around, must come from imaginative people across the alleged spectrum. No longer must always partly artificial and now wholly redundant labels (Left, Right etc) constrain imagination and prevent constructive dialogue over where we as a nation seek to go and how we should contribute to helping the world as whole grasp current opportunities.</p>

<p>In that context I welcome Mr Corbyn. I hope he can deliver on his promises with respect to the Labour Party: essentially, genuine membership participation. I hope he will foster radical discussion of economics, foreign policy, societal values, and so forth; let there be no 'sacred cows' - either of Left or Right - untouched in debate. Neither the Lib/Dem leaders nor Conservatives leaders are up to the job of grasping the true import of this 21st century. That is not to say, members and MPs of other political parties lack the ability, merely the will at present. Maybe political realignments shall occur.</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn must be on to something. Else why all the vitriolic attacks upon him through media supporting the unsustainable <i>status quo</i>?</p>

<p>.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Every word true.</p>

<p>I will try to put it simpler in the hope others will understand what you've said better on a second reading - we need to all work together for the common good and get rid of this party political and left v right obsession altogether - neither the left nor the right are right about everything, we need to take the good and valuable from both sides, or as you put it, all parts of the spectrum, and base our society and economy on commonsense and not minority interest and out and out greed.</p>

<p>The problem is that the top 1% or 5% are defending a system that works well only for them, but not for everybody else.</p>

<p>I would love to see something different. Ministers of both parties have been entirely interchangeable as long as I can remember. Corbyn has to accept that new boundary changes and the UK's banana republic voting system will likely prevent that much needed change, however.</p>

<p>It has been reported that emily thornberry has pocketed £14,500 from a firm of solicitors who are hounding some of our forces who went to war on this country's behalf. If Corbyn wins an election she could be the next Defence Minister and that is a prospect even the most loyal labour voters should not tolerate..</p>

<p>You don't understand how law works. Nobody is immoral in the law world, because the only arbiter of right and wrong is the verdict.</p>

<p>Someone who claims they are an honourary Leiutenant Colonel when they are not is immoral, even if it is in the "law world"</p>

<p>When both the Labour Establishment and all Tories together are making persistent and venomous attacks on Jeremy Corbyn this must give us pause to surmise why this is so.</p>

<p>It may seem surprising that when seeing the Corbyn phenomenon the Tories such as Mr Simon Heffer find themselves speaking up in the defence of what is called on the Westminster stage "the Opposition".</p>

<p>"I salute the brave people who resigned last week rather than bear any more of this nonsense....(of Mr Corbyn's conduct) ."     [Simon Heffer, Sunday 10th January 2016, Telegraph].</p>

<p>Before I offer my guess on the reason for the solidarity - solidarność - between the Right of the Labour Party and the Right which is the Conservative party I state with no agenda that I support neither Tweedle-dum nor Tweedle-dee , nor Mr Corbyn and his followers, nor am I of the left.</p>

<p>In the well-trodden rutted path followed by our political castes they jog along comfortably and successively to share out the loot when taking turns in power to serve themselves and those who fund them to get there. It is the reason, I put it, why "I have done nothing wrong" when a Member of Parliament who shares in the trough is found wanting is rarely challenged at all never mind overturned. And if challenged the network of the "nomenklatura" of both our ruling parties will see that a "safe pair of hands" is selected to run the investigation.</p>

<p>It would be disastrous if the game were overturned by a maverick simple-mindedly honest intruder as the ruling caste see it. So forget the display of contention: fight together to stop the one who has never shared in the high rewards of office. He might benightedly not follow the rules!</p>

<p>Has anyone a better explanation?</p>

<p>Very well put.</p>

<p>I did a check on your contributions and I quote:</p>

<p>"It was the run up to the 2008 financial collapse and the incompetent manner by which it was handled in the USA and UK that confirmed suspicions that market-capitalism was moribund and that this state had been hastened by 'deregulation' in the '80s. Thereupon, I took keen interest in non-conventional economic theory."</p>

<p>I recommend a reading of the work of Michael Hudson. He is an American so I think hardly of the "Left". If he were he would be disregarded by our political castes, as was Marriner Stoddard Eccles; he, though politically a Republican gave an analysis and "pragmatically" offered a solution to the Great Depression which anticipated Keynes.</p>

<p>Labour has been a convenient 'front' for jihadists for years, even before the war-criminal Blair utterly corrupted the postal-vote system to favour the RoP 'voters'</p>

<p>Corbyn will always be an irrelevant   'cult'</p>

<p>Shouldn't the headline be...</p>

<p>Labour's Corbyn is now an irrelevant </p>

<p>Corbyn's natural instinct and that of his ilk, is to support anyone who hates and opposes the west, such as terrorists, Putin and various other dictators; and to recoil from defending Britain and its people. UKIP and the Conservatives will gleefully gather up Labour votes in 2020. It is in the interests of British democracy that decent moderate left of centre people regain control of the party and expel the Stalinist, Trotsykist rabble that have infested it  - and I speak as a Conservative voter!</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Spelling not your strong point? :)</p>

<p>As a Labour supporter I have to agree with Heff, although I never thought I would say that. It would be good to debate the issue but the comments in this newspaper are now mainly  at gutter level, from both sides, that it's not worth the trouble.</p>

<p>To judge from the avid trolling on here, Corbyn has two followers.  That's all.</p>

<p>Or possibly one follower with two forum logins....</p>

<p>Oooh. Mustn't have any different opinions here. This is the DT,their way or the highway : ))</p>

<p>It isn't a matter of different opinions, it is trolling - dogging every post with meaningless insult with the intention of creating an argument rather than a discussion.  The intellectual content of a troll post is nil, and the provocation is 100%.  The result is a torrent of tedious, witless jibes that diminish the quality of the board.  You seem happy to count yourself as one of these idiots, since your post contains no discussion, but only sarcasm. "HaHa" indeed!</p>

<p>At least some right wingers can see through this silly game. The DT though, will keep spoonfeeding its disciples who will lap it up HaHa : ))</p>

<p></p>

<p>Basically, we aren't an extremist nation - we tend to find extremism rather comic, if anything, as people such as Mosley found out.<br/>No-one will care much about Corbyn until the next election, when he will probably get about 3 votes. Good thing we keep the first-past-the-post system here - it keeps the weirdo wannabes out.</p>

<p>It wasn't successful last year though, was it?</p>

<p>It was successful enough to keep the nut jobs in opposition. Try and keep up</p>

<p>It was enough to keep the rabid nut jobs in opposition. Try and keep up dear boy</p>

<p>It was perfectly successful thank you.</p>

<p>Keeps the Europhile, Islamophile, Britain-hating Tory party in power though.</p>

<p>If it wasn't for the state broadcaster it would be buried</p>

<p>Labour are pure evil.</p>

<p>Sadly, they aren't. For proper evil just see what ham-chops Dave is up to.</p>

<p>Thank you, Piglet.</p>

<p>There's nothing pure about Labour.</p>

<p>and filth.</p>

<p>Fact remains that with over 4 years to go before the next GE, there is lots of time before these Internal Labour Wars finish playing out, and they finally surface with what they "now" put forward as long term Labour Party Philosophy.</p>

<p>Until they do, Labour are Toast at a GE - already its 2025 at the earliest before they get a look-in. 2020 is Fantasy Land; even the Labour Left themselves acknowledge that .... likely 2030 before any serious attempt is possible once they make up their mind who replaces Corbyn for the attempt.</p>

<p>Until then ..... go find a pastime to occupy the mind, because this silly Internal War has lots of legs left yet before they stop stabbing each other, and we find out what the Party will stand for over the next few Decades. Right now its just silly Internal Wars; with vacant jabbering and silly inane vacant sniping; as the Internal Politics and Ego dribble plays out..</p>

<p>Spot on Simon, once again.</p>

<p>Oink</p>

<p>Yes, I can see by your...er....'contribution' that you must be one of those Lefty intellectuals..</p>

<p>Over on the NYT  on the destruction of Europe. It makes the point re Germany that the Liberal elite claim that I million "refugees" in a population of 80 million is not such a problem is a terrible lie. It points out that 95% of that million are twenty something males &amp; that the equivalent number of Germans is less than ten million. The million will soon be bringing in their extended families &amp; then breeding big time, propped up by German welfare. Within ten years Germans of child rearing age will be a minority &amp; the future population will be overwhelmingly non German &amp; Muslim</p>

<p>Don't think that this wont happen in the UK, it's just not as open and obvious.</p>

<p>However, Germany has a pensions crisis looming.  They do not have enough young people to pay the pensions of the Boomers and Gen-X lot coming behind them.</p>

<p>They need the young and their kids.</p>

<p><i>Or</i> they could make a few adjustments to their pensions system. That's a bit more appropriate than erasing the national identity and culture of an entire country overnight, just to address an issue of demographics.</p>

<p>The incomers unfortunately won't contribute anything. The Turks have been there for decades and still haven't integrated or played a major role in the economy.</p>

<p>The usual lie. They will get young &amp; old &amp; sick &amp; feckless<br/>Technology will look after the old in first world economies. Unfortunately Germany is not likely to remain a first world economy if it continues along the current suicide track</p>

<p>Not according to this report from the Express:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/603870/Migrant-crisis-graphs-Germany-needs-more-migrants-than-Britain" rel="nofollow">http://www.express.co.uk/news/...</a></p>

<p>That's a first. You quoting the Express as an organ of factual reporting.</p>

<p>I thought it was amusing to do so.  I could not be claimed to be quoting from Marxist publications if I did.</p>

<p>Well it amused me</p>

<p>The nation has only a passing interest at the moment, in the lead up to a general election it will be a different matter. An ambulance chasing lawyer as shadow minister of defence is a joke, the prospect of her being our actual defence minister in itself is enough to lose an election.</p>

<p>A 'passing interest' lol</p>

<p>They do, people get much more worked up about Van Gaal or Kates Birthday at the moment, there isnt an election so it isnt relevant apart from to DT hacks the westminster bubble and people who comment here, that is a small part of the population.</p>

<p>I never thought Hattie could be made to seem in touch with working Britain by comparison</p>

<p>I don't agree with some of what Corbyn says but he frequently makes a lot of sense. <br/>You see, I'd love to believe in what Cameron believes, but given that his beliefs seem to change with every with new gust of wind it makes it very difficult.</p>

<p>Hmm., your so called "man of principle" has made several U-turns since he was so puzzlingly voted in as leader of the communism-lite party.</p>

<p>The National Anthem debacle.</p>

<p>Trident.</p>

<p>The European Union.</p>

<p>His image.</p>

<p>Appointment to the Privy Council.</p>

<p>Air strikes in Syria.</p>

<p>A U-turn on the party's support for the Tories' fiscal charter, which commits the government to operating a budget surplus and another U-turn back (I think - its hard to tell with Corbyn and his divided party and shadow cabinet spinning policy so rapidly as <em>"his beliefs seem to change with every with new gust of wind it makes it very difficult.</em> ).</p>

<p>'...makes a lot of sense..' tee hee....er....when exactly..</p>

<p>Corbyn has principles, many of which are supported by a majority of people. Cameron has no principles whatsoever and spreads himself so thinly over vast swathes of ideology he makes superficial Blair look like a profound political thinker</p>

<p>Unfortunately Corbyn's "principles" are so evil and demented, the vast majority of people will vote for Dave now. Corbyn is making it easy for the Tories. It's Michael Foot to the power ten. Labour will be down to less than 100 seats in 2020.</p>

<p>I recently found some minutes of a meeting from No.10 thrown on a tip:<br/>Cameron: So, what's on the agenda today?<br/>Advisor: Well PM, there's the fracking laws.<br/>C: Ah yes, we don't like fracking, do we?<br/>A: Yes, PM. We've ditched the support for the sustainable energy industries.<br/>C: Really?<br/>A: Yes. Fracking companies donate a lot more to our coffers than that green crap ever did. Plus we can make some of them peers at some point soon to help push our reactionary, fag-packet policies through the Upper House.<br/>C: Ah, the Upper House. I won't be reforming that, as I said at the election.<br/>A: No, PM. You are reforming it.<br/>C: Am I?<br/>A: Yes. Because the peers weren't happy at a policy that wasn't even in our worthless manifesto.<br/>C: Ah, ok. Jolly good. Anything else?<br/>A: Yes. What do you feel like thinking today?<br/>C: Hmmm, good question. I have some frankly appalling policies to announce later. Shall we attack Jeremy Corbyn as a distraction?<br/>A: Excellent idea.<br/>C: Or I can see which way the wind's blowing first...<br/>A: No, that's fine. Tea, Dave?</p>

<p>Evil? Perhaps you could enlighten us.</p>

<p>They didn't in the GE or in Oldham.</p>

<p>Corbyn is only painted as 'evil' by those that have the most to lose from the derailing of the gravy train.</p>

<p>Those that are not benefiting from this but still support the Tories are 'a bit dim'.</p>

<p>The sort of people that vote for the party of cuts and then whonder why their services have been cut.  Or, why the flood defences never got built or maintained in Tory areas (Carlisle and N. Yorkshire for example).</p>

<p>One of the reasons we had bad floods now is because farming practices make it more likely.  The Tory solution? Pay farmers to let their lands flood when there are floods.  Anyone else smell fish?</p>

<p>Corbyn is a silly old duffer in 5 years time his brains will be minced.</p>

<p>Don't exaggerate. From his recent performances - what brain he ever had is already "minced"...</p>

<p>I know, I cant wait to see him run an election campaign.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see him "run" anything with both feet so often firmly planted in his mouth and his party and the shadow cabinet's feet so often kicking him from behind.</p>

<p>He looks a lot like Worzel Gummage - I only hope he has a "thinking head" like dear old Worzel.</p>

<p>Whereas Cameron is the vibrant, trusting face of youth. And he even interferes with dead pigs to prove it!</p>

<p>You should keep your mouth closed next time, Piglet.</p>

<p>well argued.</p>

<p>So you advocate the removal of voting rights for the elderly because they are 'old and useless'?</p>

<p>That would be consistant with your position.</p>

<p>It would, also, damage the main Tory voters: 'Old Duffers'...</p>

<p>Did I say that?  An 80 year old can choose which driver he thinks will win formula 1 but he cannot compete at formula one himself. Leading the opposition and running the country are extremely highly stressed, he will have a brain fade or Mrs Duffy moment probably lots of them.</p>

<p>So you think old people are a bit slow so you?  A bit past it and useless?  A bit lacking, intellectually?</p>

<p>So should we stop them from having a vote?  After all, 16yr olds have been denied this due to their age.</p>

<p>You said that, now are you going to do anything more than your usual idiotic virtue signalling by having a debate with yourself?</p>

<p>It was not me that was using phrases like 'old duffer'.  That implies that you have an opinion regarding old people that links age to intellectual capacity.</p>

<p>All yours that is...</p>

<p>He is an old duffer, he has never led anything until the age of 65 and now is being proposed as the country's leader when he will be 70. His only experience of government is voting against it, be it Labour or conservative or coalition.</p>

<p>Principles - yes, of course he has....that's why he sacked Ole Hilary....tee hee..</p>

<p>Every principle he has boasted of has been ditched in favour of staying in power as leader, typical Marxist.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>well argued.</p>

<p>If you could point out to me where he has contravened any rules as leader of the Labour party and acted in anyway different to any opposition leader in the past, that would be helpful.</p>

<p>Impersonating Albert Steptoe at a memorial service to war veterans in a Cathedral.</p>

<p>It would be nice if the Tories reverse all their cuts to the armed services so they don't have to go to war with inadequate kit and equipment.</p>

<p>In addition, being short of personnel doesn't help.  Nor does getting your redundancy from the Tories when on the front line.</p>

<p>I don't know how Tory MPs dare go to verteran sessions with such a history.</p>

<p>Both parties have cut the armed forces and over used them, I doubt they are much use at all anymore to be honest.</p>

<p>Not massively cut them like the Tories have.</p>

<p>Massively.</p>

<p>They were cut by all parties, Blair cut the armed forces while they were fighting his war with dubya.</p>

<p>Tee hee</p>

<p>Well, if you include Hamas, Cage and the IRA..</p>

<p>Screaming Lord Sutch was the same, good for a laugh no prospect of being PM.</p>

<p>I don't recall ten separate comment pieces in one day in the Telegraph all questioning the electoral prospects of Lord Sutch though.</p>

<p>You seem to forget that he is leader of the opposition, his re shuffle putting anti Trident nobodies in key positions is news, it is unprescedented in British history to have such a pacifist stance. The in fighting in the Labour party is news that is why it is covered. I look forward to them getting trounced and then these idiots wont be news any more.</p>

<p>Yes, I notice your stance on reshuffles and leaders attempting to find some unity within the ranks.</p>

<p>Corbyn on Syria - Stalinist dictator</p>

<p>Cameron on EU rebels - Tactical genius</p>

<p>I have never made a comment on Cameron and the EU,  Corbyn is more like Mao than Stalin.</p>

<p>But it is Cameron that is handing over our power to the communists and it is righties that have closed our businesses so chinese sweatshop workers can do it while our people get dumped on the dole.</p>

<p>He does more for the communists than he does for us!</p>

<p>get real, I am 55 and we had cheap imports from hong kong when I was a child.  All the major parties are pro immigration and globalist.</p>

<p>Really? How so? And I would also like your opinion on how both leaders have differed on establishing unity within their parties.</p>

<p>why?</p>

<p>It's time for the Labour moderates to break away and form a new party. Maybe it should be called "The Parliamentary Labour Party".</p>

<p>And who would be their constituency when it came to election time?</p>

<p>'Tory lite' perhaps?</p>

<p>Good article. Corbyn and the loony left really belong in some kind of asylum, or is that what the Labour party is?</p>

<p>When are you joining the panel on Question Time?</p>

<p>Corbyn's election was great.., for the tories...</p>

<p>Good old communism-lite - same old, <em>same old</em> delusional and class war hysterical Labour promising to tax us to extinction and take everything into "public" ownership while big state nannyism runs riot steamrolling over personal freedoms and the greater good of the nation.</p>

<p>Three cheers for JC. Long may he reign and keep the unelectable completely unelectable.</p>

<p>Obviously state ownership of British industries is fine - as long as it's foreign-owned.  Privatisation of the railways was and is an absolute joke.<br/>Then there's the water utilities, the energy companies...</p>

<p>Your naive fanaticism continues to leak into this comment column, Shelly.</p>

<p>Always glad to be of service.  And your pathetic generalisations, based entirely on baseless scaremongering, continue to cause hilarity and gasps of incredulity.</p>

<p>Denial is not rebuttal.<br/>Your attempted ad hominem is the sign of a lost argument.</p>

<p>I feel for you in your humiliation, my ignorant and delusional friend.</p>

<p>I'm ad hominem-ing, apparently, and then you go on to call me ignorant and delusional? Oh dear. Better luck next time, Obo.</p>

<p>You obviously don't remember British rail then..</p>

<p>What a knock down argument.</p>

<p>Not in great detail, no. But I started using the trains regularly a couple of years after privatisation and what a joy it was to see my train not bothering to stop at my station again and again in order to make up the time elsewhere, just so the targets could be claimed to have been met.</p>

<p>Do tell us the "everything" he intends to take into  "public ownership". I can't wait for this answer : ))</p>

<p>Good question moncky.</p>

<p>It provokes one to contemplate all the British industries that were run into the ground under past disastrous Labour regimes.</p>

<p>It's always worth remembering that at the time the UK was known as the "sick man of Europe" under the Wilson/Unions dictatorship - more coal mines were closed than during the whole of the curative Thatcher years.</p>

<p>It's also worth remembering that no Labour government has ever left the nation's finances better than when they came into office and few have managed to leave them as good.</p>

<p>Which "failing industries" do you consider could be improved by applying the heavy handed bureaucracy and <em>borrow, tax and spend spend spend!</em> ideology of communism-lite labour mismanagement?</p>

<p>I thought Corbyn had said he'd renationalise the trains and a couple of other failing industries? Good for him. That does not equate to 'everything'. No attempt to analyse the failings of privatisation?</p>

<p>You're right to ask this question, Shelly.</p>

<p>It provokes one to contemplate all the British industries that were run into the ground under past disastrous Labour regimes.</p>

<p>It's always worth remembering that at the time the UK was known as the "sick man of Europe" under the Wilson/Unions dictatorship - more coal mines were closed than during the whole of the curative Thatcher years.</p>

<p>It's also worth remembering that no Labour government has ever left the nation's finances better than when they came into office and few have managed to leave them as good.</p>

<p>By what measure do you consider UK railway businesses to be "failing" and which other "failing industries" do you consider could be improved by applying the heavy handed bureaucracy and <em>borrow, tax and spend spend spend!</em> ideology of communism-lite labour mismanagement?</p>

<p>Yes, communism-lite, clearly. Your scaremongering is strong today, Obo.<br/>Your defence of rail privatisation is touching; totally delusional, but touching. What next, will you defend water privatisation? (I've asked a company three hundred miles away to provide me with my water, but they are stubbornly refusing to do so.)</p>

<p>Quite. Yesterday there were six and the day before that, ten articles in the comment section all tearing apart the 'irrelevant, unelectable' bearded one.<br/></p>

<p>Interesting media reaction to both leaders as they look to strike some consistency of opinion within their respective parties.</p>

<p>Corbyn on members supporting bombing - Stalinist dictator</p>

<p>Cameron on Brexiters - Tactical masterstroke</p>

<p>Well, you've certainly got Corbyn's trolls foaming at the mouth, Simon.  Well done sir.</p>

<p>May as well give up in the face of such searingly insightful commentary.</p>

<p>Who's foaming at the mouth? No one. Apart from Heffer. If anything I'm laughing. Laughing at Heffer's attempts at journalism.</p>

<p>'highly damaging to British interests.'</p>

<p>It's their motto, and forms an (almost) one sentence Manifesto.</p>

<p>It's whose motto?</p>

<p>I haven't found any article or any writer who has favorably written about<br/>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. It has been doom and gloom ominous<br/>predictions, and they are just reasonable and accurate, based on current<br/>developments. This is all because of Corbyn's dogged determination <br/>to lambast, antagonize or punish opposition within Labour ranks.</p>

<p>Corbyn is not acting or behaving like he has any intention of winning the<br/>general election or any general election. Labour is losing any mark of<br/>being a viable opposition party. It's looking more like a rump of a remnant<br/>of a political party. This is the point Simon Heffer is making in his article<br/>where he has more vigorously outlined, expressed and analyzed these<br/>trends.</p>

<p>There are no plans in the works to rebuild Labour from bottoms up--for<br/>now. That responsibility doesn't seem to fall upon Jeremy Corbyn or occur<br/>to him. I asked of the unions. They are part of the reason Labour is in this<br/>kind of miserable, desperate, regrettable position now. And, what I, also,<br/>haven't seen, is anybody predicting the possibility of Corbyn becoming<br/>the prime minister any day.</p>

<p>Simon Heffer's article pressed on that issue, also: There are no indications<br/>suggesting that Corbyn can become the prime minister. Neither is he<br/>attracting voters, especially younger voters, to building a constituency that<br/>can create a robust, viable, alternative Labour Party that can win in a<br/>general election. Perhaps, London constituencies are an exception. But,<br/>it's been a traditional Labour stronghold. Where Labour needs expansion<br/>in places like Scotland, it's not growing. Labour could be facing another<br/>rout in Scotland election this May. Corbynism is not helping.<br/>Igonikon Jack, USA</p>

<p>No London has NOT been a traditional Labour stronghold, since the creation of the GLC in the 1970s. You are just repeating a canard you have read, without having any real knowledge of the situation.<br/>Under the GLC, who ran London was on a knife-edge. The Tories won equally as often as Labour. Since the introduction of a London mayor, Livingstone won first as an independent. He secure a second term as the Labour candidate. Since then we have had two terms of the Conservative, Boris Johnson. <br/>Where is the evidence London is a 'traditional Labour stronghold'?</p>

<p>Jack has certain fixed ideas about the UK.</p>

<p>He has a particular down on Corbyn and trades unions and comes onto the DT daily, denigrating all aspects of Britain.</p>

<p>A VERY high proportion of what he writes is copied and pasted from random sources and is generally careless and often filled with error and untruths.</p>

<p>He lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana and has never even visited Britain.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know he's a nutcase and normally I ignore him, but I didn't want that nonsense about London to go unchallenged, as I've seen it repeated more than once by lazy commentators who should know better.</p>

<p>He actually believes he has a huge international following, so challenging his garbage at least warns anyone reading it that it is not to be trusted.</p>

<p>More power to your elbow.</p>

<p>It will be interesting to see if he deigns to reply to you.</p>

<p>Thank you; I hope not!</p>

<p>Yet more mindless tribalism masquerading as objective commentary.</p>

<p>Corbyn has many faults, but most of the press would sooner attack him for whatever reason that look at what the government is doing. That 'bow' story. Seriously? Utterly, utterly pathetic.</p>

<p>And it needs to remain an irrelevant cult. <br/>These bottom feeding parasites would destroy what little remains of a once great country. I don't have any use for political parties, but labour, are far beyond the bottom of the barrel.</p>

<p>Incredible commentary. It must be awful being faced with notions such as equality, tax collection and dignity.</p>

<p>Insightful stuff. Thanks.</p>

<p>Indeed!</p>

<p>Because the only political alternatives in the UK are Tory hegemony or the North Korean model.</p>

<p>So irrelevant that the ridiculous Torygraph feels disposed to publish a dozen or so hysterical attack pieces about it every day!</p>

<p>Such columns attract readers and increased circulation supports new advertising revenue which is why these titles exist.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Well he seems to have attracted you for some reason.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Yes, as long as there is ABC circulation, there is a case for advertising revenue.</p>

<p>Come on, when I see Heffer's hysterical ramblings how can I not have a read?</p>

<p>Yes but whatever views you and I may have, we are both simply statistics which are used to fuel Powerpoint presentations.</p>

<p>The Torygraph's circulation is on a one-way journey to the basement - less than that of The Times for the first time in donkeys years.</p>

<p>Yes indeed - it is simply not financially viable to try to run a paper title any more.</p>

<p>Although the small rump of followers of the now permanently defunct Labour party always denies it, and who could blame them, every Labour government since the war has returned the British economy to an inheriting Conservative government, in tatters.</p>

<p>Conversely, although there has been one Conservative government in that time who was ejected with the economy in a worse state than that which they inherited, there was only one.</p>

<p>That Conservative government was lead by the wretched  Edward Heath.</p>

<p>Remind me again which party presided over double digit interest rates and an ignominious exit from the ERM?</p>

<p>I think you should read one of the many books available about the almost miraculous economic recovery ironically achieved directly as a result of rejection from the exchange mechanism and the we can discuss it if you like.</p>

<p>are you aware of the status of the UK's current account deficit which if I'm not mistaken is the second worst in the developed world?</p>

<p>Firstly you are not correct in that and secondly the reasons are not too difficult to establish.</p>

<p>As I have said before, there has only ever been one Conservative government since the war which has been ejected with an economy in a worse shape than it inherited but conversely every Labour government since the war has been ejected with the economy in tatters.</p>

<p>All the Tories ever do is to clear up and I can assure you that I am no great admirer of the Conservative party any more..</p>

<p>Under Corbyn, it would be rated the worst. So, what's your point?</p>

<p>You have no way of knowing that. Why not look at the record of the Tories on the economy instead? After all, it is appalling.</p>

<p>Try telling that to the voters of Oldham, Simon. This sham of a Labour party has nothing in common with the true Labour party of Wilson, Callahan, Healey etc, who my father and grandfather, along with millions of working class people supported all their lives. Whatever faults those afore-mentioned Labour politicians had, they were patriotic and were motivated by a genuine desire to improve life for the working class, not by a hatred of Britain, as is now the case. None of this seems to penetrate into some people's heads however, regardless of ample evidence out there, as demonstrated by the recent Oldham by-election. There are still millions of them out there saying "I'll always vote Labour cos they look after the working man don't they?" As someone once observed, some people will vote for a donkey as long as it has a red rosette on it.</p>

<p>I am well aware of the pro Tory influence in the MSM. However, as for unquestioning support from their voters, UKIP got more than 3.8 million votes in the last election, many I would guess, are ex- Tory voters disillusioned with what has become of that party. Now if we could just get the tribal Labour voters to throw off their blinkers and throw their support behind them instead of wasting their vote on a party made up of people who despise them, we might get a more representative Westminster.</p>

<p>This is quite hilarious in its blinkered partisanship.</p>

<p>Of course it's only the Labour party that inspire such unquestioning support. Have you ever watched a Conservative party conference? Are you even aware that 90% of the UK's print media is pro Conservative?</p>

<p>oldham is far from representative. the MP is a well liked local man and a moderate not remotely a loony lefty. the way things are going by 2020 there will be no moderates left to vote for.</p>

<p>I've just google'd Jim Mcmahon, seems a genuine, decent bloke. How long before the party commisars decide he is no longer suitable?</p>

<p>Votes should be given based on the party you want to see in Government, not how nice your local MP is. I couldn't give a **** if my local Labour MP was a living saint if it helps Corbyn and his band of loonies get into power.</p>

<p>Corbyn is a small and embarrassing sideshow. He had nothing to do with the death of the Labour Party.</p>

<p>The final demise of Labour happened the day they inserted Miliband  as leader.</p>

<p>Labour will never return as a viable political force in Britain.</p>

<p>on the contrary it is corbyn who is single handedly destroying the party. miliband was not popular but he was not a pacifist and he was not a marxist.</p>

<p>Nice chap in real life too, I have met him a couple of times.</p>

<p>No one who shafts their own brother like that is a nice chap.</p>

<p>The unions shafted David, not Ed.</p>

<p>They both did however the unions are not his brother. </p>

<p>Ed Shafted David by standing against him for the leadership.</p>

<p>We can play ping pong with this one all day. It is not interesting enough for me to develop.</p>

<p>Leftie trolls out in force today.</p>

<p>Heffer was correct about Corbyn but got one thing wrong: the electorate is now so dim that Corbyn could win in 2020.</p>

<p>Can't face looking at Cameron's many mistakes? </p>

<p>They are not dim - but what chance do they have with the BBC pouring out their distorted version of the truth 24 hours a day?</p>

<p>The electorate rose above such things in the last general election and as usual, made the correct call.</p>

<p>Having trouble defending your ill informed opinions?</p>

<p>the electorate is not dim and they will never elect corbyn. it is totally out of the question.</p>

<p>If he's so utterly unelectable why is the right-wing press and many people on here totally obsessed by him?</p>

<p>Your logic is faulty.</p>

<p>Please explain.</p>

<p>So are Cameron's Tories. The political class are now so far removed from reality that none of the main parties are any use whatsoever. They have ruined the economy, and they do nothing to fix it. They have imposed a demographic crisis on Europe and are committed to making it worse. They have wrecked our civil liberties and imposed the rule of quangocrats whose reward for failure is another, better job running another Quango. They have made elections irrelevant. They despise us.</p>

<p>Corbyn is an ideologically driven fool who can bring nothing but ruin. But so are the other parties. With the failure of the model of using The City to fund an ever expanding State, and a super-rich class served by brown people from abroad, they have no answers. Cameron fiddles in Europe over trivia about benefits for migrants, while the real issues receive no answers.</p>

<p>The people of Britain, and peoples of Europe in general, are at an historical juncture of supreme importance. Politics as usual is not an option.</p>

<p>the economy is doing very well. it is now the leading economy in europe.</p>

<p>Considering the state of the Eurozone it's not quite the achievement it seems</p>

<p>Considering the state of the Eurozone it's an astounding achievement.</p>

<p>Well we certainly have more 'credit' than we used to. Trouble is there does not seem to be any actual money kicking around to support it.<br/>Sure, pack the country with as many people as you can, get them to buy smartphones they don't need and call it growth.<br/>Yep - its all good.</p>

<p>Only because Debt = Money these days.  Borrowing Power is the new Power.</p>

<p>Indeed</p>

<p>Since the days of King William III, the country's wars against the Louis XIV and his successors, Napoleon, the industrial revolution and wars against Germany were all won with debt.</p>

<p>I think Tommy Atkins might have had something to do with it?</p>

<p>Fair enough, but debt bought his Lee Enfield.</p>

<p>I like that - good reply.<br/>I'll will bank that one for a later date.</p>

<p>Yes, 1700 is when it started, and in fact the National Debt as an annual percentage of GDP has often been much higher than it is now - but the trouble is the actual amount, rather than the annual percentage of GDP, just keeps racking up.</p>

<p>Agree, it needs to come down, but while the pound still has reserve status it is not too much of an issue.</p>

<p>I read the other day that the interest alone on the national debt is 43 billion quid. Yep, the Tories have really got to grips with the economy.</p>

<p>no its because the government have taken the necessary steps to turn things around. there is nothing new about borrowing.</p>

<p>Nothing new about how long you can keep doing it either.  I think 300+ years is pushing your luck.</p>

<p>I can agree with  the thrust of your comments but I hope that Labour will pull the politics back from the City and their mates.</p>

<p>It will not be easy as they have a lot of power and influence but making us all suffer just to keep the few in Bolly cannot be sustained forever.</p>

<p>So speaks the perennial failure desperate for everyone else to bail him out.</p>

<p>It is not going to happen chum.</p>

<p>The Establishment and Labour's tribal voters both need to accept that Labour is no longer a potential party of government and therefore cannot continue to be treated as an opposition worthy of support.</p>

<p>The traditional Labour Party - which was supposed to represent the working people of British - is dead.  It has been taken over by a small cabal of anti-British Communists.</p>

<p>We need a new Opposition.  And the best candidate by far is UKIP.  If The Establishment won't accept that, I hope and pray that Labour's core voters do.</p>

<p>The Labour Party needs to be culled.</p>

<p>Ukip is no candidate,</p>

<p>With a delusional leader that thinks Unresigning was a good idea, Oldham was a stitch up and even thinks people are trying to assassinate him, the only thing Ukip is best candidate for is mass incarceration in the loony bin.</p>

<p>Well you did tell us that there 'might' have been electoral fraud in Oldham.</p>

<p>So, combined with your U turns, you clearly have much in common with Nigel.</p>

<p>He is Nige.</p>

<p>Did you undo his nuts?</p>

<p>No</p>

<p>Perhaps that task fell to your good self ?</p>

<p>No, why do such a thing - the court needs its jester.</p>

<p>'The traditional Labour Party - which was supposed to represent the working people of British'</p>

<p>So, in essence, what you'd prefer is a bit of socialism mixed with a bit of nationalism, I wonder what we'll call it?</p>

<p>I don't believe the 'traditional' Labour Party was like that at all.</p>

<p>And your evidence of this is where exactly?</p>

<p>They're not really communists. They're post-marxist progressives, as are the rest of the political class. Bit different.</p>

<p>Sounds spot on, and explains why we can't tell the difference between the political cults of the "Left" and political cults of the "Right" any longer.</p>

<p>What's the difference, then, between a communist and a "post-marxist progressive". I ask because I have a friend who  supports Corbyn and is one or the other. I find it easier to regard him as a communist and I'm ignorant about the niceities of differentials.</p>

<p>Communism is an economic and historical theory which considers social evolution superstructural to economic development and the ownership and mode of production. Progressivism is a moralist ideology based on the "reform" of the lower orders from above. Post-marxism is a theory developed after the war which applies the Marxist analysis of class struggle to social groups, in which identified "victim" classes are elevated above the identified "hegemonic" class.</p>

<p>Post-marxist progressivism asserts that all social problems are a moral issue of discrimination by hegemonic classes (white, male, straight, cis etc) against victim classes (BME, female, gay, trans etc) and thus the moral leaders of society must reform and diminish the hegemonic classes by force. Perceived wealth, status, safety etc are "privileges" of the hegemonic classes which must be removed.</p>

<p>Marx wouldn't recognise any of this. Hence, post-marxism.</p>

<p>Ian B<br/>Is what you describe as "Post-marxist progressivism the same as Cultural Marxism?</p>

<p>Sort of. PMP incorporates CM as a justifying ideology, but rather than a communist conspiracy, the root cause (in my hypothesis) is the quest for moral authority by Western elites, who grabbed onto CM as a convenient moral system after the collapse of Christianity as the basic moral system.</p>

<p>Progressivism has existed since the Victorian Era. It was particularly acute in the USA. This is the second wave of it. The first was powered by Christian values, this Second wave appeals to post-marxist (or cultural marxist, if you prefer) theory. In both cases it is a kind of "State AS Church" in which moral leadership is the defined role of government.</p>

<p>Thank you Ian</p>

<p>Well, a communist wouldn't be interested in maintaining a capitalist system for one.  Communism is a completely different economic system, where socialism is merely redistribution of a capitalist one.</p>

<p>I'm not sure about his attitude to capitalism but he does sympathise with downtrodden minorities such as the IRA, Islamic extremists and other terrorists, and he hates Americans. Still, he's 90 so not much of a threat.</p>

<p>Yep! Thatcher started it; Blair continued it, and now Cameron can't resist the bribes, the slush funds, the secret payments etc that flow from corrupt arms deals with the Saudis.</p>

<p>As the old saying goes, one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter; these things are never binary though.  Haven't seen any evidence of him hating Americans either (or any news) - what's the reasoning behind that one?</p>

<p>Reasoning? From regular Torygraph readers? Unlikely.</p>

<p>They do have a most binary view of the world.  At least children still have imagination.</p>

<p>What freedom are Hezbollah, an private army funded by Iran to fight in foreign wars, fighting for?</p>

<p>I believe that would be for actions taken by Israel previously.</p>

<p>Hezbollah are fighting Syrian rebels because of the actions of Israel?</p>

<p>Well, if they are fighting Syrian rebels, then they are hardly terrorists, are they...</p>

<p>I was referring to my old friend. He can't stand anything American: films, popular music, etc. He denies that they helped win two world wars. I don't know about the reasoning, if any.</p>

<p>Oh, misinterpretation from myself there then.  I used to abhor Americans, but after visiting multiple times, I love the place.  Well, at least in the democratic coastal regions! ;)</p>

<p>Almost everyone in the country believes in redistribution through taxation too. Its just a question of how much.So Corbyn isn't that radical.</p>

<p>Corbyn isn't radical at all. It's just that after decades of rampant neoliberalism, Torygraph readers can't handle the idea that fairness and equality could be concepts worth discussing.</p>

<p>Do they? I don't think you're right on that one. </p>

<p>Exactly.  Obviously the amount is somewhere in between nothing and everything.  Alas, our politicians appear to have binary views on this, as they seem to on everything else.  Rather than a reasoned and pragmatic discussion, it is driven largely by ideology.</p>

<p>The trouble with the UK is that has always been caught in the middle, somewhere between Europe and the USA; it has no idea what it wants, and so tries to achieve both - an ideal which would necessitate higher taxes than what you'd get in any of the Scandinavian countries (have to pay for all that defence somehow!).</p>

<p>What?!</p>

<p>What?!</p>

<p>I don't know any members of the Labour Party who are Communists..</p>

<p>You haven't looked very hard.</p>

<p>I actually know Labour Party members : ))</p>

<p>Likewise.</p>

<p>It is astonishing how angry people get when the party of the workers starts to return to advocating workers again.</p>

<p>Anybody would either think that they like to be exploited, or are the exploiters...</p>

<p>If Labour are now an "utterly irrelevant Cult", why waste everyone's time writing hysterical nonsense like this. Let the people decide.</p>

<p>You have to have balanced reporting to allow people to decide.</p>

<p>I think we'll be waiting a long time before balance comes to the discussion of Jeremy Corbyn.  One or two Indy and Guardian writers are showing signs, but the masses are still frothing at the mouth.  I hold out no hope for the Telegaf having the ability to offer balanced reporting!</p>

<p>With the liberals, the greens and ukip a distant memory, those who are opposed to yet more austerity will vote labour. Therefore, like it or not Heffer and co, Labour will probably win in 4 years time. </p>

<p>Most people support reducing spending in order to rebalance the economy.</p>

<p>Corbyn cannot win, especially not as he's making himself less and less popular by the day.</p>

<p>And how are you calling UKIP a distant memory? They got millions more votes at the last election, a lot of them former Labour voters.</p>

<p>Ukip have one Tory MP, that's it. Irrelevant.</p>

<p>Ah, the old 'rebalancing the economy' argument.  The thing is though, the rebalancing has referred to the City's dominance and the dearth of manufacturing, not the size of government.  So the point is moot.</p>

<p>UKIP is a distant memory unless the voting system changes to a proportional one.  UKIP's support is too spread out for them to have any chances of winning many seats, and it is unlikely that the average voter will 'waste' their vote on them again.  Under a proportional system, they'd get good support though.</p>

<p>Besides, with the haste they got out of Oldham after defeat, I'd seriously doubt if many give them any thought to becoming elected.</p>

<p>People support reducing spending so that we are not bankrupting the country with unsustainable debt.</p>

<p>Anyone who opposes this is financially irresponsible, and will not be trusted to run the country.</p>

<p>Remember; It's the economy, stupid!</p>

<p>Though I doubt the veracity of the figures, I'll use David in Rome's source just to spite him...the debt is obviously not unsustainable given that the UK has had far higher debt in prior times:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/debt_history" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukpublicspending.co...</a></p>

<p>I definitely oppose the levels of private debt though; that is most definitely fiscally irresponsible.  But it keeps on going up, so it seems we're largely a nation of fiscally ignorant individuals.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, anyone who's ever run a business knows that you can only grow by investment, not by cutting costs.  This is what the sane one's have been saying to Osborne for years.  I must say, he does have a lot of rhetoric about the subject; it's just a great pity he doesn't have the brains to do what he says.</p>

<p>You can make a business more profitable by reducing costs, not by borrowing more than your revenues can service.</p>

<p>If you reduce costs and increase profitability you can then invest to grow, but constantly borrowing to service earlier debt while never turning a profit is a recipe for bankruptcy.</p>

<p>You can make a business more profitable by reducing costs, or a combination of cost cutting and efficiency gains.  However, you cannot grow a business by doing those.  You just end up getting swallowed up by a competitor, or completely outdone.</p>

<p>The interest rates on long term debt are so low that it's neither here nor there as to whether it can be afforded; in the end, either inflation or money printing will make it disappear, as was the case in times gone bye.</p>

<p>A closer look at various countries around the world reveal that a large number never turn a profit, as such.  Very few have a BoP surplus on the Current Account.  Meanwhile, with an independent currency, bankrupty is not a possibility.</p>

<p>Except there has been no austerity, this is just another of the myths that Lefties like to tell.</p>

<p>Public spending has gone up ever since Labour left government, leaving a note saying :<br/><i></i></p>

<p><i>"Dear Chief Secretary</i></p>

<p><i>I'm afraid there is no money<br/>kind regards - and good luck!</i></p>

<p><i>Liam",</i></p>

<p>David in Rome, meet reality....</p>

<p>Perhaps you'd like to check out some facts then...</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34790102" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-p...</a></p>

<p>Ah, the BBC, well that's proved it hasn't it...</p>

<p>Now have a look at the real facts:</p>

<p>2010 £673bn<br/>2015 £748bn<br/>2016 £760bn</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk" rel="nofollow">www.ukpublicspending.co.uk</a></p>

<p>QED.</p>

<p>Actually, it's the IFS and Treasury, where the BBC referenced the figures from (if you had actually bothered to read the article, this would have been evident).</p>

<p>You might want to start using real rather than nominal figures too, like us economists do.</p>

<p>QED :)</p>

<p>Er, those figures are from the Treasury.</p>

<p>All the BBC is doing is selective use of the figures, one REAL number it very definitely omits is debt repayments.</p>

<p>QED :)</p>

<p>Yes, that is the point I made, David.  Do keep up.  Meanwhile, the figures you provided are given by one Christopher Chantrill, whoever he may be?  I'd certainly trust the BBC over an unknown website.</p>

<p>Not quite sure what debt repayments have to do with austerity and budget cuts?  You said "Public spending has gone up ever since Labour left government", and yet the evidence states you are incorrect and that the majority of government spending has taken massive hits.</p>

<p>QED :) :)</p>

<p>Please insert another credit and try again!</p>

<p>Well of course you would prefer the BBC.</p>

<p>As I pointed out they exclude debt repayments in their cleverly constructed propaganda.</p>

<p>The fact is - and I have shown incontrovertible figures to show it, Public expenditure has gone up. Austerity is a myth.</p>

<p>I am nowhere near you on the political spectrum, but you are right about austerity being a myth. Debate is meaningless if you base it on what you want to be true rather than what actually is true.</p>

<p>Thank you, the amount of evidence free opinion in these pages used to amaze me, not now, it unusual to find logical reasoning.</p>

<p>I'll happily argue civilly with anyone if they are able to produced fact based evidence to advance the case of the truth.</p>

<p>So, how do you explain the facts:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34790102" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-p...</a></p>

<p>Austerity is a myth? Perhaps you ought to get out more.</p>

<p>Public expenditure</p>

<p>2010 £673bn<br/>2015 £748bn</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/total_spending_2010UKbn" rel="nofollow">http://www.ukpublicspending.co...</a></p>

<p>Austerity is indeed a myth.</p>

<p>But Osborne said we had to go back to austerity yesterday.</p>

<p>Also, that quote is a long standing joke.  Each government used to leave litle jokes like that to the incoming party.</p>

<p>The Tories decided to spin it and another historical trandition was trashed for a bit of politics to hoodwink the ill informed.</p>

<p>The quote may have been a joke, the joke though was at the expense of the British - because it was true.</p>

<p>Not only was there no money, Labour left the country with the same amount of debt - and more to come through Enron PFI scheme accounting - as if we had fought another world war.</p>

<p>Osborne of course likes to show off his tough chancellor image, the truth remains that there is no austerity, <b>spending continues to go up</b>.</p>

<p>There was never any money in 1997 either.  So what's your point?</p>

<p>The debt was piffling in 1997 and the economy was well able to pay it. PFI schemes were tiny in comparison to 2010 and the trend was down.</p>

<p>It took 18 years to sort out the mess Labour left in the 70s, this mess will take much longer, our children and grandchildren will be paying for Brown's excess for all their lives.</p>

<p>Ah yeah, PFI. New Labour loved PFI; as did Major before them and Cameron after them.</p>

<p>Propaganda.</p>

<p>Major's and Cameron's use of PFI were utterly trivial compared to that we saw under Labour, that not satisfied with doubling the amount of money thrown at the NHS, to no discernible purpose other that create Staffordshire Hospital scandals, saw the NHS laden with huge amounts of debt.</p>

<p>No. And I'm no lover of New Labour. PFI was a monstrous idea, started by the Tories.</p>

<p>Indeed it was a monstrous idea started by the Tories but never used to the extent Brown did.</p>

<p>Piffling?  At 40-45% of GDP?  Well, it's only twice that amount now, so according to your logic it must be twice as piffling!</p>

<p>The economy is well able to pay it now too; that is why there has been no run on the pound, nor a downgrading of the UK's credit rating.</p>

<p>Labour left little mess in the '70's as they left little in 2010.  Both times the economic situation was affected by external situations, not internal one's.  Meanwhile, Brown managed to grow the economy at great guns and keep the deficit constant for over a decade.  What's Osborne down?  Well, he's doubled the debt, and his mythical surplus is just that, a myth.</p>

<p>Funnily enough, it takes investment to grow an economy; this is the fundamental error that the Connies do not understand.  Instead, they're trying to do it via inflating house prices and creating ever more debt, and via unrestricted immigration.  As usual, it will take a Labour government to actually get the country back to normal.</p>

<p><i>"Labour left little mess in the '70's as they left little in 2010."</i></p>

<p>You're no economist, you're just another shallow comic and apologist for the worst and most irresponsible government the country has ever seen.</p>

<p>Brown took the national debt from less than 50% of GDP, followed Tory spending rules through the first parliament which took it down to 40%, then went completely wild, taking it up to 80% a good part as a result of the international banking crisis he helped create having lit the blue touch paper on criminal levels of borrowing.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could tell us what the current national debt is, and how much is spent every year just paying off the interest on that debt, and what that payment is as a percentage of GDP?</p>

<p>Of course the current national debt is larger than when the Tories came to power - all this does is reveal the lie behind your (pl) screaming "austerity".</p>

<p>It will take 2 generations to sort out the criminal mess that Labour left. Perhaps Labour will be electable by then.</p>

<p>By the way, the interest per year on the ND is £43bn. That's 3% of GDP. Osborne is utterly clueless.</p>

<p>Piffle.</p>

<p>Just the act of coming into power took gilt yields down from Greek levels to lower than Germany.</p>

<p>The estimate is a difficult one but it approximates to perhaps £150bn of interest savings pa, just as a result of change of chancellor.</p>

<p>Clearly niblets you are the clueless one.</p>

<p>The UK has never had gilt yields as high as Greek one's.  Again, evidence seems to offend you greatly.</p>

<p>Liar. Just before Brown was ejected UK Gilts were selling at the same level as Greece's.</p>

<p>Lol, you do realise that Greece was still a stable economy at that stage, don't you?</p>

<p>Meanwhile Greek bond yields peaked at over 40% in 2012, when their crisis first hit.  Meanwhile, the UK yield peaked at just under 5.5% over the entire period of 2006 to 2016.<br/></p>

<p>Stable, Greece? For how long? a couple of days? Wow.</p>

<p>So first we've had your crass logical fallacies and now the stable Greek economy.</p>

<p>Osborne has missed every target. The deficit gone by 2015? Hmmm, no, let's make it 2019. Despite all his austerity, things have just got worse. And they've got worse because of his policies, not despite them.</p>

<p>Nonsense. There has been no austerity. If there were there would have been riots in the street - we saw this over the relatively timid amendments made to Student loans.</p>

<p>Rubbish.</p>

<p>There has been no austerity and if there were your pips would certainly be squeaking.</p>

<p>Public Expenditure:<br/>2010 £673bn<br/>2015 £748bn</p>

<p></p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Er no.</p>

<p>So what are the correct figures then?</p>

<p>But in the interests of making you look an even bigger fool than you've already done so for yourself, here are the correct figures:</p>

<p>2009-10: £763.2b<br/>2010-11: £765.4b<br/>2011-12: £751.3b<br/>2012-13: £754.0b<br/>2013-14: £740.4b<br/>2014-15: £742.4b</p>

<p>So, not only are your figures nominal values, but they're also not including everything they need too.</p>

<p>Now, if you compare back to my original rebuttal of your nominal figures, you'll see that spending in all areas apart from Health, Energy, and Aid have increased.  Oh, and of course, the Cabinet Office (those SpAds aren't cheap now!).  That means that here has been significant cuts in every other department.  But hey, you already knew that from the same item, didn't you.</p>

<p>QED :) :) :)</p>

<p>Wow, the drop is about 21bn over 5 years or about an average of <b>4bn per annum</b>, taking into account inflation - something  of a dodgy measure depending on what is in the basket at any one time.</p>

<p>Really this is not a great deal in the scope of things. Of course there has been redistribution between the various departments which means that some departments have suffered more than others but overall the screams of austerity have been greatly exaggerated.</p>

<p>Um, Dave, it's for you to come up with the correct figures, not for me to have to teach you how to do the job you think you're doing.  It's called initiative.  Show some for a change.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Oh dear, you clearly haven't been around here for long have you.</p>

<p>The idea that I might be Farage is the most comical I've read in decades. Ask any of the real kippers what I think about him.</p>

<p>I took you for a Conservative Central Office shill at first; I regret that now.</p>

<p>Thanks, not many admit error on here - to your great credit.</p>

<p>Personally I don't trust any politicians, I don't think they are fundamentally untrustworthy as a breed, it is just that the circumstances force them to follow the old way - the art of the possible, which can mean the reality of the short term quick win.</p>

<p>What really frustrates is <br/>1. the empty headed comments about Politicians in general. It's not a popular viewpoint but most enter the profession for the right reasons and many if not the vast majority will stay true to those reasons and<br/>2. the actually difficulty of the job of government. Too many think there is some kind of magic wand that can be waved, everything will be sorted out and there will be no consequences</p>

<p>Sitting in on debates in Westminster is educational, there may not be many there but there will be a reasonable number, going over the nitty gritty of legislation to try to get it right for the country, they will typically get no thanks for this from the public.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>You would do well to take on board the old but modified statement that sometimes it is better not to post to avoid revealing that one actually is a fool.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Ah, so your first logical fallacy was Reductio ad absurdum, now it's Argumentum ad Populum</p>

<p>You're really not very good at this are you...</p>

<p>But clearly anyone who mistakes ME for Farage is nothing short of a Raving Loony.</p>

<p>Well, my qualifications and experience speak otherwise.  Um, Brown never took debt to 80%.  You may not have noticed, but that giant external even the GFC did that one.  I see you've gone to the 'Dave Cameron School of Propaganda' and graduated with honours though.  </p>

<p>Of course Brown helped cause the GFC.</p>

<p>He stoked up the city, set up the FSA that didn't regulate it and praised it at every opportunity. It generated huge profits for the city on asset growth, so Brown could tax it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile over in the USA they followed the City and finally got rid of the controls that had been put in place at the Great Depression and low and behold the lunatic levels of asset growth accelerated.</p>

<p>Brown didn't cause the GFC on his own, that would be unreasonable but he IS one of the guilty men, possibly No.3 behind Greenspan and Clinton, perhaps no.2.</p>

<p>Yes and then the Labour liars claimed that growth was returning when they had simply left out PFI and the public pension commitments from their retrospective economic assessment.</p>

<p>If you added those two elements back in, the full horror lay before you.</p>

<p>Loathsome people from a loathsome party, now happily for the people of Great Britain, gone for ever.</p>

<p>Well said sir. Indeed loathsome.</p>

<p>What amazes is that the New-Old Labour we have now is even more loathsome, the manifestation of 1980's Student Trot politics.</p>

<p>They are now irrelevant - a footnote in British politics history.</p>

<p>We will not be seeing the Labour party again in power. They are joining the BNP.</p>

<p>I've had a troubled relationship with a retired Labour activist-poster in these pages since the DT Comments/Blogs started up.</p>

<p>I have long teased him with the fact that there will not be another Labour government in his lifetime.</p>

<p>His parting word to me on the 8th May 2015 was "fascist".</p>

<p>I wish however one thing would come out of this, a middle of the road Social Democrat party able to provide effective opposition to the Tories, our democracy is unhealthily unbalanced at the moment.</p>

<p>Yes I agree. And I do think that such an opposition will develop with time. The best Conservative governments become stale and arrogant and need opposition.</p>

<p>I don't respond to the chap who childishly goads me simply because he has had complaints over his stalking habits.</p>

<p>Such fantasist behaviour goes with the territory and one cannot avoid it,  but it should not, in my view be encouraged.</p>

<p>Some of this type regularly  end up in court these days.</p>

<p>Au contraire, the UK economy in 1997 was in good shape and Labour took advantage of it before ruining it.</p>

<p>The UK economy was good in 2007 too, before external events too over.</p>

<p>Rot.</p>

<p>The borrowing trend was up and the "external events" were in many ways caused by Brown and his mate Greenspan - with some help from Bill Clinton who had insisted financial institutions in the US provide mortgages for all, irrespective of ability to pay.</p>

<p>And yet the economy was growing nicely and the deficit pretty much constant.  The facts disagree with you, once again.</p>

<p>What are you talking about.</p>

<p>The trend in growth was in many ways financed by the huge increase in immigration and the increase in public debt - in real terms - was huge.</p>

<p>Two things we can be sure about with Labour "Economists" like Balls:<br/>1. Dishonesty and spin<br/>2. Irrelevance</p>

<p>You lot lost, the Labour government of 1997-2010 has been thoroughly and correctly recognised as the most profligate in history. That reputation will never be lived down.</p>

<p>Can you imagine the mess if the Tories had been in when the Crash hit in 2008? I'm no fan of New Labour, but under the Tories we'd have had even more financial deregulation and it would have been catastrophic.</p>

<p>It's an interesting opinion but it is just that - opinion.</p>

<p>Simply by looking at the Tory love of deregulation, it's an easy conclusion to arrive at.</p>

<p>No, just opinion. I consider it extremely unlikely, the Tories would never have inflated the economy the way Brown did.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Well yes, your opinion is indeed coherently crazy.</p>

<p>Not even the worst of Labour activists argue that the economy was doing nicely under Labour.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Only in your crazed imagination.</p>

<p>"The trend in growth was in many ways financed by the huge increase in <br/>immigration and the increase in public debt - in real terms - was huge."</p>

<p>Exactly the same situation that Osborne is encouraging.  But without the investment to support future growth.</p>

<p>Not sure why you're associating me with Labour; never voted for them.  I'm a centrist.  Just another one of your grand assertions without a fact to stand on.</p>

<p>No Mr.B</p>

<p>you're clearly another apologist for the Brown-Balls disaster.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>No, of course not dear.</p>

<p>Labour inherited a deficit of 3.9% in 1997.</p>

<p>The economy was in good shape and growing: Labour admitted it.</p>

<p>That was tiny new_number and I think you know it.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>I doubt many people would know what a billion pounds looked like.</p>

<p>The irony is that when Brown took over discussion and budgets were in the millions. The vocabulary changes to billions while he was crucifying the country with his end to "Boom and Bust".<br/>.</p>

<p>Mind you, it amuses me that there is anyone arguing that Brown and Labour in the naughties was anything but a disaster for the country ...like the echo in an empty barrel.</p>

<p>Well, it takes up a fair few pallets, I can tell you that much, so it's pretty hard to miss.  You might not know exactly how much it was, but you'd be able to hazard a reasonable guess.  That's what comes from actually handling money.</p>

<p>Um, you do realise that it's been 18 years since Brown took over, don't you?  Have you looked at the levels of inflation in that time?  See, this is why us economists use real figures, rather than nominal one's.  It's how you get the truth.</p>

<p>No, you just twist the truth.</p>

<p>I almost feel sorry for you MrB, you will no doubt be spluttering about how good Labour was as they cart you off in a straightjacket, normal people looking on in mild amusement.</p>

<p>Well, as I say, I'm more than happy enough to meet up to verify these things.  But like Shakey, blackjoke, and many others, none of you have the cojones to step up to the plate or wager on it; you are just faceless internet trolls, with no evidence, just blinkered, ideological rhetoric, based on a binary view of the world.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, I can't hear the little white wagon coming.  Sounds like another one of your assertions with no factual basis.</p>

<p>QED :)</p>

<p>Ironic that you accuse others of being "faceless internet trolls" with that Moniker.</p>

<p>I at least have a first name on display and without too much effort could be identified.</p>

<p>QED :)</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>I like your wit Mr.B, it's good.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate though that it is not matched with good sense.</p>

<p>Keep posting though, it is always interesting to have someone proclaim how good we had it under Brown, it helps remind people that a) it wasn't, b) putrefying Labour fruitcakes remain ready to ruin the country again.<br/>.</p>

<p>Oh, and I would no more wish to argue with you about how brilliant Labour was than go down to the local asylum for a discussion on Nuclear Physics - though I would likely get more sense from them than from you.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>I wonder if your qualifications are as worthy/hypocritical as <br/>a) your rubbishing of other posters because they are anonymous<br/>b) your support of Brown.</p>

<p>Of course sorting out the mess left by Labour, and the appalling Enron economics of wild PFI deals saddling the NHS and other government departments will take generations.</p>

<p>That you think I am already in the asylum when you proclaim how brilliant Brown was is proof enough of your own difficulty with reality.</p>

<p>Well, they get me an income in the top 5% of UK earners and allow me to hobknob with an array of other top earners, so they must have some worth.  We can compare tax returns too, if you'd like?</p>

<p>First time I've heard PFI related to energy trading - quite how do you get that relationship to work?</p>

<p>I think you're in an asylum because you're incoherent, ideologically blinkered, and do not have the means to meet up.  You're not smart enough to be a criminal given your binary view of the world, so an asylum makes sense.</p>

<p>Look if I want to argue with imbeciles, there are plenty of kippers around.</p>

<p>The last thing I need is another Labour delusional arguing that Brown was good.</p>

<p>Its certainly a possibility.</p>

<p>This could have been avoided had the right mot moved more to the right and pumped all of our wealth to the already rich.</p>

<p>They will reap what they sowed.</p>

<p>They probably thought they had all the right people bought and in the bag.</p>

<p>I wonder if they have a chillout room for the post rant calmdown.</p>

<p>It has a lot of rubber in it, I hear...</p>

<p>In brief, Mr. Heffer says that Labour is now an "utterly irrelevant cult" run by malevolent nutters "under the heel of pressure groups whose views are extreme, [and] unrepresentative." I think he is only half right.</p>

<p>The problem nowadays is that the political class still imagines that people see their political views in terms of Party, with loyalty to a Party fundamentally based on the old divides between rich and poor, upper class and lower class, city and county. They have failed to understand that the introduction of the identity group power structure has swept that concept into the dustbin of history. People support the goals of their identity group leadership now, not any particular political party.</p>

<p>This is the explanation for the rise of Corbyn, and why Mr. Heffer is only half right. Corbyn is, to some degree, under the heel of extreme pressure groups, but those groups are very representative of the populace as a whole, not unrepresentative.</p>

<p>Half the population of Britain is female. Only a small minority do not see themselves as feminists, while the majority look to female identity group leadership as their real political representatives, not political parties. A significant portion of the population is made up of racial minorities, and similarly this population looks to their various identity group (pressure group) leadership for their political line. Homosexuals? Environmentalists? I could go on, but I think my point is clear.</p>

<p>And Corbyn is the representative of all these groups in Parliament. Without him, they are divided, with him they are united. He may indeed be subject to 'pressure' from these groups, but he knows he can suppress and weaken any irksome identity group leader by a simple direct appeal to that leader's constituency.</p>

<p>Thus, while Labour under Corbyn and his cronies is indeed malevolent and cultish, so is a large and growing proportion of the population. That is the true problem the political class must grapple with. They have spent fifty years creating this monster, but refuse to see that it is now alive.</p>

<p>I disagree with your views on a cult having risen, but the rest is a good analysis.</p>

<p>"Most newspapers would rather report, for the enlightenment of their readers, a church jumble sale than devote precious news pages to the antics of this utterly irrelevant cult"</p>

<p>Apparently, except for Simon Heffer in the Telegraph.</p>

<p>"Even if it now has 370,000 members – half of whom appear to be malignant, Britain-hating Trotskyists"<br/>Is this accurate?</p>

<p>"......that still means that 64,630,000 or so people frankly couldn’t give a stuff."<br/>Really - your including non-voting people under eighteen - including new born babies?<br/>What kind of trite reporting is this. I would suggest opinionated piffle!!</p>

<p>the general thrust of the article is correct. that the labour party is no longer a serious party of opposition. corbyn is making it virtually unelectable. what a brilliant way to run a political party!</p>
