<p>If you wanted to discredit not just the Labour Party but the entire Westminster circus, then you could not have hired a better man than Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

<p>We now have proof positive, that politicians will do and say anything to put their own interests and ideology ahead of the needs and wishes of those who elect them.</p>

<p>Goodness. What a bitter old sod this McTernan guy is. I've never heard or know him  thank God, because he would drain your very soul with his negativity. What a sad angry man he sounds.  </p>

<p>The real story is not that Labour retained the seat but about who came <br/>in 2nd place. UKIP, got more votes in this by election than the <br/>Conservatives,LibDems,Greens,Monster Raving Looney Party and 'others' put <br/>together.</p>

<p>I'll have  "Always look on the bright side of life"  running through my head all day now !  <br/>Thanks for the laugh though</p>

<p>It is this kind of cruel and bullying and dehumanising language that discredits you.</p>

<p>It exposes vulnerable people to savage physical attack by bigots.  It is hate language if ever there was such.</p>

<p>"Corbyn is not just the emblem of white working class voters' alienation from Labour. He is the creator of new grievances"</p>

<p>Gobbledygook,<br/> Blairs no 1 man knows  until  Murdoch endorses Corbyn in the SUN gutter press he is doomed</p>

<p>Great article. Thanks. Mainstream media is looking more ridiculous and rabidly disorientated every day. Keep on discrediting yourselves and believing that you are forming public consciousness. Those days are fast fading, thank God.<br/>Also, please use McTernan all you can. He's perfect. I've met the creep. He will not engage with a single though that contradicts his witless Red Tory mission (as we all understand, now that we've seen the Blair years and how this kind of malign deception works)  . This article, in truth, is utter rubbish from a man with no brain of his own at all.</p>

<p>Clearly there are only  6,000 people who voted for UKIP  in Oldham who still retain their sanity.</p>

<p>I expected UKIP to do better in the Oldham election considering how the <br/>EU backed  the bailout of the Greek banks, the Paris  bombing atrocities with the expected backlash of Islamophobia and   the unfolding immigrant crises three great issues for Farage's  one trick pony.<br/>The people of Oldham surprised the pundits, Corbyn's first test as leader <br/>came as a shock to all that had predicted a UKIP win or a massive reduction in Labours share of the vote;</p>

<p> Corbyn had a huge majority in the Labour leadership election, tens of <br/>thousands of people came in from the cold and gave him their vote.<br/>Corbyn was/is seen by many in the UK as a principled honest left wing <br/>politician., so his opponents have taken it upon themselves to destroy <br/>this perception.<br/>Day after day we are presented with accusations ; " On terrorism. On nuclear weapons. On Remembrance Sunday. On the Royal Family and the national anthem. On all these issues Corbyn has created new doubts – often, indeed, certainties – among core Labour voters."</p>

<p>With the help of pro Iraq war cronies of Blair  "the Tories have started punching the message home in their language – Corbyn is a threat to British security.'</p>

<p>The question remains taboo how Blair much and the writer of this vitriolic piece are responsible for the middle east mess.</p>

<p>All attacks are designed to destroy his image, to make him unpalatable for the moderate middle,<br/>Corbyn is positioned as a hard left politician his policies unpalatable for the electorate 'moderate' middle<br/>Undoing  privatisation is seen as a  Corbyn 'hard left' policy has  support <br/>from the majority of people polled on the question.<br/>Many voters are appalled with the consequences of privatisation of water, energy and rail, services have not improved and prices have soared, many of the services now owned by foreign investors.</p>

<p>Its not clear-cut what exactly the centre ground is, with sound bites <br/>and clever marketing,  Blair and now Cameron/Osborne claim  to occupy <br/>the centre ground in British politics.<br/>Many people don't bother to vote because the first past the post electoral <br/>system is not a reliable representation of cast votes , the last election gave UKIP 1 seat and the SNP 50, that while more people voted forUKIP in the G.E.<br/>What about the 1 third of the electorate that don't bother</p>

<p>Then along came Oldham and all the smears against Corbyn didn't have the <br/>desired effect, a landslide for Labour, yes Corbyn proved that he was <br/>not as toxic as the right=wing press had predicted.<br/>All the smears against Corbyn are working in his favour, people sense that he is being, to put it mildly, unfairly treated. He is now the underdog, people feel <br/>sympathy for underdogs and will lend their ear to what he has to say.</p>

<p>"A Tory government that just squeezed in at the last election"??? What are you on about, the Conservatives had a landslide. Are you on a different planet?</p>

<p>Over 70% of the overall vote is still not good enough for the Telgraph.</p>

<p>This constant, relentless onslaught of  Corbyn increases the perception that this publication is jaundiced and un-reliable and not to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>Give it a rest, before you loose all credibility with your 'Daily Mail' journalism and constant sniping.</p>

<p>"In the end, turnout on Thursday was a respectable 40.26%, with 7,115 of the 27,791 ballots cast via postal votes. Ukip has made much noise over allegedly “bent” votes. <b>But the truth is that even without any postal ballots McMahon would still have had a clear lead over his Ukip rival, businessman John Bickley, who polled just 6,487 votes</b>".</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/04/shock-all-round-as-labour-strolls-to-oldham-byelection-victory" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/pol...</a></p>

<p>It occured to me that the reason so many righties are against postal votes is that it allows working people, who would not normally have the time and energy to vote, to have their say.</p>

<p>The righties want elections to be dominated by the grey vote. Pensioners.  The Tories natural constituency (which is odd considering how vulnerable they are and righties hate vulnerable people).</p>

<p>I think you'll find that most working people are 'righties'.</p>

<p>To quote Tom Mendelsohn IBT: The best take is that of Tony Blair-era adviser John McTernan, whose enviable track-record of losing elections around the world makes him perfect for a bitter column in the Telegraph. Up is down in McTernan's world, where he claims the result – which, you'll recall, is by all statistical accounts a big red rip curl in the face of the boo-boys – is both somehow a vindication of Blair and the bare minimum Corbyn should have managed. Frankly, if the unprecedented increase in vote share ends up as a Corbyn bare minimum, we'll end up with that socialist utopia in no time.'</p>

<p>Quite.</p>

<p>More drivel from Labour's joke strategist in Scotland. McTernan is reduced to frothing on the Telegraph. It would be funny if it wasn't so pathetic.</p>

<p>Victory for comrade Corybn. Keep up the momentum!</p>

<p>Victory for Comrade Cameron who has managed to sell our power generation to the communists.</p>

<p>Victory for the comrades in the Tory party and their 'close friends' who have taken jobs from bourgeois British workers and given them to the brave heroes of the People's Republic of China.</p>

<p>What did he win exactly?</p>

<p>"Winning the Oldham by- election isn't a triumph for Jeremy Corbyn"  ? <br/>I might try that on my kids when there's no presents to unwrap. <br/>"December 25th isn't Christmas Day"  I'll declare <br/>Think I'll get away with it  ?</p>

<p>That's funny because yesterday you were predicting carnage for Labour in Oldham.</p>

<p>Yet they increased their vote share by 7%</p>

<p>Why would anyone listen to you?</p>

<p>lets have a look at the postal vote shall we?</p>

<p>paragon of virtue or stinking of corruption and tampering just like tower hamlets?</p>

<p>care to hazard a guess?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>The predictions probably put some resolve into the party of spite and envy, and the spite came to the fore.</p>

<p>This election result [despite possible dodgy postal voting which favours labour ] was surprisingly good for Labour considering their dreadful leader and horrendous  splits . Of course being a by election, it means voters who deserted  Labour previously [ e.g. because of fear of SNP holding the balance pf power ] found it safe to return to the fold .</p>

<p>Also it is arguable that Osborne's about turn on austerity and tax credits [ brought about by the Lords Defeat ] have undermined the Conservatives credibility. At the  last election  they told us we have to" finish the job"  with more austerity and "fix the roof" etc with tough action .   A few months later and apparently everything is rosy - money has been found all over the place for this or that pressure group  and apparently  we don't need to cut Tax credits after all.[ It may be thats cuts are conituing but it certainly doesnt look like that  - more like U turn - some might say the previous message smacked of lying ]. Surley the Tories trump card was that the tell it like it is and that they  have a record for fiscal rectitude ? That narrative  was totally  undermined by the  apparently   lax budget and the apparent  U turn on "cuts" . Then of course there's the bombing of Syria debate - which i guess didn't play well with many muslim voters  who are mostly Labour . [ A surprising  25% of whom it is alleged sympathise with ISIS]. It is notable in this context  that  even Benn's  rousing speech  in favour of airstrikes  referred to  attacking or degrading "terrorsts" and Daesh  - not ISIL - and it conveniently glossed over   their  links  to Islam and a caliphate  [I  wonder why ?]</p>

<p>It is also entirely possible that Labour's far left activists  might not have voted in previous election believing  a vote for Labour to be a vote for the the Tories lite but  are now inclined  to turn out and actually vote  for the more radical Corbyn .{..the jurys out on that one though ] .</p>

<p>Cameron's on off views on the EU / renegotiation  and his and his Chancellors  weakness over the need for austerity - which suddenly  came into view  after  having being  embarrassingly beaten in the Lords obviously hasn't helped -  they looked impotent .Thier  subsequent inaction    about  Lords reform  and then appearing to capitulate   and  abandon the tax credit cuts altogether   added insult to injury. This response  doest t make the Conservatives  look that strong or trustworthy  either - in fact it has totally undermined the carefully crafted narrative about austerity and savings  etc. The N Powerhouse doesn't seem to be cutting it with Labour's base either , which of course includes those with more financial concerns i.e. those  on benefits, getting tax credits , muslims and government  employed workers .[ All i reckon well represented  in Oldham ]. UKIP, despite increasing its share of the vote doesn't look to have done that well either although they remain a potential  threat to both Tory and Labour .</p>

<p>Corbyn may yet turn out to be a much bigger threat than the complacent Tories realise .</p>

<p>Oh what utter bull. Labour got the Islamists vote and that was all that happened here ...</p>

<p>So... do Labour just "get the Islamists (sic) vote" every time they win an election?</p>

<p>Where there are lots of them, of course - as any party run by overt terrorist sympathisers would do. What is extraordinary is how little fuss there is in the country over one of its leading parties being taken over by the far Left. Were it the far Right, all hell would break loose.</p>

<p>Reductio ad absurdum.</p>

<p>You could always try answering the question, mate!</p>

<p>I am sorry you did not understand ...</p>

<p>Labour will always win constituencies with large number of sub-continent immigrants. They know which side their bread is buttered, and it is buttered by the Welfare Party.</p>

<p>Perhaps opposing the bombing of their co-religionists helps?</p>

<p>Except that non-EU immigrants voting for the welfare party long precedes even Blair's assault on Iraq.</p>

<p>Rightwingers want to destroy anything that is not them.  They then complain about loony terrorists that want the same.</p>

<p>Really? Let me explain how it really is. Right wingers merely think Lefties to be deluded (with good reason). Lefties think us evil. It's a difference of approach, shall we say.</p>

<p>Some truly desperate flailing from Jolly John McTernan. You can almost smell the bitterness oozing out of him.</p>

<p>hopefully this victory for corbyn will put the release of chilcot nearer</p>

<p>"Mikegogan" below - presumably not a Corbyn or Labour supporter says it well:</p>

<p>"There's a dangerous pattern emerging here:  Corbyn elected leader by 60% of party members, Labour candidate elected by 60% of voters in by-election....."</p>

<p>Actually Labour were elected in Oldham by 62.1% of the voters, so it's - from his point of view - and that of the Conservatives, UKIP supporters and Blairites, far more "dangerous" than he thinks.</p>

<p>Let's have the truth - which is that not only did Jeremy Corbyn prove last night his electability, he proved that if that result were repeated even somewhat across the country, bearing in mind the Conservative vote got slashed in less than half from 19% in May to now a paltry 9.3%</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oldham_West_and_Royton_%28UK_Parliament_constituency%29#Elections_in_the_2010s" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p>

<p>    if a General Election were even held now, let alone 2020, Mr Corbyn would be romping home to one of the biggest landslide victories in British electoral history.</p>

<p>But let's not get carried away, and we'll say at minimum, on this showing, there is not going to be another Conservative government next time round, but almost certainly a majority Labour one.</p>

<p>But don't anyone think as a Jeremy Corbyn supporter I am gloating about this, because like Mr Corbyn himself, my concern is not about the petty rivalries of party politics - which I personally think should be abolished, with a parliament instead of independents, all standing on their own merits as human beings, and all having a "free vote" with their conscience on every single issue - but about what is good for this country, and all of its people.</p>

<p>I support Jeremy Corbyn, because he is I sincerely believe going to do his best to take care of everyone - not just "them" or "us", depending which party just won and which lost.</p>

<p>The rich and undeservedly privileged are terrified of Mr Corbyn, because they think he is going to abolish all their wealth and privileges.</p>

<p>Really he's not, he is only going to take from the rich and give to the poor what they can well afford.</p>

<p>And he will also see to it given enough time that we have a meritocracy, not a plutocracy, so that the best people for the jobs will get them, so that we will have competent people in public life, who will not thus make of our nation an unjust miserable place, in which millions are oppressed by the rule of the unduly greedy and the incompetent.</p>

<p>Nobody has anything to fear from Mr Corbyn becoming leader of our nation, all he will ask people to do, is what they are capable of, and all he will ask them to give up is what they can well afford to give up.</p>

<p>e.g. if a billionaire is currently worth £4 billion, if he has to give up £1 billion of that to for example properly fund the NHS or build more schools and hospitals, will he not manage with just £3 billion left?</p>

<p>For it may well be only that relatively modest kind of level of redistribution of wealth that is required to properly fund our public services, and restore home grown industries, and thus also put back to work the so called "benefit scroungers" whom in reality Mrs Thatcher created by destroying British industry and energy self-sufficiency out of her paranoid fear and hate of the unions.</p>

<p>Which unions incidentally, Mr Corbyn has already shown he is willing to defy and oppose when they are wrong - e.g. he still insists on scrapping Trident (a weapons system that according to ex-Conservative Minister Michael Portillo, we do not actually have an independent nuclear button on anyway) despite the unions complaining about the lost jobs (which Mr Corbyn rightly and justly said would be replaced by civil engineering and manufacturing jobs).</p>

<p>Let's stop all this petty party political rivalry, and have a society in which everybody's concerns and needs are taken into account - and yes, that includes UKIP voters, who should have their concerns addressed.</p>

<p>But I would suggest to them they should be addressed in different ways than the mostly implausible policy of "sending them all home"  - for example, yes, mass immigration is causing a jobs and housing shortage and an overburdening of our public services and the NHS.</p>

<p>But the answer to that is more affordable social or private housing, more funds for the public services and NHS, and more jobs for the British people, which by his pledge to both better fund public services and restore British home grown private industry, Mr Corbyn will create.</p>

<p>And as to people feeling threatened by either terrorism or in reality more realistically throughout the UK, local crime and fears of violence against them, Mr Corbyn has of course pledged to increase police numbers and especially community police.</p>

<p>Please, it's time to stop arguing over party politics or personality politics, and just focus on what's good for the country and all of its people - parties and politicians working together for what's right, instead of party political points scoring and fighting for "top jobs" and personal kudos - that is the mature politics Mr Corbyn is promoting, without which we cannot have a mature, secure, just and truly civilised and happy society.</p>

<p>Yes, let's cut immigration, but we can achieve that by exit of the EU, and also making immigrant countries of origin better places, so they don't want to come here in the first place.</p>

<p>And as a  believer in democracy, I'm sure Mr Corbyn will be the first to give the people a chance to vote on EU exit, even though as with the Syria vote, he may not be personally in favour of it - as though I am a Jeremy Corbyn supporter, that doesn't mean I think he is right about everything, just as none of our individual leaders or politicians are.</p>

<p>And as to this personal attack here on him, that unlike Mr McMahon, he's not "one of the people", "one of the masses", that is true, he certainly is not, and neither should our leaders be - they should have a greater dedication to public duty, and preferably a far higher and superior morality than the rest of us have got.</p>

<p>Or why else should they be fit to lead the rest of us?</p>

<p>It does not matter if our leaders are intellectuals or even born rich, as long as they do what is best for the people - that is the only qualification they need - the wisdom to choose rightly what is in the best interests of the people, and the genuine concern for what the people want and need that motivates them to give that dedication to serve the people truly, and give the people all that they need, and all that is good for them that they want.</p>

<p>We need a leader who cares about everybody, who wants everybody to achieve their full potential, regardless of their current failure or the unfortunate circumstances of their birth - and the only leader of that variety I see before me currently, in the various parties, is Mr Corbyn, and that is why he will continue to have my enthusiastic support.</p>

<p>Lots to support there.</p>

<p>I never understand why people vote to make their lives worse.  Oh, wait, relentless propaganda.</p>

<p>It is a shame that Orwell was not around to see his predictions come to life in Airstrip One.</p>

<p>I am amazed that 'Progress' allowed this article to be included on their website. But thank you mytacount for a very sensible, fair &amp; detailed comment. I too support Jeremy Corbyn as the only MP who can see beyond his own personal career.</p>

<p>He's a freaking lunatic FFS.</p>

<p>No one has anything to fear about Corbyn ? Well I just hope we are never attacked since he cant think of ANY circumstances in which the nuclear  deterrent   or indeed   military force would be used . The man is a lightweight on pretty much everything  from  the administration/leadership  of his own party  , to economics and national  security . He is therefore   a very  real threat to our prosperity and security . He may well appeal to Labours activists and client groups [and the stop the war campaign]  but that doesn't mean he is a safe bet. Communists vehemently  claimed to care  about the people  [ i.e. everybody who want to reach their full potential in your terms  ] but the result has been  disaster  wherever its been tried  - if "caring" were the only criterion Labour would win every election . Unsurprisingly  they don't .</p>

<p>The Tories have systematically run down our military, intellegence and border defences.  In addition, the Police are sounderfunded that even the PM complains about cuts.</p>

<p>Hope we are never attacked.</p>

<p>If we're attacked in a circumstance where our leader would be forced to push the nuclear button, then we're dead already - the whole point about the nuclear button is that can ONLY be pushed in retaliation.</p>

<p>We are MORE likely to be attacked [ and probably  dead as you put it ] by a  hostile nuclear power if our leader says he wont use it "in any circumstances ".  Obviously such a position is absurd [ if it is to be believed ]  since it  would undermine the very  deterrence of our nuclear weapons are intended to have and this the main  the reason for having them. The whole point of strategic deterrence  is that our enemies would know even if they attacked first they'd be dead too since our subs would still be able to respond .</p>

<p>I do wish people would stop this talk of being attacked by some country with a nuclear force. IF it ever happened we would all be dead. This is a point which Corbyn understands but you &amp; too many others do not seem to understand. A nuclear weapon is THE WMD.</p>

<p>What rubbish. We'd be less likely to be attacked by a nuclear power if they know retaliation is certain from UK  subs . Thats  the whole point of a deterrent - to deter  . It doesn't deter if you say you won't use it in any circumstances .</p>

<p>So, basically, you're in favour of democracy,  provided everyone goes along with what you want?  Seems legit.<br/>You can yearn to be led if you wish, some of us really don't want the politicians running every facet of our lives, and giving us a weekly allowance as pocket money, because they know best.</p>

<p>The best part about the result is corbynites think they have a winner, i will be happy if he stays leader until 2020.</p>

<p>Just watch the Tory clown car falling apart.  The next few years will be hilarious.  It will be facinating to see how the Press avoid reporting their collapse.</p>

<p>I am not sure what will be funniest; the Tory chaos when the EU referendum comes, the consequences of a poor people smiting, a scandal that wrecks the party or a photo of porcine fun.</p>

<p>we need a dynamic 70 year old dinosaur to turn the country round</p>

<p>Corbyn has yet to produce a policy on anything that isnt doing nothing but talk.</p>

<p>so you saying he has cameron policies??<br/>A PM Who wasn't bombing other countries would be a good start!!</p>

<p>Exactly.  A PM that is calling on a Ghost Army to support his military campagain.</p>

<p>We were already bombing Iraq, you know, Iraq the country that Labour invaded.</p>

<p>New Labour.  <br/>Labour didn't exist then.</p>

<p>Yes it did, this re writing of history is either childish or sinister, it was the Labour party.</p>

<p>Corbyn is not the Labour that started Iraq!</p>

<p>Oh I thought he had been Labour for 32 years, did he start a new party?</p>

<p>you know full well he was against the iraq war and has been proved right time n time again cameron flawed decisions are legend!</p>

<p>They hate that when they use the 'Iraq Card'.</p>

<p>Corbyn is against everything, everything Tory and everything Labour, he stands for absolutely nothing.  he even wanted to make China getting involved a conditon in Syria.  China, the country who he says we shouldnt deal with at all.</p>

<p>The Tories sold our power to China and are quite happy to send our jobs to China.</p>

<p>So  your point is?</p>

<p>Jobs have been going to china for 50 years.  If you object to it and Chinas human rights why insist they should be involved in Syria.</p>

<p>Corbyn would be another  Chamberlain we know that worked.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>The relief from the Labour supporters posting on here is almost palpable. The sane voters are also very pleased.</p>

<p>We never belived the Press as the righties did.  They are getting a lesson in how reality does not map to propaganda.</p>

<p>So we are all agreed, Farage is a liability and UKIP need a new leader.<br/>But where could we find a replacement?</p>

<p>The choice for UKIP leader is either someone who will continue to tell unpalatable truths about the EU and immigration, and have their reputation trashed by the establishment and mainstream media (who stand to benefit from the status quo), or someone more "acceptable" to the establishment who will end up being indistinguishable from the Liberal, Labour and Conservative androids who got us into this mess in the first place.</p>

<p>Given the choice, I'll be sticking with Farage - he has almost single-handedly led the party from being non-existent just over 20 years ago to winning the EU elections and gaining nearly 4 million votes at the general election - despite an unprecedented and coordinated smear campaign against him and his party.</p>

<p>Oldham was a setback, but Farage, and UKIP, are by no means finished.</p>

<p>Or indeed started</p>

<p>I suspect the reason Labour won in Oldham is to some extent due to the fact that there exists large communities of Asian heritage and given UKIP's unyielding stance on immigration, the voters there were hardly going to give Farage the nod. To use the overworked idiom, Turkeys don't vote for Christmas.</p>

<p>The Tories won because of the votes of the rich, Boomers, pensioners and the comfy middle classes in marginals.</p>

<p>It becomes clear they do not care about the majority of people in  the UK.  The 'asians' are just one group that they want to smite.</p>

<p>What by-election produced the Tories victory you are referring to exactly ?</p>

<p>You'd think if he was such a liability you would want us to keep him. But no, he's obviously still a worry for you.</p>

<p>No. I couldn't care really. Its just a bit of fun. Lets be honest, UKIP will never win anything important. We are talking about people who think that the moon landing and 9/11 were faked but Stargate is a documentary. Farage is an irritating whiny git but so what?</p>

<p>i don't believe those things more likely a lefty student has those ideas.</p>

<p>Lefty students do not trash resturants because they can pay for the repair bills.  Nor do they think that pigs are part of a drinking game.</p>

<p>What's a lefty nowadays?</p>

<p>Well same as always you have the  traditional labour supporters like my in laws and then the  left who will use intimidation  like  those who are threatening those who voted for action in  Syria.</p>

<p>It sounds UKIP's negative anti-Corbyn campaign was a big mistake by them and Farage must accept responsibility for that. He needs to step down as UKIP leader now and concentrate fully on lending his voice and considerable understanding of the EU to supporting the 'Leave' campaign.</p>

<p>You could well be right..<br/>Farage is disappointed that he didn't find an ally in corbyn.. he probably did have but unable to get Corbyn to commit had a bit of a sulk!!</p>

<p>Farage out, Icke for Leader.</p>

<p>The reality of Jeremy Corbyn's "kinder, gentler politics"...</p>

<p>Passing Wind having a little joke, how we all laughed.</p>

<p>Very good boris. :)</p>

<p>As long as you stay upwind of him you should be ok. :-)</p>

<p>Very true</p>

<p>Don't you spell Daisy without an 'e'</p>

<p>Survey from Oldham says that Farage was major reason people did not vote UKIP. Time for him to go.</p>

<p>Whatever, it's only a by election.</p>

<p>Aww, you're the gift that just keeps giving, aren't you!</p>

<p>Any chance that, if Ukip had done any better, you wouldn't be on here crowing over the fall of Corbyn and the inexorable rise of St Nige?</p>

<p>zzzzz again.</p>

<p>"When I have no answer I pretend to be asleep." Thanks for the insight into what makes you such a redoubtable commenter bfp, I can tell I'm learning from a master...</p>

<p>.... fill in the dots. It rhymes with cater in your case.</p>

<p>Alligator?</p>

<p>Potato?</p>

<p>You want mater? I can understand why you might.</p>

<p>Naff orff. You aren't clever enough to play with the adults.</p>

<p>I'm very happy to admit that I'm not on your intellectual level.</p>

<p>You should be admitted - being such a basket case.</p>

<p>And the hits just keep on coming...</p>

<p>Do be quiet or there's no more sweeties for you before bedtime.</p>

<p>You're offering sweeties to someone you don't know but think is a child? That's not creepy at all.</p>

<p>Seeing as you feel the need to have the last word - here it is - "Zyxt"<br/>Bye bye.</p>

<p>'<b>Zyxt</b> (<i>obsolete, Kentish</i>)'</p>

<p>Just a couple of letters away from being the perfect description of you - very well chosen!</p>

<p>God, you're worse than those pesky summer midges. Go away.</p>

<p>Saying 'Bye bye' then coming back for yet another attempt is a bit weak, old chap. I thought, as a self-acknowledged master of the form, you may have realised that.</p>

<p>Never mind, let me show you how it's done:</p>

<p>As much as I've enjoyed your almost-Wildean level of badinage, I think the time has come for us to part, but feel free to respond with another 'last word' if you like. I imagine having the last word is very important to you - it tends to be for the desperate and pathetic.</p>

<p>Where's that fly swatter gone......<br/>.....over to you.....</p>

<p>Breaking news on the Beeb. Farage has resigned.</p>

<p>Panic over. He has refused to accept it.</p>

<p>This is such good news. There was a bit of a worry that Labour might dump Corbyn and become relevant to politics again.</p>

<p>Hmph. Considering the number of hysterical or vindictive blog posts from "the press" about how much they hate Corbyn, everything - including his clothing! I'd say he's more relevant than ever.</p>

<p>Love the Hmph bit.</p>

<p>I thought it merited a hmph or a pfft.</p>

<p>Corbyn will never command majority support in the UK but it looks as though his leadership of Labour is unshakeable short of a General Election defeat.</p>

<p>The country's getting an object lesson in quite how left wing the Labour rank and file actually is; they love Corbyn and they don't necessarily view his 'gaffes' as gaffes. There is no way back for the moderates this side of 2020, and possibly not the other side either.</p>

<p>Mr Cameron is doing to hand Labour a gift of having new candidate selections for the reduced number of constituencies.</p>

<p>What 'gaffs' would they be then? </p>

<p>Too many to list, but failing to give a ringing endorsement of using deadly force against fanatics attempting mass casualty attacks for a start. Even George Galloway thought he was wrong on that one.</p>

<p>The police said they don't have a 'shoot to kill' policy so it wasn't a gaff at all; posting, "too many to list" isn't an answer old chap.</p>

<p>How are things in your cynical world and would you like to explain  why the left are bad and the moderates are good and the differences between them?</p>

<p>I didn't actually make a value judgement of good or bad in my post - that's just your paranoia.</p>

<p>Personally I love the Left - they have taken it upon themselves to make Labour unelectable and, for once, they're working hard on the task in hand and not making a hash of things.</p>

<p>Talking of which, shouldn't you be off hunting red tories and not hanging out on the DT message boards?</p>

<p>You do not make value judgements? what about assumptions?</p>

<p>I make value judgements and assumptions, just not in the post you whined about.</p>

<p>You may not think you made value judgements of good or bad but in describing  "the left"  as those that "have taken it upon themselves to make Labour unelectable" i.e. not good for the Labour Party you imply  that they are bad and your mention of the moderates can only invite the obvious comparison<br/>And it wasn't a whine</p>

<p>Did you somehow miss the moment, earlier in the week, when Corbyn decided not to whip the Syria vote because of the possibility of half the shadow cabinet deciding to resign?</p>

<p>Corbyn's done a good job of consolidating his position within Labour but he's preaching to the choir and even Scotland, where the 'new politics' could be expected to have most traction, is proving strangely resistant to JC's offering. The country didn't vote Tory at the last election because they wanted more left wing policies so, yes, taking Labour further to the left is making them unelectable.</p>

<p>Whether that's a good thing or a bad thing depends on one's point of view.</p>

<p>Perhaps you missed that the most significant swing in Oldham was that away from the Tories. The last General election offered no alternative to the Tories except Nu Labour which is a tarnished brand with tarnished people and Tory in all but name. or  UKIP whose reason d'etre ceased to exist once Cameron agreed to a referendum. Those are also the reasons why the Scots voted the way that they did.<br/>Things are different now and while I'm not saying that Corbyn is the man to lead Labour into the sunlit uplands, his waving of his torch might just see the emergence of something better than we have.</p>

<p>A swing away from a Tory government at a by-election in a Labour safe seat isn't significant. UKIP's failure is far more significant.</p>

<p>The real significance is that moderate Labour MPs were hoping that the Oldham result would give them an excuse to have a pop at JC without appearing disloyal - now they've got to wait until the local elections in May unless someone in a more marginal seat draws a harp between now and then.</p>

<p>'Corbyn will never command majority support in the UK...'</p>

<p>That sounds like an assumption to me. His stance on Syria seems to have a majority backing for a start...</p>

<p>That's not an assumption, it's a nailed on certainty. I'd say exactly the same about someone like John Redwood.</p>

<p>To the extent that no political party has had majority (ie over 50% of the electorate) support for the last 100 years, I suppose you could say that's a certainty for any modern political figure. Not sure how that gets you though.</p>

<p>Perhaps we could agree if it was re-phrased as 'sufficient support to form a majority government'.</p>

<p>I don't agree with that either, I'm afraid. Corbyn clearly has a lot of work to do with the PLP and the next GE is still a long way off, but I can certainly imagine him gaining widespread electoral support.</p>

<p>Give me 1000 to 1 about a hundred quid then?</p>

<p>Your preferred odds suggest you're in agreement with me - given that Paddy Power is offering 175:1 that Prince Harry marries Cheryl Cole (sic).</p>

<p>Paddy Power is (are) notorious for shaving the odds.<br/>Betfair will probably get you 500 to 1 the same bet.</p>

<p>But nothing is a nailed on certainty, as many a (broke) gambling man will tell you.</p>

<p>gaffes, gaffes, cameron is the chief gaffer</p>

<p>Music sweet music.  I cant wait to see them snarling and spitting when the electorate gets it wrong again.</p>

<p>How the heck can an electorate get it wrong!!</p>

<p>Ask the rabble who rioted when the Tories won in May.</p>

<p>you need too clear your head</p>

<p>is that the electorate?  I didnt see 40 million</p>

<p>The rabble seemed pretty upset at what the electorate had elected and seemed to be struggling with some very fundamental democratic concepts.</p>

<p>"The electorate enter the polling booth and through self interest and delusion vote the wrong way"   Neil Kinnock  last May.</p>

<p>I can find no record of Kinnock using those words ( if you have a link....) I can find quotes that shows him trying to come to terms with why people appear (to him) to vote against their own self interest and in doing which he may or may not have disparaged the electorate. Anyhow, notwithstanding that, the electorate always vote for what they they want and in doing so believe they are making the right choice in that respect, they are right,</p>

<p>exactly,  here is three minutes of him waffling around the subject, he seems to think it is an act of lunacy to vote in self interest.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pTtymxcrNs" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>Hence the reaction against "Nu Labour"</p>

<p>Oh and PS Cameron and co</p>

<p>All looking good for Corbyn in 2020 then.</p>

<p>That's the positive from last night the corbynites think they are onto a winner!!.</p>

<p>I know.</p>

<p>Listening to radio 2 and one has just been on saying he is a giant amongst men!!!, bless.</p>

<p>They must be broadcasting from Lilliput.</p>

<p>Five Live was the same today.</p>

<p>You know when you've just had the rug pulled from under your feet. When you realise everything  your best friend (The DT) has been telling you was completely wrong and lies. You can get a short feeling of euphoria before the crash happens and the truth dawns on you,,that whats happening to you here. Stay calm and it will pass : ))</p>

<p>I never read DT articles, they are largely nonsense.  This morning Nicky Campbell and  Kinnock Jnr. both agreed that anyone voting for military action in Syria was "a war monger"  That is a disgrace.</p>

<p>Calling people who didn't vote for military action "terrorist sympathisers" is a disgrace.</p>

<p>Nicky Morgan said Corbyn and McDonnell looked like terrorist sympathisers.</p>

<p>She's a joke of a politician and an embarrassment to women in politics.</p>

<p>She quoted their words, which are the words of sympathisers with terrorists.</p>

<p>No, a women in the audience asked her if she looked like a terrorist sympathiser, she said no, but Corbyn and McDonnell do.</p>

<p>As I said, she's not a person to be taken seriously with nonsense comments like that.</p>

<p>Yes, when she looks at the words he has spoken written down he looks like a terrorist sympathiser, how someone looks includes what they say and what they do.</p>

<p>She didn't say he sounded like one, she said he looked like one.</p>

<p>Embarrassingly childish comment.</p>

<p>I know,to say they "look" like sympathisers is playground stuff. She must have peered through their curtains on a night and saw them wearing balaclavas : ))</p>

<p>she quoted their words.</p>

<p>He didnt, he said some were and Corbyn is, his record and statements show it.</p>

<p>Actually he didn't say that either - his comment was 'You should not be walking through the lobbies with Jeremy Corbyn and a bunch of terrorist sympathisers.'</p>

<p>Which implies that he doesn't think Corbyn is one.</p>

<p>But he hoped that nobody do notice.</p>

<p>It implies that he is.  and many in Labour are.</p>

<p>No, it doesn't - he's distinctly separating Corbyn from that group. Even when trying to insult (and let's face it, he's had plenty of experience) Cameron gets it wrong.</p>

<p>Corbyn does not agree to bombing anyone at any time, it took him three attempts to say the police should shoot an armed terrorist in a hostage situation. What else is that other than having sympathy for a terrorist?   I dont mind him being pacifist and cuddling up to every scumbag he can find so long as he admits that is what he does, and has done throughout his career.</p>

<p>He had 13 opportunities to clear that up in the commons and refused to.</p>

<p>Why should he, he had no need to apologise, the opposition went on at him for 30 minutes after spending 20 minutes saying there was not enough time to debate the issue.  Corbyn is a terrorist sympathiser, live with it.</p>

<p>MPs from every party in the house asked him to clear it up. Him and Gideon just smirked at each other like petulant children.</p>

<p>He said if you vote against you will be walking through the lobby with terrorist sympathisers Corbyn and O Donnell are terrorist sympathisers. There is that "cleared up" it was always perfectly clear.</p>

<p>So is every party leader then. They all talk to terrorists in the end. Its how peace happens : ))</p>

<p>They dont express sympathy with their cause as Carbyn frequently has.</p>

<p>Example of him expressing sympathy, if you don't mind...</p>

<p>As read out on Question Time last night,  its easy to find and there are other examples.</p>

<p>I know you'll just blather on about BBC lefty bias etc, but don't you ever stop to consider that - maybe, just maybe - far more voters actually respond to and agree with Corbyn's approach and views than you would like to believe?</p>

<p>You are wasting your time talking to plmungtrvcds, as he believes and I quote "Socialists are just filth, once you realise that it is all much more easily understood."</p>

<p>One can only go on the reaction of those around you the msm is corrupt so not the best indication.<br/>i can tell you that on a building site which the majority are probably Labour Corbyn is not looked upon in a good light.</p>

<p>I agree with you that the MSM is not very reliable as a bellwether. From day one, it has been, pretty much universally, virulently anti-Corbyn.</p>

<p>Yet, Labour Party membership has risen at an unprecedented rate since he won the leadership, the majority agree with his stance on Syria and his Party did much, much better than anyone predicted in the Oldham by-election. I'm not sure those actual indicators match your 'building site' experience.</p>

<p>same with all my mothers Labour pensioner friends.</p>

<p>Not really,  as I saw it Corbyn was humiliated by his own foreign minister in the commons, wait until he starts talking Corbynomics.</p>

<p>As opposed to Osborne's excellent, well-thought-through and clearly very successful economic strategy?</p>

<p>It will sound that way when Corbyn starts.</p>

<p>"So now we know the formula for a Labour win. After Oldham West and Royton we can see what is needed is a Blairite candidate, a Blairite speech on security in the Commons and total censorship of the leader. Simples."</p>

<p>Not to mention biradari politics, a stack of postal votes...and a pen.</p>

<p>Awww, poor little ukipper. Have a sweet tea to rinse out the taste of those sour grapes.</p>

<p>No not a Kipper, but I do have some concern as to how I'm governed and by whom.<br/><a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/oldham-named-election-fraud-hotspot-6479987" rel="nofollow">http://www.manchestereveningne...</a><br/>Do I get the feeling that, provided your side won, you wouldn't be so picky?</p>

<p>Nope. I think that our electoral system is fundamentally undemocratic and unfit for purpose, and until it changes, we will always be held to ransom by a bunch of essentially conservative swing voters in the South. That's why most politicians can't say what they really think and most voters can't vote for what they want. And the Union with Scotland remains at serious risk. To have such a repulsive and incompetent government thrust on us by only 37% of the electorate is a disgrace. Electoral fraud should worry all decent people, but luckily there will be plenty of evidence to back up the allegations...</p>

<p>Time to review the postal vote...</p>

<p> We had this in 2014 and nothing has changed.</p>

<p>Police across the UK have been asked to investigate more than 50 allegations of electoral fraud related to Thursday's elections in areas previously identified as vulnerable to vote-rigging, new figures show.</p>

<p>Officers in Manchester, Bradford, London and Birmingham have begun inquiries after receiving complaints about "ghost" voters, false statements by candidates and multiple attempts to vote by a single person.</p>

<p>The inquiries have emerged after the Guardian contacted police forces covering 16 areas that the elections watchdog has identified as being vulnerable to electoral fraud, particularly around the use of postal votes.</p>

<p>As well as Birmingham and Bradford, they include Blackburn with Darwen, Burnley, Calderdale, Coventry, Derby, Hyndburn, Kirklees, Oldham, Pendle, Peterborough, Slough, Tower Hamlets, Walsall and Woking.</p>

<p>West Yorkshire police, whose officers serve Bradford where former councillors have been imprisoned for electoral fraud, said they had received 21 allegations of electoral irregularities.</p>

<p>DI Ian Lawrie, of protective services (crime), said: "We have currently had 21 allegations that have been recorded for further investigation for election-related incidents. These include a number of matters under the Representation of the People Act 1983."</p>

<p>Woking?!?!?</p>

<p>Have UKIP had their press conference yet?  Do they have a coherent line on what happened yesterday or are they still all arguing in the pub?</p>

<p>Winning is the new failure?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>Winning yes</p>

<p>The tories failed in  May they only got 27% of the vote is what labour people keep telling me.</p>

<p>Your point in the context of my post was?</p>

<p>ISIS is the new Assad.</p>

<p>I've got this barrel John, would you mind scraping the bottom of it for me please?</p>

<p>He could do with a new barrel. His own one has nothing left to scrape. Bitter, bitter, bitter. If Labour had lost I doubt he would be saying that had nothing to do with Corbyn.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be great if even one of them could just admit they got it totally wrong?</p>

<p>To find a slimy past its best Corbyn supporter. Yuk.</p>

<p>Umm...well thanks for playing anyway.</p>

<p>Sorry, was it too difficult for you to understand?</p>

<p>Oh dear, I was trying to save you from any further embarrassment...</p>

<p>Ha ha, I've been playing this game much longer than you sonny.<br/>You are such an amateur - and it shows.</p>

<p>I'm sure that's right - your many years of experience are clearly showing through.</p>

<p>God you're boring.</p>

<p>By contrast, you're hilarious.</p>

<p>zzzzzzzz</p>

<p>Sleep well - I'm sure someone will wake you when Ukip become relevant.</p>

<p>Ukip or tory, whichever keeps labour in the quiet backwaters of politics, where they belong.</p>

<p>Ahh, so you're a Ukip supporter out of expediency, not conviction? Not only noble, but backing a winning team - go boris!</p>

<p>Keeping you lot out is so important - must needs etc. Mind you if you keep Corbyn it'll be so much easier.</p>

<p>Ditto Farage - but I imagine he'll 'resign' again soon enough.</p>

<p>Paid your US taxes yet?</p>

<p>What are you on about? As if I could give a toss really.</p>

<p>Google Boris US Taxes.</p>

<p>Try looking at my avatar, "Meet Boris, my preferred choice over Cameron."</p>

<p>Dork.</p>

<p>I think we are all struggling to get a coherent handle on who you are and what you represent.</p>

<p>I'll spell it out for you shall I? I am a Ukip supporter, Boris is the name of a toy monkey and would make a far better PM than Cameron - hence Borisforpm.</p>

<p>Thanks for caring.</p>

<p>Is he, like, the UKIP mascot?  Or just your own creation?</p>

<p>You've lost the plot mate.</p>

<p>A thumping victory for Labour which no one saw coming, least of all the idiots who write Op-Ed pieces for the Telegraph.</p>

<p>The result is also the final nail in the coffin for UKIP, but that's another story.</p>

<p>No one except the postman - apparently !</p>

<p>He deserves a bonus, for sure!</p>

<p>How many final nails have been used for this coffin?</p>

<p>Need a lot.  Farage refuses to accept he is dead.</p>

<p>Nor do his 4,000,000 voters</p>

<p>Tower Hamlets up t'North.</p>

<p>Exactly..</p>

<p>If we had PR, UKIP would have about 100 MPs..</p>

<p>Actually about 82 seats, based on UKIP's 12.6% of the vote share in May 2015 of the 650 seats.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/election/2015/results" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.com/news/electi...</a></p>

<p>Despite being mainly a Jeremy Corbyn supporter I agree with you - we need a full system of PR to represent all British views, not just extremist ones on either the right - which as far as I'm concerned are represented by our current government - or extremist ones on the left - which I don't however agree is what Jeremy Corbyn represents, though possibly some extremist union members do represent such views.</p>

<p>Mr Farage let himself down badly in a recent article in the DT in which he said Jeremy Corbyn wouldn't do shoot to kill - Mr Corbyn explained that verbatim on Sunday morning's Andrew Marr show that he would certainly approve shoot to kill in an ongoing terrorist attack, but just not shoot to kill on mere suspicion, as happened in the case of the murdered Brazilian student boy on the Tube, killed by our police/security forces.</p>

<p>Oh okkaay.</p>

<p>So if you had been sitting next to the 'student boy' and police <br/>suspicions had been right but they did nothing would be fine by you..</p>

<p>Don't bother , Polly doesn't 'get' numbers.</p>

<p>Isn't psittacosis a notifiable disease?</p>

<p>if elephants had wings they would fly!</p>

<p>If Labour had a proper leader it would be a miracle.</p>

<p>Dodos had wings and couldn't fly.</p>

<p>So did Paul McCartney</p>

<p>I expect they could originally - just failed to move with the times.</p>

<p>Nothing stands still, that's for sure.</p>

<p>Some years ago a High Court judge said our voting system would shame a banana republic:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2005/apr/04/localgovernment.politics" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/soc...</a></p>

<p></p>

<p>In local elections people tend to vote for the personality, not just the party because they know the competence of the local MP will effect theirs lives far more than far London . For Labour voters to change from Labour to UKIP the UKIP candidate would have to be much stronger than the Labour one. It doesn't look like this was the case. UKIP won't win local elections until they have candidates that are cleverer, harder working, and much more PR savvy than the opposition.  What I'm seeing around my part of the country are UKIP candidates who are passionate, but woefully unprofessional and frankly none to quick on their feet during a debate.</p>

<p>My local UKIP candidate thinks the Moon Landing was faked.</p>

<p>My Tory MP hates f a g g o t s and wouldn't vote same sex marriage. Demoted by Cameron, now has a second job. </p>

<p>Exactly.  You can like or dislike Farage and the upper echelon...but would you vote for a local nutter to represent you, even if you like UKIP's positions? Not likely. UKIP is a young party and by that I mean the leadership needs some sorting out and practice in electioneering. Extremists and nutters missing teeth aren't going to win seats.</p>

<p>Remember Winston McKenzie?</p>

<p>My landing is at the top of the stairs.</p>

<p>Nigel Farage did really well quadrupling UKIP's vote at the general election.</p>

<p>BNP in 2010 GE: 550,000 votes.<br/>BNP in 2015 GE: 1,600</p>

<p>Doesn't take much to work out where the votes went.</p>

<p>1 + 1 = 3.457 !?</p>

<p>So.. ?</p>

<p>So that's how Farage did it. He even said he was "proud" to have captured the BNP vote.</p>

<p>..and the problem is?</p>

<p>You said he did really well to increase the vote. All I am saying is that he encouraged the BNP vote to switch to UKIP.</p>

<p>Good for him, I suppose. But that is a one-off. There are no more BNP votes to be scooped up.</p>

<p>God you are so boring. How do you know these alleged votes didn't go elsewhere? You don't.</p>

<p>You're right - they all voted for the Green Party.</p>

<p>Perhaps, another bunch of nutjobs</p>

<p>Another, as in UKIP and the Greens are both nut-jobs?</p>

<p>You said BNP might have gone Green. I agree. 2 sets of nutjobs</p>

<p>Of course, they went to UKIP. UKIP is the new anti-immigration (single issue) party and the natural home for erstwhile BNP supporters.</p>

<p>Of course they did. With all that overwhelming evidence of yours.</p>

<p>Well, that's what Farage said. Take it up with him.</p>

<p>VOTE ICKE</p>

<p>Vote anything but Labour.</p>

<p>Too late Polly tooo late!!</p>

<p>ICKE should be leader of UKIP</p>

<p>More credible, certainly.</p>

<p>Despite your repeated assertations you couldn't get in at Parish level let alone any higher tier of Govt</p>

<p>Eh? I mean - <i>eh?</i></p>

<p>You talk the talk but don't walk the walk. Stand and be counted. I did.</p>

<p>And how did you do?</p>

<p>WON</p>

<p>Should you be out doing constituency work</p>

<p>Parish and District</p>

<p>Do you think the moon landing was faked?</p>

<p>Well ten thousand seems an impressive majority and even more so if 9,999 of them were guys called Mo'.</p>

<p>This writer is famed for his 'love' of Tony Blair and it was on Blair's watch that the postal vote scam started to take hold. There was an article in this paper not so long back by Pickles who pointed out that democracy in this country is actually under more threat from within, than without.</p>

<p>This was always a Labour seat so it doesn't make much difference in the wider scheme of things but it does - or should - leave people wondering how many seats at the last election were the result of this type of operation.</p>

<p>We all know how it works and we know which demographic uses this fraud - and that's what it is - to the greatest effect.</p>

<p>It may well be that 1945 - 2000 was the high point of representative democracy, untainted and uncorrupted in this country. We've now past that high point and an increasing number of elections are going to 'swing' on this type of action. We had rotten boroughs in the past but slowly got rid of them and the period above was largely corruption free.</p>

<p>What's now coming will be markedly less so, unless someone somewhere is prepared to act on this. And the whole 'postal voting' system needs drastic revision. One man or one woman one vote is still worth fighting for. Or at the very least kicking up one hell of a fuss about.</p>

<p>Unless our resident Trolls are keen to see the 'Tower Hamlet - isation' of the whole voting process ? It hasn't decided the Government yet. But there will come a time, not too far off, when it does. That will be the tipping point.</p>

<p>As you say this has been a problem for some time and the consensus seems to be, that if fraud is taking place, it benefits Labour more than anyone. So why has a Tory led government not addressed the problem in six years.</p>

<p>Absolutely 100% right..</p>

<p>Labour win in Oldham, another victory for David Cameron as Corbyn limps on and a Blairite takes his place amongst the Labour ranks. Hilary Benn and Co will need to think seriously now about whether they have to split the party.<br/>Meanwhile the police are trawling social media for all the death threats sent to Labour MPs over the past week or so.<br/>UKIP under the clown Farage limps off into the distance.<br/>What a sad state of affairs British politics has become</p>

<p>"victory for David Cameron"<br/> You haven't got a clue have you? The biggest swing of all was that away from the Tories and not to UKIP as you forecast. Didn't you check with your mum's knitting group on this one?</p>

<p>Farage is a liability with his pathetic whining.<br/>UKIP needs a leader with vision.<br/>DAVID ICKE</p>

<p>Nigel Farage is a great leader and quadrupled UKIP's vote at the GE..</p>

<p>While losing 50% of the Party's seats and failing to get elected himself.</p>

<p>If Douglas Carswell never defected, UKIP would have no MPs.</p>

<p>If Cameron stood down we would get an PM with a spine</p>

<p>He is a whining git.</p>

<p>No..</p>

<p>Hush now. You are getting over tired.  It can be exhausting cutting and pasting so many times. Why don't you have a lie down?</p>

<p>Nigel Farage quadrupled UKIP's vote and forced Dave to grant an EU referendum so he has done really well.</p>

<p>There there. You lie down. Maybe you will have a nice dream about Mr Farage. Maybe that one where he becomes Prime Minister.You like that one.</p>

<p>That is a silly post.</p>

<p>Shush</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>You know what happens when you get over tired, you are grumpy for the rest of the day. Go and have a nap. This will all still be here when you wake up.</p>

<p>That applies to you.</p>

<p>Another one from the Sun, this is classic UKIP. They need to improve their education policy.</p>

<p>"While white-working class voters have turned away from Labour, party sources predicted that their vote would hold up in the Asian community that makes up 24 per cent of voters.</p>

<p>Mr Farage said: “If this by-election was in one of dozens of other constituencies in Northern England, we would have won it comfortably.”"</p>

<p>Labour = 62%<br/>UKIP = 23% ( -39% )</p>

<p>I'm also not sure where in Northern England he thinks does not have a non-white English community of some sort.</p>

<p>From the Sun "Nigel Farage has claimed Ukip would “have walked’ today’s by-election in Oldham if it had not been for Asian voters in the Greater Manchester seat" Perhaps he should have thought about that before contesting the seat and claiming a victory before a vote was even posted .. doh! <br/>The irony is that UKIP's popularity level almost mirrors the level of immigrants in the country.... is there a conspiracy somewhere? and does Nigel secretly want immigration to reach over 50%?</p>

<p>Err ... do have any idea of what you are talking about?</p>

<p>Farage hates migrants.</p>

<p>But up until yesterday, he loved immigrants.</p>

<p>That has obviously changed.</p>

<p>I hope poor old Paul Browne, Biffoo, Zydor and Are You Sure didn't lose any money by foolishly betting on UKIP to win the by-election.</p>

<p>lol, who bets on a bi-election.<br/>I think most Tories will be over the moon that Corbyn has this in his bag, it keeps him at the head of Labour and that can only be a good thing.</p>

<p>Didn't you predict Corbyn will be gone by 11 December? Tick tock...</p>

<p>Yesterday you were so very very certain UKIP would win. <br/>Two weeks ago you were certain Corbyn would be gone by this Sunday.<br/>I'd give the Nostradamus thing a rest if I were you.<br/>You're cr@p at it.</p>

<p>Corby must take this vote as a ringing endorsement of his magnificent leadership skills, and his new Left Wing Labour Party.</p>

<p>But he must push to the extreme left now.</p>

<p>Deselect MPs that went against him in the Syria vote. Purge the Party of all those who disagree.</p>

<p>Lay out his plans for a truly Left Wing Government for 2020.</p>

<p>The UK Electorate will absolutely love it and are putty in his hands now.</p>

<p>Go back to your constituencies Labour MPs, and prepare for future Government!</p>

<p>the public will never vote for a loony left party. you are living in cuckooland.</p>

<p>dionysos...you thought I was being serious...really?</p>

<p>Lol..</p>

<p>Its amazing that UKIP supporters cannot accept the democratic decision without blaming anybody but themselves for their disastrous result. The truth is that the Leave the EU campaign is more popular than UKIP so any polls relating to referendum opinions no longer reflect UKIP's popularity. Farage is a liability and the one MP UKIP do have is now a pariah within the party. The UKIP PLP is made up of a party rebel. You couldn't make it up.</p>

<p>You can,and do.</p>

<p>Yet you just have ...</p>

<p>Lose Farage. Replace with David Icke.</p>

<p>It is amusing to watch Labour "left" and "right" abuse each other here on a forum for the "Tory-graph"!!</p>

<p>No ifs or buts.....Labour won. Wake-up Olde England we've welcomed a 5th column into our midst - mostly passive, but containing some murderous elements. Multicultural? Tolerated at best. We can't turn the clock back 25 years. Someone out there will have a final solution and then no-one will be safe. .</p>

<p>There is no reason why Labour should genuinely increase their share of the vote when Labour is so useless and so unpopular.</p>

<p>You know before when I said you were a moron?<br/>Your comment is like saying there is no reason for a Team to have 'genuinely' won the game just because they got more goals than the opposition.</p>

<p>Because they had 20 players, lol...</p>

<p>I'm going to type this really slowly so you will understand it. Labour get votes from people who think they are the best option on the ballot. They win. Less people vote for UKIP. So they lose. Your argument is 'This can not be true because I think UKIP are more popular than Labour'. Christ on a bike how dim are you?</p>

<p>I didn't say that so you're wrong again I'm afraid..</p>

<p>You said -There is no reason why Labour should genuinely increase their share of the vote when Labour is so useless and so unpopular.</p>

<p>Now try really really really hard and think about it. Who are Labour unpopular with? Is it the people who just voted for them? Or is it you and your pandemonium?</p>

<p>You were wrong about what I said..</p>

<p>No I was correct but you are a bit 'different' and I do not want to be accused of Cyber bullying someone who is a special snowflake</p>

<p>You're still wrong I'm afraid..</p>

<p>Hush now.</p>

<p>You were wrong about what I said of course..</p>

<p>Nigel was heard saying,show me the way to the nearest bar.Oh, don't ask why</p>

<p>Labour MPs have been whipped into not referring to bars or alcohol for fear of upsetting the majority of their voters.</p>

<p>Whilst UKIP knows that being inebriated is a requirement in order to vote for them.</p>

<p>Err .. says some with that nom de plume?!</p>

<p>Shame you do not understand irony ...</p>

<p>Perhaps I do as a teetoal</p>

<p>Yeah, nice try ...</p>

<p>A large majority of UKIP voters miss their mouths when they try to drink</p>

<p>Wow, what a profoundly erudite comment ...</p>

<p>The doors are open. to the nearest exit</p>

<p>How Weill</p>

<p>'There was uproar on the day of the vote when three "unexplained", unsealed ballot boxes appeared at the count and were included, along with a plastic bag stuffed with votes for Labour.'</p>

<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1487145/Labour-activists-had-vote-rigging-factory-to-hijack-postal-votes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</a></p>

<p>irrespective of your party allegencies  we should all be concerned that nothing is being done about postal fraud, the only way is to strip it down to genuine cases who can't make it to the polling stations.</p>

<p>Perhaps there isn't any and it's just an excuse for losing? Otherwise they would investigate, surely.</p>

<p>Still, we should have an investuigation, and find out if Tower Hamlets was the only example of voter fraud.</p>

<p>sour grapes</p>

<p>Well if GCHQ are really reading all our emails then they know how we vote.<br/>Perhaps you could just be notified how you voted at election time. It would save the walk to the Polling station. UKIP would still lose though.</p>

<p>There's a dangersous pattern emerging here:  Corbyn elected leader by 60% of party members, Labour candidate elected by 60% of voters in by-election.....</p>

<p>The wonders of Labour postal votes, lol..</p>

<p>How many postal votes did he get? Or are you just grasping at straws?</p>

<p>Only 7000 votes were postal from reports, the wonders of democracy and not being popular.</p>

<p>Pity UKIP voters can't understand Postal votes. I suppose if you go to vote you just have to put an X. Posting an envelope is probably beyond them. Sad really.</p>

<p>You have finally OD on the ex-lax and it is plainly showing in your post.</p>

<p>Where have you been? It is awful here. I think the WIFI is out at the Golf club and all the Kippers are drunk.</p>

<p>UKIP voters are honest of course.</p>

<p>Yes but they would put the envelopes in toasters, CD players etc.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>For much the same reason numbers confuse you.</p>

<p>Your post makes no sense..</p>

<p>This from a bird who thinks the ONLY way Labour was elected in a traditional Labour area was fraud.</p>

<p>Yes I agree, she forgot corruption.</p>

<p>I didn't say that.</p>

<p>You didn't actually say anything. You just cut and pasted articles from other newspapers.</p>

<p>Oh you mean you were wrong. Well I knew that already of course.</p>

<p>How do manage to walk without falling over?</p>

<p>How do you manage to walk at all with your use of ex-lax resulting in your user name?</p>

<p>What are you waffling about now?</p>

<p>Oh it wasn't Bennite it was Cavorite. <br/>And it wasn't Bernard Cribbens either, that was 'The Mouse on the Moon'.<br/>My mistake.</p>

<p>To be fair, if you corrupt the electoral process with false postal votes, you are probably going to win.</p>

<p>Says someone who uses a swastika on their avatar!</p>

<p>And if you win even if you discount the postal votes? Some of which will have been UKIP I assume as well as others.</p>

<p>Win should be in inverted commas..</p>

<p>Labour lost the general election by miles and now has the most unpopular leader ever..</p>

<p>They will be around for as long as they are useful to the real power brokers.</p>

<p>Oh Labour is definitely finished then..</p>

<p>"...the Blairite warmongering traitors"</p>

<p>Obviously, irony isn't an essential part of the Nazi ideology that you cling to with such zeal. Your boys were the enemy 70 years ago, and you would be the traitorous enemy today if you weren't such a pathetic, impotent nonentity.</p>

<p>Your fantasy that I'm Desi, the Catholic bog cleaner in France might be ludicrous, but not as ludicrous as your fantasy that you're a 'professional engineer' who's employed by a UK based German company on a salary of several hundred thousand pounds...which is paid to you on a 'financial year' basis. Oh...and they not only pay you that whopping salary, they also give you Fridays off!</p>

<p>So what's the strategy with 'Did it Happen'? Is it to build up as many comments as possible without including your trademark antisemitic abuse, and then pop up with a second, disposable account whenever there's an article on Israel or something related to Judaism, from which you can spew your usual bile? I mean...that little plan's worked so well for you in the past, I definitely think you should stick to it going forward. </p>

<p>hahahahahahahahaha - Best news in ages. Corbyn stays as Labour Leader.<br/>Unelectable in any language.</p>

<p>By having a Blairite elected?</p>

<p>I didn't understand that either. I wonder which way this guy would have voted in the commons this week.</p>

<p>From the Daily Telegraph..</p>

<p>Typical of the victims were pensioners Mr and Mrs W in Bordesley Green, who were visted one night by a young man claiming to be from the council collecting ballot papers.<br/>Mrs W, 77, said: "He told me to fill it in as he was standing there and asked me to put a cross in all three boxes for the main parties, which I did. I didn't think it was right but I knew it was a new system and he said he was from the council and so I presumed he knew what he was talking about."<br/>Mr W, 80, later discovered that the signature on his ballot was forged by the time it was entered into the election.<br/>During investigations by The Telegraph, other allegations were made, including an attempt by Labour activists to bribe postmen to hand over blank ballots without going through the "middle men" of the voters.<br/>One illiterate man is said to have had his name used on more than 50 ballot papers. Activists stood over voters while they filled in their form, pressuring them to vote Labour.<br/>The hearing was told that the Labour candidates opened sealed papers before changing the vote and re-sealing them, knowing that checks by the council were useless to stop them.<br/>There was uproar on the day of the vote when three "unexplained", unsealed ballot boxes appeared at the count and were included, along with a plastic bag stuffed with votes for Labour.</p>

<p>"From the daily Telegraph" That's why no one believes a word of it.</p>

<p>I would think it would be in Labours interest to disprove it?</p>

<p>They don't have to that's up to the accusers. That's the way it normally works isn't it?</p>

<p>An opportunity to show up UKIP sits in front of them.</p>

<p>You must have missed what Corbyn said about his approach to politics.</p>

<p> In any event let the accusers take any evidence and give it to the relevant authorities. That shouldn't be too difficult, as there a many on this board who are sure fraud has taken place so they must have evidence, they should inform their local police.</p>

<p>An opportunity to show up Labour sits in front of them.</p>

<p>I believe they already have.</p>

<p>Well then in that case things should work out fine</p>

<p>We shall have to wait and see.</p>

<p>That was in 2005 in Birmingham and the culprits were caught. Desperate times for UKIPers obviously. Perhaps you have a recent quote from Enoch Powell to share?</p>

<p>Actually Lord Hattersley on immigration is even more priceless.</p>

<p>Labour candidate elected in traditional Labour constituency.<br/>Dopey racist party come second.<br/>Nigel Frange whines about it.<br/>Not really news at all.</p>

<p>From the Daily Telegraph..</p>

<p>'There was uproar on the day of the vote when three "unexplained", unsealed ballot boxes appeared at the count and were included, along with a plastic bag stuffed with votes for Labour.'</p>

<p>Lol !</p>

<p>Maybe the NWO got the Illuminati to open a Stargate so the Freemasons could deliver extra votes just in time. You know, like when they arranged 9/11</p>

<p>From the Daily Telegraph..</p>

<p>At the height of the skulduggery was a "vote-rigging factory" set up by Labour activists in Aston and run from a disused warehouse. There the three candidates and their supporters altered bags stuffed with ballots to ensure that they were elected.</p>

<p>A midnight raid by police on the eve of the election found them sitting at a table with hundreds of unsealed postal votes scattered on a table in front of them. The find proved to be the tip of the iceberg.</p>

<p>They had collected the ballots in a variety of ways. The most common was to get hold of a copy of the electoral register, apply for a postal ballot in someone else's name and have it sent to a "safe" address where it could be picked up.</p>

<p>This could then be submitted with a forged signature and false witness confirmation, and the ballot could be accepted. Another method was to get activists to go door to door collecting papers, signed or unsigned, which could then be doctored..</p>

<p>By your reckoning which I don't doubt, they'll be a lot of people in Oldham today with ink on more than one finger.</p>

<p>It was interesting the first time I saw it. Scroll down, she has pasted the same thing 9 or 10 times. To be fair she does not understand numbers and her take on percentages would be funny if it wasn't so sad.</p>

<p>That is not the point of course.</p>

<p>The point is that there is no reason why Labour should genuinely increase their share of the vote when Labour is so useless and so unpopular.</p>

<p>YOU think Labour is unpopular so YOU think they should get less votes. Facts must really screw up your view of the world.</p>

<p>Labour is unlikely ever to be in power again.</p>

<p>So this time Yesterday you must have been looking forward to the great UKIP victory.</p>

<p>Bye bye useless Labour..</p>

<p>Labour have a long future as second party in the Country. I paid my £3 and voted for Wolfie Smith hoping this would be the case.</p>

<p>Desperate, desperate stuff by McTernan and other Blairite shills today - amusing though! One article said something like "Corbyn was INVISIBLE in the Oldham campaign" - as if voters in Oldham don't know who the leader of the Labour Party is when he's mentioned by every newspaper pretty much every day!</p>

<p>What is a Blairite? Someone who leads Labour to victory?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>But he was Labour wasnt he? He was cheered everytime he spoke until he stepped down wasnt he?  He was a Labour hypocrite wasnt he, like all Labour leaders.</p>

<p>Either way Labour is finished.</p>

<p>they fully understood ...he was a bit busy!!</p>

<p>As Mary Ann Siegart tells us in the Independent..</p>

<p>'British Asian politicians in Blackburn (and they're almost all Labour), she said, had imported practices from Pakistan and India. Some did favours in return for votes.</p>

<p>Some were sexist. They didn't have the interests of the whole community at heart. Worst of all, they put serious pressure on British Asian women to vote for them.</p>

<p>"Has anyone ever asked you to fill in a postal vote or to give them your postal vote so they can fill it in for you?" I asked.</p>

<p>"I think that's common practice in Blackburn, if I'm being honest," she said. Had it happened to her?</p>

<p>Yes'</p>

<p>wake up polly</p>

<p>Please Daily Telegraph its not "son of a truck driver" its "son of a Lorry driver". We are not a state of the USA yet.</p>

<p>Dude. Like. Whatever.</p>

<p>OMG,............ A stunning analysis,............... LMFAO</p>

<p>If Labour would've lost, it would've been all down to Corbyn. Because he's won, now apparently it's nothing to do with Corbyn. The agenda is incredible.</p>

<p>The MSM will continue to hack away at and try to discredit Corbyn in the same way they have done and continue to do to Farage and UKIP. No surprises there.</p>

<p>Labour win but dodgy postal votes allegedly.</p>

<p>I agree that the postal voting system is not as secure and free from potential abuse., but you have to have evidence that someone has abused it. I could equally claim that UKIP have abused the postal vote because they realised that they were going to lose so they perverted the vote so that they could then claim a corrupted system.</p>

<p>Tower Hamlets.</p>

<p>Does it?<br/>Haven't heard of any reported complaints to the electoral commission, just whining from random people.</p>

<p>Mr Farage is not 'random people' he is a Professional Whiner</p>

<p>Labour win. UKIP lose. LOL</p>

<p>Labour may have won this battle (in one of their safest seats). But it had to mobilise the Asian 'community' to do it (and employ some very dodgy postal voting practises).</p>

<p>Good luck trying to win other seats around the country with that approach...</p>

<p>People now see the Labour party for what it is. Relying on the immigrant vote and the vote of those on welfare. A fantastic combination for you!</p>

<p>Corbyn stays, UK wins! Even more LOL.</p>

<p>Labour's block postal vote looks like a fix..</p>

<p>Tower Hamlets !</p>

<p>Are you a parrot because all you do is repeat the same thing?</p>

<p>C. I wish to make a complaint!</p>

<p>O: We're closin' for lunch.</p>

<p>C: Never mind that, my lad. I wish to complain about this parrot what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.</p>

<p>O: Oh yes, the, uh, the Norwegian Blue...What's,uh...What's wrong with it?</p>

<p>C: I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. 'shE's dead, that's what's wrong with it!</p>

<p>O: No, no, sh'e's uh,...she's resting.</p>

<p>C: Look, matey, I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one right now.</p>

<p>O: No no she's not dead, she's, she's restin'! Remarkable bird, the Norwegian Blue, idn'it, ay? Beautiful plumage!</p>

<p>C: The plumage don't enter into it. It's stone dead.</p>

<p>O: Nononono, no, no! 'shE's resting!</p>

<p>C: All right then, if she's restin', I'll wake her up!</p>

<p>(shouting at the cage)</p>

<p>'Ello, Miss Polly Parrot! I've got a lovely fresh cuttle fish for you if you show...(owner hits the cage)</p>

<p>O: There, she moved!</p>

<p>C: No, she didn't, that was you hitting the cage!</p>

<p>O: I never!!</p>

<p>C: Yes, you did!</p>

<p>O: I never, never did anything...</p>

<p>C: (yelling and hitting the cage repeatedly) 'ELLO POLLY!!!!!</p>

<p>Testing! Testing! Testing! Testing! This is your nine o'clock alarm call!</p>

<p>(Takes parrot out of the cage and thumps its head on the counter. Throws it up in the air and watches it plummet to the floor.)</p>

<p>C: Now that's what I call a dead parrot.</p>

<p>O: No, no.....No, 'she's stunned!</p>

<p>C: STUNNED?!?</p>

<p>O: Yeah! You stunned her, just as she was wakin' up! Norwegian Blues stun easily, major.</p>

<p>C: Um...now look...now look, mate, I've definitely 'ad enough of this. That parrot is definitely deceased, and when I purchased it not 'alf an hour ago, you assured me that its total lack of movement was due to it bein' tired and shagged out following a prolonged squawk.</p>

<p>O: Well, she's...she's, ah...probably pining for the fjords.</p>

<p>C: PININ' for the FJORDS?!?!?!? What kind of talk is that?, look, why did she fall flat on her back the moment I got her home?</p>

<p>O: The Norwegian Blue prefers kippin' on her back! Remarkable bird, id'nit, squire? Lovely plumage!</p>

<p>C: Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot when I got it home, and I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been NAILED there.</p>

<p>Don't give up your day job.</p>

<p>10,000 clearly fraudulent votes counted for some party called UKIP. What a disgrace.</p>

<p>Interesting how quickly John McTernan has become a figure of bemusement and ridicule in the social media. A rather bitter and twisted figure writing increasingly hysterical rants for his right wing masters. Articles which are increasingly seized on by a grateful left as evidence that the routed right sure are sore losers and not to be trusted..</p>

<p>As Harry Hill might say..John McTernan,,,more crazy articles...pleeeeease!'</p>

<p>I think the vile demos outside Labour party offices showed who are the sore losers,  Labour activists now being investigated for making death threats to Labour MPs.</p>

<p>Here's an account of what happened from someone who was actually there:</p>

<p> "OK - If you're worrying about activism in Walthamstow please read and share this.</p>

<p> I just want to set the record straight for anyone reading or listening to the news about Walthamstow and Stella Creasy which as far as I can tell is totally UNTRUE.</p>

<p> On Tuesday a local resident Sophie Bolt and Rev Steven Saxby<br/> organised a family vigil organised which myself and others helped to <br/>publicise quickly on social media. No one asked me to do it, I just did <br/>it.</p>

<p> It was a beautiful, calm meet-up of for anyone who wanted to<br/> come and wanted to show our MP Stella Creasy that we wanted her to vote<br/> NO on air strikes in Syria. We met at the Queen’s Road mosque with <br/>candles in jam jars and walked quietly to Stella’s Labour office on <br/>Orford road where there were speeches by religious and community <br/>leaders. It was a beautiful, community, inspiring family event of people<br/> trying to make their voices heard against the air strikes and trying to<br/> influence Stella, even though we knew she was in Westminster.</p>

<p>We took post-it notes and thought it would be powerful to write messages<br/> of peace and stick them on the office window. It looked beautiful and <br/>powerful.</p>

<p> The next day we realised someone called Paul S <br/>Jakubovic had put up a FB post on the Refugees Welcome UK website with a<br/> picture of the start of the vigil which was outside the mosque. You can<br/> see the mosque on the right if you zoom in, but mostly it's just the <br/>houses next to it, and he said we were outside Stella’s house and said <br/>something incendiary about her not having children to worry about. His <br/>exact post was: "“outside [her] house…apparently she has still to make <br/>up her mind – and she has no children to upset”. He managed to get some <br/>police in the pic which made it look like a demo and it was dark and <br/>blurry. In fact the very low police presence were very helpful and <br/>friendly throughout.</p>

<p> Then we went to her office about half a <br/>mile away. There were about 200 people including children and various <br/>community and religious leaders spoke - it was very inspiring peace <br/>rally. The police were laid-back and friendly there was no intrusive <br/>police presence.</p>

<p> NOW FOR THE MOST WORRYING THING - the picture <br/>and FB post message by Paul S Jakubovic was found by the Independent and<br/> used in an article about the social media activity lobbying Stella to <br/>vote No in Walthamstow started off a mass media misinformation story <br/>about constituents bullying Stella. It was then picked up by LBC, the <br/>Standard and many other media and went viral on social media. I tried to<br/> counteract lots of it, especially with journalists following up the <br/>story.</p>

<p> Then someone found out Paul S Jakubovic's FB account was <br/>created the night before and posted from Leeds although when I searched <br/>for him it says he lives in Orpington, Kent. Nowhere near Walthamstow! <br/>Now if you search for him his account won't open. He decided to use this<br/> peaceful family event to defame the peace actions of our amazing <br/>community! Why?? When I realised that the Independent had used <br/>his picture and post to create their story stating Stella was targeted I<br/> contacted the journalist and she has since amended the article, but <br/>already the story had gone all over the world. I was sobbing with <br/>frustration. Please share this version of events. There may of course be<br/> things I don’t know that happened separate to the vigil. All I know is <br/>the vigil was peaceful and no-threatening and the thousands of FB posts <br/>I’ve seen from Walthamstow residents are respectful but utterly <br/>desperate to share their views with Stella to vote NO. That is democracy<br/> - that is what she asked for. That is not bullying"</p>
