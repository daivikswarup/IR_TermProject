<p>Pretence is an integral part of the SNP's stock in trade. Pretend: that North Sea oil is a guaranteed and permanent money spinner; that Scotland is entitled to share the pound whatever the rest of the UK thinks; that Scotland is already an EU member in its own right; that Scottish MP's have the right to vote on English matters with no reciprocal right; and that the SNP can call another referendum on its own at a time of its own choosing.</p>

<p>All of these pretences were comprehensively discredited during the independence referendum but repeat them often enough and hope to embed them in voters' minds as givens.</p>

<p>It may work with what the Americans call low information voters and those who want independence at any price but there is another Scotland with its head screwed on which knows that it is as much part of the warp and weave of Britain as is independent Ireland.</p>

<p>It's impossible to escape geography and history. England may be the auld enemy - do the Irish say the ould enemy? - but in the end it is the only friend the Celts can rely on always.</p>

<p>I don't mean that Ireland would be tempted to leave the EU if the UK did but it would still maintain a special relationship with London.</p>

<p>So long as the Scots do not resolve the SNP's various pretences, they would be mad to leave the UK under any circumstances and certainly not in order to  become, as a starter country, a small and insignificant peripheral appendage of the deeply troubled EU.</p>

<p>Let the SNP have another referendum if that is what they want. Given that everyone in Europe (including the Scots) is appalled by the EU's failure to control immigration, the perceived failure off the Euro (which an 'independent' Scotland in the EU would have to join) and above all the collapse of the oil price, I very much doubt she would win.</p>

<p>In the unlikely case that she did, England could live quite happily without Scotland in the UK, just as it does now without Eire. Scotland, however, would find itself in the unenviable position of being not only small but poor. Under such circumstances, come the next election, the Scottish people would turf out Sturgeon (or whatever other fish is currently leading the SNP), elect a unity Government and open negotiations to re-join the UK and get back the pound. They may, however, find the terms a little less generous than they are now, with fewer MPs in Westminster and less money channelled up north for free prescriptions etc. Some victory.</p>

<p>I am always disappointed by the number of people in Telegraph threads referring disparagingly to "the Scots" as if we are a uniform mass of knuckle-draggers, all taken in by SNP hysteria and all as economically innumerate as Mr Salmond and his fellow-gonks. <br/>I am Scottish. I was born in Scotland. I speak Scots. I have lived in Scotland all my life. Like you and most Scots, I despair of nearly half of my compatriots' blind allegiance to the SNP and the promises the party knows it has not a hope of keeping. Far more than half of us saw through the nonsense, which was why they crashed at the 2014 referendum. <br/>Polls show that is not about to change any time soon. The appetite for independence is drifting away from them, thank goodness. Support in Scotland for a second referendum has gone from 39% last summer to 36% last week. <br/>SNP elder statesman Gordon Wilson has cautioned against a second run any time soon because he knows two-thirds of us are now weary of the constant independence blabber and wish the SNP would stop the posturing and get on with daily reality.<br/>This is why Ms Sturgeon is very careful to resist calls for a second referendum: she knows she hasn't a hope of winning. It's also why BBC Scotland's political editor, Brian Taylor, a close uni chum of Alex Salmond, has said he doesn't see Brexit as a trigger for a second referendum on independence for Scotland.</p>

<p>The problem is the anti-English &amp; anti-British rantings, bile and hate from the cybernats who post on here have taken their toll on the goodwill of everyone else.</p>

<p>Wee Jimmy Kranky (with her mate, Alex) was perfectly happy to take Scotland out of the EU, leaving the rest of the UK in it.</p>

<p>I wonder what changed when she lost her own referendum.</p>

<p>At least this time round it is a referendum open to ALL interested parties - i.e. the whole of the UK.</p>

<p>If the UK leaves the EU and Scotland stay in (Or negotiates to get in)will Scotland be a financial net contributor to the EU or a net recipient ?<br/>How much?<br/>Does anybody know?<br/>At least someone in Scotland must be at least asking these questions...musn't they?</p>

<p>Well, Ireland is comparable in size - initially in the early 2000s, Ireland received about Euro40 billion in net subsidies, by 2014 that was just under Euro 1 Billion.<br/>So I guess Scotland would receive a lot at the start and gradually (hope to) even out.<br/>However, we can only guess, as we have no way of knowing how many industries might leave an independent Scotland (especially those connected with UK Defence), and erratic oil prices may mean its economy fall behind Greece's.<br/>But, all we can do is guess.</p>

<p>Let's not forget that senior EUSSR Commissars made it clear that an Independent Scotland would have to apply to join and would not already be in the EU.</p>

<p>Wee Eck and Nippy Sweety dismissed these people as preposterous!</p>

<p>"Sturgeon" and "Salmond". LOL. Scots proved themselves cowards in their own  referendum</p>

<p>The English are paying for it, let them drop the pigs from the teat.</p>

<p>Does Nicola Sturgeon believe that her constant threats of a referendum is frightening the English ?</p>

<p>Everyone capable in Scotland needs to look at the economics of the situations that may arise post  the UK referendum vote.<br/>Information needs to be provided by the Scottish government relating to the potential economic outcomes if Scotland leaves the UK,stays with the UK inside the E Union  or even leaves the E Union and a European departed UK (So unlikely but...)<br/>They need to get a move on as otherwise the voters north of the border will have little to base their E Union voting intents on....</p>

<p>Correct it's not about the SNP. But then again, she is linking arms with Dave and Jeremy.</p>

<p>I think at the heart of it is a desire to be free from the lies and arrogance of Westminster as opposed to some hatred of the English.</p>

<p>The Scots have finally seen through Labour. For the SNP to achieve such a majority clearly many unionists voted for them, something Nicola Sturgeon has acknowledged. I think the secret to the SNP is a simple one, they select delegates that look, talk and think like the people they represent.</p>

<p>This is something the rest of the people of this island should applaud and emulate.</p>

<p>"The EU referendum is not all about Scotland. Can someone tell the SNP?"<br/>It is not all about the home counties and the south of England either. The southern little Englanders are not even respected by those ( like me ) who live in northern England. In fact in northern England there is considerable SNP Support.</p>

<p>Not in my part of northern England...</p>

<p>Labour has neglected their heartland, which is why "Red" UKIP did so well last May.</p>

<p>"Scottish voters are neither stupid nor ill-informed." The ones that voted for independence are one or both.</p>

<p>Sturgeon reminds me of Kristina Kirchner from Argentina. A serious chip on her shoulder.</p>

<p>You could argue she's pretty level headed.</p>

<p>She has a chip on both shoulders.</p>

<p>SNP/Go Leave* Manifesto   (* delete as required)</p>

<p>1.       We are a proud &amp; historic nation forced into an unjust Union we donâ€™t want<br/>2.       The Union has stolen our oil/money*<br/>3.       We demand the right to our own sovereign parliament in Holyrood/Westminster*<br/>4.       The existing Westminster/Brussels* parliament rides roughshod over our views as we have only 9.1%/9.7%* of the seats.<br/>5.       We totally disagree with the policies of Go Leave/SNP* to leave the EU/UK*</p>

<p>It's obviously in Sturgeon's benefit for the UK to remain in the EU. Otherwise she would not be banging on about hoping the UK vote to remain. If we remain in the EU, it gives her a better chance of independence via immigration and their continual push for refugees and economic migrants wandering around Europe. If we vote to leave, it cuts off her supply of immigrant voters. Simple, vote leave and save the Union. SNP will die by 2020.</p>

<p>If she carries on shaking her head the way she does when she chatters .. she looks as if she is solar powered like those little nodding monkeys  and penguins  one sees  on  windowsills</p>

<p>I always thought she reminds one of the Duracell Bunny - without the charm, of course.</p>

<p>Scotland is a bud at the end of a branch asking for independence from the roots. And the SNP are the shears.</p>

<p>And to extend the metaphor, the bud would fall down to the manure offered by membership of an EU that has a clear track record when it comes to small countries that cant control their spending.</p>

<p>Nicola Sturgeon has to be one of the most irritating women in history and the most boring.</p>

<p>A Leave outcome would change so much for everyone. The SNP are committed long term to independence and enjoy an enormous mandate; to decry them making hay out of what might be perceived as a crisis is naive and likely to be counter-productive. But let's have the UK Referendum first.</p>

<p>Just ignore them, they'll go away eventually.</p>

<p>Sturgeon is getting herself tied in knots. What will she do if, for example Scotland votes to leave the EU, against her wishes and the rest of the UK votes to stay in, which is what she wants. By somehow tying in the EU referendum to another indyref she is going to get a shock, whatever happens.</p>

<p>she is going to get a shock, whatever happens.<br/>That could be interesting, they might all have to pay for Further education and Hospital parking to try and make ends meet.</p>

<p>Apparently the UK is too wee, too poor and too stupid, or something.</p>

<p>None of the leaders of the main political parties in Scotland have children. In that sense, they are typical Europeans.</p>

<p>"Labourâ€™s track record in standing up to nationalist demands is not a <br/>good one. It has responded to every electoral reverse by offering ever <br/>more powers to its nemesis."<br/>As I recall, it was Dave that was all panicked and 'generous' in the run-up to the recent referendum.<br/>But, of course, the Holyrood elections come before the 'stay/run away' referendum. It surely cannot be denied that Corbyn's Labour Party has a good chance of upsetting the SNP's applecart then.</p>

<p>I said it 2 year ago and say it again ...</p>

<p>McCameron got the 2 Referendum the wrong way round.</p>

<p>The EU Referendum should have come first.</p>

<p>Don't agree with you very often, Tom. Personally I feel that Labour are defunct, delusional and will be consigned to the scrapheap of history.<br/>However, even more delusional are the SNP.<br/>Many of us Scots feel that the self proclaimed EU is oppressive and moving towards a totalitarian regime.<br/>My other half would love to vote out, but fears that a leave vote would lead to independence.<br/>Most of us do not succumb to Project Fear (you may be well experienced in this matter from the Indy ref).<br/>We believe in the Unitied Kingdom, it's values and the fact that we will be stronger out of the abomination which is the EU.<br/>Vote leave!</p>

<p>Surely the media are largely to blame, by beaming 'SNP warnings' to rUK, seemingly endlessly. Sturgeon has nothing else in her life beyond her rabid desire for independence, so by definition, she's irrelevant in the big scheme of things.</p>

<p>It's a shame the SNP didn't vote for oblivion last time, with their fantasy oil prices, whiskey revenues etc. They'd be blubbing into their manifesto by now.</p>

<p>If those of us in England, Wales and NI had no idea what Nicola Sturgeon was demanding, it would be better for us. There is no point trying to encourage dislike for the SNP, my understanding is that they are not even very popular in Scotland.</p>

<p>I am sure that the majority of Scots who told the SNP that they want to remain British are happy to vote as they feel come June 23rd.<br/>Had they voted for independence they would be out of the EU anyway.</p>

<p>If the majority of Scots vote to remain, but the rest of the UK say leave then Scots have a choice.</p>

<p>They can leave as part of the UK, or they can vote for independence and find themselves out of the EU but with an option of begging to get in.</p>

<p>Odd, though, that they would vote for independence, then, having achieved it, vote to be ruled by an unelected dictatorship in a faraway country that would allow them less say and influence than they would have as part of the UK.</p>

<p>But then this is not down to who runs Scotland, and is merely anti-English sentiment.</p>

<p>The Scots have hated the English since the 8th Century, and when the English saved them after Darien it must have burned them inside.</p>

<p>Still I wish our Caledonian cousins well.<br/>(Seriously, I am married to Highland Lassie, and she knows which side her bread is buttered and was wise enough to marry this Englishman!)</p>

<p>But your average Jock in the street must decide, in or out, and must be told that Out as part of the UK is better than In as an independent country.</p>

<p>"Had they voted for independence they would be out of the EU anyway"</p>

<p>the irony of which is completely lost on your average separatist who will go into melt down should 'the English' vote take us out of the EU.</p>

<p>Yes, indeed. Did you hear what the venerable Jim Sillars said last week. Something along the line of.... "the EU told Scotland to get stuffed at the referendum, so we should tell the EU to get stuffed now". What a proper "statesman" he has turned out to be.</p>

<p>it plays well to the neds though.</p>

<p>That, of course is the danger. Some will vote the right way for the wrong reasons, and some the other way round. It is all a total muddle and I cannot see a good conclusion, whatever happens.</p>

<p>The Scots hate the English more than they love themselves?</p>
