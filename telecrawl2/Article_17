</div><p></p><p> This was a fight won despite Jeremy Corbyn.

On nuclear weapons. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11947452/Does-Jeremy-Corbyn-have-any-idea-what-Poppy-Day-is-about.html" target="_blank">On Remembrance Sunday</a>. On the Royal Family and the national anthem. On all these issues Corbyn has created new doubts – often, indeed, certainties – among core Labour voters. The Tories have started punching the message home in their language – Corbyn is a threat to British security. Like the best focus group phrases rather than imposing language on them, it reflects their own thoughts and words back to them. And is therefore doubly devastating. </p><p> Labour threw everything at Oldham. A candidate who is one of the best local council leaders – a man, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/11979069/Labour-moderate-selected-to-stand-in-Oldham-by-election.html">Jim McMahon</a>, who would otherwise have likely been the Mayor of Greater Manchester and potentially one of the great figures in the renaissance of England’s great cities. Destined now for a decade, at least, on the opposition benches. They used their crack by-election team – who still have the best ground game in British politics. And they cashed every ounce of loyalty they had banked with the Asian population. But the disaffection that drives Labour voters to UKIP is still there and still real. </p><p> Remember why Labour lost the General Election. It is so many Corbyns – <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12020285/Last-week-was-nowhere-close-to-the-worst-of-Labours-history.-This-week-has-surpassed-it-in-so-many-ways.html" target="_blank">the term for the disasters which used to be once a decade and are now daily</a> – ago. Cast your mind back – it was because voters couldn’t trust Labour, as personified by the two Eds, on welfare, immigration and the economy. </p><p> The only movement on these issues has been backwards. John McDonnell’s idea of a "Magic Money Tree" is as laughable as his claim to financial expertise because he was once sacked as GLC Chair of Finance by Ken Livingstone. On welfare, Labour have tied themselves in knots while securing the identity of the scroungers’ friend. And on immigration they have said nothing. Which is just as well, since if Corbyn ever said what he thought about welfare then voters would have confirmation of what they merely suspect. </p><p> Still, it was a victory. </p><p> • <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/general-election-2015/parliamentary-constituencies/oldham-west-and-royton/12031040/oldham-west-royton-by-election-results.html">Oldham by-election: Follow latest reaction and analysis</a> </p></div>
