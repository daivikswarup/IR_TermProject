</div><p></p><p> Let's just take not merely the most proximate Labour disaster but the most damaging. True to his word, David Cameron <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/12018841/David-Camerons-full-statement-calling-for-UK-involvement-in-Syria-air-strikes.html" target="_blank">came to the Commons and set out the case for air strikes</a>. </p><p> In doing so he demonstrated why he is the Prime Minister – the first among equals. Calmly, confidently and eloquently he set out the arguments. He answered all the questions MPs raised. </p><p> In particular, he successfully addressed the seven questions raised by the Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee – Crispin Blunt, the Committee's Chair, announced that he was satisfied that their tests had been met. </p><p> <iframe frameborder="0" height="350" id="tweetframe" scrolling="no" src="http://renderer.qmerce.com/interaction/565832cf42f2dd112b4357ee" width="100%"></iframe></p><p> Rising to respond, Jeremy Corbyn triumphantly demonstrated why he will never be Prime Minister. It was hard to say what was worst. Was it the poor delivery? No, that is by now established and anticipated. Was it the scratchy and angry manner? No, that too is priced in. </p><p> It was the fact that it was absolutely clear that Corbyn had a closed mind. Nothing could possibly convince him to back action against ISIS. His truculent pacifism was well to the fore. Like a rebellious sixth former reading a lesson in chapel in a sarcastic voice, Corbyn gained great satisfaction from outraging government and opposition benches alike. </p><p> But this was merely the amuse bouche. For Corbyn, betrayal is like voting in Mayor Daley's Chicago – it has to be done early and often. </p><p>
