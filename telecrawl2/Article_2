<div class="body"><p> This obviously seemed a slightly contradictory stance. But he was only on screen for a short time, and the broadcasters had moved on to someone with more insight into the debate – it might have been Priti Patel – so I ignored it. Labour’s leader had spoken. He’d spoken utter gibberish, but it didn’t matter because no-one was paying attention. Once upon a time this would have been noteworthy. But in British politics, in 2016, it was just another day with a “y” in it. </p><p>

One of his staff had clearly also recognised his EU response was cutting through like a cold knife through titanium, and so given it another shove. </p><p> It was essentially the same <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12158633/Why-Jeremy-Corbyn-could-privately-support-Brexit.html" target="_blank">“Europe’s rubbish, we must remain in Europe”</a> line, until I reached the passage dealing with the new curbs on migrants’ benefits. “The evidence suggests that Cameron’s much-heralded 'emergency brake' on in-work migrants’ benefits will do nothing to cut inward migration to Britain,” he wrote. “Nor will it put a penny in the pockets of British workers. But there are dangers it could drive down pay rates still further as migrant workers take second jobs to make up for lower incomes”. </p><p> Danger. The Prime Minister secures – against expectations – a limit on benefits for migrant workers. And the Labour leader condemns him for it. What’s more, he doesn’t just argue it’s ineffectual, or irrelevant to the big issues of the day. Instead he explains how in his worldview, such restrictions are “dangerous”. </p><p> Set aside the impact that argument could have on the “Remain” campaign. Imagine the impact it’s about to have on the Labour Party. </p><p>

</div><p></p><p> Immigration is what people familiar with US subways would call the electrified third rail of politics: it carries the power to kill. In seats up and down the country – especially traditional working-class northern seats – Labour MPs are watching the inroads Ukip is making, precisely because it opposes immigration. And Labour’s leader is now saying he opposes restricting benefits for migrants. Or, to invert his case, he supports a policy of granting migrants unlimited access to those benefits. </p><p> Some Labour MPs will desperately argue Corbyn has stopped just short of opposing Cameron’s benefit deal. It’s nuance that will be lost on the public, and deliberately lost on Labour’s political opponents. Over the coming weeks and months Corbyn will asked to state unequivocally if he supports the policy. And if he says anything but “Yes”, Labour will be electorally torn to shreds. </p><p> Forget Trident. Forget shoot-to-kill. Forget printing money until the presses run dry. Nothing Jeremy Corbyn has done or said since he became leader has the potential to do more damage to his party than this. “Labour, the party that wants to let the immigrants in to soak up Britain’s benefits”. That’s not some an attack line dreamt up by Tory spinners. It’s official Labour Party policy. </p><p>

It’s a work of pure and evil genius to be able to say virtually nothing, but speak in such volumes. To conjure with contradiction and ambiguity, and discover such startling clarity. To embrace irrelevance yet become a figure of such malign significance to your own party. </p><p> The one thing of note Labour’s leader had said in relation to the referendum is something that has the potentia to hasten not just the decline of his party but its total extinction. You simply can’t take your eyes of Jeremy Corbyn.
