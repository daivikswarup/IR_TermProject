<p>The IRS' money grab from "accidental Americans" has finally bagged a big name... and he's fighting back.</p>

<p>As you might be already know, U.S. citizens are subject to income taxes <br/>no matter where in the world they earn that income. And as we mentioned <br/>last month, many people are U.S. citizens without even knowing it -- <br/>until the IRS tracks them down and demands they declare five years of <br/>back taxes under a "voluntary disclosure program."</p>

<p>The latest target -- London mayor Boris Johnson, touted sometimes as a future British prime minister.</p>

<p> NOT how Boris Johnson reacted to his U.S. tax bill;</p>

<p> his hair usually looks like this.</p>

<p>Mr. Johnson hasn't lived in the United States since age 5. But the IRS <br/>insists on collecting a cut of the capital gain he got from selling his <br/>U.K. home.</p>

<p>Asked by a U.S. public radio interviewer whether he would pay, he said, <br/>"I'm -- no, is the answer. I think, it's absolutely outrageous. Why <br/>should I?"</p>

<p>Hmmm... "The question," writes J.D. Tuccille at Reason, "is <br/>whether Johnson, as a connected political figure, makes separate peace <br/>with the IRS, emphasizing that the IRS' reach applies only to the <br/>powerless. That might have some interesting international ramifications.<br/> Or will he carve out a wider exception that gives others a little <br/>relief from America's official muggers?</p>

<p>"Or maybe the IRS will just exercise America's imperial muscle and try <br/>to make even Johnson turn out his pockets to demonstrate its power."</p>

<p>Stay tuned...</p>

<p>Well he should renounce any claim to citizenship and be off with them nasty Yanks.</p>

<p>We are on our way folks. . Put your money on us being the 'King Makers'</p>

<p>We'll keep Cameron in line for the good of ALL and create a truly 'One Nation' country. . We'll put all the 'Common Purpose' traitors out to grass, and prosecute all those that persist in their treacherous ways.</p>

<p>Vote UKIP on the 7th. May 2015. . We are getting our country back!!!!</p>

<p>End this conspiracy, and make Nigel Farage the deputy we can all trust to make sure  our borders are safeguarded once again.</p>

<p>Cameron leading the Tories into the 2015 GE is excellent news for UKIP.</p>

<p>"Lynette-Anne Watt, 26, who also lives on the Finsbury estate, said that she would not hang a St George's cross outside her own home because her children, who are aged five and seven, are black."</p>

<p>Does she not consider her children English because they are black? That's about as racist as it gets.</p>

<p>Black people cannot be waycist.</p>

<p>Now stop it, you know the rules!!!!!</p>

<p>A good night for racism.</p>

<p>There's an awful lot of anti-English trolls out tonight.  Have you not got diversity meetings to attend?</p>

<p>apparently they're on downvoting duties at the moment</p>

<p>Liberals are very liberal until there is something they do not like taking place, then they pull on their brown shirts red socialist arm  bands and jackboots.</p>

<p>The Beast of Bolsover shows our delicate Oxford PPE educated political leaders how to take down the liquid-lunch down the pub politics of UKIP (enjoy) :-</p>

<p>Dinosaur Dennis and Labour are an anachronism; legacy fools.</p>

<p>A bad night for democracy, a good night for racism, lunacy and the labour party.</p>

<p>Like your fellow five comment trick friends, the sincerity is lacking, the substance as light as thin air. You type this crap, do you think it will have any effect? Good luck ,you're going to need it.</p>

<p>A good night for democracy, a bad night for the undemocratic  EU.</p>

<p>Having heard Mark Reckless's comment about repatriation it occurred to me that UKIP is showing itself to be a posher form of the BNP, but they are too artful to actually own up to the similarity.  Just give them a bit longer and all will be revealed. They seem to be stealing the BNP's thunder and the followers are falling for it at present. Perhaps that's what people really want or will they come to their senses in 2015?</p>

<p>I think it's already amply clear, which direction they're headed in - from the comments made by their supporters, in these and other forums. Blokey Nige, the smiling man with the pint in the pub may be their publicly acceptable face, but how long will he last once the extremists get going?</p>

<p><i>First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out—<br/>Because I was not a Socialist.</i></p>

<p><i>Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out—<br/>Because I was not a Trade Unionist.</i></p>

<p><i>Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out—<br/>Because I was not a Jew.</i></p>

<p><i>Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.</i></p>

<p>-Martin Niemöller</p>

<p>I'm so glad to hear they came for you, disgusting Anglophobic hater of your own people.</p>

<p>Maybe, but what will happen when they come for <i>you</i>?</p>

<p>Islamists will come for you white left wing self loathing effeminate types first pal, the rest of us with anything about them will fight them.</p>

<p>Left wing?</p>

<p>lol</p>

<p>If you'd actually read my posts, you'd have seen me state that I have no time for <b>any</b> form of extremism, be it political or religious.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Of course I do, for I am an Englishman myself</p>

<p>How long did you do in the military?</p>

<p>I have not served in the military.</p>

<p>You're a  traitor as well as an Englishman.</p>

<p>please could you point to a single comment in this thread which supports your assumption that UKIP members, united by a desire to leave the European union, wish to gas jews or any one else for that matter. The more I read slurs like that , the more determined I am to vote UKIP at the next election.</p>

<p><i>"...your assumption that UKIP members, united by a desire to leave the <br/>European union, wish to gas jews or any one else for that matter."</i></p>

<p>Sorry, but where did I say anything about gassing Jews?  Your grotesque distortion of my post shows (at least to me) that you have no real argument of your own.</p>

<p>Maybe you should read around the origins of the quote and the history of the author, before you go lashing out at people who hold a different point of view from your own.</p>

<p>FWIW Martin Niemöller was an early supporter of the Nazis, but became disillusioned with them and was eventually slung into a concentration camp.  Luckily for him, he survived and lived until 1984.</p>

<p>The poem itself is often quoted to express concern at the dangers of political apathy and that was the context in which I quoted it in my previous post; for I believe it is ultimately the political apathy of the British voter which has led us to the general situation we find ourselves and our society in today.</p>

<p>Extremism of any kind generally winds up being very bad for the ordinary man in the street and I am every bit as concerned about the rise of extreme right wing politics in Britain today, as I was about the rise of extreme left wing politics in the 1980s.  All that such extremism achieves, is to turn an already divided public even further against each other, thus making them easier to rule by political shysters and manipulators.</p>

<p>The idea that repatriating foreigners will solve all the nation's ills is naively simplistic and dangerously so.  Will it persuade English born-and-bred layabouts who have chosen a life on benefits as a career, to get off their backsides and contribute to society?  I don't think so, somehow.</p>

<p>Now before you go flying off the handle again, please take a few minutes to educate yourself with the following links...</p>

<p>Happy reading!</p>

<p>Pompous Ass ! I already knew who Niemoller was. I was already familiar with the quote. By quoting him in the context of this debate you are deliberately drawing a parallel between UKIP and the Nazis. Much as the Climate Hysterics call rational people climate change 'Deniers'. Instead of engaging in argument just sling historical insults.</p>

<p>What is it about so many UKIP supporters, that makes it impossible for them to respond to the concerns of their critics, without resorting to insults, if not actual abuse?</p>

<p>The Jock indie supporters resorted to insults - they got quite good at it. Look what happened to them! Fear not - right will be on our side at the end of the day and blokey Nige will be but a discarded waste of space - just like Russell Brand.</p>

<p>Indeed.  That's why I never flag their posts, no matter how offensive they are.  That way their hate remains on display, for all fair-minded people to see.</p>

<p>Ridiculous slurs like that are all they have left. No credibility.</p>

<p>You don't just give them "a bit longer" , you actively engage in debate with them to let them show themselves up. Which is something that didn't happen with the BNP until BBC's Question Time finally allowed Nick Griffin to appear, only for Jack Straw to make the bigger tit of himself. Politicians eh.</p>

<p>They ? u mean the Black , Asian and White people that voted for UKIP Im gay with a multiracial family ... Most of us vote UKIP; people like you just don't get it. A lot of people want immigration controls; for the sake of our services and infrastructure ....</p>

<p>It is not UKIP policy to repatriate EU migrants</p>

<p>It is not UKIP policy to repatriate some of those who are here from other continents</p>

<p>It is however the policy that millions of perfectly sane, perfectly reasonable Englishmen would applaud</p>

<p>Nobody asked us if we should open our doors to mass immigration</p>

<p>We have the right to take careful note of the results of mass immigration , and come to the obvious conclusion , that it has been catastrophic</p>

<p>Agreed!</p>

<p>Not 'would', ok, we DO applaud. Millions of us around the countery are going to vote UKIP in May 2015. We DO applaud sensible immigration under the control of a British government.</p>

<p>....''officially'', it is not.</p>

<p>You have, liker all LAB-TOR extremist Anglophobes, a paranoid view of the world.</p>

<p>And yet isn't it UKIP which publishes never-ending whining, whingeing and moaning about slurs and smears apparently being spread about UKIP?</p>

<p>Irony?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>I tried very hard</p>

<p>All governments have sent home workers whose permits have ended. I know 2 Australian girls who couldn't get their work permits renewed and who received letters telling them to leave the country, which they have done.</p>

<p>Nick Clegg seen in Brussels house hunting for his new job working for the EU next May.</p>

<p>I was in Brussels a couple of weeks ago. It was full of riot police firing tear gas and protesters burning cars.  I hope Nick Clegg ends up somewhere near the Midi station where it was all kicking off.</p>

<p>Crybaby Clegg is curiously silent on his miserable result in Rochester and Strood. Perhaps contemplating Hari-Kiri ?</p>

<p>You know what, that is exactly right. We didn't hear anything from him yesterday before the by election, and he has continued his high valued silence today.<br/>Long may it continue like this.</p>

<p>David Cameron said he was determined to win the seat back at the next election. I'm sure he said he was determined to win the seat at THIS election.</p>

<p>Throw everything at UKIP he said. A GE is different but Reckless has been the sitting MP for a few years in Rochester.</p>

<p>Can somebody tell me what UKIP will do (if anything) to address the issue of zero hours contracts - a form of bonded serfdom, popular around the Middle Ages, which has been the source of huge 'downward pressure' on wages in more recent times?</p>

<p>What (if anything) will UKIP do, to ensure that all British workers are paid a living wage; rather than the bare minimum required by law?</p>

<p>Hello Mr Yammerhant. In reply to your very reasonable enquiry, I have asked my local UKIP branch for the information you request and will respond to you when I have it. In the meantime I recommend MR Owbis' response to you below.</p>

<p>What  [if anything]  did Labour do during 13 years of government? What [if anything] has the coalition done in 4 1/2 years? Asking what UKIP would do is simply asking a hypothetical question while simultaneously absolving the guilty parties.</p>

<p>No.  It's a question to which I'm seeking an answer.</p>

<p>If you don't have one, just say so.</p>

<p>Initially UKIP would raise the tax threshold to £13,000 so that those on minimum wage wouldn't pay tax.  When Labour brought in the minimum wage little did we know that almost everyone would end up on it.  I thought it was to stop unscrupulous employers from taking advantage of those with learning difficulties. Never been  so wrong in my life.  Wages have flat-lined so the UK's like a communist country where no matter where people work they get paid the same.  With no competition in the wage market companies are making a outrageous fortunes whilst work conditions and the standard of living amongst the majority is going down, down, down.  Zero hours contracts would be made illegal under UKIP. <br/>Labour just want to make them 'fairer'....we know what that means in their doublespeak.<br/>Obviously whilst there's uncontrolled immigration wages will continue to be further compressed.</p>

<p><i>"Zero hours contracts would be made illegal under UKIP"</i></p>

<p>And you know that for a fact, do you?</p>

<p>Gotta link to any official UKIP policy statements to that effect?  Is it a part of their manifesto??</p>

<p>Because if it's not a part of their manifesto, it's just more words from politicians - and we know how trustworthy <i>they</i> are, don't we, boys and girls? ;-)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/471010/We-ll-tackle-scandalous-zero-hour-contracts-says-Farage-in-pitch-for-working-class-vote" rel="nofollow">http://www.express.co.uk/news/...</a><br/>If you read the article above I think you'll agree that from the tone Mr Farage is taking, it's evident he understands very well the devastating effect these contracts have on people's lives.  Whereas the other parties make out they're a good thing - for the holy grail that is the economy - so we've all got to put up and shut up about it.</p>

<p>So what's Nige actually going to <b>do</b> about it, once he gets all this power he's seeking?</p>

<p>Actions speak louder than words.</p>

<p>You're asking a person on a thread, a punter just like me and you, to underwrite the official policy of a political party?<br/>All you have to do is go to <a href="http://www.ukip.org" rel="nofollow">www.ukip.org</a> to get the official s.p.<br/>But then my guess is that you just want an argument.</p>

<p>I'm just asking, because there are a number of UKIP supporters in here who seem more than prepared to tell us  that UKIP is going to do this, that and the other, as though it was official party policy - just as you did with your assertion that they will make zero hours contracts illegal.</p>

<p>If you're so well versed in what UKIP are going to do, then why not simply back it up with a source, rather than getting all defensive and snarky when you're called out on it?</p>

<p>Alternatively you can admit that you were just making it up and that - while banning zero hours contracts is  something you would like to see UKIP do - you don't actually have a clue whether they will or not.  At least then I'd admire your honesty.</p>

<p>Excuse me it was I who said UKIP would make zero hours contract illegal.  However on enquiry they have not published their manifesto yet so  I do apologise for jumping the gun there.  As you probably know apart from the fact people have no job security with those pernicious contracts, they enable the employer to have people working full time while having none of the employment laws in place to protect their interests.  Please go to:<br/><a href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/" rel="nofollow">http://www.express.co.uk/news/</a>...<br/>for Mr Farage's view on zero hour contracts.</p>

<p>The NHS is already being privatised under Labour and Conservative.  I'm a medical secretary but I don't type the letters anymore.  I have to send them over to India via computer every day and they're typed up in India.  When they come back I have to correct them.  The process takes longer than it does to type them myself.  So the NHS is paying twice for the same letters. The Indian entrepreneurs who set this system up are well on their way to becoming millionaires, with their hands firmly in the pot of tax-payers money, the pot they know has no bottom. (fair play they've done nothing wrong, everyone's  got to make a shekel,). What Lab/Con spend on the NHS goes straight into this type of venture and into the bank accounts of the massive middle management they've created, who do nothing but cynically dismantle the NHS from the comfort of their expensively carpeted offices whilst taking home a salary upwards of £80,000.  None of it goes in nurses purses or on wards or anything that might benefit a patient.  It's all rigged to benefit global big business.  This is how it is now.  Patients have become an inconvenience in hospitals where big business is the priority.<br/>UKIP honestly say they would spend less on the NHS but the money would go where it's needed on nurses and wards.  UKIP will wipe out middle management and get the matrons back running the hospitals. Matrons cost a fraction of the cost of managers and as everybody knows, they run a tight ship.  Instead of contracting out the nursing, cleaning and cooking, with the agencies taking the lions share of the money and paying staff peanuts, staff who would be employed by the NHS with all employment law protecting them, holiday pay and sick pay, pensions and the rest.   That's right, just like it used to be.  Every man and his dog knows you get good quality service by allowing staff to earn a good living with job security.<br/>We need to get these traitors out of Westminster ASAP,<br/>They seem determined to destroy every aspect of our lives.</p>

<p>I beg your pardon, but doesn't that go against Mr. Farage's declared preference for a Health Service run by private companies?</p>

<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>The NHS is already being privatised under Labour and Conservative.  I'm a medical secretary but I don't type the letters anymore.  I have to send them over to India every morning so that Indian men/women can do them for 50 rupees a day.   When they come back I have to correct them, this takes longer than it does to write them.  So they're paying me and paying the Indian entrepreneurs for the same letters. The Indian entrepreneurs are making millions out of Labour and Conservatives spend on the NHS goes straight into this type of venture and into the bank accounts of the massive middle management they've created, who do nothing but cynically dismantle the NHS from the comfort of their expensively carpeted offices whilst taking home a salary upwards of £80,000.  None of it goes to nurses or wards or anything that might benefit the patient or the clinical staff.  It's all rigged to benefit global big business.  This is how it is now.  UKIP would spend less but get the matrons back running the hospitals, doctors and patients want this.  Nothing went amiss when there were matrons.  Instead of contracting out the nursing, cleaning and cooking, the staff who would be employed by the NHS with all associated benefits like holiday pay, not some private company who are pocketing most of the cash, providing no job security, paying peanuts, and by so doing delivering a sub-standard service.   No wonder the NHS is in such a state.  If we don't get these muppetts  out it will get worse.t of the British tax payer for old rope.  The money</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure it's part of UKIP's manifesto.  Please bear with me and I'll get back to you on it.</p>

<p>OK - thanks very much.  I appreciate the honesty of your reply and look forward to hearing more - whatever the outcome of your search.</p>

<p>It's just that Mr. Farage - being an ex-City boy and product of the Thatcher years - doesn't really strike me as one to stand up against the excesses of big business; particularly in view of his stated preference for a privately-run healthcare system, over the NHS.</p>

<p>Excuse me it was I who said UKIP would make zero hours contract illegal.

<p>Still no evidence to back up your claim that UKIP will declare zero hours contracts illegal, then?</p>

<p>Oh.</p>

<p>Yes disappointing but do read Mr Farage's opinion of them in the link I gave you.</p>

<p>I think we have to be careful here, Mr Yammerhant, because we cannot of course trust anyone, Nigel Farage included, to be honest, fair and reasonable, unless we have the power to remove them from office at constituency level - this is written UKIP policy. It means the local electorate could remove a sitting Prime Minister from office in their constituency if enough people activate that power. Humans lie all the time. However, as a LAB-TOR supporter you will no doubt be familiar with their policies for Zero hours. I am not, so could you kindly tell us what they are? What is it that makes you more suspicious of UKIP than LABTOR?</p>

<p>Don't bother, Milford.  It's a straw man.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Restrict unskilled immigration.</p>

<p>Or create more jobs.</p>

<p>How?   A politician can't create jobs.  He might create the economic climate in which others can create jobs.  They are different things and if it was as  easy as you imply everyone would be doing it already.<br/>No, the first step in creating better employment opportunities is to reduce the size of the labour pool.  Simple supply and demand.</p>

<p>Is that their official policy?  Wouldn't it be better to legislate against the practice??</p>

<p>Or maybe the Great British Public could apply pressure to the companies who use them, by boycotting them.</p>

<p>There's a list at: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-hour_contract#Employers_in_the_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z...</a></p>

<p>UKIP's one size fits all policy answer to everything : be mean to foreigners.</p>

<p>LAB-TOR policy excludes all foreigners not in the EU. We are currently refusing, on a mass scale, entry to the UK from Indians, Chinese, Malaysians etc becasue of racist LABTOR policy. You are apparently ignorant of this fact, Mr Phrasing.</p>

<p>You sound like you're about 12 years old</p>

<p>You are being far too generous.</p>

<p>The Tories will win this seat back again at the next General Election.</p>

<p>The liquid-lunch down the boozer policies of UKIP are as likely to stand up to scrutiny in the run up to the General Election as Alex Salmond's currency plans for an independent Scotland.</p>

<p>Will they throw the kitchen sink at it?</p>

<p>One of the problems with UKIP is that they are a party of protest, not Government.</p>

<p>As the General Election nears and they are pressed with hard questions, such as what will happen to British jobs when the extra costs of trading with Europe outside of the Single Market are heaped on top of UK businesses, they will fade as the LibDems have at previous General Elections.</p>

<p>The Kippers should enjoy their success for now, but great by-election victories as usually reversed at the next General Election.</p>

<p>Yes keep telling yourself that.  You can fool some of the people........</p>

<p>UKIP the posh form of the BNP don't you think?</p>

<p>Not at all, that's what the MSM say to put people off.  Go to You Tube and watch a conference. Anyone with any links to BNP is not allowed into UKIP like they are into all the other parties.</p>

<p>What are those costs?  Verifiable facts please.</p>

<p>Extra regulations, paperwork and import tariffs.</p>

<p>What extra paperwork and import tariffs?  Are you seriously suggesting the EU would want to stop trading with Britain or want to enter a trade war? Why would the EU want to stop selling us their products?<br/>If you think about it for even a few seconds the idea of trade restrictions makes no sense for the EU.  It's a myth being peddled by people who can't make a positive argument in favour of membership.</p>

<p>"What extra paperwork and import tariffs?"</p>

<p>Good luck trying to trade with Europe from outside the EU :-(</p>

<p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/trade/import-and-export-rules/import-into-eu/" rel="nofollow">http://ec.europa.eu/trade/impo...</a></p>

<p>"Are you seriously suggesting the EU would want to stop trading with Britain or want to enter a trade war?"</p>

<p>Don't be ridiculous. Trading with the Europe outside of the EU will be more expensive which will cost British jobs.</p>

<p>Access to the Single Market is the positive argument in favour of British membership of the EU that trumps everything else.</p>

<p>What is most important  is that we rule ourselves, we fought two world wars to avoid being ruled by a German dominated Europe now they want to sign up for it. Then we have the European arrest warrant, which means a British citizen can be extradited to any EU  country  without having the opportunity to challenge it in a British court. It is not on.</p>

<p>You still haven't explained what extra paperwork would be required.</p>

<p>Which British workers are going to lose their jobs, and why?</p>

<p>"Trading with the Europe outside of the EU will be more expensive which will cost British jobs."<br/>You are making a circular argument so I'll ask again.  What costs, exactly?  Why?</p>

<p>They can't answer direct questions - they just keep parroting the programmed jargon.  It's pathetic.</p>

<p>What extra paperwork do you refer to?</p>

<p>I thought UKIP was supposed to represent the interests of <b>British</b> people, living in the <b>United Kingdom</b> - hence the <b>UK</b> in their name.</p>

<p>So what's the obsession with <b>English</b> people, on the part of so many of their supporters?  There's more to the UK than England, you know.</p>

<p>Or maybe you don't.</p>

<p>Perhaps it demonstrates tp you that the English part of teh Uk is not at all demonstrated in Parliament by the current "elite".</p>

<p>SingingNun's comment below is spot on.</p>

<p>The majority of British MPs represent English constituencies.  If you didn't like the selections the main parties were making, then you could have all signed up as members, attended local party meetings and worked together; to ensure that someone whom you felt better represented your interests was selected instead.</p>

<p>How come you didn't do that?  How come you - the voting public - allowed things get so bad??</p>

<p>The by election was taking place in a constituency in England.<br/>The shadow attorney general got caught publicly demonstrating Labour's contempt for the English.  (She's been sacked for revealing her view not because anyone in Labour sees it as wrong.)<br/>Hence, lot's of discussion about England.</p>

<p>Aren't the English allowed an identity then?</p>

<p>Did I say that?</p>

<p>Don't be daft - the cross of St George is sneered at by the elite.</p>

<p>Chubby chops is on the news, lesson learned? Not a bit of it, still the same old negative Dave....reason, well the truth is the success of his government is so great they've nothing positive to tell us so they brief negatively about UKIP.....frightened? You bet he is.</p>

<p>""In a debate on the NHS in the Commons, Mr Skinner said that he had had a "United Nations heart bypass" carried out by a Syrian cardiologist, a Malaysian surgeon, a Dutch doctor and a Nigerian registrar.""</p>

<p>So it's morally ok to deprive Syria, Malaysia and Nigeria of health care professionals?</p>

<p>We are drawing the very people these developing countries desperately need and then making them aid dependent.</p>

<p>Madness Mr Skinner.</p>

<p>When I had a heart attack last year, my life was saved by a man wearing a turban.</p>

<p>Did he have a defibrillator in his turban?</p>

<p>I'm not sure.  I was unconscious by that stage.</p>

<p>You are assuming that doctors who work and train in the UK never take their skills back to teaching hospitals in Syria, Malaysia and Nigeria.</p>

<p>They pay enough for their training, why does it matter what country they choose to practice in? Surely that should be their decision (provided there are vacancies in the UK that can't be filled by competent British candidates of course)</p>

<p>It is they of pro immigration who argue the positive, if nefariously of the immigrants in the NHS...if their argument is true, then SMB's observation stands.</p>

<p>You appear to assume that the doctors trained in the UK.  More likely that they have been recruited to come here post-qualification.</p>

<p>There are only a handful of countries in the world that have teaching hospitals that can match the quality found inside the British NHS.<br/></p>

<p>Those hospitals charge foreigners for their training, you do realise that don't you?</p>

<p>Yes, and due to the increase in demand on the NHS, we are now forced to recruit doctors from countries whose standards are not comparable to our own.  So again, I assert that you cannot assume that doctors from Syria, Nigeria and Malaysia were trained in the UK.</p>

<p>We can only assume Germany is not one of them</p>

<p>Good point!</p>

<p>I'm assuming the majority do not, yes - Anecdotal evidence perhaps - prove me wrong.</p>

<p>Dear uninspiring and defunct political parties who pompously think they still dominate UK politics,</p>

<p>An unembellished UKIP manifesto respectfully offers British voters a legitimate chance to credibly reduce their rising frustration from menacing EU oppression of the now fading British way of life.</p>

<p>So while you smug “big three” usual political suspects were busy giving away our British sovereignty, our tax money, and our national identity to stoke backbiting about any mundane virtues of UKIP … we voted for them!</p>

<p>UKIP is part of a forthright solution ... not part of any troubling problem with contemporary politics.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>UK electorate</p>

<p>I didn't know you'd been elected to speak on behalf of the entire UK population - when did that happen?</p>

<p>Or is it just <i>ad populum</i>?</p>

<p>Perhaps more a case of … future prediction.</p>

<p>"The UKIP Few"</p>

<p>"The gratitude of every home in our island, in our sovereign country, and indeed ex-pats throughout the world, except in the abodes of the guilty, goes out to the British voters who, undaunted by odds, unwearied in their constant challenge and media biased spin danger, are turning the tide of the election war by their prowess and by their devotion. Never in the field of UK political conflict was so much owed by so many to so few. "</p>

<p>And who are these 'guilty', of whom you speak?</p>

<p>How does British business trade with Europe after we leave the Single Market and our exporters have to pay import duties and complete lots of extra paperwork? How many British jobs would UKIP in government cost us?</p>

<p>Are you as thick as you project via your comments or is it just a ploy and you're just another EU troll? <br/>On reflection being thick and being an EU troll are not mutually exclusive so perhaps you are both.</p>

<p>The man asked a question and you respond with insults.</p>

<p>That tells us a lot.</p>

<p>Keep digging.</p>

<p>What does it tell you?<br/>Are you also intending to vote Labour next May along with phasing?</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p>Are you interested in actual reasonable answers to those questions, or are you just lashing out? If the former, I'm happy to make some suggestions, if the latter, then it would be pointless.</p>

<p>EEC was for trade … full stop!</p>

<p>Right … was UK involvement with EEC for trade. A fair and fitting mandate made with consent of the voting public.</p>

<p>Wrong … is ramrod political mutations of government policy ceding British freewill to encroaching EU supremacy without a public vote.</p>

<p>Soon under EU mandates and tax burden there will be no British way of life, we simply don’t need EU in full or half measure to dominate or interfere with British liberty.</p>

<p>Elected UK government promised to hold an unimpeded EU referendum for UK voters, yet Tory leader continues to show contempt toward electorate by blatantly evading and  stubbornly stalling on delivering a straightforward “in or out” free vote on EU in a timely and unfettered manner.</p>

<p>Imposed timelines, caveats and conditions serve only to create an elusive and untenable “EU referendum” pretense.</p>

<p>I'd like to hear your suggestions.  Don't be shy.</p>

<p>See my answer to "phrasing" (above, or below, depending on your settings).</p>

<p>The EU isn't stupid. (It's expensive, self-serving and corrupt - but not stupid). They'll continue to trade with the UK, there won't be any significant extra costs, just like there aren't now when the UK and US trade. And if they DO turn out to be stupid and try to shut the doors? We'll just trade with the rest of the world without the shackles of EU restrictions binding us.</p>

<p>Pretty simple, really.</p>

<p>Maybe a little too simple.  IIRC it takes around seven years to negotiate a trade agreement - <i>i.e.</i> beyond the lifetime of the next Parliament.</p>

<p>How ready would the likes of Australia, New Zealand and our other, former trading partners be to do business with us, having been kicked in the teeth by us 40 years ago, when we first signed up to the Common Market.  Could we be relied upon as a long term (<i>i.e.</i> decades, if not centuries) trading partner, or would we just drop them again, the moment a better offer came along.</p>

<p>Yes, we do business with the US, but there are many American companies (and I should know, because I've tried to deal with them) who simply aren't interested in the UK market because it's too small by itself for them to be bothered with.</p>

<p>Apart from that, it simply costs more to transport all those goods halfway around the world, than it does to source them from just over the channel.</p>

<p>The EU might be talking tough, but I reckon they are quietly bricking it at the prospect of a British departure.  We're not the only ones with an increasingly popular anti-EU party.  Alternative for Gemany is doing quite well, too and even started trading in gold bullion recently, in order to raise funds.  A British exit from the EU would provide a spur to them and others, not least the National Front in France, the Danish People's Party and Jobbik in Hungary.</p>

<p>Maybe if you UKIP lickers looked a little further than your own back yards, then you'd see a slightly bigger picture and realise that the European Parliament is home to several anti-EU MEPs, regrettably mostly from the Far Right.  Germany (sadly) even returned a Neo-Nazi MEP in the last European elections =(</p>

<p>You make some good points. Apoligies, at nearly2am, it's too late in the evening to do them justice.</p>

<p>I'll pick up on a couple of things: Re the Americans, it's far easier to sell to them, than it is to persuade them to sell to us. This I know, having tried myself to engage a couple of US companies with a view to becoming a UK distributor. I'll keep trying - but in the meanwhile, my company's product is currently "whupping ass" (I think that's what they call it) over there, we're struggling to keep up with demand. Thank goodness it's a (largely) software product, if it were engineering, I'd be struggling to get the staff... as it is, we still have to source and move on some hardware. Amazing how much has to be shipped to us from China or the US, where we assemble it &amp; send it back to them... I think they call that "value add". Price wise, it doesn't cost silly amounts more to send to the US, as it does to Poland or France for example. The really incredible bit is TNT can get the h/w from our door at 3pm, to anywhere in the continental USA by 5pm local time.</p>

<p>You're right that the EU must be worrying as much about us quitting, as some of our people are worrying about it. 40 years is a hell of a long time to most people - half a lifetime even for an octogenarian... and if it does happen, then yes - I think the EU as we know it will crumble before our very eyes. Hopefully it will be replaced with something better - free(ish) movement of EU citizens, free(ish) trade. Or maybe it'll disintegrate into war again, although I suspect most EU countries, on their own, are now too weak to wage a war by themselves.</p>

<p>Finally - I'm no UKIP "licker". I have a lot of sympathy for their goals and their views (I share many myself), but ultimately they're still not the party for me. If the UK Libertarian party hadn't spectacularly imploded before it even managed to get going, I suspect that's where my loyalties would lie. I hate "big government", and "big state" - it's all too "big brother", and somehow only the political elite do well out of it - rather like the USSR in the bad old days.</p>

<p>"I'm happy to make some suggestions,"</p>

<p>Please go ahead. What happens to British jobs when the extra costs of trading with Europe outside of the Single Market are heaped on top of UK businesses?</p>

<p>Firstly, it's not in Europe's interest to make it uneconomic to import goods from the UK. We keep hearing how our major export market is Europe - that means they need us, and they need our products. So they'll continue to allow them to be imported. A free trade agreement would cement this. Such an agreement is already on the table.</p>

<p>Secondly; what extra paperwork? Most import/export worldwide requires only a few commercial invoices and maybe some kind of proof that a product isn't available locally which meets the same purpose (the USA have that one). 6 extra pieces of paper accompany my company's product to the USA, South America, Australia, China, various Middle Eastern companies, that's the only difference. That and never send anything to Brazil, because their customs will simply steal it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, quitting the EU and negotiating a sensible free trade agreement would reduce the red tape and other costs associated with the EU and EU legislation.</p>

<p>Look at it this way: We traded with Europe for thousands of years (and fought them off a few times as well), all the way until the 1970s when the fledgling EU was born (ironically, as a free trade area, rather like the one I'd propose to replace the EU with). 40 years of laws and trade rules, vs. thousands of years of history, yeah I think we'll manage OK.</p>

<p>Here here. But I'm afraid you're wasting your time with phrasing. I suspect he/she was swayed by the argument 'let's give up control of our currency, It will be great. We won't have to pay commission on our holiday money'. Fine grasp of economics.</p>

<p>Oh sure, the EU is going to enter a trade war with us. They have no interest in selling us their mercedes or their wine. Have you looked at our balance of trade with europe ? They are currently pushing themselves into a deflationary spiral. It is only our consumption that can keep them afloat.</p>

<p>Please do not dodge the question.</p>

<p>What happens to British jobs when the extra costs of trading with Europe outside of the Single Market are heaped on top of UK businesses?</p>

<p>You probably didn't do very well at comprehension at school did you. There will be no extra costs. The EU will not be entering a trade war with us. They cannot afford to. This is a Lib Dem lie. In the meantime there is a huge world of burgeoning economies who will be happy to trade with us under the GAT agreement. Is China in the EU ? India ? Brazil ? the US. Wow how there economies must suffer from not being in the club.</p>

<p>I am voting Labour next May.</p>

<p>UKIP have nothing to offer except xenonphobia and a strange mix of half-baked policies based on Thatcherism and protectionism, the Bullingdon Boys who are the current inhabitants of Downing Street have had their chance and gotten the country nowhere, the Libdems sold their souls to enter coalition with the Tories, and the Greens want us all to return to bucolic pre-industrial society that never was.</p>

<p>So although Ed is not a great choice, he is the best of a bad lot.</p>

<p>Vote Labour.</p>

<p>Any credibility you were hoping to generate by your efforts on here were destroyed with the first sentence of this effort.</p>

<p>You really, REALLY want this man to be your prime minister? Your representative at the top level of the world? The man who sits at G20 summits, and makes policy that affects the world?</p>

<p>A man like this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlTggc0uBA8" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>"REALLY want this man to be your prime minister?"</p>

<p>Where did I say that Ed was a great choice? Ed is the best choice available.</p>

<p>You said "he is the best of a bad lot."</p>

<p>There are 4 or 5 main party leaders to chose from. They can't all be worse than Ed.</p>

<p>Out of a choice between liquid-lunch Farage, the Bulington Boy and Cleggie, Ed is the winner.</p>

<p>Although it would be better to have a John Smith or a pre-Iraq War Tony Blair to vote for.</p>

<p>Blimey, if you say so. Just don't let him have a bacon sandwich, or a greggs pasty.</p>

<p>What does Labour offer voters in Rotherham?<br/>Emily Thornberry showed the contempt the Labour elite feel towards WVM and those who dare to express overt patriotism.<br/>Ken Livingstone shows how Labour support the corrupt cesspit of Tower Hamlets.<br/>Seriously, no-one with a shred of sense could consider voting for the party who sent 'search parties' across the world to dilute the ethnic majority of our country.</p>

<p>"voting for the party who sent 'search parties' across the world to dilute the ethnic majority of our country."</p>

<p>I have no interest in hate politics.</p>

<p>Why are historical facts 'hate politics'?<br/>Labour admitted that was their aim when they invited mass immigration.  It is a matter of Labour Party record.<br/>Once again, I ask you if the political decisions made by the Labour Party in Rotherham were really in the best interests of the people?  Seriously, would you campaign for your party in that town?</p>

<p>Thornberry may have shown her (and all too many of the ruling elite's) real feelings about us normal people, but honestly I haven't heard this much of an outpouring of sympathy towards White Van Man since..... erm, well, since ever actually...</p>

<p>WVM - rejoice in your new found status of respectable hard-working English men and women. I'm sure it'll only last until the Monday rush hour...</p>

<p>" No easy answers " says Mr Cameron.<br/>Well here's one David - if you give a damn about the survival of the Tory party ( and I don't anymore ) then take the lead in getting us out of the disaster that is the EU.<br/>That's the only answer you need.</p>

<p>I think Gove has lost his mind. He just spoke on Radio 4 news and described Cameron as " the greatest politician of the age". I guess he may be the only one who thinks so!</p>

<p>He may be right, the competition isn't very strong and Cameron is an OK politician.  Bear in mind that for most of us being called a good politician would be considered a grave insult.<br/>It's a shame he's such a lousy MP and PM.</p>

<p>"the greatest politician of the age"</p>

<p>The Stone Age?</p>

<p>I agree with Gove. Cameron knows more about the science of politics than Nige (with a soft'g' who wears Tie Rack ties and Arfur Daley coats)Ed and the other bloke can ever dream of. So he(Gove) is not the only one who thinks so and it is somewhat presumptuous of you to say otherwise my friend!</p>

<p>So you grade politicians on their sartorial elegance? Good grief.</p>

<p>Nige ain't a pukka politician - he tries hard I'll give him that as he does in his sense of dress which is odd.  If you wish to be an elected leader of some sort then looking  a dead ringer for Arfur Daley is not a good idea. You should not be afraid of donning a scruffy, well worn mac or even a donkey jacket if you wish to appeal to people who actually work for a living, drink lager and go to pubs. Know wadda mean squire?</p>

<p>Well, at least he wears a tie!  Which is something the scruffy rest should do, and not crumple up the collar of their open-necked shirts under a jacket. It may be meant to look "democratic" but it actually makes them look as if they don't give a d***.</p>

<p>Good grief. Is that you Dave?</p>

<p>They call this democracy. Turnout 50.67% Total votes cast 40,113 of which the Kipper got 16,867 = 42%. However 42% of 50.67% = 21%. So 21% of the eligible electorate<br/>voted for this numpty while a sensible 79% wanted nothing to do with him.<br/>Proving what no one admits - that our kind of democracy merely caters for the<br/>lowest common denominator. I have never witnessed this denominator lower.</p>

<p>Sadly the alternatives are not that prepossessing either.  A very<br/>sad reflection on the current state of the UK. Given the choice I would far<br/>prefer Aunty Angela to run things.</p>

<p>And yet one of the highest turnouts for a by-election.....betcha you weren't saying that about Heywood &amp; its 36% turnout or Labours 40:9% compared to the UKIP 38:7%......perchance t'was your Auntie Angela who won given your preference</p>

<p>The other 49.33% knew what the polls were saying and were not the slightest bit interested in trying to change the outcome, despite haviing the kitchen sink thrown at them. . . That's democracy loser. .</p>

<p>Or maybe 49.33% saw UKIP as just another bunch of dishonest politicians, pushing a narrow agenda, which didn't reflect their views.</p>

<p>That's the problem with our party-based poloitical system: it was born of an age, when class divisions were more clearly defined than they are today.  As such, it is an increasingly irrelevant institution for many people, which fails to reflect modern society.</p>

<p>You are really desperate aren't you. :))))))))))</p>

<p>No, not particularly.  UKIP may be having their moment now, but I don't believe it will last.  I don't believe that the majority of their new-found supporters  have the stamina for a long term campaign; they just regard UKIP as a quick fix.</p>

<p>Hey ho. . Don't bet your mortgage on them not becoming the 'King Makers'. . Everyone knows the Labour party can't be trusted with the economy, but similarly the Tories can't be trusted over the corrupt EU (that we didn't ever vote for) . Working man trusts Nigel the 'bloke' who tells it as it is. . It's only Islington 'PC lefties' that now don't now care about the state of our country.</p>

<p>“Huh”?</p>

<p>Angela Merkel if that's what you are asking.</p>

<p>Measured that way It's still a far greater percentage than voted for either Labour or Conservative at the last election or the few before that.  Given that no one, 0%, voted for the current government I'd say Reckless has a pretty legitimate mandate.</p>

<p>In reality he got 42% of the votes cast.  </p>

<p>Not the point. The point is that the majority of people eligible to vote in the UK have the attitude - A plague on all your houses.<br/>We are the unrepresented and we are the majority who are waiting for some one or some party worth voting for.<br/>In a true democracy what should happen is that no Government can be formed because the majority don't like or want what's on offer.  Unless at least 80% of the electorate vote there should be no change at all. Nor should any new laws be passed by the default incumbents.  That might concentrate minds.</p>

<p>When they look at the Pie Chart of the result, it probably makes them all want to rush to the khasi.</p>

<p>Actually, 65.5% of people voted for a coalition party in Rochester and Strood at the last General Election.</p>

<p>Last night, Mark Reckless's vote went down in both percentage and absolute terms.</p>

<p></p>

<p>What a bizzare way of looking at it.</p>

<p>65.5% of people may have voted for one of the parties that ended up forming a coalition; but since each party lost key policy proposals as part of the formation of that coalition, it is arguable that not a single person voted for it.</p>

<p>Indeed - it's an absurd coalition; the lib-dems who were, if anything, further to the left than Blair's Labour party (if not of Brown's), joining with the notionally right-wing Tories? It's no wonder Gordon wouldn't leave no. 10 - he probably couldn't believe they'd do a deal.</p>

<p>And in terms of a by-election one of the better turnouts....fact is the Tories share of the vote was 15% down on the GE whereas the UKIP vote? Well they won &amp; didn't stand at the last GE so Reckless did rather well last night.</p>

<p>The Lib/Dems, well all I can suggest is they visit their local M&amp;S store &amp; demand their money back as they're deposit is certainly lost at Rochester.</p>

<p>Hello, I was wondering where the Lib Dems had got to.  Nice to see you back. :)<br/>It's funny but I don't recall that option on my ballot paper.  Anyone else?</p>

<p>The Liberal Democrats sold out their soul when they entered into collation with David Cameron.</p>

<p>I think you make my point about the coalition.  Both parties pretty much sold out everyone who voted for them and don't forget that Clegg, given the option, would have jumped into bed with Brown first.</p>

<p>If Labour or Tories want to win back the votes the answer is very, very simple and has two really easy (for most of us) clauses:<br/>a) A referendum on Europe next year, not 2017 or sometime never.<br/>b) Stop blooming well lying to us, we know you are liars and you are not convincing at all. Convince us we can trust you.</p>

<p>Admittedly point b is impossible since Millibacon and LibDem Dave don't recognise what truth is but one lives in hope. Meanwhile I'll be voting UKIP, oh what a racist, sexist, blah blah blah am I eh?</p>

<p>"Meanwhile I'll be voting UKIP, oh what a racist, sexist, blah blah blah am I eh?"</p>

<p>Voting UKIP is misguided.</p>

<p>Scapegoating immigrants will not fix the UK's deep seated problems, and because immigration has a net overall positive gain for the economy, voting UKIP will actually make things worse.</p>

<p>A net overall positive gain? That's a lie if ever I read one. Have a look at the figures, maybe even read what IDS had to say about it. Incidentally, where does this scapegoating immigrants come in? UKIP is not anti-Europe, it isn't anti-immigration, it is anti-EU. Do try and read the facts mate.</p>

<p>"A net overall positive gain? That's a lie if ever I read one. "</p>

<p>UK gains £20bn from European migrants, UCL economists reveal</p>

<p>• Tax payments by European migrants far outweigh welfare <br/>• Arrivals are better educated than British workforce</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/05/eu-migrants-uk-gains-20bn-ucl-study" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/uk-...</a></p>

<p>As I said, go read the facts. The £20bn lie was made up from skewed figures by a Left biased study by University College and is based on outdated figures and was deliberately skewed to suit what they wanted it to look like. The reality, as IDS pointed out, is if you factor in how much it costs us (you) there is a massive deficit. Go read the facts rather than relying on The guardian which bears as much resemblance to reality as Millibacon does to a Prime Minister.<br/>[Edit] On second thoughts the Guardian makes sense if you compare it to Millibacon, at least you can read the words and don't have to try to figure out what he is saying. I lip read and I have no idea what he says.</p>

<p>Voting UKIP will achieve nothing my friend.</p>

<p>So what is your particular favourite going to do? Oh, let me guess, more of the same crap they've always peddled. Get real my friend, the world is changing and if you think it isn't then go ahead and vote Red or Blue, vote for green bloody martians if you like. Voting UKIP is a vote for change, something you obviously do not want, well tough, it's on it's way.</p>

<p>These thickos are still insulting the very electorate that has now collectively found them out and is about to sack them all. . Keep it up fellas!!! . . Roll on May.</p>

<p>I agree. What a shower!</p>

<p>One can only mis-quote Captain Aubrey in "Master and Commander":</p>

<p>"One must always chose the least of several weevils"</p>

<p>So they're at it in The Commons already.  From Labour's Dennis Skinner</p>

<p>"These two people here talk about sending them back from whence they came. If they did that in the hospitals in London, half of London would be dead in six months. That's the facts about Ukip," he said, to raucous cheers from the Labour benches.</p>

<p>They lie about the policies of UKIP and hope that the more they lie, that the lie will be accepted as truth.  We have to get rid of these disgraceful MPs once and for all.</p>

<p>The more bile they spew the more votes they lose. I hope they continue to lie about me, call me a racist, call me a bigot, call me anti-everything, bring it on. At their own peril I may add. For every insult and lie they lose and we, the real people, gain.</p>

<p>Dear Dennis, we import doctors because our own education system is unable to produce sufficient Britons to train as doctors.  Would you like to comment on that?</p>

<p>My comment below.</p>

<p>Dennis Skinner said "These two people here talk about sending them back from whence they came. If they did that in the hospitals in London, half of London would be dead in six months. That's the facts about Ukip," he said, to raucous cheers from the Labour benches. So, he is saying it’s ok for people to die in the countries where these doctors, nurses and health workers come from because they are here caring for us and not where they are needed in their own countries..</p>

<p>Well said, I'd just got back here and hadn't scrolled down yet.</p>

<p>Yes but a bit of context ... I mean Dennis Skinner ... about as relevant as Kenneth Clarke.</p>

<p>I agree Blodnok but unfortunately they are still around</p>

<p>Get real peeps, Nige (with a soft 'g' who wears "Tie Rack" ties) the spiv is not even an MP so he won't be Prime Minister just yet and the chances of him and his "here today and gone tomorrow' pile of retreads and nobodies being in government in May next year are less than zero. If you want a vote on whether we are to stay in the EU then the UKIP ain't gonna help. Geddit, or have I missed something? The UKIP will solve nothing.</p>

<p>Dennis Skinner ..... I mean FFS ... I thought he was dead.</p>

<p>Poor Dennis, well not in terms of salary or pension, but the fact he'll win the Bolsover seat &amp; be nearing 90 as the 2020 GE comes around.....once they get their feet under the table the only way you can get rid is the hope the table was purchased from the MFI 2nd's sale &amp; collapses around them.</p>

<p>Where's the "Long term party of government," today?  I've not heard anything from them.</p>

<p>This comment on the significance of the by election from Survation.<br/>'The winning margin, 7.3% or 2,920 votes, is less than some commentators had been predicting, in part based on polling snapshots during the campaign, but to put it in context this is one of the largest swings in by-election history, with UKIP moving from 0% of the vote in 2010 to over 42% in this by-election. This despite the heaviest campaigning effort the Conservative Party has ever conducted against UKIP with no fewer than five campaigning visits from the Prime Minister in person, over 100 Conservative MPs - many making multiple visits including most cabinet ministers. '<br/>So BBC, Liblabcon and all the others trying to create a narrative that somehow UKIP failed, the Tories did better than expected or any other view that puts a gloss on the catastrophe suffered by the rotten old parties , wallow in your delusions if you want but we know better.<br/>May 7 2015, the fightback for the British people continues.</p>

<p>Dear God the Tories and Liebor really have been in politics for far to Long.It is their and only their failures which have lead to Ukip becoming so very strong.British politicians have not thought about their electorate for decades.Mrs T may have at the beginning however Herr Big Bang really shifted loads of dosh into the wrong pockets.Of course it gave the Mirage of helping the lower middle class onto the wealth ladder with worthless denationalisations and council houses but all of that has been lost.Lets start with Harold Wilson who went cap in Hand to the IMF.In those days there were 20 dm or 10 euros to the Pound now we stand at 1.30 euros.Then came useless Ted hated Heath and the sailor Brigade and all those strange trips to the channel Islands.Then there was a Brief breath of fresh air and Britain had a Little look in on the world stage again.The Falklands saved her.Then she too became a bit of a dictator and was followed by a drab bunch lead by Shirt in the knickers John Major and his corrupt bunch.Then the greatest fiasco in British politics.New Liebour and the biggest buch of toerags we have seen for many a decade.Now when Cameron started we all thought he was the one.The best in 40 years but lets face it it to has been a kick in the kneecaps for the working man.It really is the failure of the Major parties which will take Ukip into government with 100 seat majority at westminster.Lets hope they can deliver on all the promises.I hope so because the alternative of paediophile Exchange Liebour and the trashy lieberal dems cons really isnt worth thinking about.As a final Point i must say to britain never trust labour again.They are just as bad as the Blair Brown Mandel son Crew.What do all politicians have in common they simply love to grab your Money and fill their pockets ! The first Thing nigel must do when he enters number 10 is to clarify the Situation on the pervert paediophiles and the Elm road guesthouse.This should be a national enquiry.root thze corruption out at the centre of power !!!</p>

<p>UKIP  won last night but with a majority of under 3,000 and on only a 51% turnout, past performance of by-election candidates tells us Mark Reckless will not hold the seat in the General Election. This is what happened to the SDP, it has happened many times to the SNP and other small parties. Once the turnout returns to normal and once we are faced with the screaming possibility of an Ed Miliband, Islam-loving, immigration-loving, EU-loving, union-loving, economy-wrecking Labour government, it will take fewer than 1,500 to switch or a small number of stay-at-homes to come out, to put the Tories back in Rochester and Strood.</p>

<p>Tomm, all of the concerns you lay at the door of Labour are also the policies of the Tories.<br/>With that being the truth of it, who do think is going to vote for Cameron's Tories or Labour's Miliband?<br/>The electorate have wised up and they will not be returning to either of the old failure parties which includes the LibDems.<br/>UKIP have stated their legitimate claim to the political high ground and the electorate have put them up there, there will be no going back.</p>

<p>There you go again. There are only 2 parties, bla, bla, bla. People are losing faith in the traditional parties. Fun times ahead. Take nothing for granted especially past stats.</p>

<p>"Once the turnout returns to normal".Make the call to Lynton,there's a new "normal"!</p>

<p>Sorry, but how could Nick Robinson not know who all the candidates were in R&amp;S - he is the BBC's top political commentator and this was one of the most important by-elections ever. It is his job to KNOW inside out and up and down everything and everyone.  The BF candidate is wearing a large badge saying CANDIDATE, that also shows he does not actually look at those who he thinks are merely helpers or members of the public as he is not genuinely interested in real people. </p>

<p>I expect he thought it was just another star struck fan eager to worship him.  Without a producer and a team of researchers to tell him who she was he had no chance.</p>

<p>Not only that but the candidate in question was wearing a BF fleece with a large badge on it.</p>

<p>"Boris is an asset wherever he is" - more proof that they don't get it. Boris has charisma, yes. But he is a clown and like so many others he talks but doesn't listen. He a candidate for Dave's job. That is how desperate they are.</p>

<p>I just cannot imagine Boris as a UK prime minister - especially as, according to reports, he is likely to be extradited to the USA for failing to pay taxes due as a US citizen.</p>

<p>They will come after him for those taxes as throughout his life he should have paid Capital Gains Tax to the US Treasury on all the homes he has bought and sold in the UK. That's a lot of tax on the property gains he has made in London, plus he had his constituency home in Henley.</p>

<p>Maybe the Americans should just knock the £100k they reckon he owes them off the £8,172,245 they owe us in unpaid parking fines.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/parking-fines-incurred-by-diplomatic-missions-and-international-organisations-in-the-uk--2" rel="nofollow">https://www.gov.uk/government/...</a></p>

<p>Maybe one of you enlightened (lol) Kippers can tell us what St. Nige's policy is on that little issue.</p>

<p>What's Cameron's policy on the issue?<br/>What's Miliband's policy on the issue? Actually, don't bother answering that, it'll be the opposite of whatever Cameron said.<br/>What's Calamity Clegg's policy?</p>

<p>Well the USA got Al Capone on tax evasion. (Not that Boris has to my knowledge indulged in such things as the Valentines day massacre etc)</p>

<p>Dennis Skinner said "These two people here talk about sending them back from whence they came. If they did that in the hospitals in London, half of London would be dead in six months. That's the facts about Ukip," he said, to raucous cheers from the Labour benches. So, he is saying it’s ok for people to die in the countries where these doctors, nurses and health workers come from because they are here caring for us and not where they are needed in their own countries..</p>

<p>It is hypocritical to take doctors and nurses from countries that need then, our government should be ashamed of itself. Our government should be training our own people and not just in the medical profession, why are there skill shortages in other industries because government stopped the subsidies it used to pay to companies to train people, the skill shortage in this country is a direct result of government policies.</p>

<p>But we're not taking them from other countries, they're coming to work here of their own accord.</p>

<p>The country was glued to....<br/>I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here....<br/>While Nigel was getting drunk in Kent....<br/>Political earthquake...?<br/>More like minor roadworks on the A3...<br/>The peasants are happily back at work today...<br/>Nothing changes...<br/>Tories will continue next year...<br/>The people want to led by their betters...<br/>Now move along - there's nothing to see here.....</p>

<p>Enjoy the sour grapes, better get used to them!</p>

<p>So you hope.</p>

<p>I hope this brilliant UKIP result will persuade people to vote with their conscience from now on.</p>

<p>""I don’t see what is remarkable about hard-working people driving white <br/>  vans. There’s lots of people like that in Dudley."</p>

<p>Dudley just happens to be one of the five top targets for UKIP . . .</p>

<p>Anti-English sentiment is absolutely fundamental to leftist rhetoric. Left wingers all over the world detest the English, it is almost an obligatory part of being a left winger.</p>

<p>The English traditionally have represented the epitome of white, Northern European patriotism which is everything the left detest and want to destroy.</p>

<p>The left have always defined themselves by what they are against.  The language has always been "destruction, overthrow, end or oppose."  They have never been for anything. (Except power for themselves.)  The idea that they should promote or support anything is not in the left wing lexicon.  It's a completely alien concept in socialism.</p>

<p>"They have never been for anything."</p>

<p>In defense of the left, it was a left wing Government under Clement Attlee that invented the NHS.</p>

<p>Where would we all be without the NHS?</p>

<p>Yes they did, along with the welfare state both conceptually good ideas.  But they never defined what it in terms of what it was FOR only  what it was fighting against.  Hence the unlimited growth, distortion and bloat.  I suspect today's NHS and welfare systems are very different from those originally envisioned.<br/>As for,  "where would we be?"  How can we possibly know?  Dead or wealthier, both, somewhere in between. Definitely somewhere else.</p>

<p>The English pretty much invented the Western world. Even your toilet is an English invention. Before that they used a hole in the ground. Some still do.</p>

<p>They despise the white working class of England in particular for failing to rise up and overthrow capitalism. The contempt became particularly intense after Thatcher won their votes and it continues today whatever weasel words Labour politicians use.</p>

<p>They despise the white working class for wanting the same things Tory voters want - a nice home, a job, peace and security for their family, a wonderful education for their children, a car in the drive, a summer holiday knees-up in the Canaries and a new dishwasher or tumble drier every January sales. The elite left want the workers to live in grime and poverty life-long grateful to their Marxist masters and slavishly support global Marxism in Central America or wherever while handing over their hard-pressed income tax to those who can't be bothered working or to send it abroad on a guilt trip for the self-loathing  leftie luvvies who went to public school and are burdened by their imagined stained heritage of slavery and colonialism and God knows what else that the working classes had no say in and nothing to do with, except dying in wars to save it.</p>

<p>Hating the native white English for electing Margaret Thatcher seems to be common amongst left wingers all around the world.</p>

<p>People who have absolutely nothing to do with the UK take it upon themselves to insult England for electing her.</p>

<p>The reality is Thatcher got in the way of the left enforcing their agenda in the UK and also to a large extent across Europe. They detest her and those who voted for her because she is probably the most effective leader there has been against Communism in Europe in recent decades.</p>

<p>Ofsted, just today allegedly, have criticised six Islamic schools in Tower Hamlets and are considering special measures because of the Islamic curriculum and risk of radicalisation. News about that truly only available today or was it withheld until after yesterday's election? Vote a) if you think the news was deliberately delayed b) if you think it most likely delayed or c) if you think almost certainly delayed. (If you think there are coincidences in the release of government news then please see your doctor).</p>

<p>The propaganda line being pushed by the BBC is the Tories did much better than expected and it's tryingbto create a narrative of this being a UKIP flash in the pan.<br/>With biased BBC reporting , you got the feeling the Tories had won.<br/>The commentariat and the Liblabcon oligarchy are an extreme danger to British democracy and it's response to yesterday's by election in Rochester and Strood confirm this.<br/>We're wise to your nasty little game now MSM, be prepared for UKIP to build further and expose the anti dwmocratic and anti British extremism of the people who govern Britain and their MSM little helpers</p>

<p>I've also heard them saying this isn't the political earthquake UKIP promised. Yeah, keep telling yourself that BBC, when it was target number 271!</p>

<p>We saw peak-Farage in the 2013 local elections.</p>

<p>From here on it is all difficult questions, like how do we trade with the EU after we have left the Single Market?<br/></p>

<p>The only reason why UKIP didn't make the gains in 2014 was that this year London was voting - this kept the overall vote share lower.</p>

<p>You didn't rate UKIP coming first nationally in the European elections in 2014 then.</p>

<p>"You didn't rate UKIP coming first nationally in the European elections then."</p>

<p>On a small turnout when the nature of the poll means that Europe is going to be the top issue.</p>

<p>But that's the point, it is a top issue for many Tories.<br/>Hence the rise of UKIP, and the draining of support for Cameron.</p>

<p>Ah, so in your world the election conditions of a party's success, though open to all parties only favours one party. In the case of  voting on European representation it only favours UKIP.<br/>Amazing....</p>

<p>For the majority of people, the economy, health and education are the most important voting issues, and whilst there is no seemingly no issue that UKIP cannot solve by kicking a couple of hundred thousand Poles out of the country, most people will not have Europe at the top of their list of things that need fixing at the next General Election.<br/></p>

<p>UKIP has never advocated kicking anyone out...no one, and certainly not working Poles. Stick with facts and leave the fiction to the Labour trolls.</p>

<p>The Media despise him</p>

<p>The voters idolise him</p>

<p>The LIBLABCON do not Know how to act</p>

<p>Farage is on the rise</p>

<p>He has exposed their smears and lies</p>

<p>Replacing them with common sense and facts</p>

<p>He’s attracting many voter</p>

<p>Both from LIBLABCONS and floaters</p>

<p>And has caused two Tory MPs to defect</p>

<p>The elections drawing near</p>

<p>You can smell the CONLAB fear</p>

<p>As both parties watch and wonder</p>

<p>WHOS THE NEXT?</p>

<p>Anyone seen Nick Clegg?</p>

<p>He's been on the phone to Brussels all day to try and remind them who he is so that they won't give his seat on the gravy train to someone else.</p>

<p>nick who?</p>

<p>Building barricades in Sheffield Hallam against the students.</p>

<p>Decorating the house in Valladolid. He will be moving there in six months.</p>

<p>I think I saw him trying to buy a fish licence in the Post Office? The clerk repeatedly called the guy who I think is Nick Clegg a 'loony', to which Clegg? angrily replied by making reference to famous people who kept odd pets. Clegg? remarked that he has licences for his pet dog Eric and his pet cat Eric. When the clerk said there is no such thing as a cat licence, Clegg? produced a dog licence form with the word "dog" crossed out and "cat" written in crayon, and explained that the man from the cat detector van, which comes from the "Ministry of Housinge", didn't have the right form.  Clegg? claimed he paid £60 for the cat licence, and 8 guineas for Eric the fruit bat.<br/>When the clerk assured Clegg? there is no such thing as (and no need for) a fish licence, Clegg? requested a statement to that fact jointly signed by Karl Marx and US President Barack Hussein Obama. </p>

<p>Who?</p>

<p>Booking his one way ticket to Brussels I should think , nothing here for him now .</p>

<p>probably in brussels sharing a sauna and a glass of expensive whisky with juncker and barroso.</p>

<p>Anyone seen Conor Burns MP?</p>

<p>Has he denied that he is joining UKIP again?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/10/23/ukip-conor-burns-defection_n_6034556.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.huffingtonpost.co.u...</a></p>

<p>He's out begging.<br/>Trying to scrape together his next deposit.</p>

<p>' Mark Reckless of Ukip suggested that Europeans living and working in the UK might be expelled from the UK. '</p>

<p>No he didn't.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Ed Miliband has told Sky News that Emily Thornberry's tweet displayed "disrespect <br/>  to the family" and "conveyed an idea that it was wrong or unusual <br/>  to fly the England flag."</p>

<p>Don't let Miliband/Labour fool you. Socialist are Internationalists. They look by definition down on patriotism, because their Marxist ideology dictates it.</p>

<p>I bet she wouldn't have said a word about a flag of Pakistan .</p>

<p>Reminds me, I wonder what "Baroness" Warsi thinks about our flag?<br/>IF she thinks at all, that is.</p>

<p>Possibly still scraping together the £40 thousand she stole from us in expenses . Just kidding , we will never see a penny .</p>

<p>"Right Honorables",eh?</p>

<p>I doubt Miliband has any values at all, even dodgy ones.</p>

<p>Ukip is socialist, national socialist - it is basically Labour with flags - remember that.</p>

<p>"Ukip is socialist, national socialist - it is basically Labour with flags - remember that."<br/>Intriguing.<br/>Care to elaborate?</p>

<p>I don't know what you're actually high on but it certainly ain't only heels.</p>

<p>Just being my usual accurate self.</p>

<p>You...?</p>

<p>Evidence please [as opposed to listening to your own ramblings when you're in the bath].</p>

<p>Ukip has socialist economic policies to the core - it is, essentially, a populist socialist party with a focus on the working-class in the context of the nation state rather than the international working-class...it is, therefore, national socialist.</p>

<p>Thanks for that "insight", explains why UKIP is gaining support from right,left and centre.<br/>Please try again.</p>

<p>('ere, you're not Fabian Solutions, are you?)</p>

<p>Of course not - I am a Tory voter.</p>

<p>Stop such mindless paranoia.</p>

<p>Sorry.<br/>Calm down dear.<br/>P.S. aint too many Tory voters left eh?<br/>Well not the "Brand Cameron Tory Lite" party anyway!</p>

<p>('ere, you're not Anna Soubry, are you?)</p>

<p>The immigrants working in the NHS are required to cope with, youv'e got it, the mass of immigrants. Take them out of the system and we could have a great NHS</p>

<p>No. The NHS has always been dependent on immigrant labour to function.</p>

<p>Throw the East Europeans out of the country, will the NHS be there for you when you need it?</p>

<p>That would be ok. Less people using the NHS means less staff. It's simple really.<br/>If you deliberately let in millions of immigrants then the NHS would collapse under the strain and that is what has happened. You have to take on more staff but with the same resources.<br/>Let's while we are at it debunk those that say immigration is cost effective.<br/>Take a Polish worker here on a wage of £15k pa married with two children. Gets working tax credits and child benefit and is eligible for housing allowance. Also factor in the massive increase in crime.<br/>We import beggars as though they are a commodity in short supply.</p>

<p>The NHS was there before they arrived and it will be there if they leave. There isn't a huge number of East Europeans working in the NHS.</p>

<p>Yes , let's keep on raping the health services in Africa, India and eastern Europe. We need the skilled workers those poorer nations have paid to train and we have the money to get them.Who cares if a few million have-nots suffer as long as Skinner is OK.</p>

<p>Because successive governments have failed to train enough nurses it is true that we suck foreign health services dry to pad out the NHS. That is a sickness in itself.</p>

<p>So we've established that Reckless is going to lose his seat next May then.  Must be a very disappointing result for you 'kippers.</p>

<p>Well according to those who know everything , he wasn't going to win it this time and if he did Cameron would have to resign . Any word from No10 yet ?</p>

<p>Do you also know the winning lottery numbers for next week? Care to share them? :-p</p>

<p>More garbage from Farage, Carswell and Reckless.</p>

<p>If you vote UKIP, you might get a very small number of UKIP seats, but you will still more likely get a Labour government - you won't get UKIP into government, come hell or high water.</p>

<p>Do those numpties really think that a startup party like UKIP can treat the electorate as if they are idiots?</p>

<p>Are you trying to suggest there is a difference between Labour and Tories and that by voting Tory you will get a referendum, I suggest you keep taking the tablets,:- NURSE NURSE COME QUICKLY PLEASE</p>

<p>Yes, I am. Miliband is a Marxist, who wants to take the UK back to the 60s/70s.</p>

<p>There would be a referendum, without doubt, if the Tories won a majority.</p>

<p>Using your logic and defeatist attitude no one would ever do anything of national significance, because they could not do everything at the very start of the development.<br/>UKIP has gone from a small party with a few MEPs to being the dominant party representing the UK in the EU and have reached critical mass in popular elections.<br/>UKIP has gone from having no MPs to having two now. <br/>UKIP have gone from having very few councilors to having many and actually controlling councils.<br/>These developments have all happened in the past 12 months.</p>

<p>As Harold Wilson said in 1964 a week is a long time in politics. Six months is a very, very long time as defined by the late Labour leader, and that is what time we have before the general election.<br/>Plenty of time for us 'numpties' to get our message across and  to get our supporters out to vote.</p>

<p>I am the least defeatist person you would ever come across - I never give up, especially with numpty UKIP supporters who are under-educated, disgruntled, disaffected, racist, xenophobic, misogynistic and in favour of privatising the NHS and repatriating immigrants.</p>

<p>UKIP is a one-trick, one-issue party led by a gurning charlatan with an alcohol problem.</p>

<p>He has two lieutenants now who are disloyal by nature, and will dump Farage at the earliest opportunity - they are both 43, incredibly ambitious and have already displayed a tendency to disagree with their current leader.</p>

<p>Can you imagine gullible Lefty voters sticking with a far-right Tory party, once they wake up and see who their bedfellows are?</p>

<p>I can see by your fabricated image of UKIP you are not often right Jake, but you are wrong again. Keep supporting Labour you deserve each other,...losers together.</p>

<p>I say it as it is!</p>

<p>I hope you are not a gambling man, though, son.</p>

<p>I am a right-wing voter, but not far-right like UKIP.</p>

<p>If you think UKIP is far right, I can only imagine you don't know your right from your left. Plus you don't have any sense of balance to call upon to help you judge  who is where on the political spectrum</p>

<p>UKIP is a far-right party which did the grubbiest deal imaginable with the extreme-right KNP, so that it could grub another million out of the taxpayers.</p>

<p>The far-right Front National would not have anything to do with the KNP!</p>

<p>Oh dear, you are a delusional conspiracy believer as well as being wrong.</p>

<p>It is the UKIP crowd who are the anti-rationality party, who have fantasised about an EU out to get them, take away their sovereignty, etc.</p>

<p>It is the stuff that psychiatrists see as a meal ticket.</p>

<p>There is no conspiracy from the EU. It has 27 other member countries which do not obsess about it.</p>

<p>Raise your drawbridge if it makes you feel better.</p>

<p>Quite the reverse, we intend to lower the draw bridge of opportunity by allowing access to the world market which includes Europe within that wider horizon.</p>

<p>So the UK does not export its goods and services outside the EU to the tune of around 50% of the total?</p>

<p>Yes the UK does export outside of the EU much to the surprise of the LibLabCon adherents. The thing is; the Westminster troika keep trying to convince the electorate there is no chance of economic activity outside of the EU.<br/>When it is pointed out to them the EU is the largest economic block in decline in the world as a proportion of world export activity, the Europhiles conveniently choose to skip over that small detail just as they skate over the failure of major economies in the Eurozone and skate over high unemployment and skate over riots now an almost daily activity in France, Italy, and Greece. <br/>If you are putting yourself forward as the champion of the EU maybe you would like to give us a list of the positives the EU brings to our lives.</p>

<p>Your are twisting things inside out to try and make an unsupportable case.</p>

<p>Farage's Follies make an assertion that an EU exit will be no problem, as effectively the UK will lose no business in the process. But, in any case, that any loss could be made up in non-EU countries.</p>

<p>There has been no suggestion, no statement, that the EU or related organisations will offer exactly the same trading terms on a UK exit from the EU. Why should they give similarly favourable terms to a non-member which has made a point of attacking the EU for years?</p>

<p>That also ignores the action being taken by the USA to form a free trade bloc with the EU.</p>

<p>In addition, UKIP's flawed claims assume that the global economy outside the EU will tolerate increased exports by the UK in straitened times.</p>

<p>China is heading for its slowest growth in 24 years; the rest of the BRICs are heading the same way and closer to recession.</p>

<p>Overall, the global economy's growth rate slows period by period and is now at its slowest for a couple of decades.</p>

<p>In that extremely difficult environment, along with the problems faced by the UK's own economy, UKIP thinks there is no problem in cutting its EU advantages.</p>

<p>The advantages of EU membership have been set out frequently in the public arena - you would have read of them, but are being deliberately obtuse.</p>

<p>By the way, the EU is a bloc, not a block.</p>

<p>As for market share, you deliberately ignore the previous rate of growth in China, in particular, running at 10% to 12% per year for at least a couple of decades.</p>

<p>With slower global growth, overhanging debt by most of the world, a challenging UK debt problem, etc, it would be criminally stupid to exit the EU on the basis of obsessive rants by Farage and his acolytes.</p>

<p>If the EU advantages are set out in the public arena, feel free to list the first three you think are the most relevant to this discussion.  Don't feel embarrassed, just one limitation you can't claim it has been responsible for keeping the peace since 1945 in Europe.<br/>Over to you.</p>

<p>I feel free to say what I want, without anyone's invitation, thank you.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, you are just a time waster who will dismiss whatever facts, logic or sense that any thinking person would present to you.</p>

<p>You have been brainwashed by that populist charlatan and gurning champion into thinking that an EU exit would in some misguided way help the UK. I think it would be a disaster in many ways.</p>

<p>Like all Europhiles who have gone before you,who claim the EU has resulted in positive achievements, they like you are unable to list any.<br/>I would contend it is you that is brainwashed. <br/>You have accepted the EU propaganda without challenge and when you are asked to justify the existence of the EU there is nothing forthcoming.<br/>We at UKIP love  Europe, many of us have deep roots in Europe. I have personally opened a company in Dusseldorf. Nigel's wife is German, we have no negative emotions, and have no negative views about our European cousins.<br/>We hate the corrupt undemocratic EU and we will continue to work tirelessly to see it closed down for the good of all Europeans not just those living in the UK.</p>

<p>Now you are resorting to having to make assertions; you should stop digging.</p>

<p>You yourself must have read articles showing the advantages of remaining in the EU. However, you claim that I can't do that, even though I alerted you to the point.</p>

<p>You have admitted a hate for the EU, which is an emotion I do not possess. It indicates that the factual has been overridden by emotional influences.</p>

<p>There is corruption in business, politics and most other human endeavours, but the EU is being singled out by the obsessed UKIP to draw attention to themselves. The UKIP charlatans have sought to use the EU as a magnet of blame for all ills.</p>

<p>Exiting the EU will not fix what UKIP claims, but will certainly undermine British businesses across the board.</p>

<p>Many jobs will be put at risk, the economy will be negatively impacted and in years to come UKIP would be blamed.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that the the UK voters will see sense, like the Scots did in their referendum.</p>

<p>You really are confused about UKIP aren't you. Yes of course I have read some of the proaganda put out by the Europhiles and never has it been convincing or even supported by hard facts.<br/>You again claim exiting the corrupt undemocratic EU would cost the UK jobs. <br/>In one sense you are right, it would end the £480,000/year MEP (salary and allowances) group of public sector workers. It would also lead to a reduction in civil servants and all their alowances travelling to Brussels and Strasbourg and all parts of Europe.<br/>It would have no material impact of mainstream employment outside those allocated to political posturing.<br/>You are correct also, to repeat my, and many, many, other people's hatred of paying tax money into an organisation that produces no positive outcomes. You can't name any, and no one has yet managed to name any positive impact for the £13billion net payment of UK money sent to the EU last year.<br/>I am sorry you find assertions unacceptable? We will continue digging for the truth about the EU.  UKIP is  revealing the full extent of corruption in the EU we will continue doing that.<br/> I would urge you to look at the Tax Payers Alliance data if you want a non political view of the EU and its disgraceful waste of European tax payers money.<br/>You may not like what you see, then again judging by your blind adherence to the EU I expect you will skip over the sections you don't like.</p>

<p>UKIP just did the grubbiest deal in politics, with its arrangement with an extreme-right Polish party, the KNP.  That is a party that even the far-right Front national said they would not go near!</p>

<p>UKIP has no principles or ethics and was driven, by Farage's own admission, simply by its quest for more taxpayers' money!</p>

<p>UKIP just accepted what a dodgy businessman, Arron Banks, claimed was a one million pound donation. This guy operates virtually totally, if not actually totally, in tax havens and pays virtually no UK tax. His former business organisation has now brought a civil action against him.</p>

<p>You persist in making false claims that I can't list advantages of the EU, because I refused to get in to discussing them, although the public arena is full of discussion on that. That is typical and normal for UKIP supporters - when they are challenged they claim 'smears', but then attack the challengers with smears themselves.</p>

<p>I would love to see UKIP's fully-detailed cost-benefit analysis by respected international accountants and economists which show the net position about the EU. All we ever see from UKIP is the cost of membership.</p>

<p>And, of course, they keep quiet about the costs for their MEPs, and how they spend all that taxpayers' money. They are even worse, and hypocritical to boot, than the UK MPs who abused expenses!</p>

<p>Well still no list of advantages I see. Just resorting to insults and attempts to discredit people who operate within a flawed tax system legally worldwide. Just like Google, Amazon, Vodafone, Microsoft, Dell, the list is almost as long as the FT 100 or the Dow operate within the letter of the law.<br/>You may not like the sharp practices adopted and indeed encouraged by the current EU president Juncker, the ex prime minister of Luxembourg that operates as a tax haven within the EU.  It is clear he knowingly set up that arrangement to the disadvantage of other EU members. He was made President of the corrupt EU for his excellent work.<br/>Let us leave corruption within the EU aside and return to the question of EU benefits to the UK. <br/>Go on, break the through your resistance to outline the benefit of the EU...or is it you can't because there are none?</p>

<p>If you have not bothered to keep yourself informed about the advantages of the EU, that is your problem.</p>

<p>It is not my role in life to inform the uninformed and misinformed, so your imitation of Peter Parrot butters no parsnips.</p>

<p>Like all UKIP supporters, you never challenge specific points against UKIP, but proceed to ride off in all directions. Now you are ranting away with an uncoordinated, incoherent charge about the ills of the EU.</p>

<p>We've read the same UKIP BS so many times before about ''corruption'', but you seem to excel yourself by moving the goalposts to now include tax avoidance. Whatever next? Ebola?</p>
