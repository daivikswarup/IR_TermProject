<p>'Trump's not wrong - we can't even wear uniform in our OWN cars': Five police officers claim US tycoon is RIGHT about parts of London being so 'radicalised' they are no-go areas <br/>A report from the Mail of police confirmation of Donald Trump,s claim of police no go areas in London</p>

<p>The quiz was very difficult and that in itselt says a LOT!</p>

<p>Earlier this evening on social media I saw the Prime Minister described as a terrorist! No doubt 'Stop the war' (STW) might agree with that sentiment, but I find that view offensive.<br/>The first duty of any Prime Minister is the defence of this country against terrorists or any other threats...<br/>Last week's Commons debate was about a detailed strategy on Syria-not just about sending in the RAF. It seems the other parts of that strategy, the Vienna talks, for example, have been conveniently ignored by STW and others.<br/>STW can therefore present our government as the aggressor! They say there is no mandate for what the RAF are now doing. Wrong. The UN has asked its members to work together to destroy isis; the UK government has been asked to help by the French...<br/>If the Paris attacks had happened in London and the French refused to help us deal with the people responsible, what would STW have done then?? STW have not answered that question; they seem unwilling to do so...<br/>Why? Because STW have no credible alternative plan.</p>

<p>Horrifying organisation.  I wonder if the useful idiots who go on their marches have any clue they are effectively supporting Assad, Putin and Hamas or if they're too morally smug and intellectually lazy to care.</p>

<p>For me Corbyn's (very) close association is Exhibit A in the case against his leadership of any sane, rational party with designs on power.</p>

<p>"To be clear, there remains a very important difference between Isil and Stop the War"</p>

<p>Indeed. ISIL actually put themselves on the line for their evil ideology. Their supporters on the British left just sit in their armchairs and cheer.</p>

<p>'Stop the War' is merely the political face of ISIS</p>

<p>The Sinn Fein of ISIS</p>

<p>But Stop one side of the war by their rhetoric seek to inflame Muslim attitude's to the British state. So, in their deeds they want to create violence.</p>

<p>Heh! Well said!</p>

<p>If only Jeremy would share with us more of his true feelings about the world situation. STW and all that madness. But Milne seems to have instructed him not to disclose his true world view, which is identical to the world view expressed by the Guardian editorial management in their choice of presentations, and we are forced to rely on various videos and recordings, some way back just before he was democratically elected leader of the Labor Party.</p>

<p>A sad situation. The Guardian editorial management cannot be quizzed publicly as to its basic world view. But jeremy can. And he seems to be dodging all the difficult questions.</p>

<p>I should think STW consistently say things like, 'We need to condemn the blowing to bits of civilians by ANY organization, be it IS, the US army, the Israeli army or anyone else. Many more innocent Muslim civilians have been killed by the US/UK/Israeli military since 2003 than by Muslim terrorists (at least tens of thousands if you check reputable online sources).'</p>

<p>Can anybody logically disagree with the above assertion?</p>

<p>Yes, because it is highly misleading. Civilian casualties in war are sad but hard to avoid completely even when you try. The IS <b>targets</b> civilians, which is a major difference. By ignoring this fact, the statement is skewed.</p>

<p>Btw, I am not so sure about who is responsible for the most civilian deaths. Most victims of IS and other terrorists have been Muslims after all.</p>

<p>Agree. ISIS are terrorists.They go after the civilian population while the western nations go to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. In fact, the US rules of engagement are so strict that they put our troops in unnecessary danger. If ISIS gets a nuke of some kind you can bet they will target a large city over any military installation.</p>

<p>I just did and at some length but it's been moderated out for some unfathomable reason.</p>

<p>Yep. It's hopelessly skewed and deeply misleading. To begin with STW may assert formulaically every now and then that they oppose all violence and issue occasional brief, ritual denouncements of groups like IS or especially brutal anti-Western regimes. But it's no more than politically expedient lipservice paid to their own ostensible purpose; 99.9% of their bile is still reserved for the West. Accordingly, STW's unchanging leitmotif with respect to these non-Western actors is that everything they do is ultimately the West's fault anyway for one contrived reason or another. Because in truth STW are anything but an anti-war movement. They're merely a bog-standard far-left anti-Western agit-prop one and indeed, "Stop-The-West" would be a more honest summary of their aims.</p>

<p>As for the second remark, presumably every last collateral casualty during warfighting, subsequent policing operations and Israeli (how did they get smuggled into this, eh?) retaliatory or preemptive actions are being numbered in the tally. So in purely arithmetic terms, yes, I'd imagine the statement is superficially accurate. Although ISIL's recent activities in Syria and Iraq must be closing the gap considerably.</p>

<p>Yet even so it remains grossly misleading and misrepresentational. Let's just look at Israel's case, as you've dragged them in, hoping someone will do so.</p>

<p>And by the way, forget the politics and defunct peace talks and conflicting land claims and settlements and "right of return" and... blah, blah, blah, fee-fi-fo-fum with a cherry on the top! -All the stale, convoluted propaganda and mutual accusations that emanate from both parties to that most insoluble of conflicts and that's then sifted selectively and embellished by both sides' adherents to screech at each other in online games of atrocity whist with faux-moral trumps. You set the narrow military/terror/casualty parameters here. I at least will respect them.</p>

<p>Accordingly, at first sight it seems your remark is validated even more as Israel's operations in Gaza and Lebanon have undoubtedly inflicted far more casualties than has terror directed against her own population. As usual though, what's lacking is a bit of reasoned analysis and provision of context. Firstly because like Western interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria etc, this is an asymmetric conflict between a professional military and irregular opponents with no airpower and less sophisticated armaments in general. It's pinpoint airstrike vs area bombardment. Conventional land operations vs guerrilla ones. Something that dictates heavily each side's modus operandi.</p>

<p>That being said though, within the frameworks established by those respective m.o's a wide range of tactical options still remain open to each party. It's how that flexibility is exploited by each that permits context to be applied and analysis undertaken. And in this, and the Western operations elsewhere too, a clear, consistent pattern emerges.</p>

<p>Thus, in the Israeli/moslem "hot" flare-ups cited above, the IAF mounted thousands of sorties and Hamas and Hizbollah launched thousands of rockets. Yet as a general rule, whereas the Israelis used their pinpoint strike capability to try to avoid civilian casualties, the terror groups' aim was to maximise them. And seemingly not just of Israeli civilians but of their own too, for propaganda purposes.</p>

<p>The IAF then routinely gave advance warning of strikes. By leaflet, phone, broadcast and in the final stages,"roof knocking". On many occasions strikes were aborted due to the risk of their inflicting unacceptable collateral damage. The terrorists used their rocket arsenals to mount indiscriminate surprise attacks against predominantly civilian Israeli targets. Launching the munitions typically from their own densely populated civilian areas and on occasion, actively using their own civilians as human shields. Hamas in fact did so routinely during all three of the Gaza conflicts.</p>

<p>In 2006, Hizbollah at least did have the capacity to mount a concentrated barrage of hundreds of rockets at once against single, known major industrial targets and/or military depots, had it wished. And that is indeed the conventional military use to which such area bombardment weapons are put. But Hizbo didn't do that at all. Rather, it launched a constant stream of attacks against widely dispersed civilian targets. Almost all with no military presence or industrial value whatsoever.</p>

<p>Why then did so few Israeli civilians die while so many equally innocent moslem ones were killed? In part, it was just an inevitable consequence of asymmetric warfare itself. Something that has applied consistently in all such episodes. Yet in the cases described and the Western operations as well, the tactics of the respective combatants also had an impact. Few Western civilians have died in terror attacks because Western governments have invested huge resources in intelligence and other countermeasures to forestall them. Few Israeli civilians died under terrorist rocket attack because Israel has spent billions providing public shelters, early warning systems and missile defence, as well as requiring that all domestic dwellings must have reinforced shelters or safe rooms of their own. More moslem civilians died than need have because their "rulers" not only neglected to provide any protective infrastructure at all (and Hamas and Hizbo's extensive concrete bunker and tunnel networks for use exclusively by the fighters themselves suggest it was feasible that they could have) but often sought proactively to maximise risk or even casualties amongst their own civilians. While their enemies sought the very opposite by trying to avoid inflicting them.</p>

<p>So In conclusion, the mere arithmetic doesn't even begin to inform the truth. Because what we've actually seen is a series of conflicts involving civilised states that as well as valuing and seeking to preserve the lives of their own people, are also willing to handicap and increase risk to their military forces by applying that same informing value to the people of their enemies. While those enemies not only seek to kill as many opposed troops and civilians as possible, quite without distinction, but are also at best blithe to the safety of their own people and at worst, willing to sacrifice them to protect their combatants and to generate publicity to bolster their barbaric cause.</p>

<p>Well said.</p>

<p>Cheers! In fact the dead giveaway about the real nature of STW is Robbie's smuggling Israel into his comment at all. The "STW Coalition" began as a genuinely heterogeneous movement directed to opposing specifically the 2003 Iraq operation. Then, its adherents included people who disagreed with the invasion for a whole gamut of reasons ranging from "oooh! Impewialism! Howwid colonialist impewialism!" on the ideological left, to "this third world cesspit and its comic opera dictator are not worth the life of a single British squaddie"  on the isolationist right.</p>

<p>Inevitably, it was later hijacked by the far left and transformed into what it remains today as the other participants dropped it like a hot brick. Just another bog-standard anti-West agit-prop groupuscule. I say "inevitably" as it's the unexcepted rule in such cases. The far left's starey-eyed "activists" invariably subvert all such organisations. They're professional demo and meeting goers and as classic cultists, have all the persistence of fanaticism. So of course every last conflict between parties they view already through their rigid ideological filter is now grist to STW's mill; Israel's included.</p>

<p>And the more rockets you shoot at Israel the more the IDF are going to stomp you into oblivion.</p>

<p>Yep. Anything wrong, btw, with "stomping" people who shoot things at you and your civilian population?</p>

<p>I'm an American liberal and I must say that the British left has always seemed insane.  The American right gets ever more disconnected from reality, but they would have to make friends with ISIS and adopt Hamas as beloved pets to approach the level of insanity I've seen from the British left.</p>

<p>Asking what the British left <i>thinks</i> feels like a category error.  Asking what George Galloway or Ken Livingstone thinks is like asking what Ebola tastes like, nothing good can come of it.</p>

<p>Ursula, Thank you for introducing that much admired, American long distance view on things and language to entertain in similar measure.<br/>As a one time avid listener of 'A letter from America' it is refreshing to see American reflections are not completely given over to sound bite politics, and auto cue speeches.</p>

<p>Quite. Better long distance truth and sanity than short distance hypocrisy, lies and smarmy, self-righteous ideological drivel.</p>

<p>The Telegraph Site Moderation throws people off this site for disagreeing with the views expressed by Stop the War.</p>

<p>The Stop The War slogan is not directed at the Taliban, ISIL/Daesh. Al Queda, Boko Haram, hardline Sunni or Shia militants, Assad, Putin or Tehran ... it is directed at mainstream conservative UK - at us - Britain and British people.</p>

<p>Stop The War has nothing to do with stopping any war ... it is a political device/organisation with the primary objective of stopping/disrupting our essential UK National Defence and UK National Security.</p>

<p>In the United States we're more efficient.  We compressed the entire work of the STWC into a single person, of the name Noam Chomsky.</p>

<p>I don't think someone who lives in a country where Donald Trump is a lead presidential candidate should be gloating.</p>

<p>Is that what I was doing, I couldn't tell.</p>

<p>And what exactly does STW get out of harming our national security?</p>

<p>Agenda and anarchy i.e. achieving political objectives.</p>

<p>Yes this is about their level.</p>

<p>I concur that there is Islamic terrorism and moderate Muslims' hearts must sink every time the attacker has an Arabic/S Asian/East African name.  And I concur that some mosques have radical elements in their congregations, and that Saudi Arabia evangelized the most horrible sect of Islam and we let it happen on our soil because we want to buy their oil and sell them our weapons.</p>

<p>But these jihadists aren't like other Muslims.  They are losers who want power, because they know they're only going to fit in with fellow misfits.</p>

<p>Indeed. We should send all who disagree with war to the concentration camps where they belong.</p>

<p>“Syrian government says US-led coalition hit army camp killing three soldiers”</p>

<p>Once again proving Washington is targeting Assad and not ISIS in Syria.</p>

<p>The question Washington must now answer is why is Washington protecting ISIS<br/>terrorist in Syria?</p>

<p>I<br/> wouldn't trust the Syrian government to tell black from white.</p>

<p>So<br/> nothing's been "proven" at all</p>

<p>And<br/>somehow I doubt Washington considers it "must" do anything at your behest and still less that of the indicted war criminal and mass murderer, Assad.</p>

<p>The Syrian government isn't bombing Britain, didn't invade Vietnam, didn't drop napalm on civilians in Cyprus, didn't commit the Armenian genocide, didn't invade Grenada, Congo, Columbia, El Salvador, didn't take out economic sanctions against Britain, Jamaica, Cuba, Eritrea, Iraq. The are dozens of regime changes the Syrian govt didn't initiate e.g. Ukraine, Yugoslavia, Chile. The Syrian govt doesn't back GCC nations like Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Syria doesn't support Israel's theft of the Golan Heights for its oil deposits.</p>

<p>I trust the Syrian government more than Cameron. British planes have been implicated in that specific attack on the Syrian base. But like the murders at the Afghan MSF hospital, NATO will deny, deny and deny some more.</p>

<p>Mass murdering US presidency is now destabilising Europe, assisted by Turkey and Britain, it's about time our government (Cameron) was indicted. </p>

<p>Yeah, save it all for your next SWP yoof section meeting.</p>

<p>Oh, hang on. I missed this bit.</p>

<p>""British planes have been implicated in that specific attack on the Syrian base.""</p>

<p>Good! Then the job will have been done properly.</p>

<p>Yeah , im up for stopping the war, we gotta win first.</p>

<p>And to win we must stop people being born into our country that will turn to evil once they reach that age.</p>

<p>Its bad enough letting people in who then do us harm, but to let in people who think to pop out 2/4/5/6/7 Children is good for this country then think again.</p>

<p>We must stop restrict the numbers, those Born here and those we let in.</p>

<p>For this we do not need bullets , Bombs or Airstrikes.</p>

<p>Just common sense.</p>

<p>There's clearly even less point arguing with you than there is with the lunatics from the other far fringe.</p>

<p>He may not be particularly articulate but he speaks common sense. I guess articulacy is not a problem for you whereas ..................</p>

<p>Actually he speaks a lot of prejudiced bull. There are about 4 million British Moslems who are every last bit as entitled as you or I to live here because they're British subjects under the  equal rule of Common Law, as are we. Many were born here. Others were not. Yet of all four million just a few hundred have run off to join IS or other lunatic terrorists,</p>

<p>So afaics, our odious fascist above's post boils down to being nothing more than a bog-standard anti-moslem-immigration rant. But I'll address that later. Firstly I think I should make plain a few points on my own behalf in case you're mistaking me for one of his equally bigoted far-left alter egos..</p>

<p>Insofar as future policy is concerned, I support massive curbs on immigration, myself. To be introduced asap, and with the suspension of most immigration during the lead time for formulation of the details. Concerning which, I subscribe to the idea of operating a stringent points-based system capped in respect of individual skill sets according to assessed shortages in specific areas that cannot be met from the domestic population. After which, those admitted would also face a minimal three year moratorium on eligibility for all and any state benefits -tax credits included.<br/>.<br/>Indeed, I'd go further still in several respects. Firstly, I'd require that almost all immigrants must be fluently Anglophone as a basic condition of admission. Secondly, I would make an explicit separation between admission as a resident to work here and the bestowal of British Subject status so that the second could no longer follow quasi-automatically from the first. A measure that I'd link to a removal of the now outmoded and non-reciprocal right to vote in UK elections of resident nationals of countries that were once part of our former Empire.<br/>.<br/>The reason for all this is as follows. On a personal level, I consider myself to be a British patriot and believe that we owe no one else a single damn thing beyond common courtesy, equal justice under the rule of impartial law, and normal consideration as fellow human beings. We certainly owe no one a free lunch and have as much right as any other People to consider our own interests first. Therefore, our immigration policy should be premised exclusively on the needs of this country, not of the immigrant.</p>

<p>No one has some "as of right" prerogative to come here just because they want to. This is our land; that of the British People collectively. All of us; and here our writ runs and our laws alone carry force by fiat of our sovereign will, democratically expressed and implemented constitutionally via our ancient institutions.<br/>.<br/>Finally, our citizenship is a precious thing and not to be bestowed lightly. Still less is it to be scattered about like confetti as is presently all too often the case. I believe then, that It is incumbent upon those who seek it to demonstrate more than a purely economic commitment to enriching themselves by working here. My view on this may be best expressed by paraphrasing the words used allegedly by a former Australian PM when describing his own country's approach.<br/>.<br/>""We don't care where you come from, what your colour is or what your faith may be. But if you choose to come here then it's on the understanding that this becomes your country and you become Australian. In the fullest sense. You join your identity and future to our own and become part of our common Australian dream"".</p>

<p>From all of which, as I move back to address the bigot's  post, you may gather that I don't envisage barring anyone simply on grounds of their religion. Tbh, that seems to me to be as obnoxious and un-British as insisting on screening applicants to ensure only social democrats or conservatives get in, and discriminating either in favour of or against moslems in that way falls into the same bracket.</p>

<p>As for our existing immigrant, and especially moslem population, what do you suggest be done? Our ultra-right idiot's somewhat disjointed rant is a tad dark on that one, although reading between the lines I'm not sure I like the implications. In fact I think they're obscene and had I or my immediate forebears emigrated somewhere such suggestions were made (far too often) just on account of the faith they and I (if I had one) profess, I'd be damned inclined to fight for it myself.   .</p>

<p>Of more concern than the few Jihadis though, are the numbers of alienated young moslem Brits who won't run off to strap 50lbs of semtex round their guts and try to project their disjecta membra into low earth orbit. Yet who're still vulnerable to radicalisation by extreme Islamist hate preachers. However, even that's a two pronged problem. Dealing with the preachers and activists more severely and expeditiously iaw the law when they break it is a must. Not least because as well as removing their direct influence, it should also help with the second contributory factor.<br/>.<br/>By muting people like matey-boy and several others I've seen here, because they're the mad Imams' very best little helpers and make their own task much easier. <br/>.<br/>Yet emasculate the bigots on both sides -and add in the just but unambiguous measures to which I alluded above- and most issues will begin to resolve themselves.The far-leftist ideologues who love every culture but their own will be stymied too and their poisonous "salad bowl" concept of "multiculturalism" consigned to the dustbin of history where it belongs, So the idea that it's normal to live parallel lives in near-hermetically sealed ethnic ghettos will also lose currency.</p>

<p>If one law is applied equally to all without exception and the "affirmative" gesturism of subjective, anti-libertarian "hate crime" legislation is eschewed, notions of victimisation on one hand and preferential treatment on the other will be dissipated. If the supply of imported "as of right" spouses is discontinued along with mass immigration generally, the demographic timebomb will be defused as moslem birth rates converge with those of the general population. As was, in fact, happening before the irresponsible, covert mass immigration begun in the Blair years (that as yet, Cameron's doing nothing about) reversed that trend. <br/>.<br/>Assimilation to a single, contemporary British culture and identity that draws on the best of all contributing elements will then follow naturally as it always has in analogous cases throughout history.</p>

<p>The Pakistani pair that murdered 14 people in San Bernadino have never been to Syria, neither has the Somalian who tried to cut a man's head off in Leytonstone.  "For Syria" my azz.  The vast majority of Syrians despise Daesh.  The vast majority of Syrians want a secular - not Islamic - state.</p>

<p>Rashad Razaq wrote an enlightening piece for the Evening Standard.  He says that young Muslims are becoming more devout, partly as a way to differentiate themselves from their parents and grandparents.  In other words, we are allowing stupid kids to re-define everything, from politics to religion.</p>

<p>That there are a handful of old peaceniks like Corbyn and Andrew Murray carrying cards for SWC, and old Wahhabi goats for jihadist groups, doesn't matter.  If it wasn't for the young's obsession with rebellion, these groups would barely exist, much less get so much air time.</p>

<p>Isil attracts psychopathic losers, and no one else.  Whether they're 15 or 50, male or female. If Isil didn't exist, these dead-enders would back some other group of crazies.  If not Syria and Iraq, it's some other place - one that we aren't bombing. Stop The War Coalition makes no distinction between countries and causes,</p>

<p>Razaq poses the question to the children and overgrown children who choose to "out Muslim" their parents:  "Is this really how you want to define yourself - by religion?".  But he misses the point.  Wisdom comes with emotional age.</p>

<p>So who is really responsible?  Well, people have always protested against military adventures.  I protested myself against the Vietnam War.  But as I have pointed out many times, the radical left - led entirely by college students with no work/life experience - set the cause of ending that conflict by years because they used it as a convenient excuse to do what they would have done in its absence.  Create havoc and "stick it to" the old folks.</p>

<p>They were facilitated by governments, who fixated on youth/children.  The "yoof" rule, and they know it.</p>

<p>Top comment. Research shows that many jihadists have some form of depression or mild psychological inbalance. Many are already involved in petty crime, have a drug habit, are into western fashion &amp; youth culture, particularly hip hop. Hardly devout Muslims. The French/Belgian terrorists fitted this profile. Few attend the mosque and their prejudice towards say Jews, Western society or gays is usually influenced by a dominant male parent or relative. Many millennials - Muslim or not - are angry and attracted to violence (like social media Corbynistas &amp; many agitprop rally activists) fed by a culture of virtual &amp; continuous upheaval - from the 24 hour news cycle and video games, where killing is fun. Most of the violence &amp; extreme bigotry and hate drips out of our campuses &amp; our streets picked up by a generation fired up with loathing for the world. The Twatter hate messages to MPs who made a democratic decision over Syria reflect this as many were sent by millennials.</p>

<p>Just read a story today that the woman who carried out the San Bernardino attack with her husband was radicalised at uni in Pakistan.</p>

<p>Yep, and there are always going to be people who're vulnerable to such indoctrination everywhere but afaicr, more typically our Western moslem terrorists are home grown, so to speak. I think Raven King makes some very cogent points. As you also do in your preceding post, for that matter.</p>

<p>Mummy never spanked them hard enough when they were little?</p>

<p>There are "mature" members of SWC.  However, the Weather Underground  (remember them?) were all a bunch of pampered students (mainly post graduates) who had never worked a day in their lives (until they became adults - in their 40s!).</p>

<p>They despised the parents who spoiled them.  And I think, regardless of the socio-economic condition, you will find that a lot of terrorists could do no wrong in their parents' estimation.  In every case the parents say, "But he/she was such a good student/son/daughter, always polite, blah blah...we had no idea he/she had these awful thoughts" as if dressing like an imam or a bat and becoming more and more withdrawn from Western culture didn't give them a clue?</p>

<p>It's because parents see their children through a different prism than we see them.  Or more to the point, they want the world to see their children as perfect, as they see their children are a reflection of good or bad parenting.  And governments play along, deeming all children to be innocent victims of something or other, even when they're the literal spawn of Satan.  My inclination is to protect children - the problem is, you can't protect them from their own parents, who allow them to engage in anti-social behavior and crime because they can't admit they didn't give them the necessary tools to evolve into a decent, law-abiding member of society.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Yep, sorry. But I know the technique backwards and it wasn't impressive even before that.</p>

<p>Seriously though, it should be pretty damned obvious that islamic terrorists are very savvy at taking any sign of doubt or dissent amongst the infidel and using it to demoralise the more spineless and feeble minded amongst us.</p>

<p>A classic example of this was when Judge Beckett opined during the islamocompliant show trial of Marine A that the alleged execution was liable to incite reprisal attacks by the Taliban.</p>

<p>Strange he says that. As a keen observer I would have said the Taliban were pretty much bent on maiming, torturing and generally slaughtering us infidel from the outset (as Marine A would doubtless have informed judge Beckett from his harrowing personal experience) and required precious little motivation from us...</p>

<p>...However, if what they really appreciate (and they most assuredly do) is help in finding a way to create dissent and degrade public support for our military then making asinine statements like that of judge Beckett was more than they could have ever hoped for. The next attack would almost certainly be trumpeted by the Taliban as revenge for Marine A's action, not because the Taliban were greatly bothered about what he did but solely because idiots like Beckett had signalled loud and clear to them that is was what they should say after their next attack for maximum propaganda effect.</p>

<p>Much the same traitorous logic is employed by the likes of Corbyn and Stop the War so it shouldn't be of any surprise that ISIS seem very well in tune with their propaganda.</p>

<p>Excellent point. The terrorists and the pro-JIhadist left are essentially working together. I'm not suggesting they're in direct communication (although stranger things have happened) but they do very clearly coordinate the messages they put out.</p>

<p>Some idiot Tory said it I would guess.</p>

<p>While at the same time plotting to bomb some Middle East hellhole and create millions of refugees with the sole aim of keeping property prices high and wages low in the UK.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, here we have a sobering example of the tragic consequences of chewing lead soldiers during pregnancy . . . . .</p>

<p>It is  very odd that the loonies consider the Tories collectively, to be idiots but the Tories have a tendency to win the arguments - and the important elections too -  but the loonies always lose.</p>

<p>Why could this be?</p>

<p>Ah, glad you crawled out of your hole again, the foaming-mouthed demented loonjob who has the temerity to call other people "loonies".</p>

<p>Some idiot Labour, Brown brought in tax credits which pays people to remain poor and subsidies private business. The reason pay is low in the UK tax credits. </p>

<p>Christ on a bike, you people are so very very stupid.</p>

<p>As apposed to your eloquent and erudite repost? I particularly liked your use of 'you people'. </p>

<p>Plus mass immigration of dirt poor young men</p>

<p>Ah yes, blame the Other, anything but look at the core issues...</p>

<p>I am fed up of hearing about Corbyn's 'mandate'. He has no such thing. At the last general election some tens of million people voted for Labour Party candidates. The leader should be elected by the Parliamentary Labour Party and no-one else - not the Unions, not constituency activists, not ordinary members, otherwise what is the purpose of a general election?<br/>How can Corbyn be described as a 'leader' when most of the PLP refuse to be led by him?</p>

<p>The PLP had a strong say in the changes to the leadership election process which led to Corbyn's election. I believe the consensus, after Miliband's loss of the general election, was that a completely transparent and inclusive process was necessary in order to elect a leader who would have maximal appeal among the electorate. So to some extent they are reaping what they themselves sowed.</p>

<p>But you make my point.  Corbyn was 'elected' by some 250,000 activists, as against several tens of millions voting for Labour parliamentary candidates. To say that 250,000 voters out of a population of some 60 million is 'transparent' and 'inclusive' is clearly ludicrous. Those that voted for Corbyn in this 'leadership' election are just simply a tiny selection of activists seizing an opportunity whilst the remainder of the country were not motivated to participate - but that is not to say that the rest of the country are not concerned about this vote. Support by 250,000 out of 60 million is in no way a mandate. Where is the evidence that Corbyn has maximal appeal amongst the eletorate, let alone those who voted for Labour at the general election?</p>

<p>Neither</p>

<p>Design work on the A10 began in 1940, for a projected first flight to take place in 1946. The initial design was carried out by Ludwig Roth und Graupe and was completed on 29 June 1940. Hermann Oberth worked on the design during 1941, and in December 1941 Walter Thiel proposed that the A10 use an engine composed of six bundled A4 engines, which it was thought would give a total thrust of 180 tonnes.</p>

<p>Work on the A10 was resumed in late 1944 under the Projekt Amerika codename, and the A10's design was amended to incorporate a cluster of 6 A4 combustion chambers feeding into a single expansion nozzle. This was later altered to a massive single chamber and single nozzle. Test stands were constructed at Peenemunde for firings of the 200 tonne thrust motor.</p>

<p>It was considered that existing guidance systems would not be accurate enough over a distance of 5,000 km, and it was decided to make the A9 piloted. The pilot was to be guided on his terminal glide towards the target by radio beacons on U-boats and by automatic weather stations landed in Greenland and Labrador.</p>

<p>The final design of the A10 booster was approximately 20 m (66 ft) in height. Powered by a 1,670 kN (380,000 lbf) thrust rocket burning diesel oil and nitric acid, during its 50-second burn it would have propelled its A9 second stage to a speed of about 4,300 km/h (2,700 mph) and an altitude of 400 km (250 mi).[29]</p>

<p>UK Tory MP, Nadhim Zahawi, caught selling ISIL Oil</p>

<p> This vile man stood up in the House in of Commons and made a very aggressive case for bombing Syria. Why can't these pieces of human filth be prosecuted? Why are we forced to see these corrupt ministers caught out over and over again and all that happens is that they deny it and life carries on.....and so do they, with absolutely no penalties at all!  <a href="http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=619_1437121336#TlWoEtWh1hT1QcYk.01" rel="nofollow">http://www.liveleak.com/view?i...</a></p>

<p>""This vile man stood up in the House in of Commons and made a very aggressive case for bombing Syria. Why can't these pieces of human filth be prosecuted? ""</p>

<p>Er? .....ISIL! ..No, wait a minute; ..."Stop The War"..    I think?...</p>

<p>...um?...   No, ISIL after all. Yep, I'll go for ISIL.</p>

<p>STW may not kill people directly but the people they support kill plenty. </p>

<p>"David Cameron has publicly thanked the person who shouted “you aint no muslim bruv" at the Leytonstone attacker for his “brilliant” comment."</p>

<p>But, but ... that's not true, is it, because that person IS a muslim.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The 'person' may well be a muslim, but the comment is irony, the 'person' was not behaving according to Islamic ideals.</p>

<p>It's considered a great sin (takfir) in Islam to decide that someone else isn't a Muslim. And the Q'uran instructs Muslims to "strike the necks of the unbelievers". <a href="http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=8&amp;verse=12" rel="nofollow">http://corpus.quran.com/transl...</a></p>

<p>I'm sure the victim has publicly thanked David Cameron for his open border policy and appeasement of so-called asylum economic migrant seekers?</p>

<p>Of course it fits in with Dave's view, that not all Muslims are bad people in fact what Britain needs is many more Muslims.</p>

<p>Surely 'Dave' wouldn't say anything that's not true??<br/>I believe that the potential killer had photos/memos in his wallet showing ISIL people/quotations??</p>

<p>We could supply the Syrian "moderates" (ie there aren't any) with the tanks and then watch the Russians blowing up the kit we have just supplied - for that's where our tax payers' money is going.</p>

<p>So where and to whom have they sold to?</p>

<p>I see they stopped giving the "aid" when they realised that 9as usual) it was going to supply the enemy. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-25331241" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/worl...</a></p>

<p>"Given" not sold.</p>

<p>Crumbs, oh no... what idiot allowed that?</p>

<p>Probably classed as "foreign aid"</p>

<p>So far we have given Syrian "moderates" (ie anyone anti-Assad) only "non-lethal" aid. I understand this to be landrovers etc. I presume the Russians are now blowing these up.</p>

<p>That's ok. It seems the US and/or ourselves may now be blowing up the quite lethal kit Russia's given her own stooge while indiscriminately bombing anyone opposed to him (ie anyone anti-Assad)</p>

<p>I'm sure Vlad will soon get the message.</p>

<p>Wow I did rubbish - 3/10. Seems I really can't tell the difference between the rhetoric coming out of the hard of thinking left and ISIS.</p>

<p>Or you're just so thick that you happily fill in a fatuous quiz in a standard Torygraph clickbait article?</p>

<p>I gather you only managed two, then.</p>

<p>The multicultural war.</p>

<p>Eh?</p>

<p>It seems to have gone completely over the heads of the dorks running their mouths below that what Jeremy Corbyn said bombing Syria would produce - it did produce on Saturday in Leytonstone (and in San Bernardino too) Although you would never know it because MSM both sides of the Atlantic are playing these incidents down (diametrically opposite to the way they played UP the Paris attack - because that one served the US narrative) <br/>Already today,  the US thugs have bombed a Syrian Army camp (or perhaps it was the RAF because the US are denying it of course) In either event,  it is clear that the mandate remains the same, 'get rid of Assad' and make a deal with IS <br/>It should now be clear to all,  that the US would make deal with Satan if he would do as they demand.<br/>BTW has everyone forgotten that Russia are in Syria (in force) ?  <br/>I have a feeling they will remind America and Britain pretty soon</p>

<p>When are you off to fight for the caliphate comrade?</p>

<p>""Already today, the US thugs have bombed a Syrian Army camp (or perhaps it was the RAF because the US are denying it of course)""</p>

<p>Good; hope the bombs were on target.</p>

<p>""In either event, it is clear that the mandate remains the same, 'get rid of Assad' and make a deal with IS""</p>

<p>Actually, the West rather wants shot of both. It's Russia that's being a tad selective about which murderers she bombs and which she backs.</p>

<p>""BTW has everyone forgotten that Russia are in Syria (in force) ? <br/>I have a feeling they will remind America and Britain pretty soon""</p>

<p>Ooooh! Frightening! But in reality I suspect the denouement will be Vlad handing us Assad's head on a platter as part of a compromise Western/Russian accommodation on Syria and maybe wider issues of contention too.  </p>

<p>So, to clarify, in a world where 'Chris' were President...<br/>1) we wouldn't intervene anywhere in the world regardless of how many men, women and children are slaughtered because we are concerned about what one lunatic might do 'in the name of Islam'...<br/>2) The mainstream media is apparently playing down comments made by the Leader of the Opposition, by giving the debate wall-to-wall coverage and giving roughly 1/3 of the after-the-event coverage to him (the other 1/3 to Hilary Benn and the Prime Minister) - seems perfectly fair to me considering the share of the votes afterwards.  Before the vote you couldn't get away from Corbyn-this and Corbyn-that.<br/>3) Have British bombing raids killed 130 truly innocent (as opposed to claiming to be innocent) people yet?  Perhaps 'perspective' is truly in the eye of the beholder?<br/>4) You claim that the US bombed a Syrian Army camp, but you don't know for sure, and it could be the British (or, conceivably, it may not have happened at all).  This is far from "clear", is it Chris?<br/>5) I don't think it's any more clear to me who the US would do a deal with.  Doubtless you have lots of other 'evidence' you are dying to share.<br/>6) I think with the amount of coverage given to democratic debate in the House of Commons, and how many times Russia was mentioned, I don't think "everyone [has] forgotten", and I wonder, therefore, what point, if any, you are making?<br/>You've proved yourself a bit of a muppet with your post, haven't you?  After the eloquence of Corbyn (yes, I give him due credit), Benn, and Cameron, you are perhaps a reminder that there are indeed millions of people in this Country who don't think before they speak/pen/type a reaction.</p>

<p>To clarify to the codfather on behalf of Chris (if he agrees I don't know):<br/>1) We don't interfere where men women children are being slaughtered unless there's something in it for us (ie oil). Viz; China, Tibet, Somalia, N Korea and all the other no-shows etc.<br/>2) Corbyns comments are rubbished in the media (as per Farage before). Must be a threat.<br/>3) Who are we bombing? It's not yet clear. Cameron wanted to bomb Assad a while ago and now he wants to bomb ISIS which is a US/Turkish lovechild.<br/>4) We don't know much about who or what is bombed. In this paper yesterday two articles; one showing the "Russians bombed humanitarian convey" and the other shows "Russian attack on oil tankers". Only one can be right (same scene illustration). Yes, it's all made up our news especially here in the DT (read about Con Coughlin and how he "informs" us - and he lost a court of law more than once)<br/>5) the US will deal with anyone until they get bitten (Mujahadeen aka Taliban). They're clueless.<br/>6) Russia has been invited to Syria by the government. The US and we haven't. It will probably end in tragedy.</p>

<p>To dispel this manure then</p>

<p>1) We interfere where our interests dictate it, yes, as all states have throughout history. Yet unlike all others, Western countries have also been known to make altruistic interventions too. Furthermore, irrespective of why we interfere, those we oppose are invariably amongst the most barbaric and oppressive of regimes or tyrants. In short, states' actions are maybe better judged with an access of objective realism as opposed to by invoking utopian notions of exclusively 'ethical' foreign policies with an excess of self-righteous piety.</p>

<p>2) Corbyn's rubbish is rubbished because it's rubbish; and mealy mouthed, disingenuous rubbish from a bigoted ideology-drunk clown to boot!</p>

<p>3) We're bombing ISIL, unlike Russia's bombing of anything opposed to her murderous stooge, Assad; Western-supported groups included. However, if that continues I wouldn't be surprised if we do bomb pro-Assad formations too until Russia gets the message. Which I suspect won't take long.</p>

<p>4) Our news is not made up; except the toytown sort that appears in far right/left loony outlets and reads like a parody of 1930s Soviet five-year-plan-production-stats announcements. The route to which you refer is often covered by a lengthy series of intermixed vehicles and so oil tankers and trucks carrying humanitarian aid may easily both have been present.</p>

<p>5) In truth the US are no more clueless than anyone else although it pleases smug, stupid and blindly antagonistic leftist dolts to pretend so because they hate America in particular as the most powerful Western state.</p>

<p>6) Russia has been invited by a regime led by a UN - indicted war criminal. It has no legitimacy and is in any case a murderous and oppressive dictatorship that is responsible for more Syrian deaths than ISIL itself. The fact that you make wholly unimpressive legalistic figleaf distinctions of this kind on its and Russia's behalf suggests only that like most leftist bigots you'll back anything anti-Western, however repulsive, iaw the dictates of the putrid dogma you espouse. Thereby exposing your affectation of humanitarian concern as nothing more than a hollow, hypocritical sham</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back in the real world; since the US and the UK's "humanitarian" interventions (which involves bombing people) Afghanistan is still controlled by the Taliban and Iraq and Libya have dissolved into chaos.</p>

<p>Yes, the news here is made up.</p>

<p>Look up Con Coughlin and find where he gets the news and how he lost his court cases because of doing it.</p>

<p>Look yesterday in the DT. "Russians bomb humanitarian aid convoy" (see picture of burnt out oil tanker). Another article the same day, "shock of Russian attack on oil tankers" (same burnt out tanker photo). One of the articles is made up.</p>

<p>""Meanwhile, back in the real world;""</p>

<p>When did you get here? You must visit more often.</p>

<p>Anyway I hope there are no more people lurking in tube stations looking to cut our throats . Well done again the liblabCON.</p>

<p>Stun guns seem  pretty effective ;)</p>

<p>But, but... think of all the wonderful diversity!</p>

<p>If Washington and Westminster had not funded, armed and trained ISIS in Syria to topple Assad in the first instance there would be no need for a anti-war campaign regarding Syria.</p>

<p>If Corbyn attends this STW dinner then the Tories will walk the next GE no matter whether labour get rid of Corbyn or not.<br/>It's a campaign managers wet dream for the opposition party to be seen to be cavorting with the STW brigade. I'm sure there are a lot of very naive people who are members of STW who believe in a world without war but there are many "friends" and hard-left members who have very different motives for stopping certain actions.<br/>A world without war is a world without human beings on it, that's just the way it is and the way it always will be.</p>

<p>You're confusing emotion with facts. A possibly catastrophic mistake when dealing with cults like Corbyn, whose followers have a messiah complex</p>

<p>I thought you'd made a typo but "followers" gave me the context.</p>

<p>Yes, but happily there is absolutely no possibility of a Labour government returning in our lifetime.</p>

<p>That, thank goodness is long over.</p>

<p>'but happily there is absolutely no possibility of a Labour government returning in our lifetime'; I wish I shared your confidence.</p>

<p>Not enough muslims........... at the moment..</p>

<p>I. to the immense chagrin of many here, was one of the very few to have predicted a six seat majority to the Tories in the recent general election.</p>

<p>It was not guesswork but data projection with some adjustments.</p>

<p>You may rest peacefully in your bed - Labour will not be coming back, probably ever.</p>

<p>Wow; I'm impressed.</p>

<p>Much as I hate the Labour party I see no benefit in it becoming extinct just so the Conservatives can become the party of jihadists, mass immigration and big government.</p>

<p>The pull of 'something for nothing', 'buy now pay later', support 'good' causes and charities to assuage guilty consciences, should not be underestimated. Labour have been successful on this basis, with the Tories labelled 'uncaring' and 'out of touch'. There is no evidence to support the view that feelings about the Tories have changed or will change. All it takes is for Labour to dump Corbyn and get in a charismatic individual as the Tories don't have any and they will certainly win again</p>

<p>Such blatant attempts to smear the politically engaged public are straight from the gutter.</p>

<p>Its exactly like shouting racist when a member of the "politically engaged public" questions immigration......... is it not?</p>

<p>Heh! When he reads that, Porky's features will shift spontaneously into the classic default "left bigot self-righteous disapproval" mode, making his face resemble the back end of a cat.</p>

<p>"These are people who would rather take sides with Putin, or Hamas and IRA terrorists than with any democratic government"</p>

<p>I think we've got to the point where the majority of people in Britain would trust Putin over our government. It shows how low our politicians have sunk.<br/>Rather than trying to compare peace campaigners to Isil perhaps they would care to rebuild public trust by telling the truth? Or, better still, resign so we can have some patriotic and honest representatives again.</p>

<p>`so we can have some patriotic and honest representatives again.'</p>

<p>Are there some around?</p>

<p>None spring to mind. We're looking for life experience, courage, wisdom and effectiveness, honed in adverse circumstances. The 2nd WW helped shape politics in the aftermath, with many gaining valuable experience. Now we've got their idiot children who play at politics whilst the country burns</p>

<p>lol, this country is not burning....what a bizarre thing to say.</p>

<p>ok - call it a 'slow burn', as I do.  A slow deterioration in UK PLC.</p>

<p>Not where you are, the rest is burning with resentment</p>

<p>Stop Some Wars Coalition, happy to support some wars, anything against Britain fine, any thing against the Ukraine absolutely and any war against Israel, that is the stuff of their wet dreams.</p>

<p>Indeed - they only want to stop our side of the war anyway. There's no STWC protests against terrorist HQs in Iraq, Syria or Tower Hamlets.</p>

<p>Stop The War Coalition is as disgusting and should be held in the same contempt as Unite Against Fascism. Both of them use a reputable name to make them sound like they rally behind noble causes, but the reality is distorted as those who fight their cause will stoop as low as they can in a perverse view that the means justifies their aims.</p>

<p>Both misnomers then - a bit like the 'Labour' Party, that couldn't give a monkeys about working people.</p>

<p>Stop the War is just a front for a mishmash of Islamists, anarchists, Trotskyists, West haters, misfits, antisemites and conspiracy theorists. A bit like the Green Party.</p>

<p>Surely you're not talking about the peace loving warriors of freedom and justice who occasionally cloak themselves in the Christian tradition of love and peace for effect, whilst letting those who wish to maim and kill go unpunished?</p>

<p>Half-educated self-loathing failures who hate and envy anyone who is not.</p>

<p>I know - dreadful people.</p>

<p>"Critics say the group is viciously anti-West."</p>

<p>More manufactured DT nonsense.</p>

<p>Interventions in Iraq and Libya have been disasterous. This will be too. For heaven's sake, Cameron has changed his mind about whom he wishes to bomb!  (I'm being polite saying "his mind", as he's being told what to do)</p>

<p>lol! what a bizarre comment, I guess in your mind we should still be bombing the germans having decided to do that 80 years ago</p>

<p>As long as they are wannabe jihadis,it doesn't really matter who we bomb</p>

<p>Yes, of course you're all for violence...</p>

<p>I do hope the rights of the guy that knifed a couple of people at Leytonstone station will be respected. Just because he decided to try &amp; behead a couple of Englishmen is no reason for his extended family to be barred from coming here &amp; living off out taxes indefinitely. I hope our Human Rights aware judges act responsibly on these matters</p>

<p>So of course you oppose basic rights (for everyone) based on that incident, right. No need to judges, courts, etc.</p>

<p>I was perturbed that one of the policemen at Leytonstone Station addressed the gentleman with the words, "Drop the knife, you fool". That is plain disrespectful. I trust the policeman will be disciplined and sent to "diversity training".</p>

<p>Quite, we would not want a misunderstood minority to be, erm...misunderstood.</p>

<p>Corbyn, McDonnell, STW, Momentum etc etc<br/>All they ever want to do is tax us workers to the brink of poverty so that they can walk the streets chucking money at people like they are the new messaih's.<br/>They are the Internet socialist media mob that spin tales about mass conspiracies, they watch Al Jazeera like it's the holy grail of news, they have a self-righteous image of themselves bathed in protest and dream of standing on soap boxes shouting into megaphones as an adoring crowd cheers their every word.<br/>The see Da'esh, the IRA, Hamas and hezbollah as freedom fighters, laying down their lives for their beliefs whilst at the same time pouring scorn on our own armed forces and their sacrifices.<br/>One thing is for sure, if we lived in a world formed by STW/Corbyn/McDonnell policies and politics then we would be a subservient society, watching on as the world burns around us, surrendering our freedoms for the illusion of peace.<br/>No thanks, I choose a capitalist democracy for all it's grotesqueness it is better than appeasement and collaboration.</p>

<p>Don't you know that Champagne socialists, ie the present set, look after themselves and their cronies first and foremost? Next, pay lip service to 'socialist' ideas of 'solidarity', feminism, poverty, injustice, racism, etc etc</p>

<p>`All they ever want to do is tax us workers to the brink of poverty so that they can walk the streets chucking money at people like they are the new messaih's.'</p>

<p>Actually, they have an alarming tendency to keep the money for themselves.</p>

<p>A 'rigged' question. Here is a fairer one. Which group has caused the most deaths in the Middle East: STW, ISIS, or the supporters of the illegal invasion of Iraq?</p>

<p>You've missed out the correct answer - "the people of the Middle East".</p>

<p>Well, if we say that the STWC 'got its way' in September 2013 with the vote on Syria after Ghouta, then it and all its supporters are effectively responsible for the thousands of civilian deaths in Syria and Iraq, the rise of ISIL, and the refugee crisis that we're dealing with.</p>

<p>So they'd be up their in the league table with ISIL and Assad. </p>

<p>You'd love it to be 'the supporters of the illegal invasion of Iraq', wouldn't you??</p>

<p>ISIS and their friends have caused the most death. The vast majority of those who have died in Iraq in the past 12 years have died at the hands of Sunni jihadist terrorists.</p>

<p>Simply put on one side are the Obamas, Camerons, Hollandes and others of this world who believe in nothing but their own sense of self-worth and entitlement. On the other side is Isis who (whatever you might think of them) do really believe they are fighting for an Islamic world and what they do is justified by their holy book and the example of Mohammed. They believe in something bigger than themselves. The world is not all about them and their immediate gratification.</p>

<p>So the war reduces to an Xbox war on one side and a real war on the other. The Xbox war is prosecuted by the frightened and weak and the real war by those who are prepared to fight for real no matter how ugly it gets. The weak rely on the massive military advantages conferred by science and engineering without having even the slightest understanding of any of it and its limitations. They hide behind it out of fear and conduct war by remote in the form of recreational bombing. The other side stand on the field of battle and cop their losses and because that is where they stand at the end of the day they win.</p>

<p>You see, Isis don't live in an Xbox so an Xbox war game won't bring them unstuck no matter how clean it looks or how much these so called leaders wish it so. You don't have to like Isis but they are fighting a real war and are prepared to get down and very dirty. That is why they are winning and winning they are despite the ups and downs and vagaries of the gods of war. Isis are stronger this year than last year and last year were stronger than the year before. Paris lives under martial law because of Isis and requires an army on the streets to try to keep a lid on it. Isis could never have achieved that two years ago but now they can. And guess what? They are coming to a place near you soon. Get use to it.</p>

<p>Mr Hitler was quite confident for quite a long time as were all the countless other appalling despots who thankfully are now dead</p>

<p>Can't wait to live under a strict Sharia law, eh?</p>

<p>You sound like you are really pleased about that. I hope that you get a knock on the door soon.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. I am not pleased about it and I am not an apologist for or supporter of Islam. It is useless to expatiate on the evils and horrors Islam has visited on the world in the last 1400 years and these last few decades are just a continuation of that. It is just what it is.</p>

<p>'Just what it is'. The epitaph of an apologist for terror and murder, rape, stoning of adulteres, homosexuals</p>

<p>Yeah that's right. Sit on the fence and wring your hands.....</p>

<p>Be clear.  STW does kill people.  Its weak attitude to those in society that will attack us for our lack of strength, gets people killed.  How many people will be volunteering to go out and raise money for these murderers if we hung them for sedition?  How many less terrorist groups do you think we would have had if the Britsh Army had been allowed to do their job and killed everyone of the vicious IRA murderers that STW head Corbyn parades around with?</p>

<p>Let;s be very very clear. Pandering to these sub-human pests is what gets us into the mess every time.  There would be no ISIS if we had commitment from weak world leaders to address this problem collectively. Instead we get mealy mouthed words.</p>

<p>Being weak gets people killed, on and on. Being strong might get people killed at the outset but it stops a disease being an epidemic.</p>

<p>The moment people see unfairness (assassination rather than using law) like murdering the IRA (however delightful that prospect) you draw more people into the cause.</p>

<p>We have run an Empire for 400 years and we didn't win it using the US method of bombing for democracy. We won it mostly by fairness and the consent of the people we ruled. We used to understand this but now we're ruled by the US we drop bombs to bring democracy which is about as anti-democratic as it gets.</p>

<p>Let's be clear these "sub-human pests" as you term them didn't ask for our interference. We did it to them first. Who created all this mess in the first place?</p>

<p>The British Empire was declared in 1857 and was constructively over by 1931 (Commonwealth declaration) or, at the latest, by 1947 (Indian independence),</p>

<p>So 74 or 90 years, not 400!</p>

<p>But it worked like an Empire for 400 years.</p>

<p>Britain didn't even exist poltically until 1707.</p>

<p>What was the extent of this empire in 1615?</p>

<p>Founding of Virginia</p>

<p>Ask India whether they thought it was 'fair'</p>

<p>It ended with very little acrimony and Britain brought benefits  such as democracy and education to a country which is by and large now grateful for it.</p>

<p>Compare India with Pakistan for instance.</p>

<p>"It ended with very little acrimony"</p>

<p>You're aware that India, Pakistan and Bangladesh were all just "India" under the empire, are you?</p>

<p>"Britain brought benefits such as democracy and education to a country"</p>

<p>It wasn't "a" country and it became three:</p>

<p><i>The newly formed governments were completely unequipped to deal with migrations of such staggering magnitude, and massive violence and slaughter occurred on both sides of the border. Estimates of the number of deaths vary, with low estimates at 200,000 and high estimates at 1,000,000.</i></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partition_of_India#Independence.2C_population_transfer.2C_and_violence" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p>

<p>It was another example of the English wheeze of  leaving a big pile of s--- whenever they are forced out (Ireland Palestine)</p>

<p>Yes, the French, Germans, Russians, Dutch, and Japanese did so much better.</p>

<p>That's why there's a German Commonwealth Games today in which Poland and Namibia compete with each other.</p>

<p>They have gone their separate ways.</p>

<p>The'y still didn't think it was 'fair'</p>

<p>In strict terms it wasn't but perhaps in this case the end really did justify the means.</p>

<p>Spoken like a true apologist for terror.</p>

<p>Absolutely anything but. I am defiantly on the side of the hawks.</p>

<p>Get them before they get me and show no mercy (for the avoidance of doubt).</p>

<p>Why was it needed? It wasn't needed. Nor was the removal of Ghaddafi. Libya, another country ruined by our interference.</p>

<p>Yep, ISIS ridden basket cases all of them.  Western intervention an unmitigated disaster. How anyone can claim otherwise is beyond me,</p>

<p>One of thickest comments I have ever read. </p>

<p>Lol. If you say so Des</p>

<p>Glad you've bought into the 'Des' drivel. I'd have been very disappointed if you were intelligent enough to realise that I'm not Catholic. Your intellect, or lack of it, is always consistent.</p>

<p>Careful sunshine. At this rate you are going to end up getting banned, like your other alias Casandra :) </p>

<p>You think he's me? You're a funny guy. Thick, but funny.</p>

<p>I see your 'anti-semitic' slur was removed. And rightly so. Its your standard false accusation - always handy when you have lost the argument and wish to close down debate. Wouldnt want people knowing the truth would you now? You hate the truth.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>There you go again making your false accusations. Careful, they will ban you like they did Cas. </p>

<p>Well there we have it, and is this a surprise?</p>

<p>Israel's security is foremost in the minds of anyone who would defend a nation against terrorism and attack by foreign powers.</p>

<p>i guess you , like STW, are ok with terrorism as long as it's directed at Israel and the West.</p>

<p>And America of course. They hate America too remember.</p>

<p>Corbyn's cretinous drones. Not a brain cell amongst them, and that is how they are selected.</p>

<p>Cor blimey, what propaganda websites are you reading? not everything on the Internet is true you know?</p>

<p>Hook line a sinkered, you literally believe anything that conforms to your own misguided view.</p>

<p>LOL! #Irony</p>

<p>I bet you watch Al Jazeera like it is the holy grail of news?</p>

<p>Sorry? What point are you making? Saddam Hussein did a wonderful job of controlling the sub human pests in his society.  I would have left him in the job.  We need more people like him running Arab nations. Not less.</p>

<p>STW doesnt want to stop war. It is a pro-islamic pressure group that thinks terrorism is ok as long its directed at the west and Israel. All it  wants is to stop us getting rid of vicious islamist pests.  Show no mercy to those who would show you none. </p>

<p>Freedom and Democracy come at a price whether you like it or not.</p>

<p>Being bombed by the US brings freedom. Like it did for the Vietnamese. Like the dicators introduced to South America with US arms and money.</p>

<p>All very "democratic". This has nothing to do with democracy at all. it's the US trying to extend its empire.</p>

<p>Alleged 'Freedom and Democracy' means getting more than 4m votes and 1 MP</p>

<p>Well that's what happens when a clown leads your party. If you get rid of the clown you might fare better.</p>

<p>56 seats for 1.5 million votes in Scotland bring a socialist paradise (lucky them). In England 4 million votes gets 1 MP.</p>

<p>Who pays for this wonderful "democracy"? We, the public pay the price as always, whether it be funding bankrupt banks or paying the tax that Starbucks, Apple, Google etc wont pay.</p>

<p>Meanwhile wages increases for MPs (can't afford to pay anyone else any more). Bank bonuses (despite state owned) pay as big as ever.</p>

<p>Democracy? What a joke.</p>

<p>Not my party, I didn't vote for them. Yet again assumptions without facts. Go to the bottom of the class where you belong.</p>

<p>If only we had them.  Last time i looked we cant call them what they are and they have a greater voice than the majority ever time.</p>

<p>what are you on about? are you not free to make your own life choices? do we not see democracy in action in parliament?<br/>I think you might need to open your eyes.</p>

<p>See propaganda in action reading this newspaper.</p>

<p>"Russians bomb humanitarian convoy" in one article. And another (showing same lorry and scene) "Russians blow up pil tankers"</p>

<p>Asa Bennett's that is you don't support the war you're a traitor etc. My a***.</p>

<p>You mean having to live with Cameron and Osborne. A price worth paying?</p>

<p>Those two may  not be the most lovable human beings but I am happy that they are encouraging a recovering economy after what we collectively had to go through with the country's worst ever (and that is indeed saying something)  government and borderline psychopathic prime minister.</p>

<p>The possibility of the dolt Corbyn, a drone-like half-educated sanctimonious, faux-Marxist, self-righteous, humourless slob as Prime Minister commanding a grotesque wrist dragging cretinous rabble?</p>

<p>I really don't think so.</p>

<p>Good description of the alternative. Still doesn't make the Bullingdon set attractive, just the less worst outcome</p>

<p>Well thank goodness I do not have to spend time with them though I do come in contact with Mr Cameron occasionally.</p>

<p>I am simply fairly content that for the time being at least they represent the safest way out of the financial and economic mire.</p>

<p>True, the amateur CND on the opposition benches would be a joke, save for the fact they have many middle class supporters who feel guilty for their relative wealth and want to 'contribute' to a 'fairer' society. I fear the Cons have understimated the strength of soft socialism there is out there. Not surprising as they are really liberals themselves, and agree with many of their daft ideas</p>

<p>Also true.</p>

<p>Cameron is a social democrat on the German model and that is why I resigned from the Conservative party nearly five years ago.</p>

<p>They are for the time being, however,  the least worst currently available..</p>

<p>Takes me back to Ted in the 1970's, basically his policies were collective and sociallly bureacratic, anti enterprise. He didn't have the b**s to take on vested interests either, did it though in spite and eventually with the miners and lost</p>

<p>The government of Edward Heath was the only Conservative regime since the war to hand the economy over to the succeeding Labour government in a worse shape than the one they inherited.</p>

<p>By comparison, every Labour government since the war, without exception, absolutely destroyed the economy.</p>

<p>Possibly the worst PM after Blair and Brown??</p>

<p>And after Jim Callahan.</p>

<p>Blair did  command international respect and  admiration. He was terrific on his feet. I travelled the world during my working life and it was very noticeable.</p>

<p>He is only hated by the Corbyn style loonies remember, and they are actually comparatively few in number although  they are noisy and vulgar.</p>

<p>If you believe that Blair is only hated by JC's apostles, you need to get out more.</p>

<p>Yes, that is the way it looks to me but the problem the loonies have is that they suffer their own special brand of collective `confirmation bias' caused by the fact that they never listen or talk to anyone who is not of their odious little grouping.</p>

<p>One only has to read the posts in Labour List to see this manifestation very clearly.</p>

<p>The loonies hate Blair but very few others care one way or another. They hate Thatcher too, and Israel, and the Jews and America and anything else which they see to be, successful or `rich' or powerful.</p>

<p>Pathetic little creeps all in all, as my wife rightly says.</p>

<p>He and his acolyte Brown, did preside over mass immigration, which has arguably, forever altered the UK. Something unachieved by unlucky Jim, though he was useless</p>

<p>It is a wonder to me why people vote for causes which always lose. Why don't they ever stop to wonder why?</p>

<p>Emotion vs reason. The never ending battle</p>

<p>The rationalisation of failure - the thing which the Labour left do best. At that they are world class  - but at nothing else</p>

<p>Such people always have to hunt in packs..</p>

<p>Fear and hatred are the best emotion for radicalisation as facts aren't necessary. Tactics usd to great effect by the master dictators of the 20th century, now emulated by religious fanatics who believe they have the 'answer' despite many learned rationalists struggling. Conviction and emotion, fear and hatred works best</p>

<p>But it never survives as in the USSR because it has to enslave its indigenous people and you can't do that for ever.</p>

<p>Corbyn's Labour party is becoming such a regime in microcosm.</p>

<p>But it goes on, as these emotions will take precedence over any reasoned debate, especially for the majority. The USSR now Russia, has a 'strong' man ie, Putin, as they want a leader who inspires fear and respect, sometimes hatred. This is not driven by any sort of logic.</p>

<p>My good friend calls it the `peasant mentality' which you can see clearly with the Corbyn followers,as with those who revere Putin.</p>

<p>Yes, they 'love' him as the messiah, a failed 66 yo no mark politician who's never done anything, but has groupies, and will lead them to the 'promised land' of 'milk and honey'. Destroy the evil fascist opponents and triumph. If that's not the success of emotion over reason, then tell me what is?</p>

<p>It is the interminable quest for the endless free lunch which never arrives.</p>

<p>The left's very own Greek tragedy.</p>

<p>You're wrong. The free lunch box has well and truly arrived</p>

<p>Compared to what? Labour HAHAHAHAHA!!!</p>

<p>Yes either shot or hung, your choice</p>

<p>What a great idea by the Conservative party to get Britain into the Syrian war by xmas.</p>

<p>They were already in by proxy</p>

<p>errr you might want to blame Da'esh/ISIS for that one</p>

<p>Or we might blame Blair for the Iraq and Afghan wars and Cameron for wrecking Libya. Blair wrecking Kosovo which used to be run by the Serbs. Everyone is leaving now.</p>

<p>Goody... More refugees thanks to these idiots.</p>

<p>Parts of the Middle East have been at intermittently war with us since before the modern West even existed, before Britain or even England formed as nations.  This blows apart your argument that it would all be peace and love if we hadn't gone to Iraq/supported the Saudis/enforced the UN mandate in Palestine after WW2/whatever. The trouble is you're too lazy or bigoted to read a history book.</p>

<p>Unlike us, of course where we lived in peace and calm with all our neighbours... Yes, read history.</p>

<p>You appear to be replying to what you think I said rather than what I actually said.</p>

<p>I wonder why you loonies are in the infinitesimally tiny minority in the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Is it because you are collectively eye wateringly childish, naive and stupid?</p>

<p>The possibility seems to be there.</p>

<p>The key thing is to find out what Farage thinks and then think the precise opposite. This ensures you're always right.</p>

<p>If you're a communist</p>

<p>He has said a few things about the EU which seem to me to be about right.</p>

<p>It's not that infinitesimal.  They have the Muslim vote sewn up and the stupidest 20% of the rest of the UK. Enough to destroy the Labour Party as a Parliamentary force and further their objective of ending democracy.</p>

<p>That is undoubtedly true.</p>

<p>The slavish idiocy of the cretins who drag their collective wrists behind the dolt Corbyn is bemusing and actually quite fascinating.</p>

<p>However, they represent a very tiny proportion of the electorate, not surprisingly, whom by comparison, by and large are reasonably intelligent and passably well educated.</p>

<p>You understimate the emotional pull of the 'messiah'. Cameron and his cronies do too</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>The fact that this is the best you can do rather makes my point better than I could.</p>

<p>The UK/USA axis of war.</p>

<p>your username just proves that noone should listen to whatever rubbish you post</p>

<p>Who is noone.</p>

<p>thank you for proving my point once again</p>

<p>'Stop the War', like CND, is founded on emotion not reason: Stop killing, stop torture, stop the innate cruelty of human nature, the greed, the violence etc. Can't be done. Sorry, that's the REAL world.</p>

<p>and just like CND they are interested in us being defenceless.</p>

<p>STW is just another branch of international communism.</p>

<p>Yes, however the 'ultra left', ie communists, marxists et al,  are OK, according to the media, the BBC etc, even when forming HM Opposition. What's  not acceptable, is the alleged  'far right', ie anything which challenges the cosy liberal left consensus</p>

<p>Does anyone know which war the STW activists are referring to?</p>

<p>They do not want to stop wars - they want their sides (whichever is fashionable, IRA, Hammas, Hezbollah, Da'esh) to win - or, at least, be unopposed.</p>

<p>If 'Stop the war' was anything other than a voice for ISIL and its <br/>sympathisers they would immediately go to Syria, and demand the warring <br/>factions there, 'Stop the War'. <br/>Obviously, they won't do that, because they are only interested in agitation here in the UK.</p>

<p>Clearly,<br/> Cameron was wrong to brand all anti bombing advocates terrorists, but <br/>he was focused on the main support team of terrorists who look at him <br/>across the dispatch box every day from the Labour benches.</p>

<p>It is more simple than that.</p>

<p>STW campaign here because they are free to do so, they do not campaign in Syria because ISIL would kill them.</p>

<p>I suggest we have a web campaign to raise funds for the STW leaders to travel to Syria, with as many of their followers as they can persuade to join them, so demonstrations can to be held in Raqqa.<br/>It would interesting to see how many 'willingly' got on the plane....it would be even more interesting to see how many made it back.</p>

<p>David Cameron says....</p>

<p>'The truth is if we are going to build that strong inclusive and vibrant society we need...... many more Muslim men and women at the top of British businesses , many more Muslim soldiers in the highest levels of command and of course more Muslims in our parliament so there is not just one Muslim in the cabinet and one in the shadow cabinet but British Muslims all across government in positions of leadership and authority."</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHqRtLeI_pE" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</a></p>

<p>Here are countries where Muslims are in total control of the government and have 100% representation in their respective 'parliaments'.</p>

<p>Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Turkey,</p>

<p>Now hands up all those reading this, who think those countries that represent the highest Muslim involvement possible, as Cameron would like to see it, are countries you would like to emulate?</p>

<p>You're missing the point. The idea is that the West would host democratic Islam, forgetting the hateful calls to violence therein, as in the Quran, and become civilised</p>

<p>Oh as in Oldham perhaps.. ?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fahrenheit211.net/2015/12/04/oldham-was-it-the-bent-muslim-postal-votes-that-won-it-for-labour/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fahrenheit211.net/2...</a></p>

<p>Another one..............Read it again</p>

<p>You have not read the Quoran, there is no allowance for democracy in Islam. It is Sharia or death.</p>

<p>But mostly death, to which they are quite partial.</p>

<p>You have totally missed my point</p>

<p>Possibly.</p>

<p>Certainly. My point was that Islam will NEVER become civilised</p>

<p>Apologies I did.</p>

<p>Did what? Misunderstand?</p>

<p>If your expressed point is written in an ambiguous way, it is possible to misinterpret your point, I am not alone clearly in reading it as sympathetic, to the idea Islam can become democratic. <br/>After 1400 years of none democratic development, any idea Islam will change in our lifetimes, or ever, is pure wishful thinking.</p>

<p>Agreed. My apologies. Perhaps nuances aren't the best means of communication</p>

<p>You're no Muslim Bruv.</p>

<p>This doesn't prove anything. The Devil can quote Scripture for his purposes! In other words, if ISIL/Islamic State says something sensible, and STW says the same thing, how are we to tell which is which? Similarly, if ISIL says something stupid, and so does STW, how can we tell who said it?</p>

<p><i>To be clear, there remains a very important difference between Isil and Stop the War. Isil kills people and STW does not.</i></p>

<p>Is that really a clear difference?    STW supports people who kill people, whereas ISIL is more honest and has the bravery to act itself? The views are the same, a hatred of western freedom and progress.</p>

<p>Totally agree. An apologist's view which seeks to deceive. We are peace lovers and want to Stop The War, but in doing so we allow those who wish to murder us to have free reign</p>

<p>Lol. Pure Orwellian propaganda. What are you going to tell us next? Freedom is slavery ? How about War is Peace ?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>The one thing that is my constant comfort is the knowledge that the loonies are always wrong - no exceptions.</p>

<p>Correct</p>

<p>The 'Stop the War Committee' knows a thing or two about double-think. And double-speak, for that matter.</p>

<p>Really? How?</p>
