<div class="body"><p> Obviously, Jeremy Corbyn won’t use those exact words. He will instead talk about solidarity. Comradeship. Collective endeavour. The struggle for peace and international justice. He may repeat his claim the Stop The War coalition “<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12036659/Jeremy-Corbyn-defends-his-links-with-Stop-the-War-despite-criticism-from-MPs.html" target="_blank">represents the very best in British political campaigning</a>”. But his message could not be clearer: “I don’t care what the voters think. I don’t care what my colleagues think. I don’t care what my party thinks. These are my real friends. And if you don’t like it, screw you.” </p><p> There’s part of me that would like to respect Jeremy Corbyn for this. The fact that he literally doesn’t care. Doesn’t care that he is honouring an organisation that claimed Paris had “<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/12036681/Who-said-it-Stop-the-War-Coalition-or-Isil.html" target="_blank">reaped the whirlwind</a>”. That compared the butchers of Isil with the members of the International Brigade. That justified blanket opposition to military intervention by stating that “Bin Laden, Hussein, Gaddafi, Assad or Isil are none of them Hitler”. </p><p> <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="348" id="player1" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8VZKwdrquLA?enablejsapi=1" width="620"> </iframe></p><p> Nor does he care that over the past week Stop The War has been condemned not just from the Right, but from the Left. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/12039333/Caroline-Lucas-resigns-from-Stop-the-War-after-finding-herself-unable-to-support-groups-recent-positions.html" target="_blank">Green Party leader Caroline Lucas’ resignation from the group</a> because she was unable to support their “recent positions”. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/stop-the-war-faces-a-coalition-of-critics" target="_blank">Peter Tatchell’s assertion</a> that “StWC has repeatedly refused to have anti-Assad Syrian democrats and left-wingers on its platforms at events where Syria is being discussed; whereas it has offered a platform to pro-Assad speakers”. The pleas of Labour MPs who joined him in voting against air strikes on Syria. All water off a duck’s back. </p><p> Tonight’s event has been billed by Stop The War as an opportunity “to thank Jeremy for his service as our Chair for four years”. But it isn’t, of course. In reality it’s an opportunity for Jeremy Corbyn to thank Stop The War for services rendered to Jeremy Corbyn. </p><p> Obviously those thanks are partly for the work the organisation did in helping him get elected Labour leader. As well as for the important work it continues to do delivering punishment beatings on his behalf to his political opponents. But Jeremy Corbyn owes Stop The War much more than that. </p><p> <iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" id="player2" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FQLKpY3NdeA?enablejsapi=1" width="560"></iframe></p><p> Stop The War provided Jeremy Corbyn with his intellectual and political “safe space” during his years in the wilderness. They were the cocoon that shielded him from the harsh realities of the world as it really was, not how he longed for it to be. When – after all the marching and all the protesting and all the campaigning – Tony Blair had the temerity to win the 2005 general election, it was Jeremy’s friends in Stop The War who told him not to worry, it was all a bad dream. When David Cameron had the equal temerity to win the 2015 general it was his friends in Stop The War who reassured him this was further proof of how the country was secretly yearning for a genuine, radical, Left-wing alternative. </p><p>
