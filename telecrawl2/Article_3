</div><p></p><p> Yet, from a perusal of media coverage of the “Scottish issue” in recent weeks, you could be forgiven for imagining that the right to call a second referendum is indeed the responsibility of the First Minister and the Scottish Government. “<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3457418/Nicola-Sturgeon-says-vote-leave-EU-certainly-trigger-new-independence-referendum-Scotland.html" target="_blank">Nicola Sturgeon says vote to leave EU will ‘almost certainly’ trigger a new independence referendum in Scotland</a>” was the first headline I came across after typing the First Minister’s name into Google. </p><p> The reasons behind such predictions have been well rehearsed. If Scots’ votes in favour of remaining in the EU on June 23 are outnumbered by English Leave votes, Scotland will in effect be dragged out of the EU against its wishes, thereby triggering demands for a rerun of 2014’s vote in order to allow a newly-independent Scotland to remain part of the Brussels club. </p><p> This argument is itself predicated on a falsehood, chiefly that during the interminable and unjustifiably long referendum campaign in Scotland, no-one was aware (a) that the general election due within eight months of polling might deliver another Conservative government; and (b) that said government would hold an In/Out EU referendum. On the contrary, it was a major argument wielded by nationalist politicians throughout the campaign that a No vote on September 18, 2014, might well lead to Scotland, along with the rest of the UK, being outside the EU. </p><p>

Having considered this and many other arguments in favour of independence, they delivered their verdict. They said No, and did so in the full knowledge of what that decision might mean in respect of Scotland’s long term future as a member of the European Union. </p><p> Now, it’s perfectly understandable that the media, particularly the Scottish media, will want to thrash this particular dead horse for all it’s worth between now and June 23 (and perhaps beyond). After all, when you’ve been reporting Scotland as the centre of the political universe since at least 2011, it’s a difficult habit to break. But my fellow Scots have an important lesson to learn between now and polling day in 120 days’ time: it’s not all about you, Scotland. </p><p>

</div><p></p><p> Our English, Welsh and Northern Irish compatriots have displayed a patience above and beyond what might be required of fellow citizens these last few years as a significant minority of Scots took to the airwaves and the doorsteps to explain their desire for a divorce from them. But such indulgence is past. Every vote cast on June 23, wherever you live in our United Kingdom, has exactly the same value. That’s as it should be. And non-Scots must cast their vote for either Leave or Remain without any consideration as to how Scots might or might not react to the outcome. </p><p> The First Minister says she wants the whole of the UK, particularly England, to vote to remain in the EU, and we should accept her at her word. Nevertheless there are many in her party who are rubbing their hands with glee in anticipation of the opportunity a Leave vote would create for independence supporters. And it may well be the case that after a Leave result, Scots’ unalloyed love and devotion for all EU institutions, their distress and anger at being deprived of the Common Fisheries and Agriculture policies, will trump their 300-year history of integration into the UK (though I doubt it). </p><p>

It has responded to every electoral reverse by offering ever more powers to its nemesis. No-one knows what would happen if the UK parties ever stood up to the SNP because it’s never happened before.

Well, gosh, however would we cope with that…? </p><p> Now that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12090061/Corbyns-Labour-is-now-an-irrelevant-cult.html" target="_blank">Labour has ruled itself out of governing at any time in the near (or indeed distant) future</a>, the task of trying to hold together the United Kingdom falls exclusively to the Conservative Party. Whether that task is to be attempted within or outside the EU, the Prime Minister’s only chance of success lies in wielding (or refusing to wield) the legislative powers he already has, not in apologising for having those powers in the first place. The alternative, the “strategy” of conceding time and again to the agenda of the secessionists, can be expected to have the same level of success it has produced in the past. </p><p>
