One council worker told LBC radio: “I saw things outside polling stations that would make your hair curl. </p><p> “There were people outside the polling stations who simply didn't know what they were doing there.” </p><p> One Conservative councillor oversaw the counting of one box of postal votes and found 29 were for Labour, six for Ukip, three for the Tories and one for the Liberal Democrats. </p><p> The Telegraph understands that complaints were filed with the police alleging electoral fraud at the general election in May and May last year’s European and local elections. </p><p> Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said that he had “evidence from an impeccable source that today's postal voting was bent”. Some 7,400 out of 27,700 votes cast were postal ballots. </p><p>

<p> Carolyn Wilkins, Acting Returning Officer, said: "Oldham Council has not received any formal complaints about allegations of postal voting irregularities in the Oldham West and Royton by election. </p>
<p> "This was the first election held in the country under Individual Electoral Registration (IER) and we had a high level of daily scrutiny and interest from all parties in our work. </p>
<p> "They will have seen that we have a robust system in place for adjudicating postal votes which includes comparing the signatures and dates of birth in the submitted postal vote application to those within the postal vote statements. </p>
<p> "Where those do not match, the postal vote is rejected and not included in the count. </p>
<p> "We take our duties in administering the voting and count process very seriously and if we receive any allegations of postal voting irregularities then we would be immediately reported these to the police so they can be fully investigated." </p>

<p> What would happen if the swing towards Labour seen in the seat of Oldham West this week was replicated across the nation in 2020? </p>
<p> Of course, the usual disclaimers apply; by-election results are very poor predictors of general elections, because every constituency is different; this is, as swingometer maestro Peter Snow would put it, "just a bit of fun". </p>
<p> But Labour is on a much better footing, potentially gaining 86 seats and being just eight seats short of a majority. </p>

<p> She told fellow Ukippers that "the voters have spoken" and that even without any irregularities in postal voting the "harsh reality" is that the party would still have lost. </p>
<p> In a Facebook post she warned: "So the voters have spoken and they’ve stuck with the status quo in Oldham. I must admit to being surprised at the result. We had an excellent candidate in John Bickley and the political wind was in our favour: an unprecedented migrant crisis; the Tories in disarray over tax credits; and the Labour party leadership in meltdown. </p>

<p> "As Nigel said on BBC Breakfast earlier, this result shows Labour is still ahead of us in the North of England, but UKIP is the only alternative and we must rise to the challenge of continuing to broadening our appeal and showing we’re a party for all Britons. </p>
<p> "As far as the postal vote issue is concerned, the harsh reality is that even without block postal voting we would still have lost in Oldham. But we made our manifesto commitment to scrapping the current postal voting system for good reason. It’s clearly open to widespread abuse. </p>

We’ve made huge gains here already, as we have with appealing more to women voters, so let’s keep going on this track; finish the job; and focus on what we can do to win next time, rather than risk just sounding like bad losers." </p>

<h3 class="was-h3" itemprop="liveBlogUpdate.headline">Tom Watson denies he wants to oust Jeremy Corbyn as leader amid fresh call for unity</h3>
<div itemprop="liveBlogUpdate.articleBody">
<p> Despite Labour's victory last night, niggling questions about Jeremy Corbyn's leadership remain, albeit his future looks a lot more secure than it did 24 hours ago. </p>
<p> Deputy leader Tom Watson, asked by Radio 4 whether he wanted the top job, he said: "I never, ever, ever want to be leader of the Labour Party. I am very, very happy as deputy. I am enjoying my friendship and comradeship with Jeremy. We sometimes disagree with each other but that's politics. I am his deputy leader and I will defend him to the last." </p>
<p> <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Tom Watson calls them 'awesome', but who are Drenge?" height="387" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02608/tom-watson-2_2608964b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Tom Watson</span><span class="credit">  Photo: Jay Williams for the Telegraph</span></span></span></span></p>
<p> Mr Watson played down suggestions that the Momentum group was seeking to intimidate MPs who were critical of Mr Corbyn. </p>
<p> "They look like a bit of a rabble to me, but I don't think they are a problem for the Labour Party," he said. "I don't think they are effective. I think they are a bit of an irrelevance in the debate." </p>
<p> Responding to Ken Livingstone's suggestion that he would back moves to deselect MPs who voted for war, Mr Watson said: "I'm not entirely sure his words are helping the Labour Party. As the nearest we have to a Labour elder - he is getting on a bit, Ken - he should probably know that this is the week when we should be trying to bring people back together, but he is entitled to his opinions." </p>
<p> <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Ken Livingstone" height="388" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02122/KENLIVINGSTONE_2122535b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Ken Livingstone, Labour's former Mayor of London</span><span class="credit">  Photo: PA</span></span></span></span></p>
<p> Mr Watson denied that the former London mayor was running Mr Corbyn's office, insisting he had never seen him there. </p>
<p> He said the party needed a code of conduct on social media to prevent the kinds of abuses some MPs have complained of at the time of the Syria vote. </p>
<p> "To use an issue of such importance to try to divide the Labour Party is reprehensible," said Mr Watson. "I have seen those TV images of what went on in (Walthamstow MP) Stella Creasy's constituency and I can only say if there were Labour Party members on that demonstration, intimidating staff members of an MP like that, then I think they should be removed from the party. </p>
<p> "It's simply unacceptable that people conduct themselves in that way." </p>

<p> The source said: "I understand that there was one tweet that may have overstepped the mark, I think some wrong information was given. </p>
<p> "But there’s no doubt – I’ve never seen in 25 years of being involved in politics where you get over 15 per cent of the total votes run in on the last day. That is very weird." </p>

<p> Mr Farage will bring up the issue when he holds a press conference in the constituency at 10am. </p>
<p> He announced this morning that he would be launching a formal complaint after he claimed that some batches of postal votes were "99 per cent" in Labour's favour and that "bundles" of votes were being delivered to polling stations yesterday. </p>
<p> He said: "That doesn't seem to be consistent with modern, liberal democracy." </p>
<p> A party insider added: "The questions about postal voting have been going on for a long time. </p>
<p> "Nobody is suggesting there’s been fraud here. We are not formally suggesting there has been any fraud, Labour has been very efficient. </p>
<p> "We deal with it, but we feel there should be reform and there have been plenty of cases. It’s just odd. The system is as it is, the Labour Party is a machine that’s very effectively using it. Good on them. </p>
<p> "But they’ve won anyhow, so let’s not get too het up on that." </p>
<p> A Labour source hit back: "We totally reject that claim. Mr Farage doesn’t seem to have any evidence to support his claim. </p>
<p> "We won the election in every community in the constituency with both postal voters and non-postal voters. </p>

<p> Asked by the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme if he believed the result meant Mr Corbyn had passed his first electoral test, he said: "No, not really. I very much take the view that this was a safe Labour seat." </p>

<p> Labour has comfortably won the Oldham and Royton by-election, in a result that will ease the pressure on Jeremy Corbyn, <strong>Laura Hughes </strong>reports. </p>
<p> Jim McMahon won the seat with 17,209 votes, with a majority of 10,835 and a turnout of 40 per cent. The lower turn out means Labour's majority increased from 34 to 39 per cent. </p>
<p> Mr McMahon had the task of matching the late Michael Meacher's substantial majority of 14,738, which the former MP secured in May's general election. </p>
<p> Ukip came second, with just 6,487 votes, despite the eurosceptic party focusing it's campaign on Mr Corbyn's failings and questions over his reaction to the Paris terror attacks. </p>
<p> Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, posted on twitter that he had "evidence from an impeccable source that today's postal voting was bent". </p>
<p> Speaking earlier, Mr Farage insisted the postal vote would secure the election for Labour and blamed a "particular block vote that is a very difficult demographic for Ukip." </p>
<p> He has said "serious questions need to be asked" about the "perverse" election result this morning. </p>
<p> Mr McMahon told the count in Oldham: “I am delighted to have been elected tonight. </p>

<p> Nigel Farage isn't too confident about the postal votes, Laura Hughes reports. </p>

<p> <i>"The reason it's close and the reason I can't be confident about the postal votes is because in this constituency there is a particular block vote that is a very difficult demographic for UKIP."</i> </p>
<p> <i>Asked on where he he was referring to Asians voters as this "block vote", he said: "I'm going to say nothing because otherwise you'll all scream at me."</i> </p>
<p> <i>He also insisted UKIP had: "Huge potential with the old Labour vote in the Midlands and the north.</i> </p>
<p> <i>"If we come out top tonight then I think the Labour dominoes will start to fall quite quickly across the north", he said. </i> </p>

<p> <i>Asa Bennett and Laurence Dodds analyse recent polling and what it could mean if Labour lost </i> </p>
<p> Jeremy Corbyn faces his first electoral test since becoming leader as voters go to the polls for the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/nigel-farage/12022787/Nigel-Farage-urges-Tory-voters-to-lend-him-their-vote-to-defeat-Labour-at-Oldham-by-election.html" target="_blank">Oldham West and Royton</a> by-election triggered by the death of much-loved Labour MP Michael Meacher. </p>
<p> Meacher won the seat in May with 14,000 more votes than Ukip's candidate – a majority which should be unassailable. But as Corbyn faces week after week of negative headlines, Labour insiders fear it could be dramatically slashed. </p>
<p> A private party poll last week <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12009844/Labour-support-at-ballot-box-could-be-halved-at-Oldham-by-election-polling-suggests.html" target="_blank">suggested it could drop by half</a>, while shadow chancellor John McDonnell this week seemed to be preparing <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12023806/Ukip-is-an-evil-force-John-McDonnell-says-as-Oldham-West-by-election-race-tightens.html" target="_blank">for a majority of less than 1,000</a>. </p>
<p> If that happened – of if, somehow, they lost the seat entirely – disgruntled Labour MPs who have so far stayed their hands might begin seriously thinking about a coup. </p>
<p> So how bad could it get? </p>

<p> First, a health warning. By-election results can offer signs of trouble ahead, but they are famously poor predictors of general election results. This is partly because the composition of the electorate is different, and partly because their special, one-off nature makes voters do unusual things. </p>
<p> So as any pollster worth her salt will tell you, you can't just take a by-election result and generalise it across the entire country. </p>
<p> However, given the Labour party leadership is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/12024146/Voters-support-bombing-Isil-in-Syria-much-more-than-Labour-would-have-you-think.html" target="_blank">currently touting online polls comprising a couple thousand of their supporters</a> as evidence of public opinion, we thought: why not do it anyway? </p>
<p> We consulted the political forecasting firm Electoral Calculus to generate some fantasy Oldham results, and then used their handy <a href="http://www.electoralcalculus.co.uk/userpoll.html" target="_blank">custom swing generator</a> to sketch out what would happen if these results were replicated on the national scale. </p>
<p> For instance, here's the implied result if Labour lost 25 per cent of its majority to Ukip. </p>

<p> The Conservatives increase their majority in Parliament from 12 to 102, with Labour losing a shocking 46 seats. </p>
<p> In real life, it's fairly unlikely that all the votes would pass to Ukip in this way. But it's impossible to predict where the votes <i>would </i>go without simply plucking a figure from thin air. So think of this as a thought experiment, a piece of political fantasy designed to probe the boundaries of just how bad things could get for the Labour party. </p>
<p> And make no mistake, this is <i>bad. </i>Oldham West has been a stalwart Labour seat since its creation, so losing even this much of their majority would give Labour an electoral bloody nose. </p>
<p> But it could be worse. So, so much worse. </p>
<p> Here's what happens if <i>half </i>Labour's majority goes to Ukip. Remember, this is the kind of drop in support <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12009844/Labour-support-at-ballot-box-could-be-halved-at-Oldham-by-election-polling-suggests.html" target="_blank">some polls are actually predicting</a>. </p>

<p> This is a disaster for Labour. It's Jeremy Corbyn's <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/battle-of-waterloo/11676475/The-Battle-of-Waterloo-as-it-happened-on-June-18-1815.html" target="_blank">equivalent of Waterloo</a> – only without the preceding ten years where he wins any battles at all. It's the party's worst vote share since 1918. </p>
<p> Such a national swing would be catastrophic, leaving the Conservatives with 394 MPs, which would easily dwarf Labour's 160-strong cohort. </p>
<p> So let's imagine what could happen if the swing to Ukip was so bad that Labour actually lost the seat. </p>

<p> If the last graph was Waterloo, this is War of the Worlds. Sure, Nigel Farage doesn't actually get to stomp around in a three-legged robot harvesting people's blood. But he does become the leader of Her Majesty's Opposition, consigning Labour to a minor role on par with the SNP. </p>
<p> Again, it's obviously unlikely that every single voter who deserted Labour instead fled to Ukip. But if we split the vote loss between Ukip and the Conservatives, things actually get worse for the Left: </p>

<p> Total Tory domination. But hey, at least Labour are bigger than Ukip – even though Ukip have received twice as many votes (an argument for PR?). </p>
<p> Like we said earlier, none of this will actually happen. We're having, as Peter Snow would say when playing with his swingometer, "<a href="https://www.ipsos-mori.com/newsevents/blogs/thepoliticswire/977/Predicting-2015-just-a-bit-of-fun.aspx" target="_blank">just a bit of fun</a>". The real picture will be much more complicated and probably somewhat milder. </p>
<p> But it does make clear just how big an earthquake it would be for Labour to lose votes in Oldham, let alone for them to lose the seat entirely. Even a much smaller tremor than any considered here would signal serious trouble ahead. </p>

<h3 class="was-h3" itemprop="liveBlogUpdate.headline">Michael Meacher's death sparked by-election</h3>
<div itemprop="liveBlogUpdate.articleBody">
<p> Today's Oldham West and Royton by-election was sparked by the death of veteran Labour MP Michael Meacher in October who held the seat with a 15,000-strong majority. </p>
<p> Meacher, who died aged 75, was a long-serving MP who shrugged off a reputation as a pernickety Left-winger to become a useful member of Tony Blair’s government. </p>
<p> Branded “<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10697120/Anthony-Neil-Wedgwood-Benn-obituary.html">Tony Benn</a>’s vicar on earth” by Neil Kinnock at the height of Labour’s internal strife, he managed for six years as environment minister to avoid most banana skins , before reverting to type as a critic of Blair’s policies. </p>
<p> <span class="ssImg left"><img alt="Michael Meacher in 2007" height="387" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03478/2669593_Labour_Lea_3478879b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Michael Meacher in 2007</span><span class="credit">  Photo: Justin Sutcliffe</span></span></span></span></p>
<p> In office he reinforced New Labour’s green credentials. He handled his portfolio shrewdly, save for the embarrassment of a “fridge mountain” after officials misjudged an EU directive on the disposal of appliances containing greenhouse gases. </p>
<p> When the controversy over “Frankenstein food” GM crops erupted in 1999, it was the Cabinet Office minister Jack Cunningham, in charge of “selling” the idea, who caught the flak. Meacher staked out a more wary position without breaking with government policy that trials of such crops were desirable. </p>
<p> While Meacher’s superior, John Prescott, Labour’s deputy prime minister, fell out with many ministers who served under him, there was little friction between him and Meacher. Prescott was not particularly interested in the environment, and the two co-existed – except when Prescott tried to elbow Meacher out of leading Britain’s delegation to a summit in Johannesburg, giving way when environmental groups protested. </p>
<p></p>
<p> <span class="ssImg left"><img alt="Michael Meacher in 1999 during his tenure as Environment Minister " height="515" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03478/667759_0430_ENVIRO_3478882e.jpg" version="e" width="300"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:300px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Michael Meacher in 1999 during his tenure as Environment Minister </span></span></span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p> The parsonical Meacher had incurred ridicule, and £80,000 in costs, in 1988 when he sued <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/politics-obituaries/7702097/Alan-Watkins.html">Alan Watkins</a> of the Observer for asserting that he had falsely claimed working-class origins. Watkins’s counsel claimed that the public school-educated Meacher depicted himself as a farm labourer’s son when his father was an accountant who had retired to the family holding. </p>
<p> Meacher in court described his origins as “modest”, but earlier he had said: “I am very conscious of my privileged background. My strongest motivation in politics is guilt.” After 12 days the jury agreed with Watkins. </p>
<p> Later acquiring a second home in the Cotswolds, Meacher angered neighbours by seeking to fell 20 trees to create a tennis court, then in 1999 earned an instant slap-down from Blair for saying second-home ownership might have to be curbed. Meacher’s comment cost him the chance to head a new Department of Rural Affairs – a job given two years later to Margaret Beckett. </p>
<p> Meacher left the government in 2003 to campaign against genetically modified foods and the global power of the United States, urging the Cabinet to “rise up” against Blair. When in 2007 Blair stood down, Meacher prepared to run against Gordon Brown, but stepped aside for John McDonnell – who had more support among Labour MPs (and is now shadow chancellor), but not enough to mount a challenge. </p>
<p></p>
<p> <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Michael Meacher along with Pendle MP Gordon Prentice lead out local ramblers onto Boulsworth Moor, West Yorkshire in 1997" height="387" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03478/1681224_Freedom_to_3478885b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Michael Meacher along with Pendle MP Gordon Prentice lead out local ramblers onto Boulsworth Moor, West Yorkshire in 1997</span><span class="credit">  Photo: Howard Barlow</span></span></span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p> Meacher’s gaffes and dalliances with the hard Left led some to write him off. They overlooked his pedigree as a junior minister under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan, his relatively sure handling of six portfolios over 14 years in the shadow cabinet, and his ability to get on with people. </p>
<p> Originally an academic, during the Thatcher years Meacher gained a reputation for tying Tory ministers in statistical knots. Nigel Lawson christened him “the thinking man's Des Wilson", a tag not complimentary to the garrulous leader of Shelter. </p>
<p> In office, he showed application and attention to detail. This was not always appreciated: as a junior trade minister in the 1970s he had upset officials by redrafting parliamentary answers to give them a Eurosceptic flavour. Meacher’s secretary of state, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1341502/Lord-Shore-of-Stepney.html">Peter Shore</a>, who shared his views on Europe, burned the midnight oil toning them down again. </p>
<p> Having entered politics a party moderate, by the time he worked with Shore he had established himself as a “Bennite”, having cut his ministerial teeth as one of Tony Benn’s lieutenants at the department of industry, promoting – to Harold Wilson’s alarm – greater public ownership and workers’ control. His allegiance to Benn remained strong and the two men co-sponsored a policy paper, Labour and Industry – the Next Steps (1975), which upset Wilson even more. Prior to the 1979 election, Meacher became founding chairman of the Labour Co-Ordinating Committee, an initially Bennite group campaigning for reflation, an end to private education and the transfer of the media to workers’ co-operatives. </p>
<p> Back in opposition Meacher joined Benn on the back benches, supporting his campaign to make Labour MPs “accountable” to local activists. When Callaghan resigned before the Left could push through its demand for the leader to be chosen by an electoral college, Meacher demanded that Labour MPs show activists their completed ballot papers. He sponsored Benn’s 1981 challenge to Denis Healey for the deputy leadership; during a dirty campaign which ended in Benn’s hair’s-breadth defeat, Meacher was never accused of foul play. </p>
<p> Meacher upset the leadership by urging that future Labour ministers be supplied with back-bench “progress-chasers” to hold them to their pledges; with Benn he opposed the sending of the Falklands task force, and he challenged the centrist Eric Varley for the party treasurership. </p>
<p> When Michael Foot resigned after the disastrous 1983 election, Meacher, with Benn’s machine behind him (Benn having lost his seat), went for the deputy leadership. At the height of a contest he had a chance of winning, Neil Kinnock destroyed his chances by telling Jilly Cooper: “People regard him as Benn’s vicar on earth. In reality he is kind, scholarly, innocuous … and weak as hell.” Roy Hattersley trounced Meacher by 67.2 per cent to 27.8. But he was elected to Labour’s national executive (NEC) and the Shadow Cabinet. </p>
<p> Meacher realised that the Bennite tide was ebbing and Labour’s only hope rested in unity under Kinnock. He backed the 1984-85 miners’ strike, but Arthur Scargill branded him a traitor for disowning violent pickets. He distanced himself further from the hard Left in voting to discipline Liverpool council’s Trotskyist deputy leader Derek Hatton, though not to expel him. He dropped out of Labour’s factional and leadership calculations when Robin Cook ousted him from the NEC in 1988 after his courtroom defeat . </p>
<p> Meacher’s Bennite period came to be viewed by some colleagues as an aberration or even a necessity for survival. Others were less forgiving and would have been unsurprised by his decision to throw his weight behind Jeremy Corbyn in the recent Labour leadership contest. </p>

<p> Michael Hugh Meacher was born in Hemel Hempstead on November 4 1939, the son of George Meacher, a third-generation tenant farmer briefly articled to an accountant, and Doris Foxell, whose family owned a grocers shop. He won a scholarship to Berkhamsted School and went on to New College Oxford, taking a First in Greats. His mother wanted him to enter the Church, and he never abandoned his faith. </p>
<p> Meacher became secretary to the Danilo Dolci Trust, then a research fellow at the University of Essex; in 1966 he contested Colchester. He lectured in Social Administration at the University of York, and from 1970 at LSE. </p>
<p> By then Meacher had lost a safe seat at a by-election. Defending a 7,572 majority at Oldham West, he should have been home and dry, but June 1968 was the Wilson government’s low point and the Conservatives took the seat. Meacher won it back in 1970, and would hold it for 45 years. </p>
<p> The three-day week ordered by Heath during the 1973-74 miners’ strike put Meacher on the political map. Armed with statistics, he floored Heath in the House by asserting that the economic damage would cost £3 billion more than giving in to the miners’ pay claim. Livid, Heath ordered a “maul Meacher” initiative; this assured him of a job when, weeks later, Labour found itself unexpectedly back in office. </p>
<p> After a year with Benn at the Department of Industry, an exasperated Wilson moved Benn to Energy and Meacher to Social Services under Barbara Castle. </p>
<p> He arrived at his new department in difficult circumstances. His expertise related to tackling poverty, yet Britain was experiencing rampant inflation with unions grabbing what they could and the poor being left behind. He personally donated £500 to research the causes of low pay, but had barely settled at the DHSS when Callaghan succeeded Wilson and sacked Mrs Castle, moving Meacher to Trade. </p>
<p> After Labour’s defeat in 1979 he became a visiting professor at Surrey University and a valued member of the Treasury Select Committee. In 1980 Meacher launched a campaign over deaths in police custody using the home secretary Willie Whitelaw’s disclosure of 274 such deaths in a decade to demand a public inquiry. His campaigning over unexplained injuries to James Kelly, found dead in a Merseyside police cell, led the Police Federation to accuse him of “unsubstantiated smears”. </p>
<p> As social services spokesman from 1983, his call to Labour members of health authorities to monitor colleagues’ voting records provoked the former MP Eric Moonman to quit the party, accusing Meacher of “Stalinism” – and triggered the Observer article that prompted his self-destructive libel suit. </p>
<p> Tory MPs voiced outrage at Meacher’s claim that Margaret Thatcher was telling the elderly to “drop dead” at Christmas. They calculated his spending pledges prior to the 1987 election at £7 billion, and exploited an attack by him on American “colonialism” just as Kinnock was trying to bury the defence issue. </p>
<p> Meacher nevertheless fought a good campaign, and was rewarded with the Employment brief . Kinnock in 1989 moved him back to Social Services, where he percipiently denounced plans for a Child Support Agency as “half-baked”. Succeeding Kinnock in 1992, John Smith moved Meacher to Overseas Development, where he highlighted the plight of refugees as war flared in former Yugoslavia and embarrassed ministers over the “arms to Iraq” scandal. But after opposing Smith’s drive to curb union block voting at party conferences he was shunted sideways to be spokesman on John Major’s Citizen’s Charter. </p>
<p> After Smith’s death in 1994, Meacher returned to the mainstream as shadow transport minister. Before he could extract full capital from the birth pangs of the privatised railways, Blair demoted him to employment spokesman under David Blunkett, then to spokesman on environmental protection. </p>

<p> During the Coalition, Meacher conducted a sustained campaign against the outsourcing of Work Capability Assessments on disabled people to the company Atos. In 2013 he so annoyed David Cameron that the prime minister accused him of taking “mind-altering substances”. </p>
<p> After the 2015 election, he was one of four MPs left from the intake of 1970, with Sir Gerald Kaufman – who became Father of the House – Dennis Skinner and Kenneth Clarke. </p>
<p> Michael Meacher married first, in 1962, Molly Reid (now Baroness Meacher); they had two sons and two daughters. The marriage was dissolved in 1987, and in 1988 he married, secondly, Lucianne Sawyer; she survives him with the children of the first marriage. </p>
