<p>Once we had a Sovereign with authority.<br/> Once we had public servants keeping the oaths they made.<br/> Once we had a thriving fishing industry.<br/> Once we had an efficient and productive farming industry.<br/> Once we had a thriving shipbuilding industry....<br/> Once we had an efficient coal industry.<br/> Once we owned our automotive industry.<br/> Once we owned our own iron and steel industry.<br/> Once we owned our own power industry.<br/> Once we had a brilliant aircraft industry in which we led the world. <br/> (Remember what happened to TSR2?)<br/> Once we had a tighter control of our borders and immigration.<br/> Once we were able to defend ourselves with our Armed Services.<br/> (They also had a very high morale)<br/> Once we had the best police force in the world.<br/> Once we had the finest health service in the world.<br/> Once we had the finest education system in the world with secondary, technical and grammar schools.<br/> Once we had free Universities.<br/> Once we had a great sense of National pride.<br/> Once we had an excellent railway system and public transport.<br/> Once we had an extremely efficient postal service. <br/> (You could send a letter in the morning and get a reply the same day!)<br/> Once we pioneered the civil nuclear industry.<br/> Once we had the best justice system in the world<br/> Once we had open courts and not secret ones.<br/> Once we had trial by jury at all times.<br/> Once we had freedom from double jeopardy.<br/> Once we had no hate or thought crimes.<br/> Once we had capital punishment.<br/> Once we had human rights that favoured only the victim.<br/> Once we had fewer regulations because common sense ruled.<br/> Once we had off-shore oil.<br/> Once we had full employment.<br/> Once we had houses that were affordable to first-time buyers on just one income.<br/> Once we had a religion that was respected by all even if not believed in<br/> Once we had a morality based on that religion.<br/> Once we had no ‘Common Purpose’.</p>

<p>Corbyn is a dream  - a passionate childlike dream - of a world where  we can run everything off the draught from a passing songbird, there is no war, and no need to defend against it, everybody is marvellously well educated at Eton and Oxford, and lives in an idyllic Islington pedestrian precinct munching organic food and cycling to their friends house for a tofu and green tea party. Where the new immigrants, who are perfectly nice well behaved middle class chaps, will sit down and accept that the culture which welcomes them is not one that they innately despise.</p>

<p>And that is what people support Corbyn for.. A romantic emotional statement about how they see themselves and how they think the world ought to be.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the world as it presents itself to our waking senses...</p>

<p>Labour's whole position on the EU is bound to be more than "...slightly contradictory...".  You can't claim to support working people but also be in favour of mass-immigration - the two are fundamentally incompatible.</p>

<p>Newly arrived immigrants will never be competing for jobs with the politicians, journalists and economists who tell us that immigration is a good thing. It will always be the ordinary worker who feels the effects of increased competition for work.</p>

<p>Corbyn isn't just irrelevant to the EU referendum, he's irrelevant to any state of affairs.</p>

<p>We must assume that Dan Hodges keeps discussing this man without qualities, in order to fulfil his weekly quota of nonsense.<br/></p>

<p>The option that a Brexit should choose is not Norway or Switzerland, but the Anglosphere option:</p>

<p>4.5 The ‘Anglosphere’</p>

<p>Some who advocate UK withdrawal envisage closer relations with other English-speaking countries, such as the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Others propose a much larger grouping to include India, Ireland, the Caribbean and the Pacific islands. For proponents such as James C Bennett,48 a US businessman and journalist, the defining characteristics of the ‘Anglosphere’ are the English language, Common Law, individualism, democracy, the rule of law and a strong civil society.49 Another proponent, British/American historian Robert Conquest,50 argues that democracy is very much an Anglo-Celtic invention and that its roots in Continental European societies are much weaker. ‘Anglospherists’ argue that the relative safety of the island of Great Britain allowed a culture of individualism and government by consent to develop.<br/><a href="http://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/RP13-42/RP13-42.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://researchbriefings.files...</a></p>

<p>Interesting you use the US as an example as somewhere with close cultural ties to the UK. In terms of employment law, company law and business ethics we're chalk and cheese. I worked for a US company for nearly 20 years and they do things rather differently over there. I don't see any natural level playing field where we could openly compete with one another. </p>

<p>As long as it was attacking UKIP the Labour Party was allowed to get away with equating the need to cut down on immigration with 'racism'  and even 'fascism' and many journalists went right along with this. Is it any wonder that it has got its knickers in a twist now that its traditional supporters are getting fed up with having 'our NHS' overwhelmed and finding that their wages are stuck because cheaper EU workers will be brought in by the employers [who love the EU, of course]?</p>

<p>Dan Hodges chooses this moment to point out the problem Labour has given itself by holding two incompatible views at the same time but because he himself is ardently pro-EU he wants to confine his blame to Corbyn. Well, you aren't fooling us, Hodges! Labour is riven far more deeply than the split between Corbyn and the rest. At the moment, Labour is enjoying [as they see it] the division in the Conservative Party but Brexit transcends party divisions. Labour can't rely on tribal loyalty any more than the Tories can. And, Dan, the case for Brexit is unanswerable except by aggravating people's fear of change. Be honest, do the right thing and stop peddling baloney.</p>

<p>Boris has put the BBC in a quandry, they cant start the usual "racist" bilge with their Eton toff.</p>

<p>We have two years to conclude an agreement with the EU if we invoke Article 50</p>

<p>1. Any Member State may decide to withdraw from the Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements.</p>

<p>2. A Member State which decides to withdraw shall notify the European Council of its intention. In the light of the guidelines provided by the European Council, the Union shall negotiate and conclude an agreement with that State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the Union. That agreement shall be negotiated in accordance with Article 218(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It shall be concluded on behalf of the Union by the Council, acting by a qualified majority, after obtaining the consent of the European Parliament.</p>

<p>3. The Treaties shall cease to apply to the State in question from the date of entry into force of the withdrawal agreement or, failing that, two years after the notification referred to in paragraph 2, unless the European Council, in agreement with the Member State concerned, unanimously decides to extend this period.</p>

<p>4. For the purposes of paragraphs 2 and 3, the member of the European Council or of the Council representing the withdrawing Member State shall not participate in the discussions of the European Council or Council or in decisions concerning it.</p>

<p>A qualified majority shall be defined in accordance with Article 238(3)(b) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</p>

<p>5. If a State which has withdrawn from the Union asks to rejoin, its request shall be subject to the procedure referred to in Article 49.</p>

<p>And remember, a referendum in the UK is not legally binding in any case, it's only a gauge of public opinion. So, although it's fanciful to suggest this will happen, the country could vote to Brexit, and the government choose to ignore it. Seems strange to me, but thems the rules...</p>

<p>Mr Corbyn is not just irrelevant to the EU debate. He and his party, doomed to decades of opposition, are now irrelevant to every single aspect of British political life.</p>

<p>Labour has generally supported the EU, just like the Conservative Party has<br/>been Eurosceptic. After all, it's the Conservative Party of Prime Minister David<br/>Cameron that has brought about the referendum which is now to be on<br/>June 23, and it's been Labour and it's government that has evaded the<br/>referendum, even for the Lisbon Treaty.</p>

<p>So, regardless of whatever Jeremy Corbyn said, the bulk of the pro-EU,<br/>pro-UK stay votes in the referendum would come from the Labour Party,<br/>a majority of whose voters are Europhiles by the virtue of its leadership,<br/>policies and, perhaps, manifestos.</p>

<p>The biggest dramatic development has been that of Boris Johnson's support<br/>of the Eurosceptic side. This would have more impact in making the<br/>referendum contests tough for both sides, and, even shifting the balance of<br/>support to the Eurosceptic side, according to contemporary poll trends<br/>and media reports. This is far influential than Corbyn's truncated declaration, against the backdrop of Dan Hodges' analysis in his article.</p>

<p>This referendum is a polarizing spectacle. Already, the prime minister is<br/>infuriated by Johnson's switch to Brexit activism and Euroscepticism.<br/>British business community is divided over benefits of British stay. But,<br/>the Confederation of British Industries or CBI sees opportunities for<br/>UK business in the EU market, which could undermined by Brexit <br/>prevailing in the referendum, according to a recent BBC program and <br/>debate early Monday morning. It's still going to be a close contest which <br/>will have more divisive impact on Tories, but unlikely to trigger any <br/>further, political schism.<br/>Igonikon Jack, USA</p>

<p>you clearly do not understand british politics or british affairs any more than i understand american affairs - which is to say hardly at all.</p>

<p>To: Dionysos<br/>I don't really have time for those who just drop (com)posts that<br/>have been rejected by overwhelming number of Telegraph<br/>Comment correspondents. If you don't understand American <br/>affairs that's your problem; not mine. But, don't baselessly<br/>generalize. I have done as much as I can in writing about trends <br/>in the U.S. 2016 presidential election here--trends some of <br/>which I have already expressed in the U.S. media.</p>

<p>At least, two bona fide TC correspondents have shared their <br/>views here. That's the way it's done. Also, many others<br/>have politely done so in previous commentaries. I have<br/>been around Daily Telegraph for a long time. I have written<br/>about so many issues.</p>

<p>Yes, like in writing there can be occasional mistakes. But, <br/>that does not reflect your shallow, jaundiced assessment.<br/>The bone fide replies keep coming. But, because of other<br/>commitments, sometimes, I'm unable to reply or do so soon<br/>enough. Of course, I don't know if I have read you or<br/>corresponded with you before--out of millions of members<br/>and readers who courteously and accordingly post here.<br/>Igonikon Jack, USA</p>

<p>It is very much your own affair that you choose to write about what concerns the British without any understanding of it. If the British don't understand your affairs it is completely irrelevant if they are not claiming they do, and better than the Americans themselves, and persistently writing nonsense about it as you do here. You should be thoroughly ashamed of yourself. Go away and comment on something you have some understanding of.</p>

<p>In your place, you should take adult education classes in writing or engage a private tutor for the purpose!</p>

<p>'But, because of other<br/>commitments, sometimes, I'm unable to reply or do so soon<br/>enough.'</p>

<p>Jack, every single poster here has commitments. You don't surely imagine commenting here is a full time job? Is somebody paying you for it as some sort of challenge?</p>

<p> By the way, when are you going to learn not to use 'but' to begin your sentences and even paragraphs?  </p>

<p>"Labour has generally supported the EU, just like the Conservative Party has<br/>been Eurosceptic."</p>

<p>More or less the other way round in general.  Most transfers of sovereignty to the EU have taken place under the Tories.</p>

<p>To: Max Principal<br/>Good comment. This is what will show up in the referendum <br/>debate. Anybody can find an issue to support his or her own<br/>side. But, the focus of the commentary was on bringing about<br/>the referendum denied by Labour, but pressed on by the<br/>Conservative Party, as a means of boosting the fortunes<br/>of Euroscepticism.<br/>Igonikon Jack, USA</p>

<p>It's also incorrect to say the bulk of the pro-EU vote will come from Labour voters. Plenty of Conservatives (like me) who are pro-EU and plenty of white working class traditional Labour voters who will certainly be voting to leave.</p>

<p>To: Petkula 73<br/>That's another interesting point you raised. A combination<br/>of forces on each side will go a long way in shaping the<br/>outcome of the referendum.<br/>Igonikon Jack, USA</p>

<p>Jack, the British in the UK have access to  first hand knowledge on their affairs and the general climate of opinion through talking to others and through the media.  You do not and only have secondhand information from the media, just like for Brits who are not in the USA or have close connections with it are experts on the presidential elections, so please refrain from pretending you do! Your commentary is more often than not  factually incorrect, irrelevant and of no interest as nobody has any trust in a single word you write. </p>

<p>"It’s a work of pure and evil genius to be able to say virtually nothing, but speak in such volumes."<br/>that accolade mr hodges goes to you. you are a past master at verbal diarrhea.</p>

<p>I suspect there is a strong pee smell in the Commons these days!</p>

<p>There was a time when the Unions &amp; the Left deeply opposed immigration. Of course, that was back in the early 1900's and the migrants were penniless Jews fleeing pogroms in Eastern Europe... so erm, no surprises there.</p>

<p>You can tell JC's heart just isn't in it.  He is instinctively anti-EU but is trapped into supporting it.  He has done the next best thing he can, damning the IN argument with faint praise.</p>

<p>"Those are my principles, and if you don't like them... well, I have others."</p>

<p>Groucho Corbyn, 2016</p>

<p>Wrong Marx.  Corbyn is more like... Harpo.</p>

<p>More like their more serious brother Karl...</p>

<p>seeing as corbyn is a bennite and eurosceptic despite his public proclamations to the contrary to please the blairites I thought he did okay. a wishy washy response is better than a rousing tub thumping in speech.</p>

<p>keep going jezza.</p>

<p>Then he is not being true to his principles!</p>

<p>which is probably why he is making a hash of it. the blairites forced him to say he was a remainian. they don't care about the EU either but they all want jobs there.</p>

<p>What wonderful leadership he's showing, eh? Railroaded in to supporting something he doesn't agree with by the PMP, who frankly wish he'd crawl back in to his hole and disappear. So what do we deduce? That he has no power? That he has no principles? Or both?</p>

<p>As I said a student mind in an adult body-<br/>He thinks with his "Liver" and not his brain-<br/>As I understand that emotion comes from the Liver.</p>

<p>It is not a legally binding international treaty and, despite what the prime minister has repeatedly said, it contains no provision for a formal notification to the UN. It is a fraudulent agreement specifically designed to fool the general public. It is a deception being made safe in the knowledge that most people will not be able to see through it, that much of the media will either be complicit in the lie or too lazy or distracted to properly report on it.  This is a stitch up, plain and simple.</p>

<p>To be clear; the decision is not being made by the European Council – an institution of the EU – but by the Heads of State or Government. They were meeting within the European Council but were not acting as the European Council. This was an intergovernmental forum acting outside the EU treaty framework. Even if it were the European Council the Council does not have any authority to make treaties.</p>

<p>The point to remember is that because this was not the decision of an EU institution it therefore has absolutely no status under EU law.<br/><a href="http://thescepticisle.com/blog-3/" rel="nofollow">http://thescepticisle.com/blog...</a></p>

<p>We the people, are all irrelevant to the EU, that's why very few like it.</p>

<p>I would have said it before about other politicians, because there has to be a record for everything, but Corbyn's speech yesterday was by far the worst effort I have ever seen or heard, or even read about.</p>

<p>Cringeworthy does not do it justice, neither does appalling or shocking.</p>

<p>It was simply disastrous.</p>

<p>But it was sweet and fitting .....Labour does indeed deserve Jezza</p>

<p>Oh, I don't know...</p>

<p>Dan, I used to like the way you would, in the dim past, occasionally respond to comments in your threads.</p>

<p>If you are still in the mood, would you please tell us who is responsible for deciding which of your blogs will be open to comment and which are blocked?</p>

<p>If it is you, then stop it. If it isn't, then tell 'them' to stop it.</p>

<p>This section is for comments, and that means us as much as you.</p>

<p>THE GREAT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES<br/>CnutCameroon wins the referendum 55% to 45%.<br/>Almost immediately the cnuts in Brussels start reneging on any deal they made (they can't help themselves it is what vermin do), at the same time Greece is force fed more austerity measures and Portugal goes into default.<br/>As if by mere co-incidence a huge 'backlog' of asylum seekers cross the Med in July August September dwarfing any previous migrant/invasion figures. The bbc shows pictures of starving babies. Corbyn demands and gets from comradecnutcameroon the decision to take in 50,000 to match the Netherlands.<br/>Reports from Sweden in the Daily Mail testify to a rape epidemic across that country where old lady pensioners are amongst the victims.<br/>And so a new party emerges from the ashes of UKIP and the eurosceptic wings of the Conservatives and Labour.<br/>2023 President Trump endorses the new English National Party government with its radical nationalist agenda of forced repatriations.</p>

<p>More than a grain of truth.</p>

<p>Sounds attractive</p>

<p>or at least better than what we're likely to get.</p>

<p>In my only bit of American: "Go figure!"</p>

<p>Poor Jezza struggling to read quickly through his lamentable script. Unable to think on his feet and faced by people who disagree with him and willing challenge him - 30 years of speaking to groups of like minded lemmings has not been the best preparation for party leader. Even Burnham was openly laughing at Corbyn's public ineptitude. What will this plonker be like on trident...oh dear.</p>

<p>This is what happens when the politics of the S U meets reality</p>

<p>Spot on.</p>

<p>Andy Burnham will be leaving politics to star as Captain Scarlet in the forthcoming movie of the Gerry Anderson classic TV show.</p>

<p>Judas Corbyn's strings will remain visible.</p>

<p>Way to effeminate for Captain Scarlet. More like a little boy lost crossed with a ventriloquist's dummy.</p>

<p>The eyebrows have it.</p>

<p>And his lovely long eyelashes(!) </p>

<p>I thought from the very start that Corbyns "gambit" of reading peoples letters at PMQs was mainly due to him being unable to think up six questions and remember them.</p>

<p>I own a pub, Corbyn's letters of the people ar no more than the ramblings of someone who's had 6 pints of lager.</p>

<p>"What has Cameron's EU deal done about my granny's hip operation being postponed last week due a sickness outbreak at the hospital ?"</p>

<p>You allow people like that into your pub?</p>

<p>Only if they're going to buy 6 pints of lager .......</p>

<p>If that chip on the shoulder continues to grow, Dan is going to end up looking like the elephant man.</p>

<p>"I asked PM what his EU deal has done to stop agencies using cheap labour to undercut British workers while exploiting migrants - no answer"<br/>Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

<p>Perhaps someone should tweet him the image of the Labour Candidate and the Tory Candidate, the one whose Company brings in cheap EU Labour from overseas, standing together holding a heart in Thanet during the GE.</p>

<p>What has our political system become? A den of liars and hypocrites.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed there, then - it has always been so.</p>

<p>A bit like Gordon Brown and the Damien McBride email scandal. 'I take full responsibility for this and that is why I am sacking the person responsible.'</p>

<p>Excellent Dan, excellent</p>

<p>Corbyn is an accidental leader. Opposition parties occasionally have them. The Tory party had one or two - Howard springs to mind. Despite the optimism of some on this thread that the Labour Party shall self-extinguish under such a woeful leader, I think that's a bit premature. He will be removed, quite possibly sooner than later and a meaningful and relevant opposition will be restored. As for Corbyn's contribution to the EU debate, Hodges is spot-on - few, including natural left-leaning thinkers, are paying any attention to his views, so effectively has he marginalised himself. Thank God. I would dearly like to see the case to remain in the EU argued intelligently and effectively outside - as well as inside - the Tory party. Incidentally, for those who see Boris as a champion for their cause, don't be so sure. Outside the south-east he is seen as something of a buffoon, a bankers friend (those ones who brought the UK to it's knees without EU help, remember?) and now a hypocritical turn-coat. There are more fools than Corbyn here.</p>

<p>Bit harsh on Michael Howard, given he'd been Home Secretary for four years prior to becoming Tory leader, as well as six years in the Shadow Cabinet. Corbyn had never held any position of power before being thrust in to the limelight. Unlike Michael Howard he's a rank amateur and completely out of his depth. In looks and charisma he's the supply teacher sent in to double geography with an unruly fourth form class. Hopeless, shambles of a man.</p>

<p>Boris is a career politician who is in it for himself. He is a Europhile, the same as Cameron, but is merely lining himself up to be leader once the referendum is over and we remain in EU.</p>

<p>The grass-roots Tories who predominantly favour Brexit, will give him their support when Dave resigns</p>

<p>Curious that you call him a "career politician" when he spent nearly 20 years as a journalist prior to being elected an MP. </p>

<p>He's the Mayor of London.  I used to be an Engineer, I now own a pub, no-one calls me "Engineer Dave" they call me "Pub Dave"</p>

<p>So by your rationale, anyone who is elected to any office is be default a career politician? Strange way to look at it.</p>

<p>I don't think that Johnson will have the numbers.</p>

<p>The Tory Leavers may welcome his attention-seeking and attention-grabbing as a means to raise awareness of the Leave campaign, but that does not equate to their support for him to be PM.</p>

<p>Johnson has just cut his own political throat, and will not be trusted within the Tory party, by the electorate at large, or by the EU and other countries.</p>

<p>Johnson is a shameless self-promoter - as intelligent and witty as he may be.</p>

<p>Intelligence &amp; wit are in short supply in Westminster though</p>

<p>Except that Boris was a journalist and still is.</p>

<p>David, Phil - agree on both counts</p>

<p>Not so sure Dave will resign - although much of Fleet St will have us believe otherwise, the vote will very likely be to remain. Fear and money are big incentives. Plus a vote just before the summer holidays and suddenly Europe got 20% more expensive..<br/>Once the excitement and screaming dies down the sobering thought of being poorer will make up voters minds.</p>

<p>In much the same way the Scots decided to stay in the UK, most people are living one week to the next and only really care about their own personal bubble, and the status quo.</p>

<p>Most families can't afford to risk a loss in income of even 1%</p>

<p>Yes, he's like the opposite of Judas Corbyn, except that grass roots Labour, traditional northern voters, all want us to Leave.</p>

<p>Quite a few people in the south-east of England though.</p>

<p>Every attack on Corbyn by your publication reinforces my view that he must be doing well/ From reading the article and various sports it appears Corbyn kept to the facts and his view of them. What he didn't do was play personality politics which appears to be required by our tired media. It was a refreshing performance following the narcissism displayed by Cameron, Jhnson, Farage, Gove, Galloway et al.</p>

<p>Seen any opinion polls or approval ratings recently? Labour have picked up virtually no ground since the disaster of the General Election. Corbyn's personal approval rating are through the floor and history shows us that leaders are never more popular than in the first 6-12 months in office. So given that Labour need to pick up something like 3 million votes to even get a sniff of winning the next election, whilst alienating their core voters and not really having any tangible policies or ideas, I'd say there's quite a lot to scoff at for the rest of us.</p>

<p>Did you listen to his speech in parliament yesterday - if not then trust me it was awful. I too was left with the impression that he was arguing that the EU was evil and the deal had nothing to address any of the evil and we should therefore remain.</p>

<p>"Every attack on Corbyn by your publication reinforces my view "</p>

<p>That is because you refuse to accept a reality beyond your own intransigence. There is a psychological term for it.</p>

<p>Yes, it was to the point. He doesn't play to the gallery (or TV) - refreshingly grown up IMO and that of the new recruits to the Labour movement who appreciate substance over style.</p>

<p>Mr. Cameron has had an education which demands total obedience and could be the reason the EU has become his comfort zone. He would have made a good guards officer as an alternative.</p>

<p>"Mr. Cameron has had an education which demands total obedience"?</p>

<p>To whom?</p>

<p>Evidence, please.</p>

<p>Is it true that Corbyn is a man of letters?  Or are they just e=mails?</p>

<p>I can think of four letters that describe him perfectly. Three consonants and a vowel.</p>

<p>Dan you are fast becoming a Polly Toynbee.. She is a long playing record of single tune that cannot be changed by the facts of life <br/>You are getting  predictable to read and  a one track  singer</p>

<p>Please find  objectivity</p>

<p>Lol odd comment. Why is it impossible for criticisms of corbyn be objective, have you ever seen or heard him?</p>

<p>I have only seen him on TV. I have read a lot about him.<br/> I have worked for about 15 years with his Islington supporters<br/> I am a Tory now retired.<br/> Dan just keeps playing the same tune<br/> He and Polly  should get married and bore each other to get in a haze of left wing idealism<br/>They will leave on a high</p>

<p>' Find objectivity? '  I would like to find some facts. I am severely tired of another persons point of view.<br/>The people of the UK would like to base their decision on facts. Not someone telling them how to think.</p>

<p>Sure but if they just say the same things what ever happens they are not thinking</p>

<p>Is there any grouping outside the Islington intellectuals who are natural Corbyn Labour voters?</p>

<p>Students.</p>

<p>Voters, not supporters. The polling stations close at 10pm which is too early for a lot of student types to be up and out of bed. </p>

<p>Yes - people who have read Marx, shout a lot,  and believe that they should be in charge and have lots of money, as well as  the power to send anyone they don't like  to a camp somewhere...</p>

<p>If Judas Corbyn had showed half the principles of IDS and stuck to his lifelong opposition to the EU, then yes. Everyone north of Stevenage.</p>

<p>Nope. And the brighter of 'the Islington intellectuals' (though that is really an oxymoron) are having second thoughts.</p>

<p>It is since they heard his devastating oratory.</p>

<p>I give you his 'devastating oratory'.</p>

<p>Think they may be disappearing fast......</p>

<p>We have heard so much about how unfettered immigration has been good for London from Mr. Corbyn.  The Conservative candidate for the Mayor supports coming out of the EU. I wonder what Mr. Hodges thinks his chances are?</p>

<p>Corbyn is spot on with his criticism of Camerons 'deal'<br/>Hodges, as you well know  the breakdown of workers rights embedded in law,  have contributed  to the rise  of zero hour contracts and a huge rise in temporary employment.<br/>Parallel to the destruction of 'rights' is the enormous rise in immigration that<br/> through lack of workers protection has a negative effect on wages.</p>

<p> In London alone, it is estimated that there are 600.000 people without valid work permits existing in the the 'black economy'.</p>

<p> Good news for employers not having to pay the min. wage, and health and<br/> safety conditions do not apply for people that do not exist.<br/>Good news for the crooks that can evade prosecution, the chance they face charges for slavery and tax evasion are minimal.</p>

<p>Bad news for people looking for 'real jobs' where they get paid at least <br/>the min. wage and have to compete with people willing to work a day,in <br/>some recorded cases for as little as a plate of chicken and chips.</p>

<p>Cameron's interests are with the wealthy who need London to keep its status as a <br/>financial capital where oligarchs and scoundrels can whisk away their money to off-shore tax havens.</p>

<p>Yes, the EU needs reform, a good start would be that what Corbyn envisions in this article.<br/>Cutting child allowance and benefits to immigrants solves very little but look <br/>good as 'sound-bites against the far right within the Tories and the UKIP, his reforms will not change immigration levels one iota.</p>

<p>Forcing employers to abide by the law would make it very difficult for <br/>immigrants that shouldn't be in the UK to stay, they would have to leave<br/> and finally go home to build up their own country.</p>

<p>Unscrupulous employers are  hiring  cheap day labour under the min.wage, with little chance of getting caught.<br/>Billions in revenue is denied the government because these 'crooks' are evading <br/>charges and of course their slaves 'pay in' nothing into he system.<br/>Corbyn is spot on that something must be done to combat constructions where <br/>companies using cheap labour can undercut wage agreements by employing <br/>foreign workers for work and pay them far lower wages equivalent to <br/>earnings in their home countries.</p>

<p>...all of which is happening while we are in the EU.  How will staying in change this?   <br/>Such things are the inevitable consequence of a surplus of unskilled labour.</p>

<p>"In London alone, it is estimated that there are 600.000 people without valid work permits existing in the the 'black economy'."</p>

<p>Who estimated that? Come on, don't be shy.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/20/this-is-london-by-ben-judah-review" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/boo...</a><br/>"Judah might not trust statistics but he weaves them into his narrative, and at the end – in case we don’t trust them – he gives the sources, mostly from government surveys. In 40 years the percentage of white British in London has fallen from 86% to 45%; 600,000 of those in London are there illegally;"</p>

<p>That is the source, but that claim has no reference to where the number came from - it is an assertion.</p>

<p>In any case, how would anyone know there were specifically 600,000, all of them "illegals"? Who would be counting them?</p>

<p>When you see a large, round number quoted, it is only an estimate and one which is rounded up or down to suit an argument, an agenda.</p>

<p>There are a lot of sites giving info on immigrants working without 'papers' as you well know, you are right that the figures quoted are 'estimates'</p>

<p>Judah gives in his book the sources - government surveys.<br/>to lengthy to handle that here, if you want more info you'll have to buy the book<br/>Give or take a few hundred thousand  migrants without documentation,  its obvious that a vibrant tax avoiding economy exists employing people in slave conditions.<br/>Yesterday watching t.v. I saw a migrant living in the jungle at Calais saying that he will stay in the jungle camp instead of moving to the newly constructed shelter because he will have to give finger prints and register.<br/>He was from Pakistan, and only wants to go to the UK.<br/>He knows he will find work and lodgings.</p>

<p>Employer who break the law do so regardless of UK's EU membership.</p>

<p>Yes scoundrels will still break the law regardless of the EU, unless labour laws are strictly enforced. <br/>Corbyn  suggests something must be done to combat constructions where companies using cheap labour can undercut wage agreements by employing foreign workers for work and pay them far lower wages equivalent to earnings in their home countries.<br/>On the European mainland its becoming a rarity to see trucks not manned by cheap east bloc drivers. These 'truckers' work for subsidiary companies registered in east bloc countries and have ousted thousands of truckers from employment because they work for east bloc wages.</p>

<p>I do wonder why Tony Blair encouraged cheap labour to this country......</p>

<p>Well it wasn't for the low paid postman, now being replaced by people on temporary contracts.</p>

<p> just look now where Blair is earning his millions., Follow the Money.</p>

<p>Socialsits eh!</p>

<p>Tatcherite to the core. Which is why Corbyn is seen asa death of fresh air, not perfect but at least there is a difference between Labour and Conservative.</p>

<p>"a death of fresh air" - brilliant.</p>

<p>Does a 'death of fresh air' refer to the stifling effect of Islington dogma?<br/>Out of the mouths of babes and predictive text.......???</p>

<p>Tony Blair, the well known socialist.</p>

<p>Blair was for privatisation, hardly a socialist , they named it Nu Labour.</p>

<p>JC really doesn't have much to say on the current EU debate. His thoughts on the EU were shaped in the 70s and in the intervening 46 years he hasn't given it much thought. Instinctively he is a leave, but he thinks 'I'm not bothered enough that I'd join the rabble that is the out brigade'. If he did and they won he thinks Britain would become even more neo-liberal rabid Tory world. He realises he has got no chance of capitalising from their win, he's too incompetent. What a sorry forlorn figure he cuts in this debate. Even worse are the vacuous PLP MPs they've undergone a mass lobotomy by the looks of it.</p>

<p>I think Corbyn has helped the Brexit side from a workingmens point of view.<br/>By damning Camerons lack of argument for Steel dumping, European immigration cheap labour , he has given all the reasons to vote OUT!<br/>Even though he says we should stay in.  You really could not make this up!</p>

<p>Yes , THE SUN will make headlines of this</p>

<p>You'll probably find that the approach is actually to install that view in people.</p>

<p>Then if we do leave Jeremy can throw up his hands, say "that's the will of the people" and then double down on the changes to the UK he can implement now that he's free of the neoliberal EU treaty.</p>

<p>What we all know is that he is still a "Student" in a elderly body!</p>

<p>"I need a cause"</p>

<p>Juda Corbyn ha been anti-EU all hi life. With 4 days of becoming party leader he U turned on 4 decades of opposition to the EU. Judas Corbyn wholly embraces the cornerstone of the neoliberal agenda he claims to oppose, Judas C loves immigration.</p>

<p>Corbyn does relate to the working man in any shape or form....thats why he helps brexit.</p>

<p>Judas Corbyn claims the housing crisis isn't caused the number of people needing somewhere to live.</p>

<p>Dan Hodges agrees with him.</p>

<p>Dishonesty is catching.</p>

<p>Why would 300,000 people a year cause an increase in demand for housing?<br/>Why dont developers build homes for all these people? After all the minimum wage has been increased.</p>

<p>It's not as if 4.5 million extra people moving here since 2004 means there's an extra 4.5 million people needing somewhere to live...</p>

<p>The Judas Corbyn / Hodges, head-in-the-sand logic is fun to apply anywhere. <br/>People being stabbed to death isn't due to people attacking others with knives, it's because everyone's not wearing stab-proof vests.</p>

<p>Even more disturbing is hundreds of young (aka underage) Anglo-Saxon white girls offering themselves up to paedophile immigrants from Pakistan.</p>

<p>And that has what to do with the EU? Worm</p>

<p>Labour is completely irrelevant, it is overwhelmingly Pro EU and Remain while much of its electorate is anti.  Those of the unemployed and working poor that will never vote Tory will switch to UKIP.</p>

<p>If the majority of Labour's electorate are anti and the majority of the Conservatives are as well - how come Leave aren't 20% ahead in every poll ?</p>

<p>I speak as an 'Leaver' just to be clear.</p>

<p>The various people who love such things say that those voting to remain are the wealthy, educated, management and student types, those described as leavers are the poor uneducated types, the same demographic as Labour voters.</p>

<p>Do not think that the Labour party has the readies to fight a campaign Hilary Benn virtually admitted as much on the Marr show so don't expect to much , my guess is that will not go down well and will expose Labour to an even worse result in the May local elections.</p>

<p>Of the parties, only the fungus that is UKIP are fighting for or against membership. Why would a party offering its MPs  freedom to campaign either way fund a campaign?</p>

<p>On the same program Benn declared the EU referendum was entirely due to internal Tory party squabbling. Tony Benn's son displaying open contempt for the vast majority of the UK population who want an end to mass immigration. Vile.</p>

<p>' vast majority of the UK population' maths not your strong point is it.</p>

<p>What are the true figures?</p>

<p>... and Tony Benn didn't agree with this EU experiment because it is not democratic....</p>

<p>Exactly.  Tony Benn's key question was "if you don't like what the rulers are doing can you vote them out?"</p>

<p>There was always going to be a backlash to this endless wrong thinking electorate that our political elites have to suffer. Just what the backlash will be is open to conjecture but history has shown us that when the plebs get taken for granted, overly taxed, called racists or bigots to cowe them from real concerns, made accept the unacceptable for long enough ... Unpleasantness happens. Possibly at the ballot box, sometimes at the winter palace, sometimes swinging from a lamppost.<br/>Corbyn and the labour party are going to learn the hard way that to buck the national will can and will be extremely terminal. Burn Through the fondness for labour in the working classes and labour becomes nothing more than the tiny liberal party wrapped in a red flag.</p>

<p>Judas 'less principled than Iain Duncan Smith' Corbyn does the likes of pathological liar Hilary Benn around though (granted, Jez should've sacked him) - Benn, who claims the referendum is entirely about "internal conflict within the Conservative party", displaying his utter contempt for the vast majority of the population who want an end to mass immigration.</p>

<p>Mindless rubbish, Phil. Sorry to be the one to break it to you.</p>

<p><br/>Did I write something that isn't true? (70+% want less immigration)</p>

<p>Did you write anything that is?</p>

<p>Got any facts to go with that?</p>

<p>Hodges, you should be more concerned that the Tories are in a shambolic state. Talk of the EU always exposes the dangerously rabid extreme-right that lurks in the Tory bowels.</p>

<p>They are the running dogs of the 1% who want deregulation so they can exploit the system and the rights and earning of the British people.</p>

<p>Twaddle.</p>

<p>Extreme right? Like Frank Field, and Tim Montgomerie, both committed to Brexit?</p>

<p>And if you are going to use the expression "running dogs" at least complete it "of capitalist imperialism" otherwise people will not know when to laugh.</p>

<p>Anyone NOT in favour of disbanding our military and police and security services, scrapping our defence systems, opening the borders to one and all, giving the national wage as benefits to the unemployed and providing missiles and nuclear weapons to Palestinian terrorists is a RIGHT WING NUTTER.</p>

<p>Extreme right............... only when you look from the exteme left comrade.</p>

<p>Hodges is fully aware but he is trying to drag attention away from the travails of Cameron and the Tory party. Dan Hodges days at the Telegraph are numbered.</p>

<p>On the contrary, he is going to be headlining here for years - he was the only one to get the GE result right and a reformed socialist now in the capitalist camp - however he did renege on doing his streak down Whitehall.</p>

<p>"Well, nobody's perfect.", as Osgood Fielding III said.</p>

<p>Yes. When it comes to the Labour Party Mr. Hodges has the 'knowledge'.</p>

<p>Yes, the extreme right does show itself, Cameron, Osborne, Hammond, arch capitalist imperialist warmongers doing the bidding of the NWO. But thankfully there some true conservatives in the party too, whose primary interest is their constituents and not faceless Wall Street moguls.</p>

<p>Corbyn makes Ed Miliband look like Churchill on steroids</p>

<p>Would the steroids mean using machine guns on working people, instead of the non-automatic weapons turned on his own people by Churchill?</p>

<p>Gave you an up because im an idiot</p>

<p>Corbyn does a rather good impression of a reanimated corpse...</p>

<p>Corbyn stick to the point and does what a politician should do rather than play the peacock. Unfortunately little minds have got so used to perfuming froth that they only associate with those who interest Heat Magazine and the like.</p>

<p>It's been a long time coming Dan but you at last understand what the Northern 'Kippers' have been saying for many months.</p>

<p>Hodges might be slightly relevant in a cringeworthy Uncle Tom kind of way, if anybody could even begin to understand what he's trying to say:</p>

<p>"One of his staff had clearly also recognised his EU response was cutting through like a cold knife through titanium, and so given it another shove."</p>

<p>WTF?!!!</p>

<p>I'd expect better English from an immigrant.</p>

<p>I have worked with titanium, however I have no idea how well it cuts with either a hot or cold knife.</p>

<p>And Dan "Migration Matters mouthpiece" Hodges is just the person to bring you one. Or 4 million. Or 40 million.</p>

<p>How many Dan?</p>

<p>Corbyn had it within his grasp to totally destroy Cameron and the Conservative party, and set himself up to be the next Prime Minister. If I had written his speech, he would have.<br/>He had an open goal, but left the field and went for a cup of tea.<br/>Labour MPs must be wondering which party to go and join, I have a suggestion.</p>

<p>"Corbyn had it within his grasp to totally destroy Cameron and the <br/>Conservative party, and set himself up to be the next Prime Minister."</p>

<p>how?</p>

<p>Indeed. It's a sad world that proves Iain Duncan Smith is more principled than Judas Corbyn.</p>

<p>Dan, just how does Corbyn think that he'll oppose TTIP? THe Lisbon Treaty does not include the right to strike, the UK only has 12.8% of the QMV vote and he's in opposition. Does he not realise the damage he's doing to Labour Voters? QMV will ensure we are dragged into TTIP and if it's anything like TPP, there will be mass redundency. Economists in NZ estimate TPP will cost the USA 450,000 jobs, the Candaians 45,000 and Japan 75,000</p>

<p>Don't worry, last June (2015) Judas McDonnell proclaimed there can be no blind support for EU membership without every detail of TTIP being in the public domain.</p>

<p>Oh, whatever happened to him?</p>

<p>Very funny Mr Hodges, far above your usual hackage. I have a theory: we have the identity of the antiMarxist mole "Agent UKIP"</p>

<p>OK more meule than mole....</p>

<p>He has secured nothing. The benefit "brake" is smoke and mirrors and there is no new treaty to encapsulate our so-called "special status". There is no legal standing to anything that these "leaders" agreed amongst themselves.</p>

<p>Jeremy's problem is he is haunted by the ghosts of his Left wing friends in the Party who were solidly against Britain being in the E.E.C. (Benn, Foot, Mikardo, Castle).</p>

<p>Corbyn's age is against him... he is already a gibbering idiot!</p>

<p>he's not actually, he still has a sharp mind for his vintage.<br/>he's only holding the Party together (not that I'm a supporter) for a while, it tied itself in knots under Miliband torn as he was between Marxism and New Labour.</p>

<p>"sharp mind for his vintage"?</p>

<p>He never had a sharp mind when he was young, so has he acquired one recently?</p>

<p>His vintage?<br/>He is  only in his mid sixties but sounds ninety!</p>

<p>Many ninety year olds are quite wise about life, they've seen a lot. The Party really is in deep trouble over the loss of two large constituencies, Scotland and the middle c.45% of England, many of whom voted Labour like their parents pre-1979.</p>

<p>Doesn't matter what he says.<br/>About anything, ever.<br/>Everyone knows he'll never win an election</p>

<p>Stop gibbering Hodges the benefit brake does not even save £30m a year.</p>

<p>That is £30 million maximum out of total government spending of £750 billion.</p>

<p>Now run along sonny and play with your toys.</p>

<p>Wow big on the old double talk there Dan. Firstly it is good to see that you are applying the same logic to the tories as you are the labour. When Labour's cabinet spoke out about Corbyn Policies it was as if the labour party were about to explode, now when it happens to the tories not a word about it...<br/>In this article you seem to deliberately miss Corbyn's point, which is that Europe currently is letting large corporate entities rule the roost, but to change this the UK needs to remain in the EU. He also pointed out our current PM's inability to secure a decent deal through his own limp wrist approach often snubbing good ideas (collective restrictions on banks and large corporations) and pushing for silly ideas like the restriction of free movement, which adds large amounts to our coffers.</p>

<p>All the large corporate entities will be happy to continue any deals we have made with them just as much if we come out as staying in.</p>

<p>So why is Judas Corbyn - a lifelong anti-EU politician - siding with Goldman Sachs, Shell and JP Morgan?</p>

<p>Actually, Corbyn is irrelevant to the UK too!</p>

<p>Corbyn is a lack lustre speaker. He seems to lack passion. In PMs question time he almost seems bored.<br/>Yesterday reply by him was awful. I am a UKIP and have been a Conservative loyalist, but I feel sorry for the true labour supporters who have been through thick and thin with their leaders. Now they have one who is mealy mouthed.</p>

<p>Corbyns is so far up his intellectual loftyness, that its obvious he despises his grass roots socialists. In that fact he and Cameron are the same. Cameron who brushes aside the grass root Conservatives.</p>

<p>He took over from Ed Miliband, the man who gave us the Climate Change Act, ruining our the few industries we have left. If he were to campaign against it, I would return to the fold that I left many years ago.</p>

<p>Corbyn needs his hairy nostrils trimmed!</p>

<p>Only about six Labour MPs have sided with the Out vote.  RIP Labour Party.</p>

<p>one of our champions is Kate Hoey, the lady is a fervent LEAVER.</p>

<p>Corbyn will continue to crash and burn,because like all loonie lefties he's good at one thing and one thing only.Destroying things.</p>

<p>The loonie left are only happy when they are smashing things to pieces.Spitting at people.Screaming at people.That's all they can do.</p>

<p>And Corbyn was finished even before he started as party leader.That's because there is no Labour party because it's just a busted flush of commies and fascists.</p>

<p>I do like all that, Nick!</p>

<p>They also use words like "scum" which highlights their intellectual lacking. Always turn violent as this is their only resort. Beyond sad! Best never to talk to loonies lefties and respect your own blood pressure.</p>

<p>its the tory rats who are pulling themselves apart and all you can do is attack corbyn why?</p>

<p>Because Dan <b>IS</b> the quintessential Tory rat.</p>

<p>The tory "rats" are in the process of shooting the rat...they are facing their conflicts and asking the public in a referendum what do they want. Once a decision is made the inners / outers will have to accept the choice given. Tory conflict will be over. Labour conflict is just starting, they are being hypocrites having taken one stance that was anti EU and now they are now just anti anything the government proposes.....and they are lead by a decrepit buffoon.</p>

<p>No such thing as a Tory rat!  Dan attacks Corbyn because the man is a nutter who is making an astonishing mess of being leader.</p>

<p>As I remember, he has always opposed the EU and suddenly supports it - and for all the wrong reasons. He needs to know the population of this country does not need any outside help in becoming any more over-crowded.<br/></p>

<p>In what sense is he making a mess of being a leader. He seems to be doing quite a good job of attracting new members and challenging the PM on various issues (which the PM seems happy not to answer)</p>

<p>Blimey! After reading that article one could be forgiven for thinking that Dan Hodges is a secret UKIP supporter.</p>

<p>Welcome aboard the good ship UKIP Dan.;-)</p>

<p>You'll love it.</p>

<p>Jezza and his team simply cannot keep up without the backing of the entirety of their party.<br/>This year of all years is not the time to turn inwards.</p>

<p>Corbyn's advisers are amateurs, an expensive historical misfortune. The spirit of this nation wants out of the clutches of the EU monster with all its as yet unseen, untold and unfolding evil. By not backing or showing intellectual sympathy, at the least for Brexit, Labour reveals its heart as blackened by its ignoble contempt for the electorate. A sad slow death of a political party who can't even stand openly and defiantly alongside the Junior doctors in the NHS's desperate hour of need. Corbyn and Milne are failing and betraying the blood, sweat and tears of the past and present in favour of a future they have not the wit or providential insight to understand or respect.</p>

<p>Corbyn can do and say whatever he likes at the moment. He can purge the Labour Party of closet Tories and get his act together. The Tories will now consume each other. The hatred between the inners and outers in the Tory Party cannot be over stated. They both believe they are acting in the interests of the nation and themselves, or should that be the other way around? Anyway Corbyn? Who is he? That is about where Corbyn is at. A good place to be. Labour could easily win the election now. It is their's to lose.</p>

<p>Worst case scenario for Dan now is a leave vote, the subsequent collapse of the pound and the FTSE, an exodus of big business from London, falling property prices, emigration and a realisation in the country that we've been sold a pup. Boris will be leader and that is when Corbyn will rise, like a rat emerging from a sewer and bite Boris' bottom. Very hard.</p>

<p>Do you really want to be outside the EU, with a Labour landslide just having happened and a national appetite to nationalise the land, to replace the monarchy with a president and Labour pulling out of the ECHR so it can confiscate the FTSE?</p>

<p>Careful what you wish for now Danny boy.</p>

<p>Good fairy story!<br/>Now go away and grow up.</p>

<p>Labour landslide? ha ha ha ha.</p>

<p>sounds like heaven I hope your right.</p>

<p>Mr Hodges, you are getting increasingly desperate. Have you thought of journalism as a career?</p>

<p>Tried it.  It didn't work out.</p>

<p>He is getting pretty personal now. He protests too much I think.</p>

<p>"Somehow the Labour party has contrived to use even an issue on which Tories are split as an engine for its own destruction"</p>

<p>Sounds good.</p>

<p>RW</p>

<p>I think the bottom line here is that Jeremy is a fool.  After thirty odd years on the back benches, he suddenly finds himself at the pinnacle of the Labour Party, and the most hated man in the PLP.</p>

<p>One of his colleagues said that he has never matured beyond adolescence. I thought that's what being a socialist in adulthood was all about.</p>

<p>He's leader because, like, he is entitled to it and that. He has been an MP for, like, 30 odd years and, like, no one else was any good so, like, he was entitled. We shouldn't diss him because, like, he is totes rubbish or because he is not black or anyfing. He is killing, like, Cameron innit</p>

<p>These articles are disparaging to the point of being dumb, bullying and childish. I used to think this was an intelligent newspaper. But appears the desire to push a political agenda completely eclipses that.</p>

<p>It is the complete intellectual dishonesty that baffles me and the entire double think that annoys me.</p>

<p>It's not as good as it once was. It's gone to UKIPPERish for my taste, but still better than the Times.</p>

<p>The circulation figures say otherwise.</p>

<p>The Torygraph is dropping like a stone, and now has fewer readers than The Times for the first time in absolutely donkey's years.</p>

<p>Indeed. The Times might be Murdoch, but at least it still appears to have subeditors and doesn't regard Buzzfeed as the pinnacle of its ambition.</p>

<p>'Supervisor 1 to Tory HQ. Agent Corbyn continues to function as programmed'</p>

<p>The Luvvies are livid and losing in Labour.</p>

<p>The Luvvies are losing.</p>

<p>hopefully, at last.</p>

<p>Really Hodges?<br/>You are a scratched record.<br/>Get over yourself and give us a break.<br/>Corbyn is leader of a the real Labour Party. you and the other war criminals were dumped, so go join the Tories where you belong.<br/>New Labour won those elections and they were more Thatcherite than the Tories. If you abandon everything you were created to fight for and become more Tory than the Tories, then you are not Labour.<br/></p>

<p>Labour was created for the British working class, not the petit bourgeoisie Islington intellectuals or the economic detritus of the world.</p>

<p>"you and the other war criminals..........."</p>

<p>Skating over an inability to punctuate, what ARE you talking about?</p>

<p>RW</p>

<p>No.. and it should be obvious to anyone with a brain</p>

<p>He's Dave Spart trolling.</p>

<p>Corbyn is a danger not only to the Labour Party but also the country. God forbid he ever gets into power because it would be the end of Britain as you know it!</p>

<p>I think Dave is doing his best to do exactly the same.</p>

<p>Maybe a spell with the Corbynistas in power is just what this country needs to knock some sense into it.</p>

<p>Not if enough people remember the 70s.</p>

<p>Very true, Then maybe all the trolls who support him would realise what stupid idiots they have been!</p>

<p>I was somewhat neutral on the EU until Cameron started lying about his deal and trying to take me for a fool. Vote out Cameron is a liar. </p>

<p>So Corbyn can also screw up when he's irrelevant.?<br/> Gee Dan you need to vent your hatred, envy, spite, anger and bile and get a life before this destroys you.</p>

<p>He is a laughing stock </p>

<p>I agree, Dan is laughable and also not very relevant.</p>

<p>Comrade Corbyn leads the Labour Party and he is a laughing stock </p>

<p>Corbyn has clearly been bribed, nobody would have such a contradiction in the space of a year.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This made for a good read until Dan himself started spouting gibberish. No one at all proclaimed that Cameron wouldn't be able to secure a petty deal on migrant benefits - everyone thought he would, and repeatedly said that it would be useless to do so. It will not quell the flow of mass migration into the United Kingdom.</p>

<p>Point taken. Labour cannot capitalise on the Conservatives' division on the EU question while Corbyn is facing every which way.</p>

<p>And the Labouring Party "heavyweights" just sit there in stony silence, gutlessly cowering before the gibberish. Frank Field and Kate Hoey as usual, but who ELSE is being both sensible and honest? </p>

<p>Corbyn has said that the Brexit Question is really something internal to factions<br/>within the Conservative Party, an intra-Tory Party fight.  That is true, but it avoids acknowledging that the Labour Party-- if it is 'serious' about defending the British working class-- must take a position-- however complex-- on how to deal with the reality that EU-membership automatically produces an economy that lowers British wages by encouraging labour-mobility from abroad and competition for wage/salary rates.<br/>The additional fact that the 'abroad' is the continental EU countries is, of course,<br/>no consolation. That is the nub of the matter</p>

<p>This is why you have a robust living wage something previous governments have been far too timid to enforce. However the fact is that the UK needs new bodies to help sustain its aging population and to that immigration is required. It is also worth pointing out that a study has shown that EU migrants have added more collectively to the economy than than they have taken.<br/>Our current problems have nothing to do with the EU and are infact constructs of our own systems. Ironically it is the EU that has protected us against various threats such as IDS welfare reforms and other such fiascos.</p>

<p>"It is also worth pointing out that a study has shown that EU migrants have added more collectively to the economy than than they have taken.</p>

<p>But only by fiddling the figures and including those EU immigrants that would otherwise have got a visa to work in the UK, or asylum under the asylum rules.</p>

<p>Exclude those, to limit the cohort to unskilled and semi-skilled individuals that would not get a work visa, and you get a very different picture.</p>

<p>It's quite blatant propaganda and I'm amazed people can't see it.</p>

<p>There are many reasons for getting out, one being that the EU is immoral, venal, corrupt, wasteful, destructive, incompetent and quasi-fascist.</p>

<p>Actually, of course, that is seven reasons.</p>

<p>Plus the 58 million quid PER DAY we pay and the near destruction of our fishing industry, and the ruination of southern Europe, our loss of border control plus the economic sclerosis through overregulation and high taxation.</p>

<p>You'd think there would be somehing there for Corbyn to get his teeth into, but apparently not.</p>

<p>PS This is bleedin' obviously NOT "really something internal to factions<br/>within the Conservative Party, an intra-Tory Party fight", but a matter of overwhelming and fundamental to every single person in Britain. Your comment could not be LESS true. </p>

<p><i>"it avoids acknowledging that the Labour Party-- if it is 'serious' about defending the British working class"</i></p>

<p>Since when have middle class Islington champagne socialists like Corbyn and his apparatchiks given a flying dog's testicle for the British working class?</p>

<p>They utterly despise them for being ignorant peasants with dirt under their nails, just something to be exploited for votes.  And, given that even after Rotherham and bigotgate a significant number of the British working class still vote for them, they might actually have a point.</p>

<p>Sadly there appears to be two factions in the Labour party vying for control. Those that want to ape the Tories and those that want to ape the Green party.</p>

<p>There doesn't appear to be a distinct Labour identity at all.</p>

<p>Danna a Dee doo day doo Dee doo Dee     Lol</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn - is a good man .</p>

<p>How on earth he is paid to be a politician , I will never understand</p>

<p>He is not a good man - he is a dissembler and a terrorist apologist</p>

<p>That has to be taken into account very seriously, his motivations are rather worrying to say the least. Didn't any one ever tell him communism has never actually worked where ever it has been tried on this planet ?</p>

<p>And capitalism is proving it doesn't work either.</p>

<p>Capitalism has taken more people out of poverty in the past fifty years, than any other system has achieved in the 2,000 years before that.</p>

<p>In fact, you only need to look at the Eastern European Nations and compare their existence under the USSR with their post USSR experiences.</p>

<p>Those that have embraced capitalism have seen anywhere between 50 to 75% increase in living standards in just 20 years. Those that continued to run a communist economy have seen only a 10% or so increase in living standards,</p>

<p>Well it does, but only for some communism works for a similar selected  few that capitalism does.</p>

<p>All systems that are held as dogma tend to favour the few.. but try explaining that to the true believers..</p>

<p>I said , he is a good man, do you have a problem with that ?</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>Yes</p>

<p>Spot on. By the way do you know if Comrade Corbyn is thinking of popping over again to re-annoy the local (French) residents of Calais to try for a few more leftie brownie points. Does he know how they really feel about the invasion and ruination of their town, does he care ?</p>

<p>I assume he 'cares' deeply. But, like the current Pope Francis,<br/> Corbyn is a committed Universalist who believes that "bridges are<br/>better than walls"-- as in his recent reported comments while <br/>visiting Mexico. This sort of position inevitably abuts particular<br/>claims in a Context of Scarcity. And Austerity and Deflation are<br/>signs of Scarcity. (The US working class, by the way, wants a Wall.)<br/>We are all now, world-historically, in a Context of Austerity where <br/>the actual Purchasing Power of the Mass of the Population is<br/> insecure and even shrinking... 'We' in Britain-- or, is it 'We' as<br/> humans anywhere, even in the hovels of Calais?<br/>As for Jeremy Corbyn, what else can he do? He is not the Pope<br/>nor the Archbishop of Canterbury; he cannot appeal to religious<br/>sentiment nor metaphysical theories. He must muddle through...<br/>if he cannot find a solution somewhere between Marx and Jesus.</p>

<p>In a 1970s book on Psychology  by Wayne W Dyer called Your Erroneous Zones the postscript is a scene in an AA clinic. The speaker has Two glasses of clear liquid on the podium. He places an earthworm in one which contains water and the worm wriggles around for several minutes. He places another worm in the glass of vodka the worm almost immediately perishes. He then asks the question to the audience. What do you see happened here ? One guy puts his hand up immediately and says, I see if you drink vodka you don't get worms.</p>

<p>Marx is dead and so as far as I can make out from all the fairy stories so is the other bloke. But Good luck with that one. <br/>But it's Funny how no one asks the real suffers of the 'bridges' what they actually think when their lives are turned upside down by all the publicity seeking bridge builders. <br/>And as far as I remember Calais was a lovely and bustling seaside town with god restaurants and decent beaches before the invaders moved in.  IMHO The only solution is not to encourage the perpetuation of the problem by housing and feeding these people. But get them out of the area spend the wasted money in their own countries educating them etc. and let the good people of Calais get their lives back. <br/>This could all happen even as JC just muddles through.</p>

<p>"...the hovels of Calais..."</p>

<p>You are obviously not a Brit to make a comment like that. Britain has the worst quality, smallest (average 77sq m per dwelling) rabbit hutch housing in Europe.</p>

<p>you are talking rubbish</p>

<p>But, have you consistently read Dan's articles ?</p>

<p><i>'But, have you consistently read Dan's articles ?'</i></p>

<p>Maybe he writes them?</p>

<p>It's the Alain Stone troll, drunk as usual.</p>

<p>Best not to feed it.</p>

<p>People are refusing to talk 2 me , is it because I am more un -PC ?</p>

<p>No it's because you are a pathetic, drunken moron.</p>

<p>no, you are drunk</p>

<p>and what is the Soviet Union going to do about it ?</p>

<p>You cannot drink plutonium.</p>

<p>is that what HQ told you ?</p>

<p>It must be tiring for Dan Hodges to write his counter factual articles in the face of all evidence to the contrary. He must throw his hands up in the air; "Why won't the little people simply accept we know what's best for them?" He still thinks its like the 90s when he was working for New Labour. Now he's long been marginalised in the Labour Party, (has he re-joined again only to leave yet this year?) he seems to have carved out a little niche for himself up Cameron and Osborne's rear end..</p>

<p>If Corbyn really is " completely irrelevant " to the debate, why has Hodges just devoted an entire column to him ? Bizarre.</p>

<p>Answer: Hodges is an obsessive-compulsive Corbyn-basher. His articles<br/>always tell us more about his backers' sensitivites than about his subject.</p>

<p>Laughably the BBC and Sky think that Boris making a speech has more effect on the pound/dollar than Trump and Clinton winning in the USA.  The pound to Euro is still well above the rate it was while I was in Germany 2010-2014.   The Euro also fell against the dollar today.</p>

<p>Channel 4 news also. And 'riven' was the word of the day.</p>

<p>Oh no, does Henny Penny know about it? What are the long term prospects of the sky?</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Mrs. Clegg, Mrs. Farage??</p>

<p>I was born in Communism, utopia for some people, nightmare for the others.</p>

<p>Corbyn - you will not last a day in Poland or Romania</p>

<p>have some orange juice it helps with tomorrows headache.</p>

<p>depends if the vodka has been made out of potatoes or grain.</p>

<p>Dan is like Corbyn's personal troll. Whatever the circumstances we are in and on a day when everyone else is talking about Cameron and Boris he can still squeeze out an anti Corbyn rant.</p>

<p>That's probably true, but Corbyn was indeed talking gibberish and someone had to call him out on it.</p>

<p>In case no-one noticed, in the footage in the above article Corbyn just called 50% of the British population xenophobic. What a wally.</p>

<p>Actually, Corbyns complete lack of presence today was commented on by many.</p>

<p>It was one of the few times he's tried to speak his own words without reading out questions from Anne of Grimsby. It showed what a confused empty vessel he really is.</p>

<p>I agree, I think Anne has a great chance in the next leadership election.</p>

<p>And an anti Farage rant and now he'll get his claws into Boris. It used to be Red Ed but he's no longer relevant.<br/>Dan hates the ones who see through the vacuous  Blairites vision , that's why he loves metrosexual Cameron.</p>

<p>The neologism is, I believe, "metrosexual" .</p>

<p>Corbyn deserves it after today's abysmal performance in the Commons.</p>

<p>Meanwhile why is Corbyn for the EU if he thinks it's so awful?</p>

<p>Of course the EU is 'awful', how could it be anything other than awful?<br/>Its huge, but lacks Majesty. <br/>Where a skilled pen could pick out each tooth and talon of a Dragon for special mention, each cast of the eye, with its malevolent intent, minutely described; not so the EU.</p>

<p>What the EU is, is a work in progress, a never-ending work in progress - best, by far, to be part of the process. Than run off screaming like a scalded cat.</p>

<p>Not when you have no influence in the process, no say and no control.</p>

<p>Ask one of Bernard Matthews turkeys if it's best by far to be part of the process.</p>

<p>The EU is a club - of sorts. Why should any single member rule the roost? (keeping to the fowl theme)</p>

<p>It is the Franco-German [Vichy-like?] alliance that rules the<br/>roost. Surprise, surprise....</p>

<p>So why be in it when 27 others countries all grubbing for their own little bit of self interest will make sure that your views are never taken into account.</p>

<p>Why do you want to hand over sovereignty to 27 other countries who don't give a damn about the UK?</p>

<p>Yet, those 27 countries will still be there, and perhaps caring even less - in the form of the EU.<br/>The EU is also currently negotiating trade-agreements with many of the Commonwealth nations.<br/>IF! we vote to leave the EU, we can hardly expect to escape the gravitational-pull of such a mass as the EU.<br/>It seems inevitable to me, that we shall remain bound-up with the EU. We yield up all ambitions of 'stewardship' and become a waiter at the table, the table at which we now sit.</p>

<p>Why would I wish to return to the old days, and have (whatever) sovereignty back firmly in the hands of some- odd - few?</p>

<p>Just pathetic. There's no point in having any sort of dialogue with you.</p>
