<p>A fascinating analysis of the Oldham by-election which, if true, is absolutely devastating..</p>

<p>Does it matter that there are now 30 Sharia Councils in the UK that run parallel to the legal system of the nation; they only affect Muslims, so should we care, what concern is it of ours?</p>

<p>In 2001 the ECHR states that Sharia Law is incompatible with liberal democracy, but as it only affects Muslims, should we care, what concern is it of ours?</p>

<p>A Muslim marriage is a religious act of worship, so should we care what happens to women within Muslim marriages - they do not affect the rest of us, so why should we care, what concern is it of ours?</p>

<p>Why can we just not ignore what Muslims do within their own communities, what they do does not affect us, so why should we care, what concern is it of ours?</p>

<p>What does it matter if the vast majority of Muslims have their votes cast for Labour in the way that they do, is that not their right, what concern is it of ours?</p>

<p>What does it matter if Muslims wish to live together in one community, win control of a local council through the ballot box and run the area in accordance with their wishes, why should we care, what concern is it of ours?</p>

<p>I would suggest that you try force your wife to wear pre-determined religious uniform, or perhaps mutilating her genitalia, or even have sex with a 13 year old child, and see how the British judiciary system would treat you. Of course, you could claim that you've converted to Islam, and that would make everything OK.......Wouldn't it....I mean ....who cares?... "WE", the rest of society, care. Anyone, no matter what their ethnicity or religion, are subject to British law if they reside in these isles, and any form of parallel system is technically "Illegal". The problem is, there is no will by either the police, the politicians, or the judiciary, to implement it. That's because they rely on the Muslim vote, so they all turn a blind eye to it. (A-la-Rotherham) The answer is: It bloody well does matter, and it matters greatly.</p>

<p>So, the reason you say you care is that 'they' operate outside of the law of the land and seem to get away with it - correct?</p>

<p>Absolutely. Let us supposed that you as an non-Mulim disagreed with the law that says you cannot marry a girl of under 16, but you did it anyway. Do you think the law would turn a blind eye to it? By allowing a parallel judiciary system to run side-by side with our own, you are aiding and abetting the undermining of British society and British culture. This is simply not acceptable to the rest of us who abide by the law of the land, regardless of our religious beliefs.</p>

<p>I agree entirely.</p>

<p>So, we have established that one reason we care is that Muslims seem able to flout British Law with impunity.</p>

<p>And - as importantly, they do so on issues that are entirely incompatible with our ways of life, beliefs, values, principles, traditions, customs etc.</p>

<p>If they can do so, why not Hindus, or Sikhs or Christians, Scientologists etc. One of our fundamental principles as a nation is that everyone is equal under the eyes of law.</p>

<p>So, yes, they may only be harming themselves and their own but they are being allowed to do so through positive discrimination.</p>

<p>Obviously you do not care about British values in Britain, Sock.</p>

<p>Four - now five - now six questions - not statements.</p>

<p>The principle that you enter a curtained off booth alone with a pen and ballot paper is there for a very sound reason. No matter what pressure or coercion has been brought to bear the voter can still make their own choice in such circumstances. Then go outside, smile and tell the bully that of course you voted for 'their' man.</p>

<p>Thousands of postal votes?  This is very very wrong and not the reason the postal vote should exist.  Unless there is a GP signed form and registration as disabled or housebound, to the point where even car travel is ruled out, then no postal vote should be allowed.</p>

<p>Postal voting now smacks of anti democratic practice and goon squad tactics. Anyone who has concerns about irregularities should go to the Police and electoral commission and supply a statement as to what they saw at the polling stations.</p>

<p>There's a case here to put this issue to rights. Lets see detailed handwriting analysis on these postal vote forms, ink scrutinised in a spectrometer, even fingerprint the documents.</p>

<p>"UKIP are bad losers" - so what is the implication?  Only those who win are entitled to complain about criminal activities.</p>

<p>Only the wealthy can complain about theft, only virgins can complain about rape, only [everyone but UKIP] can complain when the voting system is perverted and when honesty is lacking at the polls.</p>

<p>What a very odd approach.  Who is Susanne Evans?  We hear a lot from her but see very little accomplishment.  Is she an MEP?  Major donor?</p>

<p>Abuse of the voting system should be a concern to "all" parties who support democracy. If there is mal-practice it should also be of concern to you too. Just because you support the "winning" party, doesn't mean that it's OK and you can justify it. If it exists then it must be stamped out.</p>

<p>Voters are beginning to see through the BIG lie machine known as the right-wing press . Get over it Labour won !</p>

<p>Whites like you are becoming a hated minority in your own country.</p>

<p>Britain will end up just like Rhodesia.  The sooner the better.  Why?  Because you will not survive. Your smug, self-righteous ethno-masochism will not survive.</p>

<p>No. Of course Labour won.</p>

<p>Only the kippers are in denial.</p>

<p>Lol.</p>

<p>'Won'.</p>

<p>Don't forget the inverted commas..</p>

<p>The late-coming and unwarranted bundle of "postal votes" cries out for investigation.There needs to be a vetted process for the counting that is transparent and verified by each Party.Otherwise,the LibLabCon cartel is telling the People that "you can vote for whomever you wish, but you will still end up with the establishment".</p>

<p>There is a vetted process for the counting that is transparent and verified by each party.</p>

<p>No one's complaining about the counting, it's the vote casting in question.</p>

<p>Try following a conversation from the start. It makes you look less stupid when you interject.</p>

<p>More vote Fraud Islamists: <a href="http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/8375081.Five_who_tried_to_rig_post_votes_in_election_jailed/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thetelegraphandargu...</a></p>

<p>In my view there probably has been something untoward going on in Oldham, and it merits serious investigation.  But the big mistake Farage made was to open himself up to the charge from Tom "Witchfinder" Watson that he was suffering from a bad case of sour grapes: even if all the postal votes had been cooked in Labour's favour UKIP would still have lost. As an experienced politician, Farage should have realised this and opted for accepting defeat, and as a separate issue spent a little time gathering sufficient evidence to make a measured formal complaint to the authorities.</p>

<p>There's not going to be a complaint. Farage started this hare running to deflect attention from the shockingly bad campaign that he organized.</p>

<p>To accept defeat you surely are condoning the act, it is now being seen as the norm.<br/>Strike while the iron is hot, maybe a by election in two parts the walk in voter total,then the well scrutinised and checked postal votes to follow <br/> whenever.</p>

<p>Muslims and vote fraud come naturally:<a href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/bordesley-green-vote-fraud-trio-153709" rel="nofollow">http://www.birminghammail.co.u...</a></p>

<p>A fascinating analysis of the Oldham by-election which, if true, is completely devastating..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fahrenheit211.net/2015/12/04/oldham-was-it-the-bent-muslim-postal-votes-that-won-it-for-labour/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fahrenheit211.net/2...</a></p>

<p>Except it is not true.</p>

<p>Oh what a definite statement.</p>

<p>How do you know 'it is not true' and what evidence do you have to support your contention.. ?</p>

<p>Because <br/>1. it's blogged by one of the nuttiest conspiracy theorists on the Internet<br/>2. you posted it and you are one of the most useless posters in these pages.</p>

<p>Your evidence to support those assertions is.. ?</p>

<p>You posted it and your ability to be wrong is without parallel.</p>

<p>That post is especially absurd as it is you who is frequently wrong about a whole variety of issues and not me.</p>

<p>As I continually demonstrate, as well as pointing out your double standards and self contradictions which are very well known by regular readers here.</p>

<p>Except you lie again.</p>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>You were totally wrong for example about the desirability of Swiss referendums which have delivered what the Swiss electorate desires.</p>

<p>As well as being famously wrong about Lady Thatcher and regulation, and wrong a few days ago about regime change in Sierra Leone.</p>

<p>To name but a few examples.</p>

<p>The definition of Islamophobia that represents my view is:</p>

<p>....fear of the religion of Islam or Muslims.</p>

<p>Yep - damn right I am an Islamophobe.</p>

<p>So does Christianity according to certain interpretations.  You really think the nice bloke who runs your local corner shop wants you to convert at gunpoint you massive berk?</p>

<p>How do I know what the 'bloke', or his wife, is thinking or what words of encouragement he has on his mobile phone?</p>

<p>Well that's the point, you don't know anything about that person.  Jumping to the conclusion that local British-Asian businessmen want to convert you at gunpoint is all the more crazy for that reason.</p>

<p>OK _ where does that leave the residents of San Bernardino?</p>

<p>Do you actually think you're just made a point?  That's a non sequitur and a straw man.  Either make an effort or talk to someone else.</p>

<p>The real problem is that Islam and democracy are ultimately unachievable. There is this constant drive to achieve Sharia law within the host nation and to undermine the culture of that nation. They are peaceful enough until they obtain about 25% of the population and then the demands start and trouble comes with it. I think what summed it up for me was an Imam on one of these forums who argued that the Paris atrocity happened because the perpetrators were "French nationals" who had been corrupted by Western schooling and he stated that all Muslim children should only be schooled in Muslim schools/Mosques to understand good from evil. Oh, and he also said that the state should fund it. He must think the British people came up the Thames on a banana boat. Mind you, judging by the way the average Brit votes, he's probably right. You couldn't write this stuff if you tried.</p>

<p>Come on now either answer my question or at least try to justify the unexpected shooting of 'infidels' at their Christmas party.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, you are asking me where a refusal to place every single Muslim under suspicion leaves the residents of San Bernadino?  It's a stupid question and entirely beneath consideration.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate the colossal, yawning imbecilism of your question, let us consider Christian attacks on abortion centres.  Do you place all Christians under suspicion because of these attacks?  If not, where does that leave the victims of such attacks?</p>

<p>'Come on now either answer my question or at least try to justify the unexpected shooting of "heretics"'</p>

<p>Please tell me you understand how stupid your question is.</p>

<p>Do you recall the frequent episodes  of panic as people poured out of stations and other public places during the IRA bombing years?  Treat everyone with suspicion, report unattended bags and remove street waste bins. It happened and a legacy remains.</p>

<p>I was raised a Catholic so yes I remember being accused of either being complicit or of not saying enough or any number of other stupid accusations which had nothing to do with me.</p>

<p>The way you conflate what I was talking about i.e. the paranoid idiocy of fearing the bloke who runs the local cornershop with common-sense precautions i.e. reporting unattended luggage is mendacious.  Tricks like that just make you look dishonest.</p>

<p>If you are going to proceed with suspicion against every Muslim you ever meet, then you're a useful idiot for the enemy, not a conscientious citizen.</p>

<p>The general public were, and still are, the  eyes and ears of our communities.  Like it or not with a high state of emergency in place no one can disregard that. Being paranoid does not help anyone. I'm not. Being alert does.  CCTV does the rest.  Living in an area of 'Middle England' where 'others' choose not to venture does not make us feel any more secure. No doubt  our neighbours who have migrated in retirement, from London have done so for more than one reason..</p>

<p>Which political party do the majority of Muslims support and why?</p>

<p>Well they certainly don't support Islamophobic Ukip.</p>

<p>UKIP is a very sensible British patriotic party.</p>

<p>'UKIP is a very sensible British patriotic party.'</p>

<p>HAHAHAHA!  That's priceless - tell me another!</p>

<p>As an individual human being I am most definitely Islamophobic AND a supporter of UKIP. There may be other UKIP supporters who are also Islamophobic.</p>

<p>But UKIP is an inanimate entity it cannot 'be' anything. It is only what its policies declare it to be - and to the best of my knowledge there is no categorical policy declaration of Islamophobia.</p>

<p>'But UKIP is an inanimate entity'</p>

<p>Boy you said it Chewie.</p>

<p>Just like ISIS then as our elders and betters keep telling us.</p>

<p>I haven't heard anyone describe ISIS as an inanimate entity.  Can you provide a link?  If not, what on earth are you talking about?</p>

<p>Have you not heard our politicians trying to explain to the masses the phenomenon of IS, as an 'ideology' rather than an actual existing  army, country or political entity?  It may appear  simplistic from your heady height.  If you can survive the broadcast of BBC interviews  you may get the gist.  As a reader of the DT for over 50 years I  always reserve judgement.</p>

<p>No Ukip is not what it's policies are - that is just a list or empty intentions, it is what it does and who does it.</p>

<p>What it does is demonstrate Islamophobia and racism through its members and fascism through its leader.</p>

<p>Oh you mean just like a certain well known person who expressed 'dismay' to be in the 'minority' in London.</p>

<p>An Islamophobe I am, a racist and a fascist I am not.</p>

<p>Are there racists in UKIP - probably. Are there fascists in UKIP I doubt it. Are there other Islamophones in UKIP - probably.</p>

<p>The same could be said of the Cons and Labour.</p>

<p>There are arguments that Islamophobia is also racism, they are interesting, I would say that they are certainly equivalent given the ethnic mix of Islam.</p>

<p>However the trouble is that Ukip which used not to be fascist became it when Farage took it down market to attract the BNP vote.</p>

<p>Now everything is the fault of the new Jews - Immigrants.</p>

<p>How can you possibly play the R and I cards when you told us..</p>

<p>'I have commented a number of times at my dismay when I go to London and my skin colour makes it clear that I am now the ethnic minority.<br/>I have also commented on a few visits to the "Identity and Passport Service" where I was the only white person, in that temple to New Labour immigration policy.'</p>

<p>Your posts on the subject of immigration are becoming ever more ridiculous in view of the above.</p>

<p>Utter drivel.</p>

<p>So what are you saying now? Even if you actually know as seems very unlikely from your general confusion on these crucial issues.</p>

<p>Do you deny expressing 'dismay' to be in the 'minority' in London.. ?</p>

<p>If you did express 'dismay' to be in the 'minority' in London then of course you are the least qualified person to criticise others on immigration related matters for reasons of obvious hypocrisy.</p>

<p>Obviously in view of the above it would be far better if you ceased posting altogether to save your yourself from further embarrassment.</p>

<p>There is no argument that I know of that creates racism out of Islamophobia - it could even be a false dichotomy.</p>

<p>'There is no argument that I know of that creates racism out of Islamophobia'</p>

<p>You need to get up to speed with critical theory and Edward Said.</p>

<p>Thanks. I will.</p>

<p>What percentage of postal votes cast were cast by:</p>

<p>Muslim</p>

<p>Non-Muslim</p>

<p>Who cares, just the Islamophobes</p>

<p>And as one - I care, that is why I asked.</p>

<p>Sorry Soc, are you admitting to be an Islamophobe?</p>

<p>At least that would be honest.</p>

<p>What is wrong with that?</p>

<p>Absolutely. I have no problem whatsoever with that.</p>

<p>I credit your honesty if not your choice.</p>

<p>How many women turned up at the Oldham electoral stations and handed in their 'postal votes' already completed for them?</p>

<p>What religion do they submit to?</p>

<p>Labours white working class vote was massacred, stats say that 25% of voters are South Asian, 90% of them turned out to vote., and voted with postal votes. That figure equates to 15,000, Labour got only 17,300, so it means only 2,300 White working class voters bothered to support them. Take out 300 local activists and it is nothing to shout home about.They are haemorrhaging support in many Northern strongholds, those with 12% Asian or less must be extremely vunerable</p>

<p>Care to provide a citation for that?</p>

<p>UKIP lost votes and Labour gained votes.  There is a more straightforward analysis to be made using these figures.</p>

<p>That's a rather stupid pack of lies.</p>

<p>Ukip lost fair and square.</p>

<p>Usual drab crap.</p>

<p>Well, Ukip did lose fair and square.</p>

<p>It appears once again that you prefer to wallow in your delusions, sucking down whatever garbage the Dear Leader feeds you. And he'll lead all you poor fools up yet another blind alley, safe in the knowledge that you're incapable of independent thought.</p>

<p>'Another blind alley, safe' are you for real, do you really believe that the people of these Isles currently are safe ? and their safety has been due to the efforts of lab/lib/con the pro eu coalition if so you are truly demented.</p>

<p>Looks like you're quite happy to be led down that blind alley.</p>

<p>You should stop complaining about your electoral irrelevance in that case. Because you're only going to become more irrelevant.</p>

<p>Negative post per usual.</p>

<p>Positive actually. But I don't expect you to know the difference.</p>

<p>What are your  figures then?  If disqus  got them  so wrong.</p>

<p>The figures aren't out yet. That's why it's clear disqus made them up.</p>

<p>The question that needs answering is "Should it be Douglas Carswell or should it be Suzanne Evans to replace Farage"?</p>

<p>Well, Carswell wouldn't have seen Ukip hammered in the way it was in Oldham - but he doesn't appeal to the Kippers who liked the message in Oldham.</p>

<p>Ok, for those who wish to deflect the headline away from alleged electoral fraud by one ethnic group - and wish to discuss UKIPs immigration policy - - let us look at what UKIP says and not what those who SAY they are UKIP supporters on forums like this....fact not fiction.</p>

<p>UKIP will amongst other things:</p>

<p>Create a Migration Control Commission – with a remit to bring down net immigration, and establish a visa system based on an Australian points based system while assuring the right number of highly skilled workers from across the globe are able to enter</p>

<p>Increase Border Agency Staff by 2,500. Staff to be allocated in new division outside of current management structure</p>

<p>Establish an ethical Visa system for work, and study to be based on the principle of equal application to all people</p>

<p>Abolish rules discriminating EU citizens from non-EU citizens</p>

<p>No amnesty on illegal immigration</p>

<p>ON SECURITY AND ENTRY POINT SYSTEMS</p>

<p>We would establish one passport queue for British Citizens and a second passport queue for Rest of the World;</p>

<p>We would increase Border Agency Staff by 2,500, with staff to be allocated in a new division outside of current management structure</p>

<p>We would implement new technology that is able to ensure all passport and visa holders are counted in and out and identifies over-stayers, and we’d commence negotiations with other countries with biometric and improved technology for access to faster passport access to the UK.</p>

<p>ON EMPLOYMENT AND VISAS</p>

<p>UKIP plans to establish an ethical visa system for work, and study to be based on the principle of equal application to all people.</p>

<p>UKIP plans to abolish rules discriminating against non-EU citizens, in favour of EU citizens.</p>

<p>UKIP plans to establish a visa system based on the Australian points based system.</p>

<p>And UKIP plans a ‘Highly Skilled Workers’ only work visa, providing the opportunity for permanent leave to remain.</p>

<p>ON VISAS</p>

<p>We’d have five tiers for visas</p>

<p>These include the Highly Skilled Work Visa, the Temporary Unskilled Workers Visa, Visitors Passes, the Student visa, and the Family Reunion visa.</p>

<p>ON ASYLUM</p>

<p>We’d maintain principles of UN Convention on Refugees for Asylum and have immediate review of the asylum process which aims to speed up rights to Leave To Remain and discover logjam on those declined asylum statuses.</p>

<p>ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</p>

<p>UKIP will offer no amnesty on illegal immigration.</p>

<p>UKIP will increase the police enforcement team by 500 extra front line staff.</p>

<p>UKIP will improve technology at police stations to ensure better identification of illegal immigrants between enforcement and arrest.</p>

<p>And we’d review the current holding and accommodation for illegal immigrants.</p>

<p>ON CITIZENSHIP</p>

<p>Save for current applications and Highly Skilled Workers, approved asylum and family reunion, there will be no permanent leave to remain permitted outside of the new policy rules</p>

<p>Existing EU citizens will be offered the opportunity to seek permanent right to reside and citizenship in the UK when Britain leaves the European Union</p>

<p>Criminals will lose the right of citizenship</p>

<p>And we would remove the passports of those who choose to fight alongside terrorist organisations.</p>

<p>ON BENEFITS &amp; HEALTH</p>

<p>UKIP says that all Highly Skilled Persons will be required to have Health Insurance for 5 years.</p>

<p>UKIP says that all immigrants under the new, Australian-style points system will have to make tax and national insurance contributions for five consecutive years before claiming UK benefits.</p>

<p>And UKIP wants our government to have a fund developed to cover those migrants who fall outside of the above or in NHS.</p>

<p>**************************************************************************************</p>

<p>Let us work our way through it - sentence by sentence shall we...</p>

<p>Over to you.</p>

<p>You illustrate the major problem that UKIP has, and that is that it has no idea how the system works.  To say it is going to sort out border controls by adding 2,500 new hires is living in cloud cuckoo land.  You only have to read the reports of the recent NAO findings on the wasted £1Bn on the existing border control system to begin to get a feel for the levels of incompetence and ineptitude in Whitehall and the civil service.</p>

<p>Bolting our borders down to do what you suggest is going to take tens of thousands of extra staff, tens of billions of pounds and years to implement.  Meanwhile UKIP's approach is to make loud noises about some pie in the sky border tightening caper in preference to taking the fight to the jihadis in their heartlands.  The consequence is that UKIP will have us waiting to be picked off as these jihadis freely breach our almost non-existent security.</p>

<p>Laughable.</p>

<p>Well said.</p>

<p>Ukip haven't the vaguest clue.</p>

<p>Add that to Civil Service incompetence and we have the recipe for spending huge sums of money while making things worse.</p>

<p>No, you very sadly are the one who 'hasn't the vaguest clue', not least because you very evidently have never even read UKIP's immigration policy.</p>

<p>At least you admitted you have 'no idea' about Syria of course which is one of your very few posts which is 100% correct.</p>

<p><i>"because you very evidently have never even read UKIP's immigration policy"</i></p>

<p>Is there any limit to your lying?</p>

<p>I've enjoyed reading the Ukip manifesto, particularly the drivel on Immigration. When I came to read the (late) 2015 version I thought that it, having been authored by Suzanne Evans, might even make some sense and would thus be a problem for me.</p>

<p>I was silly to think it, Ukip is the Gift that keeps on giving, in this case even more nonsense about Immigration and how to make it worse.</p>

<p>Obviously you had not read UKIP's very sensible immigration policy because you had no knowledge at all of the very commendable 'visitors pass' which that highly esteemed party recommends.</p>

<p>So yet again there is no sense in your post at all.</p>

<p>Total drivel.</p>

<p>So do you deny telling us that you have 'no idea' about Syria?</p>

<p>Very evidently you did make that statement so obviously you are wrong again in your absurd statement.</p>

<p>As to UKIP's immigration policy, clearly it is perfectly reasonable to state that you have never even read it because you had absolutely zero knowledge about the 'Visitor Pass' proposed by UKIP.</p>

<p>Your serial denials about the 'Pass' being just so much nonsense as usual.</p>

<p>Drivel. As you well know a Pass to be effective has to be for an individual, which means a series of checks on identity and a whole bureaucracy to manage it.</p>

<p>This would take the number of Visa/Passes issued by the Home Office from 500,000 per annum to 22.5 million.</p>

<p>Clearly a particularly parrot-brained approach to the problem, but par for the course for the liars in Ukip and their gullible supporters.</p>

<p>Not necessarily at all.</p>

<p>A passport stamp is a form of pass, and backed by digital tech, passports call up a great deal of information in seconds.</p>

<p>So of course you have no idea what you are talking about as usual.</p>

<p>And who puts the passport stamp on, how does it stop people working in the UK unauthorised.</p>

<p>You haven't got a clue - except how to troll.</p>

<p>Who do you think puts on a passport stamp?</p>

<p>Obviously an official at entry point to Britain.</p>

<p>Passport stamps records entry and exit dates which clearly are useful in tracking the journeys of individuals at a glance.</p>

<p>Read this already, a complete load of b.....x.</p>

<p>Take Visas and Passes. What is the difference between them?</p>

<p>They are both clearly documents that would need issuing to identified people and would surely follow the established Visa procedures which require biometric details - as the only secure way now to ensure the documents are not forged. This would cost big money.</p>

<p>There are currently about 500,000 UK Visas in circulation. If tourist numbers from the EU are not to be reduced that then would mean registering, producing and dealing with an additional 22 million Visa/passes per annum. Quite apart from the inability of the Home Office to get anything right the ludicrous element of this is that Ukip propose just 2500 extra staff (let's forget how they propose to pay for them) - an extra 10% of Border staff which wouldn't even vaguely be enough to manage the bureaucracy let alone the incredible queues at ports of entry</p>

<p>The policy is a load of worthless soundbites for the terminally gullible.</p>

<p>That is blatant anti UKIP bias.</p>

<p>You clearly have no understanding of UKIP immigration policy as is very evident from your denial some days ago that there is a 'visitors pass' proposal.</p>

<p>As usual you get it wrong. The words "visitors pass" are just words for another kind of Visa.</p>

<p>A visitors pass to have any value will have to be issued by British authorities and issued to a specific identified person, or do you imagine them being handed out at bush shelters in Bulgaria?</p>

<p>If they are - as they must be - handed out by British authorities they will incur bureaucracy, to process applications, to register them, to manage the biometrics that go with them, then to manage them in a centralised database for entry into the country.</p>

<p>All of this done with just a 10% increase in workforce to handle 22 million more passes/visas.</p>

<p>Clearly the idea is stupid. The idea that only moronic or dishonest Kippers could come up with.</p>

<p>The problem is that UKIP is little more than a rejection of modernity, with all their supposed policies flowing from a font of disingenuous racism.</p>

<p>Succinct and true.</p>

<p>Oh you mean the baleful 'modernity' of mass immigration which you admitted the British electorate never wanted.</p>

<p>Baleful drivel.</p>

<p>So you deny telling us that the British electorate did not want mass immigration despite stating on 25th May 2013..</p>

<p>'Polly, of course I believe the electorate never wanted mass immigration'.</p>

<p>So of course your post is ridiculous as usual.</p>

<p>Someone put the cuttlefish back in its beak.</p>

<p>Oh dear, DIR has no argument as usual and has been shown up as making ridiculous posts.</p>

<p>Squawk. You total hypocrite.</p>

<p>You have no argument.</p>

<p>You told us that the British electorate never wanted mass immigration which is fact of Disqus record.</p>

<p>Drivel</p>

<p>So what are you saying?</p>

<p>That the British electorate actually wanted mass immigration?</p>

<p>I think we should be told..</p>

<p>No that you are posting your repeated drivel</p>

<p>What exactly is the alleged 'drivel' ?</p>

<p>Perhaps you don't even know..</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Certainly there has been electoral fraud on behalf of the Conservative Party and Labour, so do tell us about UKIP..</p>

<p>Oh come now, don't be so coy, you know perfectly well about Ukip electoral fraud.</p>

<p>Do tell..</p>

<p>Oh dear, it seems you are not as informed as you would like to pretend.</p>

<p>Post the data you have.</p>

<p>Give a man a fish, feed him for a day...</p>

<p>So you do indeed know nothing about this.</p>

<p>Well that is little surprise, though it is good to see you show it for once.</p>

<p>Do we have a reformed Polly before us?</p>

<p>You have made definite allegations so now you need to support those allegations.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>I said there might be electoral fraud in Oldham and so we agree.</p>

<p>You however have gone further and have made definite allegations against UKIP which you need to substatiate.</p>

<p>Anything you post.</p>

<p>Oh okkaay.</p>

<p>Well I sometimes quote your mixed up offerings here so obviously you accept that you post 'drivel'.</p>

<p>I however deny that I post 'drivel' other than your quotes.</p>

<p>Of course what you wrote was drivel. 99.9% of the time it is.</p>

<p>The irony of this exchange is that the little pigs are squealing about electoral fraud when actually their party practices the same thing.</p>

<p>Well do tell us all about electoral fraud on behalf of UKIP, and I will tell you about electoral fraud on behalf of Labour and the Conservative Party..</p>

<p>That would hardly be the point.</p>

<p>The issue is that the cry babies in Eukip, having been thrashed in Oldham are seeking to blame that failure on electoral fraud, rather than recognising that it was their own dire campaign that lost it for them.</p>

<p>They really are just saw losers.</p>

<p>When did UKIP say they should have won?</p>

<p>Oh come off it.</p>

<p>Come on.</p>

<p>When did UKIP say they should have won?</p>

<p>I certainly have not seen or read anything to that effect.</p>

<p>They've been bleating about their thrashing as if they are innocent victims that have been cheated.</p>

<p>The truth is of course that that squalid party is capable of anything and they got a telling off from the electorate, despite the disarray in Labour.</p>

<p>UKIP haven't got an immigration policy they *are* an immigration policy.</p>

<p>We've already got a rigorous screening process for non-EU migrants. And the current buoyancy of our economy is temporarily attracting labour from the EU, mainly specifically recruited by business. Lower economic activity will naturally adjust the need for labour, no need for an expensive bureaucracy, except for a very effective well staffed and resourced Border Agency.</p>

<p>People see them as a one issue party (immigration) and you complain, there's more to them than that, and we do not understand them.<br/>Every single thing you have posted is about one issue: immigration.</p>

<p>I have an open profile - take a walk through all of my comments if you wish and see how many issues I have covered.</p>

<p>This particular thread is about a consequence of one particular aspect of immigration - so yes, that is what I am focused on here.</p>

<p>How about their only MP voting for the tax credits cuts where I suspect most working families in Oldham rely on them?<br/>Don't you think people haven't noticed?</p>

<p>This is all entirely academic because first of all Ukip need to master the skill of getting elected.</p>

<p>Clue: get rid of the carpet bagger who alienates more people than he attracts.</p>

<p>Far left Corbyn offered UKIP the golden opportunity to seize that large part of the discontented northern Labour vote not accessible to the Tories. Patently badly failing when  faced with a new Labour leader from the 'awkward squad' seemingly more effective, personable and endearing than the mischievous and toxic hard right Farage. Both however are probably unsuited to government though, and need the Tories to badly stumble over an EU referendum debacle to move their parties dramatically further forward with the general voter.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>They also had 7,000 dubious postal votes.</p>

<p>Labour indeed had a respected local candidate, and are likely to repeat this tactic under Corbyn.<br/>For UKIP to attract disaffected Labour voters in the north not reachable by the Tories, the party may have to dramatically change tack after disappointment, and offer more attractive policies for the general voter.</p>

<p>Corbyn didn't want this candidate, he wanted his own man.</p>

<p>If he is a quick learner, this by-election result will point him in a viable direction to regain some seats in the next GE. But the Tories could still be tough to beat, unless they mess up the EU referendum - very possible. Then all bets are off.</p>

<p>They also need to dump the Fascist Farage.</p>

<p>What evidence do you have to support the word 'fascist'?</p>

<p>Why would you want to 'dump' Nigel Farage anyway when you clearly agree with him on immigration related issues?</p>

<p>As is very evident from your anti immigration speech as follows..</p>

<p>'I have commented a number of times at my dismay when I go to London and my skin colour makes it clear that I am now the ethnic minority. I have also commented on a few visits to the "Identity and Passport Service" where I was the only white person, in that temple to New Labour immigration policy.'</p>

<p>Clearly Farage is a Fascist.</p>

<p>Quite apart from him being identified as such in his youth and by Professor Sked.</p>

<p>He now scapegoats immigrants for all the ills of the country - health, language, HIV, housing, terrorism, employment, even the traffic.</p>

<p>This is exactly the first step that the Nazis took in isolating the Jews and blaming them for everything.<br/>.</p>

<p>I NEVER used to say that Ukip was Fascist, in fact I would argue that it wasn't, unfortunately Farage has crossed the line and his party - which evidently supports him - has to now be identified for what it is. Britain's latest Fascist party.</p>

<p>Ever stopped to consider that Nigel Farage could well be largely right.. ?</p>

<p>Anyway, we know that you agree with him in some respects thanks to your strongly worded anti immigration speech, which goes further than anything Nigel has ever said..</p>

<p>Farage is nearly never right. He shares this in common with you.</p>

<p>In fact I find it very useful, whenever you claim something it is almost certain you will be wrong.</p>

<p>But you agree with Nigel as your following statement clearly demonstrates so your post makes no sense at all I'm afraid..</p>

<p>'I have commented a number of times at my dismay when I go to London and my skin colour makes it clear that I am now the ethnic minority.<br/>I have also commented on a few visits to the "Identity and Passport Service" where I was the only white person, in that temple to New Labour immigration policy.'</p>

<p>Yet more drivel.</p>

<p>Your 'dismay' to be in the 'minority' in 'London' speech is of course very well known by all regular readers here so your denial is just ridiculous.</p>

<p>Everyone can see that your words are very Farage-esque, and in fact your words actually go further on the issue than anything Nigel has ever stated..</p>

<p>London's been a big entrepot port since the Romans founded it 2000 years ago. The latest archaeology from that period suggests it was a very mixed population even then, as it is today and likely to continue so long as it remains the most buoyant  trading part of the UK.</p>

<p>Indeed.  Speaking as a Londoner, I would rather have visitors from the far flung corners of the world than the small minded w*nkers of middle England.  Have you noticed how it's always people who don't know any ethnically non-English people who moan about multiculturalism not working?  Multiculturalism works fine thanks - I see it working every day.</p>

<p>In their close knit communities  suppose.</p>

<p>Thanks to invasion, and thanks for the parallel..</p>

<p>The Romans dramatically upgraded Britain's economy by instituting town life and trade. Most of our modern main roads and many farming villages were brought in to being by the Romans, not least all those with foreign place-name origins.</p>

<p>Oh you mean that the Roman invaders were a better class of invader than the present lot..</p>

<p>Yes, you're probably right there.</p>

<p>And now the Romans are just history, and the high numbers of foreign people they brought here now unrecognisable in our present population. Their legacy helped produce the successful Britain though. Fortunately the Oldham result shows that most voters still remain steadfastly resistant to UKIP nonsense.</p>

<p>Well you did tell us that the Romans were a superior class of invader compared to the present lot.</p>

<p>As you refer to UKIP nonsense, presumably you would refer also to YouGov nonsense, as YouGov recently demonstrated that the British electorate by a large majority wants a 2 year 'total ban' on immigration.</p>

<p>I don't suppose the Romans hand picked the slaves they brought here.<br/>On your second point, impracticable without turning the UK into a closed economy like say N Korea.  Doubt voters, except Kippers perhaps, would choose that alternative if asked the question alongside the YouGov survey.<br/>Again you demonstrate UKIP's dead end  'one trick pony' failing politics.</p>

<p>That fashion crime of the yellow corduroy trousers is almost enough to have him arrested. polly.</p>

<p>As Nigel loves sensible Margaret Thatcher type policies, obviously he also goes for the retro 1980s Sloane Ranger look..</p>

<p>Sloane Ranger = townie rich toff pretending to be a huntin' shootin' fishin' rural chappie.</p>

<p>Hardly surprising he didn't go down too well in Oldham then?</p>

<p>Nigel's UKIP was obviously far more popular in Oldham than the Conservative Party which they beat into pulp.</p>

<p>A missed open goal. Evidentially UKIP will need to dramatically change policies to progress in the north, where the Tory's unfortunate historical baggage greatly hinders electoral gains.</p>

<p>Yes the Conservative Party completely missed the goal, but of course the Labour alleged 'victory' does look very suspect.</p>

<p>No, UKIP were the upstarts expecting to take the by-election seat. They missed an absolute sitter. And will continue to do so until they dramatically change policy and get somewhere near the requirements of the general voter.</p>

<p>Perhaps you would like to elaborate on your hypothesis..</p>

<p>Move UKIP towards disaffected northern Labour voter ground i.e. centre politics. Patently not current UKIP territory. And the Tory's won't be moved much either until they do. Rants by your leader are simply causing further damage to UKIPs prospects.</p>

<p>That must be why UKIP's vote went up from about 20% to approx 24% in Oldham.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Labour's alleged 'victory' is mired in controversy.</p>

<p>Unconvincing. UKIP missed a sitter. 6000 votes only in a very big town.</p>

<p>Coming second in a FPTP system seems to be his speciality.</p>

<p>The shame is when he starts to cry about the system being "bent" without then providing any concrete evidence to the police. We are inclined to believe that he is just a bad loser, despite all the experience he has of losing.</p>

<p>Prior to the elections Farage and Kippers on this forum kept telling us UKIP would have an upsurge or even possibly win it, but after a poor performance they are quick to find the bogey man (Asian vote and specifically Muslims). Funny how they seem to have come to the sudden realization of the demographic make up of Oldham . I bet if they had increased their share of the vote or even won they would be lecturing us on how this proves UKIP is an inclusive party. The sad thing is it is exactly this kind of language that turns people away from UKIP</p>

<p>Quite. The only Ukip posters were ones banging on about immigration. Couple that with Farage coming out with Muslims having 'divided loyalties' and other 'enemy within' rhetoric - it's just stupid to then act surprised that the vote goes against you.</p>

<p>Surprised that Farage is such a bad loser after all the practice he's had at it...</p>

<p>.<br/>Keep at it, one day you will think of something original all by yourself......perhaps.<br/>.</p>

<p>It may have been said before but it's still very appropriate in this case -  the more practice the man is gaining as a loser the better he should be able to accept it.</p>

<p>Anyone with half a bit of gumption and humility would have resigned by now.<br/>No wonder Nige is staying where he is.</p>

<p>.<br/>That's an opinion of course.<br/>.</p>

<p>Yes and not  just mine - even Suzanne Evans is saying all the whining is making UKIP look like bad losers...</p>

<p>Farage likes to throw in the crowd all the negatives as he sees them about 'Muslims' and we get very dim witted people voting for UKIP because of those words.<br/>If he ever became PM he would NOT eradicate Islam from the UK that is actually impossible and tbh 'not practical'.<br/>Will he close down all, the mosques?<br/>Kick all the non whites out of the country?<br/>No. Not a chance.<br/>It's an impossible dream for very silly people.<br/>Yet people as we see with the dumb comments here think he just might.<br/>More and more of the working class he pretends to represent are realising what a free marketeering little oik he is and al this talk about being the only party to represent them is being exposed for the hoo ha it is.<br/>Carswell voted for tax credits cuts, and that is supposed to represent 'ordinary working people?'<br/>I do not think so.<br/>Running out of both funds and puff, RIP UKIP.</p>

<p>Class war in this country only exists because of all the negatives of envy and hate thrown about by the Labour Party.</p>

<p>At least Farage has widened the debate and the sad efforts by the Momentum/NUS alliance to close down thought in universities is starting to come unstuck.</p>

<p>"The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum....” - Noam Chomsky</p>

<p>.</p>

<p>Not according to Warren Buffet <br/>“There’s class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”</p>

<p>NO ONE but NO ONE is talking about closing down all of the Mosques or kicking out non white - NO ONE in the UKIP party that I know of - so that is just a smear.</p>

<p>What I though most certainly am advocating is closing down any Mosque or any other establishment that allows, Salafists, Wahhabist or Qubists or any other extreme radical sect that spouts hate and death towards ALL Unbelievers.</p>

<p>I am also advocating doing EXACTLY what Australia has agreed to do and that is kick out any of the above with dual with dual nationalities who act the way described above,</p>

<p>I am also seeking to close down the cultures, traditions and customs that are not only allowed but encouraged in Islam that are completely incompatible with our democracy and ways of life.</p>

<p>And yes I happen to be a UKIP supporter but I have received support for that position from across the political divide.</p>

<p>Plenty of avowed Kippers on here do advocate such lunacy such as closing down mosques and kicking out non-whites. And almost no other kippers slap such nonsense down (a honourable mention to browntrousers here, who does).</p>

<p>Name them - and PROVE they are UKIP supporters.</p>

<p>One just has to look at the South Thanet campaign to see the deep malaise.</p>

<p>You really need to get rid of Farage.</p>

<p>Here is detailed and extensive commentary on the Oldham by-election..</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fahrenheit211.net/2015/12/04/oldham-was-it-the-bent-muslim-postal-votes-that-won-it-for-labour/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fahrenheit211.net/2...</a></p>

<p>The domain name says all we need to know about this delusional tosh.</p>

<p>So far all that any one has said is that <br/>1. people were milling around a polling station but we don't even know who said this.<br/>2. Farage claimed the election was bent then others like Suzanne Evans contradicted him.</p>

<p>Is it any surprise the Muslim vote went to Labour when Farage is such an unmittigated fascist and Ukip is stuffed full of Islamophobes.</p>

<p>Why is it 'delusional' when the form of activity described appears to fit exactly with the report by Mary Ann Siegert in the Independent.. ?</p>

<p>From the Daily Telegraph about a previous by-election..</p>

<p>'There was uproar on the day of the vote when three "unexplained", unsealed ballot boxes appeared at the count and were included, along with a plastic bag stuffed with votes for Labour.'</p>

<p>As you well know, the system has changed.</p>

<p>Insufficiently.</p>

<p>It is perfectly clear that postal votes can still be signed and birth dated, and then handed to others for completion.</p>

<p>So effectively nothing has changed in that respect.</p>

<p>How many postal votes were rejected at the count for containing incorrect information?</p>

<p>"So effectively nothing has changed"</p>

<p><b>This is another of your lies.</b></p>

<p>As you well know the process is no longer managed by the head of house who in the past could have claimed 50 people living in a terraced house and signed them all off himself.</p>

<p>No lies on my part, just endless closed mind anti UKIP pro Labour bias from you.</p>

<p>Tower Hamlets showed that postal votes are not checked against a data base, and the transfer of votes between individuals is still perfectly possible.</p>

<p>In addition to blatant coercion where the head of a household can easily still take control of everyone's vote in the house.</p>

<p>Yet again you neglect the change that took place where the register was the responsibility of the head of house. This was a GROSS corruption.</p>

<p>The minor possible corruption that is left is that, just minor. In many if not most households people will tend to vote the same way.</p>

<p>All you are doing again is another mindless troll.</p>

<p>But the 'head of house' can easily impersonate all the individuals in the house provided he knows their basic data.</p>

<p>This falls in line exactly with the coercion identified by Mary Ann Siegart in her piece in the Independent.</p>

<p>So yet again, your post makes no sense at all I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Squawk, you still have not provided ANY evidence that there was any fraud.</p>

<p>You still haven't read Mary Ann Siegart's article in the Independent which clearly illustrates your closed mind attitude about this crucial issue.</p>

<p>I know perfectly well that there CAN be fraud.</p>

<p>You however have not provided ANY EVIDENCE WHATSOEVER that there was.</p>

<p>You said it is 'not true' that there was electoral fraud in Oldham.</p>

<p>So that is a U turn already and at least a step on the way towards reality.</p>

<p>No U-turn.The irony is that the little pigs are squealing about fraud when actually their party practices the same thing.</p>

<p>You U turned, so do stop squirming and trying to get out of it.</p>

<p>You changed your tune from 'not true' to..</p>

<p>'Speculating that there might have been fraud - and there might have been - does not mean there was.'</p>

<p>Oh indeed but Ukip fraud happens to be proven, unlike the speculation you make.</p>

<p>Well go ahead and tell us about it instead of being so shy..</p>

<p>I'm hardly shy, I'm just flabbergasted that you claim not to know.</p>

<p>Surely you are well-informed??</p>

<p>Well you're being very shy about posting evidence to support your assertions.</p>

<p>Not as shy as you - DAYS you have been making allegations of fraud in Oldham and NEVER produced ANY Evidence whatsoever.</p>

<p>I said there might be fraud in Oldham.</p>

<p>You originally denied it, but subsequently you U turned and agreed with me.</p>

<p>So you have no point to make I'm afraid.</p>

<p>Not at all. I'm almost (but not) surprised at your hypocrisy.</p>

<p>When you make so many evidence free assertions - like these you have been making about electoral fraud in Oldham - you NEVER produce evidence, in this case I have asked you perhaps 100 times to produce evidence of the alleged fraud by Labour and you have failed to produce anything at all.</p>

<p>So go on then, I'll help you find the evidence of REAL Ukip electoral fraud - as shown in a court of law - when you provide evidence of Electoral fraud in Oldham.</p>

<p>Go on, produce your evidence about UKIP.</p>

<p>Why are you holding back?</p>

<p>We agree about Labour of course. There might be electoral fraud by some Labour supporters in Oldham.</p>

<p>You have not produced any evidence that there was not electoral fraud in Oldham.</p>

<p>You just say there wasn't, which is meaningless posting by you as usual.</p>

<p>YOU are the one claiming Fraud. YOU have to show it.</p>

<p>You completely fail to provide ANY evidence that there was any fraud.</p>

<p>You said that it is 'not true' that there was electoral fraud in Oldham.</p>

<p>How do you know that with such certainty and what evidence do you have that the by-election was squeaky clean?</p>

<p>Innocent until proven guilty. A good principle.</p>

<p>Show hard evidence that there was fraud and I will accept it.</p>

<p>All you have provided so far has been hearsay and speculation.</p>

<p>Lol.</p>

<p>So the 'head of house' can still take responsibility and action registration for everyone living there. He/She can even use own signature in another individual's name when registering thereby facilitating postal vote completion at a later date.</p>

<p>Of course nothing stops impersonation where an individual collects multiple polling cards and uses them to vote in multiple names in different polling stations.</p>

<p>So yet again your post makes no sense at all I'm afraid..</p>

<p>Drivel.</p>

<p>Not at all.</p>

<p>There is nothing in the latest changes to stop a 'head of household' impersonating every individual in the house for postal vote purposes, provided he/she knows their dates of birth and NI numbers.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is nothing in the changes to prevent someone collecting polling cards and voting by use of those cards in different polling stations. Or giving those cards to others to perpetrate a similar impersonation.</p>

<p>In addition to which, the issue of coercion is unchanged exactly as Mary Ann Siegart outlined in her excellent piece in the Independent.</p>

<p>Still no evidence of fraud from you.</p>

<p>The point is that other Kippers (apart from browntrousers) never argue with them - maybe pointing out that such isn't Ukip policy.</p>

<p>Like you are doing again.</p>

<p>Actually the Ukip allies Britain First are talking about just that...</p>

<p>Then please correct and redirect your comments to where they should lay.</p>

<p>So, once again, a Kipper is happy to just ignore this. Surely you should be pointing out to them that Ukip is opposed to this.</p>

<p>I repeat - UKIP policy is detailed on its website. If you want to debate anything said on there I am more than happy to do so.</p>

<p>There is nothing at all to be gained by giving oxygen to those who purport to be UKIP supporters or give their personal opinion.</p>

<p>I'm afraid that Ukip does far too little to distance itself from the extremists and their thugs.</p>

<p>We saw this in South Thanet/Broadstairs when there was an outbreak of extremism from the National Front with some of their thugs running around shouting their usual "Peadophile Protection Party" etc at some elderly innocent Anti-Ukip campaigners.</p>

<p>This was condemned by the Tories and Labour together. Ukip said NOTHING. Instead they cynically took the picture of the Tory and Labour candidate and claimed it was the LibLab establishment getting together.<br/><a href="https://twitter.com/john3ners/status/592063974025338881" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/john3ners/...</a></p>

<p>Some of the other things that Ukip got up to in South Thanet show the party at a national level to be not just absolutely disgusting but also fascistic. They reveal at best a deeply sick party.</p>

<p>Oh yes there is - it shows UKIP in it's true light and not by the image it likes to portray.</p>

<p>I agree with much of what you say, if there is behaviour at any mosque that causes concern, but what I see time again on message boards is many UKIP voters spit the word Muslim' out as if it is poison.<br/>We need to stop dealing with the Saudis with the arms trade, I do believe that.<br/>Does UKIP?<br/>Anyone else 'talking our jobs' too, c'mon, it is a major riff amongst supporters is it not?<br/>As it is I see the EU as a bit of a busted flush in its current form any way.<br/>No need for a referendum.<br/>But what exactly does UKIP offer to 'the ordinary people' in place of that?<br/>Their only MP voted with the government to slash money from the very people they espouse to be taking care of.<br/>All we see is lower earning working class voters seeing UKIP as some sort of solution, and there is an element of getting rid of Johnny foreigner being the solution to it all.</p>

<p>Please stroll through the UKIP website as it the policies on there that represent the views of UKIP not me or any other UKIP supporter  or many others on here who pretend to be UKIP supporters to give it a bad name.</p>

<p>Come along, you at least soc should be able to see through the nonsense that masquerades as "policy" on the Ukip website.</p>

<p>The very best that can be said for them is that they are carefully selected to be everything to everyone, a mix of populist measures the togetherness of which would be a complete disaster for the country, most of them are just plain moronic.</p>

<p>Happy to discuss each one in detail, why not start from the top and work our way through - one by one.</p>

<p>Immigration and the Aussie rules PBS, demolished by Migration Watch for starters.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.migrationwatchuk.org/briefing-paper/11.33" rel="nofollow">www.migrationwatchuk.org/brief...</a></p>

<p>You leave me with no other possible conclusion other than you are not Degree educated - what you have just produced is a headline response to an article and directly compared it to a policy when they are not comparable.....</p>

<p>******************************************************************</p>

<p>Create a Migration Control Commission – with a remit to bring down net immigration, and establish a visa system <b>based</b> on an Australian points based system while assuring the right number of highly skilled workers from across the globe are able to enter.</p>

<p>********************************************************************</p>

<p>I have highlighted the relevant word that you can now focus on.</p>

<p>There are many PBS - UKIP will BASE theirs on the Australian version - it will not COPY it in its entirity.</p>

<p>Sorry Soc that is utterly weak and not worthy of someone who would claim to be university educated, quoting directly from the Ukip propaganda website caps it nicely.<br/>.</p>

<p><b>Aussie Rules PBS</b><br/>Migration Watch - the most authoritative voice on Immigration have highlighted the unsuitability of an Australian style system.</p>

<p>They said:<br/><i>it is "thoroughly unsuitable for the UK"</i> and<br/><i>its "purpose is to promote immigration, not to limit it"</i></p>

<p>It actually works quite well in Australia - to promote immigration - where the population is around 28% immigrant - (of foreign birth) vs 14% for the UK.</p>

<p>Yet the liars in Ukip would have us believe that <u>a system to promote immigration can magically be transformed into a system to reduce it</u>.</p>

<p>But they NEVER specify HOW, no detail, just some undefined Migration commission staffed by degree educated alchemists no doubt.<br/>.</p>

<p><b>Visas</b><br/>Then I can go onto the utterly laughable Visa/Pass system, which would mean applying Visa/Passes to the 22 million Visitors we currently get in the UK from the EU every year.</p>

<p>The number of Visas currently managed by the "Not fit for purpose" Home Office is currently 500,000 pa - yet Ukip liars expect us to believe that with just a 10% increase in workforce (2500 people) they can handle a 44 fold increase in workload, even without the hassle of checking Visas and Health insurance at the Ports of Entry and making sure they go when they say they will.<br/>.</p>

<p><b>Please don't debase yourself by trying to defend this completely dishonest policy</b>.</p>

<p>Where do they say the Australian PBS cannot be adjusted to suit British conditions?</p>

<p>Why don't you point out to pakgila below, who claims to be a Kipper, that his views are not those of Ukip?</p>

<p>The problem is that readers have no idea which are real Kippers and which aren't. Made trickier in that Kippers never point out that such extremist views aren't Ukip policy.</p>

<p>AGAIN - all  you have to do is to read their policies as stated in black and white for everyone to see on their website.</p>

<p>Policies which as I have explained elsewhere don't stand up to even the slightest inspection.</p>

<p>No. You Kippers are perfectly happy for extremist bilge to be promulgated in Ukip's name. It's your problem, not mine.</p>

<p>The real reason UKIP have problems with postal votes courtesy of Newsthump</p>

<p>Farage told reporters, “Postal votes require literacy, comprehension, the use of a pen and licking of a stamp – how can we expect our core UKIP supporters to undertake such an arduous process?</p>

<p>“We struggle to get UKIP supporters to a ballot box to put an ‘x’ in the right place, so how are they supposed to vote at home with no-one around to help them?</p>

<p>“The postal vote system is clearly biased towards those people with ability to read, write and walk to a post box – so of course UKIP didn’t do very well.</p>

<p>The Islamic Labour Party. </p>

<p>The Muslims have hijacked the Labour Party. </p>

<p>All of the questions below are perfectly valid and need to be answered if we are to have faith in our electoral system.</p>

<p>It is hoped that a thorough police investigation is carried out at what on the face of it looks like yet another case of mass electoral fraud.</p>

<p>We must not allow those who cry Racism to prevent the course of justice - not least than because this is too important an issue for that term to be allowed to protect the guilty but also because of the blindingly obvious - Muslims are not a race.</p>

<p>Has the carpet bagger actually made a complaint to the police yet or was that all just more hot air?</p>
