<p>you can lock up a crook but not a liar, if you tell lies you better have a good memory, sadly lacking in this case.</p>

<p>nothing but a chump with his head stuck up his a*se</p>

<p>£13bn benefits go unclaimed every year. Cut tax credits, and wait for the welfare bill to go up</p>

<p>I am no fan of George Osborne but knowing of a family with both adults working that get £900 per month, whilst paying for two kids at private school and renting a house for £2400p.m., something has to be done.</p>

<p>People just lie about work, earnings and relationships....thousands of folks are up to it because it's so easy to do.</p>

<p>It is a debilitating scam. Encourages dependency. As Shaw  said,' Robs peter to pay Paul and we all know who Paul votes for".</p>

<p>Jeremy Corbyn seems to be winning without actually having to do anything!!!!</p>

<p>Apart from the fact that he is not winning anything.</p>

<p>That's just right-wing clap-trap and totally wrong.<br/>You hate Corbyn and won't recognise his achievements.<br/>He won Parliamentary Beard of the Year a RECORD five times.</p>

<p>He's a real saddo then!!! :)))</p>

<p>Well, lets say the conservatives are losing without Jeremy Corbyn having to do anything.!!!!!!</p>

<p>I bet he thinks his new job is a piece of cake!!!!</p>

<p>The conservatives are self-imploding!!!!!!</p>

<p>Gordon Brown created this mess not Osborne, <br/>If  GO stands firm he gets my vote</p>

<p>The British political system lies exposed as a complete sham.  A bunch of clerics, "famous" people and other reprobates have thwarted the will of the majority government.</p>

<p>Get rid of 1) the House of Lords (replacing it with a PR-installed second chamber), 2) the king or queen as figurehead (give them a decent pension, index linked), and 3) the C of E as established religion.</p>

<p>Then you might be getting somewhere.</p>

<p>Think you should go and lie down.</p>

<p>Wrong.   tax credits are £30 billion</p>

<p>Good point. Sadly, They care more about Pakistanis than British people here in Britain.the foreign aid budget is an outrageous waste of uk money when we our own kith and kin suffering</p>

<p>Osborne sprung these measures (together with the increase in the minimum wage) just weeks after the election, representing the most significant change to the arrangements for the lowest paid in years.</p>

<p>He is on weak ground claiming a democratic mandate, because almost nothing was said about any of it during the election campaign. Indeed most Tory MPs seemed completely blindsided by it in the budget.</p>

<p>The whole "Budget as political theatre" is a nonsense at the best of times, but when the Chancellor seems compelled to announce surprises just after an election, it is a travesty of democracy. It also leads to poorly thought through decisions, and people feeling cheated, like this time.</p>

<p>The only thing said during the General Election campaign was Cameron promising not to cut them.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there are millions of great mums out there looking after kids left behind by errant fathers. I hope you get child support and are glad we have the NHS, state schools, libraries, etc. These are what make liberty and freedom. But with that comes responsibility. And you chose to have a child and chose to not take full advantage of the education presented to you. Your struggle was partly of your own making.</p>

<p>I realise you are not complaining, but all young people should realize their choices have consequences.</p>

<p>As for tax credits, they are clearly an absurd way of helping people like you (who should be helped.) I would rather see zero tax on wages up to around 25K pa, and a minimum wage of around 10GBP per hour effective immediately. In addition, there should be child support to encourage young couples to have 2 or 3 kids. Support should be limited to 3 kids in order to discourage Muslim parasites from having large families knowing the state will carry the cost both of care and sedition.</p>

<p>As for zero hour contracts, they are yet another evil creation of US corporate greed.</p>

<p>So good luck. work hard and enjoy your beautiful child.</p>

<p>.. but that's exactly what Labour policy does to you :  turns you from an independent and resourceful person into a supplicant who is derided as a parasite.<br/>Welfare trap</p>

<p>Anything this government can do to save taxpayers from having to pay out £40 billion a year in Gordon Browns bribes of Working and Child Tax credits is good to me.</p>

<p>The blatant lying by David Cameron &amp; George Osborne on Child Tax Credits should have the same devestating impact to them as tuition fees did to Nick Clegg.</p>

<p>What blatant lying?</p>

<p>George Osborne has  taken a deserved  hammering in the Commons today....He is not as smart as he thinks he is.He thought he was untouchable after the elction victory........the whole policy was based on misinformation......the PM assured everyone on live TV this wouldn't happen.....then he was elected and has tried to implement the very policy he said wouldn't happen.</p>

<p>From what I saw he did very well - what were you watching?</p>

<p>He is very deceptive and cunning - if you check his record.</p>

<p>Time this boil was lanced.</p>

<p>Do you mean deceiving?</p>

<p>Career politicians are simply BAD news for politics.</p>

<p>Hopefully this one has found his poll tax.</p>

<p>Clearly, the sudden, substantial reduction in the spending power of a large section of society does not make economic sense, let alone internal political sense.  So we have to look for another reason why.  The answer is that the government is spending huge sums on secret projects such as stratospheric aerosol geoengineering.  So to complain about being asked to think again as being undemocratic is hypocrisy of indecent proportion.<br/>The purpose of such secret projects is to keep wealth and power in the hands of the few.  So the thing is, will the Lords ask the government to re-think this also?  Not in public obviously.<br/>I have just asked the government to rethink it, because India is about to introduce a new energy technology.  The economic sense of letting the east beat the west to it is something that requires urgent re-thinking.  Suppressed technologies can now do what the widespread availability of electricity did in the last century, but on a scale that can generate far more wealth, but spread more evenly.  It is lunacy for the elite to try to hang on to shrinking wealth amid environmental and political upheaval.  The future of humanity can be transformed when we have a surplus of energy.</p>

<p>Another worked-up non-drama by Kirkup who thinks he's some kind of political analyst, signifying nothing.</p>

<p>WTF cares?</p>

<p>Kirkup - an analyst?</p>

<p>Kockup ?</p>

<p>What do you expect. That is the way British politics are organized.<br/>A totally undemocratic voting system for parliament.<br/>A bunch of unelected peers in the upper house and<br/>and unelected president, the queen.<br/>But the British people seem to like it that way, because they do nothing about it,</p>

<p>So, if UK public were able to vote, what do you think they would vote for?</p>

<p>Yeah???</p>

<p>Four  million voted UKIP and got one MP!</p>

<p>One too many.</p>

<p>UKIP are the true BRITISH.</p>

<p>What wit! I bet you think you're good in bed as well. Prat!</p>

<p>Ask your wife.</p>

<p>Common decency and common sense prevailed in the House of Lords last night whilst Osborne the creator of this mess was left totally embarrassed &amp; humiliated which was a joy to behold as he has tried on too many occasions to persecute the poor &amp; needy in our Society to fulfil is sadistic lust to force through his Nasty Party's Vindictive Ideology.</p>

<p>You would like to think he was totally embarrassed and humiliated. As much as i dislike the 'posh' boys they are made of stronger mettle than you suggest. He will suck it up. Plan for the well deserved kicking these unelected toffs deserve and , hopefully, de-construct the monster that is 'tax credits'. One couldn't have devised a worst way to encourage work and self sufficiency. Pleased to see the plan for individuals to register to vote got passed. What is wrong with the individual taking responsibility for their vote and  not, as it has been, the responsibility of some one else to cast their vote for them. Really the left infantilize the individual.</p>

<p>Yes, hopefully this deceptive fool will fall on his own sword.</p>

<p>Psst, while you were asleep, Labour became The Nasty Party.</p>

<p>About fifty years ago.</p>

<p></p>

<p>'Persecute the poor &amp; needy'?!! . Don't make me laugh!!</p>

<p>What the Tax-Credit scandal has shown us is just how duplicitous and <br/>wasteful governments are with our tax-money. I even discovered my <br/>builder and his wife were receiving them!!! She works in local <br/>government and he's certainly not cheap to employ!! That they were even <br/>receiving them in the first place was a disgrace!!</p>

<p>So just cut it out at the top end, not the bottom.</p>

<p>Because this mad scheme makes it  beneficial for recipients to be at the bottom and remain there  in perpetuity. This 'free' money inhibits freedom. Why move off a low paid job subsidising the employer as well as the employee when to improve your wages means you lose free money and let us not kid ourselves for most, lots of free time. Like a drug, it literally is a fix.</p>

<p>Any employer will pay te least possible for an employee.<br/>There has to be a minimum or workers might as well move to Bangladesh.</p>

<p>There has to be a cut off point where some are worse off- there is in any system.</p>

<p>It will regulate itself over time.</p>

<p>Better the worse off are those with money to spare.</p>

<p>That would help, but it explains why the 'poor' could still always enjoy  all the perks like SKY TV and smart phones etc!!</p>

<p>Someone has to buy them or Capitalism collapses.</p>

<p>Your place at that conservative think tank 'screw the poor' looking a bit shaky now.</p>

<p>Whereas yours on the "Eat the Rich"  think tank is solid!</p>

<p>:)))))</p>

<p>So many single parents. . WHY???</p>

<p>MARRIAGE IS DEAD.</p>

<p>The Law Lords Killed Marriage in 2006.</p>

<p>This is what David Cameron will have to address and reverse if his crusade to mend a ‘BROKEN SOCIETY’ is to succeed. . .  The House of Lords finally destroyed any incentive for a man to find happiness in Marriage in 2006.</p>

<p>I couldn’t advise any son of mine that marriage was a wise course of action to take. . . There has been great dearth of offspring from the intelligentsia ever since then.</p>

<p>"Melissa was entitled to £5 million of her former husband's assets after just two years and nine months of marriage, no children, the Law Lords ruled. Five Law Lords agreed that the benchmark for division should be equal shares - save in certain circumstances - no matter how short the marriage. They said that to achieve fairness at the end of a marriage, the courts should look to three main considerations: financial needs, compensation, and equal sharing."</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_v_Miller" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p>

<p>Let me get this right. A single parent can earn up to £25000 and still claim tax credit. That's more than double what I earn in my pension. Can I claim tax credit?<br/>Is the world utterly mad???</p>

<p>Yes!  Tax Credits for pensioners - UK has  the lowest pensions in  Western Europe  -  time for a revolt!</p>

<p>We should abolish the second chamber and introduce proportional representation so as to have all parties represented in parliament according to votes, each party being able to compromise in order to reach a decision which will be the best for the country.</p>

<p>This idea has only been kicked around for 80 years!</p>

<p>I have  not heard much about it and I'm 93 years old. Please give a few facts.</p>

<p>' each party being able to compromise in order to reach a decision which will be the best for the country'</p>

<p>Meanwhile, back here on planet Earth.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Don't give up too easily. No decision is better than the wrong decision.</p>

<p>The Government did not have the Tax Credit Cuts in their Manifesto and Mr Cameron when asked in the Campaign said he would not hit the poorest with Tax Credit Cuts. Mr Cameron lied to the public.</p>

<p>A statutory instrument will not allow amendments so the House of Commons did not fully review this proposal. Why? The Tory Government knew it would lose a Commons vote on an amendment (only 6 Tory MPs needed to vote no). That is why it was not put in the Finance Bill as it should have been to send it through the Lords.</p>

<p>In the end the Lords will allow a modified form through (Frank Field,Heidi Allen and Tim Farron good work). The Lords exists to revise bad laws, the Church of England spoke out. Mr Cameron promised the poorest would not suffer at the General Election.  Now will Mr Cameron upset the Queen by creating new peers who have funded the Tory Party or worse.</p>

<p>Do I see a glint of silver from Mr Cameron's mouth, yes a silver spoon. The Tory Party is not the Party of the working family, actions speak loader than words.</p>

<p>Maybe Osborne should take a look at armed forces disability pensions.  I know someone who was medically discharged with a knee injury but can still cycle hundreds of miles a week and earns a salary substantially above the national average while drawing a pension of several hundred pounds a month in his mid-40s.  Clearly not disabled by anyone's definition and no loss of earnings compared to remaining in the forces.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, I fully support our armed forces' right to the best equipment and proper provision for health and welfare during and after their service, but this is simply taking the p*ss.</p>

<p>Cameron' s moment of truth - has he the guts to tackle Tony's Packed Cronies in the  Lords  or not?</p>

<p> As he is one of them, (heir to Blair)  it is clear that Ollie Cameron  will huff puff and bluster - and as usual do nothing.</p>

<p>Another fine mess  Stan  Osborne has dropped him in!</p>

<p>'...wage bloody political war to pass the tax credits package as written. Make this a point of fundamental political principle, the defining battle of the Parliament and his career'</p>

<p>Just one problem with that: Osborne and Cameron were hoping to get this out of the way quickly, so that us halfwits in the electorate would have plenty of time to forget their mendacity in the runup to the 2015 election, and their doublespeak in presenting themselves as the workers party while making workers worse off, and their abuse of procedure to try and ram this through outside a finance bill.</p>

<p>They hardly want this embarrassment to form the defining feature of this Parliament.</p>

<p>It looks like political positioning. Push for the most extreme option and then settle for the compromise. It will be easier to move towards full withdrawal next time. He simultaneously appears fiscally tough and magnanimous. A master tactician at work.</p>

<p>We can't afford our welfare state anymore and Browns hosing of tax payer money on the working poor to secure votes was as insidious as it was damaging. It's a bold politician that attempts to roll back those bribes and he has in fact played an absolute blinder. Any future recessionary failures can be placed firmly at the feet of the Lords/Labour/Libdems whilst Osborne walks free  of blame-yet, if the economy picks up he will be seen as the man who made all the right changes. Win win. </p>

<p>But this makes Osborne look weak. Hardly the strong man who has judged the mood of the country.</p>

<p>I do agree that Osborne is both cunning and highly deceptive.</p>

<p>We can't afford our "Welfare State" because of the vast numbers of non contributing immigrant  freeloaders and their very large and growing families we keep allowing into the country - together with their Health Tourist relatives by the thousand.</p>

<p>Plenty of homegrown freeloaders as well, in case it had escaped your notice.</p>

<p>Maybe - another reason why we don't need to import any more  - particularly when "freeloading" and having as many babies as physically possible  is part of their 'culture'!</p>

<p>An interesting take on events, but I am not convinced.</p>

<p>yes, nor me.</p>

<p>What the Tax-Credit scandal has shown us is just how duplicitous and wasteful governments are with our tax-money. I even discovered my builder and his wife were receiving them!!! She works in local government and he's certainly not cheap to employ!! That they were even receiving them in the first place was a disgrace!! Thank God we dumped Gordon Brown! </p>

<p>... and hire a million extra teat-suckers we didn't need.  People who could otherwise have been plumbers, baristas, builders, and generally filled the 'jobs British people won't do'.</p>

<p>How many years was the Guardian jobs section 100+ pages every week.  Top to bottom with 'world class councils' hiring.</p>

<p>One of the first things he did was have a massive extra tax-grab on all businesses. We used to pay a year behind all the time, not as you go as we have to now. That's another thing that made the effects of the recession worse.</p>

<p>THE COLOURS OF LIFE.</p>

<p> Fate comes in many colours,<br/>And always takes us by surprise.<br/>Just when we think our life is planned,<br/>It finds a new disguise.<br/>It dresses up in melancholy,<br/>To trap us when we’re down,<br/>Then it wears its cloak of ecstasy,<br/>Or even plays the clown.</p>

<p>On good days when the sky is blue,<br/>Our cares seem far away.<br/>With sunshine any fears we have,<br/>Are all kept right at bay.<br/>Then storm clouds come from nowhere,<br/>And bring our darkest frown,<br/>Is this Atropos latest tapestry,<br/>Or simply nature’s evening gown?</p>

<p>Sometimes we feel the deck is stacked,<br/>Must the Gods always have their say?<br/>Our well laid plans get sabotaged ,<br/>It’s just life’s cruel uncaring way.<br/>We strive once more to rescue parts,<br/>We feel deserve another hearing.<br/>This time our cloak of rectitude,<br/>Keeps our strategy unerring.</p>

<p>When we reach the final page,<br/>Of our life’s great almanac,<br/>We realise what’s written there,<br/>Means there is no going back.<br/>So take each day and use it well,<br/>It’s just one of life’s great adventures.<br/>Don’t expect to get a second chance,<br/>To present your last debenture.</p>

<p>Welcome to BookNet Online Order Collection Service for distributors.  A service dedicated to you.</p>

<p></p>

<p>I meant, post the title and ISBN here.<br/>But she's just another poster here who likes you.</p>

<p>We've known of each other for years now. Few people know as much about tuberculosis as she and I.</p>

<p>Dreadful doggerel.<br/>Vanity published.</p>

<p>Harsh - but very fair.</p>

<p>Some of us foresee life's major fails<br/>Others, like Redwood singing in Wales<br/>proudly proclaim their lack of skill<br/>through non-scanning, forced-rhyming dogger-ill</p>

<p>This is a major problem with the whole state benefits system, the management of it.<br/>Far too many people in public services administrative roles take the view, "well it's not my money" which of course it is, and their only raison d'etre is to pick up their monthly salary cheque.</p>

<p>They all have a naive view that those with 'wealth' are all like 'Apple' and just sat on enormous bags of cash. Whereas the reality of course, is more like Volkswagon, Tescos or TalkTalk. Liquidity can evaporate.</p>

<p>The Lords may well have done Mr Osborne a favour. Was he really going to give people a £1300 income cut for Christmas? Did he really not grasp the stupidity of the timing?? The LAST thing he needs is the 'return of the 'Nasty Party''.<br/>Mr Osborne will shout at the Lords and probably threaten them; that will get him nowhere-the Upper House is the wrong target. Massive income cuts will generate far more public interest-and trouble for the government-than constitutional change...</p>

<p>Rather than scream at the Lords, Mr Osborne should calm down and adjust the timetable for the cuts, bringing them in gradually as the Living Wage goes up. <br/>He might find quite a few people would join him in pressurising employers to pay the Living Wage. There is no need for legislation to enforce that, yet. <br/>A joint campaign by Mr Osborne and the lower-paid people in our society seems extremely unlikely this morning, but it is IS possible if he learns from this debacle. <br/>If, however, he picks the wrong target again, the government will find it very hard to recover...</p>

<p>We have the second largest legislature in the world, a small island of 60m people, it is an unnecessary expense and must be reduced. The second chamber should be wholly elected and restricted to 30% the size of the commons.</p>

<p>Tax credits were a labour ruse to bribe the electorate and grew out of control during the Brown era.</p>

<p>Having said that, Osborne got it wrong, the adjustment was to be applied without enough examination of how it might affect working families, and no government can take away something that already exists, it would be political suicide.</p>

<p>The Lords is an anachronism in the 21st century and needs to be re-built from the ground up on a democratic basis, the idea that Danny Alexander is now Lord something or other as compensation for being a failed politician is just plain stupidity. <br/>He is, at the same time taking a board position with an international bank, so the lesson is, fail at what you do and join two gravy trains as your reward.</p>

<p>I have one suggestion for Osborne. Give 9 months notice of the cessation of child allowances for all new births, the country does not need a population explosion nor the potential cultural strife that it might engender.</p>

<p>We urgently need more births lol!  We have an ageing population, meaning services will be growing increasingly strained.  There are only a few ways to increase the size of the workforce; one way means working ever-later in life, the other means increasing the younger population.</p>

<p>In most constituencies it's possible for a person to see his/her MP in a surgery within one month of trying.<br/>Do you have any idea how difficult it is for a US citizen to see his/her Congressman?<br/>The House of Lords is too big, but the Commons isn't.</p>

<p>If, thanks to Osborne, our money machine is working well and workers generally are better paid etc. by the time of the next election, Osborne will deservedly become prime minister.</p>

<p>Huge debt. Deficit not cut as promised. Loss of AAA rating. Weak growth. Steals watered down Labour ideas. Tries to take money from the working poor. The man is a genius.</p>

<p>You and your facts! Stop it... and get on message. No help for poor people, more tax breaks for the well off. Here, try on this tin foil hat. See - things are already making better sense.</p>

<p>Labour ideas.............. f hilarious...</p>

<p>Have you ever had a proper job?</p>

<p>Yes, thanks.</p>

<p>Space cadet?</p>

<p>So far it doesn't look good - the Pasty Tax all over again!</p>

<p>George has come across are a bit heartless. Never  good for a politician.</p>

<p>Well Osborne and Cameron lost and now Cameron is having a hissy fit so I suppose Osborne will be having one too. Cameron wants to change the constitution, nothing like changing the playing field when you don't win to show what a spoilt brat you are.</p>

<p>Just as he will change the rules in the Referendum to suit the inners on the fly.</p>

<p>How did Labour and the LibDems manage to pack the House of Lords with Peers and outnumber the Conservatives 2 to 1?</p>

<p>By governing for 13 years.</p>

<p>Good point.</p>

<p>Tony's Cronies - remember? Cash for  Peerages- remember?</p>

<p>Clearly the Conservatives are well behind the curve on this and should learn a few lessons from Helen's beloved Labour Party.</p>

<p>Same way Cameron will. Appoint them.</p>

<p>Hardly an option, with 850 peers already, another 150 would be an absolute joke, instead of just the current farce.<br/>The mistake that Cameron and Osborne made was they expected that with an overall majority in the Commons, they could get their legislation through.<br/>They didn't bargain for the Lords to break all the long standing conventions that has allowed the Lords to continue in it's present form since 1911 and long before that.</p>

<p>"  One thing is clear: he needs to kill the Lords' tax credit timetable. Three million people being told you're making them worse off one year into the Parliament is one thing. The same cuts falling a year before the 2020 general election is quite another."</p>

<p>And there you have it .. a clear statement of the 'principle' Cameron claims is involved.</p>

<p>Tragic that this is the closest we get to political principles.</p>

<p>Screw em, but don't screw em  close to an election.<br/>It must be nice to have principles.</p>

<p>Party of Workers?  Yes if you are on £100K  pa plus.  Osborne always appears to be sneering and smirking in any photograph.</p>

<p>Perhaps the dolt adheres to the principle emblazoned on your avatar  Alfred E Neumann's Tee Shirt  "What ME Worry".</p>

<p>it seems odd to make swingeing tax credit cuts affecting some of the most vulnerable in our society while allowing absurdly generous limits on child allowance which benefit even the well-heeled middle classes.  we live on a very small very crowded island with one of the highest projected birth rates in europe. our public services are struggling to cope. there are not enough beds in hospitals or places in schools. why then do we continue to divert vast amounts of tax payers money to subsidise people to have children? if osborne wants to balance the books- and he should- that is where his axe should fall first.</p>

<p>Child Benefit for first two only, along with Child Tax Credit on the same principle, paid for no more than two children.</p>

<p>Two children per woman or two per man?  Not the same thing at all in certain invasive 'faith communities'.</p>

<p>It is the same thing.<br/>Unless you think that the women would remain single and childless all their lives.</p>

<p>Err, no .... If the state paid for the father's first two children it would only ever pay for two children.  You assume that cultural ingrained polygamy would cease.</p>

<p>Osborne like Cameron have failed yet again to listen to the public, now they are plotting to get their revenge on the "unelected" lords, if not so serious it would be a joke,  in this country we are being controlled and led by the unelected, EU which has been fine with both Cameron and Osborne, time for them both to go but if they are serious about "saving taxpayers money" how about slashing the foreign Aid budget and getting us Out of the EU club, that would be  a fine start.</p>

<p>And reform the lords into an elected upper chamber, one proviso, the Elected Lords or Senators would have not to  belong to any Political Party, they must be independent.</p>

<p>I dunno, to me the Lords do better unelected - compare them to the Commons!</p>

<p>I'm afraid that would be impossible.<br/>Anyone sufficiently qualified to serve would have formed political opinions.<br/>Membership or not of a party is no indicator of political allegiance.</p>

<p>True but at least there would be no overt  Party Loyalty per se</p>

<p>Wouldn't that be worse?<br/>At least with party members you can take bias into account.</p>

<p>Unlike Cameron , Osborn will not chicken out and do a U turn , get used to it scroungers .</p>

<p>Hear hear.<br/>Let's get rid of those scrounging, greedy employers who don't pay proper wages because the taxpayer subsidises them by paying their employees in Tax Credits.</p>

<p>Dont have to pay any wages............ get it manufactured in China.</p>

<p>Quite right , more power to Osborn .</p>

<p>Quite right.<br/>Living wage before you cut Tax Credits.</p>

<p>Notice the whinging of single mothers wheeled out by the media, note they never ask these women who have multiple kids and the fathers.</p>

<p>The fat obese female BBC presenter on Radio 5 just lied. A woman caller on earlier admitted her ex partner paid NOTHING to her kids as he was unemployed. Yet the female presenter claimed just now he WAS paying, the female caller never ever said that.</p>

<p>The BBC are evil and determined to pump lies out on a daily basis.</p>

<p>As opposed to Telegraph lies! :D</p>

<p>What does body shape have to do with anything? Typical of the nasty, judgemental people you get around here.</p>

<p>As opposed to be judgemental about people who have worked hard and made money......... ?</p>

<p>BBC lies are part of our national life! Then again you shoiuld have seen Jin Snow and his Lefty chum ganging up on the Tory on C4 Marxist News last night!</p>

<p>Why don't C4 just call it the "Jon Snow Multiculti Marxist News Show'?</p>

<p>So... you agree with the BBC presenter and disagree with the member of the public... and your conclusion is the BBC are lying (by confirming your opinion)</p>

<p>I think you need to think that one through again, it makes you look just a tiny bit silly.</p>

<p>Even the BBC admits to its Leftist bias  - so who is silly?</p>

<p>The Tories are incompetent morons. I don't think these halfwits will last till 2020.</p>

<p>Who would replace them , Corbyns clowns ?</p>

<p>Corbyn will be gone long before 2020.</p>

<p>I'm not sure I can face another tedious drawn out parade of unelectable non-entities (aka Labour leadership contest) just yet</p>

<p>I do like to see deluded lefties scrabbling for the next messiah....</p>

<p>Before I retired one guy who I worked with was receiving tax credits, he had a weekly opportunity to work overtime which he refused. He refused work overtime because it would affect his tax credits.<br/>He was of course happy for his collogues to work overtime, and in effect for him to take from them the extra tax which they subsequently paid into the system.</p>

<p>What is the answer to such a situation?. Was he doing the best for his family?. Or, was he in part living off the backs of other people. Obviously, situations are different for different people. It does however beg the question, how many people in receipt of such benefits are playing the system !.</p>

<p>If he needed to work overtime to make a living wage then his employer was at fault. If he had been paid a proper wage he would not be eligible for Tax Credits.<br/>Osborne's problem is not that he wants to get rid of Tax Credits. That's a good thing to do. But he hasn't implemented a policy that would force greedy and incompetent employers to pay proper wages before the Tax Credits disappear.</p>

<p>His, and my employer was the local council. We were both employed as street sweepers.. And I can assure you he was in receipt of tax credits! <br/>Is my local council a greedy and incompetent employer? How much is a proper wage?. MPs think that 70 odd grand a year is reasonable for what according to Michael Riffkind, is little more than a part time job.</p>

<p>Why wasn't the other sweeper claiming tax credits?</p>

<p>None of that changes my point.<br/>A fair day's work for a fair day's pay.</p>

<p>A cop out.</p>

<p>"Is my local council a greedy and incompetent employer? How much is a proper wage?. MPs think that 70 odd grand a year is reasonable for what according to Michael Riffkind, is little more than a part time job."</p>

<p>No cop out.<br/>Yes.<br/>Enough to live on and raise family.</p>

<p>How much is enough? 13-15 grand or 70? Remember a loaf of bread costs us all the same price.</p>

<p>Must  go now. I have to see if there is any fish on the use today shelf at Tesco...Not joking</p>

<p>Enough is the amount needed to pay the average rent in the area, and buy the average weekly food basket in the area (we don't all pay the same price for food in every area), and to provide light and heat and clothes.<br/>If we stop paying Tax Credits, and employers don't pay proper wages, then people won't be able to work, and they'll just go back on to the unemployment statistics.<br/>This will increase the welfare bill and increase welfare dependency.<br/>Civil society depends on employers paying a living wage.</p>

<p>Hardly a cop out .... it is exactly what lots of Tory MP's are saying and exactly what Osborne claims he will now do.</p>

<p>Interesting that.  I know plenty of hugely rewarded lawyers who won't work for no incremental reward either.  Perhaps it's quite common.</p>

<p>The DT article on the death of three men in the blowing up of more of Palmyra uses the word 'executions'.<br/>Can't someone teach these stupid sub-editors that it isn't a f*cking  execution? It's a murder.<br/>Get it right!</p>

<p>Agreed!<br/>May we now have "problem" and NOT "Issue", "contact" and NOT "reach out", "victim" and NOT "survivor"? There are many more. .Other readers may contribute as many as they like...</p>

<p>Osborne has become the Mandleson of the Tory Party. Seen as cunning and clever at first, he is now shown to be the same self-seeking, tax avoiding incompetent as his erstwhile hero. Even now cloistered with his idol, he plots his rise to oblivion.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>That's right, we should just tax bankers' bonuses to get rid of the deficit, and bankers' wives, and bankers' houses, and  and and oh yes print money and spend it on infrastructure.</p>

<p>Easy.</p>

<p>The Lords may have done the government a favour and prevented the tax credit cuts being hung round its neck throughout this parliament in the way that Thatcher and Major never recovered from the poll tax and Black Wednesday respectively.</p>

<p>As Mitterrand said, social entitlements are untouchable. The people who pay the money don't notice ( because it's part of their general tax burden) whereas the people who lose it do, and scream foul.</p>

<p>One sob story in the media trumps a thousand earnest economic analyses of the nation's finances.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it have made sense to "synchronise" the reduction in tax credits with the rise in the minimum wage? Whilst I feel for people who are working hard but cannot make ends meet I do not see why the tax payer should subsidise their employers. Any business who cannot pay a living wage should seriously look at their business model.</p>

<p>It would indeed have been very sensible... and is exactly what their lordships have told the government to do.</p>

<p>Osborne wanted a fight. He hoper he could bully the Lords and got a bloody nose for his pains. Now Cameron wants to have a big public fight with the lords .. over a topic where the public agree with the lords.</p>

<p>The idea that the lords are evil for suggesting you get your policies in synch is not likely to prove a great rallying cry.  (Except with the fanatics.)  Now is it an action likely to find support amongst the establishment that have successfully blocked Lords reform for decades.</p>

<p>Lots of noise, and empty vessels make the most noise.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Two things:<br/>First - there's also no evidence that tax credits don't subsidise employers either.  The only way to get that evidence would be to remove all tax credits and see if wages rise.  <br/>Second - SOME people who get tax credits are working taxpayers themselves.  Some tax credit claimants are unemployed.  Some have never worked a day in their life.  Others have worked in horrible, low-paid jobs and only been able to survive through tax credits.  <br/>Tax credit claimants cover a huge cross-section of society (including decently-paid workers receiving help with childcare costs).  This is the problem with reforming the system (and it is broken and requires reform).  Whichever decision is made will negatively affect someone who has relied on tax credits.</p>

<p>Since the government is perfectly content to have unelected people in Brussels over ruling the democratic will of the people of this country, I'm not sure that they ought to be quite as upset by unelected peers doing it.</p>

<p>The unellected Lords,  with its pack of godsquad Bishops, are generally loved by Tories.  Now the Tories have been defeated and are in a huff and threatening to have more unellected Lords.  Democracy in action?  </p>

<p>Extraordinary. A bunch of insufferable Tory monarchists who voted against the removal of hereditary peers now bleating about democracy because the suprastructure of the Establishment which exists to protect its interest and continue its privileges whoever is in government has come out on the side of the working poor and called Hameron and Gideon out on their pre-election lies.</p>

<p>What's not to like?<br/>Old Ham Cheeks is reaping what he sowed......Liars should never prosper.....</p>

<p>"Worse, this goes to competence. Even those who do not warm to Mr Osborne acknowledge his skill at the great game of politics. It is in large part this grandmaster status that makes him the favourite to succeed David Cameron. Simply, people don't love Mr Osborne, but they think he's good at what he does."</p>

<p>The only one's with this view are the Telegaf and Conservative shills.  Meanwhile, in the real world, we all see Mr Osborne for what he is: a smary, smirky little man, with an odiousness to match Iain Duncan-Smith (which takes some doing!).  No wonder Mr Johnson is looking so happy today!</p>

<p>Osborne  is a shrewd politician  - could this all be part of a cunning plan.</p>

<p>Is  it possible that this is just  the  politicians’ usual trick of expectation  management? <br/>Tell the  voters that benefits are going to be cut by  50% to get everyone worried  - so  that they then  more cheerfully tolerate the 10% cut that was always intended.</p>

<p>Could it also be a clever attempt to get the Lords to instigate its own reform? It's long overdue -  it surely can’t be good for an unelected elite to block the will of an<br/>elected house On the other hand 150 new Tory peers would be a nice result for<br/>the Government.</p>

<p>The third alternative is that Osborne is not as clever as everyone thought.</p>

<p>Its only his friends in the media who think Osborne is clever.</p>

<p>He's as clever and financially astute as Brown.</p>

<p>Plead the third, George!</p>

<p>Right third time.</p>

<p>Lots of evidence for alternative three.</p>

<p>The claim that  anyone would loose 50% is pure fiction.  Child Benefit changes affect no existing parents at all, Then working tax credits are so complex it is difficult to work out but most would loose no more than 5% after tax allowance changes and higher minimum pay are taken into account</p>

<p>To clarify   - I know next to nothing about the complexities of  tax credits or the welfare benefits in general.</p>

<p>I made up the figures of 50% and 10%  to illustrate a general point about expectation management - they are not  real numbers.</p>

<p>'Lose'. Not 'loose', Schoolboy error.</p>

<p>John, that is beneath you.</p>

<p>Was it weak spelling skills or a typographical error?</p>

<p>Schoolboy after a comma?</p>

<p>Or, has schoolboy become a noun?</p>

<p>Easy isn't it.</p>

<p>I would say schoolboy has always been, and will always be, a noun!</p>

<p>In the context in question, it's an adjective.</p>

<p>Exactly - why would anyone refer to something out of context.</p>

<p>Great. The whole country will move to minimal wage jobs on minimal hours per week and start taking tax credits. But remember you need to pump out 2 kids every 10 years otherwise you loose all the money.</p>

<p>2 every 10 years is chicken feed to the Muzzis!</p>

<p>'Lose', not 'loose'. Better head back to the Daily Mail. They wouldn't notice.</p>

<p>A thank you to the appalling Michael Fallan MP (shame on the voters of Sevenoaks), for by his malign incompetence he has alerted me to the rally in support of Sgt Blackman to be held at 11:30 Wednesday in Parliament Square.</p>

<p>I shall be catching the train to support a better man than any sitting in the Commons or Lords. I would urge you to do the same.</p>

<p>If I could I most certainly would - I will be there in spirit.</p>

<p>George Osborne lost. He should go. However, I blame for the latest fiasco the unthinking or unknowing Conservative MPs who went along with Osborne's policy on three occasions.</p>

<p>Much was made (in the House of Lords debate) of the fact that the House of Commons had voted by a majority on three occasions to support the Conservative policy to cut tax credits, the last such occasion being last week. I worry about this because I wonder if on, say, the first occasion, that every Conservative MP knew what he or she was voting for. Maybe they all knew a bit more on the second occasion: I can't be sure. What I am sure about is that many more knew what they were voting for on the third occasion, last week. Certainly Heidi Allen MP (South Cambridgeshire) knew what she was voting for, though she spoke against the policy. Did they all just do what they were told to do? My worry stems from when I was a Cambridgeshire County Councillor. I knew for a fact then that many County Councillors did not know what they were voting for (or against): they did what they were told to do. The same applied when I was an East Cambridgeshire District Councillor. The same may apply to Soham (Cambridgeshire) Town Council, of which I am now a member. I know for a fact that I do not know all about what I am voting for (or against) at the meetings. There is a vital need for all elected representees at all levels to know what they are voting for (or against). Simples. Or is it?</p>

<p>The Tory MPs knew full well what they were voting for. They began to make backtracking noises not long after Question Time a couple of weeks ago when it became apparent that marginal seats would become very high risk. Pure self interest as always.</p>

<p>I believe that it was in June when they first voted for the policy, JB. Sheep to the slaughter?</p>

<p>Why does the Telegraph employ Kirkup. He is totally clueless <br/>Child Tax Credit changes come in in 2017. They do not effect any children born prior to April 2017. Any children born prior to then still get child tax credit even if it is 15 children. After that date only the First two children will get tax credits (Existing children remain unaffected. If though a woman had say 3 children  prior to April 2017 and then had as fourth after April 2017 the fourth child would not get child benefit</p>

<p>Not true.<br/>If doesn't matter when the children were born it matters when the claim is made. If a claim is made after April 2017 only two children will be considered.<br/>After April 2017 a family presently claiming child tax credits has no incentive to better themselves as if they fall on hard times after six months off tax credits their claim will be seen as new and only two children will be considered no matter when they were born.</p>

<p>Yes so no current families are effected. Why should taxpayer bee required to support unlimited numbers of children?</p>

<p>It depends on your definition of current family. You stated "They do not effect any children born prior to April 2017. Any children born prior to then still get child tax credit even if it is 15 children".<br/>This is not true.</p>

<p>Yes it is. You do not understand the changes</p>

<p>Please explain then Bob</p>

<p>Osborne is a psychopath. You can see it in his eyes, he's probably committed more crimes than Peter Sutcliffe. He sits in the commons during pmqs like he's got a turnip shoved up his botty.</p>

<p>Chris Grayling doing the rounds this morning only shining more light on Osborne's absolute Horlicks. <br/>High stakes trial and error brought to you by incompetent toffs.</p>

<p>Why should the tax payer in effect top up the wages paid by low wage employers via tax credits ?<br/>When that cretin Brown brought them in low wage employers rubbed their hands with glee. <br/>And these credits are also available to anyone of 485m people that can come here thanks to EU open borders. So we now subsidise;<br/>Czech low wage amployees<br/>Polish low wage employees <br/>Latvian low wage employees<br/>Estonian low wage employees<br/>Hungarian low wage employees<br/>Romanian low wage employees<br/>Bulgarian Low wage employees<br/>Lithuanian low wage employees<br/>Portugese low wage employees etc<br/>Vote OUT</p>

<p>Why? Because poverty wages alone would result in ill health, homelessness and increases in crime on a massive scale. Stop being so bloody selfish for a change and recognise that capital's strongarm grip on our society and economy is increasingly damaging for all of us, not just the poor. </p>

<p>Osborne to be wild.</p>

<p>Tories got 36% of vote in the General election, not much of a mandate is it?</p>

<p>Around 27% of the electorate.</p>

<p>So their 31% representation in the Lords is about right...</p>

<p>Comes to something when the Lords is more representative of the country's politics than the Commons!</p>

<p>What relevance is that when we have a FPTP system?</p>

<p>It demonstrates that barely 1 in 4 people wanted this government.</p>

<p>Tells you that the FPTP system isn't fit for purpose.</p>

<p>What percentage the UK electorate did the Brussels commission get?</p>

<p>Lovely to see that smarmy look wiped off Gideon's mug - another almighty fcuk from the toffs.</p>

<p>At least businesses all over the country won't have to offer their workers a pay rise now, thanks to the Lefties.</p>

<p>They wouldn't anyway.</p>

<p>Not now.</p>

<p>The Tories ALWAYS make the SAME mistake when it comes to attempting to undo the socialist ideological excesses of the Labour party.</p>

<p>£4.6 billion is a great deal of taxpayers money BUT in the greater scheme of things it is a lower priority when you look at the issues that would bring in far more each year, for example: £35 billion in tax evasion by Corporatism and the uber rich as well as the highly unpopular £12 billion in overseas aid.</p>

<p>Instead of listing and detailing the priorities they are going to tackle so that people can see that they are  working fairly by addressing the higher priority issues first - their equally ideological zeal for undoing the mistakes of Labour gets the better of them and they make them a higher priority.</p>

<p>NO!  By all means tackle Tax Credits and other Labour party ideological excesses BUT do so within a defined prioritised list and tackle the largest wastes of money in descending order of priority.</p>

<p>This way everyone can see what you are doing, why and when - a much more likely strategy for not only recouping larger sums of money first but more importantly getting the electorate on board by showing FAIRNESS and OBJECTIVITY.</p>

<p>Yep, many people struggle with the idea of cutting subsidies for the 'working poor' when we are in effect subsidizing the EU ascension states and other nations to the tune of £35bn a year.</p>

<p>Fairness? Tories? Waaaahhhaaaaaa.</p>

<p>They're starting to realise that the only reason they were tolerated for the last term was due to the effect of the Lib Dems on watering down their policies.</p>

<p>Does George Osborne share the same hair dye bottle with that Muppet who looks like one of the Thunderbirds puppets Andy Butt Face Burnham?</p>

<p>I really dislike Osborne but have difficulty explaining why. Could it be his 'arrogance'? I would not describe him, in the phrase Peter Hitchins uses for the present government', as a 'gutless worm'.</p>

<p>Didn't Cameron just recently put loads of lib dems into the Lords.</p>

<p>I am constantly gobsmacked at the merest thought that Enron Osborne could ever become PM, but then I take a close look (again) at the worthless lot of MPs in the lower house on either bench and realize that anything can happen.</p>

<p>So the sneaky bully has his eyes wiped by the House of Lords? This is the man who is supposedly going to replace Cameron? I think not, too big for his boots the pompous oaf has had his balloon popped!</p>

<p>Recent UK governments made strategic decisions to effectively end secure, well paid jobs with adequate pensions for the lower end of the labour market.</p>

<p>In the place of high skilled jobs (even though perhaps not the most globally competitive) we have retail and warehouse jobs on poverty wages with meagre (if any) pension provision, owned by corporations or individuals who (legally) choose not to pay the full tax commitment in the UK.</p>

<p>These unskilled jobs are so poorly paid that in-work benefits/tax credits are necessary to keep society from collapsing and to ensure governments can retain power.</p>

<p>The UK is locked in a spiral of retrenchment from an advanced economy as productively slides, technical expertise is lost and future pension commitments are massively underfunded. It is all hidden by the gloss of property bubbles fueled by dodgy overseas investors stashing their loot in London real estate</p>

<p>Not to forget 'brilliant' unemployment stats to dazzle the markets. Remember when Carney made job data the centre piece of his silly Forward Guidance? It was quietly shelved when stats exceeded his expectations. They are now showing up to have been artificially supported by government, amongst others by tax credits worth some £30bn this year.</p>

<p>Frightening how many people are happy to ditch democracy as soon as it delivers something they don't like.</p>

<p>The road to totalitarianism.</p>

<p>We did that when we gave away our sovereignty to the unelected EU commission.</p>

<p>So a promise not to change tax credits is reneged upon with indecent haste is alright in your eyes then?</p>

<p>A promise to reduce the welfare bill has been pushed back by an unelected bunch of bishops.</p>

<p>A very sad day for democracy. Still it keeps those that don't believe in democracy happy so what's the problem eh?</p>

<p>What, all 20 of them?  Lol, you protest too much, and in the wrong direction!</p>

<p>One wonders what some of the right wing commentators below think the role of the HoL actually is? <br/>Driving through draconian legislation which seriously impoversihes the already impoverished does have consequences :<br/>Law and order is the first - and with a much depleted police force, that problem is a serious one.   Moreover, hoewever much they may think they are buffered from the poor,  those that live in Chipping Norton and other rural idylls, will not be immune from, what I feel is,  a certain consequence of vindictive legislation <br/>Have we forgotten the poll tax? The difference today is - at leat Thatcher kept the fuzz and Army well paid and up to establishment levels - she knew they were the last line of defence for her nasty plans</p>

<p>So you're defending an unelected bunch of bishops and peers de-railing legislation from the elected House?</p>

<p>Not into that irritating democracy much then?</p>

<p>That is what an upper house is for - to tell the lower house when they've screwed up and need to pull their socks up.  Don't like it?  Well, support Lord's reform to become directly elected...</p>

<p>If someone miss sold a product or service t you, you would rightfully demand compensation / penalties.</p>

<p>If a political party lie in a general election to seize power, should they not also face penalties?</p>

<p>The Tories were elected on the promise of delivering £12b cuts to welfare to help eliminate Labour's deficit. Over 11m people voted for that.</p>

<p>It's a bloody nuisance this democracy lark isn't it?</p>

<p>The Conservatives said they would cut welfare, however they promised the British public that working tax credits would not be cut,</p>

<p>Once in office they decided to cut working tax credits, if the British public knew this was the case, think you find a lot of those 11m people would have not voted Tory.</p>

<p>If this was a product or service we would rightly be claiming mis selling and demand a refund, in this case new elections.</p>

<p>"It's a bloody nuisance this democracy lark isn't it?"</p>

<p>Yes, it is.  And Mr Osborne is waking up to that fact today!</p>

<p>Welfare dependence can never be a good thing - for those concerned, or for the country and its future.<br/>However, there is something fundamentally abhorrent in Osborne looking to balance the books on the backs of the lowest paid. Especially so considering the alternative sources of available revenue available.<br/>The undoubted constitutional issue arising from the Lords rebellion is particularly convenient for the government, and the age-old cherries ( i.e. unelected over elected)will no doubt be rolled out apace to support and secure the governments policy and position.<br/>Having made the decision - rightly or wrongly - I cannot see how Osborne or Cameron can possibly back down that much? Surely the same would show a worrying frailty unbecoming to any truly reforming government?</p>

<p>You must be talking about landowners.</p>

<p>George may have engineered this outcome with the Lords, if he plays his cards right with the easing of the worst effects of tax credits and a reform of the upper house, he will be seen as PM material for sure</p>

<p>James Kirkup at least gives us something upon which to comment other than diet scares.</p>

<p>Will this mean the end of the living wage?</p>

<p>The headline shows everything that is wrong in politics. It is not what is good for the country but what is good for an individual politician's career.</p>

<p>Tax credits exist because Gordon Brown wanted a way to control people and make everyone welfare dependent.</p>

<p>The correct solution was tax and corresponding spending cuts. As spendaholic socialists, Labour couldn't allow people that degree of freedom.</p>

<p>As a consequence, the state takes vast amounts of people's money, sloshes it around on salaries that shouldn't be needed to be paid and then gives some back - unevenly.</p>

<p>This is, by any accounting, absurd, expensive, inefficient and stupid. Scrap tax credits. Scrap child benefit. Shred the state, blend it, strain what remains. Radically cut taxes.</p>

<p>Funny that yesterday Lord Fowler claimed credit in the Lords for introducing tax credits (via their predecessor family credits).</p>

<p>And horror of horrors, make the NHS part-contributory by charging smallish affordable fees for GP visits etc.</p>

<p>A Why do some think they deserve a medal for going out to work to feed their children ? Why do some think it's their right to have more children than they can afford ? <br/>What's to stop some from having more children than they can support in the future ? <br/>Why should employers get away with paying low wages because they know the government will top them up ?<br/>What happens in another 10 years when the tax credit bill is 60/70/80 billion ?</p>

<p></p>

<p>There has been a lot of misreprentation of the changes by the BBC &amp; the Media. With Child tax credits no existing families are affected at all;</p>

<p>Not quite true Bob. <br/>Again there is a disincentive to work. <br/>After April 2017 should a couple with three children manage to earn enough to take them off child tax credits for six months that's it. If they fall on hard times and have to claim again the benefit will apply to first two children only.<br/>Why bother.</p>

<p>We need to understand the duplicity and deceit.</p>

<p>If there was a Bill introduced to make this change, then the Commons would have quite rightly demanded an assessment of the impact of the changes, but by using a statutory instrument,  no assessment was required.</p>

<p>The assumption by George Osborne was that the Lords would cowtow and pass the SI with the usual grumbling, and the changes would happen without any formal assessment of their impact. Then by 2020, three years would have passed and voters would have forgotten sufficiently to enable him to win the election.</p>

<p>The expectation was that Peers would be blackmailed into agreeing, even though under their rules SIs are not subject to the same restrictions as Bills, which prohibit them from rejecting financial measures.</p>

<p>Given the outright denial that the Tories would cut tax credits during the last election by David Cameron and that it was not in their manifesto either, to then use the device of an SI to evade scrutiny by the Commons and to railroad the Lords too, raises much bigger questions about George Osborne"s integrity.</p>

<p>In effect he deliberately tried to evade scrutiny and the democratic accountability of politicians, both to the electorate and to Parliament. Firstly by refusing to tell voters where the cuts in welfare spending would fall, then by rigging the parliamentary scrutiny process to prevent members of either House from getting an objective analysis of the impact on hard working families of his policies.</p>

<p>To describe this as a Stalinist attack on democracy seems to me to be an accurate assessment of George Osborne's politics and Tories need to think long and hard whether such a man is likely to become a monster if they make him their new leader when David Cameron retires.</p>

<p>What frustrates is that of all the SIs Brown used to force through malicious legislation, the Left were no where to be seen. It's tiresome seeing them froth and foam now about the use of an SI. Where were they when Labour were using them to force through awful law?</p>

<p>How would you go about in bringing down the UK budget deficit, 2nd highest in the G7, after Japan? Any government spending cuts will be loudly attacked from  all sides by groups with vested interests. As FinMin, Osborne is first in line of responsibility to cut spending. Does that make him a villain? So far he has almost halved the deficit inherited from Labour in 2009/10.</p>

<p>When government has to subsidise low-pay wages in order to impress markets with low unemployment stats, something is wrong. Business must pay decent living wages. To tax them and then hand out tax-credits to their employees sounds barmy to me.</p>

<p>There is no great constitutional principle at work here.</p>

<p>The Lords can only block a Money Bill for a month; but a Money Bill can be amended by the Commons. A Statutory Instrument cannot be amended by the Commons but can be blocked by the Lords at will.</p>

<p>Osborne chose to introduce this measure by Statutory Instrument rather than than Money Bill for political advantage in the Commons. He is reaping the consequences of a poor tactical decision.</p>

<p>Ah the irony, it takes a bunch of unelected toffs to finally have the moral decency to stick up for the working class. Osborne has had his cruel policy shoved down his throat on the world stage, it couldn't happen to a more deserving tosser.</p>

<p>They aren't stick up for the working class, free handouts encourage people to be lazy.</p>

<p>All the filth in the house of Frauds would vote for house prices rises to eternity and endless immigration, these are the 2 main factors that have now destroyed the working class.</p>

<p>The only laziness you're familiar with is the moronic stereotypes you apply to people you know nothing about.</p>

<p>You've never worked on a building site or in heavy industry getting your lazy hands dirty have you, where is its all ive done all my life and you claim to speak up for the working class, its middle class folk like yourself who haven't got a clue.</p>

<p>The working class need -</p>

<p>1. For immigration to be reversed<br/>2. For the state to stop propping up property prices and NIMBY's to clear off and die so land is free to build on thus houses prices ar 2 times salary and they don't have to work until they drop.<br/>3. Globalistion to be curtailed and trade barriers put up like they were up until the 1980s.<br/>4. Less laws so we have our freedom back.<br/>5. Slimmer women.</p>

<p></p>

<p>"a more deserving tosser."<br/>For trying to balance the Country's books? Corbynite by any chance?</p>

<p>For trying to do so on the backs of the poor and vulnerable. News flash for you, having some moral decency does not make you left or right, it makes you a human being.</p>

<p>I'm not poor or vulnerable, yet i cream it in from the tax/child credit scam.</p>

<p>It needs to end.</p>

<p>You're not poor or vulnerable, you're not even Simon.</p>

<p>?????????</p>

<p>Why do some think they deserve a medal for going out to work to feed their children ? Why do some think it's their right to have more children than they can afford ? <br/>What's to stop some from having more children than they can support in the future ? <br/>Why should employers get away with paying low wages because they know the government will top them up ?<br/>What happens in another 10 years when the tax credit bill is 60/70/80 billion ?<br/></p>

<p>To be fair im against ctc and wtc but employers most certainly won't be upping wages if these handouts end.</p>

<p>To suggest so is naive.</p>

<p>All Gidiot is doing is raising the minimum wage, do you glory in the fact more and more will be earning the minimum wage?</p>

<p>Charley,  perhaps they had the children whilst in a well paid jobs only to lose their job.</p>

<p>I know it will be a concept that is beyond you, but it's called moral decency. It is possible to have a society that is based on the principles of caring for those less fortunate than yourself.</p>

<p>Easy, balance it out to the positive by not wasting £100 billion+ on a bunch of irrelevant nuclear weapons that serves no purpose other than further enriching a bunch of billionaires.</p>

<p>Moral decency ? Having more children than you can support ? Not paying your staff a decent wage ? Morally decent ? Try irresponsible.</p>

<p>What do we cut after defence when that money has evaporated ?</p>

<p></p>

<p>This staff wages thing is a nonsense. Wages are set by the market. Employers hav eno way of knowing - or interest in - their employees beyond them doing their job.</p>

<p>Wages are set by the market. Employers pay what the market states.</p>

<p>Well, for a start foreign aid!<br/>There needs to be a better way of cutting tax credits: help the very needy and not those who have more children than they can afford, those who think that the money belongs to the government - it does not, it is the taxpayers.</p>

<p>Their Lordships will have only themselves to blame when the government curtails their powers. Meanwhile, Osborne should ignore this unconstitutional vote by the unelected "great and good" and press ahead with the long overdue and much needed rolling back of the mollycoddling and incentive killing welfare state.</p>

<p>They aren't going to curtail anything, that's just pompous windbag sour grapes. Osborne got his cruel policies shoved down his throat on the world stage, it's the end of him, and if they try and flood the lords it will be the end of the whole government. They got their balls booted, the only reaction we'll see from them is cry baby whinging.</p>

<p>Sour grapes ? LOL. Oh you mean the Conservatives are bitter because they have 323 more seats than the Lib Dems, 99 more than Labour ? <br/>I think we all know who's grapes have gone sour.</p>

<p>And a majority of ?  how many? <br/>That will be gone within 2 years I assure you</p>

<p>Whaddya know? Tories splitting after the EU referendum? Or mass defection to Ukip? What a laugh!</p>

<p>No I mean because they no matter how many seats they have they just got humiliated on the world stage, getting their cruel policies shoved up their ass</p>

<p>They should get Starbucks and google to pay the tax they have dodged and increase the minimum wage to levels that the government does not need to subsidize bad employers</p>

<p>No. No and no again. Companies who quite rightly reduce their tax burden are simply obeying the law. The problem is taxes are too high.</p>

<p>If government wants people to pay more tax, they could change the law. Of course, the solution is simple: cut taxes.</p>

<p>Increasing the minimum wage will merely hike unemployment. There's a massive labour market. Labour saw to that. It's all back to front. Every single thing Labour did was wrong. Now the economy is in a mess and we need to cut welfare after Labour used it as a weapon.</p>

<p>If you want to blame someone, find a Labour voter. This is *their* fault. We'll get out of it by being Conservative: as we all are by nature.</p>

<p>If the chancellor wanted to cut the tax credit Bill he should have started the living wage increase at the same time, this will now force the government to bring it in early </p>

<p>No, no and again, no.</p>

<p>If you increase the cost of something, people buy less of it.</p>

<p>If we wanted to cut the tax credit bill, we just cut taxes.</p>

<p>See? The government gets less income, people get more money. Everyone wins. That is the only way to look at this problem. Any other is absurd.</p>

<p>The tax and benefits laws ALL need changing to a simple method that everyone understands. This system of new names for new taxes every month is just plain robbery. <br/>Osbourne worries how he can take £100 from the poor while his rich mates move billions offshore tax free and companies of the NWO, Google, Yahoo, Facebook, MS etc rake in even bigger tax free profits and then use the money to enslave us. <br/>WE need a massive change at Westminster. MASSIVE.</p>

<p>Time the multi national company's pay there fair share.</p>

<p>They do. Government could change tax law if it wanted. Of course, you're ignoring that taxes are too high.</p>

<p>Osborne's dominatrix:</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/RealNatalieRowe" rel="nofollow">https://twitter.com/RealNatali...</a></p>

<p>Let's see if we can save up enough money to get her to change his mind.  I assume that means that we pay her to withold punishment from George until he's begging for it.</p>

<p>Then we get him to change his mind about attacking the working poor and she can get on with pumelling him, the way he likes it.</p>

<p>Job's a good 'un.</p>

<p>Foreign aid budget would be good to cut, most people would be happy to see that go, time to look after our old people first, we have people with dementia living in poverty and no proper care, time for action.</p>

<p>Osborne would never have budged. I'm listening is total rubbish. he was trying to be smart and take a quick cash grab whilst people starved and lost their homes. All the Tories on TV spouted off about it will be alright in 3 years, Just how do the poor get there ?</p>

<p>They got what they deserved and if they did not secure it with the correct procedures in the right manner to stop the Lords they have only themselves to blame.</p>

<p>If this country has any future of any sort, it's not by having a low wage unproductive economy, propped up by taxpayers subsidising low wages.<br/>The only chance for the future is to have a better paid, lower welfare and lower taxes economy.<br/>Osborne understands that and however painful the change will be, the alternative will be even worse, no successful economy with a good record on social welfare can prosper unless it has a strong economic base.</p>

<p>He needed to get the message that this attempt at the bill was a complete horlicks of an effort.</p>

<p>The Conservatives have a mandate to cut the welfare bill by £12 billion.<br/>I agree they fudged the issue before the election but the final result was that the electorate gave them the option to make the changes as they saw fit. <br/>The Labour and LibDem Peers saw fit to play party politics without any mandate to do so.</p>

<p>Tory proverb: <br/>Give a man a fire, and he will be warm for a day.<br/>Set him on fire, and he will be warm for the rest of his life.</p>

<p>But they aren't blaming themselves are they. What they are doing is eating humble pie. The Osborne for PM campaign is finished. He is unelectable.</p>

<p>Looked at close up when the putty cracks and he had to speak off the cuff tonight, Osbourne reminded me uncannily of David Miiband, empty and uncomfortable away from his role of a plastic Barbie doll./</p>

<p>I thought he was about to burst into tears.</p>

<p>dead eyes</p>

<p>Stop playing the man. Play the ball. Oh! You can't, can you? Logic escapes you Lefties.</p>

<p>And learn to write. Start with a capital, end with a full stop. Or did you receive a Left wing education?</p>

<p>I always get the impression that the underlying drive behind everything that Osborne does is fear- fear that on some fundamental level he is worthless.</p>

<p> And I wonder if that isn't a common drive behind the neurotic ambitions of those who seek political power.</p>

<p>I'm sure that's how you think, but in reality it isn't how government works. If you believe otherwise you're a pillock.</p>

<p>I'm not talking about how government works, I'm talking about individual neurosis. If you've anything useful to say on that subject I'd be happy to hear it. But please try and do it with a little more maturity that is displayed in your comment above.</p>

<p>Yeah. The simple minded think in black and white; the solution is simple for the likes of Osbourne. If the poor were hiding in the trees, he would napalm the entire forests and the elephants to defoliate the trees so he could the easier zap his victims.</p>

<p>The solution *is* simple. Unpopular, but simple. It's time you started to understand: carry on as we are and keep people poor. Change things and we make them richer.</p>

<p>Which do you want? Poverty and self righteousness or to take your medicine and start getting better?</p>

<p>Well, I'm going to bed now and if I dream of tree-climbing elephants it's all your fault :)</p>

<p>I take your point. What I saw in his face could have been fear, (with panic and looseness) under stress.<br/>This would be a very telling character trait.<br/>Heaven help the Tories if he thinks he is worthless. I can see a permanent psychiatric ward in Westminster Palace..</p>

<p>The Labour benches. It's full of nutters.</p>

<p>rofl .... now now :)</p>

<p>rofl ..... :)</p>

<p>C**aine?</p>

<p>Whats the point just yelling covering it all with adjectives?</p>

<p>The factual position will play out over the coming days. This has caused a Major Constitutional Conflict with The Commons,  which will overshadow the original dispute, and that was a crazy way to oppose the Cuts.</p>

<p>So Be It ..... its going to get Bloody over the coming weeks, and The Lords will have only themselves to blame.</p>

<p>Stop dressing it up as something it isn't. It's stupid.</p>

<p>Try justifying that ...... with more than invective.</p>

<p>Corbyne =1: Cameron=0</p>

<p>You're worryingly daft.</p>

<p>Woopie-Do .... rofl :)</p>

<p>Osborne does not look like leadership material to me when you get close up, just as the lesser turncoat Mliband didn't. The more we see of George, he more convinced I am that even the Tories will be reluctant to believe in his leadership qualities.<br/>There is no constitutional crisis, just drama queens mouthing off, as is their wont. The Lords are doing their job.<br/>Portugal has a constitutional crisis which our government should be up in arms about. But no; It is just another U.S./Israeli hatchet job on Hamas as was, with not a murmur from Britain at the time.<br/>I too wait with bated breath but won't underestimate the effect of those old codgers in the Lords.</p>

<p>We shall see what The Commons reaction is. They have already  lodged a complaint with the Speaker.</p>

<p>As for the Cuts, all Osborne does is redraft to achieve the same Goal. It was daft igniting the Yelling Match on the Third Reading, The Lords know full well the Powder keg they would ignite.</p>

<p>We shall see over the coming days.</p>

<p>"It's going to get bloody"?</p>

<p>Hysterical nonsense; Osborne will have to revise it or, better still, think again.</p>

<p>Best quote was "Osborne is over educated for his intelligence"</p>

<p>Zydor gets hysterical all the time he was trying to persuade me only the other day of a major coup by right-wing 'moderates' at Labours' conference..and check out the Capital Letters For Things He Wants To Make A Point About! Like a passive-aggressive SHOUTY PERSON!!</p>

<p>"Things He Wants To Make A Point About! Like a passive-aggressive SHOUTY PERSON!!"</p>

<p>rofl .... have fun, re-read that ..... that does not cover the factual aspect of all this.</p>

<p>That Vote has caused an unnecessary Constitutional Crisis, which was crazy ..... no matter how much you yell otherwise.</p>

<p>The Days ahead will be "Fun" ..... :)<br/>.</p>

<p>Why are you capitalising odd words? Can you not write properly?</p>

<p>Was there any point to that ..... just curious</p>

<p>So what do they do? As Tories abolish the Lords or spend 200 million on another 100-150?</p>

<p>Remember .... you did ask ....</p>

<p>Its easy, they create more Peers on the Tory benches, revote, job done. Created Peers go home to the garden. Bit of a flippant last bit, granted, but that's the way its been resolved in the past, and in the final analysis, will happen again.</p>

<p>...... at the end of the day, its crazy ..... The Lords cannot Block Third Readings of Taxation Bills, they can only Revise - the latter is fact not emotion.</p>

<p>Remains to be seen what the PM will do - Osborne will merely redraft and cuts happen one way or the other, making the whole Grandstanding pointless.</p>

<p>Lets see if Cameron goes for The Lord over this, don't be surprised if he does ..... we shall see in the coming days.</p>

<p>'The Lords cannot Block Third Readings of Taxation Bills,'</p>

<p>Correct, but this was not a bill it was a statutory instrument, they're completely different in there processes and should be used for minor changes to existing regulations, not stifle debate on major changes affecting millions especially on a measure explicitly denied by Cameron and Gove before the election.</p>

<p>Clearly The Commons disagrees with you .... the Yelling has already started. We shall see how it turns out.</p>

<p>Personally I suspect Osborne will just redraft to get the whole Bigger Question of the Autumn Statement on the Books, with redrafted ways of making those Cuts ..... Cameron just takes on The Lords as a separate issue.</p>

<p>We shall see .... neither of us can read minds.</p>

<p>Whatever way Cameron and Osborne chose, this has Ignited a Major Yelling Match with The Lords, and that was unnecessary.</p>

<p>Can I just suggest that, whatever our political views, we all try and practice a little kindness - because when our death approaches that will likely turn out to be the only thing that matters. Thank you and good night.</p>

<p>Politics has become a crass rude deception of name calling, humiliation, complete utter condemnation with no compromise  and mainly because we no longer have democracies in these constitutional monarchies, we have 4-5 year dictatorships from the Prime Ministers Office.</p>

<p>Very likely. But be kind - it helps.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to fight fire with fight.</p>

<p>Especially when it involves people playing with your life.</p>

<p>The first 100 days of a conservative government are riddled with soundbites about working people and little to show in reality. James knows this. Four major blows have been delivered so far:</p>

<p>Blow 1) We're not going to war in Syria, under no circumstances as Labour oppose it. That's how Westminster politics works. Cameron has so far been unable to isolate the Corbyn combo.</p>

<p>Blow 2) Trident funding isn't secure at all.</p>

<p>Blow 3) The Chinese state is invited to buy up HS2 stake and large parts of the city of Manchester, stock the British state is no longer willing to hold. I am not passing judgement on this curious circumstance but will point out that it is not apparent to large parts of our society why that would have to be the case.</p>

<p>Blow 4) The acting government failed again today as Labour's proposals sail through the Lords. This will further reduce the slightest chance of bringing the deficit under control. I think there's some work to do for you now, George. Go on, do some real work.</p>

<p>Call me Dave not so bloody happy tonight</p>

<p>What baffles me is that Osborne seriously misjudged the situation thinking he could do whatever he likes given he is (a) not in a coalition so cannot blame the Liberals and (b) is facing a supposedly weak opposition. What weak opposition?</p>

<p>Osborne showed his true colours yesterday. His fate is sealed.<br/>He will be unelectable as PM of Britain.</p>

<p>He thought he could get it through and have four or five years to 'make good'.</p>

<p>Same as Thatcher's tactics in 1980.  Obviously, a war brought the election closer.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Well, it doesn't usually work out like that, as from 1980 - 1983.</p>

<p>Or 1989 - 1992 recession/depression.</p>

<p>1. Cameron has already made it plain he has no intention of going "to War" over Syria.  ISIL, yes, that's for sure - but that's not "Syria", don't try muddying the waters.</p>

<p>2. Trident is rock solid, there are plenty of Labour MPs who will without hesitation Vote for Trident, as has already been made clear.</p>

<p>3. The Chinese have bid to invest, hardly surprising, as your unclear statement indicates. It has however, nothing to do with this silliness.</p>

<p>4. Nonsense ..... what has just happened has ignited a Big Constitutional Yelling match. The last time this was tried, the Lords lost (1911) .... they will lose again. The Lords cannot dictate Taxation Policy, only revise. They did not do the latter, they attempted to kill it. That is going to cause the Mother of all Constitutional Yelling matches, completely dwarfing the original Tax problem .... and Cuts will still, one way or the other, at the end of the Day, happen.....</p>

<p>The Lords were not given the opportunity to revise because Osborne tried to push it through as a statutory instrument and not as a Bill. His attempt to stifle debate has backfired spectacularly.</p>

<p>Rubbish, they had every chance to revise. Osborne even made that statement many times before the Vote. That Vote was deliberate confrontation with The Commons, and they will not succeed, its a Constitutional nightmare.</p>

<p>All they have done is raise a Nightmare, and covered the Taxation Bill in "smoke" ...... that was very silly.</p>

<p>No they didn't, the Lords cannot revise a statutory instrument they can only vote to proceed, dismiss or delay.</p>

<p>They can revise, Osborne made it clear he was ready to listen, they dint go that route.</p>

<p>What they did was Unconstitutional, very Stupid, and raises a much higher principle that completely buries the original dispute - that was Silly.</p>

<p>Who fed you this tripe that the process was unconstitutional. That's nonsense - a similar thing occured several times before today's hammering of the Chancellor.</p>

<p>Try looking up the process in Parliament ..... the Lords cannot Block Taxation Bills, is hardly a new Principle - its one of the Oldest inside Parliament.</p>

<p>That's only a convention.</p>

<p>Conventions may be not observed.</p>
