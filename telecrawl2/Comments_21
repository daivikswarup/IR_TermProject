<p>The question is, do any of the MPs know what Poppy Day is all about? <br/>There are hundreds of survivors of WW2 who returned to help rebuild a shattered Britain - paying into the NI Fund all their working lives for their pensions - only to be denied those pensions because they joined families in Commonwealth countries (countries who fought side by side with Britain during the war) for their final years.<br/>See <a href="http://www.parity-warrior.com" rel="nofollow">www.parity-warrior.com</a><br/>Retire to Commonwealth countries and suffer frozen pensions; retire to government preferred countries such as Israel, Turkey and Philippines and receive the annual inflation increase. That is the unjust, unethical and discriminatory policy of the British Government - and then MPs are hypocritical enough to wear poppies and bow their heads at commemorative events.<br/>Isn't it about time this gross injustice was eliminated, particularly for those who fought for their country, who suffered the indignities of rationing and who rebuilt Britain after the war. Or perhaps MPs no longer recognise what true Brits used to look like?</p>

<p>He can wear whatever he wants to, that's his right as a British citizen. You don't have to agree with him or anything he stands for, but its his right all the same.</p>

<p>Having had actual dealings with the British Legion, and watching them disgracefully abandon veterans, I, along with every veteran I know who have had to deal with these people, will NEVER wear the red poppy again! I'll attend the memorials, I will wear my veterans badge, and pay respects to those that paid the ultimate sacrifice, but the way they watch veterans sleep under bridges, and REFUSE to give them aid whilst they give their staff pay rises - I CANNOT in good conscience support the legion! If the red poppy wasn't so intimately linked to the legion I'd wear one like a shot!</p>

<p>The white poppy of self-hatred should be outlawed.</p>

<p>Because curtailing freedom of expression is what the red poppy is all about?</p>

<p>No. Because pacifism is self-hatred.</p>

<p>How very Orwellian of you. Explain your reasoning.</p>

<p>I will if you promise not to turn the other cheek</p>

<p>I'm not a pacifist (just mildly annoyed by bombastic nonsense), so feel free.</p>

<p>I would have thought it was obvious to anyone who hasn't been indoctrinated into leftist thinking; to make allowances and excuses for people who wish you dead is an expression of leftist self-hatred.</p>

<p>Pacifism doesn't imply a lack of criticism of people who wish you dead for heaven's sake, it's an objection to all violence and a principled decision not to use it yourself. It's actually pretty damn brave to hold to if someone's coming to hurt you, though for myself I'd prefer to fight back.</p>

<p>Tbh I think you need to take a long hard look at yourself (especially when calling anyone else indoctrinated Mr "pacifism is self hatred") and the disrespect you're showing here, before carping on. On which note I think I'll leave it.</p>

<p>How about the purple magnolia of unutterable pulchritude?</p>

<p>I wear mine with pride</p>

<p>WHY? What have you to be proud about?</p>

<p>Unutterable pulchritude.</p>

<p>I'm 52 and my grandfather was injured in the second day of the Sommes: not that long ago!</p>

<p>Corbyn confused? Yeah right. Lets talk some awkward home truths.</p>

<p>Why is it do you think that one of the last survivors of the D-Day beach landings wore a white poppy for years instead of a red one?</p>

<p> <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/08/poppy-last-time-remembrance-harry-leslie-smith" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/com...</a></p>

<p>Why is it that the population of the UK voted overwhelmingly for a very left wing Labour government in 1945?</p>

<p>Why is it that the likes of Denis Healey, winner of various decorations went on to become a veteran Labour MP and was sick of warfare?</p>

<p>Perhaps its because they knew the history at first hand. They knew that UK press barons and big business bank rolled Hitler in the 1930's. They knew they had to fight the menace but they were damned if they were going to allow profiteers to take us back there again.</p>

<p>Perhaps they remembered the Cliveden set hell bent on making peace before Churchill got a grip? Perhaps they remembered the cowardly flight to Kenya and Canada of many elites during the war? ( the Royal family excepted.)</p>

<p>They didn't succeed. History has swallowed them up but their fury at the corpulence and greed that allowed Hitler to get to power hasn't dimmed.</p>

<p>Don't be fooled by this rhetoric. Yes people will fight evil but it also grows at home. Sadly the red poppy is becoming the shield for crazy interventions across the world. Its now little more than the emblem of the military industrial complex, and that means dollars.</p>

<p> It used to represent the trenches. Not anymore. "Its been twisted into a justification for conflict and for profit. Its about time people understood that they are being played.</p>

<p>Harry finishes with this......</p>

<p>"Next year, I won't wear the poppy but I will until my last breath remember the past and the struggles my generation made to build this country into a civilised state for the working and middle classes. If we are to survive as a progressive nation we have to start tending to our living because the wounded: our poor, our underemployed youth, our hard-pressed middle class and our struggling seniors shouldn't be left to die on the battleground of modern life."</p>

<p>That frankly despite some potty schemes is what Corbyn intends, not selling our souls to Arab/Russian oligarchs and Chinese potentates tax free.</p>

<p>Harry like many of his generation died last year. He and they knew it from bitter experience in '45. Why not now?<br/></p>

<p>Seems a small thing to honour the brave men and women who fought and died on our behalf. Even members of the Corbyn family made sacrifices over the years. Still I am sure Jeremy feels his principles outweigh that respect. If he can't honour the dead then really should not be at the cenotaph... Better celebrating with our enemies he would be so much happier.</p>

<p>The white poppy is designed to honour all the dead, including those sent to die by donkeys. As a principle it doesn't require disrespect to wear one, nor does it signify an insult - unless you're looking for one like McTernan and co, whose schtick is basically PC gone mad (quite literally, this is the Telegraph slagging Corbyn for not being politicall correct).</p>

<p>I have had dealings with a veteran's charity as a veteran myself. We have had many dealings with the legion. They are a DISGRACE (at least the ones I have had to deal with!). I have actually heard them tell veterans suffering PTSD that "they are putting it on to get benefits" THIS from a legion employee! I CANNOT in good conscience wear a poppy - KNOWING that the proceeds go to people like that! It has become a stepping stone for ex-council employees to get civil service jobs - I have seen it happen!</p>

<p>Whilst the legion can sit back, and see veterans homeless sleeping under bridges, whilst ex-council employees are "earning" £40k / year NEVER will I wear the poppy from the legion!</p>

<p>Daily Telegraph still worried about suits, shirts, ties, flags, anthems, poppies, etc, rather than the issues that affect an enormous number of working class and middle class today. People are struggling, kids are going hungry, education and the NHS under attack, young people saddled with enormous debt after receiving the level of education one needs to get a foothold in the job market. Why are you distracting us with this fluff?</p>

<p>This is only my opinion. You are spouting complete drivel. Go back to the Daily Mirror.</p>

<p>Some people have no respect for anything.  Take yourself off you idiot, to some country which does not have the freedom of speech.  You will suddenly become enlightened, but do not come back here, please.</p>

<p>Nice one. You don't like what I have to say so you suggest I shouldn't say it. That's a novel take on freedom of speech. Are you sure you understand the concept? I notice that you didn't address the content of what I said but just doled out an insult. Is that the best you can do?</p>

<p>You regard symbols as "fluff". That's idiotic. You belong somewhere where, by some magic, people aren't struggling, kids aren't going hungry, education and the NHS isn't under attack, young people aren't saddled with enormous debt after receiving the level of education they need to get a foothold in the job market. And where symbols have no meaning. Good luck with that.</p>

<p>What do you believe happens to the money collected for poppies, you oaf?</p>

<p>About 60% of it goes into admin - you'd be better off just wandering London's streets until you found a homeless squaddie and buying the poor chap dinner tbh.</p>

<p>It certainly doesn't go on veterans ! Not when they don't offer posts to veterans and give £40k jobs to ex-council staff who HATE troops! (and I have witnessed this FIRST HAND!)</p>

<p>Eh? What's that got to do with anything? Are we going to fund education, the NHS and social welfare from the proceeds of people selling poppies?</p>

<p>Should have won the election then tommymato ..... And by the way the real anti austerity, anti nuke, socialist party wiped labour out of Scotland..... Quite frankly if I wanted someone to do that in England I would vote SNP and not the clown show now running the Labour Party.</p>

<p>What I'm saying is that the press are great at distracting people with useless fluff that is irrelevant to the issues facing Britain. Whether Corbyn wears a white poppy, a red poppy, a donkey jacket or his pyjamas matters not a jot to people with not enough money to pay the rent, food for their kids, etc. The press would have had us focussing on the stitching on the deck chairs as the Titanic was sinking.</p>

<p>Perhaps because they have no answers and neither do the politicians.</p>

<p>In another Generation, maybe, to a degree, life and feelings will change - they usually do. At present its far too personal for too many Folk in terms of Relatives Roles, and current Military conflicts - very few days have gone by since WW2 when we were not involved in a military conflict of one nature or another.</p>

<p>The stance that many suggest will likely come, not as stark as many put forward, but less formal than now as the numbers of Folk personally affected by their relatives - and their personal activities - in this fade in number. The intensity and number of Military involved now in conflicts, is also starkly less, again having an effect.</p>

<p>Until we get to that place totally, Folk invite a deep inter-generation conflict over this. Arguably the phrase "middle and older" generations illustrates a more intensive view of this than the younger generation (in the very very broadest of contexts, dont get too close to that Broad Grouping), and they are not letting go any time soon. Until they fade away circa a Generation or so, individuals invite unnecessary internal conflict trying to radically change the formats and symbols connected with all this.</p>

<p>It'll change, but not yet, and not for another Generation, even then only in intensity and format.</p>

<p>Yeah right, love for people that hate us. Don't just turn the other cheek, turn off and tune out.</p>

<p>If the ex Japanese POW can forgive their captors - who are we to judge! THEY have the right to hate their captors. I'll go along with the opinion of those who actually suffered!</p>

<p>Deeply patronising of you to assume I haven't suffered. I've had a relative (a doctor) assassinated by the type of group that Milne, Corbyn and McDonnell sing the praises of.</p>

<p>I hope Corbyn doesn't wear a poppy. I hope he continues to blatantly show his vomit-inducing hatred for our country and everything it stands for. Because the more he brings to light the insidious, treacherous Marxism of the section of society he has crawled out of, the more the decent, moral people of this country will ask 'who are these people?' 'how dare they do and say that?!'; and the more these fashionable champagne socialists will find it is they who are suddenly ostracised, that the strings they have been pulling in Whitehall and Fleet Street for so long will be pulled from their turncoat fingers and given back to the people whom they so viciously hate - the hard-working people of this country, whose morals have not been corrupted by some adolescent fantasy fuelled by Russian lies, and who will not stand ildy by for much longer, and watch the things they hold most dear mocked and derided by the likes of this pathetic Soviet agent. March on, Comrade Corbyn, and take your vile ideology with you into oblivion.</p>

<p>"Hates our country grumble... treacherous MARXISM grumble... champagne socialists grumble... Russian LIES..."</p>

<p>You are "Writing by Candlelight" and I claim my £5.</p>

<p>Would that be the same "decent, hard-working people of this country" who<br/> recently voted for a government that would gleefully proceed to f*ck <br/>them up the a*se?</p>

<p>Our culture has been promoting leftist lies for 20-30 years. It will take more than discrediting Corbyn and his hard left savages to turn the tide.</p>

<p>Always find it funny when they go on about Tories doing this or that. They conveniently forget it was Labour who lumbered the NHS with crippling repayments for PFI's just so they could claim they were building more hospitals!</p>

<p>It was Labour who got us entrenched in 2 needless civil wars so their leader could cosy up to Bush!</p>

<p>It was Labour's current deputy who even though he KNEW there was no evidence against Lord Britten STILL pestered the law to hound the man to his grave!</p>

<p>When they point the finger they keep forgetting that 3 fingers point right back at you!</p>

<p>In fairness that was New Labour, which was basically the Tories with fuzzier handcuffs. Which is what makes it so amusing when Tory defenders lay into them, even as Obsorne continues their privatisation policies, shops around for a fun new war having cocked up in Libya and racks up vast debts while doing so.</p>

<p>Why did Labour voters vote for Tories with fuzzier handcuffs? Shouldn't they have voted for Labour? You do realise that by your own logic you ascribe all successes of the 1997-2010 governments to Tories don't you?</p>

<p>Because they hated the actual Tories even more, presumably.</p>

<p>New Labour successes? Must've passed me by while they were busy trying to sell off the Royal Mail, eviscerating the pensions industry for the sake of company profit margins and getting "intensely relaxed" about a (still) woefully unregulated City.</p>

<p>Oh I geddit. You only see what you wanna see. You're one of those types.</p>

<p>My "type" is clear-headed enough not to look at the last 40 years with no historical context. Thatcher, Blair and Cameron are ciphers of the same process of reform which has consistently driven down living standards for everyone below the median.</p>

<p>We've been pushed from a situation where a single worker's average wage could just about sort a mortgage and raise a family to one where a working couple, most likely on zero-hours contracts, are barely able to make rent. We've gone from a position of having a strong, confident working populace to one of craven cap-doffing to managers and cringing supplication to the DwP as it holds the threat of removing benefits that it pays to supplement wages that collapsed under Westminster's watch.</p>

<p>And we're told this is the fault of the left, even though variations of the right have been in charge throughout. Forgive me my sins, but I just don't see what this situation has to offer me, my friends or anyone who isn't already rich. I work, I pay my taxes (a higher real percentage than our Lords and Masters, in fact), but there's no decent safety net to fall back on if I'm put out of work any more, no backup from round the way thanks to the atomisation of my community by new "mobile" (ie. precarious) working and living situations pushing people from place to place.</p>

<p>Automation, casualisation, the loss of job protections - in real terms, to me and everyone else I know, means either the living hell of unemployment or a future of zero-hours rubbish being bullied by bosses with absolutely no rules.</p>

<p>I look at how people lived in those so-called terrible leftie-infested '70s, and for all our many advances, in many ways I damn well envy them. Maybe I'm only "seeing what I want to see." Maybe it's actually roses, and George "one more push comrades" Osborne is going to suddenly reveal a bleedin' utopia over the mountain. But honestly? I think things will only get worse, as has been the case throughout my lifetime, and it's directly related to the political consensus that has run us for four decades now.</p>

<p>Thanks for your considered response. A majority of Brits will always favour the notion of self-reliance over dependency. I'm sorry you always find yourself on the losing side.</p>

<p>I don't, is the thing. As I say, I work so I cover my bills etc. But I fear for the future of those I care for (and of course myself, if things go wrong).  Thing is Brits historically have in the past had a strong sense of collective responsibility - it's actually one of the things Thatcher and co. have done their damndest to lose. A better society needs to find it again.</p>

<p>Pity then you can't see that leftists are the cause of unfairness and inequality.</p>

<p>It's not me who doesn't see, I'm afraid. The left's not had Parliament for more than 40 years and its organs of extra-Parliamentary power were utterly flattened in the '80s. It couldn't be the cause of unfairness and inequality even if it wanted to be. Hell even the Telegraph admits this, albeit tacitly - why do you think it constantly warns that the left will "roll the clock back"?</p>

<p>And a big question is what they think is so terrible about doing so anyway. Full employment? A working class voice worth a damn? Social security that actually is secure? Real wages that pay for more than just bread and a temporary roof? A steel industry? A motor industry? Rail prices that don't bust inflation year after year while offering laughable quality? Utilities ditto? Free education? How far we have fallen since the Lady refused to turn, yet the Telegraph churns ever onwards, launching scathing, tin-foil-hat broadsides against an enemy defeated long ago, chiding them for troubles they couldn't possibly have caused.</p>

<p>That's the story we like to tell ourselves. The reality is Britain's been weighed down by one leftist government after another at least since WWII.</p>

<p>On the contrary, "it's all the lefties' fault" is the story that's been told in the Telegraph, the Sun, the Mail, the Express and indeed most other big media outlets for several decades.</p>

<p>The reality though is that it's neoliberalism, a studiedly right-wing phenomenon, that has presided throughout the last 40 years of industrial and social collapse. Yet despite its enormous influence over our everyday lives, from extensive privatisation to the gutting of workplace rights through legislation such as TTIP, rarely if ever is it examined as being even vaguely linked to our social problems and worsening inequality. Doesn't that seem odd to you at all?</p>

<p>Oh not he neoliberal bogeyman again. It's worse than Nazism they way you lot bang on about it. Somebody had to come up with an alternative to utterly failed socialistic garbage that the ordinary person could see as recognizably human. Socialism takes no account of human nature and always winds up in enslavement. Your anti-neoliberal sentiment is the product of your inability to face the facts of what you are. And anyway, purely neoliberal solutions are being permanently thwarted by the interference of one socialistic government after another.</p>

<p>You really don't see that you're simply projecting your own irrational scapegoating of the almost totally defeated left do you. What happened when an actual anti-austerity party was elected in Greece? It was utterly humiliated, battered, forced to adopt harsher austerity and privatisation than ever before. That's what happens to "interfering socialistic governments" - they haven't (and can't) stop any part of the project.</p>

<p>Lefties do indeed talk about neoliberalism (the mainstream media certainly doesn't, which should speak volumes), and that's because is the hegemonic form of economics. It's been so throughout the period in which we lost our working rights, most of our social securities, our pensions, ended up paying more for less in all manner of key utilities etc. The same simply can't be said of socialism. It's a great shame that you're so intent on avoiding that reality.</p>

<p>Your propaganda tries to equate cronyism with neoliberalism. It's the same old lefty strawman argument that only idiots and zealots buy into.</p>

<p>I'm not propagandising, just explaining the world as I see it. And if you've been reduced to throwing slurs and insults merely by me doing so - while not addressing a single one of my points - then you've got no argument at all, just anger.</p>

<p>Perhaps you should think about why you're having that reaction, rather than throwing a tantrum and refusing to even consider that I might have a reasoned perspective, albeit one you don't agree with.</p>

<p>Which is the behaviour of a zealot, trobrianders, the person who responds to challenges against their worldview with calm reason, or the one who stands there screaming about their opponent's "propaganda" and "idiocy"? Who's the propagandist, the one who gives an honestly-held viewpoint or the one who throws baseless slurs aimed at man, not ball? Who's arguing with strawmen, the one who addresses the points raised or the one who reduces it to "same old lefties"? Take a look in the mirror.</p>

<p>So who buys into lefty strawman arguments if not idiots and zealots?</p>

<p>Perfectly sensible people with a different analysis of the world than you "buy into" pretty well-evidenced arguments, as I've outlined a little in the above notes and which you've repeatedly ignored in favour of repeating rote insults.</p>

<p>Do you have any sensible arguments, or are you signing off with this embarrassing display of pique?</p>

<p>What use do you have for arguments? You just ignore them</p>

<p>Simply repeating "it's all the left's fault" over and over again with no evidence at all to back it up isn't an argument, nor is responding to my various posts with insults.</p>

<p>The closest you've gotten so far to making an actual point is slagging off socialist theory as "utterly failed garbage" and going off on one about how it "always winds up in enslavement" (as though socialism is a homogenous viewpoint with no nuance or variance, or as though I'd identified as one). Which I was ignoring because it's irrelevant to the point I was making that socialism can't be to blame for our current circumstances when socialists haven't been in charge for decades.</p>

<p>Similarly, "your anti-neoliberal sentiment is the product of your inability to face the facts of what you are" is simply a wordier version of ner ner ner ner ner, presumably so you can you feel better about dismissing my views, so why would I bother responding? </p>

<p>I only throw insults at people who firstly invite discussion and then rudely ignore any arguments that challenge their dogma. If you read back you'll see you totally ignored my point that all governments, at least since WWII, have been left leaning and yes I blame our inability to face all our economic and political problems on the insidious leftist culture that has infected our country.</p>

<p>I responded directly to that assertion though, by rejecting it and arguing a different perspective. You offered nothing whatsoever to back it up and instead went off on one about leftist bogeymen accusing me of being delusional, which seems to be something of a habit of yours. Tbh you mostly seem to be looking for a reason to dismiss me as a crank - I'm not, I'm afraid.</p>

<p>You are complete leftist fanatic. Any position even slightly to the right of yours you condemn as something worse than Nazism. Now that your sick politics is resulting in the mass deaths of free civilised people at the hands of barbarians you have invited in because they hate the West almost as much as you lefties do, we are seeing the pendulum swing back. European peoples are going to abandon the dangerous fantasies of lefties and rediscover the steel that got us where we are.</p>

<p>You are well aware I haven't done any such thing, pull yourself together man this is little more than dogmatic ranting and you should be ashamed of yourself for descending to it. I can only presume you're panicking because you've not got any sensible arguments to support your idea that Britain's been controlled by the left since WWII.</p>

<p>When you simmer down a bit you might want to examine your inability to stay calm enough to craft intelligent (or even just civil) responses in the face of a rather mildly-spoken opponent in debate. Why are you so unsettled by me? It's clearly not because I'm a fanatic, which is merely a ridiculous bit of mud slinging. Is it because I'm *not* indulging you in a ranty slanging match?</p>

<p>In the meantime however I see no reason to continue this conversation until you are prepared to behave in a civilised manner. </p>

<p>Good Lord !   don't you think that gut-busting rant might be just a 'little'  bit over the top  ?    <br/>Take a breath for heaven's sake ...   being so angry all the time is not good for your blood pressure.</p>

<p>He got his point over though, did he not.  I agree with him.  More of it.</p>

<p>He mainly demonstrated that he doesn't know much about either what the white poppy stands for (all the dead, including soliders) or why the survivors of WW1 tended to wear it (because the red poppy has been thoroughly hijacked by the government to cover for its incessant warmongering, which of course kills off the very soldiers they're supposed to be respecting).</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>You have to stop hating our country first</p>

<p>What a Scruff! He looks like he's just got out of bed after a bad night out wearing his big brothers shirt!! Would I be proud of him representing me or even Great Britain?<br/>Not on your life!!! If he doesn't behave on Remembrance Day, God help him!!<br/>I fear the Worst!</p>

<p>You fear the worst if he doesn't wear a poppy? What "worst" do you fear?</p>

<p>hmm  ...  I expect you  'feared'  he would refuse a place on the privy council  too  ...  and I'm pretty sure you  'feared'  that he would confront the Chinese president at the Queen's banquet  ...   and no doubt you  'feared'  that he would turn up in 'unsuitable attire'. <br/>How you must have sighed with relief when none of your  'fears'  were realised. <br/>Truth is,  of course,  far from  'fearing'  that Jeremy Corbyn invites criticism,  his opponents are despererately  hoping he does  ...  and their bitter, and angry disappointment when his actions are in no way controversial is palpable.</p>

<p>"and their bitter, and angry disappointment when his actions are in no way controversial is palpable." And marvellously entertaining</p>

<p>Why would an extreme lefty confront the communist president of China? He'd be more likely to hail him as brother and kiss his feet.</p>

<p>@Biffoon "Corbyn is completely free to wear a red poppy, a white poppy, or nothing at all. As the Leader of the opposition, the electorate will judge him and his party accordingly."</p>

<p>You obviously don't know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Corbyn is being paid to do a job, all £150,000 of it, that role requires him pay respect to the war veterans, he knew that before taking the job. If he didn't like it he should not have taken the job.</p>

<p>No one has forced him to do that job, he has made that decision on his own free will.</p>

<p>Its bit like going to a supermarket checkout to pay for the wine and the cashier says he can't serve alcohol because of his religion. Well don't work there fool.</p>

<p>You are Liz Kendall and I claim my £5.</p>

<p>No ,  David is better looking</p>

<p>John McTernon was a rabid supporter of the Iraq war and so is one of those responsible for sending our troops to die on a false premise.</p>

<p>His use of the death of soldiers to score cheap political points is frankly sickening.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Everyone knew we went to war on a pretext. But the people allowed for it. What's sticking in your craw is not the hypocrisy of leaders but of the people.</p>

<p>Most people, apart from many guilty politicians, did not know until after the war that it was based on a false premise.</p>

<p>Over two million people marched against the war on an anti-war protest, which was ignored by those guilty politicians.</p>

<p>So both your claims are false.</p>

<p>At least you are consistent.</p>

<p></p>

<p>Most people did not know? Your typical patronising leftist view that people are sheeple doesn't wash for most normal British people who generally know the score.</p>

<p>Corbyn is completely free to wear a red poppy, a white poppy, or nothing at all. As the Leader of the opposition, the electorate will judge him and his party accordingly.</p>

<p>"Cut the guy a bit of slack"</p>

<p>He has been wearing those all his life.</p>

<p>Corbyn is too much of a coward not to wear the Red Poppy. So he will do a U turn in his principle, if he was a true leader he would stick by his principles and not wear it.<br/>But look at him few days ago top to tail tuxido outfit eating royal meals. He could have taken a Holiday, but could not resist the rich life.<br/>You could not make it up.</p>

<p>What I find interesting is that Cameron, that staunch defender of all that is good and proper, fauns all over the Chinese, and it is left to the socialist Corbyn to criticise the human rights record of a Communist regime. Imagine the howls of protest from DT readers if it had been the other way round.</p>

<p>It's racist to think the world is waiting with bated breath for the British to say something about human rights to China or anyone else as if that would make all the difference. Get over yourself.</p>

<p>Who suggested that the world is waiting for it or that it would 'make all the difference'? Not me. Anyone can criticise the Chinese government, Cameron, Corbyn, you, me, people in deepest Peru, anyone. And by the way, it's 'bated breath' not 'baited'.</p>

<p>The Chinese can't. They're really the ones that need to though aren't they? That's the thing you're not getting. It's deeply patronising to assume everyone in the world wants to be like you. They don't.</p>

<p>So, are you suggesting that because the Chinese can't criticise China that no one else should? I'm really not getting your argument. And no, I don't assume everyone wants to be like me. Where are you getting that from? You sound confused to be honest.</p>

<p>Most Chinese people would utterly reject your pompous ideas about human rights. But like a typical lefist do-gooder bore you're completely oblivious.</p>

<p>You could not make it what up?</p>

<p>And there you have it.<br/>The rabid Corbyn attackers summed up in a nutshell   ...   damn him if does  and damn him if he doesn't. <br/>What you don't seem to understand is the frenzied smearing by his opponents is only serving to make his supporters more determined.</p>

<p>Cut the guy a bit of slack, for goodness sake. I'm no supporter of Labour, far from it (how anyone could vote for them after they opened the immigration floodgates I don't know), but Corbyn does have an honesty, integrity and authenticity the others badly lack, and I at least give him credit for that.</p>

<p>Yes he is an authentic supporter of Hamas and the IRA.</p>

<p>Zzzz...</p>

No. What it means is that I think to bring about a peace process, you have to talk to people with whom you may profoundly disagree ... There is not going to be a peace process unless there is talks involving Israel, Hezbollah and Hamas and I think everyone knows that." Jeremy Corbyn</p>

<p>Resorting to personal abuse sometimes becomes irresistable when someone has revealed themself incapable of thinking outside a narrow strait-jacket of received prejudice.</p>

<p>That quote is total BS and you know it.</p>

<p>In both this and your earlier comment you're grossly simplifying Corbyn's position on these issues. Unfortunately, I suspect that you  probably don't know it.</p>

<p>This comment was deleted.</p>

<p>Corbyn's problem is that the full weight of the establishment propaganda machine is doing its best to make his position impossible - including weighted exaggerations of his links with so-called terrorist organisations (I don't deny the links btw - they seem appropriate and understandable for a politician of his persuasion. No debate would be possible, after all, if everyone were an apologist for the IDF or the UDA).</p>

<p>Whatever one's view on his beliefs and policies, these media smears are an (increasingly self-defeating) smokescreen to deflect attention from the threat any further increase in his popularity might pose to the withering, unsustainable status quo.</p>

<p>I appreciate you'll likely disagree in the strongest possible terms :)</p>

<p>Lucky for you that you and your family are safe from the kind of savages that Corbyn supports - for now.</p>

<p>Do you seriously believe the British Crown's representatives have never murdered and blown-up people to achieve their ends?</p>

<p>So you approve of violence then?</p>

<p>How does what I say suggest that? I'm just pointing out that no one  really has the high moral ground when it comes to acts of violence.</p>

<p>I do approve, as you may remember, of unutterable pulchritude :)</p>

<p>Oh go to bed :)</p>

<p>Why would you care if  new IRA supporting Labour leadership wear red poppies? <br/>They would be hypocrites anyway.</p>

<p>"He's not a pacifist; he supports armed struggle "</p>

<p>You got that right - IRA, Russia, Hamas,.... the only problem is the people who Corbyn supports are taking freedom and democracy away.</p>

<p>So you are WRONG overall in your argument.</p>

<p>He's not a pacifist; he supports armed struggle - naturally, only by those whom he likes, but he supports armed struggle nonetheless.  If wearing a white poppy, or even no poppy at all, makes his little heart glow with pride, let him get on with it.  Isn't that freedom the purpose of the conflicts?  E.g. so we didn't have to wear swastikas etc.  Although I'm sure Mr. Corbyn would love us all to be branded with the hammer and sickle, because he doesn't believe in individual choice.</p>

<p>Corbyn will wear the Red Poppy - otherwise the Country will toast him.</p>

<p>I don't know about the whole country,  but I agree,  a fair few will raise a glass.</p>

<p>Of course he will wear a red poppy.  His egalitarianism did not stop him from "white tie and tails" at Buckingham Palace.<br/>I remember when Labour politicians of the 1945-1950 government just wore lounge suits at such events.</p>

<p>I don't think there were any such events during that period.</p>

<p>Corbyn has worn both a white and red poppy together in the past. That is probably what he'll do this time as well.</p>

<p>@tony_opocahunts  "Incidentally, I do support Putin bombing ISIS, because The Government of Syria asked Russia to help defend their country against the NATO backed foreign Intervention."</p>

<p>You obviously don't know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>1) NATO is not involved in Syria<br/>2) Government of Syria has not been elected by the Syrian people in a free and democratic elections.</p>

<p>Neither the Saudi or the Kuwaiti governments were elected by their people in free and fair democratic elections, but that didn't stop the US coming to their aid in the First Gulf War.</p>

<p>Turkey was part of the mutual defence organisation NATO even when under military dictatorship. So your argument is irrelevant.</p>

<p>The discussion around Poppy Day always centres around the First and Second World Wars. It is quite right that we remember the sacrifices made, but that generation has passed away. Poppy Day should really be about acknowledgement that those who follow the Colours, in our interest, can pay a terrible price. Some come back altered in mind and body, some do not come back at all; they are also somebody's son, somebody's husband, somebody's father. <br/>There are people dependent on the help of the Legion from every decade since the war, from old boys who fought in Korea, Malaya and a dozen other places, through the Troubles and the Falklands, to children still in nappies left fatherless by Iraq and Afghanistan.<br/>The focus on history deflects from what the red Poppy should really remind us of, we owe a debt of blood to those that are still paying the price of military action, every day of their lives.</p>

<p>Yes Corbyn knows what Poppy Day is all about. His dad was in the Home Guard.</p>

<p>WTF is "Poppy day"</p>

<p>new_number_2?<br/>Well I heard about number 2, so how does the "new" work in number_2, do you do it whilst upside down and then it falls on to your face?</p>

<p>I oppose war full stop. Although Russia's air strikes arguably have more legal basis than the US coalition, Russia is merely asserting its own interests in Syria just as the West has been doing.</p>

<p>"Michael   Foot's infamous Remembrance Day 'donkey jacket'" how about you add a bit about the rest of Foot's disgraceful performance in particular how he bothered to handwrite the tribute on his wreath's card to our fallen service men and women, unlike Thatcher and the others who had printed cards with theirs.</p>

<p>How about you mention that we wasn't wearing a f*cking donkey jacket?</p>

<p>In my mind a fairly secondary issue.</p>

<p>If it looks like a tramp, walks like a tramp, talks like a tramp, acts like a tramp, dresses like a tramp, behaves like a tramp, then it probably is a tramp.</p>

<p>I believe it was actually a fair expensive jacket and also Foot had tried to join up but was medically unfit.</p>

<p>Michael Foot was badly treated but like Corbyn he should never have been leader.</p>

<p>Very true, but I do find lies and half-truths offensive.</p>

<p>Everyone knows it wasnt a donkey jacket, I believe the post was directed at Corbyn.</p>

<p>I appreciate that you may not be a well person,  but your comments are inane, boring and factually incorrect.</p>

<p>I agree. You are clearly a tramp.</p>

<p>Corbyn is funny.</p>

<p>"Does Jeremy Corbyn have any idea what Poppy Day is about?"</p>

<p>No, because he is a clueless tramp.</p>

<p>Go back to your football game - Moron United isn't it?</p>

<p>It is Armistice day or remembrance day.</p>

<p>The writer seems to be stretching the truth. At 68 years old and having taken part in remembrance day services and parades I have never seen the eleventh minute included in the time and date before. Traditionally it was always the eleventh hour, of the eleventh day,of the eleventh month and never before have I heard or read the eleventh minute mentioned.<br/>That does not change the thrust of the article that it is not military might that is being remembered but the fallen of all nations in a war that was supposed to end all wars which we now know was not true so it now includes the dead of other wars too.<br/>I doubt very much though that it will ever include the dead of the terrorist organisations that Corbyn supports.</p>

<p>Too much to ask for Viz....sorry, DT do any kind of research into an article. What is laughable is this comic puts this article under the headings "News" and "Investigations"!!!!...........You can't make this up : ))</p>

<p>Give it a minute or two this will probably be flagged as spam, i've put this info up three times, have written it three different ways and after about 10 minutes is delated.</p>

<p>Well this will be the third time I post this as it keeps getting detected as spam, but just do a two second image search with the words Jeremy Corbyn and remembrance day, you'll see him wearing a poppy and holding a reef. let's see how many minutes this lasts before being removed...</p>

<p>The problem is not so much a single event - it is the cumulative impression his general behaviour presents which is more the subject for comment. He has been leader now for a short time and the tone of his attitude has been laced with the sneery, childish 'point-making' so typical of those keen to be seen as some sort of 'rebel'.</p>

<p>A bit like Gordon Brown and his lounge suit decision, "I'm so important, I'm too good to be like everyone else, look at me!"</p>

<p>Corbyn should make his own decision about what to wear on Remembrance Day just as the electorate will make their own decision about his fitness for office.</p>

<p></p>

<p>just do a two second image search with the words Jeremy Corbyn and remembrance day, you'll see him wearing a poppy and holding a reef.</p>

<p>Remembrance Sunday is about telling our politicians that their wars cost the nation.<br/>What Corbyn does is his responsibility but if he ever forgets who pays yhe price of political mistakes then wearing a poppy or not is the least of his problems.</p>

<p>Whether we wear poppies in pride or regret is debatable. There are many reasons to regret WW1 and the loss of life which some would say was pointless.</p>

<p>Even the right wing historian Niall Ferguson agrees:</p>

<p>"Britain entering first world war was 'biggest error in modern history'"</p>

<p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/30/britain-first-world-war-biggest-error-niall-ferguson" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/wor...</a></p>

<p>I think that is very likely right. We should have left France and Germany to slog it out.</p>

<p>They wouldnt have slogged it out Germany would have won easily by 1915 at latest.</p>

<p>And then it would have all been over by Christmas 1914!</p>

<p>The guardian?  LOL</p>

<p>Opposing Europe being plunged into a dark age is/was hardly pointless.</p>

<p>Dark ages eh, you are talking about WW2, a direct result of WW1 which was an over reaction plus the Kaiser wanting to rule the waves rather than us, nor did we need to be caught up in the collapse of the Habsburg empire.</p>

<p>Without which there would have been no Communist attempts to take over the Weimar Republic (Stalin and his chums had been busy all around parts of Europe and indeed Britain pre-WW1), no Hitler and chums to oppose them, probably no attempt to eradicate European Jewry (actually Poland hated them even more according to my now deceased Polish neighbours), no economic collapse, no fatal blow to Britain's wealth from which we never recovered, no massive and unnecessary loss of life etc., etc.</p>

<p>Obviously this is a precised account, there is much more detail involved but WW1 from the western European and British viewpoint was a terrible mistake, as is obvious once you consider the catastrophic consequences, economically and human.</p>

<p>Germany would have taken over France and from that all Western Europe and North Africa.</p>

<p>And then what, claimed a few French provinces and colonies and gone home, saving 10 millions of lives</p>

<p>Why would they have gone home?</p>

<p>That is hypothetical, my opinion is that they ultimately would have failed, the death of millions of others including the British was not worth the price.</p>

<p>It isnt hypothetical at all unless you consider the British and commonwealth soldiers had no material effect on the Germans and the French had enough men and equipment to hold the front without them.</p>

<p>Germany in 1914 was a very civilised country with much more advanced social security than in the UK.</p>

<p>Except it wasnt the nurses and doctors invading France.</p>

<p>Well if the UK did not intervene in the 1870 Franco Prussian war , why should we have intervened in the 1914 Franco Prussian war, except for Earl Greys foolish alliance.</p>

<p>The two were on a completely different scale, the Germans would never have left France.</p>

<p>How do you know that?</p>

<p>Who would make them? Prussia wasnt Germany.</p>

<p>You assume they would have won the war, and you assume they would want to permanently occupy a presumably hostile country. None of these assumptions can be tested.</p>

<p>They would have won no doubt about that it took the British commonwealth and finally USA to beat them.</p>

<p>Germany was expansionist the biggest problem for Germany was its navy being pinned in North sea ports. They would have kept the ports and Industrial areas plus taken French colonies.</p>

<p>I don't think you are talking about WW1 but WW2.</p>

<p>Nope.</p>

<p>Germany in 1914 was not much like Germany in 1939, I don't think there is much comparison. Having said that it is true that the UK had signed treaties with France and guaranteed Belgian neutrality, however both of those pacts could be seen as mistakes.</p>

<p>It took all of the strength of UK +commonwealth + France to hold Germany.</p>

<p>I don't think someone associated with the likes of the warmonger Blair who sent British soldiers to die for no reason has any right to lecture on wearing the poppy.</p>

<p>@Odyssyass  "It's totally appropriate to wear whatever you f***ing want on "Poppy Day". Get over it."</p>

<p>Sure, for traitors it is. - Get over it, you are anti-UK but will not live anywhere else.<br/>What a Dork.</p>

<p>Surely,only dorks bandy the words "traitor" or "anti-uk" around : ))</p>

<p>It's totally appropriate to wear whatever you f***ing want on "Poppy Day". Get over it.</p>

<p>Odysseus, please remember people died for you to be able to say that.</p>

<p>Get. A. Life.</p>

<p>Sanctimonius damn idiot - you're probably not old enough to remember the last war but nevertheless you no doubt  like to pretend you're intimately acquainted with the horrors. My family were all heavily involved and believe me they wanted nothing more post 1945 than to forget faux patriotism and the glorification of bloodshed.</p>

<p>Wear what you like, as in fact 95% of people ACTUALLY DO.</p>

<p>Most of the dead soldiers in both wars would no doubt like to shout out "Move on, for chrissake".</p>

<p>Well don't worry they died in vain. press freedom is about to be abolished.</p>

<p>Don't be silly.</p>

<p>no the Leveson recommendations to cripple the free press are about to be implemented.</p>

<p>I agree, but if you take a responsible position representing the opposition, at a remembrance service in the presence of war veterans you wear the symbol of remembrance.  Corbyn can delegate attendance to someone less pathetic and precious.  It is a remembrance service it is about the fallen and veterans not  him.</p>

<p>How cheap is for Chicken Corbyn to use this issue to attack UK Citizens?</p>

<p>Traiotorism really is the last refuge of a scoundrel.</p>

<p>Or Patriotism, as the other man said, writing in English.</p>

<p>A two second search on google images "Jeremy Corbyn Remembrance day" will show a picture of him wearing a red poppy and laying down a reef. Instead you decided to write a false smear article. You as a journalist could be writing articles on say tax credits on how in a long term they don't make sense, how the government are right to reform the current welfare system, but how they were wrong to not have a transitional phase in between the minimum wage going up. You could also make an article on the fool hardy sugar tax idea.</p>

<p>If you want kids to stop eating sugary, salty, fatty food have a blanket ban of fast food adverts pre watershed, bill boards &amp; online social media sites.</p>

<p>Remove and fine if necessary shops that are advertising sugary, fatty foods close to the point of sale, and have them located on top shelves. And finally encourage healthy eating in both adults and children with free online cookery lessons, that can be quick, cheap and tasty.</p>

<p>The problem is as humans we are pre-programmed to like these kinds of foods. Only through education at an early age can you prevent this problem. Lets not forget parents give fatty bad food to children because it's cheaper than the healthy option, they could be worked off their feet and want a fast option, and they don't want to deal with the pressure of the whining child.</p>

<p>It is an epidemic of the west and unfortunately you do need to nanny occasionally people into healthier life styles like we did with cigarettes. I don't think you should however hit the wallet of people who can monitor their diet.</p>

<p>So in summary removing the pester power from advertisers and companies and by providing and if necessary subsiding a quick healthy alternative, you remove the problem. Of course companies and lobbyists will hate the idea and use all their influence in the government and the press to stop such a rational and thought out response to the health crisis but think of the millions saved in the NHS.</p>

<p>Scumbag Corbyn has estimated £5,000,000.00 personal wealth but refuses to donate £1 for a poppy.<br/>Shame on you Corbyn.</p>

<p>I don't share Corbyn principle, but wealth isn't a relevant consideration..</p>

<p>Scumbag Blair has an estimated £60,000,000 personal wealth but refuses to compensate the victims of his wars.</p>

<p>See the post above yours.</p>

<p>How cheap is using Remembrance Sunday to attack a political opponent?</p>

<p>Patriotism really is the last refuge of a scoundrel.</p>

<p>How cheap is it to (cynically) attend a remembrance which you state is wrong headed and shouldn't happen?</p>

<p>So he's wrong either way, huh? Damned if he attends, damned if he doesn't.  No wonder he chooses to do what the hell he likes and to hell with imbeciles in The Torygraph comments section.</p>

<p>Many will probably find his anti-war views refreshing after the Blair years. Sure, Cameron and Blair both do the solemn observance act well, but both are a little too fond of war.</p>

<p> McTernan totally doesn't get that the British public are wholly sick of overseas meddling and senseless wars.</p>

<p>Causing wars and remembering the soldiers who died in two World Wars are entirely different things.</p>

<p>It's not so much the soldiers that we should remember (though them as well), as the bloody idiocy that stokes patriotic fires and create nationalism, and thus wars. And to some extent "Poppy Day" feeds such crude sentiments.</p>

<p>My understanding of history is that the invasion of Belgium caused Britain to enter WW1 and the invasion of Poland caused WW2.  Neither were caused by patriotism or nationalism.  Keeping to the terms of a treaty is probably something that modern weasels would not understand.  Poppy Day feeds nothing in the way you describe, except to the terminally stupid on one side and the terminally idiotic on the other.  Judging historical events by modern pseudo righteousness is never a good plan.</p>

<p>Senile windbaggery old boy. Mind you don't spit all over your clean shirt and tie.</p>

<p>All wars are caused by nationalism, by definition.</p>

<p>Other people's nationalism caused the two invasions already discussed.  Could be you might be more at home in the Morning Star.</p>

<p>Could be you'd be more at home with round the clock nursing care.</p>

<p>Another fifteen years like the last fifteen will turn Britain into the place where you will really feel at home.</p>

<p>Does the Daily Telegraph love Britain?     If it does why doesn't its owners pay UK Tax<br/>on its profits?.</p>

<p>I suspect the Barclay Brothers view the UK as the 'European Sector -North West' of the Global Economy in which they park their profits.</p>

<p>Always pleased to oblige.</p>

<p>The Telegraph Media Group made a pre-tax profit of £45.7m in 2014, making the DT the most profitable newspaper in the country.</p>

<p>Any more little pearls of wisdom you'd like to share with us? Maybe you should just stick to the drivel that you soak up on those hate/conspiracy sites, or drunken ramblings about your family.</p>

<p>@tony_opocahontas "Corbyn is not a war monger. He's a non-violent pacifist."</p>

<p>Which planet do you live on?</p>

<p>Corbyn has backed IRA, Russia and his friends Hamas - all violent organisations.</p>

<p>If you are going to talk about a serious subject at least have some basic knowledge about the subject.</p>

<p>Cameron is friends with Saudi Arabia where the Bin Ladens are from, that arms ISIS and kills thousands of their own citizens.  Take your pick.</p>

<p>The difference is this: as head of government you have to do business with governments from all over the world, and most of these do not appreciate being preached human rights and democracy. Indeed, the Saudis consider democracy is anathema. <br/>As a private citizen, you can chose your friends. Corbyn's friends are the IRA, Hamas, Putin.</p>

<p>I know who I'd rather be friends and work with.  Saudi Arabia actively seek to undermind security in the Western world and links back from terrorist atrocities across Europe are not hard to find.  Unless you're an idiot of course.</p>

<p>Why does one have to choose between supporting one bunch of terrorists against another?  Once a terrorist, always a terrorist. Same with their supporters. Jeremy Corbyn is a rat.</p>

<p>He's not anything my dear.    He's certainly not worth the amount of bile that this so patriotic paper attempts to pour over him.</p>

<p>You would prefer to work with Hamas, the IRA and Putin? Or do you think that ranting on the side, jumping up and down, and complaining about Saudi support for: ISIS; for Wahahbite preachers in the UK; etc..Do you think this would yield much. And if you do not like the House of Saud, what makes you think that the guys who would take over from them would be an improvement?</p>

<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but did not the British Government engage the Provisional IRA in the negotiations which ended the 'armed struggle' in Northern Ireland?</p>

<p>The British government used diplomacy and military force to bring the IRA to the table. A few days after the IRA sought to assassinate the British government, Corbyn hobnobbed in the Commons with IRA leaders. Maybe you can spot the difference?</p>

<p>And has he ever benefited from the stance he took in relation to Provisional Sinn Fein at the time?  If anything, it has damaged his reputation.  I think that is the difference, though there are some who think the Blair government conceded too much in the Good Friday agreement.</p>

<p>No. He is a friend of the IRA. The IRA is an enemy of the UK. Simples.</p>

<p>Peaceniks and Lefties like Corbyn will be the first to say let me in first on their way to the Gulags</p>

<p>Corbyn to be pilloried in the Mail and the Telegraph if he doesn't wear a red poppy on Remembrance Sunday; Manchester City to be disciplined by UEFA because their fans booed the UEFA anthem last night -can we arrange for someone to challenge Nigel Farage to sing Beethoven's melodious hit 'An die Freude' or be barred from the Chamber in Strasbourg?  Or could we just take a more adult and mature position on these issues?</p>

<p>Private people's behaviour is a matter for them, naturally - however, when people enter or seek to enter public office there are certain protocols, etc., which people prefer to see observed and so on. To make a fuss as he is over these issues is the infantile stance, in fact.</p>

<p>"when people enter or seek to enter public office there are certain protocols, etc., which people prefer to see observed and so on"</p>

<p>Such as respecting beloved British institutions like the NHS, Royal Mail and the BBC, and not seeking to sell them off to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>No they are 'beloved' only in your mind. They are simply there to deliver a service. They may do that very well or very badly, but they are not sacred cows which must be preserved at all costs. Although I have to say that with the BBC and NHS it often seems that way. An elected government is perfectly well entitled to deal with them as seems best. With the BBC privatisation seems very attractive.</p>

<p>Not quite. However, I doubt many will be having sleepless nights a great deal over the BBC, frankly - and the NHS rather needs some attention, don't you think?</p>

<p>I take it you are referring to Tony Blair's buddy John McTernan?</p>

<p>I am talking generally actually - Corbyn is just one example of the breed.</p>

<p>Corbyn refuses to wear the Poppy - so this rich boy silver spoon in his mouth pompous sod have never donated any money to the people who have defended this country, he rather donate his money to IRA, Russia and his friends Hamas.</p>

<p>Corbyn's personal wealth has been estimated to £5,000,000.00 (£5 MILLION) but he can't donate £1 to the our retired service personnel.</p>

<p>Corbyn is a #1 Traitor.</p>

<p>Note: INHERITED wealth. This hypocrite doesn't much care where the money comes from - he'll spend it. Or, since he's a mealy-mouthed skinflint, he'll keep it and count it.</p>

<p>Jesus H Christ, you're easily taking the Torygraph drooling demented idiot of the day award, and that in itself is no easy feat.</p>

<p>Ha ha.  Did you see Cameron yesterday?  Now that man is the real traitor.  He hates Britain more than anyone, holds court with terrorist backers and sells everything off to anyone with a bit of cash.</p>

<p>Red, White?  Who cares?  I'll wear my poppy and my dad's medal at Remembrance and apart from that I couldn't care less what anyone else does.</p>

<p>Chicken Corbyn is an unappreciative pompous sod. The rich boy Corbyn born with a silver spoon in his mouth is a war monger who supports IRA, Russia and Hamas. Of course idiots like will never go to the front line themselves to protect democracy and freedom but has no problem to use those privileges of the society that others have given their lives to to peddle his vile communist and anti-UK propaganda. <br/>Chicken Corbyn is a waste of space.</p>

<p>Isn't it time we quit worrying about every little thing Mr Corbyn does?  We've become obsessed with just another left wing politician who simply wants to move Britain ever closer to communism.</p>

<p>How much does Mr Corbyn differ from all the other Labour leaders?  Is he that much different than Mr Miliband (either brother) or Mr Blair?  Or Burnham, Cooper, etc.  All these leading politicians work towards big government, something to look after the citizens of the nation, a big brother who takes care of us 'from cradle to grave'.</p>

<p>The problem isn't Jeremy Corbyn, it is our inability or refusal to be responsible for our own lives.</p>

<p>Normally he wouldn't matter at all - however, he is now in a position to influence the government of this country which makes it at least worth monitoring, don't you think...?</p>

<p>Oh yes, Corbyn is much further to the left.  In fact, much further left than the majority of people in this country.</p>

<p>My father in law died in May of this year at the age of 93. He went through World War Two in the Sappers (and just to give it an extra dimension he was Jewish) so my wife applied for and got two tickets to march in the civilian contingent on Remembrance Sunday wearing his medals. The other ticket will be used by my younger daughter who will be wearing the First World War medals awarded posthumously to her great, great uncle. My daughter is 22, my great uncle was 5 years younger than her when he was killed two months after the War started, he lied about his age. That is what remembrance is about for thousands of families and we don't give a **** what some sneering, self-righteous, chippy, little s*ds think</p>

<p>"we don't give a **** what some sneering, self-righteous, chippy, little s*ds think"</p>

<p>So much anger and abuse aimed at people you claim not to care about.</p>

<p>I don't care about you or your views and I regard my description as spot on.</p>

<p>Then you display a staggering lack of self-awareness.</p>

<p>And you add a whole new meaning to the word 'pompous.'</p>

<p>If Jeremy Corbyn wants to win respect then he needs to be respectable and he needs to show respect for others. He manages neither.</p>

<p>Or could it not also be asked if people respect Jeremy Corbyn's views?  If the public don't approve of them, they can choose who to vote for at the ballot box.</p>

<p>Dont worry they will</p>

<p>That's only part of the issue. The thing is that a weak opposition is bad for parliamentary democracy and therefore bad for Britain.</p>

<p>I agree with you, but we must allow our politicians to be honest about issues, even if it does them no favours.  I would rather Corbyn behave openly and honestly than deceive the public just to keep up appearances.</p>

<p>Does the Telegraph have any idea what proper journalism is about  ?<br/>Is there no sense of shame,  or embarrassment at least,  at this relentless smear campaign ?  <br/>Surely there must be a head-shaking weariness amongst journalists,  and the odd moment of thinking,  " oh God,  I have to churn out more of this crap ...  really ?"</p>

<p>Go and read the Mirror then, where there's a relentless smear campaign against the Tories.</p>

<p>You shouldn't be reading this paper.</p>

<p>Fighting for your freedumb.</p>

<p>PAYE introduced during wartime ... so, you can't avoid income tax</p>

<p>Conscription ... forced labor.</p>

<p>Sequestration of property for military use ... land, farms, homes.</p>

<p>Since WW2, almost complete civilian disarmament.</p>

<p>An all-encompassing surveillance State.</p>

<p>Freedom. You guys have no idea of the word's meaning.</p>

<p>Is it just a coincidence that every "war" leads to the loss of your freedoms? </p>

<p>Seriously?  Do you actually read the comments sections of the Telegraph?  It's like they are manned by a thousand Matthew Hopkins.</p>

<p>"it is the sacrifices of that war, above all others which we commemorate" -sacrifices for what? The First World War was arrogant imperialism at its cynical worst from Caesar William's obsession with German power to the bungling British Generals and politicians who sent Empire troops to their deaths to expand their territory outside Europe that Germany wanted inside it. I have never worn a poppy because it is irrelevant to me, if others want to wear it, fine, but to impose it on people is cultural fascism but the ruling class are apparently so terrified of Corbyn they will use all and any excuse to judge him by their inherently worthless standards.  Our Prime Minister will bow and scrape to the Saudi Royal Family, maybe he should wear a blood-stained cassock in the Cenotaph to symbolise the innocent people butchered by our allies in the public squares of that horrible kingdom.</p>

<p>If you feel that way, fine, if Corbyn does thats fine too, just dont go to the service as leader of the opposition.</p>

<p>Why not? Does the Leader of the Opposition now have to do as everyone else does or be damned?  What on earth has happened to free speech and democracy? Is there a law that says the Leader of the Opposition must wear a red poppy?</p>

<p>There is no law that says he has to go.</p>

<p>Quite. Far more cynical and unpleasant to attend something you oppose the ethos of than to wear a red poppy for something you sympathise with.</p>

<p>It's about the glorification of the State's military force ... its Standing Armies ... and by extension, the State itself.</p>

<p>That is not how its inventor, the American Moina Michael saw it, but I don't see how the actuality of war can be ignored, it is a matter of balance.</p>

<p>I don't see how you can separate the two, I understand the origins of the poppy in New York and what it intends to represent, but I don't see how you can simply wish away the war and its aims as if they were of secondary importance to those who died.</p>

<p>The Dismalgraph is sinking to new lows on a daily basis.</p>

<p>Never mind Corbyn, who at least has some principles and sticks to them, what would the brave people who gave up their lives have thought of unpatriotic tax-dodging billionaires like the Barclay Brothers, who hole themselves up in tax-dodging enclaves like Sark and Monaco, to avoid paying taxes in the very country these brave people fought for?</p>

<p>Very very little I would imagine.</p>

<p>It says that I'm concerned that a once reasonably good quality newspaper is turning into a rancid billionaire's plaything.</p>

<p>There's plenty better, just about everything in fact.</p>

<p>Still, if I can make just one of you dolts see the error of your ways...</p>

<p>Arrogance!  Who's the dolt?</p>

<p>How can wearing a white poppy be the "wrong" thing to do?!  It might for example be a gesture of solidarity for loss of war while not necessarily subscribing to the nationalist undertones of the red poppy.  Post-war immigrants, for example, might not want to adorn a symbol dedicated to British lives lost decades before they became a citizen.  Some Northern Irish Catholics might be repelled by it's status as one of the most revered symbol of those that carried out Bloody Sunday.  These groups could wear white for a legitimate reason: to remember war dead in a more nationally neutral way..</p>

<p>4,000 out of 6,000 voters (at the last count) above DISAGREE wth you.</p>

<p>I'm crushed</p>

<p>How?? Thats easy ....</p>

<p>The Red Poppy is a simple symbol a reminder of Flanders .... a very personal remembrance of individuals and what they gave up .... never mind the Politics, never mind contrived issues real or imagined .... the latter is nonsense.</p>

<p>Its a simple, thoughtful way of remembering people and what they gave up.</p>

<p>Without all the attendant claptrap real or imagined .... its the people themselves and what they gave up (whether the cause was right or wrong), not why it happened, or whose fault it was or .... (insert a Gazillion Topics)</p>

<p>........ its not hard to understand ... :)</p>

<p>I well understand the symbology.  I don't agree with the hegemonic desire to resist nuanced expressions of the same symbol.</p>

<p>Well if you are leader of major political party then perhaps not choosing to spit in the face in the 100,000s of Labour party supporters that died in uniform might be a good idea.</p>

<p>My Grandfather was a trade union official and woodworking machinist and he wore his poppy every year. Unlike Ciorbyn who middle class marxist  narcissist who care so much about the working class that he will wear fashionable north London nonsense that mark their sacrifice</p>

<p>Resist all you like - that democracy - just dont ridicule those who died and are remembered by it.</p>

<p>Have fun with Politics et al - thats the way of the World.</p>

<p>Remembrance Day ?  .... thats about the people who died as a person, not a symbol of (insert favorite cause) ..</p>

<p>In this rising Age of  Spin, that simple fact is getting distorted, and Remembrance needs setting to one side of that ClapTrap <br/>.<br/>..... Remembrance is a Country Mile away from it, whatever contrived distorted scenario anyone cooks up.</p>

<p>[Furious response to "ridicule those who died" removed myself]  I lost family in both wars.  I never knew my grandfathers.</p>

<p>Dont be silly .... its a simple statement, hardly ridicules anyone, least of all Servicemen and Women.</p>

<p>You are not the only one who has Services connections .... take a deep breath ... Ye Gods .................</p>

<p>My point was that a white poppy would be Remembrance of a particular kind.  I'm no pacifist myself, but I think that to denounce it is morally equivalent to denouncing conscientious objectors.</p>

<p>Why bring Northern Irish Catholics into this silly discussion?  The remembrance service is not denominational, it isnt even held in a church.</p>

<p>FYI <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_poppy#Republic_of_Ireland" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</a></p>

<p>If I take offense at a harp or a shamrock will the Irish stop wearing it?</p>

<p>Whether he understands it or not he will do what most of his ilk do and stand there with it on and quietly seethe. What concerns me more is the way people like him might be likely to think should they ever (God forbid) have to make any major decisions like those in WWII for instance - his sort of upstart is generally a servant of ideology rather than naturally likely to embrace any necessary sense of perspective.</p>

<p>If the Labour Party had had its way we would have ended up with another appeasing PM when Chamberlain resigned.</p>

<p>Nice comment - right up there on the intelligence scale.</p>
