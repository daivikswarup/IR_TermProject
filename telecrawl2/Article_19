<div class="body"><p> Worse, this goes to competence. Even those who do not warm to Mr Osborne acknowledge his skill at the great game of politics. It is in large part this grandmaster status that makes him the favourite to succeed David Cameron. Simply, people don't love Mr Osborne, but they think he's good at what he does. </p><p> So what now? There'll be plenty of people telling him to back down, soften the tax credit cuts (<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11944905/Cutting-tax-credits-to-reduce-inheritance-tax-punishes-work-and-rewards-unearned-privilege.html">here's my suggestion from last week</a>) and make the package acceptable to the Lords (and Tory colleagues). </p><p> But that would have costs, possibly severe ones. It would prove that Mr Osborne is vulnerable, susceptible to pressure – mortal. He'd stay in the race to succeed Mr Cameron, but he'd take a wound that would slow him up; he might go from prohibitive favourite to just one of the pack. Losing favourite status can be damaging. </p><p>

</div><p></p><p> The other option carries bigger risks, and bigger rewards: stand firm, lay siege to the Lords and wage bloody political war to pass the tax credits package as written. Make this a point of fundamental political principle, the defining battle of the Parliament and his career: who governs Britain – unelected lefty peers, or George Osborne? That would be no mean feat, since it might require some controversial measures (100 Tory chums made peers, anyone?) and mean turning public opinion (broadly sceptical about cutting tax credits) against the Lords. </p><p> One thing is clear: he needs to kill the Lords' tax credit timetable. <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/georgeosborne/11951056/Tax-credits-what-are-they-who-claims-them-and-why-is-everyone-so-angry-about-the-cuts.html" target="_blank">Three million people being told you're making them worse off</a> one year into the Parliament is one thing. The same cuts falling a year before the 2020 general election is quite another. </p><p> I mentioned 2012. Another part of Mr Osborne's recent success with colleagues is his ability to know when to learn from setbacks (he softened his harsh public person) and when to stand firm (he didn't waver on the 50p tax rate). If he can pull off a similar trick this time, acknowledging and accepting public doubts about tax credits without budging on his fundamental goals, he may well be truly unbeatable in the succession game. </p><p> Mr Osborne loves the political game, perhaps even too much. A great deal rides on the next hand he plays. </p><p> <iframe class="tg-card" data-id="002a4ab2-88b9-4c76-965b-c50de54b8a43" frameborder="0" height="259" id="player1" scrolling="no" src="http://cf.eip.telegraph.co.uk/breakoutCards/002a4ab2-88b9-4c76-965b-c50de54b8a43.html" style="float: left; margin: 0px 0px 10px; height: 1124px;" width="540"></iframe><script src="http://cf.eip.telegraph.co.uk/assets/_scripts/embed-card.js"></script>  </p></div>
