<div class="body"><p> Mr Corbyn will never be prime minister. I have no idea whether he knows this, but I have yet to talk to a Labour MP with a different view. Every action he takes drives his party’s prospects of success under him further towards the infinitesimally small. Insofar as the public knows or cares about what he is doing, it knows he positioned the party under the heel of pressure groups whose views are extreme, unrepresentative and highly damaging to British interests. </p><p> <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Emily Thornberry " height="387" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03113/thornberry-3_3113699b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Emily Thornberry </span><span class="credit">  Photo: PA</span></span></span></span></p><p> He, and those with whom he surrounds himself, wish to pursue ideas that hardly anyone in Britain shares, because hardly anyone in Britain believes they will lead to a happier, more prosperous and more secure nation. The effect of the Stop the War Coalition on the party is especially baleful, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/12089578/Emily-Thornberry-I-dont-know-why-Jeremy-Corbyn-made-me-shadow-defence-secretary.html">and its effect last week was to have the moderate Maria Eagle replaced as defence spokesman by the unilateralist Lady Nugee</a>, who operates under the nom de guerre of Emily Thornberry. Ken Livingstone, another communicant, then suggested our membership of Nato was up for review, something even the ruling junta felt it had to contradict – for the moment. </p><p> Stop the War is the latest holding pen for Leftist militants. Mr Corbyn is one of its adornments. Its website argues for “a world of peace”. Its members are direct heirs of the imbeciles, such as the late Eric Hobsbawm, who in September 1939 deplored our declaration of war on Germany because their idol, the fratricidal maniac Josef Stalin, had agreed with Hitler to oppress the whole of eastern Europe between them. </p><p> <script height="349px" src="http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.js#pbid=ZTIxYmJjZDM2NWYzZDViZGRiOWJjYzc5&amp;ec=x4dTQxMDE6AcuDSx3rUjJZFZDT1HYzzN" width="620px"></script><iframe frameborder="0" height="349px" src="http://player.ooyala.com/iframe.html#pbid=ZTIxYmJjZDM2NWYzZDViZGRiOWJjYzc5&amp;ec=x4dTQxMDE6AcuDSx3rUjJZFZDT1HYzzN&amp;docUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fpolitics%2FJeremy_Corbyn%2F12090061%2FCorbyns-Labour-is-now-an-irrelevant-cult.html" webkitallowfullscreen="true" width="620px"></iframe></p><p> Anyone who wishes to defend our people is, <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12045535/Jeremy-Corbyn-and-Stop-The-War-deserve-each-other.html">in the eyes of Stop the War</a>, by definition someone who doesn’t want peace. Anyone who doesn’t want peace is, also by their definition, a warmonger. One departed shadow minister committed the crime of saying that the attacks in Paris in November were not the West’s fault. He failed to understand the insane, extremist dialectic that is poisoning his party: which is that when radicalised Islamist youths decide to machine-gun people in a rock concert, or shoot a room full of journalists, or blow up a train, the victims have bloody well asked for it. </p><p>

Ed Miliband sacked her as shadow attorney-general for her loathsome snobbery, but she was guilty of far worse: she was guilty of a determination to erase the traces of patriotism and liberty in this country that she and her kind share with those who ran eastern Europe for Stalin, Khrushchev and Brezhnev from the Forties to the Eighties. </p><p> I have asked before, and must ask again: what do the hundreds of thousands of disfranchised Labour activists, on behalf of millions of moderate Labour voters who would sooner drink the proverbial phial of prussic acid than vote for ideals such as these, plan to do about this? </p><p> <span class="ssImg "><img alt="Candidate for British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the press at a press conference in London, Britain, 07 August 2015." height="387" src="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03406/Jeremy-Corbyn__3406649b.jpg" version="b" width="620"/><span class="artImageExtras" style="max-width:620px;"><span class="ingCaptionCredit"><span class="caption">Jeremy Corbyn speaks to the press at a press conference in London </span><span class="credit">  Photo: EPA</span></span></span></span></p><p> I salute the brave people who resigned last week rather than bear any more of this nonsense; but what do the likes of Miss Eagle, or Lord Falconer, or Hilary Benn think they are going to achieve by staying?

There has to be a confrontation. </p><p> The other obvious question is this: if a man feels he must have a reshuffle every time someone disagrees with him, and then takes a week to do it, and then loses more colleagues by mistake, how can he be expected to run a country? Happily, the answer need never concern us. </p></div>
