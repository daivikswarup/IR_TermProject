<comment>We've been upping the state minimum wage since at least the 1990s (when I started my first job). This is a fairly typical piece of legislation for Oregon at this point, with the exception of the density-tier system, which I don't think previous wage-hike bills had. Every few years, like clockwork, a minimum wage raise bill gets passed through the state legislature, and every few years, like clockwork, business owners come out of the woodwork to claim that it'll ruin them - but, on a level, it never has. I'm proud of the way my state has consistently legislated in favor of low-wage workers for decades, on both sides of the aisle, and I hope that we continue the tradition for a long time to come.</comment>

<comment>I think Oregon is the most We the People state in our nation. I'm a believer of Direct Democracy approaches to politics. Any efforts to take decision making away from politicians puts the power into our hands. The ease of the initiative ballot in your state is what I'm interested in. Many states barely have ballot proposals and Oregon probably has the easiest issues voting system.Do you feel that it is a good thing? Do you feel more empowered because of it?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, we definitely make it easy to bring ballot measures before voters, and I, for one, love that - even when votes don't go the way I'd hoped. It's a good way to keep a finger on the political pulse of our state - the real political pulse - at all times, and it helps contextualize and prioritize issues in a way that I don't think I'd be able to enjoy in most other states. In other words, if a bill overwhelmingly passes or fails, and I voted the other way (and have strong feelings about it), then I have de facto marching orders - or at least talking points - for the next voting cycle. I know where to focus my efforts for change. I get to engage, in my small way, with those around me, and try to address the issue. In short, I get to be a part of the democratic process, from the ground up.</comment>

<comment>Exactly how I would feel.I'm a Bernie fan and I wish he would at some point speak to this issue. I suppose it is a "state's rights issue" but I see it as a "Citizen's Democracy issue" and he of all the candidates does speak to a People's Revolution and having more issues to vote on directly should be a part of that.I lived in your state for about a year back in 1998 and loved it. Here in Michigan I am so frustrated with state politics, the Flint Water Crisis among many issues that erupt and the people don't seem to have any method to redress our anger. We are gerrymandered into Republican control and trying to recall our governor is going to be a monumental task, a large amount of petition signatures in a short period of time.</comment>

<comment>I was born in Oregon. Newport. I left that socialist shit state long ago.So you think its' cool to legislate a minimum wage?  You everseen a balance sheet? I didn't think so. You wouldn't be a libtard if you had.Kindest  Regards</comment>

<comment>I loved living in Oregon for many of the same reasons as Crud Bonemeal's post above...  but HATED the direct democracy stuff.We hire experts to make policy for a reason...  because public policy is complex.  Our elected officials are elected to balance those decisions, and if we don't like them, we can vote against them in the next election.  I don't need to be doing their job for them, and it would take hours to really understand and vote on the dozen-plus initiatives often on the ballot.Same with Oregon's insanely short term limits - every year the legislative process breaks down, because the huge crop of new reps don't know eachother, don't now legislative procedures, and don't know how to cut deals...  and because they are gonna be gone immediately anyway, they have full blanche to pander (because they won't have to live with the long-term messes they create).  Term limits are a copout for voters too lazy to actually pay attention to what their elected leaders are doing.  That forces a ton of stuff to "direct democracy", which again is based more on how folks "feel" than on what actually makes sense.And I say that as someone that often "feels" pretty close to the generally left-of-center Oregon electorate.Anyway, this sounds overly negative on Oregon which isn't my intent (I LOVED my time living in OR, and they do far more correct than wrong), but no place is perfect.</comment>

<comment>True, nowhere is perfect, but our legislature actually does get quite a bit done. They're surprisingly productive, and popular politicians often serve for decades by moving up into national or executive offices. Our legislative sessions are intermittent, and the pay reflects that, so in order to serve, you also need to be a working Oregonian with a "day job," and you need to be willing to tackle things quickly and incisively to clear the agenda before the session closes for the year. Although all of that certainly has downsides, I think that in general, the good outweighs the bad.</comment>

<comment>And it probably helps that Oregon is more politically homogenous than Congress.</comment>

<comment>Actually, we have one of the most polarized electorates in the Union, by the measure of the Likert scale.</comment>

<comment>The flip side is California. I don't know how easy it is to get something on the ballot in OR, but in California special interests can easily get whatever they want on the ballot. Basically envision Super PACs sponsoring ballot measures. While I appreciate the opportunity to vote for so many things, there are some dangers too. Also, the state assembly now is only able to determine about 1/3 of the state budget now thanks to passed ballot measures. While one might say that is a good thing, it makes the budget process less flexible, which makes things difficult when revenue takes a big hit (such as in 2008-2010).</comment>

<comment>Yep! Sure pup, I am a big believer in government controlling my bottom line. If they control what I pay, you reckon they ought to control my capital expenditures. Damn were you born stupid or did you rack up huge college debt to arrive at this point?Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>Pup?Well, pussycat, you clearly didn't even finish high school because you don't have any reading comprehension. Whatever drivel you're talking about has nothing to do with the subject I was discussing which was ballot initiatives and Direct Democracy.No kind regards for you. You don't deserve them.</comment>

<comment>"it'll ruin them ... it never has"Four of the consequences are not seen or felt, you would not sense them.a) A higher minimum wage is one more obstacle for the formation of new businesses, startups. On its own it might not have an effect, but together with many other small changes it does. This affects job growth.b) A higher minimum wage means that the already successful, the already wealthy, the already large and more efficient companies are favored. This contributes to income disparities by making it more difficult to move up economically.c) Companies are more willing to spend money as they grow on new technology to increase the productivity of the workers they have than to hire more workers, so there is less job growth.d) An increase in the minimum wage ripples through the whole wage structure of a company, increasing wages for all employees, causing a company need  for all employees to be more productive, not just those at the bottom. That means companies make do with fewer workers, at all levels.</comment>

<comment>You know, these are the same musty talking points trotted out every time. Oregon's numbers speak for themselves. The rest is just fantastical thinking.</comment>

<comment>The rest is just from practical experience in working for, owning or managing small businesses over many years, in several states and countries.</comment>

<comment>Claim whatever anecdotal experience you want. We've been steadily upping our minimum wage pretty much every year for the past 20 years, with a net positive effect to show for it. The numbers don't lie.</comment>

<comment>Dismiss logic, common sense, experience in favor of your nose for musty ideas. Go on. Numbers can only talk about what they have been assigned to measure.</comment>

<comment>Sure Cowboy! I can't wait to move my companies to your state! Heh! Heh! Circle jerk your little friends crud and bow to the awesomeness  of socialismget used to it.!  On the other hand, maybe you know a little about tough life.My top hand is a grad of Angola State Pen. Black as the ace of spades!He will park your three bedroom ranch in his garage in Los Cabos.Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>of course the cost of living in Oregon is among the highest in the country. .Don't you see a connection between that and  raising the min. wage every few years</comment>

<comment>Quote: "it would seem like a straightforward calculation involving supply and demand" and that's your problem right there, it is not, and if you think a little bit it shouldn't seem like it is either. On the demand side, things work out as expected, if a company can get an hour worth of work for say 8$ it would demand more hours of work that if it has to pay 10$ for the exact same thing. On the supply side on the other work does not function like a normal product in the economic sense. How many hours would you work if pay was 10$, how many would you do for 8$, for a classic economic product you should work more hours at 10$ an hour than at 8$ and spend less time enjoying your free time. But most humans prefer to life inside a house instead of on the street, like to wear clothing instead of running naked and prefer eating on a regular basis. Meaning at low wages they will try to work more hours at the lower salary, not less. So this whole supply/ demand theory with an optimal equilibrium wage that clears the market just doesn't work. The theory is great for a lot of products but for (low pay) work it just doesn't apply.</comment>

<comment>Anything over 40 hours is time and a half. What people fail to realize in this equation is that labor is a commodity and is subject to all the laws that govern other commodities. When it is plentiful it is cheap. When it's scarce it is dear. Entry level simply isn't worth the same as experienced labor. Experience adds value to the commodity of labor. The demand side is always looking for value for it's money.And yes. The supply /demand curve works for everything in the marketplace.</comment>

<comment>"The supply /demand curve works for everything in the marketplace."  Not if there are regulations that alter the free market. You know, like minimum wage laws, overtime laws, laws against hiring discrimination, employee safety laws, fiduciary responsibility laws.</comment>

<comment>Nonetheless. evderything is subject to supply and demand. Reulations and laws tend to skew the market. When the market becomes burdensome to one side or the other they will respond seeking another advantage.You see..You can demand that an employer raise wages out of proportion to the value given the employer then has other options. He can raise prices. He can move to a less demading area. he can close his doors.</comment>

<comment>What you are saying is that the labor demand works like one would expect, the lower the price, the higher the demand and vice versa, as I have written in my original post. But the supply curve of labor does not work as that of any other commodity. The labor supply does not always increase with wage increase and fall with wage decreases. There is some kind of curve that describes the supply of labor for a given wage, but it is not simply a strictly increasing curve as it is for any normal commodity. That means there may be multiple crossings of the supply and demand curve or even none at all. But the idea that there is a single stable free market equilibrium point and any regulation that moves the price away from it just creates a mismatch between supply and demand is just wrong for labor. It holds for all commodities with a nice decreasing demand curve and an increasing supply curve but labor just isn't a commodity where this holds.</comment>

<comment>No. What I'm saying is for a commodity to cammand a price it must first have value. Minimum wage gets less value because it has less experience. The market is always in flux.</comment>

<comment>$12.50/hr. is slightly under 85% of $14.75/hr.  Can people in rural areas consistently expect their rent, food, utility bills, and other things to cost only 85% of what it costs in higher-pay tracts?  If they travel to Portland, can they expect to only pay 85% of sticker price because they're paid in a poorer area?If not, then why the flying red fascis would we approve of paying them less?  If the larger economy is doing well but the worker is still struggling to get by, all you've done is shuffle the numbers instead of actually improving the problem!</comment>

<comment>Your salary is generally based on the region you live in, not where you may or may not travel to. About 2 seconds of googling shows that a 1 bedroom apartment is about $1500 in Portland and $650 in less populated areas. It's more than reasonable to expect that living in a city is more expensive.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't it depend on the city, how many people are fleeing to it from rural areas?  Aren't there many city available things that are cheaper than those in rural areas, such as advanced health car, top entertainment? Some of these might be expensive in the city, but are fabulously expensive in rural areas because they are not available unless you are in the top 1% of the 1%.</comment>

<comment>I live in rural Oregon. According to the National Low Income Housing Coalition's affordability calculator (and my personal experience), in my county a renter would need to make $10.67 an hour at 40 hours a week to afford to live in a one-bedroom apartment at the fair market price of $555 a month. In the Portland area the same worker would need to make $15.25 an hour to afford an identical one-bedroom apartment. Paying workers $15 an hour in rural Oregon is significantly above a "living wage" but would devastate the farms and other ag-related businesses that make up the backbone of our economy. By paying unskilled workers in my area $12.50 instead of $14.75, Oregon is still giving them a "living wage" but stemming the loss of jobs that would put them on unemployment.</comment>

<comment>Ms Lam and Readers: As per Ms Lam's recently reported monthly recaps of the DOL's jobs numbers, the current labor force participation rate is very low in historical comparisons. January's DOL jobs numbers showed that 252,397,000 people composed the US noninstitutional pool of potential workers; with 158,335,000 of these individuals actively seeking jobs (in the active labor force). Thus, January's DOL jobs report showed a participation rate of only 62.7%; computed as follows: [(158335000/252397000) x 100 = 62.7%]. And, with a current US population of about 323,050,000 people, the noninstitutional population would amount to about 78.1% of this total pool of potential workers, computed as follows: [(252397000/323050000) x 100 = 78.1%]. A higher minimum wage should entice more workers to enter the labor force and drive the active labor force participation rate upwards. This, in turn, should help the overall US economy realize a higher proportion of potential production on its total GDP production possibilities' frontier, or curve. To briefly recap: [(323050000 x 0.781 x 0.627) = 158193000, a close approximation of the active labor force].[John Joseph Laffiteau MS in Econ; Tues., Feb. 23, 2016, 1:37 p.m.; Greenville, NC]</comment>

<comment>You can't legislate people out of poverty. They will continue to make poor decisions with money, get a useless college degree instead of learning a trade, then complain that the job that they've selected still pays too little or they can't find work as a/an *insert highly paid, oversaturated job market here*. If you don't want to work for little to no money, apply yourself, work your ass off like everyone else that has ever succeeded in life, move to another location, and/or take responsibility for your own life. Making a law so that someone has someone pay  you more doesn't make you worth more, it makes you a leech and a whiner.</comment>

<comment>Why should any college degree be "useless?" Do you realize just how much of the 1% bait you've swallowed hook, line, and sinker? It was only thirty years ago that employment counselors told people that a college degree meant that a job seeker could research, derive conclusions, and write those conclusions up. In the USA of the time, that was supposed to guarantee you a career-track job that may have paid modestly in the first few years but that would blossom (again, guaranteed) into an executive career with a comfortable living.Instead of protesting the loss of opportunity, you're siding with the rich. Why is that?</comment>

<comment>I know it's hard for people like you to believe, but a college degree in a saturated profession is useless. I don't know where you think I am siding with the rich by saying people should work their asses off to succeed, unless you think that believing in hard work is siding with the rich. The world is very different from 30 years ago. People could indeed do what you say, and they chose to go into the fields that are super-saturated today (Law, IT, etc...). Today's world, people are still going to college for those jobs, but there are already people in them, so they, in fact, have useless degrees. Just because someone made a poor decision for their future doesn't mean that businesses should have to pay them more. Your 1% line just further shows that you don't know what you are talking about, because that is exactly what anyone brings up when they want to play the victim card to feel better about not achieving, instead of having an actual conversation.</comment>

<comment>Because what you're saying is just propaganda by the rich. Work hard and you will succeed? Oh, you didn't succeed? Why you must not have worked hard! And that's a load of bull!The world is very different from 30 years ago? But no, it's not merely different. The rich created a Second Gilded Age. This was done on purpose, deliberately.There is less and less opportunity in the USA as the rich choke the Main Street economy. We can have a conversation about that, but if you disagree that it is happening, no conversation can take place.</comment>

<comment>Wow, talk about being a pessimist and closed minded as well!No conversation? Really.One of the strengths of the US system is that there is so much opportunity that if it is reduced somewhat it still offers a lot. And it is reduced, but not because of the rich but because of politicians listening to pessimistic voters who have no understanding or experience with basic economics, nor what it is that has made the US such a dynamic culture and economy in the first place.</comment>

<comment>What is your definition of "success"?  I suspect it is totally defined in terms of material goods.  Work hard and you will gain the satisfaction that you were a productive person who accomplished a lot in life and worked with other people as a team to create and provide products and services that  others valued and enjoyed.  Okay, you may go home and find you are driving a ten year old Chevy rather than a new Mercedes.  Do you then regard yourself as unsuccessful?That is why of the two sins, Greed and Envy, Envy is the most insidious. It can destroy lives.  (Greed usually has a quick comeuppance you can recover from.)</comment>

<comment>".. A college degree in a saturated profession is useless..." No, it is not now and never was.One third of the students at the small school I went to many years ago were history majors.  The reason was simple, history had the fewest specific course requirements.  You can't look at it being a bad thing simply because there are just so many archivists that large companies may require.A college degree, at least one from a reputable college, means that you have writing and other communication skills that are valuable for every job. You have also demonstrated that you know how to learn.Recently someone sold me season tickets for a minor professional sports team.  He came and delivered them in person, and I asked about his job and background.  The marketing department of the team had five members, only one of which had a business degree in marketing. The others had degrees in philosophy, history, music and English.</comment>

<comment>So the four majored in something they couldn't get a job in and took a marketing job instead.  Sorry, it doesn't make much sense, considering the cost of college.Of all the people I've met with psychology degrees (and they were legion), only one was actually working in the field.</comment>

<comment>Betty Rubble, it makes a lot of sense.Years ago the some professional society in Canada ran advertisements in the national newspapers with the following headline, in big letters:"So you got your degree in Honors English. Now what do you do?"Underneath were two check boxes. The first was "Get a job checking people's grammar".The second was "Become the President of the Bank of Montreal".  That is the box that was checked.Below it was a goofy college yearbook picture of a guy who was President of the Bank of Montreal at the time.I have been to many venture capital conferences at which discussions were held on the topic "What do you look for in the leaders of the companies you invest in."  Invariably technical skills were toward the end.  The skills that were most important were people skills, writing and speaking skills. Exactly the kind of things you get better at by being an English or Philosophy major rather than a computing scientist or engineer.This was a long time ago so I can't remember the reference, but at one major university, after twenty five years, those with liberal arts degrees were making more money than those with engineering or science degrees.The conclusion I get from this is that it is good advice to study what you love at university, follow your passion so that you don't spend the rest of your life regretting that you didn't. Studying computing science because you think it will get you a job, even though you hate it might lead to a debt free career, but you are likely not going to be very good at your work and you certainly will not be a happy individual.</comment>

<comment>"A college degree, at least one from a reputable college, means that you have writing and other communication skills that are valuable for every job. You have also demonstrated that you know how to learn."NOT TRUE.A college degree in itself not automatic proof of intelligence, of having any useful skills, having the ability to do anything useful or even a sign being smart or having common sense.There are plenty of idiots out there who went to a "reputable college".</comment>

<comment>I do wish they'd push more trades and less college.But I think it's hard to guess what field of study would be fruitful--an acquaintance trained as a medical assistant (health care!  hot!) and is now working retail.  A friend took years to land something that used his electrical engineering degree. And moving takes money, and some folks are encumbered with relatives who need care etc., which can affect mobility, job training, etc.</comment>

<comment>"Oregon’s tiered approach is an attempt to try and avoid this consequence."Shouldn't that be "try to avoid this"? The sentence makes no sense as is.</comment>

<comment>How very pedantic of you, Scott.</comment>

<comment>The sentence does indeed make sense. It means to try and achieve, not merely to try and perhaps fail. Try and be tolerant.</comment>

<comment>There should be a comma after "try" and "be" in the last sentence.</comment>

<comment>Check out the Living Wage Calculator at livingwage.mit.edu.You can find out what a living wage is for a single adult, an adult and one child, etc., in any part of the country and see the area minimum wage and poverty wage.It also explains the methodology and the costs in the different areas.It very much supports what Oregon has done.Portland metro living wage (2,348,247) is $11.25/hr. Salem (the capital, 400,408 in the metro area) $10.44,Rural Lake County has a population of 7,838 and a living wage of $9.51.Remember, this is a **living wage.**</comment>

<comment>Once problem this does not address is how increasing the min wage harms young workers just entering the workforce.  They should have included a tier system where those under 18 would continue to make $7.25, then gradually increase it till the worker is 22 and then it matches the the rest of the region.  Youth unemployment is at catastrophic levels and this would help alleviate that.  Also it has no mechanism if there is an economic downturn.  the 500,000 job loss projection was based on a full employment economy growing at 3.5% (well above what we have currently) and the report states that during a downturn that figure could be much higher.</comment>

<comment>A tiered, high minimum wage might work in Oregon because it's such a very, very white state—2% African American vs. 13% nationally.  Still, realize that many teenaged African Americans are already priced out of the entry level labor market.  Increasing the minimum wage in dense cities where many of these young men and women live may well price them out of the labor market forever.  Unlike their richer, white suburban cohorts, they may not have the resources to pull them selves out of dire economic circumstances with more education.  So in effect a high minimum wage will sentence a large number of black teenagers to a life on the dole, or worse.But that may not matter in really white Oregon, where the majority of rich, white people can use the higher minimum wage law to feel more virtuous.</comment>

<comment>"Would it cause businesses to move? Decrease the number of jobs? Reduce turnover?"More likely,  increase the flow of illegal workers willing to work for less.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure the rationale in the article is accurate stating "$15 goes a lot less far in metropolitan areas than it does in more rural ones."  I grew up in rural Oklahoma and still visit my family in my rural hometown.  The price of gas, milk and bread are higher there due to lack of competition and higher costs of shipping to remote areas rather than to concentrated metropolitan areas.  I remember we would shop locally for the basic stuff when we need to at the little grocery store in our hometown, but when we needed to really stock up we would go into the nearest bigger city to the chain grocery store there.  So, although the tiered idea sounds good, they need to look more closely at cost of goods in both places before making that determination.</comment>

<comment>Why minimum wage should never be increased or even exist! When I first got married in 1970: minimum wage was $1.25 per hour.  With that one hour I could buy 3 gallons of gas (4 if there was a gas war going) and a pack of Winstons.  I could buy a dinner at The Frayser Maid (a greasy spoon restaurant) that consisted of 1 meat, three vegetables, 2 rolls and a large glass of tea and still have 25 cents left over. A McDonald hamburger was 15 cents. Fries were a dime and a medium drink was 10 cents.  Everything else was priced accordingly. Every time minimum wage has been increased, an hour’s minimum wage has bought less and less.  Increasing minimum wage just increases the cost of everything exponentially.</comment>

<comment>How does this not run afoul of the Equal Protection clause? A state law should apply to all citizens of the state equally. If Portland or Washington County want a minimum wage that is higher than the state minimum wage, let them pass their own law to raise it in their jurisdiction.</comment>

<comment>How does upping the minimum wage across the board cause job loss unless the business goes out of business entirely?Businesses still need the same number of people to perform the jobs. Businesses will need to hike prices, but not enough to kill demand.There was similar predictions of economic doom when the minimum wage went from 85 cents per hour to $1.00 per hour. The result of that increase was an economic boost as people had more to spend.</comment>

<comment>There is only one thing more ignorant then raising the minimum wage to these amounts, make it tiered for different areas. So someone flipping burgers in Portland makes $2 more per hour than someone in Bend. I do not know about you, but it seems like the same job to me. It does not matter what the cost of living is in the area. What matters is the job responsibilities and they are the same in both cities.In a couple of years people washing dishes will be making almost as much as my wife, who is a cook and has been working at the same place for 7 years. Employers cannot afford the minimum wage hikes and they sure as heck cannot afford to raise their highly trained staff wages to reflect the raises of minimum wage.This type of liberal social justice crap will be the ruin of many businesses in the state of Oregon.</comment>

<comment>Watch the cost of living rise even higher in Oregon</comment>
