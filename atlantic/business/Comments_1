<comment>"If they couldn’t prove that, compensation was often considered a replacement for wages forgone during a period of incarceration, and like wages, it was taxed."Except when it isn't. For example, here's what the state of Louisiana gives out."Compensation shall be calculated at a rate of fifteen thousand dollars per year incarcerated not to exceed a maximum total amount of one hundred fifty thousand dollars."For Glenn Ford, who was released after 30 years in jail, $150K/30yrs = $5K/yr, or about $2.40/hr, assuming working 8 hrs a day for 30 yrs.http://www.theatlantic.com/nat...</comment>

<comment>I guess we're lucky they're not deducting room and board.</comment>

<comment>So when receiving their compensation, now the fact that it is tax free will be taken into account and they will get less.  What exactly happened here besides optics?</comment>

<comment>America just loves to punish people. What a punitive bunch of humans we are. Meanwhile, we have a government that doesn't do jack sh*t except pass obscure laws that penalize those who can't get ahead.</comment>

<comment>As a society we have to take care of the wrongfully convicted. When they are released we should make the transition back to regular life as easy as possible. They're coming back in to life with not that much money and the money that they have shouldn't be taken from them.</comment>

<comment>Federal & STATE "Judges" are CORRUPT. IOWA persecuted Benton Mackezie for choosing cannabis oil to treat HIS cancer. Judge Henry Latham II threatened Benton with jail & CONTEMPT and ORDERED Benton NOT tell the jury the whole truth about his cancer treatment with cannabis oil and how it shrinks tumors. IOWA took away Benton's oil, his tumors returned, he was found guilty by an uniformed jury and sentenced to probation. He died the next month. Search: Benton Mackenzie. RIP You Tube: Emperor of Hemp, & aka TOMMY CHONG, & BOUGHT, & LAWLESS AMERICA</comment>

<comment>Except that they're rarely innocent. Often they've just had a conviction set aside for technical reasons or some minor error in their trials. Or many, especially in the case of drug convictions, pled guilty to a lesser offense they weren't technically guilty of. I remember one such case where a fellow pled guilty to a possession of one kind of illegal drug, and it turned out he had been possessing another. Or cases where the defendant honestly believed he had drugs when he'd been snookered by a higher-up dealer into buying baking soda. Whoop de do. Glad they're back out on the streets, aren't you?</comment>

<comment>There will always be those who say that. My opinion is that you are just stupid.</comment>

<comment>Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law. Regardless of whether they are innocent or not, if they are not guilty (a different legal concept) they should not be locked up. If they were locked up anyway, that is wrong, and they deserve compensation.</comment>

<comment>How many of the 149 people referenced in this article fit your description? You must know since you say most of them are not really innocent.  Details, please.Innocence is a "technicality". Who knew!</comment>

<comment>My point was that the 149 figure isn't people who are "innocent." And based on my quick viewing of the document explaining how they arrived at it, I am completely correct. As to what proportion actually appeared to be innocent, I can't say, as the authors don't appear to be too interested in that minor detail. The inference would be, I think, that it's not very many.</comment>

<comment>No, you are completely wrong. The only possible justification for such a claim is if you have personal knowledge that one of the people released were   guilty of the crime they were sent up for.   The authors are not interested in that "detail" because the article is about taxes.   All the details are undoubtedly public record.</comment>

<comment>I was, very clearly I think, not referring to the Atlantic article, but to the document it cites to in support of the claim about the number of so-called exonerations.And, it does, as I said, confirm that they are not using actual, proven innocence as their definition of "exonerated."</comment>

<comment>Yes, I know, I read the Michigan document, too.   Is there one of the detailed examples that you particularly have issue with?   Do you think that Bobby Johnson killed Herbert Fields? Far's I can tell none of the 127 were re-tried because of some ticky-tacky trial error and then found not-guilty. (But they really did it)  They were released because, based on all the facts, there should have been no charges brought in the first place.  If that's not "proving innocence", please tell me what is.   What more would it take for you to conclude Johnson should not have gone to jail?I do agree to a certain extent that those  holding a bag of oregano thinking it was pot might not be in exactly the same category as Quentin Carter but the fact remains, had the facts been known there would have been no trial, not even an arrest.</comment>

<comment>1200 Americans die each day from TOBACCO, yet it is marijuana "offenders" that are targeted for prosecution, incarceration. Over 100,000 people each year are "murdered" by prescription medication, taken AS PRESCRIBED, and yet taxpayers are defrauded with marijuana related prosecutions and incarcerations. FLOURIDE CAUSES more cancers than any other chemical and over half America;s water systems are intentionally poisoned despite the LANCET journal (Vol. 13, issue 3, pgs 330-338, March 2014) classifying flouride as a Neurotoxin (Brain Poison)...and there are NO Investigations, No Prosecutions, No incarcerations for the real criminals, like Rockefeller and gang, who cheats disabled veterans, like myself, for telling the truth: VACCINES CAUSED GULF WAR SYNDROME. He had me arrested on a trumped up charge. Google: Kenneth Tennant (Domestic Terrorism: USA vs Veterans and the First Amendment) & You Tube: AMERICAN VETERAN: Discarded and Forgotten, by Gary Null, & BOUGHT, & Dr. Carley ("VACCINES ARE Bio-Chem Weapons of Mass Disease), & Dr. Suzanne Humphries...Why am I still fighting the CORRUPT VA for disability compensation ? The SSA is worse. The Iowa delegation remains criminally Indifferent. I believe these statements to be true. -Dr. Kenneth Tennant,  KTennantDC@Gmail.com</comment>

<comment>Dr. Tennant is a fraud.The good news is that Obamacare does cover mental health treatments. The bad news is you haven't taken advantage of that.</comment>

<comment>I'm certain most people will support this, as it's both fair and just, and honestly the least we can do.However it's worth noting that stuff like this - Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act, 2015 - is what adds pages to the tax code and more work for the IRS. So next time someone promises to shrink the tax code to the size of an A4 by removing "special" tax breaks and deductions, please ensure that part of that A4 is devoted to retaining the Wrongful Convictions Tax Relief Act of 2015.</comment>

<comment>In the UK, exonerated prisoners are billed for their stay upon release, such as in this case - Man wrongly jailed for three years charged £7,000 by Home Office for 'board and lodging'</comment>
