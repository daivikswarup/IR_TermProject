<comment>Eh. It's not a scourge. It's just stuff that needs done. I'm not seeing us changing the course of human history and the weight of every human culture ever. It's so common I wonder if there's a genetic component. I will concede that the situation must improve for women and girls in developing countries. Five hours a day really would get in the way of school and work! Also, if you fellows want to help, it's very nice. My philosophy is don't expect it, and you won't stew over it, but you'll be pleasantly delighted when he does help.:)</comment>

<comment>Your post is exactly the problem. "you'll be pleasantly delighted when he does help"  excuse me but if two are living in a house then two are making the mess and two are responsible for chores..."Also if you fellows want to help, it's very nice" Really? So it's just a whim for men to pitch in? Sorry sister but in my world EVERYONE takes part in making the house run because everyone lives in the house.</comment>

<comment>Does everyone, on the flipside, contribute toward paying for the house to run?</comment>

<comment>In my case I don't work outside the house at this point (unless you count me being a late in life starving artist). But I do contribute 75% or more of our income (trust funds). We are able to hire housework done but that still leaves quite a bit of daily stuff. Because my husband is still involved in our company I handle most of the repair calls, scheduling stuff etc. But where the real burden was happening was with our teens and my husband's mother being in a nursing home and my parents getting older. Between all this I was doing about 80 hours a week unpaid. Having to pick up my mother-in-laws meds every day (doc's wouldn't giver her a three month supply and refused to have all drugs ready on a certain day of the week) I made almost daily runs to Kroger then drove the hour to her nursing home. Once there I had to check on all her issues and then spend some time with her as she was lonely.My parents are in their 80's I have to make sure their house is clean, yard is kept up and bills paid. That was another 20 hours a week.Add in we have 5 children between the two of us and I had to go to the school meetings, help with homework, help fill out college forms, attend college visits.Then due to our company I was responsible for every employee birthday, special events, Christmas party, client gifts and client issuesAll unpaid.</comment>

<comment>Heh.  Between my wife and I, we have one living relative and no kids (infertility issues).  So, our house work fights are mostly over who has to put the dogs out before bed when it's 8 degrees outside.Well, really, our biggest fight is this:  She's a 'get cleaned up and do your running around early on Saturday' type, and I'm a 'get all the scuzzy cleaning and house stuff done so you can enjoy the weekend' type.  We typically do a mix of both that satisfies neither :p</comment>

<comment>My husband is like your wife. I want to go do something fun on Saturdays and he wants to do major yard work. He even bought a huge old, very old, truck just to haul landscaping stuff.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha.  You should see it in Germany.  Saturdays are for shopping and cleaning because Sunday is for your relatives coming over for coffee and homemade cake.  I'd shoot myself if I experienced a "traditional" German weekend, which sadly really is done by the majority of Germans.</comment>

<comment>I almost spit coffee at my computer screen when I saw the phrases "trust fund" and "able to hire help".</comment>

<comment>I am blessed and know it. But most of my friends aren't and I see the reality. Yes my income along with my husband's makes our lives so much easier but I am not blind or stupid. Most people in this country are struggling and financially hurting.</comment>

<comment>Don't feel guilty. You're blessed, that's awesome!</comment>

<comment>So Melinda Gates  thinks the federal government should not impose "maternity" leave policies. It should be left to "stronger family support".  The USA is one of two countries world-wide that does not offer PAID maternity leave for up to a year. Gee thanks Melinda. </comment>

<comment>gee, every other country is running out of money why don't we?</comment>

<comment>Wow, spending time with your senile mother is "unpaid labor." You make me sick.I hope Bernie taxes your trust fund to the cent.</comment>

<comment>Of course a man says this. Let's see how much time you spend with your elderly mother...no, you'll probably leave that woman's work to your wife/daughter/sister-laws/caregivers. It's YOU who makes us sick.</comment>

<comment>It's one of the fun aspects of The Atlantic. Any article whatsoever that even touches on women and girls always, always brings out eternally aggrieved males who on gender skew more like the fringe evangelical GOP, with the same zero self-awareness. It's the same ones who think it's okay for females to earn less for the same work - if not just stay home in the kitchen (i.e. Kasich, this week), act like they know more about females than females, deny the rape culture and think even little girls are "asking for it", believe it okay to use their religion to control females, cannot fathom any objection to male-only committees on female issues, and especially love to criticize the appearance of female politicians. </comment>

<comment>Be careful with open flames around that humongous straw man you just built there.</comment>

<comment>The difference here is I'm going off what you just told us, and you're blatantly making unfounded assumptions about me due to the fact that I am a man (or at least, my avatar is a man).Oh, and get a grip. Not everything is about you being a woman. If a man complained about being around his progeny and watching them grow into unique and free-thinking human beings full of agency, thoughts, hopes, dreams, and opinions, I'd give him a righteous scolding as well. It's not always about what's between your legs, sweetheart. </comment>

<comment>Also, this is the guilt language society uses to keep women doing the majority of unpaid labour. Ugh.</comment>

<comment>My mother in law is not senile and I love her. But I am the one who takes her to all her doctor appointments, shops for her, gets her meds and is her main source of family support. I love doing it but it is hard to take care of her, my parents, my children and my husband.My daughter graduated Yale with honors and I couldn't go because my mother in law needed medical help. My daughter was hurt. My husband's son got married and I made the church service but had to leave the reception within 15 minutes due to my mother in law needing me. My mother in law for some reason doesn't want her son (only child) to help because he is a man and this according to her is for women to do. She will only accept my help.My husband and I have not taken a vacation in more than 18 years due to his mother and my parents always needing us.We had planned our first time away..three days in Charleston last fall and had to cancel due to his mother needing me.  My step daughter is special needs and I also have to help her. Again I love her to bits but like many in my age bracket I am pulled too thin and in too many directions.If I also had to handle a paying job I wouldn't make it. My point is that for the women who do have to work and then do all the house/family stuff it's too much.</comment>

<comment>YOU CHOSE to take her to the DR., YOU CHOSE not to go to your daughter's graduation, YOU CHOSE to leave the reception, YOU would rather make these CHOICES instead of whatever thoughts and feelings you might have if you CHOSE otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Caregiving is labor, if you have no wife and someone else has to do it you have to pay for it, why is that reality so difficult to understand?  With your "reasoning" all unpaid work is not labor!</comment>

<comment>Well, if chores were distributed equally, more women would have more time for their careers, meaning more money to contribute.That "man/provider" and "woman/nurturer" dichotomy is exactly the problem. Not in couples who consciously agree to it, but to all women who had it imposed to them by stereotypes and biases.</comment>

<comment>Well, if chores were distributed equally, more women would have more time for their careers, meaning more money to contribute.Maybe.  Or maybe it would simply mean that two people would be disadvantaged in their careers instead of one.  I have a writer friend who's wife is an anesthesiologist.  He does 90% of the homework so that she can focus on her career.  It makes a lot more sense than splitting things 50/50.</comment>

<comment>Is it his choice?  Or is it a societal expectation that she takes for granted?</comment>

<comment>I don't know.  I haven't asked, but I don't think social expectations are much of an issue for them.That being said, social expectations rarely concern me much, either.  There is no such thing as a society without them, so I don't expect to live an unconstrained life and am not disappointed when I can't.</comment>

<comment>If it is not societal demand that has him performing unpaid labor at the cost of his career then it is not an applicable example</comment>

<comment>Of course it is.  Read what I wrote again - that a 50/50 split of home labor doesn't always make sense.If one person in a domestic partnership makes $100 and hour, and the other makes $10, you get a lot more return to the household from the latter partner focusing on the home duties so that they former can be out in the world earning.  It's just economics.</comment>

<comment>Of course it is a societal demand?  You just said it was not in their case!</comment>

<comment>I mean "of course it is an applicable example."  The economically smart choice is to invest in the career of the individual with a much higher salary.  Splitting things 50/50 does not always make sense.  That's all I'm saying.</comment>

<comment>And once again it has nothing to do with the point of the article that women are expected to provide free labor, not that it is necessarily their choiceYou however give an example were the husband is a writer (!) a profession that can be done from home and does not require you to leave the house chooses (!) to take on the traditional female role because his wife has a good paying job that does require her to leave the house.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  It's a great illustration of where a 50/50 split makes no sense, and wouldn't be any different if their genders were reversed.</comment>

<comment>Woosh over your head</comment>

<comment>Who are you to tell other people what to do? Conservatives don't actually believe in individual freedom unless it means their own freedom to impose their cultural norms to the rest of America (i.e. wife at home, husband at work, no abortion and minimal sex education), this is the truth. Women's freedom took decades to grow, is fot even complete yet, why do you think you have an input. The right cries that the rest of the country don't like their moral intervention, yet they want to impose their values on other people, especially when it comes to deny reproductive control and impose gender stereotypes. #hugehypocrisyculture</comment>

<comment>These days, it is more likely to be the college educated and better employed female. ;)</comment>

<comment>YES! Its just that too often at the end of the day, when mom's paid work is done, then housework begins too- bathing children, making lunch for the next day, washing clothes, dishes... Whereas for men its going to a pick up game of basketball or watching the game or being online. This is what the article is discussing.</comment>

<comment>If you think that raising small children isn't work, you haven't done it.  I was delighted to get a job. And then 100 per cent of my income went to the household, whereas my husband gave  a smaller percentage of his, keeping the rest for himself.  Then when I was the only person working, he still didn't contribute to the household chores except on Saturday morning. So I was supporting the family and still doing all the extra work.</comment>

<comment>Where did I say that?</comment>

<comment>But everyone knows their jobs, right?  Your situation sounds a little like chaos to me.  I'm a woman.  I do the woman stuff, and I'm fine with it.  My husband does the guy stuff.  We don't obsess about percentage of workload per person.</comment>

<comment>I'm of two minds about this.  I very much think we should all be doing 'our stuff'.  I don't mind mind doing dishes, but my wife hates it, so I do 80% of the dishes.That said, I think the 'men's work' and 'womens' work' is valuable shorthand in society, so long as we don't take it too seriously.</comment>

<comment>Then what happens when you all get older and chances are he dies first? Your benefits are a fraction of his which immediately places you in poverty.Or what if your marriage doesn't make it? Then again you are at a huge financial disadvantage that you will never overcome.My point is: women or men who stay home to run things deserve financial consideration as their work saves society as a whole billions of dollars a year.</comment>

<comment>The problem is calling it "woman" stuff and "guy" stuff. The day every couple, no matter the gender of each member, will be able to share chores according to their respective workload outside, taking into account their respective skills (yes, a woman can use a drill and push a lawnmower), I'm fine with it.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that part of their genome that makes women love doing laundry and washing dishes. Everyone knows about that.It's pretty simple. You need to eat and wear clean clothes, you help make that happen.</comment>

<comment>Personally I hate, absolutely hate doing house work. However I will gladly muck out stables, feed the life stock, mow the yard all day long. Clearly my gnome is defective. Not withstanding this I still do most of the washing and laundry</comment>

<comment>"women love doing laundry and washing dishes" *scoff scoff scoff* Black people were supposed to like being taken in charge when they were slaves, they were even supposed to be happy to serve their masters.Laundry and dishwashing are chores. Now anyone of any gender can take a particular liking in an housework activity, but it is usually not the case; otherwise, they wouldn't be called "chores".Now I don't know your ethnic background, but if you are of African descent, think before lashing back at me: if you don't like being shoved stereotypes in the face, even those from the past, don't shoot stereotypes yourself.</comment>

<comment>Situation for women/girls in developing countries will improve only with improvement in economic conditions.</comment>

<comment>women should do their women's work and let the men do the men's work.men are not your personal servants, ladies.</comment>

<comment>So The Gates want government to regulate the distribution of household chores?</comment>

<comment>Note that in most countries, women sleep longer than men.If women are both sleeping more than men, and also doing more chores than men, something has to give, time-wise. That thing is employment. Personally, I'd much rather be hanging out at home with a beloved child I grew inside my body, or in the air-conditioning loading clothes into a washing machine (barely a chore nowadays) than slaving away in an office after a stressful commute. Staying at home with the kids is the good part of the deal, trust me.</comment>

<comment>"or in the air-conditioning loading clothes into a washing machine "I think that that is not really the situation of most people that the Gates foundation is working with.</comment>

<comment>Then we shouldn't really offer solutions to America, then, should we?</comment>

<comment>Not for everyone. The reason why so many women wanted to enter the working market is to have financial autonomy and to get a fulfillment somewhere else than in cooking and cleaning.</comment>

<comment>"trust me" -- you're talking to a lot of women here who have done both. If you haven't been home with the kids for a time in your life, *and* gone to work every day at a different time in your life, then you should be listening to the women here, not telling us to trust you. WE are the ones who know what it's like, for the most part. And we know what it's like to work full-time and still be the primary parent and homemaker. Trust us.</comment>

<comment>You really consider being away from the rest of your family all day while they bond and grow together a satisfying lifestyle? My mind is genuinely boggled. Perhaps you shouldn't have had children if you consider them so onerous to you and your career aspirations.</comment>

<comment>Do you have children?If so how are you planning to support them?If you are counting on your spouse are you aware that 50% of marriages end in divorce?Are you aware that many ex spouse do not pay child support or only make partial payments?</comment>

<comment>50% of marriages end in divorce but this counts trailer trash and Britney Spears weddings. Marriages between educated and well-to-do couples have a much lower divorce rate. Same goes for reneging on child support.</comment>

<comment>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pm... see appendix 2 Many non custodial parents  simply not pay support, or don't pay all of it. In several extreme cases a non-custodial parent went years without making payments. Parents (the majority men) can and do walk away, and never suffer a day for ithttp://www.irp.wisc.edu/resear...  he studies (Yoonsook Ha, Maria Cancian, Daniel R. Meyer, and Eunhee Han, 2008) About half of non-custodial parents do not pay the full sum they owe. We're not talking about just a handful of people who don't get caught, we're talking about half.</comment>

<comment>Um, no it isn't.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry that you value the joys of raising children so lowly. Greenbacks won't ever fill the hole in your heart, buddy.</comment>

<comment>Nice, when you have no answers resort to the personal attack.Sure she must be a bad mother for not staying at home.Clearly according to your lamentations you are working and away from home all the time, with your "reasoning" that makes you a horrible father </comment>

<comment>" paulrusss  9 hours ago Clearly you have never been to the grocery store at 11pm to buy your pregnant wife ice cream and pickles."So basically you just tell whatever lie suits your sob story</comment>

<comment>http://qz.com/411701/worldwide...Maybe you should read why that is!The study clearly pinpoints that since women do more multitasking  (and lets not forget most of the unpaid labor after their paid work day) Why do you think women should also sleep less? It is perfectly logical that women would be more fatigued after having to do double the unpaid labor men do on top of a full workday.As for your "women don't have jobs and just hang out at home" that is just ridiculous, maybe in the 70ths you could make that claim but nowadays most women work outside of the house</comment>

<comment>Statistically men work more hours than women, so you can't automatically assume that women do double the unpaid labor as men after also working 8-10 hours a day at a paid job, like many men do.</comment>

<comment>Sure Studies and stats do not matter, reality and fact do not matter only those that confirms your personal assertions can be used</comment>

<comment>What?  In most countries women are up long before the men getting things ready for the household! First world countries have advantages that you think are universal. And you haven't taken care of a child for more than an hour or two, or you would find that getting any work done with a toddler in the house is actually very difficult.</comment>

<comment>Not according to the chart.</comment>

<comment>No, this is about changing attitudes and behavior.That should be obvious to anyone with a modicum of intelligence.How sad that such an intellectually vacuous comment should prove so popular.</comment>

<comment>And how do you changes attitudes and behavior without changing public policy?</comment>

<comment>The same way attitudes and behavior were changed about things like drunk driving and smoking. Was there a policy component to the reduction in those behaviors? Yes, but except for few minor tweaks around the edges of existing law (like increasing the penalties for drunk driving) it was overwhelmingly about raising awareness of the issues.</comment>

<comment>No, it was about punishing drunk driving as a crime. So, yeah, a major policy change in the form of laws and punishment.</comment>

<comment>No, it wasn't a major policy change. DUI has been against the law forever, and as someone who was arrested and punished for it more than 40 years ago (long before MADD was ever a thing),  I can say with certainty it was considered a crime.  Penalties have rightly increased for it, but that's hardly a major policy change.</comment>

<comment>That people are now doing years in dangerous, filthy prisons for an offense that years ago was similar to a speeding ticket is, in fact, a major policy change. I would prefer to not be legally threatened if I choose to let my wife, who does not work, clean up after the kids, when I come home after an 8-10 hour day. </comment>

<comment>Does this study account for the fact that often men are the primary breadwinner?  Obviously if one partner is working 8 hours a day and the other isn't, they shouldn't be doing the same amount of chores.  Technically all the work a stay at home mom does is unpaid, but that's not really in the same category as chores that the woman ends up doing in a dual-income couple.There's also the aspect of who decides that something needs doing and whether that makes them assume responsibility for it.  I know when I was growing up, if left in the hands of my dad the house would have been vacuumed much less often, not because he was lazy but just because he didn't see a need to have a spotless floor in a house with 3 kids running around.</comment>

<comment>What if both parents are out of the house working 8 hours a day? In those instances the household chores still fall primarily on the woman even though she too is out of the house working 8 hours a day. </comment>

<comment>Maybe, maybe not.  This article just presents overall statistics on how much unpaid work each gender does without weighing by how much paid work each gender does.  The fact that societies where woman are less likely to work have a higher ratio of unpaid work in these statistics certainly supports that it's more of a stay-at-home mother effect at work.</comment>

<comment>You are right. Further, the amount of time spent in household activities is not necessarily exactly the same as the amount of work actually done, is it? The point is overall valid, but the statistics is badly presented.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, I guess. Anecdotally, I have never known anyone with a stay at home mom or who has the option to be a stay at home mom. In most cases it seems like both parents in two parent homes are required to work, but the house chores usually fall primarily on the women.</comment>

<comment>In my family both parents worked. The chores fell on the children ;) Annoying at the time but made us all self-sufficient adults capable of running our own houses</comment>

<comment>Yes, that was how it was in my family as well. But there are some chores that children cannot do until they reach a certain age. I might trust a 5 year old to make their own bed. But I wouldn't expect them to cook or mow the lawn or do anything that they are just not physically capable of handling yet.</comment>

<comment>At which point I trust that two adults who love each other can figure out a division of labor that works for their time schedules. It was rather easy for my parents I imagine - both my parents traveled frequently for work. Naturally, the parent who was not traveling at the time did ALL the work!</comment>

<comment>That's unusual. Children usually have to pick up their rooms and shovel the driveway, but families where the kids were expected to cook dinner and do laundry are pretty rare. Not to mention all the other "household management" stuff that usually falls to women. Like paying bills and waiting for the plumber to show, and driving kids to piano lessons and planning birthday parties and remembering social engagements . . .</comment>

<comment>I believe it is unfortunate that simple household chores given to children is rare today. A five year old can pick up laundry and help sort it, and even help fold it after it is done. A seven year old can dust, pick up the papers and help clean off the kitchen table. All the little, time-consuming tasks that the parent does could be delegated out to the child in an age-appropriate way, so that when the adult-only tasks arrive, such as driving or waiting for the plumber, the adult isn't so worn out.</comment>

<comment>In my experience, helping small children learn to do simple chores, monitoring how the work is done, rewarding the results, is much more time-consuming than doing it yourself. Teaching children is good education for the children, and if you're longsighted as well as optimistic you'll hope that time spent teaching a five-year-old will result in a fifteen-year-old whose willing help is truly helpful. But if you're drowning in the stress of life with a job and a houseful of preschoolers, you'll just do it now, because it's easier now.</comment>

<comment>Very good point; thank you.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps it is unusual, it certainly wasnt the case for my friends whose parents had nannies or domestic workers, but those of us who didnt it was pretty usual to have afternoon chores, and even if you werent cooking they prepped (got the stuff out and ready, maybe boiled water and peeled veggies), and those of my friends from lower class whose parents worked double shifts or who didnt have a parent were often more responsible than the adults in their lives. As for the second part? I dont recognize any of those last ones you mentioned as stereotypically female or "usually woman's" work at all... I think our society sort of associates cooking, cleaning, laundry with that. Most married couples I know split the bill paying (someone does cellular, internet, someone else utilities, etc) and the rest depend on schedules. If you are a stay-at-home parent or someone who works from home I can see how you would wait for the plumber or whatever but that would just logically fall on whoever is home. My neighbor is psychiatrist and he sees patients at his home, for example, so naturally that stuff falls on him. And remembering social engagements? Really?</comment>

<comment>My mother did quite a bit for my father over the years but she quit working when I was born. Other than a stint in local politics she never worked for a salary. My wife briefly worked minimum wage jobs when I lost mine, but for 8 of the last ten years stated home with the kids. I pay all of our bills, do most chores that require strength or mechanical abilities, and will occasionally clean if the house gets too out of control. But since I'm paying for whatever she needs, I feel that she could do much of the child care and housekeeping. </comment>

<comment>That is all fine and dandy if she is a stay at home mom. There is no excuse for a housewife to shirk household chores. The issue arises when both parents work fulltime but the husband slacks on all the chores. </comment>

<comment>I think the differences in free time may be more the issue.  If both spouses work outside the home - or there are small children in the home needing care - it will not seem fair if one spouse is channel surfing every night while the other is cleaning.</comment>

<comment>I agree. If she did work full time I would have to do quite a bit more. I don't think though that a few loads of laundry and dropping off the kids at school, then picking them up, should take 8 hours. </comment>

<comment>You might ask your wife to track what she does for a week - my suspicion is that you do not realize all the things she does and how much time they take.  Routine cleaning - especially when there are children in the house can take more time than you realize.  Also cooking, ferrying children to activities, helping with homework etc.  You seem to think you are getting a raw deal, but research has shown that most people overestimate the time it takes to do the chores they do and underestimate the time it takes to do the chores their spouse does.  Perhaps, if you both tracked your time for a week or two, you would have a more accurate picture.</comment>

<comment>Most women absolutely do work outside the home in the above examples. The stay-at-home mom job is a thing of the past, from the US to developing countries.</comment>

<comment>It also matters how much she is making per hour (opportunity cost)</comment>

<comment>Why should her salary matter? If both partners are  working outside of the home for equal amounts of time, then they should share the responsibilities of maintaining the home/family equally. </comment>

<comment>absolutely not, having a $500 per hour executive doing a minimum wage job instead of someone who could only make $20 per hour outside the home makes a big difference.  The opportunity cost for each is vastly difference and explains a lot.</comment>

<comment>The person pulling the bulk of the income needed to keep the home with the lights on and the water running is doing the responsibility for maintaining the home and family.</comment>

<comment>But when you have two people bringing in income, which later gets pooled together for living expenses and they spend equal amounts of time outside of the home it really doesn't matter who makes more. Just because a husband is pulling in a larger salary at his job doesn't mean he is actually doing "more work" or even harder work. So aside from making sure bills are paid and the lawn is mowed once a week the man usually contributes minimum effort to running the house and raising  the children.</comment>

<comment>If a two income family's combined income is $100k, but one of them makes 80 and the other makes 20, it absolutely contributes a huge amount to the running the house because without that the house doesn't exist.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't matter. For all you know, the person who makes $80k is sitting in their office doing nothing while their admin does all of their work for them while the person who is making $20k is on their feet all day running around doing actual physical labor. Why should the person who makes $80k be off the hook for doing household chores while the person who did actual physical work is forced to do the household chores because in your eyes they are less valuable?</comment>

<comment>If you're actually espousing the LTV then, you're right, there is no way their labor can be equally as valuable if one of them is doing some boring white collar work and the other is digging holes and then filling them in.  The latter will perform far more labor.</comment>

<comment>Every situation for every family is different. No chore should be delegated to someone simply because it is either "man's" or "woman's" work. What is wrong with the idea of doing something because regardless of who does it, it is simply something that needs to be done?</comment>

<comment>Who makes the most money isn't the critical issue here. The limiting factor is time. If two people work 40 hours then they both have equal amounts of time to put into their household. if they don't want to invest the time, maybe they shouldn't have a family.</comment>

<comment>It can be very important.Let's say you are a stay at home spouse with a Law degree who can earn 500,000 outside the home.  The family is sacrificing that income in order to get manual labor that could be bought for $10 per hour.  On paper, this may seem like an insane trade off but makes perfect sense if the spouse is getting something of value in return.</comment>

<comment>"Opportunity cost" is the money lost if I do this, rather than that. If both partners have optional work hours, so that each can choose to work longer or shorter time and have pay adjusted accordingly, then comparison of hourly earnings would impact opportunity cost. Otherwise, not.</comment>

<comment>it matters a lot if you are setting priorities,deciding to stay at home, hiring staff to do chores or daycare, work overtime (paid or not), deciding about commutes and a whole lot more.</comment>

<comment>The "unpaid labor gap" persists even in two-income families.</comment>

<comment>'Two-income' is not nearly specific enough to matter.</comment>

<comment>As does the paid labor gap.The paid labor gap is larger and men work more altogether than women when paid and unpaid are summed.</comment>

<comment>However, if he earns more and ends up paying a greater share of the home expenses, then she is effectively getting paid via room and board.  I have seen articles that claim women control 80% of consumer spending, and that is what you would conclude with a stroll through a shopping mall.  Of course, many big purchase decisions are made jointly, so I don't know how reliable these estimates can be.  I think most real estate agents would say that women have a bigger impact on which house is purchased, though men have more say in the general area.</comment>

<comment>Time Use Study data from the census from 2003-2009 and a 2007 Pew research study answered that question. Men perform on average an extra half hour of work per week. They tend to work longer hours than their partners and work at home tends to be outside of the home. But, when you stop watch it all, it is what it is, women aren't the victims they like to portray themselves all the time.</comment>

<comment>Outdated source material with no link to back it up is not something to be accepted at face value.It sounds like you want to portray men as blameless victims.</comment>

<comment>http://www.usatoday.com/story/...No, I want to point out anecdotal evidence being presented as facts. Same thing with Domestic Violence. Two women's studies professors did a single survey and the results from which are quoted all over the place. Ignore the fact that leading researchers who only focus on violence pointed out leading questions and omissions in their survey.If you look at v75 of the Journal of Aggression and Maltreatment which tabulates over 200 different independent studies, you will find some startling information.Just like you do with division of labor studies. It is what it is, we can all find data to back up whatever we want. Until you see the data, the questions, the statistical deviations, etc.</comment>

<comment>Ok, so women spend more time in childcare. But what happens when they are grown? Don't the tables shift enormously? Also, if you read the second study quoated (the actual study) they counted women driving children to / from obligations as unpaid work but didn't add commute time for men (I guess that is just considered fun time for them) where I would argue doorstep to doorstep as time obligated towards the family unit.I have to read the one mentioned in the first article, it is new to me.</comment>

<comment>You have yet to make any sort of relevant point that counters the argument that women (who work fulltime) are actually doing more work than men. You quoted an out of date study.</comment>

<comment>I did, you chose not to read it. You send me two articles, one which has already been showed that the study was flawed, e.g. men get no credit for commute time yet women do when commuting children to obligations.We can throw statistics around all day long. Rather than read an interpretation of them through the bias of an online writer, go to the actual studies and read them. Then lets debate.</comment>

<comment>No thanks. You are not a very worthy opponent. We can throw facts and studies at each other all day long proving anything we want. </comment>

<comment>Bringing up the children being grown proves nothing. If the husband and wife are still married and working don't they need to prepare food? Clean the house? Have clean clothes? Etc. Do those things just stop being necessary once children grow up?Now that the kids are grown and out of the house the husband suddenly starts putting in equal effort to tending to the home? Not bloody likely.</comment>

<comment>It seems like you are trying to reverse the information.http://www.weforum.org/agenda/...</comment>

<comment>Equality means that both people do the same amount of parenting and housework, regardless of employment.</comment>

<comment>That is a strange definition of equality.  If one person works an 8 hour day, one person doesn't work, and there are 4 hours of chores to do, dividing them evenly means one person is doing more than twice as much work overall.</comment>

<comment>Because it's not one.  I was being sarcastic.</comment>

<comment>Ah, carry on then.</comment>

<comment>That is no longer true.</comment>

<comment>In the Middle East and South Asia, where the largest effects were found in the cited study, it certainly is.  In Europe and America (where it sited a fairly small effect), it is much less common than it once was but there are certainly still many more stay at home moms than stay at home dads.</comment>

<comment>Well, if chores were distributed equally, more women would have more time for their careers, meaning more money to contribute.As for your second comment, maybe too many women are neat freaks… but maybe too many men are slobs, too. That reasoning goes both ways.</comment>

<comment>If one parent gets paid for their work during a workday and the other doesn't, well, that's the way the system is right now. But it doesn't excuse the one who gets paid from pitching in equally *after* arriving home from work. The one who already gets the reward of income for doing work should not come home and act like that buys him/her out of doing an equal amount of work while home outside of job hours. (Then again, that's one reason some men stay at work so long every day. Some will admit this, some won't. It's not the only reason, but it often plays a role.)Working just as hard as your spouse, and getting NOTHING for it, is a slap in the face. For your partner to then disrespect you adds insult to injury. Don't make it worse still by acting entitled to leisure at home while your partner works all day and into the evening every day.</comment>

<comment>Getting nothing for it? Presumably they would get half of their paid spouse's income.</comment>

<comment>Not having to actually work and still having food, shelter and money are not nothing.  If both spouses are working the same amount, then yes, it's only fair they should share the household tasks equally as well.  If one spouse is working more than the other, or harder (and some jobs are harder than others), then it's equally fair that the harder working spouse shoulder fewer of the household responsibilities.  If one spouse chooses to stay home (and, these days, it is virtually always a choice) while the other spouse brings in 100% of the income, then it's only fair that  the stay-at-home spouse do the lions share of the housework, unless the couple agrees otherwise.And, by the way, while maybe a few decades (or longer) ago, keeping a house was a full-time job, it hasn't been that way in a very long time. There are single people all over the place who work full time jobs (or more) and manage to do just fine.  Parents, even.</comment>

<comment>That was the point of the first paragraph in the study:"..Greater gender equality in working hours is not just about more women in full-time employment. It is also about more men reducing their long hours in paid work. Although detailed information is available for a limited number of OECD countries, data on the usual hours worked per week illustrate how the prevalence of long and short working hours differs across countries and the sexes..."Men also have more leisure time despite working long hours.</comment>

<comment>"Does this study account for the fact that often men are the primary breadwinner?"40 % of US women are the sole or primary breadwinners.maybe if women weren't presumed the primary care giver of children and be expected to do the majority of household unpaid work, we'd see more parity in bread-winning?i think that's the point of the article. gendered expectations on men and women to assume certain roles is whats leading to this gap in both work and home. are we not capable of being a bit more aware of these things and have more egalitarian relationships? clearly a lot has already changed over the years in first world countries.families already look a lot different then they used to look(it was only 11% female breadwinners in the 60s)clearly we're capable of changing and adapting. I'm not buying that women are just somehow more predisposition to vacuuming then men. we could've been making a lot more generalized assumptions like these about genders just 60 years ago. maybe fathers are less accustomed to doing house chore than mothers? perhaps that doesn't necessarily have to stay the same and we can have a less of a gender divide here? i don't think that's too radical of an idea.</comment>

<comment>In the west, marriage for men means sacrificing much of their freedom, and nearly all of their property rights. We have no reproductive rights whatsoever, and very limited parental rights. Feminist and leftist policies ensure that marriage can be an enormous legal quagmire. While a divorced woman can often expect a handsome financial settlement, men can expect decades of slavery, with jail terms looming for the dastardly crime of unemployment. It may surprise most women to learn that most men would prefer to not surrender their freedom and their money to a rapidly obesifying, sexless grouch. We should have men do housework, too, in addition to surrendering money, freedom, and regular sex? Small wonder marriage rates are plummeting. </comment>

<comment>damn right! I'd rather be alone than have to do all the chores on behalf of the man AND myself.</comment>

<comment>You are a stupid person.</comment>

<comment>As an attorney it was surprising to me that more men want marriage than women did. Most divorces I handled were when the women got fed up with the lack of help from the man.</comment>

<comment>That is understood.For women, divorce has upsides, and for men, downsides (they were mentioned in the comment you replied to).Are you really an attorney without an understanding of incentives?Get divorced, get child support / alimony and your ex husband is now your slave.  You still get his income but provide him nothing in return.Do you really not understand why that dynamic would encourage women to divorce and make men think twice about it?Involuntary servitude is illegal, unless in instances of divorce.</comment>

<comment>What state do you live in?Child support is not slavery--everyone has to pay for kids, they don't eat for free and they do have bedrooms, clothes, etc.Alimony on the other hand is being phased out for all but the oldest homemakers in my state.</comment>

<comment>https://www.washingtonpost.com...Child support is often set at an amount far higher than the father can pay.When he cannot pay, he is sent to jail.Seriously, it is a thing.Do you not know any poor people or something?  Many have so much child support they end up homeless, so that they can put their baby momma in a home she doesn't have to pay for.Besides, if married and he was unable to provide for his children, he wouldn't go to jail.If unmarried and he was unable to provide for his children, he goes to jail.Let us compare this to the treatment of poor women with children:If married and she was unable to provide for her children, she wouldn't go to jail.If unmarried and she was unable to provide for her children, she gets a check from her baby daddy and likely the state.Women get checks, men get cells.  Tell me that is equality under the law.This is often why organizations such as NOW opposed shared parenting.  Mothers would have to start working if they did not by default get full custody and the check it entails.This is the problem, it is a state by state fix, and some states are more willing to confront this misandry than others.</comment>

<comment>In divorce the men have far more upsides than downsides.Within one year their income increases by about 24% while a woman's decreases by over 60%. Child support covers a fraction of the true cost of rearing a child.Yes I worked as an attorney but after my second marriage I became a stay at home parent and channeled my energy into becoming a juried artist</comment>

<comment>So by virtue of getting a divorce, they get a pay bump commensurate with 3 promotions?Citation is needed, because you are wrong.Maybe men work 25% more hours so that they can have a roof over their head while providing for their children who are no longer under their roof.Calling that a 25% pay increase seems to be... dishonest.</comment>

<comment>No. Because he is no longer married and no longer having to support her and basic support for the children his expenses go way down. If they stayed married more of his income would be going into the children and household things.</comment>

<comment>Do you understand what income is?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...You are using the term incorrectly.You are doing this either through ignorance or a failed attempt to deceive to me.Please stop either lying or ignorantly talking about things you do not understand.This is only true for upper middle class people with 1 income.In middle class and lower situations, both parties have decreased incomes.  This is true on paper anyway, many women supplement this income from their former spouse with a live in boyfriend.Stop hurting the poor with your poor understanding of their situation.  If you still want to insist what you claim is true, I demand you cite anything that supports your inane assertion.</comment>

<comment>I highly highly doubt this. In NYS, 12.5% of your income per child automatically goes to Mom. Amounts can be higher but are never lower. Child support can be tens of thousands of dollars. It often goes to support grown women, as well, not children. I know several divorced men. None of them experienced a better lifestyle after divorce. Most divorced men lay large sums of money to women after they divorce. I also know of very few men who actively seek out marriage. And over 70% of divorces are initiated by women. This is not because they wish to be impoverished. </comment>

<comment>"And over 70% of divorces are initiated by women."gee i wonder why..."First, confounding the view of marriage as the female heaven and haven is the fact that marriage actually appears to benefit men more than it does women (link is external). Research has shown that the "marriage benefits"—the increases in health (link is external), wealth (link is external), and happiness (link is external) that are often associated with the status—go disproportionately to men. Married men are better off than single men. Married women, on the other hand, are not better off than unmarried women.""The results revealed an intriguing pattern: As expected, women initiated roughly two thirds (69%) of the breakups in heterosexual marriages. However, the gendered trend in relationship breakups held only for marriages and not for other non-marital unions. Moreover, women in marriages, but not in other relationships, reported lower levels of satisfaction. "https://www.psychologytoday.co...</comment>

<comment>"For women, divorce has upsides, and for men, downsides (they were mentioned in the comment you replied to)."really?"Divorce makes men - and particularly fathers - significantly richer. When a father separates from the mother of his children, according to new research, his available income increases by around one third. Women, in contrast, suffer severe financial penalties. Regardless of whether she has children, the average woman's income falls by more than a fifth and remains low for many years.""Jenkins combined data from 14 different British Household Panel Surveys over 1991 to 2004 with the findings from five European surveys. Recalculating the results using the formula by which the government measures poverty, he established new per capita incomes. Jenkins found that the positive effect on men's finances is so significant that divorce can even lift them out of poverty, while women are far more likely to be plunged into destitution. Separated women have a poverty rate of 27% - almost three times that of their former husbands. "http://www.theguardian.com/lif..."Women and children are hit hardest following the breakdown of a relationship, with research showing that one in five mothers falls into poverty following a split.Comprehensive analysis of how parents fare in the years after separation found that children and their mothers see living standards fall by more on average during the aftermath than fathers. Researchers also found that, after couples with grown-up children separated, almost a third of women, usually over 50 and often married, fell into relative poverty, a far higher proportion than for men.The study, by the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, found that 19% of children fall into relative poverty after their parents split up. Mike Brewer, professor of economics at the university, who conducted the study along with Dr Alita Nandi, said: "Women continue to see living standards fall by more after separation than men, especially when children are involved, but even for couples with no children. Mothers and children from high-income families see especially large drops in living standards, because the loss of the man's earnings is in no way compensated for by higher income from alimony, child maintenance, benefits and tax credits, and having fewer mouths to feed."

<comment>Here in the west, women have all kinds of labor saving devices that free them from a lot of household chores. No longer do they have to haul water, we have indoor plumbing that makes water available at the turn of a tap. No longer do they have to chop wood, we have natural gas, electricity, and central heating that make energy and heat available at the flick of a switch.When women do laundry here, they just put a load of clothes in a washing machine along with some detergent and start it running, then they can go and relax and enjoy some leisure time while the machine does the work. When it is done, they just transfer the wet laundry to a drying machine and start it running and return to their leisure activity again while it does the work of drying the laundry. When it is done, they just fold the laundry and put it away. Total human labor time, fifteen minutes tops.When women wash dishes, we have dishwashing machines. They just place the dishes in it, put in some detergent, and start the machine and then go back to their leisure activities while it does the work. When it is done, they just put the dishes away in the cupboards. Again, total human labor time, fifteen minutes tops.These labor saving machines have become so reliable and cheap that the overwhelming majority of people I know have them and use them every day. The trouble has become that women are doing so LITTLE household chore labor in the west now that the real problem is they are suffering from an obesity epidemic from all the leisure time they have that they are engaging in too LITTLE physical activity. Yet feminists keep trying to sell the naive and gullible on the idea that women in the west are worked to death with household chores so much that men should do their chores for them, and they use the chores that women in the undeveloped non-western countries have to perform as examples to try and make their case. Don't be so naive and gullible and you won't fall for such obvious feminist propaganda. LOL.</comment>

<comment>haha if these machines are so easy and quick to use, how come men aren't jumping all over these chores. oh, right, its still "women's work" beneath you because doing the laundry would presumably kill your manly manliness.</comment>

<comment>Actually I do laundry, wash dishes, etc. That's how I know how much labor it really takes to do these chores.</comment>

<comment>yes, there is obviously always an exception, as evidenced by the graphic showing men do participate a bit but overall still not enough.</comment>

<comment>You know that a large percentage of the population is single.The times I have not been single we have still kept seperate apartments which gives me a good understanding of what is required to maintain a house and do all needed household chores.If I want to keep it spotless I might do 20 hours a week, while if I I just do what is needed and do not have visitors its less than 10.</comment>

<comment>Studies indicate it can also kill your sex life, which is infrequent enough in most marriages. Women do not offer sex more to husbands who do dishes, sweeping, laundry, and mopping. They offer it less. </comment>

<comment>I read that article too...i think the reason for it is that currently the guys who do the chores are maybe already kinda lame to start with...hence the lack of sex.  If it was just an unspoken thing, where no one talks about doing the chores and they are just done, the sex thing would fall away.</comment>

<comment>I think you're misreading the facts (admittedly the data above is vague and not very helpful) in your zeal to find an "Evil Feminist" theme. The idea that feminists want women to get men to do all their chores is a fantasy. It's all about equity, choice, balance, fairness.</comment>

<comment>I'm curious if they count time time spent sitting watching tv waiting for these devices to run as "work".Time spent waiting is not work, but likely counted that way.</comment>

<comment>Do you count time spent waiting for your boss to make a decision as work? Of course you do. Even sitting in a meeting doodling on a notepad is counted. So time spent "waiting" can be counted as work. When I'm doing the laundry, I can't be running errands. If the woman is running a few loads of laundry during her TV show, can't a man do the same during his show?</comment>

<comment>Except I don't have freedom at work to do as I please.Unless you have to hold your dryer closed, you lie.</comment>

<comment>The entire point of the machines is to let you do other things while they run.  I do errands all the time when I do laundry. I put a load in right before I leave, do errands for an hour or two, come home and put them in the dryer.  Works just fine. I do the dishes by hand immediately after I finish eating. That takes about 10 minutes.</comment>

<comment>"Here in the west, women have all kinds of labor saving devices that free them from a lot of household chores."That statement alone shows you expect household work to fall on the woman. This is misogyny in action.</comment>

<comment>I agree that the time and effort spent using a microwave, dishwasher, and electric washer & dryer is MUCH less time and effort than my grandmother, who used a gas oven, a wringer washer, and hung her clothes outside to dry. I don't think the article states that men should "do their [the women's] chores for them" as you state. Perhaps both the husband and wife should rejoice that the cooking and cleaning today takes less time than ever, and if they both jumped in to take care of these chores together, they could have even more leisure time with each other and their children.</comment>

<comment>I don't know how many times I've had to tell you on housework articles over the past three years of commenting that women may not actually be engaged in leisure activities while cycling the laundry through (and it's longer than fifteen minutes to fold a basket and put it away).  They may be doing other labor and watching the clock so that laundry gets done efficiently.  They may be doing any number of other chores, inside or outside the house, with their husband or without.  You refuse to learn.</comment>

<comment>The misogynistic comments already flowing under this article is disheartening.</comment>

<comment>It being a misandrous article, that's a natural response.</comment>

<comment>Ah, didn't think that MRA nonsense word got thrown around even at the Atlantic but apparently that's the case.</comment>

<comment>Seriously, according to feminism, this article is sexist against women.It paints them as damsels in distress waiting for men to release them from their labors.Do you call this article misogynistic?Why do you support the sexist damsel in distress narrative?</comment>

<comment>Seriously! I shudder to think about the personal situations that result in such an immediate outpouring of bitterness, rancor, b*tching, defensiveness -- any time an article on gender politics appears. Reminds me of my parents (shudder)!</comment>

<comment>In case nobody has noticed yet, that graphic appears to be terribly out of sorts.  Unless I'm completely misunderstanding the way it is intended to show relationships between the numerical values, in which case, it deserves a thorough explanation, not a mere deposition in the middle of prose.Example:  Look at the Canada and US portions under the Routine Housework column.

The graphics are wildly different.Please fix the graphic or remove it.Edited to clarify: The graphic labeled Minutes Per Day Spent on Unpaid Work and Leisure</comment>

<comment>If housework is unpaid labor explain how divorce court worksBecause according to the court both people in a marriage share the moneyThat's what marriage is</comment>

<comment>Your logic is off. Unpaid labor means the (usually) woman is not able to earn real income because her time is being eaten up with unpaid chores.</comment>

<comment>There's no such thing as unpaid chores. It's called being an adult with adult responsibilities. Do single women need to get paid for cooking and cleaning?And where do you stop? Is brushing your teeth an unpaid chore? Is reading to your kids?</comment>

<comment>I'm just waiting for the first time a judge orders a woman to vacuum her ex's living room for that month's alimony.</comment>

<comment>it's interesting,  the implication that women are not choosing to do this,  that they are somehow forced to do it.</comment>

<comment>They are by society's expectations. I remember when I married my first spouse. Both of us worked, me as a young attorney putting in over 100 hours a week and my spouse as an executive working about 65 a week. It was expected that I write every single thank you note for our wedding gifts, and basically keep up the apartment. It was society's expected norms</comment>

<comment>165 hours a week and couldn't afford $100 for a maid service.  Rough times.</comment>

<comment>We did have maid service but there still is tons to keep up</comment>

<comment>For a while, we took on a roommate whose sole contribution was 30 hours of housework a month.  Works out nice if you have the space =)Now that we've downsized, we've considered bringing someone in weekly, even though we make far less than you guys did.Maybe I should just spend less time on here :p</comment>

<comment>I think the best thing a couple can do for their marriage happiness is to hire the house cleaned on a regular basis, once a week, twice a month, or even once a month. It's worth sacrificing other things for because then the resentment doesn't build up</comment>

<comment>For us, we suffer pretty much equally, because most of our activities are done with each other.  For the most part, if one of us isn't having fun, no one is =)</comment>

<comment>Even if society expects you to write thank-you notes, society's expectations alone cannot force you to do anything.That is, unless the police showed up at your house and forced you to write thank-you notes.</comment>

<comment>Feminist agenda driven articles that make mountains out of molehills do women no favors-just bringin' more divisiveness with the men/women relationships. Like we are in a competition of the sexes all the time. How Ugly.When I was growing up, my siblings and I had to do a lot of the chores. Guess that's not a political pawn group. What about the male outdoor chores with lawn care, or repair/maintenance. Chores can actually be a time to reflect and think, listen to the news or music, chit chat with family. I don't mind them too much. Besides, I don't know about India, but most Western men who are decent people have the sense to help out without feminists telling them this. If they don't, we are perfectly capable of asking of such in a much kinder & sweeter way. Sweet talk works wonders with these silly issues. No need to be bitter! </comment>

<comment>.</comment>

<comment>This is my point - both my parents worked - so the kids did the lawn work, cooking, cleaning, taking care of dogs, etc etc. My parents...gardened and baked - two things they did on the weekends as hobbies, not chores.</comment>

<comment>Maybe if more kids were doing many of the chores, they would not feel so coddled and entitled when they enter college. I heard yesterday, some student activists at Harvard, or some college,  are now complaining their homework is interfering with their protesting time. </comment>

<comment>DISCLAIMER-I love women. I want them all to be educated, employed and as happy as they want to be.That said, how granular can you possibly be? Are we going to legislate housework?</comment>

<comment>Yes.The tentacles of the State must reach ever outwards.</comment>

<comment>I'll start pushing a vacuum as soon as my wife starts pushing a lawnmower.  Really, this article shouldn't conflate undeveloped countries with developed countries.  I do considerably less inside housework than my wife.  She does zero outside chores.  Which would you rather do--push a lawn mower and de-weed flower beds and trim trees in 92 degree heat, or push a vacuum in an air conditioned house?</comment>

<comment>Yup.  This winter I was the one in the snow shoveling the driveway and walk.  In a couple weeks I'm going to be giving a weekend to be up on a ladder mucking out the gutters.  Followed a couple months later by spending my Saturdays mowing an acre of lawn in the Carolina summer.  Also, I'm the one who has to deal with the occasional snake taking up residence in the garage or shed.  Sure, it's a chore I have to do only for a couple minutes every few months, but it's also the only chore in the household that involves deliberately risking being bitten by a timber rattler.  Thank God we don't live near wetlands because I refuse to deal with cottonmouths.</comment>

<comment>How many times a week, or even months, do you need to mower your lawn or de-weed an flower bed?Besides, many couples lives in homes (apartments, townhouses) for which that care is minimal or non-existent. But laundry and cooking never disappear.</comment>

<comment>In South Texas?  I need to mow the lawn every month, sometimes once a week.  If I do front and back yards and sweep up all the leaves, it takes 4 hours easily.  I also fix cabinet doors, toilets, take out the trash, install smoke alarms, install blinds, paint, change locks, hang lights in the garage, etc.Guess what?  Leaves and grass never disappear either.  And I do my own laundry and we share cooking.  So yeah, she can vacuum and clean toilets while I do all the outside work.  In fact, our yard gets mowed more frequently than the house gets swept and vacuumed.</comment>

<comment>What an Idiotic example.Having Bill Gates do dishes has an enormous opportunity cost.  Being generous, an hour of Bill Gates' time is worth 2000 times of Melinda's.  If someone in the family needs to do  the equivalent of a minimum wage job, it certainly should not be Bill.While the productivity differences between Bill and Melinda may be extreme, the same idea may help to explain the division of labor seen elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>The problem is not that women tend to do more chores and spend more time with children. The problem is that this work is not "valued", and that the only work that is valued is work that's earning money. In the US, we have built a system where the more money you make, the more society values you. It shouldn't be this way. It shouldn't be that we value the wall street financier who makes millions of dollars so much more highly than we do the social worker who is changing lives while making a meager wage. But that's the way it is</comment>

<comment>"The problem is that this work is not "valued", and that the only work that is valued is work that's earning money."No, the earning money is the only thing valued in regard to men. Society doesn't really value women that make money- they value women that are beautiful.Think about the popular magazines, TV shows, whatever. Society, at least American society, values men by the earning potential first and foremost and women by their attractiveness.It's not right- don't misunderstand me here, I'm not advocating. It's sad to the nth degree. But it is what it is.So glad I didn't have daughters, man. Stuff like this would eat me up as a parent.</comment>

<comment>This is something few have the courage to talk about. But it causes many dysfunctional dynamics within our workforce and society in general. And there are women that make other women suffer in the workplace if they happen to be attractive. But it's passive aggressive and cannot be 'proved'.... just makes life a living hell.</comment>

<comment>This is a side conversation about female worth in our society that's astray from the point I was making. But let me just say I'm sorry for you that this is your reality. I and my greater family appreciate my wife for being much more than a beautiful woman. She turned my life around, and making her as happy and satisfied as she can be is my life's mission. And the daughter we have together is the apple of her daddy's eye.</comment>

<comment>It has been my experience that those who do the unpaid work at the expense of a paid job outside the home, share equally in the proceeds of their spouse's paid work. And that is how it's valued. Rightly so.</comment>

<comment>Find me a culture where that isn't a case.</comment>

<comment>Japan. When the man gets home from work + after work karaoke & other office events, he hands what's left of his paycheck over to his wife, the master of the home and family... In theory.</comment>

<comment>Curious where this data comes from.  In my experience of basically middle class american families, the grunt work is always equally distributed. Sometimes it's segregated by location: woman inside cleaning etc, men in garage or outside mowing or fixing, trash etc.  Just each group doing what needs to be done.      In really dysfunctional couples I have seen an imbalance- usually a bum guy who eventually gets kicked out. But any functional couples I have seen- for half a century- share the burden, split their money evenly, make equal decisions, and gripe equally about it all.</comment>

<comment>Let's be honest. A lot of this work women do would simply not be done by men because we don't see it as worth the time. I can wear the same pair of pants a few days in a row.</comment>

<comment>I always wear a pair of pants a few days in a row. They last longer. The more wash cycles they go through the faster they wear out.</comment>

<comment>The answer is easy: it comes from surveys. It's certainly been the case in my experience that women tend to exaggerate the amount of housework they claim to do. Men, on the other hand, minimize it because it's considered unmanly.If the statistic went the other way, the authors would adjust for this. But as it confirms their bias they're happy to let it slide.</comment>

<comment>I think that at least in the US (or perhaps the cosmopolitan US), it's not a big deal. I'm 17. My dad does more housework than anyone. I'm next on the list. If we stopped doing the housework, things would pile up, since my mother and brother certainly don't see cleaning as worth their time. I won't exaggerate. I spend an hour or more a day doing housework. My dad spends up to three hours, even on weeknights when he's working 8-8. We understand that if we don't work, the house won't run.</comment>

<comment>So... do you see a connection between your claim that men see housework as "unmanly" and men not wanting do to housework?</comment>

<comment>Is it manly to keep the vacuum cleaner tuned up and at 'maximum suck?'Or pre-treating extra dirty spots on the laundry.....or sewing on buttons while watching football?</comment>

<comment>Seriously? I grew up with parents that actually are equitable with housework which is extremely unusual. Unless you count working on the car for a couple hours every once in awhile to be the same as grocery shopping, cooking and doing the dishes every single day.</comment>

<comment>In the house I grew up in, my mom spent about 3 hours per week doing laundry, an hour doing cleaning like vacuuming and dusting, and about an hour grocery shopping, and mom and dad took turns spending an hour each night cooking.  And the cleaning time overlapped with the laundry, so if you count them both as work you are actually counting the same time twice.So 5 hours of "unequal work" for my mother.  My dad in turn would spend at least 4 hours every Saturday or Sunday working on the yard mowing, trimming bushes, weeding the flower beds, etc.  And if anything on any of our vehicles broke my dad would fix it.  Many times it would take him 8-12 hours of labor or more to fix one of the cars (like when the head cracked on mom's SUV or when my sister's car bent a valve).Granted, the average man nowadays wouldn't be doing major engine repair to the point of stripping the engine block because they don't know how, but the point still stands that men do alot of work where there aren't any machines to do the labor for them, like laundry.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I do most of the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning, and handle most of child-related work. But my husband mows, pays the bills, changes the oil in the cars and often repairs them if needed, and fixes things around the house. And he works outside the home. I don't. I do get to volunteer at our church a lot, though, which I enjoy. It definitely works for us, and I don't consider what I do burdensome. I may not technically get paid for cooking dinner or planning a craft for a preschool church event, but what I do isn't worthless. Seriously, somebody has to do the unpaid work or families and volunteer organizations wouldn't function.</comment>

<comment>I pity you, poor victim of the hegemonic patriarchy, doomed to suffer under the oppressive yoke of the dominant male paradigm.  You probably wear bras as well and sit to use the bathroom.  Also safe space, retrograde feminism, gender inequality.  Did I get progressive bingo?</comment>

<comment>I find it fascinating that although ARC91681's comment says that their situation "definitely works" for them and is not "burdensome",  you felt the need to reply with bitterness, sarcasm, and resentment. It seems you saw something in the comment which simply wasn't there.</comment>

<comment>I find it fascinating that you can't tell I was mocking the supposed response of a bedwetting progressive that can't stand to see women in "traditional" roles.</comment>

<comment>The mocking was clear, but it seemed weird as a response to that particular comment. I guess i don't get the bitterness that permeates this thread.</comment>

<comment>Good for you if you choose it freely. But many women are imposed this scheme, sacrificing or downsizing their brilliant career in order to pick up after a husband who can pursue his. And of course, being judged if she still has a career while being a mother.</comment>

<comment>This doesn't make sense. Money is a means of exchange. Housework is not exchanged because the family directly benefits from 100% of the labor a woman puts in -- an advantage. When you exchange labor in the marketplace, you get a wage which is less than the commercial value of what you've produced (your employer gets the rest).The problem is when housework has less value than what a woman could earn doing more commercially valuable things, but this is totally different from being "unpaid."</comment>

<comment>To be fair, to some extent women are doing this unpaid work for themselves, and would have to be doing much of it even if they were single and living alone.</comment>

<comment>Yep. If the husband lived by himself, he might not be vacuuming at all, because he doesn't feel that it benefits him much. Why should the husband have to spend an equal amount of time on a chore that benefits his wife 100% but him not at all?</comment>

<comment>Housework is "unpaid" in the same way that building your own house is "unpaid."Unfortunately the Gate's don't get a cut in that transaction, like they do when you work in an office using their products.</comment>

<comment>You clearly missed the concept of opportunity cost in your Econ class. If women spend more  time on unpaid labor, they have less time to devote to more lucrative endeavors. EDIT: meant to post on your other comment v</comment>

<comment>That's exactly what I said in my other comment.To quote myself:The problem is when housework has less value than what a woman could earn doing more commercially valuable things, but this is totally different from being "unpaid."</comment>

<comment>What a bunch of horse hockey this study and report is. "Women work much harder than men in the home," according to some nit wits. Lets discuss some other things. How about that the husband is probably working a job, and maybe the wife too. So usually the burden of housework is shared. Then there is the lawn, usually mowed by the husband. Carpentry and repair projects are done usually by the husband. Gutters being cleaned out, the husband. Vehicle maintenance, the husband.So, there are dozens of jobs done around and in the house by the husband, for no pay, besides his 40 hour a week job. And if, just if, that couple lives rurally, the job load of the husband is increased several times. Jobs to do on weekends and holidays. This entire article is bullcrap. And really, as Melinda Gates is married to the most wealthy man in the world and does NOTHING around her home (I'll wager money on that) exactly why would anyone care what she believes?There is not a study ever made by man that can't have "a few holes shot through it" in one way or another. A "study" is merely an observation made by some schmoe in order to make a point about something they either believe in or are trying to disprove, so neither goal is without unanswered questions nor information contrary to the goal. Please spare the rest of society selfish and disputable goals and studies.</comment>

<comment>Men, generally, have lower standards, strongly so in regard to household cleanliness, but also in regard to childcare.  I suspect this is a matter of nature more than nurture.  The presumption here is that women' standards should rule, and that men should do more.  Maybe so:  It's undeniably true that women do more household work.  But part of the answer may simply be for women to do less.</comment>

<comment>This is cultural, not universal.  I'll concede the point for most Generation X American men, but have you ever dated a German dude?  Or my brother?  The world has its Felix Ungers, and not all of them live with other men.</comment>

<comment>Maybe women in the US are doing more household chores than men, but we won't know until it is being measured correctly.Say single men on average do 50 minutes of household chores and single women do 100 minutes. When they live together there is 60 minutes of chores based on what the guy is used to doing and 120 minutes based on what the woman is used to doing. The total work is more because more dishes and more clothes to wash, but the same amount of vacuuming, and mopping and still just one bathroom. From the guy's perspective an even split of housework is 30 minutes each. If she spends 90 minutes on housework to him she's spending 30 minutes on necessary work and 60 minutes because she seems to "enjoy" it. From her perspective he's a momma's boy who can't do anything for himself and who is perfectly happy to live in a pig-sty.The first step is getting the couple to agree on what is required. Then splitting it evenly. If you do not work out your household chores, like you work out your boundaries and safe word, he'll think it's what you do instead of playing video games or golf. Then when you're angry at him he's confused - after all you just spent an hour doing what you enjoy why are you so mad?</comment>

<comment>General cleaning goes up when more people are occupying the same space.  Running the vacuum cleaner may not take longer, but it may need to be done more often.  And there's twice as much stuff to pick up before you can run it.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that's what Caribis2 is saying.I think the point they're making is, let's say it takes me 10 minutes to competently clean the bathroom, but it takes the wife 15 minutes.If the end result is the bathroom is clean to the same relative standard, there's no accounting for the time differential in the above article and data.</comment>

<comment>I thought he was arguing about differing definitions of "competently clean the bathroom."  That standard may be different in shared space.  Everyone (including women) has a more relaxed attitude towards living in their own mess than in dealing with someone else's mess, so standards in close living situations may have to be a little higher than either partner would need if living alone.If nothing else, you  need to make sure that the other partner has some bathroom storage and a place to sleep and sit down.  My single-girl apartment frequently had only one kitchen chair without stuff on it.  That won't fly in shared quarters.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you could be right. It's kind of ambiguous.</comment>

<comment>So each weekday I wake up at 5:30 to get the kids ready for school, then go straight to work.  I get home at 6:00 and then watch the kids / clean etc. until 8:00.  After 8:00 I consider myself done for the day.My wife stays at home and probably spends about 10 hours a day on unpaid labor - me probably 3 hours.  Can some progressive people enlighten me on how to close this 7 hour gap?  I fell like I'm oppressing her (even though we have four kids, two under three, and I encouraged her to go back to work but she really wants to stay home).</comment>

<comment>Would your wife make more than you per hour?</comment>

<comment>No, we'd take a loss considering childcare expense, but I'd be happy to do it if it's what she wanted.  Oddly, she seems to value being home with the kids, which is NOT consistent with the article I just read.</comment>

<comment>then it seems that you are making the rational economic choice.  If she valued the time spent at home as zero, she would just be giving up the salary but instead she getting value out of her time. (nothing odd about that and needs to be counted as value)If you give up an hour of work time doing chores would your household be better off?</comment>

<comment>I suppose another question is who controls the finances.  Initially, I worked full time and took care of our children while my husband was in law school.  Once he was hired, I stayed home.  But our money has always been pooled and I'm in charge of the bills and budgeting.We consider ourselves a team.  The hours of work we both put in and the compensation we receive are shared.</comment>

<comment>>Oddly, she seems to value being home with the kidsYour wife is suffering a serious case of internalized misogyny.</comment>

<comment>By unpaid labor do you mean lounging about on the sofa eating bon bons and watching television?</comment>

<comment>If Bryan's wife has four children, two under the age of three, much of her work is actually childcare, which includes feeding, cleaning up after, and supervising the kids so that they don't kill themselves.  Older kids may require transportation to and from swim lessons, or school, if they're older.  The summer I was home alone with my two daughters while my husband was working out of state, I was up at 5:00 a.m. (because they wake up when it's light) and on my feet busy until 9:00 p.m.  And I only had two, ages 1 and a half and six.</comment>

<comment>Truthfully? Just help. Pick up after yourself and appreciate what she does by telling her every day. Just understand that because she stays home she is working just as hard or harder than you do and let her know that.My dad owned a large company and my mom stayed home with the four children. Even back then my dad made sure my mom was valued by paying her more (she was an officer in the company but never went in) than he did himself. He said that without her work he couldn't do what he did.It's not dividing the work evenly so to speak and if one parent stays home of course they will be doing more, it's making sure that unpaid person is valued and knows their valued.</comment>

<comment>You decided to have 4 kids and a stay at home wife....</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but I had 3 kids and a pretty large house and yard.  No way in hades it took 10 hour a day, every day to maintain all of that.  For example, when someone tells me they worked all day doing laundry that is crud.  You worked about 1 hour over a day long period getting laundry done, you did not work all day.  It simply does not take 10 hours of solid labor a day to manage a household these days.</comment>

<comment>This would be useful if it showed the fact that when unpaid and paid work are combined, men work more.http://www.pewsocialtrends.org...I guess that disrupts the pity party.I also like how much of this unpaid labor ignores home repairs, cutting grass, fixing cars, and basically all stereotypical male versions of unpaid labor.Let us not forget that the commute time difference between men and women also more or less wipes out this difference by itself.Will women not be happy, until they work less than men, work at home less than men, drive less than men, etc etc?I mean, seriously, what happened to equality?</comment>

<comment>Here's my situation. My wife by and large refuses to clean until things are an absolute sty. If I criticize her for it, it turns into a screaming match, so I either clean up after an 8-10 hour day, or I look at garbage, dirty dishes, and stuff on the floor. She does make dinner and takes decent care of the kids. The rest is pretty much me. When I was single, I did my own laundry and paid a cleaning lady $50 a week. My place was clean enough for me. I also spent my days either happily working out at the gym, drinking in bars or on boats with my friends, and occasionally hooking up with pretty women. I had far more sex as a single, than a married, man. Lazy women exist. And any married woman who has kids has their father over a barrel, legally speaking. I do not see large numbers of women working late or doing a huge amount of technically difficult work. Some, but not very many. I know of few women who miss lunches, vacation time, family errands, or maternity leave. Some, but not very many. I love my wife and I do value her. But I very much doubt she will drop over from doing too much housework. </comment>

<comment>What personally gets me is I like to cook and have become very good at it.That does not mean I like HAVING to cook every meal.Every time I try to get her to cook instead of me she says something along the lines of "But you like it" and I try to explain the above.It hasn't worked out so far.In addition to not ever making me food, she does dishes less than myself since we usually cook at my place.Also, I pay for all the food, either at home or out because I make far more than her.She wants a fulfilling job.  I know i need one that pays well.  She says she is happy with her income, but constantly complains about not being able to afford anything.She wants me to marry her so she can be a stay at home dog mom.I personally make a pretty good deal of money, because I grew up poor and focused on never being that way again.  Now I'm top 5% in income in my age bracket and she seems happy to feed off of that income.  I however want to retire early so that i do not work as a wage slave forever.I am conflicted.  I mean I like her but the above are big points of contention for me.Sunk cost fallacy maybe.</comment>

<comment>Sweet talk her. Tone matters when asking spouses or SI for things. People don't like to be criticized, esp males. I learned the art of baby talk and nice gestures helps to get stuff done. We are all such procrastinators.  </comment>

<comment>Let's say there are only two things a household needs, Cash compensation and Home Labor. Assign a cash value to the Home Labor, add the cash compensation and divide by two.  Who is contributing more to the household?</comment>

<comment>Maybe Melinda Gates wants everyone to have nannies and maids like she does.</comment>

<comment>when one spouse contributes 99.99999 % of the household income, I would not expect that person to do 50% of the household labor as well.  That would not be fair.</comment>

<comment>That was my thought halfway through the article.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. I also cringed at the thought of Bill Gates urging some guy in Tanzania to haul more water.</comment>

<comment>That made me laugh. So true. Until Bill hauls his own water for a day or two... he should probably mind his own business. </comment>

<comment>Why? The guy in Tanzania's wife is doing it.</comment>

<comment>Think about having to bust your ass all day long farming, mining, driving a cab, whatever, and some guy flies in on a G-5 and tells you you're not pitching in around the house enough to suit him. Even if it's true, Gates is the wrong person to say it. That's the job of the village elder, the Imam, or the priest.</comment>

<comment>As a single man, I do 100% of the household work.  Other single men and women the world over do the same thing.</comment>

<comment>You need to take yourself to court to compensate yourself.</comment>

<comment>Taking care of yourself is a basic adult expectation, although many married men don't even do that. How about taking care of children and elderly family members as well?</comment>

<comment>Let's incorporate the truth that many men and women have dramatically less skill at homemaking than did their parents.If you doubt this, note the absolute explosion in 'heat and ready to eat' aisles of refrigerated/frozen food at a typical grocery.Watch and see these cabinets representing the majority of purchases for many.No, not all of them are buying "...over 3,000 calories ready to eat in less than 30 minutes" because they 'have no time.'We are in a far too sedentary (microwave on the way to obesity) culture.</comment>

<comment>It's actually a "no time" thing for a lot of middle class families.  If you're dual income with kids, you both get home around 6 o'clock and kids want to eat right away.  When we were dual income, we made enough money for healthy and quick options, as well as time on the weekends to cook and stash easy to assemble things in the fridge like cooked chicken and whole grain, cut vegetables, shredded cheese, and assembled things from the health food counter like kale salads and bean enchiladas.  This was expensive however, and not all working class people can afford it.. so they go the cheap and fast route.  I'm not saying it can't be done on a budget, but it takes considerably more effort.In my experience, cheap and fast = unhealthy.  Expensive and fast = healthy.</comment>

<comment>Would anyone acknowledge that many have bought into the idea of "eat right away" and then that becomes the habit and expectation?Too many (moms mostly) fall into the "I must feed my family first, over everything else--otherwise, I'm not a good mother" kind of thinking.And resentment can then come right around the corner, particularly, if their spouse is perceived as 'not helping.'Perhaps, the kids and the adult who's not in the kitchen could do other things for a short period (and wouldn't that be great if it could be outdoor play?)--and if it seems difficult, try it just once a week.  Even younger kids might actually be able to perform part of the preparations, some of the time.  And, maybe once or twice a week, the 'non-cooking' spouse might be able to take charge of some of this.</comment>

<comment>I agree with this.. we've had healthy snacks for when we get home and then a later dinner.  My kids do chores and homework while we prepare the meal.  After dinner we all relax and they get some TV/gaming time before the bath, books, bed routine.I've often thought school just started too early in this country.  Part of why dinner is early for kids is that they have to get up so early they need to go to bed early in order to get adequate sleep.  I'd rather take time preparing a meal together as a family and then eat later.  We might try this.. it costs a lot otherwise to get healthy food on the table, and I love to cook so it would be a nice way to wind down after work.  The kids could just start the bath, books, bed routine right after dinner.  I'm ok with cutting out weekday television. Hmmm...Thanks!</comment>

<comment>Here's another imbalance the article doesn't even touch on:  the amount of unpaid work an army of moms do at our public schools.  We insist we spend too much on education, and yet most public schools couldn't even function without the work moms do on a daily basis:  shuttle kids on field trips, act as "class moms" who are essentially the teachers' admins for grading, organizing, and parent outreach, acting as aides for reading groups or library assistance, organizing book fairs, PTA fundraising for classroom essentials, getting carpools organized for extra-curricular activities like team sports away games, music competitions and performances, sewing and fitting costumes for plays and dance concerts--the list is endless.And it's been my experience that the more moms give, the more they are asked to give above and beyond what they are already doing. I've been saying for a long time that moms with kids in public schools should literally go on strike so that our state governments will calculate the true cost of a public education and get serious about funding it.  Parents in the 50s, 60s, and 70s rarely step foot onto their kids' school campuses because they didn't have to.</comment>

<comment>Good point. Thanks for contributing some useful information!</comment>

<comment>not sure we should be praising moms for stepping up in the face of failures by government.</comment>

<comment>It's a failure of the public, specifically the failure to insist that education be prioritized over tax cuts for the rich, that brought us to this place. In a representative democracy, we pick the government, so if the government fails, it's on us to recognize the failure and make replacements as is necessary.</comment>

<comment>The United States - including both secondary education AND colleges - spends more on education per capita than any country in the world.WTF are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>"Per capita" comparisons don't take into account cost of living in those countries, which makes comparing them completely pointless and apples-to-zebras. Yes, people living in grass and mud huts DO spend less per person on education than we do--they also have a lower cost of living. Our teachers live in the United States, which has a sky-high cost of living.</comment>

<comment>The only country IN THE WORLD that spends more than we do is Norway.</comment>

<comment>Are you trying to say "As a percentage of GDP," perhaps? That would be a better basis for comparison, but unfortunately the one you've chosen doesn't support your point of view that we spend "Too much" on education.See, the Norwegians spend more (and get more out of it) than we do. If Norway as an example supported your point of view, the facts would have to be exactly opposite (i.e. that they're doing more with less than us, not that they're doing more with more than us.)Because more-with-more is like--duh, they better be getting better results.</comment>

<comment>agreed</comment>

<comment>I'm not. Pointing out how much we take for granted in volunteerism which, back in the day, was fully funded. </comment>

<comment>Teachers are treated the same way--and it's probably not coincidental that most teachers are women, and so are most moms. The attitude I hear back (Regularly) when I point out how much teachers spend out of their pay to provide supplies that should be supplied by the schools: "Who cares? Their husbands probably work too."No concept of a clue that it's wrong to make your employees make up shortfalls in your budget out of their own pockets.</comment>

<comment>I taught for 8 years and finally decided that it 'cost' too much. I have two daughters and I found myself forced to grade papers and plan lessons (for at least 2 hours a night) instead of giving them my undivided attention. They are increasing the expectations within the classrooms and demands... but teachers are burning out. </comment>

<comment>Indeed, I had a long-term girlfriend who got out of teaching for the same reason. Literally, an award-winning teacher, did more for her students than you could possibly imagine, had the happiest classroom full of kids delighted to get to school every day, and was the most effective teacher in her school. No Child Left Behind pushed her out. She taught at (literally) the best funded and highest performing school in the district, top-three in our whole state. And the problem they had was they kept getting dinged because their "scores weren't going up."Yes--because they're already the highest in the state! It ground her down to a nub to be constantly berated in the press over the "poor performance" (of her top-three in the state school) based solely on test scores and zero on actual-learning. She took a position out of the classroom for two years to lock-in her pension and then bailed for the private sector, where she more than doubled her pay in a little over 18 months, never got berated by some knowitall conservative "reformer" again, works 40 hour weeks year-round (instead of 80-90 hour weeks during the school year and 20 hour weeks during summer "vacation."It's nothing short of a structured, organized plan to destroy public education--to eliminate large groups of politically powerful people opposed to privatizing everything for the benefit of the richest of the rich.</comment>

<comment>I'm in my 13th year teaching.  I happen to love it, but it is a grind right about now (end of February).  At least it's light when I go to school and light when I come home.  Right now I have no energy to read to my own children at night, however.  I used to have a better evening routine.  High school (where I am, for the second year) includes so much extra-curricular volunteerism.</comment>

<comment>Add in aging parents and you have a burden that is breaking women</comment>

<comment>You don't think we fund education?</comment>

<comment>No we aren't. The funds allocated for public schools are raided for other things by Congress and what is leftover is being given to failing corporate owned charter schoolsEvery one of my teacher friends must use their salaries to buy books, paper, pens etc for the students</comment>

<comment>Hilarious.Washington D.C. spends, for example, $30,000 per kid.  And manages to produce extremely poor outcomes.The U.S. spends more - per capita - on secondary education than nearly any other country in the world.Have you ever looked at a single number?  Or - do you just go with talking points?</comment>

<comment>$18,667 check for each child,    http://www.washingtonexaminer....And the bulk of that money as all pupil money goes to the top administrators...not to the students and teachers</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Build lots less expensive facilities and make administrators responsible for educations children are getting, not just the teachers.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  So, fire half of the educrats and re-invest into the kids.If we fund it more, we will simply pay the existing people more and/or create more bureaucracy - nothing will improve.</comment>

<comment>Too much administration is a bad choice for a school district to make, I agree.</comment>

<comment>Omg johnjmac do you even have kids in public school? You need a damn reality check. Parents are asked to do an endless array of free work because of supposed budget constraints. You sound so wooden and uninformed like a puppet who keeps chanting the same dumb mantra so it won't hear anything contrary to its unexamined opinion. </comment>

<comment>On average - schools receive plenty of money. The fact that they waste it - 50% or so on admin - and often produce poor outcomes is another issue.</comment>

<comment>I challenge you to go sit in on several school board meetings in your district and learn where the money is going and how your schools are paid for.  You will find that the money is not "wasted" in the least.  Keep in mind that a good chunk of school district dollars are also earmarked for special ed, which is federally mandated.  It's the most expensive type of services--necessary, but expensive--and the remaining budget is distributed for general ed. Could it be that your famed Washington, DC example has a good chunk of its student population in need of special services?  Wouldn't surprise me, given the level of poverty in that area.</comment>

<comment>Not to the extent it should be, no. </comment>

<comment>Not adequately.  And it gets more expensive as buildings age.</comment>

<comment>Amen. I was thinking the same thing while reading the article and comments. At least here in California the parents are expected to donate a ton of time to help run the library, run the book fairs, make photocopies, man the crosswalk, coordinate hot lunch program, drive on field trips ... All for free and in the middle of normal 9-5 work hours! And drop off and pickup kids daily since there is no bus service anymore in most districts. I find myself wishing these well intentioned volunteer parents would just quit doing it all for free and force the state to pay what it's supposed to -- so I and other parents can keep earning a living and pay our property taxes that are supposed to keep the schools running. My parents never had to set foot in the classroom to provide free labor, and friends of mine in the UK are shocked when I tell them how it is here in public school. The requests are endless. My feeling: Hire a a PAID bus driver for field trips! Hire a librarian! Get a paid admin to make photocopies and make Staples runs! Pay somebody to coordinate your hot lunch program and to supervise the playground! It's one more example of how (mostly) women are expected to do endless grunt work for free, during the middle of normal work hours, out of the goodness of their hearts --couched in a noble mission of "helping" complete with guilt trip if you refuse.</comment>

<comment>I live in suburban SF.  But friends in NY, NJ and Seattle report similar issues. </comment>

<comment>Nothing sells more written word and advertising in America than women-as-victims. They have an insatiable appetite for it. Don't want to do chores? DON'T. Stop whining. No wonder men are avoiding marriage in droves.</comment>

<comment>Women too. Its not like "the ring" is still the ultimate goal for all ladies today. Sorry!</comment>

<comment>Amen </comment>

<comment>This is a bunch of B.S.My father's generation worked and maybe did the yard and took care of the finances.You wouldn't find them anywhere near a kitchen or laundry room.</comment>

<comment>And who made that possible? Hmm? Your comments are so funny! </comment>

<comment>My point is that my generation, including me, does a hell of a lot more around the house vs our fathers.But that doesn't keep the feminists from complaining now does it?</comment>

<comment>In the U.S. at least, men have longer commutes and work longer hours.  Men's total time commitment to the household is equal to women's or greater.Also there are the studies that couples in which the men do more traditionally-female chores have less sex.  To know what women really want, watch what they do, not what they say.</comment>

<comment>"men have longer commute": your source?Fair chore division, less sex? Actually, a study from the University of Alberta had exactly opposite findings. Maybe the secret for these poor sex-deprived gentlemen is to see so-called "feminine" chores not as "feminine", but as chores, simply, that need to be done.And yes, women can push a landmower too. Many do, actually.</comment>

<comment>OECD--same as the source in this article. Men average 79 minutes, women 61.   http://www.aei.org/publication...As for the other, it appears there's research on both sides.  http://daily.jstor.org/housewo..."Push a lawnmower," or as the lesbians call it, scissoring.</comment>

<comment>Nobody paid me to shovel snow this morning but the way that I look at it is that I didn't have to pay anyone to do it for me.  Entitlement mentality.</comment>

<comment>The author's belief that spouses do not share income is bizarre.She seems to favor radical change to divorce law</comment>

<comment>I take offense at chores being called "womens work". I live solo, as do many men and women, and we do our own laundry, cooking, gardening, cleaning, and so forth. Its called being self-sufficient. My parents taught me by 12 and expected me to mow the lawn, take out the trash, do the dishes, make my meals, etc. Ive been doing it ever since. (Although my last comment there brings up another point - this should be work for the kids in the house, regardless of gender. And before you think I am a curmudgeon yes there is plenty of time for play after the chores are done.)</comment>

<comment>"As many a sleep-deprived mom can attest ..."  Uh, the graphic shows that in most countries, women sleep more per day than men.  That doesn't mean they aren't sleep deprived, and assuming they are, then the dads are even more sleep deprived.</comment>

<comment>Men can't be victims here, this is the Atlantic!</comment>

<comment>You should publish how much time is spent at paid work too so the total of paid and unpaid work between men and women can be compared. You suggest men should do more unpaid work, but without showing the total amount of work (paid & unpaid) done by men is significantly less than women, you can't support that suggestion.</comment>

<comment>Please, if your screenname doesn't indicate your sex clearly, include your sex in your comments. I so want to make some correlations here!</comment>

<comment>Where are you going to get the time to do that? Don't you have some dirty diapers to change, Beta?</comment>

<comment>Naw, I'm sitting around on TheAtlantic while my wife's at work!</comment>

<comment>Well I'm sure something needs done around the house! Does she leave you a list? Do you get a gold star for each chore you do?</comment>

<comment>What means "Beta", please?</comment>

<comment>Do these studies include going through the mail, paying bills, understanding retirement accounts, health plans, etc.? In other words, are some chores excluded? Also, are different standards the man and the woman have taken into account? If a man is comfortable with a 7 out of 10 clean kitchen, but the woman takes on the work because she insists on a 9 out of 10 clean kitchen?A better understanding would be to conduct a study on single people and how much time single men devote to housework vs. how much time single women devote housework, once commuting times have been normalized. </comment>

<comment>All single people have to deal with food preparation and basic cleaning. In many households, the males do none of those things, as evidenced above.Also, the chores you list (and that you seem to assume men do more frequently) are once-in-awhile chores.  Checking in on the retirement accounts is not the same as grocery shopping, cooking dinner and cleaning up after everyone every single damn day.</comment>

<comment>My point is that if, speaking hypothetically and in general, if single men are more comfortable with a less clean house and simpler meals than single women are, is the woman in a couple doing more chores the result of the man not doing enough, or the woman wanting things done to a higher standard?</comment>

<comment>This article is an example of repeating a lie so often that it begins to be accepted as truth.</comment>

<comment>Like the wage gap...</comment>

<comment>I guess I'm helping save the world, then - I do most of the daily chores around our apartment. (Not that I mind!)</comment>

<comment>Give me a break, I would guess that in our house for my wife's chores are at worst equitable at best balanced in her favor.  For example, the person who cleans up from meals is not the person who cooks.  Cooking probably takes a little longer than cleaning up.  I would estimate she cooks 80% of the time and I clean up 80%.  However, I would much prefer to cook since it involves a lot of time chatting, drinking wine and watching TV through the kitchen window into the living room.  Moreover, I like to cook (so does she).  OTOH, cleaning up just pretty much sucks. I am guessing my wife thinks cleaning up stinks too as she rarely does all elements of it when it is her turn.  For example, the stove is not polished and she won't empty the dishwasher if it is needed she leaves it to me the next evening or morning.  Best yet, the cook is the first one done in the evening and able to hit preferred activities.From the outside looking in, if one were to look at the evening dinner chore account it would look like the cook is getting the shaft on time when in reality the cook has a much better deal. I also do the weekly laundry about 80% of the time as quite frankly, she stinks at it.  But then again, while laundry may take all day to get done, it is really only about 1 hour of actual work and get to read in between loads.  Outside, I mow, maintain the siding and gutters and shovel snow as necessary.  She works on the flower beds.  The flower beds can be very time consuming but she claims to enjoy doing it.  If it was left up to me most of them would become grass but she likes it so they exist.  In short, I am happy with how our house runs, but breaking down chores simply by time is way too simplistic as not all chores are the same.</comment>

<comment>In my experience many parents don't even bother teaching their children how to do certain chores because its a "girl-job" or "boy-job".  Some chore "traditions" are very old (home cooking is almost universally a female job) or fairly new (lawn mowing for instance is considered men's work).  Think about the last time you saw a commercial with a man cooking dinner vs a women (or better yet, a mom vs a dad), and if its dad's night for dinner, I bet he took the kids out for fast food, lest the poor schlubb burn the house down.Even in movies the opposite gender is commonly portrayed as incompetent doing a simple chore of the opposite gender.  I once saw a movie were the dad couldn't run a load of laundry without destroying the clothes.  It can send a strong message to the viewer, however the reality is anyone can cook, clean or mow the lawn.</comment>

<comment>Why not present a study on 'hours spent working' rather than only showing unpaid work?Is it so that you can present a better narrative ("Men don't do their share of housework") while ignoring any possible nuance (we might have different work)?It seems to me that the underlying thought here is that women can't join the workforce as thoroughly as men because they don't have the time to, because housework.  if that is the actual case, then, sure, run with it.It doesn't seem to account for the fact that it is simpler and easier in many cases to have men work out of the house and women in it.  Not saying that's always the right mix, or the desired one- my wife wants to be at least mostly stay-at-home if/when we get to have kids, but she makes significantly more than me currently.  Of course, she has a career (webdev) that's much more adapted toward work-from-home and freelance, so that helps.It's odd to me that labor specialization is a huge boon in every other facet of life, but, in homelife, we want every person to be a Renaissance man/woman.</comment>

<comment>At the very least, add the averages of paid work time to the charts as separate bars.Or separate out people's data who don't work outside the home.</comment>

<comment>One area this article doesn't touch at all is the burden of elderly care that falls mostly on women. I'm at the age where many of my friends have aging parents and it falls to the women, who are still working paid jobs, to handle. This is added to the burden of doing the bulk of teenage care, house care, and marriage.Today we still place the burden of a marriage's success or failure on the woman's shoulders. We still expect the women to take off work when a child falls ill. We expect the women to be the active parent in the children's school. We place the burden of elderly care and decisions on the woman regardless of the aging parents being the woman's parents or the man's. All this while the majority of women are still in the workforce. I know my friends, all successful financially are breaking under the burden.</comment>

<comment>It's an interesting mix for us.  My wife will likely take on most of the 'social' burdens and the bulk of the housework when/if we have kids.The rub is, she makes more money than me, and I'd likely be better at the at-home stuff.  So, we're actually looking at sacrificing practicality for desire.</comment>

<comment>This is the single most ridiculous article I have ever read on the internet - I'm going to unfollow the Atlantic and stop wasting my time on this drivel right now - goodbye ...</comment>

<comment>Suuuure you will! And you wanted to send a "I'm serious this time!" goodbye kvetch, just to make sure we all knew you were gone!We won't miss you.</comment>

<comment>Go easy, he has housework to do.</comment>

<comment>i am getting tired of this nonsense.  i do all the cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc. in the apartment i share with my girlfriend.  lots of men do this.  lots of men raise kids too.  it's not hard to understand.</comment>

<comment>Apparently, being able to say, "Wow, that chart does not represent my reality." is difficult?  Do you not understand the concept of an average?</comment>

<comment>It seems the most average of people can not comprehend being so average!</comment>

<comment>I commend you, but I think you should get a new girlfriend. My husband works 60+ hours a week, & I usually do about 50 at home (yes, I've timed it) Making almost every meal from scratch, remodeling the house, every day cleaning, childcare, etc.  If I could make the kind of money he does, he would stay home. Instead of totally abandoning kids to institutions, why not gain equality by making it more acceptable for men to stay at home if it makes sense? The business world is not changing towards home/life balance even though some might talk about it. Men and women both work hard. Is only paid work worthwhile? No. It may be holding women back in poor countries but in general, middle class America it's all about perceptions and expectations.</comment>

<comment>Look, if girls wanted to get paid, they should have chosen to be born with penises just like us men did. Society shouldn't have to pay for their bad choices!</comment>

<comment>Well, now you can just choose to live in the middle no matter what chromosomes your dad gave you.</comment>
