<comment>> perhaps not creating but at least enabling institutions such as slavery (in which people can be bought)I suppose it depends on how exactly you define "slavery".  I guess definitions get a bit murky when neither the "free" nor the "enslaved" are being paid for their labor.Native American tribes were known to take captors from enemy tribes during war.  They would also give people as gifts, either to members of their own tribe or to other tribes.</comment>

<comment>Have an Amish-Mennonite great x 10 grandfather and two sons who were captured by French allied Indians during the French and Indian War. The tribe was the Lanni Lanape (Delaware) people. My grandfather and his sons were "owned" by the Lanni Lanape. The Lanni Lanape eventually traded them to the Seneca, an Iroquios people with a completely different language and culture. After about three years as "slaves" of the Seneca all three of them were ceremonially initiated as full Seneca tribal members.See Northkill Amish settlement Berks County Pennsylvania.</comment>

<comment>Very interesting :)</comment>

<comment>In many societies, slavery was intended to pay a debt. If you were broke and could not pay your creditors, you would have to work for them until your debt was repaid and labor, then set free. Prisoners of war were also enslaved, but depending on the society that enslaved them, they could also be set free after a certain amount of time or buy their freedom by doing something.Slavery in the American South completely broke with ancient tradition by turning slavery from a temporary conditions for the poorest and the conquered into a permanent state based on the color of one's skin. Maybe that's what the author meant by "enabling institutions in which people can be bough," reducing a fellow human being to a finite amount of labor, setting a price based on this, and selling him or her like we sell machinery today, rather than working off a debt incurred by war or loaning money in the ancient sense.</comment>

<comment>That's an overly romantic view of historical slavery.  More often it was chattel slavery, and not just for life:  generations were enslaved.</comment>

<comment>Historically there have been many different forms of slavery, not all of which, as you rightly point out, coexisted with money or involved buying and selling slaves.</comment>

<comment>I live in Manila and I can tell you that "gift economies" can describe a significant amount of the economic activity in poor neighborhoods. Poverty, especially of the kind found in developing countries, is a social evil that must be vigorously addressed, but it need not be a death sentence for people in the slums. They share what they have among themselves, anything from rice and sugar to beer.</comment>

<comment>The gift economy sounds like a fairy tale to me, some precursor of the communist vision. Unless human nature has changed a whole lot, the ancients acted in their own self-interest. A lot more likely is a system of credit based on the value of some commodity. If rice is the basic staple food, you buy and sell things based on their value in pounds of rice. You keep track of how many pounds are owed to you and how many you owe, and you can clear the account with rice or with other goods valued in rice. In other words, the basic idea of money preceded physical coins. Once the public has the idea of money, you can replicate this system with units of money instead of rice, but still have a situation where physical money isn't involved.Even after money was invented, official, government-issued money was in short supply in many places. Systems of bookkeeping and credit therefore lasted until quite recently, allowing you to run a tab at the local store or bar.</comment>

<comment>The gift economy exists.  If you don't feel like working, the government will someone a gift.</comment>

<comment>Sorry - it doesn't exist in our society except in abstract forms that never work well. It does, however, exist to a limited extent in our small rural communities. It's no accident that they tend to be conservatives.</comment>

<comment>Where is the proof of this statement?  It certainly exists in families, where, for example, grandparents care for their grandchildren while their parents work, without pay.  It exists in churches where meals are provided after funerals or for the sick as needed - no quid pro quo.  It occurs in schools, when parents volunteer their time and money to aid not only their children, but the classmates of their children.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it exists, and it should grow. But it is an ever decreasing part of the scheme of things. You mention, for example, the activities churches, but are you aware of how churches are steadily disappearing from our society? Grandparents? Perhaps you haven't noticed that many couples no longer live near enough to them to make a difference. The main reason, of course, is that people have to go where the work is. And where do you find parents with the time to tutor their own children, never mind their children's classmates. The market economy interferes and actually destroys the "gift" economy.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, I think that you are right and it is in the decline in the US.  Hopefully, that decline can be stopped and reversed, but, other than Pope Francis, there aren't many leaders encouraging this.</comment>

<comment>I'm don't think gift economies are decreasing.  They're just changing.  There may be fewer people whose lives are exclusively focused around a church, or in a close extended family, two examples you give.  But as old institutions decline, new ones emerge.  Witness the large scale festivals like Burning Man, replete with structured gift economies. Or look at the growing practice of people taking long hikes, such as on the Appalachian Trail or Pacific Crest Trail, and receiving and offering meals and help along the way.I'm not knocking capitalism.  But at the same time, people seem to want to make a closer human connection to those they trade with, and a gift economy can fulfill that role.</comment>

<comment>A church meal after a funeral does not a full economy make, kmihindu. Not one of the examples you listed is an example of a "gift economy". They are examples of occasional gift-giving, which exists in every society and always has. But that an entire economy could be based on that is absurd nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Honestly, you people need friends. The gift economy is alive and well in the US. I don't know whether to be amused or saddened by the denial of the phenomenon of give and take among modern Americans. You really do not let your neighbor use your power washer, they really don't bring you a case of beer in return!?! Because in my neighborhood, a mowed lawn for granny in exchange for homemade strudel is, if not common, definitely not unheard of.I live in the Northwest US. And this is not a poor neighborhood.</comment>

<comment>Very true. Rather than poverty-stricken areas, gift economies manifest themselves as micro-economies, usually with social currency, among close-knit groups of individuals. Evolutionarily, this is a product of tribal communities, which are further products of primate communities, of which its members very often exhibit altruistic behavior.</comment>

<comment>You don't know how lucky you are! The gifting you cite are steadily disappearing from the American social scene.</comment>

<comment>We are both lucky and grateful, but I disagree that our situation is as rare as you suggest. At least not west of the Rockies or north of the Redwoods. We have traveled and lived around Washington and Oregon. Reaching out, this non-white, middle to upper middle class from poor kid has found much kindness across the political spectrum, rural, urban, and among all religions. Reach out. You might be surprised.</comment>

<comment>As I wrote my last reply to you, I was thinking about the far west - that it might be different, but I remain to be convinced. At any rate, social scientists have been working on this and related issue for at least a decade on a directly related subject, volunteerism. Robert Putman's "Bowling Alone: America's Declining Social Capital" is one of the early works on the issue. He has lots of evidence that it has been steadily declining, but there's controversy about his conclusions.As to your experience, maybe it's widespread, but I doubt it. Relying on journalistic accounts is invariably wrong on a subject like this. (example: The NYT journalist distorted the story about the Kitty Genovese murder case, claiming a whole neighborhood watched from their windows Kitty being raped and assaulted killed when it was simply not the case).</comment>

<comment>Those are occasional exchanges. Not one of your examples is evidence of a full "gift economy". The gift economy is even more fictional than the barter economy this article is ostensibly trashing.</comment>

<comment>"Unless human nature has changed a whole lot, the ancients acted in their own self-interest."The problem is, what you're thinking of as "human nature" is quite anachronistic.  It's incredibly difficult to avoid making assumptions that are not inextricably intertwined with never having existed outside modern economies.</comment>

<comment>So if human nature doesn't exist, what does?  Mores in almost every culture are vastly the same--don't murder, get married, don't steal.  It's really remarkable.  And were talking lost tribesmen in the Amazon to ancient Greece to the jungles of Cambodia.</comment>

<comment>Where did I say it doesn't exist?I merely suggested that it's problematic to try and define it without discounting for myriad influences on, and preconceptions in, our Twenty-first Century minds.</comment>

<comment>So, just curious, do you have any evidence at all for your idea? It sounds like a nice thought - but in the end you need to find some sort of evidence that this worked for some society. The problem with any idea / hypothesis is that we seldom understand everything and the factors we ignore because we think they are insignificant may be very important. So, let's hear the supporting evidence for this.</comment>

<comment>It sounds like a fairy tale to you because it couldn't work in a large society that depends in our case on an incredibly complex division of labor and a very mobile population. The proof that it can exist over hundreds of thousands of years is that our species survived in gift economies so long. And in addition, anthropologists haven't found any example that contradicts the principle.</comment>

<comment>This misses the point, my friend. Before government-issued money existed, there's no evidence of currency existing, even commodities acting as currency. If there would, there would certainly be written evidence.Human nature as being motivated by self-interest is a myth. It's been dispelled by sociology, evolutionary biology, psychology, and anthropology, as we've seen here. We make choices that are often in our own self-interest, but only in rarer cases are those decisions purposely negatively affecting others. If I, an American, were to ask a stranger from off the street to temporarily hold about $200.00, it's more likely than not that the stranger would hold on to the money rather than keep it.Don't confuse me in believing I think human nature is selflessness, though. Human nature itself is a myth, and at best it can be used to describe a culturally-dependent mode of human behavior.</comment>

<comment>LOL.  Human nature isn't motivated by self-interest.  Then two sentences later you say we make choices in self-interest.  Which is it?  And your example fails.  One person may hold on to the money because he believes it is in his best interest to be known as an honest, trustworthy person.  Another may just take the money because he believes it is in his self-interest to have $200.  People can argue all day about which is the best choice, but each choice is informed by self-interest.</comment>

<comment>Allow me to "break it down for you," as they say. First, I state there's no such thing as human nature. But if there were, it would at best be a mode of human behavior, in other words, the most common behavioral choices measured by statistical patterns. Just like how a cold streak doesn't dismiss the idea that the climate is warming, a few choices made in self-interest do not mean that all of humanity is veered towards self-interest. Perhaps a few individuals out of the whole are precluded to selfishness. Perhaps some people who are otherwise selfless make a few selfish choices. Perhaps the large amount of selfishness is a product of the culture of your city, your county, your state, or your nation.Second, we can argue that the moral reason of the stranger keeping the money is dubious. However, to believe that this stranger wants to make a lasting impression on another stranger is silly, to say the least. I wouldn't care what someone who I never talk to thinks of me. So why would I care if stranger X thinks I'm trustworthy? If I care about my image, there's no reason why I shouldn't take the money and run. Perhaps you could argue that I fear imprisonment. That's more reasonable than a character judgement. Further, your prescribed motivation of self-interest is more dubious. What if the stranger is in poverty and can't support a family? The 200 would seem very tempting.The world is a lot more complicated, darling. To top this discussion off, we both are speaking out of a purely western cultural context. That's hardly a fourth of the world population. Hardly a fraction of the the history of humanity. </comment>

<comment>You confuse self-interest with selfishness.  Those are not the same thing at all.And who says person left holding the money wants to make the lasting impression on the stranger?  We live a society.  Others know us and see us act even if the stranger doesn't. The person who patiently holds the money solidifies his reputation as honest and trustworthy.  He can tell the story to his friends and acquaintances.  Other strangers may watch the transaction and admire him.  Maybe the person who asked him to hold the money comes back and rewards him or befriends him.  There are many positives associated with being honest that don't entirely depend on the stranger's reaction.And I don't see how the motivation of self-interest is "dubious."  Take your example of the poor person who may steal the money.  He clearly sees it in his best interest to take the money and help his family.  Alternately, he may hold the money because he thinks it's in his best interest to be known as an honest person.  People want to employ honest people.  Like I said, which choice is best or rational is up for debate, but the fact that both decisions are made in self-interest is not.And please don't patronize me, darling.  This entire country was founded on the social contract theory which recognizes enlightened self-interest.  And this has absolutely nothing to do with Western culture, hence HUMAN NATURE? Honesty is regarded in all cultures, as is providing for your family.  Or, if you wish, please explain how the people of a non-Western culture don't act in self-interest.  Choose any current or past culture.  None of those cultures exist.</comment>

<comment>Patronization is but one of the many things I'm mistaken for, darling. I don't mean it to be so, but, alas, many are such deceived by their own preclusions. Perhaps you should look me up, so you can learn who I am.Your definition of self-interest is what we in the academic world call to be a crutch. Similar to moved goal posts, in it, you rest your assumptions of the world on this definition, and it molds and conforms to whatever pressure you need at the time. Man risks his own life to save someone else? He wants to be known as a hero. Woman goes to church to ask for forgiveness? She wants to go to heaven. Man pains himself every day to bring home food for the family? He's wanting to secure the safe passage of his genetics.Often, the world we see is a projection of ourself. We do not know and can't preclude to know what people are thinking. That is why your claim is dubious. Some people try, but invariably they are simply projecting themselves and their thoughts. So perhaps everything you do is in your own self-interest?I believe you may have misunderstood my final paragraph. It wasn't a justification of my argument through the western world, but rather an expression of sadness at how our experiences are incredibly limited to the western world, and we can't speak at length of anything not pertaining to the western world.However, I disagree completely with your stance."The person who patiently holds the money solidifies his reputation as honest and trustworthy"To whom? You overestimate the observance of people."He can tell the story to his friends and acquaintances"He could just as easily tell the story if he took the money. Why would he base his decision off of this?"Maybe the person who asked him to hold the money comes back and rewards him or befriends him."Again, I doubt that this would be a thought process. When this study was performed, most people didn't take this into account.If the poor person were struggling to feed his family, then wouldn't it be in his self-interest to simply abandon the family and more easily support himself? That seems the most self-sustaining option.</comment>

<comment>Self interest extends to doing things that in the short term are non-beneficial in order to benefit in the longer term by living in a society that improves your chances of survival and reproduction. We're a social, cooperative species, it's the only way we've survived as long as we have.</comment>

<comment>You are ignoring that it is entirely possible to understand one's "self-interest" as being part of a well-ordered, supportive society that sees to everyone's needs. cooperation is as much a paradigm in nature and society as competition. It just depends where you are willing to look</comment>

<comment>Exactly, if you keep breaking the rules of a society you're either going to cause it to break down or find yourself outside of it. Both of which would dramatically reduce your chances of survival and reproduction.</comment>

<comment>You have been brainwashed by the exact myth which the article refutes.  Humans have not always been money grubbing cogs in an economic machine.  What people really desire, once their basic survival needs are satisfied, is the respect of their peers.  Associating that with material wealth is a recent development.  A few hundred years ago people who made money were looked down upon by the nobility.  People had other rules for measuring out respect within their economic class.As technical progress has made it possible for more people to take basic survival needs for granted, I think we are seeing the worship of money coming to an end.  Young people care less about what kind of car you are driving then how many followers you have on Instagram.  None of us here know how large each other's houses are.   People who do acquire boatloads of money buy sports teams and hang out with celebrities to gain recognition.  New college grads are finding their economic prospects dim, yet they have less desire for it.</comment>

<comment>You are correct that status is the basic driver for humans, not "stuff."However, you are historically inaccurate by saying that status and wealth have not been connected in the past.The fact is that in the past wealth flowed from power, usually political or military power, for the simple reason that those with power took stuff by force from others.Only in the last few centuries, first in England and the Netherlands, and then expanding into more and more areas, has rule of law permitted those without power to keep their wealth and build on it. People for the first time became able to build wealth simply by providing things others wanted.Eventually, this led us to the present situation, in which power and status in society flows mainly from wealth, rather than the historically reverse flow.We seem to presently be headed back towards the past, where political power and influence leads to both status and wealth, with those who have gained wealth by providing goods and services others freely purchase being looted for the rulers' benefit.</comment>

<comment>I didn't mean to imply there was no connection between wealth and status.  But, the main determinant of status was the social class you were born into.   No doubt barons competed to enlarge their holdings, but the wealth of most people did not change very much over their life.  So, they distinguished themselves by other virtues.  I think we have even seen that in more recent history.  In the 1950's when top marginal income tax rates were 90%, people could not so easily pull ahead of others financially.  So, high achievers sought to distinguish themselves by being pillars of the community rather than having the most pillars on their homes.</comment>

<comment>Barely anyone actually paid those tax rates and that was an era of rampant tax loopholes</comment>

<comment>Yes, that's the point.  Nobody paid those rates because nobody got paid that kind of salary if 90% would go to the government anyway.  CEO's made 20 times what workers made, instead of 200.   A star like Stan Musial was paid only 100K.   That didn't stop kids from looking up to ball players.  It did stop them from imagining they could just be a drug dealer instead and have just as big a house.I know there were plenty of loopholes as well, but some of those had social benefit, e.g., more charitable giving rather than routing welfare through the government.</comment>

<comment>So how do cogs "grub" money? It's a bit unclear, actually, how anyone grubs money, as it implies--doesn't it?--that money is lying around just for the picking or pulling up (I know it's a cliche, but can't figure out why it's lasted so long. I don't think anyone is said to do much grubbing of anything nowadays. Bears going after grubs, maybe?).I think it is true that respect is a more primal motivation than the accumulation of money. But respect of "peers"? Who are these peers? And why do you limit the desired respect to that of peers? Wouldn't the respect of total inferiors--seeing as how we're talking about primordialness--be preferable? Or, even more preferably yet, the respect of abject slaves that you have succeeded in totally dominating--wouldn't that be the best respect of all?This is how Hegel presented the primordial drive for respect, and I think "peer" is most likely a complete and sentimentalizing anachronism in this context.My understanding of the native gift-culture potlatches of the American Northwest is that these were used very much for the purpose of domination: to challenge and overwhelm those who receive your gifts, to the point, ideally, where they know they can't return equal value and must implicitly acknowledge their own inferiority.Bottom line: I think you are idealizing and sentimentalizing a past that we are well rid of.And in any case, we already live in a gift culture."Black Friday" came by that designation in part because it represents the moment of the turn to profitability of retailers: in other words, many of them survive because the end of the year orgy of Christmas gift shopping finally puts their accounts into the black. So, a largish chunk of our economy is entirely dependent upon the giving of gifts as it stands.</comment>

<comment>By peers I just meant "other people whose opinions you care about" whoever that may be.  By money "grubbing" I meant going after the pennies, that we are all supposed to be acting as efficient economic calculators aiming for the best deal.  In most cases, we don't really have enough information to do that effectively, were it not for government regulations that insure basic standards for food, medicine, and product safety.   Counting your pennies teaches your brain that anything which costs money must be good, so you end up wanting more things you don't have, to trade your precious pennies for.  And you will barely notice the sunset or the breeze because it is free.</comment>

<comment>"What people really desire, once their basic survival needs are satisfied, is the respect of their peers."  Citation please.Humans actually have always acted in their self-interest whenever possible.  Sometimes it's enlightened self-interest, sometimes it's naked aggression.   Garnering the respect of your peers is self-interest.  Why is that respect important?  Because it make you feel validated or good about yourself or noticed or important.  All of those are self-interested motives.  Trust me, millenial.  Your generation hasn't discovered a new human condition or revolutionized it.  It's inescapable.</comment>

<comment>It may be inescapable for you, but don't presume you speak for everyone.  Or that you can guess where people are coming from.  I'm a baby boomer.  I have made some millions and lost some millions, and seen the value of money from that perspective.  I never said anything about self-interest.  Obviously, you can define that so everything is self-interest if you like it that way.  I was only talking about money.</comment>

<comment>Ever wonder why there's a reason you can define everything as self-interest?  Because of human nature.  And those young people you talk about who value Instagram?  I work with a good number of them.  They're into Instagram, but they also want to earn money and will not hesitate to tell you their money troubles.  The reason millenials (seriously, apologies for thinking you were a millenial--I would be pissed too) complain about job prospects is because they want to earn money.  People want to acquire.  How much they want to acquire varies from person to person, but not even the homeless are possessionless.</comment>

<comment>I think it only sounds like a fairy tale to you because you are thinking about larger societies with many unrelated individuals. If you think about hunter gatherer bands or other small groups that would only contain a couple of families dependent on one another for continued survival it makes perfect sense. In such a situation behaviour that benefits the individual at the expense of the group (like taking but not giving gifts) counterproductive. The lack of keeping a specific record of favours owed and given wouldn't preclude social pressures on someone abusing the system.While we obviously can't be certain about the past, gift economies are also observed by anthropologists to this day which certainly suggests that they existed historically.</comment>

<comment>Wow, sounds like the Gunwinggu people of Australia had an analog version of Tinder going a long time ago. Too bad they didn't monetize it.</comment>

<comment>Maybe there's a survivorship bias issue here? Trading cultures might have all started with barter and quickly developed money because it's an obvious next step. So if you study today's cultures that still haven't developed money, you're left with unrepresentative gift economy ones?Also, it's just not true that cash enabled slavery and imperialism. To name just one counter-example, Ancient Sparta practiced both slavery and imperialism while having a non-cash economy. In fact, one could easily argue that Sparta's enslavement of some of its neighboring states is what enabled its citizens to "enjoy" a non-cash economy and not worry about production and trade.</comment>

<comment>What was Sparta's economic system then?  If not cash, barter, or gift?</comment>

<comment>They forced helots, de facto slaves, to grow stuff for the Spartans, who ate it.</comment>

<comment>Apparently, it was "cash based", though they didn't mint their own coins."The first-century historian Plutarch says of the legendary Spartan lawgiver, Lycurgus (7th century BCE):'…he commanded that all gold and silver coin should be called in, and that only a sort of money made of iron should be current, a great weight and quantity of which was but very little worth; so that to lay up twenty or thirty pounds there was required a pretty large closet, and, to remove it, nothing less than a yoke of oxen…For the iron money could not be carried into the rest of Greece, nor had it any value there, but was rather held in ridicule.'The purpose of this policy was to discourage Spartans from accumulating wealth so they could focus their energies on preparation for war. Plutarch’s chronology is shaky – if Lycurgus actually existed, he probably lived a century before Greeks began to use coins. The Greek word for roasting spits (obeloi,) however, is closely related to the word for a small silver coin (obol), so the connection is credible.Other People’s MoneyAmong themselves, Spartans might use awkward bundles of iron spits for legal or ceremonial transactions, but in dealings with other Greeks they had to use current money. Because of their selective breeding and superb physical fitness, Spartans were serious contenders in the Olympic Games. And all Greeks attending the games, even Spartans, used the special coinage struck by the city of Elis, which managed the sacred site of Olympia."http://www.coinweek.com/featur...</comment>

<comment>Sparta is hard to figure out if you study it.  Wealth was discouraged in Sparta, Iron spikes, sort of like big nails, were the currency.  But there was gold.For lack of a better terms Sparta had a plantation & a state system.  Sparta's army served the state and the Spartan way of life.  So, it would actually be more like a plantation, everything made for itself.  Second, while Sparta had a huge number of slaves they had a vast number of Perioikoi, they were the economic engine of Sparta.  They had coin in order to engage with other city-states in trade.  The blacksmith had to have money to trade for copper, tin, and iron.  Also, it is to be remembered that Sparta was an Army with a civilization.  So, most good armies tend to be field armies.  So, by Sparta's very nature it had less "stuff" than a like sized Greek town.  At the height of Sparta's power it could only field a little less than 12,000 soldiers.  That's a mere division, not too powerful.  Yes, the Spartans were tough.  But you would not have found all that much money in Sparta because the Spartans would have had little use for it.Sparta is more like an overlords system.  If you were a citizen then you were an overlord, a warrior.  The Perioikoi were the trades people, the workers.  The Helots the slaves.</comment>

<comment>all the classic greek city-states minted coins.  what are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>While that explanation would account for the lack of current barter economies in ethnography, you would have to think that such economies would leave some evidence either in recorded history or archaeologically.</comment>

<comment>While it's not the topic of the article, the scholars interviewed fail to acknowledge the value of money prices as a information transmission mechanism that signals the relative scarcities of resources, enabling them to flow to their highest-valued uses. It's hard to imagine how a gift economy would enable this kind of exchange on a scale any larger than a small group. Very interesting evidence that barter did not really exist in non-monetary societies, though.</comment>

<comment>I think they do not address the value of money as a trading tool in this article, not because they don't recognize that value, but because the article is about the question of how and whether supposed barter economies existed. Money clearly holds some advantages over gift giving alone, and vice-versa.That said, leave it to economists to state something as fact, no disclaimers, and then say that they have no idea if it was true, but that it was a convenient assumption.Economics, the worst of social science, philosophy, and armchair psychology, all rolled into one well-funded, self-justifying discipline.</comment>

<comment>If some form of barter didn't precede money, what did ? If 5 lbs of Wooly Mammoth steaks got you two chickens, how many more chickens could you get with Fred's good will than with Barney's ?Economists tend to make assumptions about things to define models that generate testable hypotheses.  Your cheap shot at economics shows how little you know about it. Pretty good comment until that point though.</comment>

<comment>Folks weren't trading.  The options were gifting or raiding.You either gave up what the other group needed, or risked being attacked/raided.  There was no trade.  Give or defend.The group that could give the most demonstrated they were the strongest...  and therefore didn't get attacked.  It may be a bluff, but remember we're talking about relatively isolated and small groups, likely mostly nomadic, etc...  bluffing is a great way to avoid being attacked.Currency could essentially have evolved simply as an elaborate bluff...  "here, take these 15 twigs...  they represent the 15 cows we can give you tomorrow.  We're strong."  The group that gave the representational twigs, may, or may not, actually have had the cows to back up their "debt"...   but either way, we've now invented representational currency.</comment>

<comment>There was absolutely trade between groups in pre-money societies. This was generally limited to the exhange of rare or luxury resources though and would have been pretty low level.  An example in my neck of the woods is oolichon grease for wool between coastal and interior people in the pacific northwest. It is the presence of a barter economy within groups that is not evident.</comment>

<comment>Except that they don't test those assumptions--rather, they test micro-hypotheses that are built upon the assumptions. Then they write blogs like "freakonomics" in which they marvel over their amazing paradoxes which are not paradoxes at all if you don't buy the initial assumptions.And as for your reply, you are begging the question.There is no set number of chickens precisely because it is not a simple transaction. The number of chickens depends on the relationship between the individuals.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't have to function for anything but a small group.  In 6000 BC, before money...  relatively small groups were all there were.</comment>

<comment>Hell, until the last couple of thousand years small groups were still where the vast majority of humans existed.</comment>

<comment>Well, academics might be living in ivory towers. Barter economies have always existed and understanding them is key to understanding things like inflation/deflation of currencies, measuring true GDP, etc. Bartering is used to escape things like taxation, regulation, use of a bogus "official" currency, and of course, substituting for those who have no currency. Economies in closed systems -- prisons, villages, online virtual worlds -- are good cases to study because they often develop their own de facto currency like cigarettes or even playing cards. In fact, one could go so far as to say that the international currency market itself is really a modern example of a barter system since it has no single nominal unit for trade; national currencies being traded like commodities.</comment>

<comment>They note that barter exists - just that it's people who are aware of money, but for some reason can't use it. For reasons that could include all of your suggestions (though de facto currency is still currency - money hasn't always been a government thing).</comment>

<comment>Have always is a pretty strong statement that you don't really back up. Barter economies certainly exist in situations where people who would otherwise be using money are not able to for whatever reason (as the article mentions). That doesn't say anything about economies in pre-money societies though.</comment>

<comment>Let's do it! And move the "New People" into the country so that they can produce something worth giving.</comment>

<comment>One unmentioned feature of the gift economies of SMALL societies where that Graeber mentions in "Debt: The First Thousand Years" is that barter ALWAYS existed in trade BETWEEN these small societies. Understanding the reason for this clarifies why barter did not exist within small societies: enduring trust between strangers is fraught with conflict. People in small societies or small sub groups of modern societies have ties of enduring trust; long term "payback" can and is respected. In addition, everyday reality reinforces interdependence.By the way, his book is well worth reading. Graeber is in a position to understand this better than many: he himself grew up in a working class community where long term trust is easier to maintain.</comment>

<comment>I would go further and say that in such groups, like churches, payback isn't even part of the equation.  When you put together a meal for the funeral of a parishioner, or make and sell quilts to support the school, it is a gift without strings or expectation of future repayment, many of the quilters, for example, have no children or grandchildren attending the school.</comment>

<comment>Except that the "barter" you claim "in between societies" was not necessarily always how most envision it.  Gift economies don't necessarily have to have "trust"...  they actually can be used as proxy battles in cases of LACK OF TRUST.For example, my understanding is that in "Potlach" gift communities, the incentive in inter-group trade was to try to give MORE than you received in return.  By giving more, you showed your strength/dominance...  if you gave significantly less than the other tribe, you lost face and might be attacked...  because you showed you couldn't produce goods as strongly as the others.I can certainly envision a gift society with no inter-group "bartering"...  they give gifts...  if one side gives weak gifts, they get attacked.  Why barter for something, when the alternative is them gifting it to you or you simply TAKING what you want instead.  In fact, I can further envision how that might lead to the invention of "currency"...  say you're a weak group trying to avoid being attacked...  maybe you give as gifts a bunch of low value "IOUs" to try to hide your weakness....  Some 6000BC Chieftain bluffs by saying "My tribe was unable to move all our cows now, but we give you these 15 twigs to represent the cows we will be giving you - we are strong and have lots of cows to give (whether they actually have them or not)."    Even if the bluff fails, you've now invented the concept of money.And yes, so many folks commenting here complain that gift economies only work at small scale...  but I don't see why that is a hindrance to the main point of the article here.  Prior to the existence of money, humanity did operate at small scales.The invention of money and trade (not necessarily with barter as a pre-requisite) allowed expansion of human communities into larger scales than was possible in the pre-money gift economies.</comment>

<comment>Many societies that used the potlach also engaged in trade with other groups. Oolichan grease and mountain goat wool and horn are examples of common trade goods between the coast and the interior in that part of the world.Potlach also wasn't really trade per se, as you touch on in your post, but an exercise in establishing status as well as a ceremonial, legal (lots of witnesses are important in oral cultures), and information sharing activity.</comment>

<comment>Money is power right.And what is power?Control or hard work?The liberal wants power to be a matter of control.</comment>

<comment>There is actually more than one liberal.</comment>

<comment>Graeber's not a liberal: this is not the argument he makes</comment>

<comment>"Adam Smith said that quid-pro-quo exchange systems preceded economies based on currency, but there’s no evidence that he was right."See Graeber, "Debt: the first 5,000 years." The socio-anthropological record indicates that credit actually came first, followed by coinage/currency, and large scale barter typically happens when economies break down.</comment>

<comment>"...credit actually came first,..."That doesn't make any common sense.How would you enforce that?Just on a skill for skill level, my skill at one thing, yours at another,why would I give you something for a promise?</comment>

<comment>This is actually an observable phenomenon. People use their good names and reputations all the time. Children, women in societies where women don't make money, child care exchanges--Poor people do it all the time. I leave my kids with you while I go to the store, you expect the same of me. If I don't follow through, you tell all my friends and I have less access to human capital in the future.That is what gossip is really all about. People who don't have money most certainly do trade favors. Jumping a car, a cup of flour at 10 p.m., a tip off on a good deal on rent, a nice word to the schoolmaster. In the last WEEK I have given or benefited from those things. And I know that not being seen as a freeloader is crucial to my ability to receive in the future."Better than 100 rubles, have 100 friends" goes the Russian saying. It is true. Provided you can tell the difference between real and counterfeit friends that is!</comment>

<comment>In these types of situations, bringing money into it poisons the relationships - demanding payment or payback is seen as greedy and offering to pay is seen as an insult.</comment>

<comment>Also, it seems that people with more money are more likely to disdain these principles.  "People driving luxury cars are more likely to fail to yield to pedestrians in the crosswalk and to engage in other unethical, antisocial behavior"http://usa.streetsblog.org/201...Not clear whether gaining more wealth makes you a jerk, or being a jerk allows you to gain more wealth.  Other studies have shown there is at least some of the former, and we have all seen plenty of the latter.</comment>

<comment>Heinlein's The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress works this in.  The Loonies are forced to exist in a world where there is no real law nor money.  Reputation for repaying debts is the best wealth a man can have.  If he doesn't pay up, nobody will deal with him.It's a form of social pressure that can be highly effective.But of course RAH's Luna is really a pretty small society.</comment>

<comment>Or you know... You could also go out and have your neighbor over for tacos to see how this mysterious "sharing" works.It is almost comical that academics need to find examples of this in science fiction and Australian tribes.Come on out to the 'burbs. It's pretty much the Stone Age... I hand down my kids' old scooter, you knock on my door and tell me my car's done light is still on. It is like a different world.</comment>

<comment>Read the book. Ancient agrarian societies were overwhelmingly local, people knew each other, and the long lag times between planting and harvest necessitated "credit." Coinage came later, as monarchs began to reach out in the quest for empire and needed a medium of exchange to pay their soldiers.</comment>

<comment>Because you live in a society? because if people don't liv up to their promises nobody does business with them. You should read Graeber's book</comment>

<comment>There was apparently a time in the distant past where one's word actually meant something, and to break it resulted in rather severe negative consequences (that far outweighed any short-term advantage gained by making false promises).</comment>

<comment>The debt that Graeber explains is, what I imagine, a form of social currency, since it exists before money and thus before commodities could be specifically valued. The same argument could be made for a gift economy, and is precisely mentioned in the article as a delayed bartering system. However, the primary point of the article is a rebuke of the quid-pro-quo mentality that modern economics has implied is basic human nature.</comment>

<comment>It helps to look further back at history to understand the basis of human nature. Modern economics, money, religion, nationalism, corporations, etc. are all fiction, homo sapien constructs that allowed us 70,0000 years ago to trust (have thinks in common with) strangers, to form larger groups, to comfortable trade with other clans, etc. For example chimp troops break-up after reaching a population of more than 80.  They can't handle the presence of "strangers" because they lack culture.Going back that far, barter surely came first, coins were developed later.“Large numbers of strangers can cooperate successfully by believing in common myths. Any large-scale human cooperation – whether a modern state, a medieval church, an ancient city or an archaic tribe – is rooted in common myths that exist only in people’s collective imagination.”   ―     Yuval Noah Harari,     Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</comment>

<comment>I believe, and I hope you won't begrudge me, that your response displays an ignorance of human population so long ago. Very likely, as civilization didn't develop until at least 10,000 years ago, nomadic individuals shared resources between them, with no care for value that doesn't comprise the ability to sustain life. Nomadic tribes weren't very populous, nor were there a lot.Likely, if you were a nomad, you wouldn't run into other Nomadic tribes. If you did, I speculate the meetings would often be violent, if, that is, they decided to make contact with each other at all.I do agree, though, that human constructs like civilization help to foster trust in strangers, allowing for development, valuation, etc., when in the right conditions, i.e., right mythology, surplus of goods, etc.</comment>

<comment>We tend to focus on the last 10K years, yet we can gain insights into the timeframe between the "creation" of culture and the traditional 10K years ago focus. I was much affected by the book "Sapiens. Yuval believes the 3 biggest creations in our hominid's culture are religion, money and Empire building.  The first 2 quotes from the Goodreads site:“Consistency is the playground of dull minds.”   ―     Yuval Noah Harari,     Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind“You could never convince a monkey to give you a banana by promising him limitless bananas after death in monkey heaven.”   ―     Yuval Noah Harari,     Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind</comment>

<comment>I'd disagree with those quotations. I should probably read Yuval, and indeed it appears to be tantalizing literature, but barring linguistic barriers and ignoring psychological studies that say stability and consistency foster a healthy and sharp mind, I believe there are some interesting points to explore.Primarily, we do not know what a monkey is thinking. Therefore, we can't rule out that it doesn't believe there exists something supernatural. Further, considering that neanderthals, dated upwards of 200,000 years ago, practiced burial rituals, I conclude that religion isn't a home sapien construct. Most likely, it developed in parallel with consciousness. Look into neurotheology; it's rather interesting.Finally, I don't necessarily believe there is such a thing as the creation of culture. Defining such a time is quite difficult, and is unaided by the lack of virtually anything that relates to nomadic culture.</comment>

<comment>So money is so evil that you need to consider a gift economy as the possible alternative?  Maybe we should have a system like the aborigine one described here where exchanges required a big feast with dancing and lots of sex.  That sounds like a lot of fun but I can't imagine being able to have cars, iPhones, and a heated plumbed house under such a system.Maybe a money based economy is a pretty good idea after all.  </comment>

<comment>Redistribution is not the same as a gift.</comment>

<comment>Money is still the root of all evil.</comment>

<comment>Gift economies sound pretty nice in some ways, but it's hard to ask of people that they backpedal the standard of living to which they're accustomed - and that's basically a cut-and-dried requirement of living mostly or fully in a gift/community-exchange economy. Want something processed, mass-produced, or imported? Yeah, you're probably out of luck, sorry. Get used to making do with what you and your community can collectively access through gifts and informal bargaining.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. The other issue is you want to keep that gift economy in your community. Extending the goods you've made to outsiders is a mistake. And, by extension, getting their goods becomes impossible.</comment>

<comment>Money is ANY medium of trade, that is why after a Nuclear War Gold and silver would be great. Everybody agrees it's rare, and in proper form, not easily counterfeited. So a trade can still take place without worthless old republic cash.</comment>

<comment>That medium has to have perceived value though.  Post nuclear war, gold and silver may be totally worthless....  they aren't terribly useful metals.  Pretty and rare, but without a functioning system of specialization and trade, not very valuable for a subsistence person.</comment>

<comment>Hi.  This is the diamond-water paradox knocking.</comment>

<comment>One of the problems with people who try 'modern' barter clubs, is they are filled with SERVICE people, with VERY few HARD goods people.Getting all your services for 'free' is nice but when you sell hard goods your suppliers are ONLY taking real money.</comment>

<comment>That's at least partly because the hard goods sellers had to spend actual money to purchase the goods themselves.I joined a couple of barter clubs over the years, and they worked exactly as you say.  I was one of the many service providers.  A few hard goods sellers were willing to participate, but only to the extent they could use the points to finance services they'd otherwise have to pay for with cash.At its best, every single member would turn down a barter job if he could get one for money instead. Including me.</comment>

<comment>No mention of raiding? For goods or women?I imagine the threat of a raid would hang over "trade events" like the Australian "sex with the wives"  party.     The husband might not really want tobacco for the chance to raise some stranger's kid- but if the alternative was tribal warfare and having his wife stolen away- well- it might make that tobacco taste better.</comment>

<comment>EXACTLY.   Gift economies don't require trust...  in some cases, gift economies are proxies battles for groups with LACK OF TRUST.</comment>

<comment>The IRS would be all over this- just like they are all over doctors who try to swap services.</comment>

<comment>I find the demon cratius story quite convincing. This is where you have slaves in egypt and they are told they are now free and can earn money in exchange for a palace in town etc. This part of the story is the key to it where it reveals the greed part and the city connection. Chapter 6 www.rivendellvillage.org/Book_... I find it hard to believe that a free people living in their gardens could fall for this but a slave people already psycologically damaged could easily see freedom in money. There are examples of slave islands such as sugarcane plantations where it was found that money was more efficient than the cost of paying guards to prevent against a revolt. There is so much effort to promote the city in the media and it is so blatent when you know what you are looking for so in the imagery the green selling point  has the ability to completely change the way money flows. A good example of some city/ car selling videos are boy friend Justin Bieber https://www.youtube.com/watch?... and this one too https://www.youtube.com/watch?... it ends with the city backdrop and there is the violent father associated with the garden. Seems too much to be any accident to this. This boss advert even has the dude sort of looking away from the tree and ends with the city backdrop aswell very disturbing video to me.. https://www.youtube.com/watch?...

<comment>Does he write in all caps? Because I find that tiresome and off-putting</comment>

<comment>Yes the whole point of the "barter myth" is to naturalize money and to make a specific kind of monetary exchange seem natural and inevitable. The fact that the barter model has never appeared, anywhere, either in history or n the present, does not stop economists from using it as their theoretical foundation.I've taught this, and for libertarians especially this is simply un-hearable. But gold standard! Natural!</comment>

<comment>The Rainbow Gathering is an especially poor example of a free economy, since it costs the taxpayers via the US Forest Service up to $500,000 to police and clean up after they have departed on their star-strewn paths. De-monetize that.</comment>

<comment>They do a pretty good job cleaning up after themselves. If there is ever any genuine need for police support then I am sure they have paid for it many times over in taxes but terrorizing the kids isn't good. https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Rainbow gathering makes a giant mess.  Claiming otherwise is ridiculous.BUT, the experience has been its better to let them do their thing in a permitted and controlled way, that to have them just do it organically.  Suddenly they are camping on top of a field of endangered plants, etc. etc.  That is when the mess really gets out of hand.So the taxpayers are getting the shaft either way (or, from another standpoint...  maybe this is what public lands are for).  But the taxpayers (as represented by the USFS) are also making practical decisions about whether it is better to let them cause $500k in costs, or whether let them do $1m+ in damages by telling them no.</comment>

<comment>Not the case clean up is done.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...The cost is to these people who are denied permanent land where they could live and travel between their gatherings. The visitors gain from their experience and the rainbow gathering contributes much healing to the society. There is some good songs. https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Huh?  Who is denying them permanent land?  Hint: There is a real-estate section is in basically every newspaper, craigslist, etc.  If they want a permanent place, no one but themselves is stopping them.I'm not totally against the Rainbow Gathering... like I said, there is a strong case that our public lands are FOR exactly these types of events, and no one has claimed they don't try to clean up after themselves (though recent years, when forced by their permit requirements, are likely better than a early less controlled events historically).  BUT, you can't put that many people in one spot for that amount of time, and NOT get resource damage.  I don't care how well they try to clean up after themselves...  the laws of physics and ecology simply mean there will be damage.  The receipts/costs incurred by the USFS to monitor and cleanup afterwards are real costs to the taxpayers...  and yes, I believe I've heard that those run ~$500k per event.</comment>

<comment>Sure some of them might buy land once half their lives have gone by homeless in student apartments, woofing, backpacker hostels and so on. Others might not make it. That is your loss not some made up figures by people who seek to take away also a short gathering to connect with nature.https://www.youtube.com/watch?... I have been to 2 the smaller one was definately the better it was only 70 people Italian gathering. I read somewhere that they had to send in a chopper after I left coz someone ate some mushrooms that were not edible but it was quite something the way the mayor came over the mountain from the nearest village with his garments and they do all of this. There is all sorts you know people complained about the noise when it was definately well out of ear shot. In the bigger gathering they had so much money they bought cut logs I think it was like 10,000 euros worth that went up on the full moon. The food was pretty good at that one but there is some undercurrents. The workshops can be quite good but it was on festival land so it was kind of rubbish from a nature perspective the one in Italy was magic with the waterfalls and the flowers and everything still there was some light pollution coming over the mountains. The Hungarian gathering I ended up in a camp withn Russians  which could be a bit unnerving at times in the dark by the fire but it was cool Russians and Americans and Brits rainbow style. </comment>

<comment>replied already.</comment>

<comment>The gift economy works because their are specialists who go about receiving specific gifts in exchange for other specific gifts and then give those specific gifts to another party who gifts them the gifts that the party who provided the first gifts want to receive as gifts.In other words traders.  Every economy anthropologists have seen has these specialists, and they are the precursor to money, and guess what they are practicing barter.You can call it a gift economy but nobody would keep doing it if they weren't benefitting.   It is always barter, if one party abuses it, the other party won't trade next time or will provide only token gifts until the abusing party makes restitution.If You think otherwise you should read more anthropology, and more history.  International trade used to be conducted in this matter with the Pharoah presenting gifts of gold, papyri, faience, etc... to the kings in Ugarit in exchange for timber, etc...Heck until the opium wars this was the only official and legal way to trade with China.</comment>

<comment>Not for small societies with a maximum local population of 1000. People living in small  societies with minimal division of labor (male/female, shaman) are highly cooperative because everyone understands that only cooperation for well defined tasks (hunting, gathering, shelter) insures their survival. "Efficient"? Of course it is. There is simply no need to  formally define the rights and duties of each individual.We spend billions on our legal system because it's impossible to rely on a purely informal system to governs behavior.

<comment>Chinese international trade worked this way for 2000 years.  Foreign states sent "tribute" to the Emperor, who graciously gifted them with "presents" in return.This continued even during periods of conflict or war.  The relative value of "tribute" vs. "gifts" was always watched with an eagle eye by both sides.  When the steppe tribes to the north got more powerful, their tribute decreased and the value of the gifts to them increased. The reverse happened during periods of Chinese dominance.</comment>

<comment>One crucial thing this article ignores is that the division of labor was facilitated by money.Money is really just a common medium of exchange.Delayed bartering is still bartering.  Furthermore the intertribal trades which are spoken of in the article are examples of bartering</comment>

<comment>It's not a "gift" if you're expecting something in return.  It's delayed bartering.</comment>

<comment>Right, that's what I said</comment>

<comment>Others here seem to miss that point. How they can grossly misuse the word "gift" is perplexing.  I guess they'll latch on to any alternate theory that can undermine Adam Smith and therefore capitalism, even if they create a "gift" theory that is actually delayed bartering.</comment>

<comment>Delayed bartering is not gifting. If you consider a tree offers gifts like fruit, oxygen and the soothing green colour that relaxes people. That we give the gift of carbon dioxide to the tree when we breath is not a cost and not dependent on a requirement for an exchange. If the trees were looking at the way they were treated and using money to agree an exchange they would have long ago said no to people but they give the gifts anyway and are very much appreciated by tree huggers but not so much by naturephobes.</comment>

<comment>You do know that the fruit trees provide us also contain the tree's seeds that we then distribute for the tree when we eat the fruit and discard the seeds, right? That's not being totally altruistic and selfless. LOL.</comment>

<comment>I do know that fruits contain seeds yes but people have made seedless varieties and so they are not fruits since fruits contain seeds and seeds are viable. You will know them by their fruits. As for being altruistic how to you expect do get more fruits if there was no seeds in them? The seed is the biggest gift of all gifted in abundance.</comment>

<comment>Those seedless varieties weren't created naturally, they were produced by human intervention.</comment>

<comment>Trees aren't capable of gifts because they don't have the intellect (or an intellect) to form intent.  You and I don't intentionally exhale CO2. We have no choice in the matter.  What you've described could be called many things--serendipity, God's plan, a happy accident--but not gift giving.</comment>

<comment>You probably don't intentionally make humanure to feed trees instead preferring to kill fish and create algal blooms in the ocean. The hunzakut who have no crime and live longer do however use humanure. http://www.alongerhealthylife....</comment>

<comment>Money is still bartering, by your definition</comment>

<comment>That's the point.  The "myth" of the barter system isn't a myth, despite the article's premise.</comment>

<comment>IT'S LIKE TEN DIFFERENT THEORIES THAT MIGHT HAVE EXISTED ALL SMOOSHED TOGETHER TO FORM A SORT OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC AGENDA BLOGTICAL! AMAZING!Oh my goodness! This passes for journalism these days? The insinuations on the black community, which I fully expected were coming after the third paragraph, surprised me less than "The Village is in modern 'Murica!" The implications are reckless ("we want to re-enslave blacks with our currency! HA!")Oh my God. Oh my God. What the hell is happening here? What happened to The Atlantic?</comment>

<comment>"Even after taking income into account, debt collection suits are twice as common in black neighborhoods as in white ones."A truly peculiar metric.  Wouldn't it make more sense to control for amount of debt, or perhaps failure to make payments?</comment>

<comment>And all because Adam Smith believed in the barter system.  Fucking dead white males.Seriously, how you start off with a premise of the barter system was a myth and leap to debt collection being unfair towards certain minorities is a dazzling display of logic.</comment>

<comment>Sorry these scenarios just sound like different forms of bartering. I'm sure throughout history all trades weren't made on the spot.Anyways it's like God. Just because you can't prove his existence, doesn't mean he's not real.Personally, i think evidence of God and Hell are around us every day.</comment>

<comment>What a ridiculous piece. There is no separation in principle between bartering and money. It's just trade. Yes, at some point in human history, when we were closer to apes than people, there likely was no trade, at least no trade in an economic sense. But then...at some point, there was.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  The point is, what came BEFORE representational money.  It likely wasn't barter.Likely some sort of gift economy.  Power based on status and ability to provide "gifts" (food, protection, sex, etc.), not based on one's ability to "buy" goods off others.If you couldn't/wouldn't provide a gift, the more likely outcome would be you would be attacked, not that someone would try to barter it out of you.</comment>

<comment>So before money there was essentially a form of Communism across all societies in the world. Interesting. Makes a bit of sense. In small scale social groups money isn't really needed.</comment>

<comment>While the argument for the historical false narrative is well thought out, the reality is that our current incarnation of currency is also flawed to the point of eventual non-sustainability.  As soon as we became a credit-based monetary culture, the issues were magnified.  The time to revise and improve the existing model is now, or we will be forced to alter it due to unfavorable data.</comment>

<comment>So how much bitcoin do you own?</comment>

<comment>Your confirmation bias is showing.</comment>

<comment>According to the article, humans have pretty much always been a credit-based culture.  Money is just another good, like lima beans or tractors.  Calling something "monetary" doesn't change the credit-based nature of the economy.</comment>

<comment>Compared to historic examples, today's  problem is the volume, and the fact that large scale markets are now controlled by computer algorithm formulas.  Add to that the empirically supported assertion that the current macro-economic models overwhelmingly favor a small percentage of the population.</comment>

<comment>you need to consider the difference between credit--which predates money--and money, which is invented partly out of the idea of escaing or repressing the gift economy</comment>

<comment>We were ALWASY a credit based culture--that's the point of the gift economy. You are always getting credit for acts performed now, in the form of expectations for future acts</comment>

<comment>Perhaps a look at the anthropological concept of "reciprocity" will help us better understand where "barter" fits in the spectrum of ways humans transfer goods and services within their communities. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... )"Barter" is a form of market exchange. The presence or absence of money doesn't have much effect on the nature of this exchange which is based on "value" attributed by each partner. Money is simply a way of measuring and storing value so that exchanges can be accounted for over time. Non-money societies use social status and obligation as the medium exchange. Westerners tend to lump all non-monetary transactions under the term, "gifts".The altruistic or non-exchange gift is only one extreme form of "Gifting", a process that occurs in all societies and is embedded in a complex web of social obligations.I think we are seeing a lot of comments about this article because, as a society, we are experiencing a break-down of our market-only system of wealth transfer. Unfortunately most of us are unfamiliar with the myriad of alternate ways human communities have devised to redistribute their products and labor. No economic system is purely market, money or gift based. That said, we might find useful instruction in bring some of the conventions used by traditional peoples into our modern communities.</comment>

<comment>We don't have a market-only system.  We have federal, state, and local government, all of whom tax us, then use those taxes for various things, including providing services for those who are at lower socio-economic levels.  (Whether or not those services is adequate is a separate matter.)</comment>

<comment>Amplification accepted. Perhaps it would be more accurate to say we are likely to interpret even redistribution mechanisms such as taxation in market-exchange terms. Those who argue against governmental welfare payments cite monetary benefit to society or labor contribution as necessary reciprocations. They minimize social obligation to provide support independently from exchange. In other words, they value production over persons.</comment>

<comment>So some people wish we had a pure market economy.  They are on the fringe and always will be, just like those who wish the US were some giant kibbutz.</comment>

<comment>Re: "myriad of alternate ways human communities have devised ways to redistribute their products and labor". "myriad"? That is probably quite an exaggeration. There has to be an upper limit because only small societies - like perhaps a maximum of 1000 people - could maintain such a system, primarily because it requires a high level of trust that both parties need to have confidence that the "debt" will be repaid eventually, not immediately.It's clear that Graeber wants a revolution that will get adopt this form of exchange. I think we could adopt more of it, but our society is far to complex, large and, mobile. The latter can quickly destroy any informal systems of exchange when members of local systems when the necessity to exit local groups in search of employment is always a present.</comment>

<comment>There are more reasons for a monetary system than just providing an easier and more convenient medium of exchange. I've encountered people who have given what they called 'gifts' to me, and then expected me to reciprocate with specific 'gifts' from me to them in return, specific 'gifts' that I didn't want to give them. When I told them that I thought that what they had given me was a gift and therefore didn't require me to reciprocate with a gift back to them much less the specific gift that they were wanting, they got very hostile toward me and spread stories about how horrible a person I was until I became an outcast among our friends and acquaintances.I have found this to be a very insidious form of gift giving, or barter if you will, and I've learned to be very wary of such people giving me gifts. Better just to agree to exchange money for goods and services. That way nobody can demand that I give them something that I don't want to give them just because they gave me what they called a 'gift'.</comment>

<comment>I'm sympathetic with the situation you describe. In the "developed world" we are acclimated to a) the non-exchange (altruist) gifts, b) anonymity in economic exchange, c) rule of explicit law rather than complex, implicit web of traditional social obligations. Spreading stories to effect social outcasting is how these social expectations are enforced. Compare that with our legal use of violence and imprisonment for enforcement. There are arguments in favor and against all of these cultural institutions. However, we are often most comfortable with whatever system we grew up with and tend to view incompatible ways as "hostile".My concern is that our current economic system is supporting both a concentration of wealth within a small number of people and a shrinking capacity for the masses to acquire the fruits of our communal productivity. I wonder if we might improve this situation by exploring other ways humans have found to solve this problem. Such ways will appear alien, even ridiculous, to us at first encounter. A closer look at traditional patterns of gifting and social obligation could yield evolving a more effective economic process for our overcrowded and highly automated world.</comment>

<comment>I think that no matter what economic system you set up, there will be some people who will seek ways to game it for their own personal profit.The people I have dealt with as I described before also liked to offer gifts and then become hostile if I turned down their gifts, no matter how politely, claiming that they were being insulted. When I tried to offer them a gift of my own choosing instead of the gift that they wanted, they claimed that the gift I was offering them was of lesser value than the gift that they were offering me and therefore was also an insult. Apparently only the gift that they wanted would do. Clever way to game a gifting or bartering system based on social obligations to acquire whatever they want.The high degree of income and wealth inequality that we are experiencing now in the west I believe is the result of several factors that have developed in concert over the past few decades. There is ever improving technological advancement that has brought automation replacing ever more human labor, outsourcing of manufacturing to non-western countries where the labor and environmental laws haven't kept up thus allowing companies to take advantage of very low wage practically slave labor and a lack of environmental protection from industrial wastes, and housewives joining men in the labor market increasing the labor force participation rate and thereby increasing competition for jobs while jobs are declining due to the previous two factors.Then there are the tax laws favoring the wealthy like the lower tax rates for long term capital gains and qualified dividends. According to Picketty in his book 'Capital in the Twenty First Century', as you go further up the wealth scale, you will find that the people there derive more of their income from their investments and less from their labor. Therefore the higher on the wealth scale you are, the more your income is derived from your stock investments and the more you therefore benefit from the lower tax rates on stock investments. Also FICA tax is only applied to earned income, not investments or savings income, saving the wealthy even more in taxes. It's not surprising that Warren Buffett pays a significantly lower percentage of his income in Fed income taxes than his secretary who makes a fraction of what he does.I don't think that reverting to a barter economy will even address much less solve these issues.When the wealth and income inequality was this extreme just before the Great Depression, what I've heard finally brought us out of it and made wealth more equal was WWII. It put a lot of formerly unemployed people to work and the wealthy were taxed at an exorbitantly high rate to pay for it. Of course it was a crisis situation and a calamitous disaster that no one in their right mind would wish to repeat. But apparently it takes such a crisis situation to finally motivate people to get out of their present course and set a new one that could potentially bring about more wealth and income equality.I'd like to see a new space race to establish colonies on the Moon and Mars myself. When the Russians launched Sputnik in the late 50's, it caused a crisis in the west and lit a fire under our arse and got us moving in the first space race. That spurred economic development nicely back then. But unfortunately it didn't last. Once we had beaten them to the Moon, nobody cared that much anymore and we've languished in low Earth orbit ever since. Maybe if the Chinese decide to launch an expedition to Mars...;-)</comment>

<comment>If, as I claim, barter is a variation on market exchange and not a serious departure from our current system, do we need to expand the other forms of reciprocity in modern culture?</comment>

<comment>Interesting, but isn't "making transactions between different tribes or groups" easier that money, in the form of scarce metals, was used in the first place? With gold and or silver, most everyone wanted them, and would trade whatever they had to obtain it. Gold has the added advantage of not corroding, so would be preferred.I also think ancient Lydia was in Turkey, not Syria.</comment>

<comment>Everybody wants food too, and water: everybody wants lots of things. Gold would be easier with someone who was just passing through, but why bother with gold when you have a local gift economy? In fact for large parts of the us., historically, money was rarely used</comment>

<comment>That was so when most of the economy was in self-sufficient farms, or hunter-gatherer groups, but that wasn't true after the Industrial Revolution got going. City dwellers cannot get by without things manufactured further from where they would be used in a barter economy. Money was needed. The money shortages imposed by the Crown were a major part of the grievances leading to US Revolution.We just might find out for ourselves if the Stock Market crashes and the paper money suddenly becomes worthless, as will happen when the $trillions of QE-1,QE-2, etc finally get out into the economy.</comment>

<comment>Yes that's part of the point: money is not natural: it doesn't grow out of some inherent problem with barter any more than steam tractors are natural</comment>

<comment>Man's ability to build tools and machines is a part of nature.  Your assertion otherwise is nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Food is perishable, water in significant quantity of value is too heavy to transport cheaply to make good money.Trade is all BS aside far more economically efficient than a gift economy.   It is too easy to "cheat" in a gift economy by taking much more than you give.A trade economy is self-correcting on that issue.  </comment>

<comment>The Myth of the Better Economy by Barack Obama.</comment>

<comment>I think most of the commenters here are missing one of the bigger implications of Strauss's article.  A key component of the intellectual foundations of a critically important academic discipline that is seen as "scientific" simply does not exist.  If Adam Smith so seriously bungled the "barter economy" issue, what other parts of economic theory are on equally shaky ground?</comment>

<comment>Trust me, I don't think anyone missed it.  And that is definitely the point of this article and Smith's detractors, but at the end of the day whether or not Adam Smith was right about the barter system is irrelevant.  The importance of Smith's work is the description of modern market economies that use currency, not the hypothetical barter system. The market economy theories stand on their own.</comment>

<comment>Don't think economies is the right word. It is more of an anti-economy when you have things being designed intentionally to brake. https://www.youtube.com/watch?...

Better sell it while you can. https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>"what other parts of economic theory are on equally shaky ground?"All of them, since "Economics" is not a science.</comment>

<comment>Well, economics is complete BS. They don't consider the environment, resource depletion, pollution, social cohesion, or any other "externality" in modern economics. But of course these "externals" are the things that really matter. Economics can't say anything about these however because the models they use can't model the real world. Therefore all that economics does is model a fake construct that only exists on paper. Not very useful. </comment>

<comment>Why would anyone assume that Adam Smith was accurate that barter economies existed before currency-based economies? He was a political philosopher, not a historian.This article's genesis baffles me somewhat. Adam Smith's thought experiment extended his own notions of value creation back to pre-currency societies. This is very clear to anyone who has read Wealth of Nations. Marcel Mauss, briefly mentioned, would make a far better position to write this article from. The Gift is a classic of anthropological literature.If you want to contrast the idea of exchange based economies with ones based on "the gift," and write a journalistic article about it, then it might be best to base the ideas in history, rather than economics. Nobody outside of economics textbooks is surprised by this revelation.</comment>

<comment>The gifting culture sounds a lot like what I've heard about Alaskan native culture.</comment>

<comment>Work it, work it! http://www.theguardian.com/com...</comment>

<comment>That was utterly stupid since barter was part and parcel of using currency and they go back as far as the Germans using their Esterling while someone else traded a donkey for a horse.</comment>

<comment>*sigh* Typical BS article. Delayed bartering is bartering. But the author WANTS to say that barter didn't exist and so they call it "delayed barter" and then claim this isn't bartering at all. Wow.</comment>

<comment>I get a kick out of all of the hilariously-detailed speculation by commenters about how they feel (or project, rather) hypothetical exchanges between individuals (or cultures) in the distant past would have gone, even to the point of including sample transcripts of what they would say (using made-up quotes, obviously).</comment>

<comment>yes, let's explore societies without a medium of exchange and see if they are a better alternative.   why do we need perhaps  what was originally the most noble institution in the history of humanity?</comment>

<comment>right.</comment>

<comment>Shaman?</comment>

<comment>Present day technologies, and those emerging from labs around the world, will enable a gift economy (as some call it) later in this century. Money is a means of allocating scarcity, like economics and present-day "isms". All will fade in importance as scarcity is replaced by sustainable abundance. I describe how this might happen in A Celebration Society.</comment>

<comment>Scarcity is a product of anti-economics supply and demand right so they reduce supply to increase profits particularly with housing and most particularly with gardens (increase demand as well for example if there is a second story it is dangerous to fix the roof yourself and if there is another building blocking the sun you force heating demand up and ofcourse demand for work if there is a large mortgage = demand for transport etc.) Farming is astonishingly inefficient. It is not technology that is needed but land. " I recently came across this article by David Blume chronicling his nine-year permaculture enterprise in California. Running a CSA for 300-450 people on two acres of land, he achieved yields eight times what the Department of Agriculture says is possible per square foot." http://charleseisenstein.net/p...</comment>

<comment>Well, I partially agree with you.  Permaculture techniques can evidently be used to convert desert that was once lush back to abundance. Aquaponics and other advanced systems using technology can tremendously increase the food produced in a given acreage.Land is a lot more available than most presume. About 90% of Earth's population lives on 10% of its land.  But that's just the start.In this century, we can plan to build floating oceanic city-states that actually serve as coral reefs and homes to many fish and other organisms. Beyond that, the O'Neill space colonies beckon; an effectively unlimited source of new "land". (And with a far better quality of life than most of us experience here on Earth.)All of this can be done is a way that respects fragile ecosystems, without coercion and either by private groups or via public-private partnerships.The Department of Agriculture, like all of us, uses assumptions in its analyses. If those assumptions are flawed, so will be the conclusions.</comment>

<comment>Land is plentiful but there needs to be a plan like you can buy some land and be totally isolated with few available women in the area. Then you have to go into farming coz the land is too big to manage without machinery. This is why you will see a lot of older couples go into permaculture but the younger ones stay in the city to meet people. If you had land rights like 1 hectare then you have a concentration of people like any advantage a city could offer but with all the advantages of good neighbours, community and an economy. This needs some sort of planning I can show you legislation even if your going to pay for the land some amount there still needs to be protection of land rights and facilitation so nobodies saying you can't live there some sort of environmental rules to protect the land and water it is not exactly difficult . http://translate.google.com/tr...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>This is far too involved a discussion to have here. I invite you to read my book, in which these issues are discussed in depth with mainstream citations. (It's free if you can't afford it.) Then I'd be glad to revisit this with you.</comment>

<comment>Not sure mainstream citations are a selling point. Wouldn't leading edge citations be better? I do hope you recognise that robotics is not a priority. People talk about green electricity  when they haven't got a handle on the much more important energy source of food. All roads lead to paradise though as they say.</comment>

<comment>Judge for yourself. Why not read a few pages and then tell me what you think?</comment>

<comment>To me, the most important part of the article is buried toward the end:"Graeber asserts that the barter myth implies humans have always had a sort of quid pro quo, exchange-based mentality, since barter is just a less efficient version of money. But if you consider that other, completely different systems existed, then money starts to look like less of a natural outgrowth of human nature, and more of a choice."</comment>

<comment>Bingo. All must praise the cashless society as if our money isn't worthless enough already.</comment>

<comment>The author is completely wrong because he ignores half the economy. The economy is not just goods. It is goods AND services. The bartering of services is HUGE. As a retired single adult I live with my parents and help take care of them. It is a barter transaction worth thousands per month, since rent is easily >$1000 per month here and labor is likewise expensive. The same would be true of people who carpool, loan tools, and thousands of other bartering situations. When you had a tribe of native Americans where some hunted while others gathered roots and berries while others cooked and cleaned, you had a barter economy with very little trading. Before the white man came and introduced horses, it was advantageous to own little, since moving  meant carrying everything on your back. Money allows larger civilizations to be built. But, when you have a society of 2 -20 individuals, most, if not all, transactions are barter. The advantage of larger civilizations is protection, just ask the Native Americans.</comment>

<comment>Barter has existed since Og saw Grog needed help dragging that chunk of wooly mammoth and/or cavewoman back to Grog's cave. Since Grog couldn't eat all the meat and was possibly done with the cavewoman, Og was surely invited to share in the spoils. To suggest this type of situation didn't exist is foolhardy at best and dishonest at worst.To this day we see people trade things of value continuously until they are happy with their 'final' choice of what to keep for themselves and stop trading.</comment>

<comment>In Bolivia there existed and still exists the ayni system with ayni markets that function solely on barter.  A cloth for potatoes, hardware for onions...</comment>

<comment>Anyone interested in this should read any of the works of Karl Polanyi, especially his "The Great Transformation" published back in 1944.There has never been a barter economy. "Barter economies" are the mythology of market economies.</comment>

<comment>I have a lot on my plate right now but thanks </comment>

<comment>There's no mythical past where all peoples were the same and lived the same way.</comment>

<comment>This  article was a complete waste of time. Before money (currency) there was gold (or other precious metals). Before that, pearls, fish, salt etc.  Before that, what ever. Duh!   PS, Have any of Atlantic's writers graduated from college?</comment>

<comment>well, we did used to trade stuff at dead shows </comment>

<comment>I think the author and many posters do not grasp that we humans had large scale trade many thosands of years before the invention of writing.Evidence of this is the broad distibution of Clovis stone spear heads broadly over North America where data from analysis of the stones show they originated at only a few specific locations.   Trade in other high value items over broad areas in pre-history has been documented.Our historical record starts with the invention of writing. With absolute certainty I can say money predates writing (money in the form of a standardized trade good, live cattle on the hoof was an early denominator of money).  In fact keeping track of money and commercial transactions & contracts is one reason writing was invented.That money is quite old, does not prove money predates barter.   The assertion that money predates barter is just not provable.  I acknowledge that it is a legitimate theory, but neither side of this argument is provable.We know that the ancient phoenicians had a technique for barter auctions that did not require parties to know each other's language.  Who is to say this might not predate writing & money by thousands of years.</comment>
