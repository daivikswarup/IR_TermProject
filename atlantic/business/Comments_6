<comment>That was a nice job of setting up and then taking down the specious arguments against the estate tax.  I agree, it's somewhat dumbfounding that so many don't see the prudence, benefits, and viability of properly restricting obscene transfers of wealth.</comment>

<comment>Heil MZale!!</comment>

<comment>Aww, aren't you sweet.</comment>

<comment>"obscene" typically defined as "50% more than I have"</comment>

<comment>Mostly, I see the obscenity in the aggregate value of the transfers.  Personally, I think the floor of $5 million, after certain exemptions, is fine.  I'd add a 90% surrender of all wealth over, say, $100 million though.  Encouraging donation and spending will be beneficial to the overall economy.</comment>

<comment>The greatest problem with Estate Tax is that it does not adjust for regional differences in cost of living, property values and incomes that unfairly hits people in the Northeast and West Coast.If the Estate Tax adjusted regionally and taxed at a more reasonable rate (like 20% instead of 55%), I would support it but as it stands, I cannot.</comment>

<comment>I'd find it so hard to live on $5 million in California.  I'd only be able to afford ten houses.</comment>

<comment>Well, only two or three in LA or San Francisco!</comment>

<comment>Median price in LA is only 629k.  Besides, it's a $5 million estate, so work wouldn't a justification for living in a high cost area....</comment>

<comment>You miss the point if you think you get $5 million.A small family business that's been around for a while can do that just from real estate appreciation, which means when the owner dies, the family is forced to sell the family business to pay the taxes.</comment>

<comment>Oh, only about $4.9 million then? (The average effective rate for a $5-$10 million estate is about 8%)Here's the key fact for you:"The effective rate is so much lower than the top rate for several reasons.  First, estate taxes are due only on the portion of an estateâ€™s value that exceeds the exemption level; at the 2015 exemption level of $5.43 million, a $6 million estate would owe estate taxes on $570,000 at most."http://www.cbpp.org/research/t...</comment>

<comment>And when a small family company doesn't have it?They are forced to sell.There should be regional adjustments based on cost of living, real estate prices and average incomes.The people in states with lousy real estate values and incomes should have the same burden as those from successful states when many of these things being calculated are anything but liquid.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't have what? The money to pay estate taxes?Do the necessary planning. Form an LLC, or any other number of options.And I'd be fine with a reasonable adjustment based on areas of the country (e.g., it be 2x larger in NYC or San Fran). But that's not what Republicans are arguing -- they want it *all* to go away.</comment>

<comment>So you think it is ok to use loopholes to avoid paying estate taxes, but if a sole proprietorship doesn't try to avoid taxes, it's ok to hit them all the way.IF we are going to have a working estate tax, the loopholes have to go too.  It just has to be a fair and equitable tax.</comment>

<comment>Wait -- weren't you just arguing for different rates for different areas of the country (which again, I'm fine with)? That would be a "loophole" according to some.But OK, get rid of the loopholes -- that's OK by me. See who you can get to agree to what loopholes are "fair" and "unfair". An attempt at "fairness" is what has created many of the loopholes in the first place.</comment>

<comment>... in other words, people are to start from the ground zero, just on the good education? What an un-american idea!</comment>

<comment>Since when is it American to shutdown small family businesses?</comment>

<comment>If they are not effective enough - since about the inception of US as a country.</comment>

<comment>Wait, why are you assuming they aren't profitable?</comment>

<comment>If a small business isn't capable of securing a loan to get through taxation - it's not at all profitable. 5 million is not out of the ordinary for small businesses.</comment>

<comment>As someone new to New York, it is always pretty galling when people act as though people here are just stuck having higher incomes and living costs relative to the rest of the country.  Nothing personal, I just hear this argument a lot.I earn about half again as much here as I did back home, doing the same job.  My cost of living is also about half again as high, and my taxes are also higher (not even counting the fact that I now pay city taxes in addition to state and federal.)The only way this is "unfair" is if I'm not receiving anything of value in exchange for my higher living costs.  Except that's not the case: I'm now living in New York, which I obviously value on some level, otherwise I'd be living somewhere else.  If people here want to pay less in taxes, they're always free to move to Florida and earn less money.  They don't do this, because they'd rather live in New York.If I decide to change my life so that I'm earning more money and can buy a luxury car, then even though I might not be financially ahead after payments, I'm still driving a nicer car.  Granted, if I grew up driving luxury cars, I might view them as a baseline, but that doesn't mean people driving Chevys are going to have much patience with my complaints about the high costs of Maserati ownership.</comment>

<comment>You're using ratios to discuss the value/income regional differences.  Why would an estate tax not use a ratio instead of flat numbers too?Even when you discuss the matter you realize it is a matter of proportions.  Shouldn't taxes be the same?</comment>

<comment>You're using ratios to discuss the value/income regional differences.  Why would an estate tax not use a ratio instead of flat numbers too?Oh man, if you think people hate the IRS now, wait until they can't even predict their tax burden until annual or biennial COL figures come out for their ZIP code.  Also, whose ZIP code?  The decedent or the inheritor?  And why should the estate tax structure encourage people to move to higher-cost areas of the country if they're about to give or receive an inheritance?  If you tell me I'll inherit five million if I live in Tampa, but 6.5 million if I live in the NY metro area with an ailing relative's imminent passing, then I'm moving ASAP despite any cost or inconvenience.Even when you discuss the matter you realize it is a matter of proportions.  Shouldn't taxes be the same?Why?  If one person is earning 50K in FL while another with the same job is earning 75K in New York, the latter person's decision to spend that money differently (in this case, on COL) doesn't mean that they're receiving any less income.  It seems like you're suggesting that choosing to live in a more expensive area should be a tax-deductible form of consumer spending.By the way, we already do give people in higher COL areas a break, especially if they own homes.  Take two people, one in NY and one in FL, both earning 100K and both owning a condo that's in the low end of market value for their area, purchased at the same time.  The condo in FL is financed for 150K, while the condo in NY is financed for 500K.  The taxpayer in NY has a much bigger mortgage interest deduction than the taxpayer in FL.  They also, unless they take the standard exemption, are more likely to have a higher writeoff due to deductible expenses.  (FL isn't a great example of this, since the healthcare costs tend to be similar to NY, but I'm just using these states as proxies for low-cost/high-cost states.)</comment>

<comment>So no problem with disproportionate burdens because you can't imagine the paperwork...That's a good reason.</comment>

<comment>So no problem with disproportionate burdens because you can't imagine the paperwork...No, it's because I disagree with your premise that a person's choice to spend more of their income on living in an expensive area reflects the imposition of a disproportionate burden.  I feel this was addressed in more detail in the other two paragraphs of my post.My point about administrative difficulties was not a reason to maintain the current system of taxing evenly across the country, but an issue that would occur if you tried to alter taxation in the way you suggested.  It's not that I believe your idea would be difficult, although it would be.  It's that I believe your idea is unnecessary, and misses the point that you are benefitting from your higher cost of living, and are not owed an extra tax writeoff for that benefit.</comment>

<comment>That maybe a significant administrative problem with it, but the larger problem is whether there can be any moral justification for it.  I don't think there is.  Government coercion says "might makes right", and they are going to try and take it anyways.If I had a large estate and was on my death bed, I'd burn it all to ash before letting the government take any of it.Maybe that's the solution.  Every one should just destroy any wealth that would get hit by the estate tax.  Or give it away at least three years before you die using the annual gift tax exclusion amounts.</comment>

<comment>Andrew Carnegie did that.</comment>

<comment>I have been making this same argument to my conservative friends for a while now.  I never understood the cognitive dissonance of trying to get rid of the estate tax while also trying to get rid of welfare benefits, telling the rest of us to pull ourselves up by our bootstraps.  Why does being your own person and making something out of yourself not apply to the children or rich people?  This country is supposed to be the antithesis of social stratification not the embodiment of it.</comment>

<comment>Here's the cognitive dissonance- if you make a startup and sell it for a ton of money, you can't decide what to do with that money if you get hit by a bus. It goes to the government instead of your kids. The article also glosses over the very real impact if death taxes are applied with great vigor. When Steve Jobs died, if you'd confiscated his wealth it would've meant forcing the immediate dumping of 7% of Disney's stock- dropping the price for everyone. Not to mention Apple stock.http://www.forbes.com/sites/tr...The article also glosses over the double-taxation issue. Joe sells his company for $100 million, pays $35 million in taxes for the income then gets hit by a bus. How much of the remaining $65 million do you think his wife should pay the federal government because Joe had the audacity to die?</comment>

<comment>To answer your question, 60 million seems fine.  Those kinds of objections fail because there are ways to plan the asset disposition.  Then there's life insurance, etc.As noted, he's only taxed once.  The estate would be the entity paying a different tax.The thing the wife should be pissed about is why he was holding all that wealth in his name only.</comment>

<comment>the $100 million would be taxed twice, that's the point. You taxed it once, now you want to tax it again. The "plan the asset disposition" is a funny dodge- basically it says "we intend to just rake you over the coals with death taxes, unless you got your paperwork in on time." In other words, whether you inherit is entirely dependent on how good your estate planner is. Good luck making that "fair."And given that "assets" are also land, intellectual property (see the fight over Michael Jackson's estate) and stock ownership; a large estate tax is an order to instantly liquidate. In the case of Steve Jobs, that would have meant dumping $4 billion in stock instantly even at current estate tax rates (something that didn't happen only because he had good estate planners, which is another way of saying he could afford to avoid what you want to do.).</comment>

<comment>"$100 million would be taxed twice"We don't tax the money.  We tax "persons", as that term is legally defined.As to planning exempting some of the wealth from taxation, so be it.  It doesn't prevent all taxation.  It facilitates the spending of the wealth, and avoids the rare anomalies like those you suggest.</comment>

<comment>"The thing the wife should be pissed about is why he was holding all that wealth in his name only."And if he'd been a widowed parent? His kids would get screwed over instead.Where does this weird jealous covetous mindset come from where people think they have a right to someone else's private wealth?  It's a mental disorder of the highest form.</comment>

<comment>"Where does this weird jealous covetous mindset come from where people think they have a right to someone else's private wealth?"Don't project.Face it, the guy's dead.  It's not HIS wealth.  Moreover, it's not his children's as he made no transfers to them.  Our society, laws, and economy permitted the accumulation of the wealth, a significant portion of it, should fairly be returned to the benefit of all.  Hell, it's only those same laws that permit the fiction of an "estate" in the first place.  It's not like the kids are left with nothing.</comment>

<comment>And who decides "all" or what is "benefit?" Corrupt politicians? </comment>

<comment>I don't have it, you do. So I can't be projecting it.The concept of estates and inheritance were how we prevented wholesale theft , riots, murder and other mayhem to stop the masses from looting someone's home (and their family's home) every time they passed away.I disagree with your definitions.  When I die, my assets belong to whomever I chose (by planning ahead with trusts and wills). It sure doesn't belong to you, either individually or as a collective. We have terms for people like that: barbarian, looter, graverobber.  Your attitude is just that of another moocher looking for a payday at someone else's expense.</comment>

<comment>"I disagree with your definitions."They're not my definitions - they are the law's.  Moreover, when you're dead, you have no assets - they belong to the estate.  The estate only exists through the power of the state.  Change the laws if you don't like it, but, stop pretending that they're different from what they are."a payday at someone else's expense"Hate to point out the truism, but there are no other kinds of "paydays".</comment>

<comment>"How much of the remaining $65 million do you think his wife should pay the federal government because Joe had the audacity to die?"The actual amount the wife would pay is zero. All property left to a surviving spouse passes free of estate tax.Please come up with a better example of the cold, unfairness of it all.</comment>

<comment>Okay, so you'd take it all if there was no wife, just his daughter. Got it.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. What did the daughter do to earn the money? She was born? Why should she get this income (that's what it is -- unearned income) tax-free, when she has never paid tax on it before?Plus, I wouldn't take it "all" -- the tax rate isn't 100%This only applies to people who have huge estates. We're not talking about a remotely everyday occurrence, but people who are getting a tremendous amount of wealth (at least $5.35 million).</comment>

<comment>So people will save for... what exactly? To give you money? Good luck.</comment>

<comment>I save money, and don't have any children.  I save because I'd like to have flexibility and security as an old man.  If I had children, then sure, I'll be happy to pay their tuition should they attend college, but can't imagine my wife or myself setting "make sure the kids don't have to do any real work for a living" as a savings goal.</comment>

<comment>Funny, my dad had kids and so do I, my dad likes having fun with my kids. I'm 50 years old, I do lots of real work for a living and always have, and there's every reason to believe my mom and dad will be around when I'm well into my 60s or later. My mom was 72 when her dad died and left her some money. My father-in-law was over 65 when his mom died. If my wife and I inherit any money it's not going to be until we're after retirement age which means it isn't going to have the slightest impact on whether I ever do any "real work" for a living. But depending on my health as I get old it could impact whether I pay for my retirement home stay or you do.It's odd that everyone here seems to assume people inherit money at a young age and it subsidizes sloth.You have no interest in donating to foundations, church, alma matter? You want to just give it all to Uncle Sam? Keep in mind the premise of this article is that the feds will just take it from you and blow it all.</comment>

<comment>You have no interest in donating to foundations, church, alma matter? You want to just give it all to Uncle Sam?I'm not exactly sure how this applies to the estate tax.  If the threshold is five million (approximately the cutoff for estate tax), your estate is worth ten million, and you donate five million to charity or use it to establish a charitable trust, then Uncle Sam doesn't get any money from your estate.Also, unless you insist on a particularly refined standard of living, five million dollars should be enough for anyone to stop working for a living at any age and can pay for an excellent nursing home if necessary, since a very conservative 4% ROI gives you a pre-tax income of 200 grand (on top of Medicare and SS benefits, which are not means-tested.)</comment>

<comment>You should join this discussion- it's about an article up above that says basically that Uncle Sam should just take it all no matter how much you've saved.</comment>

<comment>You should join this discussion- it's about an article up above that says basically that Uncle Sam should just take it all no matter how much you've saved.Oh, I must be on the wrong page.  The article on my screen says:"Critics of the estate tax frequently argue that taking away even a fraction of someoneâ€™s wealth upon dying also takes away his or her motivation to work while alive. Thatâ€™s something to worry about if every asset was forfeited to the state, but a fair estate tax doesnâ€™t necessitate a total redistribution of wealth."They must be running a Point/Counterpoint feature, because this is the opposite of the article you're apparently referencing that urges a 100% tax on all estates.In fact, I can't find a single place in this article that suggests anything more radical than re-lowering the exemption.  There is this idea in the beginning, I guess:"What if a $5.43 million exemption applied to accumulated income, and no such exemption existed for estates?"No taxes on earned or unearned income, except for inheritances, during one's lifetime?  Damn, I'm sorry you got stuck reading an article by a Communist, because the one I see is quite the opposite.  Maybe I need to clear my browser's cache.</comment>

<comment>Oh my, the "don't take me seriously just because I'm being serious" argument?All that hoo-ha about inheritance being in-American and an unfair "windfall" that's like winning the lottery... Well, never mind. What we meant to say is that we're just proposing a minor- really unnoticeable increase in just an irrelevantly small part of the tax. The good news is that when you guys are called on your proposals you run from them.The bad news is you pretend to still believe in them while you run.</comment>

<comment>Yes, everyone who disagrees with you is concealing extremism.  We secretly want to take all your money and give it to the government, and polite tax policy discussions of estate tax rates and exemptions are just a front.Look, if I can get through this conversation without suggesting that you pine for the re-installation of a moneyed aristocracy in America - because I genuinely don't believe it, not merely out of courtesy - maybe you can give the hyperbole a pass too.</comment>

<comment>There is a world of difference between righting the injustice of inherited wealth and making a marginal change because ..."hey here's a way to raise taxes we haven't messed with in a while!" Look again at the headline of this article, there is nothing "un-American" about not wanting a tax increase. I'm sorry to lay it on thickly, but this is the point- they start of with a pseudo-"principled" article about the need to fix the inequity of wealth distribution, I and others point out the fallacies. Now here we are at the stage where you acknowledge people really should be able to do whatever they want with the money they saved, you'd just like to skim a bit more than you're taking now. It frustrates me because it's basically Bernies whole schtick- we're going to raise taxes and give everyone free stuff! Can you believe those lying Republicans, they claim were going to raise taxes to give everyone free stuff!</comment>

<comment>All charitable gifts or to create charitable trusts are deductible from inheritance tax.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, which means putting a huge tax hike on inheritance will net the government diddly squat because nobody is going to consciously hand over their life's savings to the government. The honest proponents know this is purely driven by a desire to punish. The dishonest ones claim it will result in a huge windfall for the federal government that we can spend on free stuff for everyone.</comment>

<comment>They live in a time warp where it's still 1890 and the life expectancy is 40. </comment>

<comment>What did you do to earn any of it? Even through a proxy like government.Nothing but disguised thievery.</comment>

<comment>Yes. You have every right to things someone freely wishes you to have. You have no right to demand something through force. Whether it's picking someone's pocket or sending cops.</comment>

<comment>the wife would pay nothing because she's his wife.  We're talking about and have always been talking about the children.  The question is why should Jr. get anything?  His dad did all the work.Should I get my lottery winnings tax free just because I happened to be related by blood to the commissioner of the lottery board?</comment>

<comment>it's illuminating that you think someone's life's work is the equivalent of "winning the lottery." He or She made the money, you taxed the heck out of it along the way, now they get to do what they want with it. It's called freedom, try it some day.By-the-by, there really is no way to structure your new found zeal for confiscating savings and assets in such a way that you'll ever get them. Nobody's going to simply hand over everything they've worked for to you. There's always a way. Even if they can't give it to the kids, they aren't giving it to you.</comment>

<comment>No one is asking for "everything". And that person is not "doing what they want with it"--they are DEAD. Someone *else* just received a bunch of money, and they should be taxed on it, as other people are taxed on money that they receive. Money is taxed as it exchanges hands. I pay income taxes on my salary, then when I spend it I pay sales tax, and if I give it to someone else then they pay taxes on it. If anything, death should make this even more obvious as the person who earned the money and paid any previous tax literally no longer exists.</comment>

<comment>And this is why people declare scholarships, financial aid,  and the value of  food stamps and public housing as income every April 15.</comment>

<comment>Yes, actually. Some of it. You should learn more about taxation before getting so worked up about it.</comment>

<comment>and he or she does not pay the tax.  The inheritor pays the tax, the inheritor who has done nothing to deserve the windfall save for being related by blood.  So yes it is exactly like winning the lottery.If I transfer a million dollars to you right now do you seriously think you should get it for free?  Why would it make any difference if the money is transferred to you after I'm dead?  Or if we're related or not?</comment>

<comment>funny, you want everyone's money transferred to you (as a citizen of the United States represented by the US government). What gives you greater claim than their family?I'm saying he/she worked for it, they got taxed on it, they should be able to do anything they please with it. Yes, including giving it to their kids, their dogs, their church, Greenpeace, Bernie, whatever. Nobody has ever written a will after they died. And if you manage to pass some law confiscating money you won't ever collect it because nobody who managed to save money is going to be dumb enough to leave in some form that the IRS can confiscate (well, except Michael Jackson apparently).</comment>

<comment>still pretending the dead person is the one paying the tax I see.</comment>

<comment>An irrelevant detail.  There is one pot of money. The tax gets paid out of it, no matter who put the money in, or who takes it out.  Sophistry much?</comment>

<comment>only depending on who takes it out.  Again its the inheritor who pays the tax based on who they are and how much it is.</comment>

<comment>I don't know where to jump in, so I'll jump in here.Don't listen to them Jeffn, they're all f*cking idiots who are mad some friends of theirs had more money than them growing up, and don't want to work hard so that their kids can enjoy the same thing. They just want to rob us all.</comment>

<comment>The person who receives the money didn't do anything to "earn" it. That's the point. What the person who left the estate did is immaterial. They are dead. They aren't r Iteceiving the money.Anyway, everyone is taxed multiple times on the same original amount. I get paid a salary. I pay payroll taxes. I pay income taxes. I pay sales taxes if I buy something with the same money. It's not a moral outrage when it happens to me and it isn't a moral outrage when it happens to anyone else.</comment>

<comment>They did earn it. You don't automatically end up in someone's estate. You have to behave a certain way to be in someone's will. Being family doesn't automatically get you inheritance. The dozens of cases of people giving everything to charity or their driver because their children disappointed them shows that. </comment>

<comment>Because that is likely the result the dad would want.Your lottery hypo is ridiculously off course. The lottery commissioner doesn't own the jackpot winnings. But if he leaves you something he does own when he dies, you shouldn't have to pay a tax on it. It was taxed once already as he earned it.</comment>

<comment>I agree wholeheartedly.If somebody is against estate taxes and is against breaking up companies that are too large to compete, then I really don't want to hear their arguments that competition keeps people working hard and that's why capitalism works well for everyone in America. We don't have fair competition, so no, we do not have fair access to wealth and success in this country.</comment>

<comment>Don't blame capitalism. Blame crony capitalism and a corrupt government. BTW-people aren't supposed to have fair access to wealth, they should have fair access to EARN wealth.</comment>

<comment>It literally takes money to make money in this country. Even without investing in any other way, someone who inherits money in bank accounts and mutual funds may already benefit from the fact that those businesses charge lower fees to those with higher balances. A higher starting wealth through inheritance gives someone an unfair ability to earn wealth over someone who doesn't. I'm not blaming capitalism, I'm saying that people ignore the parts about competition.</comment>

<comment>If you work and consume less than you produce then you can accumulate capital/wealth. It doesn't necessarily take money to make money. One can also use credit to accumulate wealth if that credit is used for productive purposes and not just for consumption. Businesses get loans or lines or credit all the time. Many millionaires and billionaires weren't born rich. Some even give a lot of their wealth away without the strong arm of the government.Secondly, I get what you're saying about someone with a large inheritance having an advantage over someone who doesn't but is it unfair? If you gave your child a bike for their birthday but the kid down the street got a skateboard because that's what the parents could afford, is that unfair or just part of life? Would you feel guilty if took your family to Disney but your friend could only afford Great America for their family? What if the roles were reverse, would you be envious and jealous? It sounds like you would be. Everyone can't be a millionaire after all and even if we all were, not all of us would be rich.Personally, I would rather see my offspring benefit from the wealth I accumulated (which has already been taxed) over my lifetime than have the government take it and waste it (don't get me started on government waste).</comment>

<comment>There isn't any cognitive dissonance here.  Welfare is money you didn't earn that was taken from its rightful owner under the threat of force.  An estate is money you didn't earn given to you freely by the rightful owner. Conservatives to the extent they are economic libertarians, like free will and dislike coerced actions done under threat of violence.Also, what this country is supposed to be is a place where the rights and property of the people is protected.  If that produces social stratification then oh well, freedom is messy.</comment>

<comment>That's too funny. The rich are so much our betters, that even their unearned income is more deserved.Also, you need to look into how many of the super-rich families in the United States, particularly in the first couple hundred years of the country, earned their massive amounts of wealth. You'll see plenty of "violence" and lack of "free will."</comment>

<comment>The income was taxed when it was originally earned.  You seem interested in the ultra wealthy in ancient history, but lets look at a more common example.A kid gets accepted into UCLA where the on campus tuition is $34,000 a year.  Their parents can't afford to help and they can't afford the tuition either, but their grandma decides she is going to use the money from grandpa's life insurance policy to help out and offers to pay the first year. That student now owes gift taxes on $24,000.  It isn't just estate taxes than punish people for wanting to use their money to help people they care about and it isn't something only ultra wealthy run into.</comment>

<comment>Actually, there is no gift tax liability in that case. Gifts for qualified educational expenses are subject to an ADDITIONAL $20,000 exemption per donor. Then Grandma can give up to the $14,000 limit as well. The gift tax liability sums to zero.</comment>

<comment>It turns out he actually got accepted to Vassar too and when he heard grandma was going to help him he decided to go there and needs $51,300.  No he has to pay taxes on $17,300.</comment>

<comment> An estate is money you didn't earn given to you freely by the rightful owner.The step that you're skipping (hint: it's the reason probate exists) is a key point in this argument.  A will is not a gift list.  It is a set of instructions to guide the disposal of an estate.  You don't inherit money from a person; you inherit it from an estate, and estates can have obligations that outweigh those to its named inheritors.If your father writes a will leaving you a million dollars, and has outstanding debts of a half-million dollars, you don't get to wave the will around as an excuse to stiff the creditors, even though it names you as the new owner of said money.There are plenty of people who can have a right to that money before the inheritors; you just disagree with one of those entities' claims for ideological reasons, as evinced by your characterization of taxation as robbery (instead of as a pretty reasonable price for living in the most prosperous and powerful nation that has ever existed.)</comment>

<comment>Trusts avoid probate.</comment>

<comment>Trusts, established properly, can also avoid creditors and litigants.  Lots of people have the foresight to set them up while they're still alive, even for amounts that wouldn't be subject to estate tax.  But I thought we were discussing estates, which are subject to estate tax.</comment>

<comment>given to you freely by the rightful ownerYeah, you know there is such a thing as a gift tax, right?</comment>

<comment>You know in the context I used the word "freely" it means without coercion, right?  Not free as in without cost.</comment>

<comment>The notion is that people should support themselves, with private means.  Rich people, and the children of the rich, do not take from the public purse, whereas the poor do.  Confiscate the assets of the rich, and you'll simply have more poor people taking from the public purse, with government squandering the ill-gotten gains in the most suspect manner possible.Why would we confiscate private assets that could be used to sustain countless generations of families in order to enrich a government that spends like an imbecilic drunkard at a payday lender?</comment>

<comment>Why would we confiscate private assets that could be used to sustain countless generations of familiesExcept how often does that happen?  One of the best tongue-in-cheek arguments I've ever seen against the estate tax points out that the third- or fourth-generation wealthy are pretty efficient at shoveling capital into the economy without any help from the government, what with their tendency to act like imbecilic drunkards themselves.</comment>

<comment>I believe the saying is rags to riches to rags in two generations or something similar.</comment>

<comment>What if I want to be the next Rothschild? Who cares how often money makes it from generation to generation. We are arguing against blatant theft, and you are arguing for. That is the real argument.</comment>

<comment>What if I want to be the next Rothschild?Then I'd suggest you relocate to a country modeled after the Holy Roman Empire.Who cares how often money makes it from generation to generation.People who are concerned with consequent issues that probably don't concern you very much, and some of the wealthy people named in the article above.  Indeed, most of the people throughout history who've written on these issues came from money.We are arguing against blatant theft, and you are arguing for.No, you are framing taxation as theft, and then patting yourself on the back for not wanting to pay taxes.That is the real argument.That is the story you tell yourself, because a heroic struggle against injustice is exciting.  It's certainly more thrilling than an eternal, sustained grumble about the fact that civilization is not so perfect as to be free and without waste.</comment>

<comment>No. You are arguing for theft, plain and simple. In fact, you are arguing for theft at the point of a loaded gun, because that's all taxes are at this point.Payroll and estate taxes are nothing more than theft. Theft, theft, theft, theft, theft. I'd rather be literally robbed in an alley than have the Gov take my money so that it can- pay for peoples sex change operations; engage in more wars; help black people continually abort themselves; give welfare to illegals and healthy people; continue to subsidize the ethanol/petroleum/clean energy industries; build bridges to nowhere; etc., etc., etc. At least I know if I'm robbed in an alley, that person is probably going to go buy some drugs and eventually kill himself by overdose. That, and he only robs me once. Instead, I am robbed every two weeks by a government ~80 trillion in debt and telling me everyday that I am "privileged" to be robbed.Know what? I am still going to make mine, though. I will continue to do what all people who've made their money the hard way do- stash my holdings in so many proverbial mattresses that not even God will know where it all is. And you'll keep crying about fairness or whatever, all the while not knowing that the policies you fight for actually work against you, and you'll remain poor. Keep it up, because the more people like you, the easier it is for me to make mine. It's pretty easy when half the country basically doesn't work. Much easier for the rest of us to accumulate assets.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the above post definitely indicates that you're smarter than the people who built the most prosperous nations in the world during the 20th century.  Taxes are theft at the point of a gun?  What an original thought, nothing at all like an overwrought slogan from Rothbard's Ethics of Liberty or any other Randian or anarcho-capitalist ranter.You have a very realistic, not-at-all hyperbolic or blinkered  understanding of how a society prospers to the point that you can sit at your computer complaining about that society.  Congratulations on your brilliance, and thank you for taking time out of your obviously busy schedule of money-making to share your thoughts with the group.</comment>

<comment>Did I argue I was smarter than the Founders? No. I will state that I am smarter than you, because that much is painfully clear (I'm not exactly setting a high threshold).But am I not wrong? I believe Wesley Snipes found out recently what happens when you don't pay taxes.And shame on me for wanting this already great country to be even greater. Damn, my bad.</comment>

<comment>Did I argue I was smarter than the Founders?The Founders were around in the 20th century building our country into a global superpower?  Or are you just giving them credit for the postwar economic order that included estate taxes?  That would be weird, because you seem to wish we had the same tax structure as a 19th century agrarian nation.And shame on me for wanting this already great country to be even greater.No, shame on you for thinking that anarcho-capitalist claptrap had anything to do with this nation's unmatched prosperity in the past hundred years.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm crediting them for founding a nation that allowed for the bastardization of any and all economic sense that happened in the 20th century. Believe it or not, but there are many, many, many people who believe that basically ALL of the economic policies implemented in the early 20th century did more harm than good, and actually hindered the US from being even more powerful and rich than it currently, supposedly, is now.But yeah, good job, I am for reverting back to a tax structure that is basically what we had in the 19th century. Your reading comprehension perhaps isn't as bad as I thought.And I don't believe anarcho-capitalist claptrap. Are you equating my belief in a much simpler tax code with claptrap? I firmly hold the opinion that we are simply sitting on the greatest piece of real estate on the face of this planet, and that it would take a level of incompetency not yet seen, but certainly possible, to screw everything up.And guess what? Our tax structure and massive debts and the belief that Joe deserves more of Fred's money simply because Joe is "disadvantaged" is having us resemble the rest of this planet's ass backwards, incompetent, countries. I do not apologize for not wanting to more resemble the rest of this planet.</comment>

<comment>Believe it or not, but there are many, many, many people who believe that basically ALL of the economic policies implemented in the early 20th century did more harm than good, and actually hindered the US from being even more powerful and rich than it currently, supposedly, is now.Yes, I'm already aware that there are plenty of people on both right and left who look at the history of the American 20th century and think, "What a tragic failure."  There are plenty of people who believe all sorts of strange things.But yeah, good job, I am for reverting back to a tax structure that is basically what we had in the 19th century.That would be appropriate, maybe, for the nation we had in the nineteenth century.  This is an entirely different society and economy, and has been since before either of our parents were born.  Our present stable social order was born out of pre-Depression society, where conditions were sufficiently awful for the vast majority that we had actual no-shit Communists and Fascists rallying supporters and planting bombs in American cities.  You're not going to turn back the clock by re-creating a moneyed aristocracy; you would just be creating a new form of anti-democratic politics that would be unprecedented in a modern post-industrial society.And I don't believe anarcho-capitalist claptrap. Are you equating my belief in a much simpler tax code with claptrap?No, I'm calling out your parroting of the "Taxation is theft" slogan as anarcho-capitalist claptrap.  Seeing as it was most clearly expressed by an on-again, off-again Rand acolyte named Murray Rothbard in 1982, even if you don't believe it is claptrap, it is certainly a sentiment originating in anarcho-capitalism, though its appeal has spread to overly dramatic people who are just cranky about having to pay taxes.I firmly hold the opinion that we are simply sitting on the greatest piece of real estate on the face of this planet, and that it would take a level of incompetency not yet seen, but certainly possible, to screw everything up.We agree, although I'm pretty sure we have a very different idea of what policies would be incompetent.</comment>

<comment>I take back what I said, you clearly have no reading comprehension.For the last time, I am not against all taxes. For f*cks sake, I've said it a couple different times now. I am simply against the payroll/income tax and estate tax, as I view them as legalized theft of a persons person-hood. Taxes in and of themselves are necessary to run a government. I understand that. However, I, as well as many others, are of the opinion that the tax regime we implemented at the beginning of the 20th century has been extremely harmful. You can disagree with me on this; I'm okay with that, as I deal with idiots like you on a daily basis. I do like Rothbard though, but that is neither here nor there.Oh, and what I am not okay with is your apparent lack of reading comprehension... Yet another person failed by the US education system, you are.</comment>

<comment>For the last time, I am not against all taxes.Sorry, I must have been confused by your imprecise statement that I am "arguing for theft at the point of a loaded gun, because that's all taxes are at this point."  In normal English usage, that absolute declaration makes your further ranting invective ("Theft, theft, theft, theft, theft") against payroll and income taxes appear to be a continuation, not a qualification, of that theme.It's also funny that, in another post you say you're OK with property taxes, since even to this old-school liberal they have the stink of the government charging rent for you to live in a house you own outright.However, I, as well as many others, are of the opinion that the tax regime we implemented at the beginning of the 20th century has been extremely harmful.Yeah, it really destroyed us as a nation, as long as you have a sufficiently imaginative definition of "destroyed." I do like Rothbard though, but that is neither here nor there.It's actually very much here, since "Taxes are theft" was a central idea in his work, and since you don't seem to understand that he was explicitly an anarcho-capitalist.  I mean, you like him, but you're unfamiliar with the school of political thought that he synthesized and godfathered?Yet another person failed by the US education system, you are.In light of your very limited studies in history and economics as displayed in these threads, I'll just leave the irony of this statement for any future readers who stumble in here by accident.</comment>

<comment>Ugh, you really are the demographic the Atlantic is shooting for. Good luck in life, you'll need it.</comment>

<comment>Ugh, you really are the demographic the Atlantic is shooting for.Oh, goodness no.  Judging by their advertisers, they're looking for people who waste more of their money on transient luxuries.Good luck in life, you'll need it.You too, buddy.  I suspect I've got at least a few more years under my belt than you do so far, and they've gone pretty damn well, but we can always use all the luck we can get.</comment>

<comment>Well, thanks for sticking me with the debt you accumulated over your life by living far, far, far beyond your means. And if you didn't personally, your generation sure as hell did.Always is nice to be a part of the first generation that isn't as well off as the previous generation. But, hey, you got yours, right? Who cares what you leave for those who follow.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...I'm in my mid-thirties, and am assuming you're in college.  Was my guess as far off as yours?</comment>

<comment>Mid 20's, between undergrad and grad school. And if you are in your mid 30s, you are ahead of the game, pure and simple. If I was in my mid 30's, dear lord, how awesome it would've been to have an extra 10 years head start on the travesty that is now.</comment>

<comment>On the bright side, at least you're not old enough to have sunk money or leverage into the pre-2008 real estate market.  A lot of friends my age bought homes after starting their first real jobs, because people ten or twelve years ago still believed there was no better investment, a message perpetually reinforced by the culture and media.  Not the insane McMansions, but places that were within their means...until the recession hit, property values tanked, and they were stuck for years with mortgages that made it impossible to relocate or even refinance.I bought my first property in 2010, and can't imagine how much different (and worse) my life would have been if I did that in 2006.  Then again, there was no way I could have afforded grad or law school back then, and probably will never have the time to attend now.  It's strange to think about how much the society we live in during our twenties affects the rest of our lives.</comment>

<comment>They, and everyone else who bought into the housing lie at the time, have no one to blame but themselves. As I am a highschool dropout, I was already working at the time. I remember telling a coworker of mine that he shouldn't buy a house yet, because knowledgeable people had been saying for years that there was a huge bubble, and everything was bound to pop soon. He went and bought a house anyways (to please his fiance, of course) and promptly lost about half his value; and we are in Houston, a place that wasn't hit that hard. We laugh a bit about it now, but he is still underwater.I sympathize with the Americans who bought into the lies they had been told their whole lives, but, at the same time, it is their own damn fault for the trouble they are in. If facts are smacking you in the face, you've gotta listen. If I could see the signs as a highschool dropout, why couldn't your friends? Why can't many Americans? You can only blame your environment so much. At some point, you need to take responsibilities for your actions. And all evidence points to the fact that generally speaking, the people who have money made their money the correct way- by starting their own business, saving, and living thriftily.Weird tax regime or not, those truly dedicated will always come out ahead. So you and I can argue all you want about what sort of taxes to pay, but, honestly, taxes don't really concern me. I already tax haven my income, and am preparing to limit my tax bill as best as possible for the rest of my life. Almost nothing this country does anymore gives me reason to believe my money will be spent wisely, so why give any money at all? People like me can always work the system. However, the poor/lazy/uninformed/whatever-reason-they-use-for-not-managing-their-money-correctly will never come out ahead with how our taxes are structured now. Taxes should be straight forward and easy, so easy that CPA's would basically no longer exist. No loopholes, no write-offs, nothing. You get 100% of your paycheck, sans whatever benefits you have, and can literally determine how much you get taxed. Don't want to pay much in taxes? Buy an older car, smaller home, better-made goods that don't need quick replacement. Hell, we can even leave foodstuff off of taxable goods, and just tax everything else.But then, is not the underlying argument, "Well, what about welfare!? SS!? Medicare!?" And I would tell you, I want them completely eliminated as well. Or, you fund them by the previously mentioned sales tax on goods, and nothing else. This way the citizens can finally truly have a say in how are government runs for the first time in over 100 years.Instead, the most productive members of this society get robbed to feed and clothe and whatever else the unproductive members of this society. I will not mince words here- all the welfare takers in this country could die, should die, overnight, and this country would be immediately better. Let churches and local communities take care of the social welfare of their neighbors, not force liberal Kathy in Massachusetts to support redneck hillbilly Jonah in Kentucky. What added value has been created? The answer is none, and that is an indisputable fact. This country in in ~$80 trillion in debt, fighting countless wars, fighting over every small issue, etc. No society in the history of man has stopped the collapse of their society once they are heavily indebted. Are you ready for the coming years? It's going to be pretty damn exciting for some, absolutely horrid for most, and they only have themselves to blame.</comment>

<comment>No one supports themselves. Do rich people pay for their own army, navy, air air force, police, courts, private property protection, infrastructure social and physical, law structure, I could go on forever.But for government and society no one would be rich. Corporations wouldn't exist. Stocks and bonds wouldn't exist. Private property wouldn't exist. Anything we are able to get from them is just, moral, fair, and right.</comment>

<comment>What dissonance? Giving someone something freely is very different from stealing from the dead in the name of "equality."</comment>

<comment>Yes, let me work my whole life to build an estate to pass down to my children, just so that the government can punish me and my family for my hard work and tax my money again for like the millionth time.Yeah, no. Color me stupid, but I don't want the government to have any of my money at this point.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry.  People who actually work that hard pretty much never have enough for the tax to apply.</comment>

<comment>Yeah... apparently Don'tLikeCops is in the .2% of the nation that would be affected by an estate tax.I don't know about you, but I'm completely sympathetic to the plight of millionaires who likely have a lower effective tax rate than I do due to the fact that they most likely owe more capital gains than ordinary income tax.</comment>

<comment>What's your point?</comment>

<comment>That either a) you're supporting super rich people keeping money which doesn't benefit you at all (and is a detriment to the rest of us); or b) you're only in it for yourself and don't care that it's detrimental to others.In either case, it's not exactly a sympathetic point of view. People probably shouldn't get free money without taxation. It serves no purpose and the heir certainly did nothing beyond being a member of the lucky sperm club to deserve the money.</comment>

<comment>Or, option #3... THAT I WANT TO KEEP THE MONEY I WORKED FOR, AND WANT THE SAME FOR EVERYONE ELSE.For you, dumb f*ck.http://www.investopedia.com/fi...Most people in the US have earned their millions. Most people who are wealthy are not lucky for sh*t, they simply worked hard and saved and started a business. Our taxation laws make it super hard for people to get rich the correct way- save most of what you earn, and invest properly. Instead, we write laws and incentivize a reckless consumption culture and tax everyone into oblivion.</comment>

<comment>So, you want to use all the tax funded resources but not pay your fair share. Got it.You're talking to a tax attorney, someone who knows more about tax law than you and anyone you will ever meet. You got yours, screw everyone else, right?</comment>

<comment>Aw, poor tax attorney, boohoo. Should've gotten into corporate law, like where I am heading.And yes, screw everyone else. They didn't drop out of highschool, work a minimum wage labor job, work their way through college with consistent 70-80 hour weeks (oftentimes being literally out of state working in the morning, to then drive hours back to town to take night classes), get a decent degree, continue working and studying some more for law school, and then starting the process all over again. I have worked harder than all of my "disadvantaged" friends, and have reaped the correct benefits. I have friends who continually tell me they wish they would've buckled down like I did so that they could be where I am at now, and not where I was a decade ago. Oh, and yeah, took me 8 fucking years to do undergrad.I worked my ass off to get where I am now. And while some people think I literally just all-of-the-sudden had money, others know I had to work extremely hard. The last thing I want to see every pay period is money being taken out of my paycheck to fund a bankrupt government and bankrupt citizens.So, screw you and everyone that things they deserve the "right" to steal from me, simply because it makes them "feel" good.</comment>

<comment>You totally did it all by yourself. You were born on an uninhabited never before discovered island right? You never used any infrastructure, any programs, never services.I'm guessing you taught yourself everything you need to know and made everything that you use. For gods sake, you're a lawyer (you say), but for the government "a lawyer" wouldn't even be a job.</comment>

<comment>Did I say any of that? Are you f*cking retarded, or just trying to pretend you understand? I never said eliminate all taxes. I never said I do not enjoy public services. As a conservative, I am fully aware of whose shoulders I stand upon. Because I know a bit about the history of this country, I know the Founders are rolling in their graves as they see what we've done with taxes in this country. We have an immoral, despicable tax code that robs from one segment of the population to give to another totally worthless, p.o.s. segment of the population.Dumb f*ck, get some reading comprehension.</comment>

<comment>Oooh. You are so rough and tough. Yes. You are right. Taxes should only be for things you want and no taxes should be used for things you don't want.</comment>

<comment>"Or, option #3... THAT I WANT TO KEEP THE MONEY I WORKED FOR, AND WANT THE SAME FOR EVERYONE ELSE."But now you're dead. What work did your kids do to earn that money?</comment>

<comment>They are my kids. Who knows what sacrifices were made in the short term for the long run. It is my money, I worked for it, I was already taxed on it, I should be able to give it to any damn person I damn well please.Y'all's argument is essentially this- your heirs don't deserve your money, my heirs do. One side of the aisle is arguing for more blatant theft, and the other side against. I swear, all life is now is one long episode of the Twilight Zone.</comment>

<comment>Once you're dead, you can't give anything. You're dead. We're taxing the transfer of funds from your estate to your kids. If your kids are receiving income, they should pay taxes on it. Currently, we're only asking them to pay taxes on the amount above $5.43 million. By your logic, your lawyer shouldn't pay income tax on what you pay him because that money was taxed when you earned it.</comment>

<comment>Are you f*cking serious? You can't distinguish between money handed down to one's kids, and the money you pay a lawyer for services rendered? ARE YOU SERIOUS? They aren't receiving income, they are receiving an inheritance. The two are so separate that, that, that.... F*ck it. This country is f*cked. The thieves in this country have no shame anymore, and now evenly match the non-thieves. You ready for the war? 'Cuz you're sure as f*ck asking for it.</comment>

<comment>"It is my money, I worked for it, I was already taxed on it, I should be able to give it to any damn person I damn well please."My point is just the logical extension of your comments here and previously. You've argued against income tax elsewhere in the thread. The transfer from your estate is already a privileged transfer of funds. the first $5.43 million isn't taxed.</comment>

<comment>And the next infinity dollars after that should be tax free as well. And how you think stealing someones inheritance is a logical extension of my argument is beyond me. There is a very big difference between what is essentially a gift, and services rendered. And why is it a privileged transfer of funds? Because it's a lot of money? And you assume I am somehow privileged to have that money? That I didn't work hard for that money? That you deserve it more than my heirs?"By your logic, your lawyer shouldn't pay income tax on what you pay him because that money was taxed when you earned it."So, if I wasn't taxed on my income, like I wish, and the lawyer wasn't taxed on his income, like I wish, then the only time tax would come into play is when I pay him for services rendered. Thus, only one tax, instead of the three taxes we pay now. Still, what the f*ck is your point? Other than you want to be a thief.</comment>

<comment>"Color me stupid, but I don't want the government to have any of my money at this point."So you're against all taxation? Well, I guess that partly explains why you "don't like cops" -- you don' think they should even exist, as their salaries come from taxes.</comment>

<comment>I'm wholeheartedly against wealth confiscation taxes. So, that would mean no death tax, as well as no income tax.And you would be right about my name, I don't think cops should exist.</comment>

<comment>Well, you are consistent. I'll give you that.</comment>

<comment>Consistency is the key to success, no? Even the idiotic liberals in this country understand that, at least in regards to pretty much everything but hard work.</comment>

<comment>I'm wholeheartedly against wealth confiscation taxes. So, that would mean no death tax, as well as no income tax.That would also mean no property taxes, since property is the classic form of wealth.  So now we're down to, what, payroll and sales taxes?  Yeah, that's the recipe for a stable society: Shift the tax burden off of the investor class and onto the people who do the work, and who have a much higher percentage of their income going back out to pay for taxable items.</comment>

<comment>Payroll tax would be out as well. We should have a sales tax, and maybe a property tax. Property taxes are actually pretty good at helping revitalize rundown areas, and generally have a much better argument for them than against them, even by Austrian standards.And who is buying Bentleys, 1st generation $10k TVs, $22k watches... Pure and simple, the more money you have, the more you buy, the more you pay in sales tax. And, since you didn't have money stolen from you straight out of your paycheck, and know you only really get taxed one way, you can much better allocate your funds.But really, none of that matters. From a philosophical viewpoint, I hate, in particular, payroll/income taxes. Your paycheck is a stand-in for your value over time. By taxing your paycheck whatever percentage, the government is telling you they literally own a percentage of you. You literally cannot support yourself in this day in age without also willfully selling your soul to the proverbial devil, and I do not like that.Oh, and if you're gonna bring up the whole, "well payroll taxes support SS and medicare and blah blah...", I don't care about those programs and want them gone as well.</comment>

<comment>This will never happen, it would kill the US status as a safe-haven for foreign investors.More class-warfare nonsense. </comment>

<comment>"cherished American ideal of fairness"Your idea of fairness likely differs from mine."the idea that people should control their estates well beyond their death"You allude to this several times, but it's little more than convenient framing.  Are you honestly saying that someone shouldn't be able to prevent an immature youth from receiving millions that he would be incapable of handling all at once?  Or is simply passing on wealth your idea of controlling something for generations?  Because if so, that's a little bit....odd.  Especially when later in the piece you say "Calling it a death tax cleverly shifts the focus from the receiver to the giver."  Isn't that what you're doing when you argue for the tax by framing it in the way I noted above?  Which is proper, focusing on the giver or receiver, or whichever best makes your case?"Indeed, itâ€™s surprising that many of the same people who oppose welfare on the grounds that its benefits are not tied to work can so stridently denounce estate taxes"Are there data to demonstrate how often these views coincide or is this an ideological straw man?  Can I try that too?  Here goes....most people who support estate taxes admire Sweden and Norway, both of which have....no estate tax?  Oh dear.  Further, if you can't distinguish between a welfare sponge and the recipients of privately owned generational wealth transfers, find other work."It would communicate a commitment to allocating societyâ€™s resources fairly and promoting equal opportunity."No it wouldn't.  It would signal a commitment to giving the government more money. Sadly, the government has nothing to do with fairness or equal opportunity.  You may wish it did, but it doesn't.</comment>

<comment>Your "death" vs "estate" is easy: is it a tax on death? If so, why doesn't everyone who dies pay it?  If Joe Smith, who owns $50,000 worth of assets dies, does he have to still pay a tax? Why not, if it is a "death" tax?Clearly, it is a tax on estates -- and it only applies when those estates are a) of a certain size and b) go to certain people. For example, if I die and leave my $15 million to my wife, there is no tax. But if I'm unmarried, die, and give my $15 million to my son (or my nephew), then it applies.  The person getting it is who matters. That's why "estate" is far more accurate.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps I wasn't clear with my wording, but I'm not challenging the nomenclature.  I'm simply wondering how one can simultaneously focus on the giver by questioning why he or she can "control" an estate posthumously and then criticize others for shifting focus to the giver.</comment>

<comment>Again, I think it's simple: the person getting the money is who matters. If it is a wife, zero tax; if it is a son, tax; if it is a charity, zero tax. The gift recipients are the one who benefits and thus are required (in certain circumstances) to pay the tax.The dead person doesn't pay the tax (again, because it is not a tax on death) so the focus shouldn't be on them.</comment>

<comment>Well, you seem to have a clear, consistent view.  I'm just wondering why the author doesn't.  It's the sort of inconsistency that makes me question whether he's arguing in good faith.</comment>

<comment>All I'm seeing is a very flimsy argument that the government should get a person's accumulated wealth after they die, because...government?Let's go ahead and cremate everyone after they die, using the fire to power government buildings.  They're dead, so screw what the family wants/needs.  Government's always right!</comment>

<comment>No, the argument is that the recipient should pay taxes on their unearned income.</comment>

<comment>Which was already taxed when earned.  It's a slimy cash grab; nothing more.</comment>

<comment>And the money you use to buy a car was taxed when you earned it as well. That doesn't exempt you from paying sales tax. If you pay a gardener to mow your lawn, he pays income tax on that, despite you having paid income tax on it previously. We tax the transfer of funds, not the funds themselves.</comment>

<comment>I am okay with the status quo, and to take it a step further, would advocate eliminating basis step up on estates that pass tax free to heirs --      that being said:There is a world of difference between the acts noted by the Founders -- elminating primogeniture so that large estates become four or five smaller entities --  and equating that to somehow being consistent with giving it to the government.   That is a stretch.There seems to be a commonly held belief that working hard and living frugally are a virtue.Yet -- what the estate tax says is that if you work hard, live frugally, and provide for yourself well into retirement -------- and die well before you run out of money---- you need for fork over some materail % of those funds to the government.Yet -- someone else who works hard, but spends extravagantly, doesnt provide for himself in retirement and has to use the social safety net provided by the government   ---   well, thats okay.</comment>

<comment>"You" don't need to fork over anything. "You" are dead.Your heirs, if they want the money, are the ones who need to fork it over. It's the people who didn't earn the money who have to pay the tax, if you decide to give it to them.So if you you live frugally, amass over $5.45 million, and you die, if the money bursts into flames, no one has to pay anything. Or you can give it to a charity -- same thing.</comment>

<comment>So does this mean that you are good with the tax threshold where it is at 5 million?</comment>

<comment>I'd have it be a little lower (especially considering all the easy ways to lower your estate, e.g., giving away gifts ahead of time), but sure -- $5 million is fine.</comment>

<comment>Of course, that simple a solution - giving the money away - is also taxed.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that simple solution is not taxed."Charitable Deduction: If the decedent leaves property to a qualifying charity, it is deductible from the gross estate."https://www.irs.gov/Businesses...- BTW, many of these comments are why there is so much support for eliminating the estate tax: they have no idea what it is or how it actually works.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that's not what you said.  You said, "giving gifts ahead of time" which does not merely reference *charitable* giving.  There is such a thing as a "gift tax."  Its one of those provisions that exists to try to close loopholes in the estate tax.  As with most gaming of the estate tax system, it isn't terribly efficient in terms of gaining revenue.In truth, the fact that so few people are subject to the estate tax and such effort is given to avoiding it is probably the best policy-related reason for the complete repeal of the tax.  When a tax realizes such efforts (probably more spent in tax avoidance than in actual revenue), it is inefficient and deserves repeal.</comment>

<comment>It was just one example. That's what "e.g." means.You can give gifts ahead of time (tax-free) to your family *and* give it all away (tax-free) to charity at the end. You can do both, along with numerous other things.And if you want to make it simpler by eliminating some of those options, fine by me. But it absolutely should be kept for the reasons listed in the article. It's a huge amount of unearned income.</comment>

<comment>You can only give it away to your spouse tax-free, and spouses are exempt from estate tax anyway. So if you give it away ahead of time, it will still be taxed.</comment>

<comment>So your problem is with the idea that its unearned?  Perhaps we should call the tax the "jealousy" tax?Yes, "e.g." means "for the sake of example," however your example was inexact.  You may have meant charitable giving, but you didn't restrict it.  And, by the way, giving gifts to your family ahead of death is also, at certain levels, subject to the gift tax.Finally, as I mentioned, the estate tax is inefficient, economically.  Since it occasions a huge amount of spending in avoidance, it harms the economy for what really is a small amount of governmental revenue.</comment>

<comment>"So your problem is with the idea that its unearned?"Why wouldn't someone have a problem with that?  How is it fair that one person breaks their back day in and day out, and pays taxes on every penny they earn, while another person who was born to the right parents gets a windfall they never earned, and they pay nothing in taxes?</comment>

<comment>I was actually going to comment the same regarding the basis step up. Why should something escape (the generously low) capital gains tax merely because someone died? It's not like the transfer would create a taxable event, so there wouldn't be taxes due. The taxes would just get paid out of the sale proceeds when the asset is sold.But, I'm fine with lowering the threshold for estate tax. It's patently absurd that .2% of the nation is effected by the estate tax. It should at least be 1%, probably more than that. Especially with the basis step up. Though, I suppose, if you pay taxes on it, you should then get a basis step up or else you'd be paying taxes twice on the same money.Your comparison of the two people though is quite disingenuous. If you're living off social security, you're not living the high life. Also, rich people get social security as well. If you're referring to Medicare paying for nursing homes, I'd rather the government pick up the tab there as part of a single payer health system and allow the transfer of assets to beneficiary (to be taxed at the time of transfer, or maybe after death, probably after death so as not to jeopardize the transferor's ability to have the transferee pay for anything the transferor needed).</comment>

<comment>One of the most powerful ideas that came out of the Enlightenment was the challenge to the notion that just because your ancestor did some service to the King, you should be gifted with an estate and all the wealth they create.Why shouldn't every person be self-made, that every person start out life with an equal footing?</comment>

<comment>That idea is rather fair. Should every Nobel Prize-winner's kid also get a Nobel Prize?...</comment>

<comment>I'd also throw in a strong estate tax system helps prevent the formation/reinforcement of an aristocratic elite who are only in charge because their great-great-great-great-grandfather was a good businessman who got rich.</comment>

<comment>"...because their great--great-great-grandfather was a good businessman who got rich"If you are referring   to people like  Astor, Vanderbilt, Field, Gould,    et al., they were not good businessmen, they were predatory  sociopaths.Wealth will be concentrated     into fewer hands unless measures are taken to   prevent such an    outcome; the  Founders considered an estate tax less as a source of revenue than as a means of preventing the destruction of the republic by dynastic families.</comment>

<comment>We are steadily becoming a nation of fools taken in by engineered phrases like "death taxes," not knowing or even caring that the vast majority of us will never build enough wealth in our lifetimes to qualify for the privilege of paying such taxes.</comment>

<comment>I think it's important to remember that there are many, the author of this piece included, who would like to see the threshold lowered so that plenty more of us have the "privilege" of paying it.  That's where the resistance comes in, not in the existence of the tax, but in its expansion.</comment>

<comment>Your answer doesn't track with reality.Find me one significant politician (e.g., running for president; governor of a state) who backs a plan where the federal threshold will be lowered to an amount where it will be expanded and thus affect a significant % of Americans.Heck, I just looked up Bernie Sanders, as I assumed he had a plan: sure enough it  "would exempt the first $3.5 million on an individualâ€™s estate from estate tax. A married couple could shelter $7 million". Tell me why that number should be a concern to 99% of Americans. And this is the plan of a far-left socialist! Most mainstream Dems (e.g., Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton) aren't going to approach that "low" level -- they have Wall Street and Silicon Valley supporters to think of.Meanwhile, the Republicans have -- more than once -- passed legislation in the House to abolish the estate tax, and every Republican presidential candidate agrees it should be gone.So yes -- the "existence" of the tax is precisely in question.http://www.forbes.com/sites/as...</comment>

<comment>Ok, but we do have an estate tax, correct?  That tells me that the political will (not the rhetoric, the WILL) to abolish it is as non-existent as the will to expand it.  Congress passes legislation all the time that they know won't fly, just to appease the base.  Republicans have had the opportunity and numbers to abolish it several times over the last three decades, but haven't.  Why not?</comment>

<comment>"Republicans have had the opportunity and numbers to abolish it several times over the last three decades..."Man, you have not been paying attention.- This "death tax" obsession didn't start during the Reagan years, so three decades is irreleveant. It was a neologism started by Gingrich & Luntz during the mid-90s.- The only time they could have eliminated it was in the early 2000s and -- shocker -- the Bush tax cuts *did" eliminate the estate tax! It happened in 2009. They were brought back in 2010 by Obama & Congress -- at a $5 million exemption.So we've seen what happens when Republicans are in control (no estate tax) and when Dems are in control ($5 mil exemption). That's all you need to know.http://www.heritage.org/resear...</comment>

<comment>No, I haven't been paying attention.  I don't plan on dying anytime soon.  What I do know is this - that by the time I die, barring me blowing my wad on hookers and coke, I'll be over the threshold as it stands today.  But, like you mentioned in another comment, it's easy enough to avoid.  And avoid it, I will.  It's not that I oppose it in principle, but why on earth become a parent if not to give the kidlets the best life possible?  </comment>

<comment>rivercat, My wife and I also hope to leave something for my child, his wife and their kids.  I don't know how far you'll be over the threshold, so I can't determine whether or not your kids will have any motivation to contribute to the human enterprise after they receive the remains of your estate.  I would personally want my descendants to continue to lead productive lives despite what we might leave for them. What we should be concerned about as a nation are the increasing numbers of Americans who will receive so much from their estate "winnings" that they will have no reason whatsoever to do anything productive throughout their entire lives.  And, unfortunately, the lack of a reasonable estate tax and the loopholes for paying the meager tax as it exists today will ensure that many of he wealthiest in America can ensure that their descendants, into perpetuity, will live ultra-lavish, unproductive lives.</comment>

<comment>I gotcha and I don't disagree.  I seriously doubt I would be leaving enough for a lavish Kardashian style life, but at the current rate that I am growing net worth, it'll be a damn good cushion.  It will also be very structured.  The things you cite are the exact reasons that I believe people should continue to have control over their estates posthumously.  Give a teen 5 million after the sudden death of two rich parents and he'll be exactly what you describe.  Set up a conditional payment structure and they'll learn to value money even though they've always had it.My motivations aren't selfish, or completely selfish.  We are extremely invested in our local community and pretty generous.  Having come from a slum, I understand hardship and have a great deal of empathy for those in grinding poverty.  Which brings me to my other point - that I simply don't believe that handing the government a bunch of money after death will help anyone except for defense contractors and overpaid, useless bureaucrats.  From what I have seen, the belief that the government is an effective tool for raising people from dire straits is an absolute fantasy.  We already spend a helluva lot more than we collect and still these problems persist.  I'm not sure what that tells you, but it tells me that the federal government is a piss-poor remedy for our social and economic ills.  Giving them a few extra bucks from dead millionaires won't change that.  YMMV, of course.</comment>

<comment>I agree that there is government waste.  However, with our national infrastructure in such a sorry state, I can think of a lot of good reasons to increase tax revenue to fund necessary and effective government spending.  As we fall farther behind other developed nations infrastructure-wise, a continued preoccupation only with what the government does wrong will do nothing toward giving our kids a good future, regardless of how much we might leave them in inheritance.I've always believed that the easiest way to become a poor nation is to act like one.  Politicians and government officials who focus only on lowering taxes and complaining about big government while continuing to legislate massive amounts of unfunded spending are the real problem.  What government must do is determine what we need to do to fix the country and have enough nerve to admit that fixes will require a great deal of revenue.  Once we do that, we need to fix the tax system and start the business of rebuilding America.  By beginning the process of funding the much-needed rebuilding of our national infrastructure, we will ensure that our economy will continue to strengthen over time and we will have created a truly prosperous and competitive America for decades to come.I'm editing my comment because I forgot to mention that I agree 100% with your comment about defense contractors.  We are spending far too much on defense in general while one of our two political parties complains that we're spending far too little.  If we continue to allow the defense industry to drive so much government spending, we will never get a handle on our taxing and spending.</comment>

<comment>"(no estate tax)"IIRC that was a one time thing for one year only.</comment>

<comment>Did you also know that at one point we had no payroll tax? And that that tax only covered, what, 1% of the population at the time? It now covers what, 50%? The reason people are concerned about the estate tax is because we are concerned that eventually that threshold will be super low before too long- like $100k.On that note, f*ck the income/payroll tax as well.</comment>

<comment>You know only a couple percent of the country actually paid the original federal income tax.  Fast forward a hundred years and about half the people pay the federal income tax.  In other words taxes always tend to expand to cover more people.</comment>

<comment>Your point doesn't dispute the unfairness of the tax, just the fact that it's widespread.  That begs the question: how many people need to be treated unjustly before we should care?</comment>

<comment>Why should income that wasn't earned by the recipient be exempt from taxation?  How is THAT fair?</comment>

<comment>Is it just that a small number of families have unlimited wealth, as if there is some kind of divine right to the unlimited accumulation of wealth in perpetuity, as the ranks of the middle class and poor become increasingly less well off over time?</comment>

<comment>"Though Americans argue over whether income taxes should be higher or lower"I don't think there is any real argument since 52% of Americans say they pay too much income tax compared to only 3% that say they pay too little.  Which leaves what they think about how much other people should pay and I never trust anyone who expects others to pay a higher percentage than they are willing to pay themselves.http://www.gallup.com/poll/168...</comment>

<comment>How did the country survive the first 137 years without the federal tax and 134 years without the estate tax?Let's talk about "America's ideal of fairness" Is that like the 47% who don't pay or get back more than they paid in federal taxes? Fairness like illegally crossing the boarder and demanding that deportations stop, a pathway to citizenship be given, and social benefits/welfare be provided too? Fairness like taxing one's earnings twice?At least be honest and call it a wealth confiscation tax.</comment>

<comment>"How did the country survive the first 137 years without the federal tax and 134 years without the estate tax?"By not being the world's police force, for one thing.</comment>

<comment>No argument there.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, it is a wealth confiscation tax.</comment>

<comment>I was surprised that the article didn't reference this, but "Death by a Thousand Cuts" is an excellent history of the political process that led to this current state of affairs.http://press.princeton.edu/tit...The saddest/funniest aspect of this is how many studies consistently find that a large majority of people believe the estate tax is something that affects them.  I wound up bringing this up in conversation with my insurance agent a couple of years ago, and she rolled her eyes, saying that more than half of her whole & universal life customers ask how much of their insurance policy will be taken by the government, because they're worried that their surviving spouse might not be able to retire on the remainder.  With this level of plain ignorance about how inheritances work, it's unsurprising that a brilliant sleazeball like Frank Luntz would be able to convince millions of Americans that the government was planning to rob their graves.</comment>

<comment>On the double taxing question: there is no law that says the same gross income cannot be taxed multiple times. On your income you first pay income tax, and when you use what is left to buy something, you pay sales tax, double taxation. This is no reason why an inheritance should not be taxed.</comment>

<comment>The people pushing for estate tax repeal on ideological grounds would agree with you that we are constantly "double taxed."  They would also assert that this is why we need a national sales tax, a flat income tax, or whatever other half-baked idea to ensure that the wealthy maintain generational control over society is making the Internet rounds at the time.</comment>

<comment>A flat income tax might, actually make sure that the Warren Buffets pay the same percentage as their middle class secretaries.The problem is that the very rich earn their money as "investment income" and thus pay a lower tax than the secretary who earns "wages".</comment>

<comment>The problem is that the very rich earn their money as "investment income" and thus pay a lower tax than the secretary who earns "wages".Not to mention the cap on SSI-taxed income.</comment>

<comment>And if you use your post-tax income to pay someone else's income, they still pay income tax on it. Don't they know that money has already been taxed?!</comment>

<comment>If I strike it rich and then blow all the money gambling, I get a tax write off.  If I forgo Vegas and leave the money to my kids, I'm going against the "U.S. notion of fairness"?If there's an age old U.S. notion at play here, it's the notion that the government can better manage my affairs than I can.</comment>

<comment>What a terrible example. Are you saying that the casino that gets your money that you blew on gambling shouldn't pay taxes on it as income? After all, you decided to give it to them (that's what spending is).- Money given to the casino: income for casino- Money given to daughter: income for daughterWe allow a huge exemption for the daughter's income that was given to her, but it still is her income.And actually the age-old notion that you are arguing for is that rich people shouldn't pay taxes on their income, especially if they didn't earn it. Just because they are rich.</comment>

<comment>Also, you only get a tax writeoff of your gambling losses to the extent of your gambling winnings. So if you strike it rich and then blow all the money gambling, you're just broke and you still owe taxes.</comment>

<comment>Americans only say they want fairness. In reality, they want a plutocracy because they believe, heart and soul, they're one performance on American Singalong Tryouts or a successful pitch on Rich People Please Give Me Some Money So I Can Prove My Dad Wrong away from becoming a plutocrat.</comment>

<comment>Simple solution, treat inheritance as income for that year for the person receiving it, tax it at the prevailing income tax rates at the time in that year. It is basically that person's income for the year. No different that withdrawing all of your pre-tax money from the 401k or IRA in a particular year, that's your income for the year.</comment>

<comment>It's not cash though.  Which is the problem.  Let's assume that there are no exemptions. If you inherit your mom's house, let's say it's worth $100,000, you may have to pay $20,000 (or more)  in cash that year.  For most, that means selling "Mom's" house.Besides, the Very Rich know how to structure their holdings to avoid most taxes, probably not something a person who wishes to avoid a $20,000 tax bill can afford to do.So yes, it is very different than "cashing" in your IRA.</comment>

<comment>Most people would sell mom's house anyway</comment>

<comment>The author is a twitIn your scenario if the owner of a large company dies then the company goes under and everyone is out of a jobMarxists have never come to grips with how wealth is created and growth works.They just have a jealously based urge to steal from people who have more than them</comment>

<comment>In your scenario if the owner of a large company dies then the company goes under and everyone is out of a jobYeah, I also remember that terrible period from 1940 to 1982, when the American economy collapsed under the weight of 70% and greater estate taxes.  Businesses were closing left and right whenever their owners died.  The twentieth century really was the darkest time in American history.</comment>

<comment>Did you know the US was literally the only super power for all of those years? As hindsight is 20-20, we all know the Soviet Union was nothing more than a pretend player.The fact that the US has no natural enemies, that we are sitting on the closest thing to Eden there is, and have the world's reserve currency, is most of the reason why the US was so great, in spite of some asinine tax laws. We were also lucky enough to be practicing a much more clean version of capitalism then than we are today (much more cronyistic/fascistic now), and capitalism, basically in any form, is the best generator of wealth the world has ever known.Should I start following you around in threads just to comment how awfully stupid you are?</comment>

<comment>Did you know the US was literally the only super power for all of those years?Sure!  That has nothing to do with the OP's utterly insane contention that estate taxes drive companies out of business, since he seems to believe that the death of a company's owner necessitated the dismantling of the company.We were also lucky enough to be practicing a much more clean version of capitalism then than we are today (much more cronyistic/fascistic now)Anyone who can say that with a straight face might as well wave a big flag saying "I Have Never Studied Nineteenth Century United States History."Should I start following you around in threads just to comment how awfully stupid you are?If you're going to assert that our economy today is more corrupt than at the end of the nineteenth century, you might want to be careful slinging around the word "stupid."  Matthew 7:3, and all.  But it's a free country, and if you really want to spend your "valuable" time harassing someone on Disqus for knowing more than you about the history of American politics and economics, I'm not really sure I can keep you from it.</comment>

<comment>It is a death tax, as it doesn't trigger (with some exceptions) until the person is dead.In any case, the very rich know how to use trust and offshore entities that protect the heirs, if they wanted too.  It's the "poor rich" or rather their heirs that pay the taxes.</comment>

<comment>People who leave $5.43 million dollar estates at their death are usually unsophisticated rubes who have never even heard of a lawyer.</comment>

<comment>Depends on the estate.  If it's all in one home, and that happens in California, they may not be as sophisticated as you think a millionaire should be.</comment>

<comment>A personal observation:  I was the executor of my parents "estate" and my wife was the executor of her parents "estate".  If we had had to pay estate/inheritance tax - well, God Help Us.  It was hard enough without having to deal with the IRS looking over our shoulders.  As it was, i had to deal with some federal tax errors my mother made in her early 90's.  I fully support a $5 million starting point for estate taxes.</comment>

<comment>I think the reason there's so much opposition to the estate tax is an issue of framing. If estate tax supporters framed the question like: "You have to tax something, so would you rather tax earned wages and savings, or unearned inheritances?" I think they'd get a lot more support. I would certainly be on board with a deal to raise estate taxes if we cut income or capital gains taxes by the same amount.Inherited wealth is also destructive to capitalism. Capitalism is much easier to defend morally if you can argue that rich people deserve their wealth because they worked harder, made better decisions, created more value for others, etc. Capitalism seems arbitrary if rich people are just rich because they inherited it. A big estate tax would get us more than halfway to equality of opportunity, and should be seen as a small concession to keep the rest of the capitalist system viable.</comment>

<comment>I really wanted to be convinced to support the estate tax when I read this; I've wanted to for awhile because I am not rich (and need money) and the country could do a lot with this like fixing our crappy roads, bridges, and water utilities...but this still doesn't sound as ethically sound as you think.The basic argument seems to me circular, if I may paraphrase: "A lot of people need money and can't earn it one way or another and other people have it for whatever reason and may not have earned it. So, regardless if those two separate situations are connected or not, lets just take the money. They are rich, they won't miss it."I mean, I guess that is a solution, but obviously most Americans agree that you have a twisted definition of "fair." Judging by the way the government squanders money on the Department of Defense budget and education system (pork for both parties!) and generally screwed up healthcare "reform" there is no reason for intelligent citizens to believe it will be spent wisely anyway.</comment>

<comment>The basis of these conversations always returns to one salient fact: these are people talking about what to do with other people's belongings.</comment>

<comment>I don't think this author has a very firm grasp on what most Americans sense of fairness is.I don't see any fairness in taking away any part of the accumulated earnings of a family just because one member of it passes away.  Certainly society has no legitimate claim on that wealth.</comment>

<comment>Stealing from the dead is disgusting. </comment>

<comment>They're dead. They don't own anything anymore.</comment>

<comment>Yes they do. Everything you own is yours. What happens with it when you die is YOUR choice not that of glorified thieves in government.</comment>

<comment>As was stated above, this is only true within certain limits. If I have $1 million dollars and owe $500,000 to creditors, I can't just leave my kids $1 million dollars. They'll get what's left after the estates pays what I owed.</comment>

<comment>Since when has the government doing something made it right? The government is engaged in grave robbery. </comment>

<comment>Our problem is not collecting enough taxes.Our problem at every level of the US society from the Federal Government to the American consumer is our inability to efficiently allocate our resources in the most efficient, productive manner in order to maximize our returns.  Our government literally waste hundreds of billion in American financial capital every year by dropping bombs on various countries, propping up dictators, regime changes, supporting myriad so called moderates who are actually terrorists in the making, allowing illegals to flood into this country unabated enervating our educational and healthcare institutions, clogging our urban roads with more traffic, etc.We have a spending and financial resource allocation problem - not a tax problem.  Once we have addressed our financial resource dislocations and spending, then we can discuss how to efficiently assign taxes.</comment>

<comment>Any competent estate planning attorney can cover the estate tax and insure the passing of a majority of a persons wealth to the next generation. This is more of the same bs that tries to convince us all that taxes are bad and should all be outlawed and we will be better off. Let's ask our government to spend wisely and stop wasting our money and this whole thing will be mootExamples of waste:War on drugsWar on brown people all over world Pet projects pork etc.Quasi Healthcare </comment>

<comment>There needs to be a graduated system much as with income taxes.  The more the inheritance is worth, the higher the tax percentage should be.  But considering wage stagnation of the last 30 years, the paltry $15000 and a used car or whatever most parents manage to pass on to their kids these days has no business being taxed.</comment>

<comment>That's not way American oppose it, you work for your money, pay taxes when you earn it ... pay taxes when you spend it ... pay taxes when you save and invest it. Then you tax it again when you die is just too much.  Also you are not mentioning the power and intrusive action you have to give the IRS to prevent people from giving away their money before they die .... can you pay for your daughter wedding, can you give your son the family house, can you pay for your grandkids education ....</comment>

<comment>"Limiting the inheritance of wealth represents more than just an attractive means of raising revenue."Almost anyone can spend a pile of money; but very few are capable of accumulating a pile of money in the first place. It is preferable to allow high earners to delegate the spending of the money that they have accumulated to whoever they choose; rather than telling them to spend it themselves or lose it. Creating wealth is the valuable rare skill that society shouldn't want talented people to devote any more time to than they choose to devote - let successful people delegate the simple task of spending to their heirs or anyone when they choose to do so. Better than any immediate inheritance taxes on the wealth that would go to heirs and other beneficiaries would be a system where any inheritance imposes an equivalent tax on the heirs' own estates when the heirs eventually die themselves. That way (if they want to pass on anything to their own heirs) they have to grow their inheritance before they die themselves instead of just spending it.  Of course this approach would negatively impact the allegedly incidental "attractive means of raising revenue" for the government.</comment>
