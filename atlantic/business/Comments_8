<comment>We have amazing human capital. We are always recruiting more. So much potential is there, and if people had more to live on, they would spend more on goods and services. We need to work on housing supply, both rentals and family owned, and to get wages back up again. At the grassroots level we need to work on mindset. Immigrants are great teachers here. If a child can arrive in dire poverty, speaking no English, and make it to the top, then it is possible for any bright and determined native born American. We can't lose sight of that.</comment>

<comment>Anything is possible. What it decidedly is not is probable.</comment>

<comment>Wishful thinking. The only solution is to reverse population growth, and that won't happen.</comment>

<comment>Reversing population growth would lead to a rather low GDP rate. It's not clear a healthy middle class and consumer based economy is sustainable at low to zero growth rates. I guess Japan is leading the way.If you ask me, the answer is renewable energy and private space exploration.</comment>

<comment>What is so great about GDP?</comment>

<comment>Unlimited growth is a Ponzi scheme.</comment>

<comment>Shorter: Who cares about life, what about my video game?  Spoken like a third-grader who hasn't done their homework.</comment>

<comment>Indeed. The border region of Texas is practically a new Singapore.Your support for mass immigration conflicts with your pretend-support for higher wages.Your support for mass immigration also has a negative impact on sending countries, depriving them of the human capital *they* need. You're like a modern-day colonialist except instead of taking their minerals you take their people.</comment>

<comment>Your argument has some merit. However, I'm not in favor of mass immigration. Just enough to keep us a smidge over replacement levels.</comment>

<comment>We are the ones who should be selecting the immigrants we allow into the country. What we have today is an immigrant population that we do not control, and it is a disaster.</comment>

<comment>Why do we need replacement?  Because you're entitled to 3% growth forevar, and if you can't get it from whipping the slaves harder, and making them breed is beyond the pale, well, The Numbers Must Be Respected?</comment>

<comment>Then their home countries should grant them the safety and opportunity they seek.I believe that people willing to leave their homes are more motivated by survival rather than opportunity.</comment>

<comment>Vapid, contradictory nonsense.  You want wages to go up, but refuse to curtail immigration, because of your sentimental attachment to it as an unassailable good.  Your idea of a robust economy is one of people maximally spending, environmental realities be damned.  You are a perfect example of identity politics in service to neoliberalism.</comment>

<comment>Not really. I simply want working class Americans to have better wages. I'm not in favor of limitless immigration or mass consumption of junk. But we need some consumer spending, and our levels are depressed by low wages. We should address the other factors depressing wages. </comment>

<comment>So if you favor American workers having better wages then you should want to shut off low-wage immigration immediately and encourage people here illegally to peacefully leave.  We have under employment and a dearth of living wage jobs right now.  Black Americans are clearly the worst hit by this siatution.    You can't correct those problems while merely hypothetically being willing to limit immigration at some future date.  The only immigrants who are of value are innovators and other people who will create jobs directly as part of their professional activities, not merely as consumers.</comment>

<comment>First of all, who is this "we", and why are you objectifying me as capital?</comment>

<comment>Its potential. It's new ideas, it's the drive to preserve what is old and worthy of it, it's the desire to produce what is beautiful, it's the gift of harvest, it's the knack for repairing what's broken, the pull to explore, it's having a child, its investment, it's profit, it's the gain that only comes through grief and loss, and occasionally, it's just standing still and watching the moon rise a gigantic gold coin in the east. It's not all about making money, but the money comes from the growth potential, and it's a shame not to give the potential its full reign. This is especially true in very poor countries, where the drive and dynamism never reaches full potential because not enough children are educated and not enough business deals can get capital. But it's true here to a lesser degree. We're not at full potential. We can do better. It's not all quantifiable, human capital, but you can see when it's not taken full advantage of.</comment>

<comment>'Even if they couldn’t work in their professional fields in the U.S., they used their educations to set up institutions such as tutoring organizations and community centers to help their children do well....People in San Jose still seem committed supporting the community resources that help everyone succeed, Jill Bourne, the director of the San Jose Public Library, told me. The city just passed a library parcel tax to support the system for 25 years, and every time that the library unveils a class on coding or adult education or ESL, they fill up within hours, she told me.'We even have a public library here in my small midwest US town. I visit there frequently to check out books, read the periodicals, etc. They also have PC's with internet access for patrons. In just the past few years they had a big renovation project of the building that I donated some money to help finance. But whenever I've been there I have noticed that there are very few people visiting there. Meanwhile the poor people I know here in town, people who receive hundreds of dollars per month in food stamps, disdain that icky borrowing books from the library and reading them stuff in favor of playing video games on their xboxes at home and driving an hour away to the big city to shop at the malls every week.</comment>

<comment>Alana, you wrote all those paragraphs to tell us that Asians are more successful assimilators than Blacks?  earth shattering!</comment>

<comment>Why would we need to "assimilate"? We've been here for longer than most White people.</comment>

<comment>I don,t think that was the point of the article</comment>

<comment>My comment was no less germane than your needless dig at Black people.</comment>

<comment>WOW, facts are racist now if they dont fit your narrative.....</comment>

<comment>Bruh-bruh, what "facts"? You threw out a baseless comment about an unquantifiable phenomenon on an article that wasn't even comparing racial groups.</comment>

<comment>You nailed it, Julian. Bill had to find a way to bring Black people into so he could grind his axe. And by the way, Billy, immigrants' experiences in this country are not the same as the experience of Black Americans. Learn some history, not just the one that fits your narrative, and get back to us.</comment>

<comment>I'd prefer it if he didn't get back to us...but..you know...</comment>

<comment>"Learn some history, not just the one that fits your narrative"White paternalists like you should take your own advice.  While you are virtue-signalling with the latest Ta-Nehisi Coates screed, you consistently ignore non-black minorities who don't fit the narrative of 'white supremacy,' en vogue as a means of keeping blacks from seeing their plight in class terms.</comment>

<comment>You don't know what you're talking about but I'm pretty sure you're too arrogant to realize that. If you really are Korean, KoreanKat, spare me the lecture on the black experience. I know so much more about it than you ever will. I'm a Black American, many, many generations deep in this country. Princeton educated, honors from grad school, lived in multiple countries, speak English, Spanish and Mandarin and have raised 3 children in a solid marriage for nearly 28 years. Oh, and I'm rich. Be humble enough to know what you don't know and maybe you'll learn something beyond what you've read in a textbook or heard around your kitchen table from other people who don't know what they're talking about either.</comment>

<comment>Well, your avatar makes you look white to me, but I'll take you at you word and apologize for judging you were white.Nevertheless you prove my larger point.  You are basically an exemplar of the global elite class that benefit by dividing working-class people with incessant identity politics.  You could scarcely be more removed from what is meant by the "black experience."Ta-Nehisi Coates rails against 'white supremacy' and here you are in every way, by your own admission, a foil to that simplistic bombast.</comment>

<comment>My point was they were comparing racial groups by comparing cities with vastly different racial compositions...  Its like saying people in Nebraska are better swimmers than Floridians because they drown less!!!</comment>

<comment>"My point was they were comparing racial groups by comparing cities with vastly different racial compositions..."Except the authors of this piece weren't doing that. They didn't make any specific comparisons of the racial demographics San Jose to any of the other cities mentioned in this article.</comment>

<comment>Oh you are difficult! I realize they made no such claim but looking at the list of cities my point was rather obvious....I thought!</comment>

<comment>Then you just keep on doing what you've been doing.  How's that working out for ya?</comment>

<comment>Meh. Could be better but, all things considered, it feels like things are looking up.</comment>

<comment>Your response is a chilidish non sequitur, but of course is wildly popular with the racial paternalists and cultural relativists around here.</comment>

<comment>.....And your point is?</comment>

<comment>Your lack of a rebuttal is noted.</comment>

<comment>Not much point in refuting someone who doesn't understand what a "non sequitur" is.</comment>

<comment>I understand perfectly well what a non sequitur is and your comment qualifies.  The length of time blacks have been in the Americas is irrelevant.  Some indigenous peoples have been here even longer and are also poorly assimilated to the dominant Western European-Enlightenment model.</comment>

<comment>We speak the dominant language, follow the dominant religion, and have adopted the dominant culture's clothing, and forms of recreation. Also, Black Americans are responsible for the creation of several cultural identifiers that are distinctly American. Do you just not understand what assimilation is, or are you just trolling?</comment>

<comment>Develop skills, get work, succeed.  Simple.  Railing against the system is not productive, nor is trying to cheat it.  Most people who don't like where they are in life are their own worst enemy.  Sorry if that makes you feel bad.  Denying reality is self-defeating.  You should have learned that already.</comment>

<comment>Bobby, you realize that "railing against the system" was how my people were able to help break a system of de jure and de facto racial segregation that curtailed our economic, political and civic rights, right? Meekly accepting your place in the world is no way to live.Also, you've got some weird ideas about life. "Most people who don't like where they are in life are their own worst enemy"? In my experience, the people who are dissatisfied with their lives are the ones who work hardest to change things. And why disparage people for "cheating" the system? America was built on exploitation and opportunism; if you're smart enough to finesse the system, more power to you.</comment>

<comment>I love how right-wingers of either major brand have this Protestant "Arbeit macht Frei" thing going on, as if they were not living in a society engineered for human exploitation "for the ages".Of course railing against the system isn't productive.  Psychopathic neoliberals can't even perceive work done that isn't for sale; in fact, they seek to stamp it out.You are not entitled to continue playing your bourgeois game, and nor do we have to.</comment>

<comment>Well look at it from this vantage point:  The unspoken part of the American Dream (but always inferred) is that you will always have native born African-Americans as your floor group.  You know the old Southern "At least you ain't a N....." To sustain you.  Except now, with globalization, that may no longer be a workable paradigm.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't know my people came here long before Blacks, we had Indians and Mexicans......</comment>

<comment>Sure it will!  That just means whichever faction of SW Asian people is under attack this week is the new floor group.</comment>

<comment>No difference in their immigration pattern? </comment>

<comment>Wow...was waiting for someone to bring us into this conversation! Lol! So obsessed with us! #envy</comment>

<comment>Actually, if you look at data from black immigrants, they tend to do very well.</comment>

<comment>it's not really about assimilation, asians are where we are because of pragmatism and money-seeking attitudesboth are frowned upon by the rest of america</comment>

<comment>and having a population IQ close to 2 standard deviations higher than Blacks doesn't hurt!</comment>

<comment>regardless of IQ tests, i think blacks would be more successful if their worldview was more money-orientedsame goes for anyone really</comment>

<comment>Have you ever listened to rap music?</comment>

<comment>Wow, I think I saw my first dyed-in-the-wool neoliberal evangelical.I hope people shut you out of their societies so that you can starve or flourish by YOUR OWN works rather than what you wheedled out of others.</comment>

<comment>I'm writing one sentence to tell you that you are a fool</comment>

<comment>You know this article would have a much more alarmist tone if it were European immigrants pushing out the historically Hispanic community there instead of Asians. Liberals shouldn't give gentrification a pass just because one minority group is doing it to another.</comment>

<comment>Is it just the Hispanic community that's being displaced, though? I'm unfamiliar with most things California, but from what I've read I was under the impression that low income Asian families are just as affected by the rise in the cost of living.</comment>

<comment>You would be correct.</comment>

<comment>Liberals WANT gentrification.  How else will they get the poor dependent on them and begging them for bourgeois etiquette instruction?</comment>

<comment>Because I see a lot of it happening here it is important to remember that the "model minority myth" has been demolished several times.https://secure-media.collegebo...</comment>

<comment>And watch as I demolish your study with 4 simple links from US government data that show they commit less crime, earn more money, are less likely to be unemployed, and have higher levels of education which I think pretty much confirms they are model citizens overall.1.  Asians have higher median weekly earnings than whites, blacks, and hispanics:http://www.bls.gov/opub/report...2.  Asians have lower unemployment than whites, blacks, and hispanics.http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/...3.  Asians have the highest rate of University education than all other races.  In 2014 among 25-29 year olds Asians had the highest rate of bachelor's or higher degrees and the highest rate of master's or higherhttps://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/...4. Asians have the second lowest rate of crime behind whites when accounting for their percentage of the general population (they make up 1.2% of the population and commit 1.2% of the crime).https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/c...</comment>

<comment>As explained in the study this is chiefly due to the high skills requirements for immigration. A selection effect.</comment>

<comment>You don't demolish the "model minority myth" by explaining why they outperform other minorities.  That is called re-enforcing.  Also, the explanation has profound impact in terms of immigration policy because I can show you Hmong and Cambodian war refugees that drag the Asian score down.</comment>

<comment>The myth has always been based on the assumption that Asians had some intrinsic characteristics which explained their "performance"It turns out it is just a function of how immigration works in general.</comment>

<comment>No, that is your own racism showing.  You paternalists confuse socialized cultural values with intrinsic, i.e. biologically-rooted, characteristics.  It says more about your ignorance of science or devotion to cultural relativism than anything.</comment>

<comment>Intrinsic does not imply biological. In this case neither are at work.</comment>

<comment>Actually it does imply natural or essential, i.e. biological.  You lack the integrity to admit you used the wrong word, if that was not your intention.</comment>

<comment>"late 15th century (in the general sense ‘interior, inner’): from French intrinsèque, from late Latin intrinsecus, from the earlier adverb intrinsecus ‘inwardly, inward."</comment>

<comment>You are confusing etymology with meaning.</comment>

<comment>You are confusing semantics with reason.</comment>

<comment>That makes no sense, but I'm amused seeing you ground down to babbling.</comment>

<comment>Damn dude, you are dumb.</comment>

<comment>Childish.</comment>

<comment>I don't think the 1 millionth restating of how Asians are a model minority needed a more complicated response than that.</comment>

<comment>For me, one of the worrying side-effects of this is the reluctance of many to acknowledge that there is a problem, perhaps feeling that white racism is to blame and that it would be racist to condemn the actions of such people for what they are.The subculture of people who feel alienated from wider, mainstream society is not a phenomenon confined to Blacks or to Muslims and seems to affect second-generation immigrants in particular. If you think back to the New York of the 1860s, you have the Irish gangs that terrorized the city. In the 1920s, their place was taken by Italian and Jewish thugs. In their place came Puerto Ricans and African Americans after the Great Migration. Now we have Russians and, I'm sorry to say, Albanians. In my part of the world, we have problems with the children  of Kashmiri and Mirpuri immigrants - and a more extreme difference between Kashmiri and Mirpuri, and British societies is difficult to imagine. On the West coast there are problems with the Hmong.</comment>

<comment>I'd suggest the problem is allowing culturally dissimilar groups with antithetical values to enter you society in the first place and drain its resources with anti-social behavior.  At some point you have to look at the entire world and decide certain groups of people cause problems absolutely everywhere they exist and you're not likely to be successful trying to fix whatever problems they have.  </comment>

<comment>That's precisely why they're here.  Bourgeois solidarity means stirring up the melting pot.  Proletarian solidarity means class consciousness.</comment>

<comment>Without dealing with culture and parenting these articles are meaningless.</comment>

<comment>It's kind of hard for poor people to thrive in an automobile-based society that lacks widespread public transit when they can't afford a car.</comment>

<comment>"Indeed, the streets of San Jose seem, in some ways, to embody the best of America."Especially if you like your America free of Americans.</comment>

<comment>Or of charm</comment>

<comment>Neoliberal Valhalla.</comment>

<comment>That headline pic is not a "neighborhood". It's an isolated, single-use, sub-division pod, accessible only by automobile. Do you see a corner grocery store or a pub or a barber shop? No. It's not a neighborhood.</comment>

<comment>So it's not NYC, Boston, Chicago or San Francisco or any other US city that had an entrenched downtown before the car became an ubiquitous consumer good?  Guess those are the only cities with neighborhoods.  It's very common in cities with zoning to have large residential areas that have only a a few of those things accessible by walking.  That doesn't mean those places aren't "neighborhoods," at least to those who aren't snobby or elitist.</comment>

<comment>So, in essence this nation has thrived on the chaos of other nations.  The middle and upper classes of Southeast Asia fleeing the reeducation camps and killing fields.  The well educated fleeing the ethnic cleansing campaigns of the Balkan conflicts.  Also the Sihk, Hindu, and Pakastani merchants and techies fleeing the sub-continent seeking breathing space.  Lest I forget, the Arab, Ethiopian, Nigerian, and Eritrean merchants who have cornered the Southeatern U.S. Gas/convenience store, Dairy Queen, and Baskin Robbins markets.  Classic immigrant stories.  Meanwhile, native born Middle and working class Black and Caucasian students major in Xbox, HALO, fighting, and mediocrity.</comment>

<comment>I look at pictures from the 20s and 30s of the soup lines and people are rail thin. Look at pictures like the one above of people at food pantries today, and they all are fat or obese. I will always open my heart to feeding a hungry person but I do wonder if this is real hunger they are experiencing. It takes a lot of calories to stay that fat.</comment>

<comment>There have been significant changes in agriculture, food production and food distribution since the 1920s and 1930s. The cheapest, most easily available foods are stuffed full of empty calories. It's not a leap for an overweight person to be hungry or lacking nutrients.</comment>

<comment>Blather.  Healthy food is very reasonably priced.  it just doesn't taste as good.</comment>

<comment>Nope, not usually. Orwell has a great passage about that.I had actually popped back because I realized I had missed the other driving factor of the obesity epidemic, which is exercise. Daily life used to involve a lot more physical activity.</comment>

<comment>Yes, daily exercise nowadays for these people are finger flicking on a game of Candy Crush.</comment>

<comment>So all of the fat middle class and up people are fat why?</comment>

<comment>Jesus, pick up a history book. Daily life has gotten steadily less taxing as food became cheaper and a larger variety of unhealthy food became available at more hours of the day. Sure, a disciplined person can avoid gaining weight by diet and exercise, but eating a diet of bread and vegetables with some meet and getting plenty of physical activity used to be the way virtually everyone lived because they had no other choice.</comment>

<comment>There out to be weigh-ins and BMI tests at food pantries... if you're overweight, you don't eat. You can live off your fat, like a camel, until you slim down to a normal human size.</comment>

<comment>"You can live off your fat, like a camel, until you slim down to a normal human size."I don't think that's biologically possible.</comment>

<comment>Because, of course, the only thing the human body needs is CALORIES?  Because, of course, expensive junk like vitamins are just spices and the poor should eat bland as befits their station?Not enough lamp posts in the world...</comment>

<comment>A good cause is probably that there's corn syrup/other sugar products/highly refined starches (basically sugars)  in everything nowadays.</comment>

<comment>Maybe this is an artefact of the data Chetty used? According to the article, Chetty measured what percentage of people made it into the top 20% nationally. But maybe it's easier to make it into the top 20% nationally in San Jose than Detroit just because incomes are higher? It could be that the percentage of poor kids in San Jose end up in the top 20% of San Jose residents is the same as the percentage of poor Detroit kids that end up in the top 20% of Detroit residents.Using Chetty's measure to compare countries, we shouldn't look at what percentage of poor people that make it to the top 20% of their respective country, but instead a uniform global benchmark--say $100k. Under this measure, the US would probably have much higher social mobility than Denmark just because we have a lot more people who earn $100k+ so it would be easier for a poor person to get one of those slots. I'm not sure that's the right way to think about social mobility.</comment>

<comment>"San Jose, in the heart of Silicon Valley, used to be the best place in the country for kids to experience a Horatio Alger, rags-to-riches life."Does that mean they used to get hit by techies driving testlas and get rich? </comment>

<comment>This story would be the exact opposite if oil was the big income producer.</comment>

<comment>Of course.  Big Oil is a member of The Other Coalition, and like good schizophrenics it's very important that people keep good Bigness and bad Bigness in their containers.</comment>

<comment>"This is a city of immigrants—38 percent of the city’s population today  is foreign-born"And a large percentage of those immigrants are illegal aliens from the poverty mills of Latin America.

<comment>No, its mainly Asian now, although the Latino underclass remains on the east side.</comment>

<comment>" . . . more people moved to the region but housing supply didn’t grow at the same pace, driving real estate prices up?"It's tough to grow housing supply in an earthquake prone, water deficient area, when there are no vacant lots left. Why do articles on housing costs never mention increasing population as the major factor? Would that be considered politically incorrect?</comment>

<comment>God forbid existing, lower-density housing be torn down to build more housing units on an acre. Can't have that. Those 1100-sqft, 3 BR/1 BA shacks from 1952 are historically significant!</comment>

<comment>Want to convince half a dozen neighbors to sell all at once?  Then you can deal with the remainders who will be furious that you are altering the neighborhood that they know and love.</comment>

<comment>One can tear down a SFH and replace it with 2-4 condos. Character of the neighborhood doesn't really change much. Happened all the time in my old neighborhood in DC.</comment>

<comment>Not in San Jose.  The lots are too small.</comment>

<comment>Ha.. Versus row houses in DC that have shared walls with their neighbors? I am sure it is do-able in plenty of San Jose (but yes, probably not politically feasible).</comment>

<comment>Ok - Now you've got me curious enough that I'm going to start looking for before and after pictutes or this in DC. I've seen the sort of conversions you just described in San Jose but they usually involve either at least 2 neighboring lots or they take an already big house and split it into multiple units.</comment>

<comment>yeah, they take a big house (but almost no yard) and break it up in to single floor units. A friend of mine lives in a two bedroom condo in a building that used to be a large SFH, but is now a building with 4 two-bedroom condos (3 floors above ground, one basement unit). Another popular technique is to add a floor on top. Sometimes the builder does a good job in blending it in with the area, and sometimes it has really sticks out.</comment>

<comment>So, your answer is higher density housing? Are you a developer?</comment>

<comment>rusholmeruffianSince when is a 1100 sq foot, 3 bedroom house a "shack"?  I have nothing against large houses.But maybe part of our modern day housing problems in this country is that so many people will only buy a house that is more than 3,000 sq feet large?.</comment>

<comment>If you've seen most 1945-55 houses of that size, "shack" is a fairly accurate descriptor. The construction quality generally was poor, the layouts awkward and cramped, and the aesthetics appalling--oh, and they're astonishingly energy-inefficient.There's plenty of room for dwelling units in the "missing middle"--small multifamily structures with 400-600 sqft per occupant. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to build these in established neighborhoods because of aggressive anti-density politics. So, what ends up happening is that houses that once held working-class families of five now are owned by affluent DINKs.</comment>

<comment>Nobody who's anybody said anyone HAD to breed.</comment>

<comment>"Indeed, the streets of San Jose seem, in some ways, to embody the best of America. It’s possible to drive in a matter of minutes from sleek office towers near the airport where people pitch investors on ideas to cul-de-sacs of single-family homes with orange trees in their yards"Funny, I turned down a job near San Jose and took one in LA because I cannot stand that sterile office park, shopping mall, residential dead-end architecture.</comment>

<comment>Quality of life is not measured in GDP and income statistics.</comment>

<comment>So you went to LA???  Talk about fleeing the frying pan and ending up in the fire.</comment>

<comment>Orange county and the valleys are similar to San Jose, but the beach cities, Hollywood, Miracle Mile, KoreaTown, Silver Lake, Los Feliz, Echo Park, Culver City, etc. have a lot more character.  Everything jumbles together, old and new, residential, commercial, retail.  Very few of the cookie cutter national chain restaurants.  Few manicured office "parks."  Streets in old-style grid, not winding dead ends.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  Not seeing how LA is an improvement.</comment>

<comment>I tend to agree with you although I probably dislike most of SoCal far worse. You needed to go a little farther out from San Jose IMO but the commutes can be bad. South towards Santa Cruz even Morgan Hill. East to Pleasanton, Livermore, or North to Petaluma are all pretty nice and not particularly sterile. A lot of it has to do with when the growth occurred in the area. San Jose just unfortunately got most of theirs in the 60s, 70's, and 80's with the 70's being the worst IMO.</comment>

<comment>Hate to ruin your perception of San Jose but there are nice neighborhoods and communities all around places like...Willow Glen's wonderful neighborhoods with 30's & 40's  Spanish style homes and restored bungalows canopied by palms and cypress trees. The wonderful Rose Garden neighborhood oak tree lined streets, The Mid-Century Modern Eichler neighborhoods in Cabrian Park area, perfect California Americana, The Eastern foothills Hillcrest neighborhood at the foot of Alum Rock park could stand in for Beverly hills or Brentwood, yes many are newer Mediterranean styled cookie cutter sub-divisions like South east sides Silver Creek Favorited by 49rs and Sharks professional sports stars. More recently the subdivisions are giving away  to higher density loft styled condos in up and coming area like Japantown, The Alameda & Midtown. Many young professionals & techies are choosing urban living in new residential Hi-rises in Downtown 4 built in last few years and 5 under construction or in the pipeline now. I'm not even counting San Jose's suburbs of quaint Cambell, Los Gatos, & Saratoga, so it is not all bland office parks and strips malls but we do have plenty.</comment>

<comment>I was mostly reacting to the aspects the author seemed to find appealing.  I'm sure San Jose has some awesome neighborhoods or nobody would have been singing "Do you know the way to San Jose?"  I stayed in the Hotel De Anza once and that was pretty cool.  I also stayed in a motel on El Camino Real and that was pretty crummy.</comment>

<comment>At a glance I notice cities on top have a demographically disproportionate amount of Asians and the cities on the bottom have a demographically disproportionate amount of blacks, leading me to suspect it probably isn't the cities themselves that have much to do with economic mobility so much as the attitudes and values of them people in them...For instance San Jose is 32% Asian and only 3.2% black, while Atlanta is 0.2% Asian, but 54% black.http://quickfacts.census.gov/q...http://quickfacts.census.gov/q...</comment>

<comment>Shhh.  This is a safe space.</comment>

<comment>This is because Asians are largely (not universally) the offspring of high skilled immigrants. They have to be the "cream" so to speak to even reach the US.https://secure-media.collegebo...</comment>

<comment>Did not realize the Vietnamese boat people had all been engineers, doctors, and lawyers.</comment>

<comment>"not universally"Refugees are also discussed in the linked study</comment>

<comment>You would be surprised how many were.</comment>

<comment>Not all the Vietnamese who came were boat people. The elite of South Vietnam all fled in 1975, and many of them on airplanes. Since elites were the first targeted for the reeducation camps, they had the greatest incentive to get the hell out once they got out of the camps.The Vietnamese who got to the US may not have had anything more than the clothes on their backs, but they also had the educations in their heads. Compare this to the Hmong, who were mostly illiterate, and by and large have not gotten far out of poverty.</comment>

<comment>And why do Asians have "education in [our] heads" when we arrive?Could that be because of constant emphasis on education?  A cultural value not equally shared?</comment>

<comment>Well no because the same is true of other immigrants.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely absurd to suggest other cultures emphaize education to the same extent as East Asia.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely absurd to suggest that "east asia" is a culture.</comment>

<comment>Wow, you are desperate to deny reality.  East Asian societies very much shares a common root in classical Chinese civilization.  This isn't controversial in the least, but your race narrative demands cultural relativism at all costs.</comment>

<comment>Well Korean cat. You head on over and tell the some Koreans they are culturally Chinese. Tell me how it goes.</comment>

<comment>Koreans already know that.  If you weren't so ignorant of Asian history, you would understand it is not controversial.  Even in more nationalistic Japan, they acknowledge the Chinese roots of much of the society.  Your view is like suggesting a modern French citizen would have a tantrum over pointing out the Roman roots of their society.</comment>

<comment>I am suggesting that sharing roots does not mean sharing a culture.</comment>

<comment>Sigh.  Are you you really that obtuse?  No one, except the strawman in your head is suggesting they  have identical cultures, but that does not mean there are not real and meaningful cultural similarities.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure what you think you are accomplishing with the insults and the hand waving. You have yet to either discredit my original claim or provide any basis for your own.Did you figure no one would notice?</comment>

<comment>Wow, you are piece of work. The only one hand-waving is you, trying to desperately dismiss any sort of cultural factors to push your pure racial line. </comment>

<comment>The "education" emphasized in East Asia is rote learning of the sort needed to pass the Imperial civil service exam. Lao Tse notwithstanding, there's very little emphasis in the Confucian tradition on encouraging critical thinking.</comment>

<comment>Wow, the racism of the 'anti-racists' strikes again.Your dated stereotype is belied by the innovations, peer-reviewed publication volume, and international testing in subjects like reading and math that cannot be memorized.You paternalists just nurse anti-Asian bigotry because cultural values having disparate outcomes is grave threat to your orthodoxy.</comment>

<comment>If you think math and reading "can't be memorized," you're deeply mistaken. Formulas can be memorized. Vocabulary words can be drilled in. What can't be memorized is critical thinking skills--and as I've seen from working with countless products of Korean and (mainland) Chinese schools in the course of attending an Ivy for undergrad and a leading private research university for grad school, these aren't taught at all. (Not that all but a relative handful of the most progressive American schools do particularly well on this count, mind you.)For all its faults, the Soviet Union did education exceptionally well. At least at the schools serving the top quartile or so of the population, students were expected to have a solid understanding of the underlying concepts and be able to apply critical thinking to them. This is why Russian STEM professionals are so sought after.</comment>

<comment>I'm seeing a trend of running into highly educated young people who absolutely cannot connect dots. They take fabulous notes and probably do well on standardized tests but absolutely fail when assembling disparate but related facts. While I'll admit that several of the individuals are Asian I suspect it's more of a teaching method than anything racial. The Anglos with the same problem went to heavily Asian schools and probably picked up the learning style.</comment>

<comment>All learning requires some memorization.  It is important.  You were putting Asian education in scare-quotes and suggesting primarily  rote memorization.  If you personally had critical thinking skills you wouldn't hold the Critical Race Theory-rooted views that you appear to. </comment>

<comment>No, because there are plenty of uneducated Vietnamese back in Vietnam. (Common saying among US soldiers during the Vietnam War: "5000 years of civilization and all they've got to show for it is two buckets of s*** on the end of a stick.")</comment>

<comment>We brought in Hmong and Cambodian war refugees who certainly aren't the cream of any crop.  In fact they're the reason why little Wausau, Wisconsin has a gang problem.</comment>

<comment>Yes, this makes my point does it not?</comment>

<comment>You are the same person who though reparations for Japanese internment had been fair and meaningful, showing you have zero credibility on Asian issues.Naturally you ignore the fact that Asia can produce "high skilled immigrants" because it has the right societal values in place.  The elephant in the room is that you racial paternalists do not want to confront the reality that not all cultural values lead to successful outcomes. The Hmong, cited below, are perfect example of a culturally-entrenched group that has had a rough time in the U.S.</comment>

<comment>Feel free to quote exactly what I said on the matter. Needless to say it bears no relation to your characterization.In fact high skilled immigrants arrive in the US from all over the world.</comment>

<comment>Said by you in defense of reparations for slavery:"Well they worked for Israel and for Japanese Americans so I guess the answer is because we haven't tried them?"Your gross ignorance of the substance and effect of Japanese internment reparations very much is relevant.You also failed to understand how reparations to Israel worked.</comment>

<comment>"Worked" as in they did not result in the nonsensical fears of social disintegration often associated in the public discourse with reparations. I think it's pretty clear I made no claims as to fairness.</comment>

<comment>See, you persist in petulant denial, unable to acknowledge what I pointed out to you during the original exchange, the most fundamental difference of all: internment reparations went solely to those who had directly experienced internment.I also pointed out to you the orders of magnitude difference in the sums involved, for which you had no answer either.</comment>

<comment>And that's why the neoliberal right wants them here.</comment>

<comment>Blacks--who are not exactly rare in the Bay Area, as you may have noticed--probably were redlined out of most of the subdivisions built during San Jose's explosive period of growth in the '60s and early '70s, though. Also, as with the aerospace industry down SoCal, many of the Silicon Valley firms were pretty racist in their hiring practices.Blacks came to Los Angeles, SF, and Oakland roughly 1920-1950 to work in things like automobile and tire factories, shipyards, etc., as well as the older aerospace plants in L.A. County (e.g. Douglas in Santa Monica and Long Beach, Northrop in Hawthorne, Lockheed in Burbank) and lived in segregated ghettos near them. The newer aerospace plants established in San Diego and Orange Counties after WWII were notoriously racist.</comment>

<comment>"[t]his ain't genetics"No one said it was, but once again the 'anti-racists' treat critiques of cultural values as racist, a defensiveness that only makes sense if you believe cultural values are somehow innate.</comment>

<comment>I gotta disagree with you here.  Racist people are going to use whatever means they have handy.  Yesterday it was genetics, today it's culture, the next day it's something else.  Surely you've heard how racist people described Asian cultures early in California's history?</comment>

<comment>Fear of racist sentiments becomes a bona fide paranoia at some point.  Just because people with racial prejudice can mask their prejudices with different ostensibly non-racist positions, does not delegitimize those positions.Racism is to some extent a natural product of human tribalism.  This self-righteoues, zero-tolerance zealotry I see here is profoundly harmful because it means you refuse to make economic choices, specifically on low-wage immigration, or level criticisms that might actually benefit black Americans in the long run.You need only contrast it with the way my feminism is derided by the ostentatiously 'anti-racist' contingent here.  I think your ally, SgtKonus, sexually propositioning me on a regular basis says it all about the gross double-standard at work and how 'anti-racism' is a religion in disguise.</comment>

<comment>When someone routinely shoehorns digs at people of color while using Asian culture as a cudgel I don't think it's a good forum for what the relative values of cultures are.  There are better fora for that.I'm sorry, but your comment about Sgt doesn't follow.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for confirming your double-standard on sexism versus racism.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about?  What you said doesn't follow.  Sgt behaving in a way you don't like doesn't discredit the idea that racism is bad, any more than MLK cheating on his wife means he was insincere about his goals on race.  Do you not think racism is bad?  If you do think it is bad, why is it hard to believe that other people think it is bad too?  And how do I have to answer for Sgt anyway? I have not seen his behavior toward you, I don't even think I've seen you two interact at all.</comment>

<comment>I've never said racism isn't bad.  I'm saying it is not a Satanic (no pun intended) level evil that validates the all-consumming paranoia that surrounds it.  Almost all people are given to tribalistic judgments.  You know that global elite black lady you upvoted below?  Well, the reason I said she was white is because she really looks white in her avatar.  I doubt I would make that mistake if white.But here she is Ivy League, wealthy, globe-trotter and she pushes the defeatist line of 'white supremacy' rather than looking at improving attitudes towards education, etc. in the black community, attitudes she had to eschew in order to get where she is.I just brought up Konus as an example of someone with whom you seem to in broad disagreement.</comment>

<comment>"the defeatist line of 'white supremacy' rather than looking at improving attitudes towards education, etc. in the black community, attitudes she had to eschew in order to get where she is."Hmmm, I am not black so I don't feel confident making a claim about what attitudes towards education are in the black community.  But I would hesitate to guess at which attitudes are pervasive, which she had to eschew, and I wouldn't want to try to lecture any community on what attitudes they had to correct. I mean, I know a great deal more about East Asian culture, and have my opinions on attitudes that I find self-defeating but I keep them to myself, because I don't know the context and I don't even know the goals of what other communities are trying to achieve.  Either way, I doubt even my OWN community cares to hear everything I have to say, let alone communities I don't belong to.  That's just the reality.</comment>

<comment>"I've never said racism isn't bad. I'm saying it is not a Satanic (no pun intended) level evil that validates the all-consumming paranoia that surrounds it. Almost all people are given to tribalistic judgments. "You know what though?  This is just ridiculous and frankly discredits everything you have said so far.  This country, in living memory, operated a real, functioning apartheid system.  It's not paranoia to think that a similar system can't be put in place today or that no one would try. I don't know if you're just not very familiar with American history or if you just don't care, but this is so wildly ignorant I'm really shocked you said it.  I've listened to you accuse me of all manner of bad faith and not being a good person but I've tried to converse with you because I thought you had interesting things to say. But to engage in this kind of whitewashing of American history is appalling, especially after claiming to want to help the black community, whatever that is.  So goodbye, I do not plan to waste any more time with you.</comment>

<comment>I haven't whitewashed any history. You are wilfully misinterpreting my comments about contemporary racism.  Itis paranoia, to the point of mental illness to think segregation is capable of making a come back in a nation that twice elected a black president, where tens of millions of foreign non-whites like my parents have moved since 1965. Is that really how you think deep down?And again you prove my point about the double standard with womens rights.  Women face far more misogynistic violence per capita than racist violence and face an actual attempt to roll back our reproductive rights to 1973, but you are shaking in fear that a neo-Jim Crow is possible.  Yet despite those things I do not actual fear a return of a stiffling patriarchy.</comment>

<comment>Nope, you have shown what you are.  You have spent the thread telling people that you are better than them because of your "culture".  Now you are suggesting I have a mental illness, which is a nasty way of talking in its own right, because I think segregation is capable of making a comeback when it has continued to exist to the present day both in law and in practice.  AND we have a leading presidential candidate running on a platform that includes deporting people by the millions. And you think it's funny to mock people for being concerned about that.Finally, you keep trying to claim that any expression of anger about racism means that I can't deal with womens' rights as well, as if these were zero sum issues.  Like I can't walk and chew gum at the same time, maybe on account of my culture?  Whatever, I don't care to waste more time trying to parse your undergrad insults and google "Critical Race theory" or whatever nonsense you want to throw at me.  I am done.</comment>

<comment>I do think you are potentially mentally ill if you believe there is a realistic chance of segregation being reintroduced."...when it has continued to exist to the present day both in law"The fact you don't specify or support this claim is the paranoia and narrative-driven irrationality of you position in a nutshell.  No lawful segregation exists.  Pockets of racial prejudice, which is not the same thing as segregation exist, and should be challenged, but your histrionics actually harm the cause.I didn't say I was better than anyone else.  I said Asians are more successful both in Asia and abroad because of cultural values conducive to success.  I don't even think that is entirely a good thing, as it means complicity with global capitalism." that includes deporting people by the million"That is an entirely different subject.  People illegally in this country can, in theory, be deported.  The fact you bring that up is just more evidence of how irrational you Critical Race Theory fanatics are.</comment>

<comment>Except we aren't discussing why an area has the demographic makeup it does, we're discussing why San Jose and San Francisco have better income mobility than Detroit and Atlanta.  It just stood out to me that both the top two mobility places have ridiculously higher concentrations of Asians than the Country as a whole does (1.2%) and the two least income mobile places are majority black in a nation that is under 14% black.  Since Asians have higher levels of education and earnings than blacks that seemed like it might be worthy of analysis.  </comment>

<comment>The "attitudes and values" lol.   Code for "blacks tend to have low IQs."</comment>

<comment>I was referring to the fact that about 70% of black children group up in single parent homes, black educational attainment lags other groups, and the categories they do lead are bad ones like highest unemployment, highest percentage of welfare usage relative to population percentage, and most violent.  By hey, dismiss those points using whatever straw men you want.  I don't live in the city anymore so it doesn't matter much to me.</comment>

<comment>You seem to think  I was attempting to argue with you.   "Attitudes and values" is MY code for that lol</comment>

<comment>I don't know that we necessarily agree all that much if you think this ultimately comes down to IQ.  IQ is largely genetic and I think the real problem isn't a lack of intelligence so much as it is a lack of intelligent choices that are related to not being taught better values and ethics plus a degenerate culture that glorifies certain kinds of stupid choices.</comment>

<comment>"...I think the real problem isn't a lack of intelligence..." ^Lol -- okaaay, have a nice day.</comment>

<comment>You could get the same result on a statewide basis based on their white Southern Baptist proportion....</comment>

<comment>Personally, I think a better measure is the percentage of kids starting at the bottom who make it to the middle, which is doubtless a statistic in which San Jose, which I proudly call home, shines.  Rising rents *are* a problem, but one has to understand that much of the affluence in the Valley is due to the hard-working immigrants who purchase an additional home (or two or three or twelve) and then rent them out.  So blaming lack of opportunity on rising rents is only half the story.Inequality, as discussed here, is driven not by people sinking to the bottom but rather the stratosphere becoming ever-more stratospheric, I should think.</comment>

<comment>Case in point:  "Her parents paid $25,000 for their home in East San Jose in the 1970s; today that home is worth $600,000."  So.....Her parents, presumably retired, could sell out and pocket $550K after expenses, which is a lot better ROI than they would have gotten in Dallas or Mexico, most likely.</comment>

<comment>Gosh, in what way is the poor population of cities like San Jose, San Francisco and Salt Lake City different from the poor population of cities like Detroit, Atlanta and Baltimore?Any guesses?</comment>

<comment>Once again, government policies encouraging the export of manufacturing to China has hurt us. High corporate taxes sound like free money from bad people, but they drive our industry away. It really is better to collect taxes from people with jobs than send all the jobs somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>Bingo!</comment>

<comment>This isn't rocket science. The tech driven economy is good, giving opportunity for more people (not just immigrants), and the immigrants, now primarily from Asia, are smart and driven and skilled, and their kids are likely to be also.The inequality is a function of the disappearance of good paying low skilled union jobs due to offshoring, manufacturing, and illegal immigration. (wafers and microchips were once actually manufactured here, not just designed).But there is more to life than economics, the area, which I grew up in, has been transformed, from a wonderful orchard filled, delightful place with plenty of open space, to an ugly overdeveloped crowded place, with 1.5 hour commutes very common.And its running out of water as the drought continues apace.Most of the extra income is taken up by housing and rent, which is how a positional good works.Infrastructure has lagged and is falling apart and trash regularly fills the highways and roads, where once it was clean and nice. Quality of life, not measured in per capita GDP, has plummeted.But we got our iPhones!</comment>

<comment>That's the problem.  We need to bring back of good paying low skilled jobs.  Not everyone can be a web designer or have a career in IT.   Imagine if iPhones were manufactured in the USA.</comment>

<comment>Not going to happen.  If that's your plan for dealing with low skill people, you'd better find another one.</comment>

<comment>We do need more manufacturing jobs.  We need to build more things here and we also need to teach kids trade skills.  People can learn new skills but not everyone can be or wants to be techie.</comment>

<comment>Then you best vote for Trump.  He's the only candidate who wants to impose trade embargoes on China.Bad idea, in my opinion, but it's the only way those jobs are ever coming back.</comment>

<comment>I do support Trump.   I don't understand why you think its a bad idea to allow the creation of jobs and to have people to earn a decent living. </comment>

<comment>Not the response I thought I'd get.  Fair enough.  You have a coherent political philosophy, different than mine, and I can respect that.If I vote for Trump, it will be because he promises to reform the immigration system.  I'd rather have fewer low skill people in the country, than create jobs for them here.  </comment>

<comment>Santa Clara County had about 165,000 manufacturing jobs throughout the second half of 2015, according to http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.ca_...</comment>

<comment>The jobs aren't "low skilled," but this is exactly what Germany has been excelling at for decades. Their medium sized manufacturing companies train their own employees, very well, starting during high school, and as a result they make the best quality machine tools and cars and such in the world, so they can charge the most, so they can pay good wages, so not-Cal-Berkeley-material citizens can still live a good life. But it takes a real commitment to one's own citizens, including schools and health care, and a long time horizon, not a culture of move-the-factory-to-the-cheapest-workforce like American capitalism has turned into.</comment>

<comment>There are some other factors in the German success. One is they haven't abandoned vocational education as the US has along with idiotic notion that every child should go to college. Second is a cultural predisposition to quality that the Germans/Swiss have always been known for. Even under the worst days of the Iron Curtain the East Germans were to the quality supplier for the Eastern bloc despite the lack of good incentives. Third is the Euro has allowed Germany to keep the pricing of their goods artificially low.Interestingly we have a German firm opening a mfg facility here in town because they can get quality employees at what they consider to be a reasonable cost.</comment>

<comment>Which, ironically, is exactly what made San Jose great: Semi-conductor manufacturing. Neighboring Los Gatos was home to what would become United Defense, and manufactured armored personnel carriers. Neighboring Milpitas housed a Toyota factory, where Teslas are now made.</comment>

<comment>When I was growing up in San Jose in the 80s a substantial minority of the poor were refugees. These people were prosperous where they came from and had no bad habits to unlearn.  They may not have had many opportunities but their children did and they knew how to teach those kids how to take advantage of them.  The guy from Yugoslavia whose bleeding father reminded him that he could be like they were back in the old country was a perfect example of this. </comment>

<comment>I grew up there in the 60's. You missed the orchards and beauty of it all...just subdivisions now.</comment>

<comment>I used to see lititle patches of orchards.  They told me to look at that and imagine it stretching for miles.  Now I can't even find the patches to show my kids.</comment>

<comment>Yup, the biggest thing holding back the poor isn't a lack of money--in many cases, after all of their welfare benefits are added up, they end up with the equivalent of a lower middle class salary. The real thing holding them back is their own culture. When you have five kids living with a single parent who's never known anything but getting a government check, and the neighbors are all in the same boat, kids are going to have a hard time picking up the habits needed to have a successful life.</comment>

<comment>This might be true, but it is not the case in San Jose. It is not a good place to be poor. The families you describe no longer live here.</comment>

<comment>San Jose's demographics and real estate inflation sounds like a mini-VancouverGood</comment>

<comment>It's a shame.Bill Clinton's favorite, "globalization" and "open markets" is what happened to not just this place, but the whole country.  The rich have never been richer, but jobs all left here (Clinton signed GATT and NAFTA), banks committed fraud when Clinton signed the repeal of Glass Steagall, and so on.A total paradise for CEOs such as the Silicon Valley types, who then take the money they made off us, and donate it to other countries, not to where they made themselves and their money - the U.S. of A.</comment>

<comment>You don't live in San Jose do you? There is very little unemployment here. Plenty of jobs, people making good money. The only catch is housing. Very expensive. So there is a point in complaining about that. Poor people can not afford a decent life here. But this is more due to local politics than GATT NAFTA and so on.What exactly is a shame?</comment>

<comment>Well, that's not the case in the rest of the country.  Thank Bill Clinton for that.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Americans know what's coming. But if you have lived in Asia as I have you know. The US is becoming like many Asian nations.

So, here you go. Enjoy. But don't complain about rising poverty because this is what you asked for. </comment>

<comment>We need to import more poor people.</comment>

<comment>Nah.  Just make poor people here by taxing income at 100%.</comment>

<comment>"San Jose used to have a happy mix of a number of factors—cheap housing, proximity to a burgeoning industry, tightly-knit immigrant communities—"I respond:The last "good factor" - tightly knit (ethnic, racial) immigrant communities is something that is overwhelmingly resisted or attacked by the political cultural elite in this country - especially if these communities are White European ethnic communities like Italian, Polish, Lithuanian - to a lesser extent Irish American communities. These are communities where people know their neighbors and share common culture, where their are adult leaders, where children and teens are not allowed to do whatever children and teens want to do which usually does not mean going to bed at a decent time, dressing appropriately saying "yes mayem and no sir" to teachers and cops.There used to be lots of tightly knit Black African American communities that were also safe, upwardly mobile - but then we got the Great Society welfare state, endless campaigns to blame all of the problems in poor Black communities on White Racism, White privilege.These Vietnamese immigrant communities in San Jose seem to have done just fine without the racial grievance industry trying to adopt them.</comment>

<comment>^This! Short being born rich, the biggest advantage a kid can receive is living in a stable home with two parents who set high expectations.  The second biggest advantage is living in a community where your peers' parents also set those expectations. If we want the poor to be upwardly mobile, we have to stop making so many excuses for their failures, and instead focus on fostering healthy attitudes and close knit communities.</comment>

<comment>I lived in San Jose for about a year a decade ago and the problems outlined here were evident back then.    Unless you are making $100,000 or more a year you really can't live a comfortable life.</comment>

<comment>It's like that in a lot of places besides San Jose.</comment>

<comment>True, the entire Bay Area has become expensive.    I was working in San Jose making a decent income but I couldn't find a reasonably priced house in any of the surrounding areas.   I had no desire to commute from Santa Rosa, Gilroy or Oakland so I left.    It's too damn hot there in the summer anyway and the traffic is awful.</comment>

<comment>Over run by illegal aliens</comment>

<comment>Another city ruined by democrats</comment>

<comment>San Jose's city government is actually one of the best run in the country.But thanks for playing.  Keep saying that in the comments on any article about a city. Since almost all city governments are run by democrats you will always get to blame us.</comment>

<comment>The problem is the article tracks what happened to poorer children in San Jose and the success they've had without recognizing that this is unlikely to happen in the future because the environment has changed. I'm not assigning good or bad to it but it's been a natural progression that happened to other parts of the bay area.I grew up just a little bit North in Fremont from the 70's through the middle 80's and we lived there because my parents were priced out of Oakland in the 60's. During that time there were lots of well-paying middle class jobs in manufacturing and construction. In fact the local autoworkers were mostly paid better than a lot of college educated professionals. Tech and Defense were also big employers and without a college education you could afford a house and live a decent lifestyle.What's happened now is somewhat of a natural progression. GM closed it's auto plant early due to cost savings and it didn't help that the local was known for wildcat strikes and poor quality. Tech started moving mfg out due to costs first to the Valley (Roseville), other states and then overseas in fairly short order. Defense got whacked in the early 90's and what was left was the white-collar jobs. Those stayed because there was a good supply of college graduates, the weather is good, and it's a great location. The guys running these companies also have a similar outlook and background to the folks doing the white-collar jobs that work them.Of course people complain about the housing prices and that's always been the case. As I mentioned my parents moved to Fremont in the 60's because they couldn't afford Oakland. That's continued and the less affluent have moved farther out. Some of my high school class ended up out in Livermore with a lot more further out to the Valley or out of state. The big difference is that the good manufacturing jobs didn't go with the population shift. The valley is still about AG with some distribution centers but doesn't have a lot of good jobs locally so the commute is hell and getting worse. Avoiding that commute has upped the prices on anything close and there's less land and less will to build on it close to San Jose. That's not going to change short of tech truly imploding and going elsewhere. Add to that even more people coming into the area for the jobs, etc.All this leads to the huge gap that used to be filled by the middle class. It was that lack of a gap that kept schools up and created an atmosphere where the smart poor could rise. I don't see that happening anymore as a rule. The environment just doesn't encourage it.</comment>

<comment>Then, in your opinion, what's the future for the Bay Area?</comment>

<comment>Oakland is the next big growth area despite a horrible city government and crime issues. It's too well located to not have it happen. The kids of the less affluent will continue to move further out and eventually some more jobs will move with them. The major thing slowing it down IMO is prop 13 tax rates which mean older owners are less likely to sell and it lengthens the time before a house turns over. As the existing owners retire they will sell and it probably won't be for a rental.Even when the inevitable tech downturn hits I believe it will be short term. People are predicting a bubble bursting right now and the drop in foreign markets is having an effect but the money isn't coming from IPO's this time around and there's a tremendous energy to the environment.I also think people discount it but the climate, the tremendous amount of things to do close by (ocean, mountains, vineyards, city), the food, and the culture are enormously appealing to a lot of people. It's got a lot of warts too with traffic and expense but I drove to work today with top down looking at the green hills and the grapes are leafing out. There's enough people staring at ice for the next couple months who are tired of it or their kids are tired of it. And the bigger salaries are seductive even if the cost of living is high.</comment>

<comment>Another big problem in Oakland is all the subsidized Section 8 housing.  You can't throw a stone without hitting one.  Those places drive up crime like crazy</comment>

<comment>Good article. San Jose and the Bay Area are "the place" where everybody with some ambition is trying to make it. It is the Hollywood of high tech. Very few people were born here. Everybody came from somewhere. Even the non-immigrants. When we came from Vancouver Canada my daughter was in 9'th grade. First question she was asked at school was if she plans to go to college and what she intends to study. Good schools are extremely competitive. Suicides between high-schoolers due to pressure is not uncommon. We succeeded to get her in a good school but it did not come cheap. One needs to live in the right district were rents can be 2X compared to other districts just 2-3 miles away.</comment>

<comment>I would love to see data on regional library expenditures and their correlation with socioeconomic mobility. When I was 12, my family and I lived in a tent in the woods. The local library was my safehaven.</comment>

<comment>Social mobility has nothing to do with the problem....which is Rubio and his H1B bringing in foreigners to take over American jobs.</comment>

<comment>I honestly have never met a thriving poor person. Interesting choice of words. Must be a California thing.</comment>

<comment>People pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for those small houses crammed together like that! That's no place to 'move on up.' The burbs of southern cities are the place to go enter the middle class today, not California.</comment>

<comment>A place that is DYNAMIC and allows inhabitants to CHANGE their situation, WILL CHANGE.It cannot stay the same.</comment>

<comment>I can't read this without contrasting it to the suicides in the very same area. If you don't "make it," into Berkeley or MIT or Stanford, these kids seem to feel, especially if you had more family advantages than the really working class immigrants profiled here, you might as well just quit. That's the scary part of this dynamic that's not really explored much in this article. There's no room for error any more like there used to be.</comment>

<comment>That's a stupidly huge number of words to say that many people that grew up near Silicon Valley, got jobs in Silicon Valley...</comment>

<comment>I don't believe helping illegal immigrants become upwardly mobile is part of the social compact of any country in the world and to act if this is acceptable is disingenuous.</comment>

<comment>Like the Seattle suburb I live in, San Jose is a good place to get out of if you don't have lots of extra money. It will never get any better, because America's "glory days" are over.</comment>

<comment>"San Jose had social mobility comparable to Denmark’s and Canada’s"Denmark and Canada are far less popular with American migrants than America is as a destination for Danish and Canadian migrants.</comment>

<comment>Denmark is not looking for many migrants at all...  Canada is cold.  But by most measures of quality of life - they are higher than the U.S.</comment>

<comment>International migration figures are available at:"International Migration Statistics"http://www.migrationpolicy.org..."Immigrant and Emigrant Populations by Country of Origin and Destination"{Select country and migration direction at the bottom of the map then hover cursor over each country on the map to see the statistics.}Like America where 14.3% of the population are migrants, Denmark has a lot of immigrants (9%) from all over the world. For example, there are more immigrants in Denmark from Pakistan than there are from America.Migrants from the United States in Denmark: 12,000Migrants from Denmark in the United States: 34,000There are almost 3 times as many Danes living in America as there are Americans living in Denmark; but the population of the United States (320,051,000) is 57 times bigger than the population of Denmark (5,619,000). If Denmark had as many people as the US; then there would be 684,000 Danish migrants who had moved to America as opposed to only 12,000 Americans who had moved to Denmark. Both Sweden and Norway show similar preferences.If Denmark, Sweden and Norway was what most Americans preferred; then a lot more Americans would have moved to those countries.</comment>

<comment>Except migration numbers can never be static.  You can never say "if x country was y times bigger then it would be".  No - it doesn't work that way.  In any event - those are tiny countries.  Many Americans couldn't even identify them on a map.In any event - look at travel.  Mexico is a huge recipient of US visitors.  Does that mean Mexico is the most interesting place to visit?  NO!  Your thinking is too simplistic.</comment>

<comment>Travelling to a country is very different from moving to a country and becoming an official resident; so who is being simplistic here?  You want a big country?  Use the same site to compare migration figures from China to the USA vs Denmark:There are 2,247,000 migrants from China living in the US.There are 11,000 migrants from China living in Denmark.There are 12,000 migrants from the US living in Denmark.</comment>
