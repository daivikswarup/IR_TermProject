<comment>Clear proof that a STEM major pays off!</comment>

<comment>Lucky either way.  Geezers that never finished middle school make a living playing the numbers.</comment>

<comment>its not luck..its math...this was done by an autrailian company for 'Iowas?' lottery i believe...they won millions and millions of dollars copmpletely legally and the game they won is still active today</comment>

<comment>You play ?</comment>

<comment>This is one of the rare times when the saying "Lotteries are a tax for being bad at math" does not hold up.</comment>

<comment>They are still a tax on people who are bad at math - collected by people who are very good at math.</comment>

<comment>I'd just like to point out, there are no "clever roulette players" who outwit the casino...  Makes me wonder about the rest of the piece.</comment>

<comment>There used to be people who figured out the biases of individual wheels and bet that way.  The casinos got wise to this and now they will switch out any roulette wheel when they see someone doing this.</comment>

<comment>Hmm.. interesting. Thanks. And got better wheels, I imagine.</comment>

<comment>Why is it we celebrate those who choose to use their extraordinary talent and opportunities to game the lottery system rather than towards - literally - anything else. Ending poverty or cancer, finding solutions to global-warming, mass extinction and the other environmental catastrophes besetting the world, understanding the mysteries of the universe or the human mind - literally - anything else.Not only do many Ivy league students end up as hedge fund managers, speculators, corporate lawyers and in other such dubious-but-highly-remunerative careers - but more sadly, many seem to consider their facility at this sort of bullshit as a sign of their intelligence and superiority over the rest of humanity.But it is no surprise, since - for some strange reason - these are the qualities we admire.  Why try do something meaningful when you'll earn accolades for being shrewd and accomplished gamblers.</comment>
