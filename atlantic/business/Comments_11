<comment>Is this sarcastic?The 2014 median wage is: $28,851.21</comment>

<comment>An interesting article that briefly mentions a very significant structural problem, then walks away from further exploration of it, in favor of seeking new revenue sources..."In 2012, the mayor put a controversial pension-reform proposal on the ballot, saying he couldn’t cut services or staff any further. It passed, but was then challenged in court. Police and firefighters have agreed to pay cuts and staff reductions, and the city employs some 1,700 fewer people than it did in 2001,"This is possibly the largest single source of financial obligation, and it has increased as the public service retirees hit retirement age.And there is no real way around it except a mutually agreed-upon contract renegotiation, or bankruptcy.</comment>

<comment>It appears that the city is exploring both. This was alluded to in the article, and if you would like more information on the pension reform side of the budget equation, a simple query to the google returns this article, for instance, on how existing municipal employees are agreeing to pension reductions.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the link! I will examine it.As a former property owner in CA, I'm aware of how Prop 13 works. While it's apparent that San Jose has a shortage of revenue, until more evidence is presented, this is somewhat misleading (unintentionally, it seems to me):The "as long as the property was not sold" needs exploration. My gut feel is that many of the homes in SJ cycle thru the market more so than in Marin, for example, or Contra Costa. If this is true, the most recent market value, as determined by sales price, is the basis of the tax calculation, and therefore the revenues from this source are likely no more deficient than in any other CA city with similar housing price levels.If this is true, we need to look elsewhere for the problem.[EDIT]I just found this:If this is somewhat accurate, it implies to me that in the area of property tax revenue "shortfalls", the problem is: a) a lower-than-average number of relatively inexpensive housing units (the value of which is the basis for prop tax computation); and b) urban planning mismanagement with the bond-backed redevelopment projects.</comment>

<comment>indeed.  Even if only ~ 30% of the housing stock has been purchased since around 1999 (about 2% per year), the whopping price of homes generates quite a lot of revenue.  The problem is that this money goes to the county, not to the city.</comment>

<comment>The implication of the article is that it goes to the city, but the fact is (I think) that by whatever mechanism that San Jose receives property tax revenues, my guess is that it is the same as every other chartered city in the state. So if prop tax on homes in SJ goes to the country, then to SJ, I'd bet (maybe) that the same can be said for Palo Alto.</comment>

<comment>reading the blog post above, one couldnt help coming away with the idea that San Jose's budget problems are one of shrinking tax revenues.Per the City of San Jose budget office, one can go back an look at financial information -- as far back as 1999.Interestingly, since 1999 city tax revenues have grown at a compounded rate of just over 4% -- from $668 million in 1999 to $1.2 billion in 2014.      Over that time, the population has increased from 895k to 998k today, about 11.5%.    If you want to get true apples to apples --    the $668, adjusted for inflation and city population growth implies tax revenues in 2014 of about $1 billion.   The City receives ~20% more than that.This doesnt feel like a "lack of tax revenue" crisis ---We do know that the cost of the city employee pension and medical costs more:    $73mm in 2001 to $271m in 2014.   Thats $150 million more a year in costs than if that $73mm had simply grown at the same rate as its revenues.</comment>

<comment>You nailed it shut before I could comment. From San Bernardino to Detroit, public sector pensions are busting the budgets of state and local governments.Let San Jose residents pay 50% sales tax, and tell them the money is used to support lavish pensions for government workers.</comment>

<comment>"Lavish"50 percent for 20 years minimum of work that you can't cash out until 65 is 'lavish.'Okay then.</comment>

<comment>They worked for twenty years for that pension. How can you be so blasé about cutting their promised benefits?They passed up better jobs with better pay for the security of the pension.</comment>

<comment>Workers in the private sector were moved from pensions to 401K. The same will be true of public sector employees, who will have their earned benefits frozen and protected.</comment>

<comment>Not all. A cursory Google search shows some manufacturing jobs haven't done so yet.However, that's besides the point. They paid 8-10% of their pay every year for twenty years. We're promised that pension. Work towards eliminating them for the new generation coming if you want, but don't reneg on promises made.I get it: You didn't get a state job. I have a 401K and it hasn't moved in three years percentage-wise. (I'm 29.) Offsetting the responsibility for retirement from the employer to the employee hasn't been exactly effective, has it?</comment>

<comment>"You didn't get a state job."Yeah, you're right. My state wasn't hiring people with three degrees in chemical engineering, petroleum engineering, chemistry. So I was forced to get a real job.</comment>

<comment>YEOW!!!Excellent and convincing presentation.</comment>

<comment>Well done.The article obscures the point that the money must be going somewhere. The taxes aren't zero. And indeed they're pretty high.</comment>

<comment>and BTW:  this took me about 5 minutes in internet searchingMs Semuels:   this is a complete failure on your part ( as well as your editor's for that matter).there is an interesting story here:    the Gordian knot many cities have found themselves in --    having committed to retirement benefits they cant afford AND are in many cases Constitutionally guaranteed by their states.  At the same time, local residents have no interest in the level of taxation necessary to pay for current government services AND the retirement benefits.     Raise taxes too high, and people vote with their feet, making the fiscal problem worse.  Cut current services, and people vote with their feet, making the fiscal problem worse.Some localities apparently are going to let fate decide:   they are simply going to let the pension fund run out of money and deal with it then.Fascinating to see where this ends up.</comment>

<comment>Or, in other words, pension and medical costs have gone from 11% of the budget to 22%. I know medical costs have been inflating in general, but that's amazing.Unlike most of the folks here, I don't blame the workers for taking good pension deals; the whole thing with public-sector jobs was that you took lower pay in exchange for job security and benefits. Because it's as easy to improperly maintain a pension plan as it is to defer maintenance on infrastructure, we're in this mess.I want to really underline here just how much of a disaster the Great Recession was for pensions, sometimes very directly when those funds invested in "low-risk" CDO-type swindles. Like what happened to Cooper Union's free tuition fund; the people in charge made stupid, risky decisions, and now they can't fulfill their obligations.So, the music is stopping, and the question is, who gets the chair pulled out from under them? The state and local governments who can't keep their promises without significant service cuts? The retirees who were promised pensions as part of their compensation and dutifully did their jobs for all those years? There's no good answer here, it's certainly not as simple as "damned greedy public employees screwed us all", and the proposed solutions frequently don't solve anything.</comment>

<comment>It really bugs me that so many people demonize public sector pensioners. Thank you for acknowledging the sacrifice they made for the defined retirement security.Most of the animosity from the general public seems to be the fact that the private sector eliminated pensions for the most part.</comment>

<comment>It is the song, "Do you know the way to San Jose?"It brings in the homeless.</comment>

<comment>One of the reasons San Jose can't afford these services is because it's so rich. With land values as high as they are, it simply costs a lot more to build public housing for the homeless in San Jose than it does in Detroit. And you also have to pay your municipal workers a lot more.</comment>

<comment>Funny thing is San Jose isn't really rich. In Silicon Valley, it's one of the poorest cities. The average income is deceptive, because it's a bunch of Silicon Valley engineers making a lot of money (but not very tied to the community - usually renters), and a lot of working class and poor people. But when you average the numbers, it seems rich.Also San Jose is large - 49 square miles per Wikipedia. Vs 12 sq miles for Mt View. So there's a lot of infrastructure to maintain, a lot of kids to educate, etc.</comment>

<comment>San Jose is nearly 180 square miles if you include all the land it incorporates. It's population density is an anemic 5,600/sq. mile, which puts it out to very low-density; just a step above rural, given its "pioneering" urban sprawl. That makes it disperse enough that its per household maintenance cost is about $2,500; to compare, a city like New York is about $1,400.</comment>

<comment>I read it - no change in my comment...  I've lived there for 35 years so know more than what's in the article.</comment>

<comment>This might be the best comment ever on the whole inter web</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't a better option be up-zoning most of downtown and other nodes around major transit corridors and let property tax values grow that way? I mean, all we here about is how home prices are crazy high, and office space is in incredible demand. Make it easier for people to build, and build they will. Tax revenue can be had by solving a major social problem--affordable housing and office space.</comment>

<comment>A lot of people have moved out over the years (many businesses moved to Texas because it's less expensive to run), and more people move in all the time because the weather/location is probably the best in the world - so after almost 40 years, Prop 13 affects a lot fewer properties.  Prop tax is about 1% of home's value, and when homes may average $600K, a lot of tax revenue comes in.  I'd like to know cost of San Jose building projects - e.g. the "artwork" on the parking garage at the airport wasn't necessary at all.  If article follows what their rep says, a need for budget consciousness in SJ was no surprise.</comment>

<comment>Almost no businesses moved to Texas, other than the high-profile move of Toyota's US headquarters. California's employment losses for company relocation are about 1% of all losses annually. And we replace those jobs in spades. In 2014, for example, California had the most new jobs in the country -- nearly 100,000 more than its nearest competitor, Texas. At the end of 2015, California had created nearly 300,000 more jobs than Texas.</comment>

<comment>I'm in semiconductor and knew one large company that moved there maybe 15 years ago - others were doing same.  Texas said exodus from CA helped them (for workers, there's no income tax in Texas).  Search this "how many businesses left california during past decade" to see many articles.  But you're right about businesses/people getting replaced, which is my point because the houses sold to new owners provide more prop tax revenue.</comment>

<comment>Right, go search, that's your answer.</comment>

<comment>High tech jobs or Walmart?...I think the 300K number was inflated for political reasons. Sounds like good political rhetoric as is the nationwide unemployment numbers.  FYI we lost quite a few high paying jobs from Company moves to Texas.  1510   have fled to Texas since 2008-14.  That is the ones publicly announced however they estimate that the number is really closer to 9,000.  Do a GOOGLE on why businesses leave California.....an article I found clearly said "Governor Jerry Brown has made several public statements over the past few years DENYING  a “mass exodus” of California businesses.One article clearly said the huge increase in California jobs was the massive growth of Walmart and Costco.The fastest growing states for High tech jobs is "No. 1, Texas, No. 2, Florida, No. 3, North Carolina, and No. 4, Oregon. Notably absent from the top 10, presumably because Silicon Valley and the rest of the Bay Area are already staffed to the gills with tech workers: California, which has a technology workforce of 250,000".</comment>

<comment>A VAT (aka "gross receipts" tax), would be a fine idea at the California level. Problem is it's easy for smaller businesses, especially ones run out of one's home, to just move somewhere else and save the money.The "government taxes help because they create government jobs" mentality doesn't make much sense either:1) All the jobs are created off the existing tax base, unless there's going to be large infusions of fed/state money.2) All those jobs (firefighters, police, maintenance), etc., are going to be specialized skillsets, not in line with the majority of the unemployed residents. You're more likely to bring in people from outside city borders.They would be better off removing the cap on the business tax, which keeps the burden on the Ciscos and Adobes of the San Jose, not smaller and mid-size businesses.But really, all of California is fighting a losing battle against Prop. 13.</comment>

<comment>Ms. Semuels needs to make a much bigger effort to understand Santa Clara County and California economics, taxes, and services. There are some very significant answers there that she is not seeing.</comment>

<comment>California needs to raise property taxes.  If homeowners actually felt the squeeze of housing costs there, they might cut the NIMBYism and let some high rise affordable apartments and such finally be built, which San Francisco desperately needs.  Then housing prices might come back down into reality land and normal people might actually be able to afford to live in California again.  </comment>

<comment>You mean CA needs to overturn prop 13, which would allow property taxes to raise more "naturally" (for a lack of a better word). The rates themselves probably wouldn't have to change/rise.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that tons of elderly will wind up on the streets because they won't be able to handle the property taxes that will come after their house is worth thirty times what it was when they bought it in the 50's.The real problem is immigrants causing demand to skyrocket or buying up homes just to sit on or sock away their corruption money.</comment>

<comment>There are a couple solutions to that. A) Grandfather in the new rates B) Those of a certain age are exempt from the raise. I know DC has something along those lines for its property tax rates. And how are immigrants the problem if they're buynig up houses? New homeowners pay a lot more than the previous homeowners were for property tax.</comment>

<comment>Those are all well and good, but what about the issue of those old people? My uncle is a day laborer and is set to inherit my grandparents' place. He's making bare minimum wage and would not be able to afford the property taxes were it not for Prop 13. My great grandfather bought that land and built that house with his own two bare hands. How in the world is that fair?</comment>

<comment>Well now you're bringing up a different issue: inheritance. Look at the bright side, he could sell the house and buy somewhere else. But it really doesn't matter since Prop 13 isn't going away anytime soon.</comment>

<comment>The house and land are prized family heirlooms. We have decades of Christmases and special events there. Selling it off would be absolutely heartbreaking and unavoidable if property taxes were adjusted.Thank goodness Prop 13 is going nowhere. You don't mess with a man's land by threatening to price him out of it.</comment>

<comment>I feel for you. I honestly do. Prop 13 was put in place because people didn't want to throw old folks out of their homes. Kind of like how rent control is intended to prevent long-time residents from ending up on the street.But in both cases, we wound up with shortages, and skyrocketing prices for those who weren't grandfathered in. That avoided heartbreak comes at a terrible cost for the rest of us. Those of us who didn't score a rent-controlled apartment, and watch our rates climb every year; those of us who see the dream of home ownership grow further and further out of reach. It's heartbreaking for us as well.</comment>

<comment>Last time I checked, emotional elements were not part of economic policies. I'd love to inherit some family legacies with no tax consequences, but that's not how things work.</comment>

<comment>You are wrong, Ruby_Red.  There is a place for emotion and values in the political sphere, and we do not live under a tyranny of your reason.  Semuels writes of the influx of outsiders who have come here only for the tech boom and feel no sense of stewardship for our community.  The boom has only disrupted the entire community, which for the most part has seen only added hardship and little benefit from it.  Many families have been here for generations and deserve to keep their heritage, if they wish.  Abolishing Prop 13 would be devastating for them.  You are probably an outsider yourself whose insatiable lust for pillaging this place in entirety would leave no locals safe from your infinite, ravenous greed.</comment>

<comment>If by immigrants, you mean young graduates from MIT and Carnegie Mellon.</comment>

<comment>California needs to get rid of the socialist democratic politicians (which is highly unlikely) . Raising property taxes and burdening hard working property owners will not resolve the financial degradation of this state or every other socialist democratic State that is on the brink of financial collapse.   Perhaps an investigation into the massive welfare fraud and abuse of the social programs  may help in improving the financial picture  of those Cities and States.Increasing taxes is a typical social democratic mantra...a recent article just stated that 45% of Americans don't pay a nickel in taxes.  In other words, half of the American population who work and pay taxes are supporting the other half who don't.  Something wrong with that picture.  Maybe some focus can be directed to the 45%.  But frankly having lived in CA since the 60s I am not sure even that would help.  Way too many freebies to the greedies. Guaranteed Socialist Democrat  votes.Perhaps there needs to be an overhaul of the Voting system ...No welfare recipients/Prisoners/Illegals  voting..  Why should they get to vote on increasing the taxes of hard working AMERICANS who are providing those Welfare recipients a pretty good lifestyle with no effort on their part...when they don't pay any taxes.?  So perhaps some focus on the Social Welfare programs and the recipients might garner some savings. Oh I know I am dreaming there...But I am not sure even that would help since there is so much corruption in the voting system.So where are we?....Oh...that's right....lets raise the  taxes of  the working class & property owners. Welfare recipients are usually not property owners so no burden on them.   Yes that is ALWAYS the answer and has been for 50 years and where are we?  We are still broke....and who is running SJ and every other financially bankrupt broken down major city in the US...?? Take a guess ..bottomline it is the non contributing citizen & Unions that have more political power than the hard working contributing Taxpayer.So yes...let's just keep hitting them up for more taxes because they have no political power or representation.And before you all start carping at me, I was a young 18 year old  immigrant with no family from a socialist country, 1960 with 30 bucks in my pocket. I cleaned a lot of toilets.  Worked 2 and 3 jobs at a time up until midnight  to pull my self up by my bootstraps. Believe me it all begins with work ethic, pulling your own weight & moving from low income to middle class.  But perhaps a class in High Schools on the art of personal responsibility would help the next generation. But that would obviously never be allowed by Unions and their brainwashing of the next generation.I am a very appreciative naturalized American and love my country but sooner or later there has to be some review and accountability on nationwide Social programs.  Just the fraud and abuse on Obamacare should be a wake up call.</comment>

<comment>Baloney. The value of the land has been skyrocketing. That boosts revenues naturally. There's no reason to raise the rate too.</comment>

<comment>Maybe its the angle of the photograph? Or maybe its because im used to East Coast cities.?  But the top photo  of San Jose seems strange to me. There seems to be lots of large buildings in San Jose's  downtown. but very few small or medium sized ones.And judging by the photograph, there doesn't seem to be much traffic or pedestrians. I also don't see any small cafes,ectIt almost seems like Downtown SanJose  has a lot of large companies.But very few smaller companies  and/or stores,Downtown. And that once workers reach their jobs around 9am, that the streets are dead until 5pm . It's downtown looks more like a suburban office park than a "Downtown"Is this the case? IIm genuinly  curious? San Jose seems to have a good amount of large buildings downtown.But their main streets have almost no cars on them. I find that very strange[or maybe the photo was taken on a Sunday Morning?]</comment>

<comment>Downtown San Jose is kind of eerie. There is not a lot of business there - there is a convention center, and Adobe has offices there. There is also SJ University. But most of the office space is small business, and you can walk down the street for a block and see only closed offices. There's not much in the way of shopping other than small businesses. You don't see higher end stores, like a Lord and Taylor or an Apple Store.  It feels kind of sad and run down.</comment>

<comment>That's San Jose for you. A lot of cities in the West are like that.</comment>

<comment>Homelessness notwithstanding, there's no compelling reason for that encampment to look like a trash heap. Except for one possibility that I can think of: that any resident who took it upon themselves to try to clean the place up would feel at risk of being assaulted by some of the other residents, who would resent their efforts to improve the living space and view it as a personal judgement on their own neglect. Because that's how some people roll: they're more willing to expend energy intimidating other people to keep a miserable status quo in place than they are in lending a hand to improve it.That's the most plausible explanation I can come up with, anyway.</comment>

<comment>The encampment is gone.</comment>

<comment>Wait a minute - I thought the undocumented paid billions in taxes every year. Where did all their contributions to the till go?</comment>

<comment>To the undocumented..lol</comment>

<comment>If you're being serious, they pay most of the same taxes citizens pay, with the exception of federal income tax; they frequently pay federal payroll tax, and they definitely pay sales taxes, excise taxes, property taxes, and sometimes state income tax.The undocumentedness or not of the citizens of San Jose isn't an issue here; the city's revenue sources are sales and property taxes, and everyone living there pays that.(Santa Clara County has an estimated 180,000 undocumented immigrants in it, out of 1.8 million people total, so 10% undocumented. I couldn't find a more specific estimate for the city itself. The state as a whole is around 8%.)</comment>

<comment>For a picture of how dystopian this can get, look to Dubai. It is perhaps the wealthiest nation on earth, and boasts the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa.Yet, it can't construct a simple sewage system. When a toilet is flushed in the Burj Khalifa, it goes to a holding tank, and every day a line of trucks comes to pump out the sewage.Actually, Dubai does have the technical ability- in addition to money, they have the world's best engineers, and could easily create a world-class infrastructure tomorrow, if they chose.But what they don't have is an effective civic culture, one that has these trust and bonding necessary for shared responsibilities for public amenities. Its strictly every man for himself.So Rolls Royce limousines glide by starving immigrant workers, and fantastic works of engineering are served by a 14th century sanitary system.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm. Comparing a tribal, undemocratic Emirate dominated by Petro $ to a functioning city in Northern California seems like a bit of a stretch. </comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? There's plumbing in the Burj Khalifa.From Wikipedia:Plumbing systemsThe Burj Khalifa's water system supplies an average of 946,000 L (250,000 U.S. gal) of water per day through 100 km (62 mi) of pipes.[20][60] An additional 213 km (132 mi) of piping serves the fire emergency system, and 34 km (21 mi) supplies chilled water for the air conditioning system.[60] The waste water system uses gravity to discharge water from plumbing fixtures, floor drains, mechanical equipment and storm water, to the city municipal sewer.[61]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>This apparently did happen, at least for some parts of Dubai! In 2009, the sewage network was inadequate; a second plant opened at the end of the year, and as of 2011, the sewage network was advertised as covering the entire city. However, as of 2013, one of their two sewage plants was receiving about a third of its input via truck, so make of that what you will.</comment>

<comment>If one actually looks at San Jose's annual numbers, the city budget increased by 10% between 2012 and 2014.

<comment>But, but, the easiest way around public service shortfalls is to increase revenues!Right?Right?...</comment>

<comment>Whenever you hear stories like this, you can bet your last dollar that it's due to republican party policies.  What you have trickling down after they're through with your city, or country for that matter, is third world disfunction.</comment>

<comment>Most cities in the U.S. have been run by Democrats for decades. They promise high pay and lavish benefits to the unionized government employees in return for their support at election time. Over the course of several decades, the public treasury is bled dry, and there is no money for basic services.</comment>

<comment>So far as the comic spectacle of an implied social programs advocate "betting his/her last dollar" that the cause of the problem stems from a bunch of filthy capitalists, it reminds me of what was revealed--quite clearly--with the fall of the USSR in 1991...There was a sort of smug phrasing of a famous quote attributed to Lenin:"The Capitalists will sell us the rope with which we will hang them."All this was well and good, but as it turns out, when it came time to buy the rope--and the capitalists, being profit-driven, were ready to sell--the Soviets didn't have the money to buy it, and so capitalism won by default, it seems...Surely you remember this?</comment>

<comment>You obviously know absolutely nothing about the politics of SJ...totally DEMOCRATIC run since 1971...- 2015.  Don't just open our mouth and let your belly rumble...try a Google before you spew typical socialist democrat garbage.  I lived and worked there since 1968 and the SJ politicians were throwing money to the Dept of Corrections unions like drunken sailors and still do.  Liberal Democrat politicians ruined SJ as they have in all other major cities in the US.</comment>

<comment>You obviously know absolutely nothing about the politics of CA.  The republican party crippled the entire state of California in 1978.</comment>

<comment>Proposition 13 was begun by the people and passed by the people. It's kept the government from completely bankrupting the people.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, people will be happy to vote for free ice cream. (And against sending their property tax money to poor people rather than to their own local school systems.)It's also led to a host of negative effects, such as the housing shortage (there are no downsides to high property values, so anyone who owns a house doesn't want to increase the supply), a weird ad-hoc system of work-arounds, more state rather than local control (I'm assuming you don't like that sort of thing)... and you also get the ridiculous spectacle of people citing their "prized family heirlooms" as a justification for the housing crisis. Sheesh.</comment>

<comment>Do yourself a favor...check Google before you spew garbage. Daddy Brown DEMOCRAT,59-67 & WATTS RIOTS, Moonbeam Brown 75-83 Used up a 5Bil surplus to bail our Schools and Unions, next ..Worthless Davis 1999-2003 left office leaving a $34Bil shortfall..here comes Mr.Moonbeam again 2011 - present..after  devastating Oakland as Mayor w/57% spike in homicides but we can credit him with massive exodus of Calif businesses due to taxation.  Any current surplus will be eaten up by Moonbeams  BULLET TRAIN and massive illegal alien & future refugee population.  Thank goodness we had a few Repub Govs in between to stop the bleeding.  Arnold was no Republican, he was merely a brainwashed Kennedy and thank goodness his  "I'll be baaack" did not come to fruition.You obviously know zero about Calif.  I on the other hand have lived and worked here for 60 years.  I am sure you just moved into the State for the weather ..but we do need more 1%'rs however, and I suspect you are not in that category because most of them are getting to hell out.</comment>

<comment>Yes, San Jose is certainly a bastion of conservatism. It is totally the fault of the GOP that the municipal government is criminally inept with a bloated public sector.</comment>

<comment>LOL....that's all you get.</comment>

<comment>San Jose has never elected a Republican Mayor and currently has only one Republican on their city council.But don't let the facts get in your way. </comment>

<comment>Ever heard of prop 13?  Or have you ever heard of tabor.  Have you heard of republican policies in Louisiana and Kansas, and even NJ.  You're way behind the times,</comment>

<comment>The Democratic politicians of Democratic San Jose should have passed other taxes or control their spending in response to Prop 13. But that would have required intelligence, responsibility, and competence. Blaming the Republicans is so much easier. A bit like the person who blames the "devil" for their character flaws.And yes I am behind the times. Intelligence, responsibility, and competence is now mocked and denigrated in the US.</comment>

<comment>I'm interested.  Tell me how SJ could have done things differently.</comment>

<comment>The article mentions several tax increases being considered only now. Those should have been passed many years ago. </comment>

<comment>And why do you think they weren't passed many years ago.</comment>

<comment>I am not sure. Perhaps the lone Republican could not convince the rest of the city council to act like adults. </comment>

<comment>That's interesting.  Have you ever known a Republican to vote to raise taxes since Norquist introduced his oath?</comment>

<comment>That may be our only hope.We clearly cannot expect the Democratic majority of the San Jose council to balance the budget on their own. </comment>

<comment>Norquist may be our only hope?  I'm confused.</comment>

<comment>I notice they made no mention of cost of city employees ....</comment>

<comment>Downtown San Jose just looks real SAD.</comment>

<comment>It is kind of sad. It looks tired. There's no "city buzz" really, except maybe over at San Pedro Square.</comment>

<comment>Lib a zz holes love to tax and spend</comment>

<comment>As opposed to debt and spend?</comment>

<comment>So this entire article is about how the GOP's obsession with cutting taxes to "increase revenues" led to one of the stupidest and most poorly written propositions in the country's history, which led to prosperous towns like San Jose failing because they can't raise taxes to pay for the services progressives are grateful for and conservatives take for granted?$100 million dollar companies will see their taxes go up by 44,000? They will obviously fail and fire everyone and leave the country because of this burden! Quelle horreur!</comment>

<comment>Dems have run San Jose for 40+ years. Nice try. </comment>

<comment>Doesn't really obviate his point since the ' the stupidest and most poorly written propositions in the country's history' is a clear reference to Prop 13 which was a GOP state level initiative if memory serves.</comment>

<comment>The average cop in San Jose makes > $200K/year. Pension liability had tripled in 10 years.Let's start there. </comment>

<comment>They won't start there, it does not fit their narrative.</comment>

<comment>The cities in CA sold their souls to the unions.  Let them eat cake.</comment>

<comment>It's the brainchild of two Republicans, and it was voted on by the public of CA. The legislature had nothing to do with it. Nice try, tho.</comment>

<comment>The city mayor has tried to solve the San Jose budget crisis and was stopped by the public unions:http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB...The average San Jose cop made $200K+ in total comp in 2013, and the city's pension shortfall has tripled in the last 10 years. The city had to cut staff because the unions have artificially driven up the cost of labor.The city of Philly is reporting a $6B pension hole this week. Blue cities have the worst luck!Too much to expect the cub reporter at The Atlantic to report this.  No - it's "where can we find some new taxes?"</comment>

<comment>To clarify Blue cities dont have bad luck, they have proven failed, Democrat economic policies.</comment>

<comment>Um, that was sarcasm.</comment>

<comment>When I lived there pre '96 the latest at that time was that the jail was contracted to Dept of Corrections and the O.t. there paid COs over 100K to hand out plastic spoons....must be much more now.</comment>

<comment>Step one for San Jose (and every other municipality) is to freeze defined benefit pensions in favor of defined contribution pensions.  That plugs the hole in the boat.Step two is to eliminate every dollar spent on non-core city functions.Here are the minutes from the most recent San Jose Arts Commission meeting:http://www.sanjoseca.gov/Docum...Instead of having "neighborhood leaders" in district 3 "decide how to" spend $100,000, spend it on potholes.  Also, cancel the $28,000 feasibility study for a new stage and fix more potholes.  Nobody in Ssn Jose wants to spend money on theatre tickets when potholes are costing drivers hundreds or thousands in damages.</comment>

<comment>Every sad-sack story I hear about California has the same root problem: Proposition 13. Think it's time for Californians to dump that law. It is poison to the community, not a help.</comment>

<comment>They never want to talk about the high cost of their pensions.</comment>

<comment>Yes well you have to cut spending when you cut taxes for it all to work. They didnt cut spending too. Prop 13 isn't the problem, it's the govt. spending.</comment>

<comment>Or raise taxes, a topic few want to consider these days. Free stuff runs out soon. People want to be paid. If we want to maintain a high level of civic services we have to be willing to pay for them. Raising taxes aids in that.Eliminating Prop 13 would be a good step in alleviating this problem.</comment>

<comment>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</comment>

<comment>What does one except in a Democrat run state, and a Democrat run city.</comment>

<comment>Hmmmm... low constrictive taxes which force a shrinking of government services is more of a Republican thing than a Democratic thing, no?</comment>

<comment>Prop 13 should be amended so that it only applies to owner occupied property.  If the property is commercial, the business should only be allowed to claim 1 parcel as owner occupied.  We should not be subsisizing landlords.</comment>

<comment>Cities across America are on the financial brink because they have been run by Democrats for decades.</comment>

<comment>And States across America are on the financial brink because they have been run by Republicans for decades. See how that goes?</comment>

<comment>Like Illinois, Connecticut, and Rhode Island?</comment>

<comment>In a globalized world, wealth doesn't exist in physical place any more. It can go anywhere at the clink of a computer mouse. That even San Jose can't get a piece of the great wealth produced by workers formally operating within its borders shows how true this is, today.</comment>

<comment>Prop 13 more republican stupid at work, government cannot work on air or low taxes.</comment>

<comment>Prop 13  1978 Democratic  California Gov JERRY BROWN.  The property owners of California revolted and voted Prop 13 in.  I kinda think there were some Democrat Property Owners involved in approving it.  But it is good Koolaid socialist rhetoric to blame Repubs.Yes it was definitely a revolt by property owners. But Brown simply funnelled money back to the Administrators, Teacher and State labor unions out of the then incoming taxes.The Californian hardworking taxpayer cant win for losing.    It does not matter how much you tax the workers,  the California socialist politicians will never cut spending.    Heck no...Mr. Moonbeam Brown just continues to push the drastically over budget BULLET TRAIN that nobody wants.    Hey Jerry, what the heck are you smokin...how are you going to get people get out of their cars and on to that train...Oh I just figured it out...he will give free tickets to the welfare recipients to ride up and down the scenic route to prove its ridership.Yes I am afraid increased California taxation is inevitable in California for the hardworking California resident.  And not a Calif Republican majority in sight. Go figure Bocker...</comment>

<comment>Republicans will only be completely satisfied when they have driven the USA down to or below 3rd world status.I lived in a major metropolitan area of Brazil in the late 1960s.  There I saw roads with large pot holes every 100 feet or so and the government collecting money to pay for public services from lotteries. At that time, I laughed and felt pity for Brazilians for allowing such conditions to exist and thought, "Americans would never permit such an appalling state of affairs." Little did I know!I accepted the fact that Brazil, a 3rd world country, didn't have the skills to manage its financial resources. But, I was absolutely shocked that the Brazilian government would allow its impoverished and undereducated citizens to pay for gov't services by luring them into purchasing a worthless lottery ticket. I thought at the time "that's not how government should operate and it surely couldn't happen in the US."However, I didn't foresee the rise of the Republican neocon scheme and all the misery it would visit upon the American people, Beginning with Reagan, the neocon wanted to dominate every facet of the American political, military and economic landscape by imposing their jingoistic concept of never-ending-war in the Middle-East.Neocons want America's wealth and treasure used for war and war related activities, and not "squandered" on the overall betterment of American society.Review the Wiki-article about the nature and history of neocons:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Fear and warmongering is the method they employ to gather supporters. And, they're good at it!Along the way since the 1960s, these Republican neocons have successfully persuaded a cadre of camp followers to support their cause. These are seemingly ordinary people, who naively cannot get beyond the right-wing propaganda juggernaut. Many of them have posted opinions here about this article wherein they blame perceived domestic inequities on welfare queens, Obamacare's socialized medicine, Democrats, liberals...you know the regular list of targets.Is there any hope for America? I have my doubts!</comment>

<comment>Interesting perspective.  San Jose has never elected a Republican mayor and currently only has a single Republican on their city council.Yet, somehow you think it is all the fault of Republicans.Is there any hope for you? Clearly not. </comment>

<comment>Did you read my post?I didn't mention San Jose... but since you have..Let's see if I understand what you are saying... if a Republican had been elected mayor and/or councilman rather than a Democrat... that San Jose's road pot holes would be filled, infrastructure repaired, and the school system fixed?What dream world do you live in? You're joking, right?The city's Democrat administration has not been able to raise sales taxes meaningfully nor increase property taxes (Republican Prop 13) therefore they have been forced to take the following draconian cuts (none of them good).Since 2001, the city has:1. eliminated 1,600 positions across administrative, community, and public safety services. (By 2015, San Jose had 5,759 positions, equal to its 1994 level)2. cut or eliminated public safety investigations, crime prevention programs, and public safety school liaisons3. eliminated a number of fire engine companies4. reduced building code enforcement and long-range city planningcut library hours by 33 percent and closed nearly 80 percent of its community centers5. stopped most infrastructure and road maintenancecut or eliminated park maintenance, street landscaping and sidewalk repairs6. cut and eliminated services to youth, seniors and people with disabilities7. lost hundreds of highly experienced staff at all levels to neighboring jurisdictions8. In all, the city made cuts totaling roughly $450 million, leaving its municipal workforce and level of services far below what they once were.</comment>

<comment>The funny thing is despite all those "cuts" they are still running a deficit. Moreover, despite those "cuts," expenditures are significantly higher now than they were in 2001.So, there have been "cuts," but it hasn't been to spending. Instead, San Jose is paying more to get less.</comment>

<comment>Oh so your solution is to continue drinking Koolaid and to come up with the usual Up the Property Taxes.   All those cuts you spew and the city is still broke yet you would never consider the election of a conservatively run government in all those years of driving the city into the financial depths of despair by years and years of S.J. Democratically run Politicians and Unions who own them.All those cuts and not one social welfare cut among them.   I have a suggestion.  Why not enforce that welfare recipients work part time in Items 1 - 8 that you mention in order to continue receiving the many many many welfare benefits..Section 8 housing, Foodstamps, Monthly stipend, Free cel phone, free childcare,  MediCal/Medicaid just to name a few. I think it is time for us ALL including welfare recipients (if able bodied) to contribute. Yes even the couch potatoes consuming their lobster and steaks that most hard working people only dream of on occasion.THE SYSTEM IS OF THE RAILS.  WE ARE ALL SICK OF IT NATIONWIDE.    .</comment>

<comment>Keep drinking that Left SOCIALIST Koolaid...maybe time for you to head back to Brazil.  Heck..maybe time for all of us working tax paying citizens to head out to Texas.  Most State & Federal government forget who they work for.  The Taxpayer.  Be they Democrat or Republican.  We are both pretty tired of being slapped around.</comment>

<comment>California is a good example of government via ballot initiative doesn't work.  Voters want services without having to pay for them.</comment>

<comment>And liberals want massive increases in population through mass immigration without paying for the infrastructure needed to go along with it.</comment>

<comment>This journalist shares a common thread with many articles of this nature (cities going broke) in that they never ask "Where is all the existing revenue going?" The answer being that the overwhelming majority goes where all city, county and state revenue goes - to pensions and benefits for retired "public servants". This minority of the population is consuming ever more dollars at the expense of needed services like roads, infrastructure, etc. These retirees put in their 20 years, retire with near full benefits and then go back to work. Sometimes again as a "public servant', ironically. That the overwhelming majority of the population in the private sector stands for it is beyond me. They don't don't have such retirement plans. They go to work every day paying payroll taxes so a city worker can enjoy retirement benefits far away better than those they will ever receive. Like Social Security it is a system that is un-sustainable in the long run but goes a long way towards getting politicians re-elected in the short run. Naturally the solution (as always) is to raise taxes to cover for these failed policies as opposed to re-examining what is really at the root of the cause and fixing it.</comment>

<comment>A cop in San Jose retires at 50 with 90% pay, which is then adjusted for inflation.  Forever.</comment>

<comment>And what would you suggest as an appropriate retirement package for someone who spent 25+ yrs risking their lives to keep the citizens safe?</comment>

<comment>Well, a US military officer with the same 25 years of service would only retire at about 50% pay instead of 90%, so there's that.  San Jose cops earn more than military officers at the same years experience too, so that's 50% of a lower base.Wonder how the line-of-duty death rate compares for San Jose police vs US Army infantry officers?</comment>

<comment>Actually, it looks to be 57.5% - 62.5 % (http://militarypay.defense.gov.... Either way, much too low as far as I'm concerned. Why can't we do 100% for 25 years service military and 90% for 25 year service cops? </comment>

<comment>costs too much</comment>

<comment>Why? They'll use that extra money to buy stuff - more money into the economy. Isn't that the idea behind "trickle down economics"?</comment>

<comment>Yes, police officers risk their lives, but so do many of the taxpayers who don't get the same pensions. And being a police officer isn't as dangerous as many other jobs. Some other comment writers have pointed to the military, but there are other jobs in construction and sewers, for instance, that are also dangerous.It's just a question of fairness.And really, I think it's tough being a cop in some big cities, but Silicon Valley doesn't really compare.</comment>

<comment>So, give everyone something that's fair. </comment>

<comment>Well, everyone else works to 65 or 70. You can either come up with huge pensions for everyone or ask the officers to work into the 50s. It's a shame to lose their expertise so early.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. </comment>

<comment>In my opinion, there's nothing wrong that in theory, as long as it's fiscally and economically stable. Problem is - it's not.</comment>

<comment>Social Security is not unsustainable in the long run. Medicare is another matter.</comment>

<comment>I agree, but Social Security and Medicare we paid into our whole working careers. It is not welfare as is Medical/Medicaid is & is a big burden for California and will only be more drastic in the coming few years.    They even pay for dental work which most ordinary tax paying citizen does not have insurance for. .  I believe in helping the poor but there seems to be something untoward about one half of the population paying the taxes to support all the many many welfare programs this State conducts to give Freebies awarded to the ones who contribute nothing by and sustained only by increasing taxes on the working population.There has to be a way to sort out the fraud and abuse.  At least we could redirect the savings in those area to the more needed programs rather than the usual mantra of increasing taxes. Bottomline I think the running of the Local, State and Federal government might be better served if some areas were run by the private sector and by competitive bidding for major government services.   Just a thought.</comment>

<comment>My feeling is that you can fix it going forward (i.e. not offer such generous pensions), but that that you have entered into a contract, and cannot fix it retroactively.</comment>

<comment>Somebody nees to call Brownie and get his take on this situation.</comment>

<comment>Of course the roads are terrible in Ca. We've doubled the population since 1970, through policies of mass immigration, and haven't kept up with infrastructure spending, which degrades quality of life for everyone. Something Economists are too dense to put into their spreadsheets when advocating ever higher rates of immigration.  Also, since the author seems to be doing a series of articles on my hometown...we are running out of water...while continuing to explode population. And no there's no money for any improvements to the water delivery system either (with what water we have left), despite doubling the population.There's no free lunch, you want higher rates of immigration pay for what's necessary to deal with the increase in population.</comment>

<comment>Other than tech companies with juicy in the money stock options and fantastic buyout possibilities (FB buyout of Whatsapp), public sector employment, in the long run, offers far juicier benefits, especially pension.</comment>

<comment>Those days are ending. I have a friend in government whose pension would require at least a decade of employment to pay off. The military too is thinking about scrapping their 20 year rule.</comment>

<comment>The US economy can't devolve to just healthcare and pensions, so you're right.  The shoe will drop.</comment>

<comment>These same problems exist all over the place, the mounting reality that standards of living we currently have - or, at least how we maintain them - aren't sustainable.  A little scratch below the surface of most communities would show similar futures.While this article isn't exactly related, it's certainly germane to our future and deserves strong consideration in discussions about what we need to do as a society.http://www.americanscientist.o...</comment>

<comment>It's always amazing when people think that the costs for infrastructure operations, maintenance & repairs, let alone government operating expenses (including wages and benefits), real estate and business taxes should all be frozen in time and based on tax rates from 50 years ago.One can only wonder if the Chamber of Commerce felt the wages and profits should also be frozen in amber as well. I suspect not. But somehow we convince ourselves that the public services provided by the government shouldn't be more expensive to provide than they were 'way back when'.  It's only when businesses and citizens get tired of watching their community dissolve into third-world conditions do they muster the energy to fix it.</comment>

<comment>Why should public services cost more?</comment>

<comment>Why cost more today than 50 years ago?1.  Inflation.   Prop 13 basically means that you pay less and less tax each year in real terms on your house, meaning less and less revenue in real terms for the city.2.   Regional wage inflation.  When the San Jose city government hires an accountant, janitor, or IT sysadmin, they are now competing with Google and Apple in the local labor market.   Offering 1970 wages is not going to attract many takers in a high-wage, low-unemployment market3.  Increased regulatory requirements.  Federal and state mandates mean that even factoring overall inflation out, it costs more to pave a mile of road today than it did in 1970.   You can argue that federal and state govts shouldn't have done that, but it's not within the power of the city of San Jose to change those requirements on its own.</comment>

<comment>1) Really...show me the math. 2) Government workers are overpaid, this is part of the problem. 3) Thank you Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Because of an increasing population who require more infrastructure, sewers, water, trash removal, etc, etc, etc. Think about it.</comment>

<comment>Over time the economy grows via population growth.</comment>

<comment>Are you being obtuse? That's like asking why a loaf of bread should cost more today than it did during the Depression.  It's called inflation. Even local and state governments are not immune to such pressures. So when the local City has to pay $5M for water system upgrades it's because they're paying market prices for the labor and materials.  Just like you and I do.But for some reason we expect government services and costs to remain flat forever and they don't. Just as your cost of living goes up yearly so does the cost of government services.Even though on average government employment rolls are the lowest they've been in decades, the operating costs of providing services haven't gone down due to market pricing and inflation.</comment>

<comment>Bread does cost more when you compare 1900 to today.   You have to compare the value of the dollar 1900 to 2016.   If you factor in inflation, does bread really cost more?Total government revenue is not flat .http://www.usgovernmentrevenue...http://mercatus.org/publicatio...</comment>

<comment>You get what you pay for.  My utopian dream of a Republican federal government and a democratic state and local government will never happen</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't the other way around be better?  Municipal governments don't usually get involves in the culture war nonsense that Federal Republicans use to cause such damage.  City officials are judged on whether they keep the snow plowed, the streets safe, and make the city a pleasant place to live.  You could be a rabid right wing bible thumper and still accomplish that.</comment>

<comment>My tax dollars are better spent locally and it is engrained in us to hate taxes.  I believe that a small federal government should allow the states to do as they please.  BTW I agree with you on culture wars</comment>

<comment>You are probably an idiot though, as anyone who 'hates taxes' is usually too stupid to understand anything that cant fit on a bumper sticker.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Lol fool, look at the opening post.  You get what you pay for.  I'm not opposed to higher taxes... Idiot</comment>

<comment>That's kind of what has happened though. Republicans by and large control municipal and state government with the exceptions in Illinois, California, Oregon, Hawaii and other New England states (link: https://www.washingtonpost.com.... It's tempting to draw conclusions from that--the democrat led states have absurdly high costs of living, one may possibly go into default (Illinois), and they're old. However, they also are home to our best universities, our billionaires, and a lot of what we are intensely proud of as Americans (Texas excepted). So, pick your poison.</comment>

<comment>I think other issues are at play.  A property tax limit of 2% annum is very high.  Not that many have owned a home for 40+ years.  Do CA cities have other tax resources</comment>

<comment>The answer is simple and constantly repeated in our country. The companies are extracting all they can and will later move on. They will leave their toxic mess behind and the communities will never recover. If you raise the taxes or force compliance the abandonment will occur faster. I live in the Rust Belt, a real time example. Check this out.http://svtc.org/</comment>

<comment>If you want to run a rich city into the ground follow the history of elected SJ mayors:SJ Mayor	Term start	Term end	 	Party58	Ron James	January 9, 1967	January 9, 1971		Democratic59	Norman Mineta	January 9, 1971	January 9, 1975		Democratic60	Janet Gray Hayes	January 9, 1975	January 9, 1983		Democratic61	Tom McEnery	January 9, 1983	January 9, 1991		Democratic62	Susan Hammer	January 9, 1991	January 1, 1999		Democratic63	Ron Gonzales	January 1, 1999	January 1, 2007		Democratic64	Chuck Reed	January 1, 2007	January 1, 2015		Democratic65	Sam Liccardo	January 1, 2015	incumbent		DemocraticYes, Neonnautilus...so much for your Republican trickle down theory for one of the supposed richest AMERICAN cities.

<comment>Genuine question.  I see the homeless woman who will have to wait 12 years to get housed, as someone who should probably take her $900 one month and simply get out of Dodge.  But where to?Where could she go and get housing/not be exposed to extremely cold or hot elements without shelter until she gets shelter?  Where can she find a job?  Aid?  A place that won't run her out of town?   Does anybody have any ideas/experience?Can Americans simply cross the border into Mexico as in movies of old?</comment>

<comment>I used to live in that area. There are large pockets of lower middle class Hispanics and Asians that are not mentioned in this article. The ethnic politics there is stifling. Public hospitals are packed and some have almost closed down as a result, looking for bail-outs. There are so many undocumented people who are arrested that Santa Clara County, by its own law, no longer cooperates with INS requests for deportation holds. There is a lot of crime and Nortenos and Surenos gang activity and homelessness that are turn-offs to large businesses locating there. For residents, rents are unbelievably high -- as higher or higher than S.F., in the $2,000s for a 2BR apartment -- and the vacancy rate for rentals is nearly zero. A typical 60-year-old modest tract home goes for at least $600,000. You have a large contingent of tech workers who make $100K or more a year driving up rents for non-tech workers. There is a huge luxury mall known as Santana Row that has been very successful but it is several miles from S.J.'s downtown area. The work-shop-play approach for downtown has met with only modest success. Police and fire employees make $150,000 to 200,000-plus per year (two cop lieutenants make more than $300,000) from labor contracts negotiated by powerful unions when times were good and now the city can't afford them, nor the pensions that pay 85-90 percent of the retiring person's final pay (they usually end up packing their ending salaries with overtime pay). It's a nice environment, near the Santa Cruz beaches and Big Basin redwoods, quaint towns like Los Gatos, Saratoga and Boulder Creek, but it's tough to live in the Bay Area unless you're in the comfy $100K a year crowd. $77,000 a year is nice, but not that nice, not near enough to afford a home loan.</comment>
