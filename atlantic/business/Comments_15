<comment>Speaking of disparities, why no coverage on the Atlantic of the Kansas shooter? Doesn't fit the demographic narrative? </comment>

<comment>It's astounding how many posts there are from reactionaries who believe media outlets that don't share their views are somehow obligated to sing from their playlist.</comment>

<comment>"Kansas shootings: A gunman killed three people yesterday at a factory in Hesston, Kansas, where he worked, before being killed in a shootout with police. Fourteen others were injured, 10 critically"That's the entire article. No links past that.  Meanwhile, in covering other shootings whole reams of paper have been used by multiple authors at this publication...is the point I think that was trying to be made.  Who knows, there's still tomorrow...maybe they are still writing about it today, just haven't published anything.</comment>

<comment>The point the Courageous Mister J is making is that he's chomping at the bit to harp on the fact that the shooter is black. Tomorrow may never be, and he's ready now.</comment>

<comment>I agree that may be his intent, but I would argue that he's not really all that wrong in pointing out the disparity.  I'm just not going to go as far as saying that they (The Atlantic) won't write anything else about it.  Maybe the story is still too young, or maybe they will not address it at all...still it's their choice and a hater's gotta hate, I guess.</comment>

<comment>Tatted up stone cold crazy vicious young black male felon who never ought have been hired there. It is wrong to force helpless employees to defend themselves or be put in the position of rehabbing a paroled violent criminal. The federal govt. needs a better way to deal with masses of catch 'n' release criminals than bribing employers with financial incentives to hire felons, who will always have the easy means to illegally obtain guns. These are not our finest, smartest and most trustworthy citizens, so what makes anyone think they'll suddenly respect gun laws or codes of behavior in the workplace?</comment>

<comment>These racists are odd. What makes a shooter a shooter is the fact that they have a gun (or several) not the melinin in thier skin. That was only effects Vitamin D or thier camouflage.</comment>

<comment>It's acceptable (though indicative of a lack of integrity) from private publications, but there are other publicly-funded organizations with New People Read who are doing the same thing.  That's not acceptable.</comment>

<comment>Mass shootings have become so common as to no longer be news worthy. Yay, progress.</comment>

<comment>So now you're complaining about the 'liberal media' NOT covering mass shootings, and giving gun owners a bad name?</comment>

<comment>Judging from what I've read elsewhere, there isn't a whole lot to be said about the Kansas shooter. He got served a restraining order, and then he went postal. Throw in how close it is coming after the Kalamazoo shooter, and people's jadedness about spectacular violence in this country...it isn't really that big of a mystery.</comment>

<comment>If the green was blue, it would pretty closely reflect voting patterns too.  Not to mention college degree rates, population density, evangelicals, etc.  Basically, the two Americas.</comment>

<comment>True, and what it really means is that GOP policy has NOT produced growth for anyone but the oligarchy.  'the people' in a Red state are completely left behind.</comment>

<comment>Sort of. East of the Mississippi, yes. But not in places like Wyoming or North Dakota.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I was oversimplifying.  Though, ND's economy has already begun to decline in lockstep with the price of oil.</comment>

<comment>While I am no Federalist, realities like this remind why so many want to focus on empowering local governments to respond in ways that state and federal authorities can't because the big picture can obscure the devilish details.</comment>

<comment>The problem is when a one-dimensional economy like that in ND busts, neither the locals or the state are capable of handling it.  They come back to us in the Northeast for the money we generate for the nation.  On at least some level, that should give us a say.It's tricky.</comment>

<comment>Federal programs can attempt to encourage them to diversify their economy and "save for a rainy day", as state governments for one reason or another can become subservient to that one industry. ND's politics changed radically because of the influx of workers looking for quick money (and the companies that came for the oil).</comment>

<comment>I really understand your point, and I don't want to eliminate the voices of urban voters at all.  However, most of the rural counties across the country hit hardest by the recession had no say whatsoever both in the de-industrialization of the post 40-plus years and are full of people who feel ignored by the establishment of both parties, feel scared for their futures, and feel angry at basically everyone else.I really do not share the anger of Trump supporters, and I find them misguided in their choice of demagogues like him, but their voices are not going away until and unless those underlying problems are addressed (hopefully by someone like Bernie).</comment>

<comment>Interesting.  The question that immediately comes to mind, given the structure of the Senate and the existence of the Electoral College, is, perhaps they weren't without say, but instead said the wrong things?  In other words, we're voters so focused on social issues that, they, as the pundits are prone to say, "voted against their economic interests" too often?Isnt the Trump phenomenon merely going to permit the continuation of this practice? </comment>

<comment>While I do understand where you're going with this, so much of Trump's support comes from blue-collar folks in rural areas who are still overwhelming hurt by the recession.His supporters would be able to stop any attempt to reform the Senate since the most consequential changes would require a Constitutional amendment.  Such a move would likely be counterproductive as they would be driven further into Trump's arms by what they would see as an attempt to take away what little voice they think they have.While they may not admit that they have more of a voice than maybe they should, their own perceptions, driven by anger, fear, and economic distress, will drive their actions.  What some may see as a reasoned discussion about the relative power balance between rural and urban states may actually heighten the influence of demagogues like Trump who pretend to listen to them.Remember, snake oil salesmen don't sell exclusively to the gullible people, the stupid people, or the deluded; they also sell to the desperate people.  And even unsuccessful attempts at reforming the Senate or the electoral college like that will simply make them more desperate.  This will give further credence to the idea that urban coastal elites really don't care at all about rural people anyway and drive them into the arms of the next snake-oil salesman even more than a focus on social issues.</comment>

<comment>"[M]uch of Trump's support. . . "And, they may well cast votes out of spite, once again electing a candidate who has no policy plans that will actually help their economic predicament.If we're being honest, it's likely time to admit that middle-aged men in such areas are doomed.</comment>

<comment>And if enough people are desperate enough to buy Trump's snake oil, we all will suffer.“That if desperate times call for desperate measures, then I'm free to act as desperately as I wish.”  - Suzanne CollinsAddressing their desperation, as opposed to their faulty reasoning, will likely be one of the keys to neutralizing Trump.Even if you do not care one whit about their suffering (and for me, there are plenty of people whose suffering is worse and of higher priority), their political influence, however diminished, cannot be completely ignored, if only for partisan political reasons.  If demagogues are the only ones who sympathize with them at all, then we all suffer when they threaten to elect demagogues for national office.</comment>

<comment>To anybody who has seen the effects of social breakdown on a poor community, their votes seem both intelligent and rational.  A community with a high rate of stable marriage, low illegitimacy, low addiction and so on can thrive where a community with double the income and broken families has no hope.While the particular areas of battle may have been wrong in some cases, the general thrust of retaining traditional norms of marriage, sexuality and social structure was vitally important for those groups.  Their tragedy was that the groups determined to promote a freer sexuality and a looser attitude to drugs was not willing to respect their need for puritanism.Read the early supreme court cases (before the eighteenth amendment) striking down local liquor control laws and see how long they have had this fight, and the determination of a section of the privileged to destroy them.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, that is really not the case in Hawaii.  Our state is overwhelmingly run by Democrats, and while the overall state numbers may look fine to a casual observer, places like Honolulu obscure how uneven the recovery has been for many of the more rural areas of the state.</comment>

<comment>Rural areas in general have done poorly-- unless they have important natural resources (e.g., oil), or they are in places that people want to retire to.</comment>

<comment>And in places like Hawaii, it is far too easy to allow the influx of affluent retirees to obscure high levels of poverty.  Thankfully, the chart in the article does a great job of avoiding that problem, and the article sheds specifically sheds light on it.Some people here actually believe that the migration of affluent people here has actually exacerbated the problem; such folks, no matter how well-meaning, can have outsized influence while being ignorant of the plight of the poor who were already here.  The problem is less about gentrification (though it partially is), as it is about economic stratification by geography as the affluent remain geographically and politically aloof to the problems of the poor.For Hawaii in particular, simply moving away is less attractive (or even feasible) to many, given the attendant loss of family and social connections (particularly amongst people of color).  While social contact can easily be maintained across the ocean, assistance such as housing or vehicle maintenance is much more difficult to give from afar (without a surplus of cash).</comment>

<comment>The same problem happened in reverse in the 60s and 70s. Cities hollowed out as people moved to the rural areas, which became small towns and suburbs. Now the wheel has turned. People are moving back to the cities. </comment>

<comment>I wrote a story about a farmer in my freelance days. With several pieces of expensive equipment and a big truck built to haul grain, he could farm hundreds of acres of soybeans, corn or wheat by himself. He was in his '60s and didn't make much money.Rural areas don't really have full-time jobs anymore beyond the retirement homes and regional hospital.</comment>

<comment>That's true now, but such rural areas used to, and Trump's supporters remember when those jobs were available.  Their anger will not subside until the current economic dynamic is reversed.  The fact that they are largely wrong in blaming immigration has not changed how they see the world, their place in it, and whom they should support.The Democratic party can crow all day about demographic destiny being in their hands, but the short to medium term is much less rosy.  And while I agree that Trump's chances of winning the Presidency are slim due to his toxicity to much of the electorate, the stakes are far too high to make light of him and his supporters.  More importantly, whether he wins or loses, the anger, fear, and economic distress that fuels his rise will not be extinguished by the end of this election cycle.</comment>

<comment>It also roughly follows the pattern of distribution of minorities in the US.</comment>

<comment>MZaleActually a lot of the areas marked "red" are Democratic strongholds. You seem to be judging the map simply from a state levelTo be honest, I don't think that the map proves  any ideological point. Except that if you look closely at it, many "poor" areas  are very close to "well off" areas.So that its a somewhat complex map.I also think that it understates things a bit in some areas.For instance,  lots of rural areas in places like Pennsylvania  are marked green.Simply because they lost so many jobs that  younger residents left the area.. But if you looked at all of the green spots of northeastern and Western PA, you would think that they were prosperous areas. Which really is not the caseIts an interesting map. But I think that it doesn't really prove or show too much</comment>

<comment>I would also add that other issues complicate the map and the overall issue. I looked at my own zip code and the zip code just above me.The zip code exactly  above mine is very "red".And its defintly true that its a very poor  neighborhood in Baltimore.But its also where Johns Hopkins Medical Campus is. Where there are lots of high paying jobs for educated workers. So the problem in that area is not lack of high paying jobs.Its lack of education to get those jobsSome parts of America have large regions that are "Poor".But even this map shows that its rarely whole intact regions of poverty.There is plenty of green mixed into  the red areas.And vise versa</comment>

<comment>So am I to believe that if we rank by performance, the bottom 20% will have worse performance than the 80% with higher rankings?!?!  Should have taken that advanced statistics class back in college.</comment>

<comment>Although it may be obvious to the editor, I find that a key for the map would be helpful.</comment>

<comment>This is exactly why the recent job reports are so misleading. What kind of jobs?  More restaurant service work? More part-time positions with no benefits? Unskilled labor and people over 50 who have been laid off from corporate jobs in this country are screwed. You can't make ends meet on several cobbled-together minimum wage part-time positions, and even the people who are employed in corporate America haven't seen significant raises in years.  Recovery, my butt.  The South is drowning and racial tensions are high. Is it any wonder why Trump's xenophobic rantings are taking hold? Anyone see any similarities to 1930's Germany?</comment>

<comment>Re: Anyone see any similarities to 1930's Germany?Not really.Unemployment was over 30% in Germany in 1933, and there was very little in the way of a social safety net. We are a long, long way from that.And yes, there has been a recovery- but as the article notes, it's been an uneven one. More of one in the cities and suburbs (where most people live), not much of one in the countryside, except in place with oil or other valuable resources.</comment>

<comment>Iowa seems to be doing OK too. Must be all those farm and ethanol subsidies.</comment>

<comment>It's lots of fun to decry the Federal government.  If you can avoid noticing how much of your income is due to Federal subsidies.  Iowa farmers seem to have got the knack.</comment>

<comment>As David Frum has pointed out elsewhere on this website, Trump's supporters are less ideologically opposed to Federal largesse in principle; what they are opposed to is largess given to people whom they see as undeserving.I imagine that rural Trump supporters from Iowa simply see Ethanol subsidies as not only materially good for them, but good for the country.  They might point out that food has to be grown, so why not support American farms to grow them?  Where you might see them as hypocrites, they see themselves as correct.  You can agree with them or don't, but to keep Trump from winning, we at least need to understand where they are coming from, and what it will take to mitigate their anger.Given their loudness, numbers, and geographic distribution, we can't completely ignore them (no matter how much we may want to).  Dismissing them may be emotionally satisfying, but it doesn't help anyone beat them.</comment>

<comment>Trump came in 2nd in Iowa.</comment>

<comment>All those questions are answered in the jobs report. It breaks down the gains or losses by category, and even includes wage gains or losses.The South is drowning, but then look at the governments the elect. Bobby Jindal, Sam Brownback, Nathan Deal, Rick Scott. They spend all their time attacking gays, planned parenthood, unions and putting up statues to the 10 commandments. Until thier politics change thier plight will not.</comment>

<comment>For the first time in a long time, I no longer feel that we in Hawaii are left out of the conversation.  I'm floored by the breakdown by zip code and how accurate the economic stratification is for Hawaii county in particular.  Our state may seem like paradise to all of the tourists, but there are plenty of folks who have been left behind by the so-called economic recovery, and nigh-uncontested Democrats have not changed that (no matter how good their intentions are).</comment>

<comment>That interactive map was fun.  I found out that just about everyone in my zip code is a high school graduate.</comment>

<comment>Yet another display of rural misery that nobody wants to talk about because who cares about rednecks, right?</comment>

<comment>poor white people don't exist.</comment>

<comment>Not sure if sarc...</comment>

<comment>I left it ambiguous like that : )</comment>

<comment>Looks to me like the rednecks need to stop voting republican.</comment>

<comment>Just exactly what would voting for Democrats get them keeping in mind that Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, etc... are all Democratic stongholds.</comment>

<comment>Pretty much every large city elects Democrats. Your point is...?</comment>

<comment>As are San Jose, Austin, Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, Portland, Seattle and a bunch of other cities that are all doing great. Your point?</comment>

<comment>exactly my point- it seems to make no difference - i.e. the political party in power is irrelevant (except to the party in power).So what would voting for Democrats get them?  How would they be lifted out of their redneck ways?</comment>

<comment>It looks rather like it makes no difference if you have a Democratic administration -- you may or may not do well.  But if you have a Republican administration, you can count on it that you are doing badly.  There are a few exceptions, as always.  But the patterm is very clear.As always, the question is: which is cause and which is effect?</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, at least here in Hawaii, there are plenty of we rural folks that do elect Democrats, but don't feel like they care enough about us, or remember years of corruption and incompetence by Democrats who have run the state and still run.</comment>

<comment>There has been no recovery</comment>

<comment>It's not even a matter of geography.  It's the knowledge economy.  Even during the height of the Great Recession I think the unemployment rate in tech was at most around 5%.  Now it's down to around 2% to 3% nationally.The blue collar working class by contrast has been decimated.  That process started before 2008 and has only gotten worse since.I left a safe but boring job in 2008 to enter private industry.  Within two years I doubled my salary and I haven't looked back since.  Recession?  What recession?  Me and my friends are rolling in cash.  But there are millions of middle aged people working part time selling coffee who are desperate and struggling.  Their rage is driving the candidacies of both Trump and Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Well, I was in the knowledge economy and lost my job in 2008. I got another temporary job (non techie) in the 2009-2010 period along with going back to school. But have since gone back to tech and am doing OK.But please let there not be another recession. Things are just beginning to look up. I can't imagine what it's like for someone who had a worse time.Also, your last point may not be quite accurate. Sanders is generational, not income. Trump is all over the place, but he picks up support in well-2-do areas as not.</comment>

<comment>Geography and the knowledge economy feed off each other to exacerbate the problems of the working class and the poor.  Poor rural school districts are least able to prepare their students for the knowledge economy, while the children of tech workers will be primed for it (for reasons other than money).Rural areas have been hit hardest economically for many reasons, but the concentration of the tech jobs in urban coastal regions exacerbates these problems.</comment>

<comment>Rural school districts are generally not doing well at preparing their students for the knowledge economy.  But it doesn't have to be that way.I grew up in a rural school district.  However it did a great job of preparing us all for what would, several decades later, be called STEM fields.  Of course, the parents here were enthusiastic about education, and willing to work to make sure that their children got a good one.  If the parents in a district are more focused on other issues, that won't happen.</comment>

<comment>The principle of my combined Elementary and Middle school made it a point to do as much as he could to boost spending towards science and technology during his tenure.  Unfortunately, the best of intentions can only go so far without money and a local knowledge base.In Tech hubs, more people have knowledge about the ins and outs of STEM, and can help patch holes in the local school curriculum (at least concerning STEM).  Unfortunately, the tendency for tech hubs to center around urban centers can leave far too many poor, rural students at a huge disadvantage.  Especially when the prospect of boosting STEM in towns that were hammered by outsourcing and de-industrialization can feel like treason to many of the people hurt most by the knowledge economy.Right or wrong, it is not surprising that Trump's support comes from more rural, more blue-collar, less educated people who feel clobbered by the recession and the knowledge economy.  Whether or not the knowledge economy is better for the country as a whole, we need to at least acknowledge that it creates winners and losers; those losers will continue to agitate for demagogues like Trump until and unless their underlying economic distress is actually addressed, something which too many coastal urban elites flat out refuse to.I do not support Trump at all, but the anger that fuels his support is saddening, unsurprising, and persistent.</comment>

<comment>Right. I live in the Boston area and everyone I know is in tech or in pharma. Only 1 person I know got laid off during the downturn and she found a job in a few months. Restaurants were pack during the entire downturn. Its as if it did not even happen here.</comment>

<comment>Your experience highlights how geography can keep so many higher-educated elites in both parties can remain ignorant of the problems of the poor.  If the politicians can't even see the problem, they're much less likely to support solutions to it.</comment>

<comment>Does this data account for moving? Perhaps those who gain employment, might end up moving to nicer communities, and thus drive up the employment rate there?Conversely, someone who loses a job, may need to move somewhere cheaper if they can. </comment>

<comment>That is a very interesting angle that needs much more data.  I remember a chapter in either Freakonomics or Super Freakonomics about the positive impact of moving poor families into rich neighborhoods.  Unfortunately, no matter how successful it would be, such a policy on a wide scale would see much more resistance than busing ever did.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I was talking more about people moving on their own when their circumstances change and how this might affect the reported change in employment rates at the zipcode level, as opposed to people being moved first and then hoping their economic circumstances change.</comment>

<comment>And the South falls further behind. I live in an area where roughly 1/3 of the population lives at or below the poverty line. The lack of jobs, poor education system and ineffective government is at the root of it. It's sad knowing that unless a drastic change is made this part of the country will decline further and further.</comment>
