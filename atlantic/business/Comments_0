<comment>There is nothing wrong with Whites who want to live near other Whites and not be a minority somewhere else. Why should Whites move away from their families and tribes? It's unnatural.</comment>

<comment>Its wrong because its whites, silly. If blacks want to live near people who look like them, well that's okay, that's natural, nothing wrong there. But if white people do the same, well its all just a big racist conspiracy.Here's an idea. Address the reasons why white flight occurs. People dont flee neighborhoods just because a black family or two move in. The skin color isn't the problem. It's that each neighborhood, regardless of color, tends to have its own set of social norms, acceptable behavior, etc. And when you bring in black families who come from a very different environment, they grate against the acceptable behavior norms of the existing neighborhood. Those who have the ability will end up moving away, rather than waiting to see if the black families assimilate into their new neighborhood. Both bc of a lack of patience, and also because often these black families do not assimilate, they stick out like sore thumbs, until enough white flight has occurred that they now fit in with the NEW neighborhood norms.</comment>

<comment>Stop it! The truth will make lefties howl at the moon! I want to actually sleep tonight!</comment>

<comment>Yeah but I bet you the kind of whites who escape diverse urban centers are also the kind who preach about the wonders of diversityIt would make more sense for the races to balkanize both in urban and rural environments</comment>

<comment>That's kind of how I look at it.  I mean lets go back 100 years.  My family were mainly Polish immigrants or second/third generation Polish-Americans in the midwest.  Some of them spent time as farmers in various places for a few years but most lived in Milwaukee at some point.  And when they lived in Milwaukee they lived on the south side of Milwaukee because that's where Polish-Americans lived.  There was no law that I'm aware of which compelled them to live there or which prevented them from living on the (mainly German) north side but people just like to live amongst similar people.  Its where all their cultural institutions are and where most of their friends are.  As a result they all lived in that neighborhood.Fast forward 100 years and the ethnic differences amongst white America aren't that meaningful anymore.  But I would argue that there is still a white-American culture that's distinct from black, Asian, or native American culture.  And people still want to live amongst people of a similar culture.  So what's wrong with that?  Do you really need white people in your neighborhood to keep the crime down or to keep the schools highly regarded?  I don't see why.</comment>

<comment>"Do you really need white people in your neighborhood to keep the crime down or to keep the schools highly regarded? I don't see why."^^^^ THAT is the most significant message I've seen in here so far.</comment>

<comment>The financial hacking industry is a white supremacy tribe after all.  Hacking the housing industry to create ghettos is a white supremacy  tribal conspiracy for sure.</comment>

<comment>Tribalism is the oldest form of social solidarity. Whites have been doing it for 5,000 years. That's not exactly a 'life hack'.</comment>

<comment>Social solidarity  to enslave people that followed by hacking the deeds so that they could exclude their victims in participating in economy with equal footing is racism. KKK by that token is a solidarity group..5000 years!  how did you come up with that?   Is it in the bible and fictional Jesus  copied from Egyptians Sun God that you claimed to have been white?</comment>

<comment>I don't think it's a coincidence that the first White people appeared at about the same time as the events of the Tower of Babel.</comment>

<comment>Who knows what is white people.  There is no ethnic group called white people.  There is nothing that defines a white race either .   Caucasian race was dreamed up by a German philosopher from Tower of Babel.</comment>

<comment>White skin color is a fairly recent genetic mutation. </comment>

<comment>Ok, yup, about 8000 years ago they started to look have a different skin colors so it is not an ancient thing...http://www.sciencemag.org/news...</comment>

<comment>So you agree that a White Race can be defined genetically?This contradicts what you said earlier...</comment>

<comment>No I don't.   Skin color is not a race.  It is variable characteristic and that is why it is recent.   Did Europeans have race change operation 8000 years ago? Nope.    There many people around world that have have children with light skin while they have darker skin or the apposite and that does not mean that they are a race or had race change operation.</comment>

<comment>Funny you can't tell the difference between the races, but bacteria can.http://www.popsci.com/article/...And doctors can...Also if your mixed it will be a bit harder to find a bone marrow transplant - http://content.time.com/time/h...</comment>

<comment>Keep posting diatribe..  If the skin color would make people compatible, the wouldn't need any other test you illiterate hack</comment>

<comment>As a New Yorker, I don't understand why anyone would want to live in the suburbs anyway. Even a small sized city is preferable to living in suburban New Jersey or wherever.</comment>

<comment>Maybe some people have adapted to it, but city life is essentially unnatural.Humans have evolved to live in groups of between 200 and 300 people, which is also why such a number is the 'upper limit' of people we are able to know socially. Anything more than that, and you're taking the human psyche on a dangerous trip into unknown territory.</comment>

<comment>As someone who was born in a tractor town, raised in a lumber town, and now lives in a fairly major metro area, I can assure you that just because you rub shoulders with thousands of people a week in the city, that doesn't mean you actually get to know - or try to get to know - most of them. City life isn't a hard adaptation - there are drawbacks and benefits, like anywhere else, but it's hardly an exercise in the Lovecraftian horror of overwhelming scale. You just know the people you know, and everyone else is just someone with whom you're temporarily sharing a space - a fellow pilgrim on the road, or a cafe patron at the next table - same as anywhere. We city folk do just fine.</comment>

<comment>upvoted for "Lovecraftian horror of overwhelming scale" that is a gem!</comment>

<comment>One of the advantages of living in a big city is that you have the opportunity to constantly meet new people, which in turn leads to the opportunity to ditch old prejudices.</comment>

<comment>One of the disadvantages is the increased opportunity of others to try and meet you.  :(</comment>

<comment>Or to have those prejudices confirmed...</comment>

<comment>Or create new prejudices.</comment>

<comment>Writing comments in an online comment section is much more unnatural than living in a city.</comment>

<comment>And?</comment>

<comment>And it doesn't matter.  Naturalistic fallacy.</comment>

<comment>Banal vacuousness.</comment>

<comment>This is absolutely correct. People living in megalopolises is unnatural.</comment>

<comment>since we have been living in cities for about 6 thousand years, I don't think that's an issue.</comment>

<comment>And look what happened, over and over again. Warfare. Famine. Epidemics. Cities appearing and disappearing within 200 years.</comment>

<comment>also art, science, math, civilization, religion, medicine, philosophy and all kinds of other great things that make your modern life even possible.  And some cities like Jericho have been continuously inhabited for 8000 years. so what's your point?</comment>

<comment>And all that time the very wealthy, the most powerful, lived in the cities but did their best to get out of town into the suburbs to get away from the masses.  Only in modern times have ordinary people been able to work in cities but live like royalty in the countryside.</comment>

<comment>And, until recently, most city dwellers died earlier than their MORE numerous percentage wise country cousins. We gravitate towards some away from others, normal.</comment>

<comment>That is your choice, stop acting bewildered that your choice is not hte defacto choice for many.  Since obviously your mom did not teach you this, the world does not revolve around you.  Your opinion is not the 'right' one.  Stop being a narcissist</comment>

<comment>Blithely assuming someone's opinion is wrong just because it's only one opinion is a major logical blunder.</comment>

<comment>Well that's because in New York your "suburbs" are in Jersey haha.  In other areas of the country we actually have pretty nice suburbs.</comment>

<comment>Schools, cost of living, and space. If those things don't matter to you than New York is great, but if they do than the suburbs are much more appealing.</comment>

<comment>I know someone who is paying $20,000 a month to rent an apartment on the West Side in New York, an apartment that I would not describe as fancy or in a fancy building.  I don't understand it. They could live in the suburbs with a lot more room and take a helicopter into work each day for that amount of money.Other advantages? In some New Jersey suburbs you could have a crab trap out each day so you could eat fresh crabs when you got home. In some New Jersey suburbs the small amount of snow that arrives in the winter is usually white, not gray.  In some New Jersey suburbs you can hunt deer nearby when you come home from work and make some great pepperoni. There are New Jersey suburbs where you can look up at the sky and actually see lots of stars.  In some New Jersey suburbs you can tinker in your garage and indulge yourself in a hobby such as woodworking, to lower your stress level.  You can actually have a real dog instead of a psychologically disturbed pet that is frightened to step outside of an apartment.</comment>

<comment>Pretty simple.  When I lived in an urban center my studio apartment was $1200 a month.  Now I live in the suburbs and my 3 bedroom house is $1200 a month.  This isn't rocket science.</comment>

<comment>Well that's why you're in New York and I am in the outskirts of Seattle.What I love about the Portland / Seattle 'burbs:1. Trees.2. Trees.3. Trees.4. Lakes to kayak in.5. Mountains to ski on.6. Roads to bike on (relatively safely).7. Diverse populations (about 40% foreign born in my neighborhood, about 35% in our suburban city, only 17% in Seattle, same patterns hold; Seattle has more African Americans but only by about 4% of total population.8. Great integrated schools (vs. Seattle whose schools are less integrated).I mean what can we say? It's really nice. Seattle is nice, too, but we can't afford to live there. Seattle's extremely expensive, and it's whiter, and we have lower crime out here in the suburbs...you know..with all the Latinos and Russians I guess?New York is lovely for a visit but I wouldn't want to live there. I'll take riding bikes down to the lake where they rent kayaks by the hour any day, and paddle off into the trees, then back again... to have tacos at the taco truck, or maybe the best Thai or Chinese in the northwest. It's no New York City but it's nice enough for me.</comment>

<comment>As someone who was born in Queens but raised in the suburbs on the other coast I would have a hard time justifying the move back.  NYC has become a safe place to live I'll grant out that, but for the first few decades of my life it was a cesspool.  As much as anything now I don't see how you people afford it.  Jobs may pay more in your city but the price of everything from rent to a pair of jeans to a bottle of milk are so much higher than out here in the hinterlands that you would have to force me there at gunpoint.</comment>

<comment>How to tell if you're racist or not: a white person's guide.Imagine that you're planning to move somewhere in a metro area. Which question worries you more?A) I found a good deal on a home with the amenities I want, but will my moving there contribute to gentrification?? (not noticeably racist)B) I found a good deal on a home with the amenities I want, but are there too many non-white people?? (noticeably racist)Obviously, my personal feelings aside, people are free to choose whichever they want, but as a man of pretty modest means myself, it always surprises me the financial lengths that markedly racist people are willing to go to insulate themselves from ethnically (or even financially) diverse neighborhoods. Who can even afford to be that craven?</comment>

<comment>Considering a home is the largest financial investment any family will make, and is often the largest asset; there should be no surprise that many white families get concerned when there is an increase in blacks to a neighborhood.  Unfortunately, over 11.7% blacks and property value declines.  Maybe you have money to burn, but for most ppl, loosing money on such a large investment just because of who your neighbors are is very important</comment>

<comment>Sadly, true. It's really 17.2%, though..</comment>

<comment>11.7 is when white flight starts</comment>

<comment>Cuz White people are not stupid. 10% is when we notice the trend. Around 25% black is when crime and homicide from that group becomes undeniable and White flight really ramps up.</comment>

<comment>They have done studies and white flight actually begins at 11.7%.  It starts subtly with the wealthy or better off.  By 17-18% working class whites start leaving as crime rises and school quality falls.  By 25%, even low income whites start to leave in droves.   Look at Ferguson MO.  20 years ago it was over 90% white and crime was minuscule and it could fund itself off property taxes and wage taxes.  Over that time period, demographics changed rapidly and now the community has to use fines to pay its basic bills.  Black ppl just dont pay their way and destroy property values.  that is why I love gentrification.  Blacks destroy a neighborhood, then whites and asians come in, buy up the property cheap then drive out backs with higher rents and property values.  Best thing EVER</comment>

<comment>I know, I grew up 10 miles from Ferguson in Hazelwood, Mo. Section 8 vouchers were the beginning of black dysfunction being shipped into North County from North city. Older apartment complexes went section 8 and crime quickly spread from those and into surrounding neighborhoods. It was like watching dominos fall after that. My mother died when I was 21 so I took over the house there in Hazelwood. I stayed all the way through the Ferguson riots, but knew it was way past time to get out. Property values dropped as much as 40% for some. Sold the house to flippers for $55,000 and just barely broke even on it. But I got the hell out of there! lol</comment>

<comment>What is funny is how ineffective liberal groups are.  The tea Party got most of what it wanted and completely shook up Congress.  All Black Lives matter has done is make a community - Ferguson - which was struggling financially become more fiscally stressed.  Since the riots anyone with the means has left (lowing the amount of income tax) and property values have plunged (lower property taxes) further straining their finances.  So in the end all the Black Lives matter will end up doing is making the schools worse and the community less safe.  Bravo - keep it up liberals!</comment>

<comment>" ..and now the community has to use fines to pay its basic bills" I don't know if you remember, but that was in the DOJ report on Ferguson and North StL county. The claim was police target blacks with excessive tickets and fines. That actually became their biggest argument against LE because the "police shoot unarmed black children" wasn't holding much water. They never mention that blacks get amnesty days around here to be relieved of whatever citation. Those don't happen in Chesterfield, Mo. Nome sayin'?</comment>

<comment>Drive around to various neighborhoods and notice who keeps their homes' repairs & maintenance kept-up, who keeps their pets contained, adheres to their  neighborhoods' home capital improvements standards, such as no chain link fences, etc. And, most importantly, who assimilates with the other neighbors by paying their HOA dues to keep the common grounds mowed and landscaped. Who is active with advocating for school zone regulations and other local gvmt issues pertaining to the neighborhood. Or organizing neighborhood get togethers or Watch alert directories.Again, it's not a color of skin thing, but a more common sense of standards that come with having pride and respect for one's neighbors, their appreciating home values, and the community values.  </comment>

<comment>I see nice homes everywhere people own, and more of a mix where people rent. That's all I ever see, and I've been shopping around, from Seattle to Albuquerque to Memphis to Buffalo, for a couple years now in anticipation of eventually being far enough out of debt to consider a down payment somewhere with my soon-to-be wife. I see that places with neighborhood advocacy groups - regardless of demographic makeup - tend to be nicer, and that it usually comes down to home ownership and the sense of place that fosters, plus access to decent jobs/decent credit to be able to afford money down, mortgage payments, and improvements on top of that. I've rarely seen anything else.</comment>

<comment>You'd think they'd take better care of their own homes considering the great job they do taking care of mine.</comment>

<comment>Ive seen 1st hand these home-owners pool the funds of several families together  to move 2 somewhat large families into a moderate sized home and ignore home-owner covenants by putting window air-conditioner units  in rather than required HVAC systems. And setting up an auto- body repair business in their driveway/garage in a neighborhood that prohibits activity.  Pride Matters.</comment>

<comment>Yeah and I have a friend who continually violates local bylaws and has weekly garage sales that neighbors keep complaining about and want to shut down. Its his hobby.  He and his neighbors are white.  So what you have observed first hand is just an anecdote that applies to all cultures.</comment>

<comment>But more for certain segments of society. Anybody can find the one-off example of a White man doing this in a higher home value neighborhood. Usually these riff raff  can't afford to live in the exclusive neighborhoods. Liberals just want to give quotas based on the color of one's skin. Racists.</comment>

<comment>And pride cripples. MY observation here in Richmond, where Mexicans are thriving, and blacks moving out, is that Mexicans band together, live two families to a 3 bedroom home until the economies of scale in cooking, school transportation, etc give them the financial savings to buy another house, usually nearby.Blacks, sadly, don't support their families like Mexicans do, and fight a lot with each other, usually with drive-by shootings.The reasons, I don't really know, but the observations stand.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I really don't have a problem with Mexicans. They are usually very close-knit, very hard-working family- oriented, kind people.But sometimes when they come from a country like Mexico with much lower standards, where homes & yards are not as maintained - on average, pets and their many kids run loose, etc., this sometimes causes a problem with strict HOA convenants who want their neighborhood homes to appreciate in value. The German neighbors are obsessive, I've noticed, about their yards and maintenance. Perfectionists.Cultures do Matter. 'Melting Pot' is overrated sometimes. </comment>

<comment>So true. I live in apt in DC, and have been here for ~ 5 years. At the start, was mostly white and Asian residents. No real problems, mostly nice place to live, kept up, etc. Over time, and especially recently, have noticed a lot more blacks living in my building. And you know what else I've noticed? Noise complaints have skyrocketed. Complaints about thumping bass at all hours of the night, weekends, week days, etc. Screaming and shouting and running down the halls. Loud parties. Now sure, I suppose we could have been taken over by white frat guys, except every time I see the screaming and shouting...its black kids.I dont dislike living near them because they are black. I dislike it because they dont appear to adhere to the basic social norms and behavior of the building, and dont seem to have any intention of assimilating into the group. I'd hate them if they were white kids doing the same thing. Either way, its disruptive, and it will be contributing to my flight when my lease is up.I'd happily move into a building of predominantly black and Hispanic folks who maintained a relatively quiet, peaceful, well-kept up property, no problems. But you can be darn sure I'll be moving out ASAP when the non-quiet, non-peaceful blacks start moving in.</comment>

<comment>Exactly - even if they were drunkard, southern White trash...same thing.These writers ignore the behavior; it's all about the color of one's skin. </comment>

<comment>Do you live in DC proper? A building where blacks are moving IN and whites and asians moving OUT? That sounds like the suburbs to me and the opposite experience I had in the two apartment buildings I lived in while in DC.</comment>

<comment>Sadly this is sometimes true. My neighborhood is veryintegrated, working class. There are two black families across a street from mewhom I wish were next door because they are exemplar- well maintained homes andwell behaved children. My next door neighbor fits another mold- loud, screamingdisturbed grandchildren, barking dogs, some maintenance- ghetto. So far i havebeen called a white bastard and motherf&*^. I explained that in mysubculture we generally wait for marriage to have children and I was bornlegitimate; and that when I was single I had indeed dated mothers, but never myown, another subculture thing.But then on the other side of my house I had at one time Latinoneighbors who fit that mold. When they moved the renters were white and goodneighbors except they had a child who was deeply disturbed and created troublesuch as throwing a rock through the screen of a TV I set out for pickup.  I admired the black families across the streetfor letting their children play with him, until it became too much for themalso. It really is a matter more of will you maintain your property and respectyour neighbors then race; but, I think we are usually more comfortable dealingwith jerks of our own race because we grew up with such people. But yes, I wouldlove to see my ghetto neighbors move somewhere they would fit into.</comment>

<comment>Yuck - I like a nice environment with normal minded people. Even the best people can let their dogs bark incessently, or let their kids wander around and play on other people's property. Some of this has to do with lack of self-awareness, not Race. Maybe it's based on Class. </comment>

<comment>"... it always surprises me the financial lengths that markedly racist people are willing to go to insulate themselves from ethnically...diverse neighborhoods..."Does that apply to blacks who want to live in black neighborhoods?</comment>

<comment>I've never heard any of the many white people I know ever ask those two questions.However, they do ask questions like this: if I buy in this up-and-coming, not-so-great part of town will I be able to get a decent return on my investment sometime in the future? How long will that take? Will I be safe in this not-so-great part of town while I'm an owner? If I start a family here, will my kids be safe and are the schools acceptable?In my experience, most white people are pretty well conditioned to not have a knee-jerk aversion to non-white people. But to the extent they do have any aversion it's usually based on personal experiences of not feeling safe.</comment>

<comment>"I don't want my kid being beat up on the way to school." " I don't want him exposed on a daily basis to trees dying from too much urination or needles floating in a gutter." are typical concerns of parents of all shades.</comment>

<comment>Why do black kids need white kids to do better?  Why is that white, and asian communities do just fine, yet the only way for blacks to succeed is to have a healthy amount of whites around?</comment>

<comment>Whites are apparently magical. Just being near us makes people better.</comment>

<comment>Yet some ppl - Democrats - continually blame us for everything that is wrong in society, yet if we would only live with other folks, send our kids to school with those other kids and work with these other folks, they would do so much better.  For a group - whites - whoa re blamed for every ill in the world, these others really want to be part of our world.  Hell they will even put their kids on trains and send them thousands of miles just to be with us.  Honestly I LOVE being white.  we are the best by far</comment>

<comment>These people never send their kids to public schools either.  Rahm?  No.  The Clintons?  Obamas?  No and No. Most people in Chicago move when their kids reach school age.  Dem elites just send them to Parker, Latin or Lab.</comment>

<comment>It is my favorite thing about white liberals - they practically masturbate to Obama, and call any criticism of him racist, yet the moment they or their family actually have to interact with black ppl - they run away!.  Oh you forgot Matt Damon, who for years preached about the public schools and liberal values, yet in LA he saw the schools were 55% non-white and he sends his kids to private non-union all white schools!  BRAVO MATT</comment>

<comment>To be fair, Jimmy Carter sent his daughter Amy to predominately black DC public schools.</comment>

<comment>That is good to know- Carter was principled.  Does anyone doubt schools would be better if elites had skin in the game?</comment>

<comment>Yes, which is why in affluent suburbs, the public schools are excellent.They aren't free, however, they are paid for with (higher) taxes on inflated property values. But, unlike private school tuition, an overpriced house can be sold at an overpriced rate when you're done with it.Integration is hard and requires a bunch of things to go right to work. One of the few successful integration programs was in Wake County, NC (Raleigh). The key to its success was old to use the old urban schools in Raleigh as magnet schools for suburban kids. White people wanted to send their kids in. A side effect of this was that the natural attendance pattern was to move kids out instead of in. (For example, if you were halfway between an inner-city school and an inner-ring suburban school, you went to the inner-ring school, as opposed to having an ever geographically expanding inner-city school zone.) This took pressure off the suburban schools and integrated the population.That being said, Raleigh had several advantages that many cities don't. Raleigh is a relatively small city in the center of a very large county. The population of Wake County, like many Southern counties, resembled a "checkerboard" more than many heavily segregated northern cities. Nor did the plan include Raleigh's poorer, blacker, sister city of Durham, which is in a different county. (In Durham, affluent parents move across the county line toward either Raleigh or Chapel Hill or use private schools.) Finally, eventually, the suburbs grew so much that even voluntary busing to magnet schools became impractical for many parents.Even so, integration doesn't account for "neighborhood issues". Where I live now, the schools are actually terrible (teachers teaching the test, apathetic administration), but you'd never know it because the demographics are excellent (college town) and the school blows the doors off the standardized tests. Conversely, schools that are, in fact, excellent may test poorly due to their own demographic issues.</comment>

<comment>I have read about those of European descent not liking the fact that their children in Silicon valley have to compete in school with those of Asian or East Asian descent. So whatever this magic is it seems to not work in some circumstances.</comment>

<comment>Different races have different educational needs. Don't confuse racial realism with white supremacy.</comment>

<comment>Edit: Eurasian.</comment>

<comment>me thinks it has to do with underfunded education in poor communities.  So long as schools remain funded mostly with local property taxes, inequlity in education will remain a problem. Even if there was the money for a program to attract (pay) top educators to schools in poor districts, it would not be allowed by the teachers uniions due to seniorority rules.</comment>

<comment>Unlikely. The District of Columbia has the highest per-pupil spending in the country and is 75% African-American. If funding were the problem, they would be close to first rather than dead last in actual educational attainment.</comment>

<comment>Wow, didn't know that. Can you share source data?</comment>

<comment>I've heard this too, and I think the Atlantic had an article on it. But here's an article I found on a quick search that should back up what he's saying, http://www.heritage.org/resear...Skip down to "Results" for TL&DREdit: woops sorry, I guess this backs up steelers comment above, still same general point though.</comment>

<comment>I try not to use sources that are readily identifiable as conservative, libertarian, or otherwise right-wing, like Heritage. All too many netizens are addicted to the ad-hominem fallacy. Better to work harder and find a less impeachable source.So, this article requires a little digging, since the educationist author plays a little bit of hide-the-banana, but it pretty clearly shows that my base assertion is correct: http://blogs.edweek.org/edweek...See also: https://nces.ed.gov/programs/d...And I used an out-of-date statistic for the racial breakdown. DC schools are only 67% Black: http://dcps.dc.gov/page/dcps-g...</comment>

<comment>It's well established and easy to determine how much each state spends on students.</comment>

<comment>State level contribuions are usually a small percentage of total cost. I think Minnesota is the highest.</comment>

<comment>Most of the highest per pupil spending districts are majority minority.  In fact per spending per pupil is a poor yardstick for student performance.  What IS a good yardstick is the % of students in 2 parent homes</comment>

<comment>Or one parent homes with one or two kids that are the result of divorce. Never marrying and creating litters that fit the model of generational poverty and illegitimacy is a whole 'nother issue, usually parallel to high rates of unwed teen births and high school droputs.</comment>

<comment>Maybe blacks are exactly what they said in the 19th century - white man's burden</comment>

<comment>Most states provide some kind of state aid to poor schools if they don't fund them directly.  There isn't some great disparity in funding.  Maybe there was at one time but not recently.</comment>

<comment>And along those lines---if black kids can't do better without white kids, you're saying that ithe effect of the peer group around the students has a huge impact. THat may be great for blakc kids, but it explains even more why white families flee when black families move in.</comment>

<comment>I know this may sound blasphemous to Atlantic's liberla readers, but people are driven by self interest not racism.  Looking at the current state of the black family ( and the direction of the Latino family) whites are terrified to put their kids into a system where their peers are of such at risk children.  I would not want my kids in that stew.  It is hard enough raising a child, why should my child be a crutch for some black kid who's family life is a wreck, daddy's long gone and all the indices for failure is surrounding these children.  BTW - this author had his address checked and yes his family is an upper class expensive all white neighborhood.  lets integrate his kids first and see what happens</comment>

<comment>"but people are driven by self interest not racism"We are all driven by self-interest. The question is, are you acting in your own self-interest when you behave in a racist way?</comment>

<comment>No matter what the people looked like, I'd want safety.  If a nearby neighborhood were white or Latin, and unsafe, I'd not want to live there.</comment>

<comment>There are some fairly easy to explain answers to these questions if I thought you were asking them in good faith.</comment>

<comment>Haplogroup R1b Y-DNA?</comment>

<comment>Let me guess....blah blah racism blah blah income inequality blah blah</comment>

<comment>So, yeah, not asking in good faith.  Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Some--white communities--meaning home to wealthier, better educated residents--do just fine. There are also many white-as-the-driven-snow rural/small towns, about dead former industrial or mining towns, and Appalachian towns that are absolutely nasty places to live. By and large when people discuss integration the frame is black kids moving into a wealthy community full of well-educated people, most of whom happen to be white.Northern VA doesn’t equate to one of the small towns around Scranton PA that saw it’s heyday end over half a century ago when the mines closed, or Owsley County KY, or an Iowa market town that’s seen it’s economy collapse as family farms disappeared and meth took over.</comment>

<comment>It isn't that the black kids need the white kids, but the other way around. The white kids need to have some exposure to people different from themselves and the opportunity to build friendships with some of them early in their lives.</comment>

<comment>No they say that integration helps black kids achieve more.  Liberals 'claim' it helps white kids, but it actually slightly lowers their test scores</comment>

<comment>Correct. Integration is so that white kids have enough racial sense to function in an integrated world.What? Did you think wealthy white people really give half-a-damn about whether poor black kids get an education?</comment>

<comment>To make myself a little more clear:It is time to end the notion that black people are somehow inferior and need to depend upon white people. It is quite possible in theory for black people to educate themselves in their own schools and lift themselves up with no help - other than getting out of their way - from white people.On the other hand, we do have this terrible reality of centuries of horrible relations between whites and blacks, where whites have not only failed to get out of the way of the blacks, but have gone far beyond that in oppressing, exploiting, and harming them in so very many ways. At the root of this entire history are a set of pervasive attitudes on the part of most white people that see themselves as superior to black people, who they in turn view as inferior to justify both disparaging words and discriminatory (or worse) actions. Even in those cases where whites have tried to act more kindly toward blacks, it has managed to come off more as the condescension of superiors toward inferiors rather than as genuine equality. I would hope that I shouldn't have to make the case at this late date that this needs to change, and we still have much work to do to change it. My contention is that keeping whites segregated and isolated from blacks will do nothing at all to help with the widespread and profound changing of attitudes.It is not so much that blacks "need" whites to change attitudes for the sake of the blacks themselves, but rather because it is to the MUTUAL BENEFIT of both blacks and whites that we begin to make serious and sustained progress away from the bad old days of the past. Beginning to actually study and work and live in integrated communities is the necessary condition for this to happen.</comment>

<comment>You're not talking about integration.  You're talking about assimilation.  In my view, as someone who arrived here as a refugee, integration is something forced by the state, while assimilation is a state of mind.  The person him/herself becomes assimilated, and adopts, accepts and learns to love his (new) country.  A LOT of the original identifying culture is lost in that process, however.I do not consider black people to be fully assimilated.  Sure, they're integrated, and countless lawsuits, agencies, laws, and the state have forced integration, but integration does not bring assimilation.  Assimilation is voluntary, not forced.</comment>

<comment>I want someone to answer this question, just out of curiosity.  I can't even imagine what the answer to it might be.</comment>

<comment>Off the grid and away from most all humans ain't a bad thing.  I promise.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for this. It was extremely interesting to read Orfield. I now understand that the rabid right-winger Stanley Kurtz, author of "Spreading the Wealth: How Obama is Robbing the Suburbs to Pay for the Cities," is actually correct about everything.</comment>

<comment>Totally.  You should have seen Obama at a recent village council meeting.  He made us pass a mill levy increase and then convinced the aldermen to send all the new revenues to a nearby urban municipality via money order.  We were like "What?"  But that's how the power of the presidency can dominate village council politics.</comment>

<comment>People naturally segregate themselves based on IQ</comment>

<comment>More people do this based on crime rates and a decent environment in which to raise kids. Women, in particular, lean toward not being around violent men and predators whenever they can afford it.</comment>

<comment>Based on all kinds of things.  The rich segregate themselves based on their huge amounts of money.</comment>

<comment>I think most of us don't really care what color our enclaves are, just so long as they're "easy". We worked hard to make them easy, and we're not going to let ivory tower politicians change that.</comment>

<comment>And ultimately, those with means will ALWAYS be able to flee certain areas. Just the way it goes.</comment>

<comment>Professor Orfield lives in Minnesota, one of the whitest states in America.  An affluent college professor such as himself most likely lives in an affluent white progressive neighborhood.Most elite progressives who make a career out of telling middle and lower class whites that they should be living in more integrated areas - do not themselves live in integrated areas.A good example is Judge Arthur Garrity - who mandated forced busing on white South Boston in the 1970s.   Judge Garrity lived in Wellesley, Mass - 2 percent Black.</comment>

<comment>Surprising amount of commentary in favor of letting people live where they want.</comment>

<comment>Freedom always polls well.</comment>

<comment>Think of it like two bathtubs. One is full of hot water, over some nice burning logs. The other is full of ice cold water, being kept on ice. The hot water is the "good" schools/areas, with the white kids and better schools, etc. The ice water is the kids-of-color, poverty, etc.Now I see those who say that its very important to get the KoC into better areas. If you take ice water and pour it into a cup of hot water, the water is now much warmer than the ice water. So for the ice-water kids, this is a great deal. Unfortunately, for the hot water kids, this is a crap deal, they're now much colder water than they were before.And sure, small amounts of cold water into hot, or hot into cold, don't really make much difference. But when you start talking about more than token amounts, it does make a serious difference. The burning logs will in theory eventually warm the water back up to hot, but how long? And if you keep pouring cold water in? Never going to get back to hot water. And no parent is going to let their kids stay in that situation for longer than they can help it.For as much good as black kids get from being in predominantly white areas, those white areas take a hit for having the blacks around</comment>

<comment>It's a decent analogy. We keep trying to integrate too quickly, which is why you keep seeing white flight and the problem repeats. Because of what has happened in the past, blacks have pretty unstable families, which is basically the source of all these social ills. Integration needs to happen more gradually - over several generations - if we want to have any hope of it succeeding.</comment>

<comment>This is why the wealthy, especially  the liberals, love Overpriced  White enclaved neighborhoods, exclusive schools, and vacation spots. To keep out the riff raff. And why are these places eventually top-ranked? HmmmSorry liberals, you have no right to tell us we cannot do some of what you do! </comment>

<comment>Not sure how this is an exclusively liberal phenomenon, there are still Ben Carson signs all over the high-priced neighborhoods I bike through to work...</comment>

<comment>I did not say exclusively liberal, but they are the ones saying "Not for you, only for us".......SNOBBERY IS UGLY!!</comment>

<comment>So what's your quota? 10% Black people? 5% Black people are okay? We need to know so we can put exactly that many Black people near you--but not one iota more. Gotta make you comfortable.</comment>

<comment>Quotas are for 'progressives'.</comment>

<comment>My suggestion isnt quota-based--again too easy. The solution is not to dilute until you have two tubs of lukewarm water. But to keep the hot water hot, and look at what is being doing differently there, and apply to the cold water.Hmm, maybe start with tossing out the ice all around the tub. Maybe let it come to room temp, then add some logs, light on fire, and watch it heat itself up.This idea that integration is the only answer is offensive. It is offensive to whites who are painted as racists for not wanting to be dragged down by the poor and ill behaved. But its also offensive to blacks because it basically suggests that they themselves are helpless, that they can't possibly rectify their own situations, and that they are not responsible for changing their own behavior. This panacea of "throw them in with some whites" is an absurd approach. All you'll do is drive out the whites, and leave the blacks not really better off than they were before.</comment>

<comment>Its tempting I guess but I would rather avoid looking at it like something which is being diluted by something else.  I think of it more as distinct cultures and people simply want to be amongst their culture and don't like their culture being infiltrated with other cultures.  Exactly why one of those cultures needs the other one around to have decent schools and low crime is the big question I don't have an answer for.  And its not just a white/black thing.  I don't think most whites would want to live in a neighborhood that's 90% Asian or on an Indian reservation or something either.</comment>

<comment>I'm fine with integration if someone wants that, but I have to ask, what's wrong with a certain amount of living apart if people want that?Isn't that what multiculturalism is about - respecting the right of different groups to keep their identity and live how they wish within a country of many different groups doing the same thing?</comment>

<comment>Whites aren't allowed to have a culture other than the KKK and Nazis.</comment>

<comment>That's what the liberals keep repeating over and over.</comment>

<comment>Multiculturalism is okay....for non WASPs. If you're white, or basically not some special ethnic/racial/religious subset, you are supposed to respect the heck out of the different groups, be open, accepting, if they want to live in Little Italy, Chinatown, little Somalia, etc. But if you want the same respect, options--HA! Good luck with that--you'll be called racist before you can blink an eye</comment>

<comment>What you're describing is true, but very odd. You never hear articles about how hispanic areas of Los Angeles (for example) need to be desegregated by moving in black people. Or how black people need to be moved into the numerous rich Asian areas of the San Gabriel Valley.Always this incessant drumbeat that white people must live next door to black people, like it's a moral crusade. I don't even get the impression that blacks are clamoring to live with whites. It's just this weird agenda that the current generation of academics and policy-wonks are obsessed with. It's outdated.</comment>

<comment>The whites are the enemy, forever and ever and ever, ad infinitum.</comment>

<comment>Multiculturalism is an awful policy. It needs to be either pluralism (we all go our separate ways) or majoritarian monoculture. Trying to forge a single culture that respects everyone is a fools errand.</comment>

<comment>Especially when some minority cultures inherent beliefs are predicated on needing to convert everyone to be like them...</comment>

<comment>Or killing you if you're not like them.</comment>

<comment>There are good reasons why whites leave neighborhoods as the level of non-white goes up beyond 25 - 30%.  The initial group of non-whites in the neighborhood are often educated and desirable neighbors, but then as more non-whites move in, then undesirable people start to drift into the neighborhood, thinking they can fit in because there are already a lot of non-whites.  Then the crime rate goes up or neighbors that don't take care of their homes or cause trouble move in, and then the whites move out.  Just a few disruptive non-white people often are the catalyst for white people to leave.  While the issue of redlining and subprime loans is a really big problem, the more subtle problem of undesirable neighbors (noisy, dirty, rude, criminal etc.)  or badly behaved, aggressive classmates is really what keeps segregation continuing.  It would be interesting to see if white flight happens as often when there is an increase in minorities, but also a neighborhood association that does not tolerate nuisances.  My hypothesis is that in those neighborhoods, the nuisance people will stay away, and an increase in minorities will not cause significant white flight.</comment>

<comment>Bingo. Show me the stats on crime/police complaints for a neighborhood, both when it was mostly white, and then as the minority component increases. I bet in the cases where crime doesn't go up, white flight doesnt happen as much. In places where the crime rate matches the minority influx, of course you're going to have white flight.</comment>

<comment>I lived in a suburb of Toronto when I was a teenager with my family. We're brown and my dad had a very bad habit of listening to really loud music during the day (he worked from home). Our next door neighbours were a white family; the mom worked as a nurse during the nights and was home resting during the day. And the husband had a regular 9-5 job. They had a kid and were pretty quiet and used to ask my dad to keep the music down during the day so that the wife could sleep (since she was saving lives at the hospital during the night and all).My parents didn't give a shit. They'd do whatever they wanted, play music at all hours of the day, and the nice white couple next door would always come and very politely say to them what they had said several times before.One day they snapped, and I would have too in all honestly. The couple and my parents had a full-blown scream fest on our front porch that day. Threats were made, but nothing ever came of it. That nice family moved out of the neighbourhood a few short weeks after this incident and a new Asian couple moved in next door. The Asian couple and my family never even said hello to one another, and there was peace in the neighbourhood after that.Make of this story what you will, but I completely agree with everything you're saying here!</comment>

<comment>I think the black lives matter movement is starting to cause the opposite of their intentions. The race issue has been pushed too much, and we're sick of everything being a race issue.</comment>

<comment>Am I the only one that is bothered that the main strategy for integration is assigning "affordable housing" to predominately white neighborhoods? This seems inherently racist.</comment>

<comment>Civil Rights've been around for 50 years now. Integration failed. They need to get over it.</comment>

<comment>You've got it wrong. The main strategy is to make sure that affordable housing isn't put in a limited number of ghettos, which is what's happening now in places like Minneapolis. That means spreading it around throughout the county or city in a fair way.</comment>

<comment>The article says different. This is a quoted paragraph:"The 30 percent is when you’re thinking about trying to place housing, when you look at court decisions or school decisions—if anybody is interested in creating a long-term integration plan, they try to locate as much affordable housing in areas that are 70-percent white or more that aren’t in the pattern of transition."</comment>

<comment>It is built where people want to build it.  How exactly do you force someone to build where they do not want to build?  "You will build here!"  "Um no I would rather build my building over here."  *cocks gun* "Think again"</comment>

<comment>In the UK, what local authorities do is make the inclusion of affordable housing a requirement for the development to get consent from the town hall.So in a development of 300 homes, 10% must be 'affordable' by national standards. Of course this creates problems too - patches of relative poverty in oases of wealth mean that the helicoptered-in poor people can't afford their local shops.</comment>

<comment>What is the guest suggesting, to have racial quotas on neighborhoods?  This is a non-issue, people live where they want to live, and who are we to prevent them.</comment>

<comment>No one wants to live next to public housing, and if they can afford to move they will, white or black.</comment>

<comment>And its not because the public housing residents are black (or any other color). It's almost entirely due to the behavior problems and crime that seems to be endemic in public housing. No one willingly lives next to a high-crime, low-kept-up area if they can help it. Color doesn't matter--actions do</comment>

<comment>It works the other way around too.  Parents know that their children realize there are others that have more in the world, but do not want that fact continually thrown in their faces as the children walk around the neighborhood.  It is one thing to look at people living in fancy housing on TV or enjoying a Sunday stroll in a wealthy part of town, and another to walk to school each day past a block populated by rich kids who are ready to make fun of your clothing or hairdo.</comment>

<comment>So this.  I would up this by saying most homeowners don't want to live next to dense housing period, even classy condos, let alone public housing.  The suburbs aren't just about white flight.  They are also built on an entirely different housing model than the urban center.  If you bring the urban center to the suburbs (dense housing) people are going to move because most people in the suburbs are in the suburbs specifically because they don't want dense housing. </comment>

<comment>"As long as many white people choose to move out of suburbs as they diversify, one law professor argues, residential segregation will remain common."The author's modifier is dangling....</comment>

<comment>Lets put up some public housing in the hollywood hills, that I would love to see.</comment>

<comment>As far as I can tell, integration is important because either:A. Due to Jim Crow, it's assumed that spatial segregation leads to a "Separate and unequal" system for public/private resources. This is accurate in some areas, but not universal anymore. There are ways to resolve that, if the issue is funding/amenities. As one reader pointed out, the Washington D.C. area schools are very well funded but low on performance per student. Or...B. The hope is that, through exposure, the negative elements of black culture will be rooted out. No one ever talks about it, but that seems to be the under-current assumption. If your neighbors aren't up past 11PM and seem to be perfectly normal members of society, then children see these examples as how to live. If your neighbors are up all hours of the night with music blaring and doing drugs in public, then those same children will see them as examples instead.If it's option B, it's an admirable goal but you can't expect people to want to live next to street-oriented families for the greater good without compensation or advantage.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps some of the problem here is that race has become this neat little trick for glossing over the real problems. It's easier to frame this as an issue of whites being racist, than to perhaps look deeper at what causes lack of integration, and what's different in the places that it does work.Because while I dont disagree there are still some die-hard racists around, I think far more often it has nothing to do with skin color. It has everything to do with actions, with behavior, with the generally accepted "norms" of an area, and whether newcomers can and do assimilate into that norm, or whether they refuse to or are unable/unwilling to do so. No one wants to address that a lot of white flight is driven by the reality that crime is much more prevalent among young black men, than among white middle class families. If these black folks were coming into neighborhoods, and assimilating, or at least not outright standing out and rebelling in the face of the generally accepted norms (or even basic common decency/respect), I doubt you'd see much white flight.White flight happens when people notice harbingers of even more future bad behavior--loud music later in the evenings, more cars around, lawns taking longer and longer to get cut, bushes not being trimmed, revolving door of people in and out. No, those things arent necessarily illegal, but they are pretty decent indicators of future behavior patterns</comment>

<comment>For some reason neighborhoods go all to hell when Blacks move in and I always thought it was because they moved in. Now we discover it's because Whites move out. Hey...I think we knew that already didn't we? lol</comment>

<comment>Racism will continue to be America's handicap as long as we let it.But there is no shortage of guiding lights for how we can do better.There are cities where we see "white flight" and then unsustainable, bad managed, throw-away suburban development.And then there are healthy integrated communities that will be built to last and prosper for the long run.The sooner we go away from the former and toward the latter the better we off we will all be.</comment>

<comment>There are many White communities that are built to last and prosper in the long run. Most of them probably.</comment>

<comment>Yeah right. Couple of non-white move in, and watch them freak out and run.</comment>

<comment>They don't freak out and run. They make a very smart, considered decision to relocate their community. Especially when nonWhites Are willing to pay so much for a house in a White (but not for long) neighborhood. </comment>

<comment>Should they be held captive?</comment>

<comment>Of course not.  See my top post.The point is that we are free - FREE - to do a lot of stupid dumb things. Like be racist.That's part of our freedom, part of our burden.Only when we OPT to mature as A PEOPLE... will we find a true sense of community that isn't throwaway.</comment>

<comment>People have a right to run from drive-by shootings.  It's called survival.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, we always can default to fear.</comment>

<comment>If you want to put yourself in harm's way, that's your prerogative.</comment>

<comment>Recap of thread: so NOT moving out of your exclusively white community when a non white moves in constitutes putting yourself in harms way?"Got it."</comment>

<comment>If you want to invite deprecating values and standard of living into your community, that's fine.  But stop calling people racist for not wanting to live around that.  It's not righteous, it's inane.One family moving into a neighborhood isn't really what this is about, is it?  That's an over-simplification that provides you the opportunity to lecture.As other commentors have pointed out, this isn't as much a race issue as it a class-behavior issue.  Yes, people want to live around others that also take pride in increasing the value of their investment.  Taking care of their property, the lawn, the neighborhood, the schools.  Why is that racist?Why is choosing to live around blight, negligence, and violence viewed as righteous?  What the hell is wrong with you?</comment>

<comment>why do you assume that people of different color are less affluent?  The neighborhood property prices are the same for whites and non-whites.</comment>

<comment>I don't - there are many, many people of color that do much, much better than I do.  There's no disagreement there.Again, skin color isn't the issue.  It's assimilation to the values of the neighborhood that's important to me.  And, as I listed before, those values are taking care of the property, being respectful neighbors, being involved in the school system, etc.  If those neighborhoods that adhere to those values happen to be predominantly white, then so be it.  If people want to move in that also adhere to those values happen to be a different skin color, great!But, I don't want to live around Section 8 housing.  I don't want to live in high-crime areas.  I don't want to live in neighborhoods with crappy schools.  And if those neighborhoods happen to be predominantly comprised of people of color, there's nothing I can do about that.  But I get to make that choice.  Not you.  Not some self-righteous city planner.  And not Bernie Sanders.Stop f'n calling people racist for wanting to live in safe neighborhoods for their families.  That's not racism.  </comment>

<comment>UP to a point sure.But the devil is in the details.its all about allowing for assimilation. An opportunity must be given.</comment>

<comment>How sad it is to be a writer for the Atlantic and sent to Minnesota during the cold of winter to interview this nobody living and working in same said horrible state.</comment>

<comment>Hm, I'm not sure that's what's sad here.</comment>

<comment>So... let's read between the lines here a bit.  The author of this piece is saying/not-saying that the quality of life for minorities is directly affected by their proximity to white people.  The closer they live to white people, the better their lives.  Hmmm... where to begin.  Is the author implying that minorities are unable to achieve a higher standard of living without help from their enclave?  Aren't we relegating minorities to permanent underclass status by doing so?</comment>

<comment>Good point. But aren't all white people evil?</comment>

<comment>I'm not evil.  But I am mildly "disgruntled".</comment>

<comment>It only makes sense by applying hypocrisy and double standards</comment>

<comment>I really don't care what race my neighbors are, but I do care what kind of house my neighbors keep both because of property values and just my own personal happiness. After fighting tooth and nail to get out of apartments and into my own house, the last thing I would ever want is to have more apartments open up right next door to me with all the noise, traffic, trash, and other issues that comes with it.  When humans live packed together like rats, problems ensue; it doesn't matter how classy or trashy the apartments are.  Just one example that plagues you in apartments: doesn't matter how immaculate you keep your place, if your neighbor is a slob and lets his place get infested with roaches, they will end up in your apartment too.  No thanks. </comment>

<comment>Geez. What kind of apartment complex did you live in?</comment>

<comment>A large middle class gated one.  Followed by a large lower middle class non gated one most recently.  I've also lived in dorms, university apartments, and a small apartment building that only had 5 units in the swankiest neighborhood in the small city I lived in at the time.  Only one was in a dodgy part of town (and that was because my urban college was itself in a dodgy part of town).  I've had problems in every single mass housing place I've ever stayed that ran from noise to cockroaches to parking issues where people would clog up the lots with 2 or 3 jalopies a piece.  Most of these places were predominantly white so the issues don't just stem from race.  They were also in 3 different cities (Shreveport, Houston, and LA) ranging from small to enormous so the problems seem to persist no matter where you are. </comment>

<comment>White attitudes toward blacks (on average) have much more to do with class than race. Middle-class and above whites have problems with low-status, low-class behavior (by any racial/ethnic group). At the same time, many whites are quick to develop stereotypes about all blacks and to view the same type of (low-class) behavior in blacks as a bit worse than that by comparable whites.Because a lot of blacks identify with lower class norms and low-class culture, blacks understandably view white attitudes towards them as comments on their race, and not comments on their behavior or class. Add common stereotypes to the picture, and blacks have reason to feel mistreated and disrespected.It's a frustrating stalemate. It'll be with us until the race-class connection can be broken, which will take a lot of effort by all sides.</comment>

<comment>The root-cause of these types of issues is almost always liberals. Because of liberals, the poor are encouraged to stay poor, are encouraged to live in substandard housing,are encouraged to have children out of wedlock and are locked into a "living wage" of $7.25 an hour. We need to stop blaming minorities and start placing the blame where it belongs: Liberals, the Federal Govt and the sleazy mainstream media.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure Conservatives can fix all these issues without any problems.</comment>

<comment>By "conservatives", if you mean "Republicans", then NO. If by "conservatives" you mean "Libertarians", then YES.</comment>

<comment>Eileen, I think I love you.</comment>

<comment>Liberals need the votes, and they get the vote by convincing minorities that they're helpless victims, forever victimized by the evil white man.</comment>

<comment>And I’ve wondered how much of the class problem is due to being unable to read subtle signals. If I’m out in a local mall and I see group of white HS-aged kids I can pick up on the cultural signals they manifest--a bunch of middle-class friends out for a bit to get something to eat, chat up any girls they see and know, and maybe buy something. I can tell, without being able to tell you how I know, if they’re the previous or a group of kids out to start a fight. If I see a similar group of black kids I don’t know what the subtle cultural signals are, that will tell me HS friends vs street gang vs start of flash mob going wilding.</comment>

<comment>I wonder what it is about majority black neighborhoods that people want to move away from them.?</comment>

<comment>Crime poor schools decreasing property values</comment>

<comment>Hmmm... Good point! I wonder if there's any possible correlation between crime, poor schools, decreasing property values and ethnicity?</comment>

<comment>Correlation only if you ignore similar white areas. I’m sure Owsley County KY, Dickson City PA, or Keyser WV would welcome your presence.</comment>

<comment>The only people who want integrated neighborhoods are the people who live in the most segregated.  This is why I just told the wife, despite my holding values that directly conflict with the progressive liberal agenda, (anti -- abortion, SSM, et al) I am currently looking to live right smack dab in the middle of some of America's most progressively liberal neighborhoods and cities.  Why?  Because they are made up almost exclusively of rich white people.</comment>

<comment>True!  White liberals who are doing financially well are the first ones to move to a white enclave.</comment>

<comment>Such an old fashioned view of suburbs this Law prof. has.  I grew up in the DC suburbs in the decades after the negro riots.  It was all very white and new.  The city was dangerous, full of crack-crime and unemployment and Marion Barry-led corruption. There were jobs though. I worked all my summer jobs in the city.  Seems like the professor wants blacks to get a slice of those kinds of suburbs.  But as my generation moved downtown, shortly after the gays pioneered in the early 90s, I saw many happy black people with awesome lines of home equity as they gradually sold off, one by one, their downtown homes for massive profits. Many good jobs for all races in the DC area, there are large wealthy predominantly black suburbs in southern PG County and many blacks living in the other suburban counties too.  Quite apart from blacks and whites, the great story of the last 30 years has been the rise of asians and hispanics, from the first trickle of boat people and central American war refugees in the 1980s to the flood of today.  The suburbs of Montgomery County are increasingly minority, run down, and full of 'cash only' businesses.  The GenX and GenY university-educated youth -- of all races -- prefer to live and work in downtown DC, NY, SF, Boston.  Suburbs have been in decline -- not measured by racial composition, but by average income -- for nearly a decade now, since the 2008 crash. Many suburban municipalities in California are going bankrupt.</comment>

<comment>Its an interesting article, and Orfield is a serious academic, but there is some cherry picked data here.The comparison of Detroit and Louisville schools, with the suggestion that school integration was maintained in L'ville because a metro area desegregation order was kept in place, while Detroit schools have re-segregated because the metro area desegregation order against Detroit was lifted, ignores the elephant in the room - the economic trend in both cities. Detroit was the 5th largest city in America in 1970 with a population of 1.5 million, while L'ville had a population of 361,000.  Forty years later, Detroit has a 2010 population of 711,000, more than a 50% decline, while L'ville has experienced 100%+ growth in population and in 2010 is bigger than Detroit with a population of 741,000. I suspect that the economic trends in both areas had a far greater impact on schools generally and integration particularly than did the court orders.</comment>

<comment>Paying a settlement is proof of nothing.</comment>

<comment>Nothing is proof of anything according you hacks who are the force behind the white supremacy doctrine...</comment>

<comment>Lets dig down to see where you really stand on this.  So for risk assessment you have units who you are attempting to place risk onto, these units would be all the potential borrowers.  so you start identifying properties about those borrowers, these properties you run reports on to see if there is a correlation with risk.     Is your contention that there are certain no-no properties which can not be added to the equation (like zip code for example) or is it that if the result of all your properties starts segmenting the risk on racial lines the properties as a set should be outlawed?</comment>

<comment>You are ranting again.  The bank loans were studied and they charged more for the same risk from the black population.  That is why they had to pay fines because they were found to have acted via racist conduct.</comment>

<comment>So lets be clear: if a bank runs a correlation algorithm with the properties income, zipcode, and credit score, and the risk value comes out worse for one group of borrowers than another, that is legit, regardless of the races of the borrowers?</comment>

<comment>Lets make it clear, you have no data and debating  what is a fact and where the banks were charge for racial profiling to hack the loan rates.You have nothing but a claim that banks are not involved in racial profiling white the data proves otherwise.</comment>

<comment>I am debating what constitutes racial profiling in lending.  Are you willing to present your view on the issue?</comment>

<comment>I am talking way more specific than the Atlantic story you posted (or are you referring to some other reference?)I am trying to engage you at the heart of this debate, but you are not willing to go there.</comment>

<comment>It is clear that you know nothing about the case and are merely cheer-leading for the government.   If you are unwilling to talk about the specifics , then answer me this,: why did the government agree to settle and let countrywide admit no wrongdoing instead of letting the court rule on if the action was illegal?</comment>

<comment>CountryWide was a horrible bank that made poor loans to people of all races. But its prey wasn't the debtors, but the institutions to which it sold the bad loans.White supremacy as a philosophy ended fifty years ago. Only the new breed of Black racists like Coates believe in it. Countrywide had more than its fair share of minority personnel.</comment>

<comment>No it targeted the black folks more than rest and that is a fact.   The banking industry lobbied for self regulation and this what it produced, a  financial lynching industry.     An industry that would target the black folks.    Using black folks in an industry that use white supremacy doctrine as bait is part of the methodology .The white supremacy doctrine has not ended and you see the posts on this board and all the time in defense of white supremacy and you are here to paint it .   That is all despite evidence, and you are here  to allow for it continue.</comment>

<comment>No, it did not. In fact, during its glory days, Countrywide prided itself in giving loans to people who were not creditworthy for others. It was too aggressive in making loans, which is why it was a bad bank.Five years earlier, before the crash in 2008, the same writer would have been celebrating Countrywide for its boldness in making these loans.</comment>

<comment>They havd given sub prime loans to people that had qualified for prime rate loans.   Their business of hacking was to trap  a lot of people into subprime loans.The bullshit that you claim via "would have" is a hacked doctrine by those that were in business of painting it to make the victim of the industry as the source of the problem for their lynching loan business, typical of white supremacy doctrine.</comment>

<comment>The hell it was a hacked doctine. The whole mess was the result of (a) Wall Street business types that needed grist for the mills, and (b) aggressive social engineers that wanted to put people in homes they really couldn't afford.Back in the day, the subprime was supposed to be a starter loan that you'd cover by refinancing when you got a little ahead or the home appreciated in value. Only they didn't appreciate in value, too many borrowers never got ahead, and the whole thing collapsed.Bringing race into it is patronizing as hell. Blacks were as capable as anyone else of reading the fine print. The idea was that you weren't going to still be in the loan when the starter rate kicked off. It didn't work out that way, but that has nothing to do with race. EVERYONE made the same idiot assumption that housing values would continue to rise.</comment>

<comment>No that is the typical lies that the financial  industry has buffed.  The evidence shows that they had hacked it to profit from it.Subprime = higher interest rates = more profit  for the commercial banks and the  investments  banks  hacked the securitazation to dump the debt on pension funds basically..   it was full blown fraud from bottom to the top""Goldman to Pay Up to $5 Billion to Settle Claims of Faulty Mortgages""""More than seven years after the worst of the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs is again paying a price for the role it played.The Wall Street firm said on Thursday it had agreed to a civil settlement of up to $5 billion with federal prosecutors and regulators to resolve claims stemming from the marketing and selling of faulty mortgage securities to investors.Goldman announced the settlement — the final terms of which are still being negotiated — after the markets closed.Goldman, which is scheduled to report fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday, said the settlement would reduce earnings in that period by approximately $1.5 billion on an after-tax basis.The agreement in principle requires Goldman to pay $2.385 billion in civil penalties and $875 million in cash and provide up to $1.8 billion in relief to consumers.Bank of America in 2014 paid about $16.6 billion in a similar settlement with federal and state agencies, and JPMorgan Chase paid about $13 billion in 2013. In all, the banks have paid more than $40 billion in settlements to resolve claims investigated by the task force....In 2010, Goldman paid $550 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission for its role in putting together a collateralized debt obligation called Abacus. That bundled deal of subprime mortgage securities resulted in losses to investors. But the so-called synthetic C.D.O. was constructed in such a way as to allow another investor to profit by shorting, or betting against, the mortgage securities that were packed into the investment vehicle.The settlement in principle that Goldman announced on Thursday did not involve C.D.O.s, but more traditional mortgage-backed securitizations.The deal resolves claims arising from Goldman’s underwriting and sale of mortgage-backed securities from 2005 to 2007, during a period leading up to the financial crisis and a sharp decline in home prices across the country.""http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01...</comment>

<comment>Subprimes are LOW interest rates.Better do some reading.</comment>

<comment>No you are wrong.  You have to be really clueless and under a rock to say that.  How clueless can you be.  Hopefully you are not the financial wizard of your family.. or they will be bankrupt soon"" Subprime loans tend to have a higher interest rate than the prime rate offered on traditional loans. The additional percentage points of interest often translate to tens of thousands of dollars worth of additional interest payments over the life of a longer term loan.""Read more: Subprime Loan Definition | Investopedia http://www.investopedia.com/te...</comment>

<comment>Dead wrong.The subprime rates are much lower than prime. (Er . . . that's what SUB-prime MEANS). Why they were condemned - after the fact - is that they are not the final rate. They're a teaser rate for the first 12 or 24 months, after which the real rate kicks in, which is a lot higher. That's the crux of the consumer complaint.What was pretty clear after 2008 wasn't at all clear before. THEN, people congratulated Countrywide for making those loans. Both Republicans and Democrats wanted to see increased home ownership. The notion of most sub-prime debtors is that they'd obtain conventional financing at a lower rate, or refi as the house gained value. That didn't happen.Do some reading, and get the chip off your shoulder.</comment>

<comment>You clueless one, I posted a reference, you on other hand are just ranting.  Sub means subpar or sub quality but it has higher rate because they associate higher risk with those loans.You are a fraudster, period who would lie even in presence of documentation and that is how you hacks played the bankster's games too.</comment>

<comment>What I have done is expose you as a complete ignoramus. 'Prime' does not refer to the quality of a loan like a grade of beef, you moronic ass. It refers to an interest rate.Look up 'subprime loans' on Wikipedia, and stop making a fool b of yourself.</comment>

<comment>"same risk",   How to come to that risk value is key to this debate.    As a bank I develop my own method of assigning a risk value, the justice department when bringing their case no doubt has their own way of determining the risk.  So is your position that there is only one correct way to determine risk and if the lending doesnt adhere to that risk determination then it can be illegal?</comment>

<comment>The primary reason affordable housing is concentrated in urban areas with noise and traffic and not in suburban areas with half acre manicured lawns has nothing to do with race and everything to do with public transportation.Where I live there isn't a bus, train or taxi for 10 or 15 miles.  What good does it do a poor person to live without reliable transportation?   Most people recieving government subsidies on housing can't afford cars, insurance, repairs, etc.  </comment>

<comment>One of the primary reasons that poor people can't get ahead is due to the govt subsides that encourage them to stay put and stay poor.</comment>

<comment>From the study:"Income is not a perfect proxy for credit-worthiness. For instance, lenders also use credit scores to judge risks. It is possible that non-white and white applicants with identical incomes have different credit scores on average. This could happen if white incomes were more stable over time, for instance."If you show that folks with the same credit scores were treated differently, or that credit scores are poor indicators of credit worthiness, then you have made your case. Proceed with the remedy.But i doubt you can show that.</comment>

<comment>I lived in a suburb of Toronto when I was a teenager with my family. We're brown and my dad had a very bad habit of listening to really loud music during the day (he worked from home). Our next door neighbours were a white family; the mom worked as a nurse during the nights and was home resting during the day. And the husband had a regular 9-5 job. They had a kid and were pretty quiet and used to ask my dad to keep the music down during the day so that the wife could sleep (since she was saving lives at the hospital during the night and all).My parents didn't give a shit. They'd do whatever they wanted, play music at all hours of the day, and the nice white couple next door would always come and very politely say to them what they had said several times before.One day they snapped, and I would have too in all honestly. The couple and my parents had a full-blown scream fest on our front porch that day. Threats were made, but nothing ever came of it. That nice family moved out of the neighbourhood a few short weeks after this incident and a new Asian couple moved in next door. The Asian couple and my family never even said hello to one another, and there was peace in the neighbourhood after that.Make of this story what you will, but I don't blame white people for their flight.</comment>

<comment>Imagine that you are a white person who has no problem with non-white neighbors, but also feels no obligation to remedy systemic racism or housing discrimination. This probably describes the majority of white people.If you buy in an integrating neighborhood, your property values will likely decrease. Therefore, it makes economic sense to avoid an integrating neighborhood if buying and to get out ASAP if you are in one. Nor is this a particularly pleasant choice: Frequently, it is the choice between a jumbo mortgage on an overpriced, but appreciating asset vs a normal, more manageable mortgage on a depreciating asset.This involves no animosity or personal prejudice toward non-white people. Nor do you even have to be white—affluent non-white people will play the same game if they are able.When people are willing to pay a premium for "Easy White Enclaves", housing discrimination will persist. If you try to fight it, people have an incredible economic incentive to work around it. </comment>

<comment>As an African-American, living in Memphis, I was and continue to be fascinated by the desire of other middle class African-Americans desire to move out of the city, into a $250,000 to $500,000 house, then turn around and commute back into the city for work, worship, and socializing.  Instead of playing that game, we purchased a two story home, built in 1925, in an inner city which is redlined.  The purchase price was $35,000.  We paid 50% down and financed it through Navy Federal Credit Union.  We purchased the empty lots on each side, walled in the property and renovated.  With the savings on housing we were and are able to place our children in magnet and/or independent schools.If people want to flee from me/us, that's their perogative.  We choose to take lemons and make lemonade.  Enjoy your commutes and chain eating establishments.  </comment>

<comment>I question the statement made in the article about blacks who make 157k per year are less likely to qualify for a prime loan than a white who earns 40k per year.  What is the reason for this?  Is it because the white person has a higher credit score?  It would be nice to know the entire story, some of these "facts" are not fully disclosed.  My experience has been that banks want to make a profit, they don't care where you live or what color your skin is.  </comment>

<comment>You are right to question the statement.</comment>

<comment>"A black family that earns $157,000 a year is less likely to qualify for a prime loan than a white family that earns $40,000."Looked through the 2009 report and saw nothing to prove this allegation.   But progressives don't need facts to make inflammatory allegations that stir up racial hatred.</comment>

<comment>Bottom of page 14, data methods included. They acknowledge that income is not a perfect proxy for credit worthiness, but cite prior research on the subject.</comment>

<comment>The fact that they pull out only race and income is suspicious.  What about loan to value?  Credit history?  Market value?  etc.etc.etc.  If this were racially as biased as they are making it seem, Minneapolis banks would have been sued out of business when the 2009 report came out.  As with the white police shoot unarmed black man narrative beloved by progressive racial grievance mongers in the media, I'll wait until all the facts are out.</comment>

<comment>" Hands up, don't shoot."</comment>

<comment>It's incredibly difficult for me to comprehend that there are people in this world - people of intellectual authority - that literally advocate for federal mandates to constrain people's abilities to move to where they wish, so long as the people targeted are white. I cannot comprehend that this exists to the scale that it does.How on Earth have people become so brainwashed by the soft-science talking points [of Gender Studies et al] that have disseminated throughout the Intelligentsia's framework, that we are now openly advocating on stopping and "de-incentivizing" people from living among whom they wish?Surely, there is both a more humane and more sensible solution to the problems that minority groups face than simply forcing (through mandated manipulation) whites upon minorities, and minorities upon whites. This is an incredibly dangerous mode of thinking, and antithetical to the classical liberalism from which America was founded, and to which the broader "humanism" of Orfield can be attributed. A worrisome trend, indeed.Ignore the tinfoil hat for a moment, but those who were once fearing a drive toward a global, borderless, nationless, monoculture of consumerism really do seem to have something to fear after all... The logic of Orfield can be found everywhere; moral authoritarianism abounds.</comment>

<comment>The people who support racist policies like HUD are racist. Its that simple.</comment>

<comment>It's almost like they have a fascination with destroying anything white people build for themselves.</comment>

<comment>I would love to know what Professor Orfield thinks about the recent lawsuit filed in Minneapolis about school segregation: http://www.startribune.com/law...I find his estimation that 30% minority population is a tipping point to be very interesting. I wonder what the tipping point is for schools. Having attended a very diverse elementary school myself, I wanted a school for my own children that is diverse, bit also is less than 50% children in poverty (much more than that seems to suck up too much of the teachers' energy dealing with it.) I'm now seeing the school grow wealthier and whiter, despite being in the city (only about a third of students are now in poverty).Given the slow pace of desegregation via building and moving, I don't see how we can wait for neighborhood change. Desegregating schools allows people to quickly mix together, without the same investment that housing requires. </comment>
