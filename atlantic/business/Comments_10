<comment>What would have been more interesting would have been to set up the experiment so that the monkeys would receive cucumbers for each of the first four rocks and only receive a grape for every fifth rock they gave the researcher. Then see what happens when one of the monkeys received the first grape after giving the researcher the fifth rock while the other monkey had still given the researcher less than five rocks. Would the monkey who had only given the researcher 3 or 4 rocks throw a fit for not getting a grape like the monkey got who had given the researcher 5 or more rocks?</comment>

<comment>Well here is what not to do - at my old job, I got moved from one group where I was mostly working the 9-5, into one where I had to work about 60 hours a week, without any change in compensation. I was supposed to see that as a reward because that group is "full of top performers". Got a new job in a few months and quit and they somehow acted surprised.</comment>

<comment>Similar thing happened to my brother, when he got a "promotion" without an increase in compensation.  They fired someone else, gave my brother his work in addition to my brother's current workload and a fancy title, but no raise.  My brother also quickly found another job.  Sometimes you have to wonder what management is thinking.</comment>

<comment>"what employees do have a big problem with is the sense that they’re being unfairly compensated in the great scheme of things"How "fair" was it that a plumber in Pittsburgh drove a Buick while a physician in Beijing drove a bicycle in the greater scheme of things?  Most people's idea of unfairness is when someone else gets more than they get themselves - not when they have more than someone else.  Did the monkeys who didn't get the grapes think things were unfair?</comment>

<comment>"even monkeys are incensed by income inequality—so it makes sense that humans are too"The monkeys used in this experiment are Capuchin monkeys - there is a description here:http://www.monkeyworlds.com/ca..."They are aggressive when it comes to their territory. The males are dominant in the Capuchin Monkey groups. They may fight among themselves for the role of leader and for mating. It is common for groups to have new leaders often due to the fighting among the males."The world belongs to those who dominate their instinctive reactions - not the other way around.</comment>
