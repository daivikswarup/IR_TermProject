<comment>Isn't the entire state of Missouri a prison anyways? Who would ever choose to live in a miserable flyover state like that?</comment>

<comment>Actually, MO isn't that bad.  It mirrors the woes seen in Michigan and other states though.However, I always made sure my gas tank was full so I wouldnt have to stop in St. Louis.</comment>

<comment>In many ways it does mirror Michigan. The large cities were taxed to pay for the suburbs expansion. After the jobs moved to the suburbs, there was a huge doughnut hole with all the wealth on the outside and poverty on the inside. The problems of Metro St. Louis can be seen in the same problems of any large Mid-West city.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, it made me think.  I don't completely agree, but to be honest I don't have enough background to go on to be really able to dispute your statement.  Regardless, made me think.</comment>

<comment>"Actually, MO isn't that bad.  It mirrors the woes seen in Michigan ..."___That's kind of like saying "Actually, my boyfriend isn't that bad; he does beat me though..."</comment>

<comment>So, why are the most racially segregated schools and housing i the US in NYC, CA, MD, DE, IL (okay TX is 5th).Oh, that's right. You have no idea what you are talking about.</comment>

<comment>NYC isn't a state, that's weird to include them in the list.</comment>

<comment>Which is true. it is also true that NYC is the most racially segregated place in the US.oh, I never said NYC was a state.</comment>

<comment>True.  There's segregation everywhere.  But what is segregation?People who are not assimilated, tend to segregate.  You can see this with the Vietnamese, with Cubans, with people who have their own very unique language, culture, music, food, and way of understanding the world.I'm very assimilated, so I live in a neighborhood that Cubans and black people might call, "anglo."  Into this block, moved a black family.  They do the normal things everyone does - garden and do repairs on the weekends, get together with people, etc.  However, they are not the friendliest people on the planet.  I've waved and said hi to them, and their response is lackluster.  Also, I've seen that they've thrown 2 parties, pretty big ones, and everyone, absolutely everyone who was invited, was black.  They don't try to blend in.  At least they don't try with me, or with a neighbor of mine who has said the same thing.Why am I even mentioning this?  I mention it because I've noticed that black people TEND to seek their own.  I've seen it in schools, in colleges, in neighborhoods, everywhere.  They seek their own in the same way that unassimilated Latins live in Latin neighborhoods because they feel so at home, so cozy with their own people.I keep hearing that black people are being shut out but I keep seeing how they seek out other blacks.  I'd like to hear a lot less of this, "Oh but they're being discriminated" when the fact is, that black people SEGREGATE themselves because they feel as comfy with their own, as Vietnamese feel with their own.</comment>

<comment>Of course they do. If I've seen it we all have. I live in a small rural town. A couple of black families. Very stand-offish. I wave (which is what we do in town) they never wave back. Never. Except the young boy (say 10) that goes to the town school. He is more acclimated to living in town. I don't even deny I am more comfortable with people like me.  But that is life and this is politics and the PC crowd is all up in arms. So I rattle their cages. The look down at the South while ignoring their own segregation.</comment>

<comment>Same with me!I'm sick and tired of the bs of trying to make it seem that whites are segregating blacks.  Blacks segregate themselves in the same way that Cubans do, in the same way that Vietnamese do, in the same way that any people with a strong and very different culture does.</comment>

<comment>It is bigger then them "not trying to blend in". First off, why do certain cultures have to "blend in" why can't they be respected for their differences but still live in areas that they have historically been kept out of.Next... Maybe you only saw black people at their parties because they know their coworkers view certain types of black people as trashy and hate rap and r&b music. I also have coworkers that are clearly uncomfortable around a lot of black people. I know this because I notice the verbiage they use when they describe certain situations, venues, and parts of the city where the people look like me. Would I love to invite my coworker to a big party...absolutely...but I honestly think they would uncomfortable. Most of my friends are professionals but I know from the outside we would just be seen as the loud blacks they hate being around when they accidentally find themselves in the minority. After I long week at work no one wants to be judged by coworkers for relaxing differently then them. That being said...I am still going to try it and give my non-black coworkers the opportunity to come. A lot of situations are uncomfortable at first and it takes both sides to get over it and realize we can all still have fun.Perhaps these people did that and the other races did not show or left early. Did you really sit there and watch the whole party and note everyone that entered? Next...how many others or non-blacks do whites have at their parties?None of this is the point of the article though. Yes people like to live by their own but there is a difference in SYSTEMATICALLY using laws and other semi-legal means to keep people from living in certain neighborhoods and not having a diverse house party.But please....don't judge a whole race because the ONE black family you know does not try to stop and hold a conversation with you when you wave. Lol...they moved to an "Anglo" neighborhood and you are still claiming they WANT to be segregated. They just might not be friendly with any type of neighbors.</comment>

<comment>""First off, why do certain cultures have to "blend in" why can't they be respected for their differences but still live in areas that they have historically been kept out of." I just gave you one of many examples in which blacks move into areas you claim they're not allowed in, but they choose to not become part of that area by ignoring the people who live there."Next... Maybe you only saw black people at their parties because they know their coworkers view certain types of black people as trashy and hate rap and r&b music."Maybe they have secret parties.  Could be.  The parties I saw, had people outside and they were all black."Would I love to invite my coworker to a big party...absolutely...but I honestly think they would uncomfortable."You're the one perpetuating the falsehood of racism.  Stop imagining monsters behind every rock."After I long week at work no one wants to be judged by coworkers for relaxing differently then them."Then they are segregating themselves, and neither you nor anyone have any cause for whining that they are being discriminated against."Did you really sit there and watch the whole party and note everyone that entered?"No.  You're right.  Maybe they do have a white friend they are nice to and who sneaked in.  They are certainly not nice to any of the people in the neighborhood""But please....don't judge a whole race because the ONE black family you know does not try to stop and hold a conversation with you when you wave."This is not the first time I've seen blacks self-segregating EVEN WHEN they move into a typically white area.  They self-segregate constantly.  I thought I made it clear that MANY cultures do that.  My own culture, Cuban, does that.  Vietnamese do it.  Chinese do it.  All kinds of cultures do it.STOP INVENTING CRAP ABOUT HOW VICTIMIZED BLACKS ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE SEGREGATED.  THEY SELF-SEGREGATE.</comment>

<comment>Your assumption excludes many other potential causes, economic and social.People, particularly immigrants, tend to live where they can get support so they gravitate towards their relatives and those of a simmilar culture. Another factor is the locations where government support is available. If these are concentrated the population using that support will concentrate where services are available. there is also the fact that poor people will concentrate where they can affored to live.That you seem to blame minorities for segregation based on your sample size of one shows that your looking to avoid making any changes and rather prefer that the minorities are responsible for cureing segregation.</comment>

<comment>That's not true.  Immigrants are used to their own, feel comfy with their own, don't have to put up their guard with their own, and so they seek their own.  People always always always feel most comfortable with their own.  Only someone who hates himself feels more comfortable with someone not like him.That you seem to blame whites for the self-segregation of minorities, clearly sounds like the typical liberal hatred of the West, of whites, of the family (extended and nuclear), of Christianity, of the U.S., and all the rest of the hatreds libs have.</comment>

<comment>I simply point out that there are multipul causes for segregation and that the sample size you cite for your fantasy is statistically useless.</comment>

<comment>Well,  me. I love the place. I will never go back to one of those blue boy crap holes with your outrageous taxes and your loss of freedom. Nope, I like it here.I live far better on much less money than I ever did in CA, NY or NJ. Had a house in NJ, kinda run down. Paid almost $8K a year in property +  school taxes. I paid my property tax this year, $400 on a house that is nicer in a very safe, friendly community. Paid cash for my house. For what the down-payment was in NJ. State income taxes are nominal compared to either CA, NJ or NY.Tell you what, feel free to fly over. That guy on the ground in NW Missouri? That's me giving you the finger.</comment>

<comment>Not in rural NW MO where I live.Now why are you giving 2009 tax data?Please notice that in one of your citations that MO is like 35th in taxes.MO is bookended by KCMO at one end and St. Louis on the other. Between them taxes are pretty nominal. Oh, don't compare rural property taxes with city property taxes.

<comment>My house in NJ cost just over $80,000. I paid $7600 a year in property and school taxes. I would pay more in taxes in 9 years than the house cost. Actually, more in just over 8 years. NJ mixes both property tax and school tax in one figure so your focus on "effective" property taxes is wildly misplaced. Now try again. You made an error on both my houses. Your "average" effective property tax rate is highly skewed downward by the much, much lower "effective" property tax rates on shore property. Very, very high evaluations but much lower "effective tax rates." A million dollar shore property in NJ (not a bit unusual, even common), would pay one hell of a lot of tax, but "effective" taxes not near as high as other places. Rural MO pays much lower taxes than you suggest.</comment>

<comment>My "effective" property tax rate in NJ was just under 5% (just looked it up). My tax rate in MO is just over $11 per thousand. MO only uses 19% of assessed value on average. NJ 100%.</comment>

<comment>The key is finding a way to fund the government that doesn't rely on fines, fee, etc.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. They should cut government spending, but they won't. Still doesn't answer the question- what's the penalty for speeding, driving without a license and parking in the middle of the street? Cause if there's no penalty, then there's no speed limit and everyone will double park. Which means people will call their state and local representatives and say "Do something!" which means there will be a penalty again and we're all right back to square one.</comment>

<comment>Riiiiight. It is all their fault.The problem is insufficient tax money to run  their cities properly. when the States all hopped on the "lower taxes" issue, one place they cut were the transfer funds to municipalities. That encouraged the locals to find other revenue sources, including fines.BTW, many of the issues are in neighboring cities that don't want blacks even in them, let alone living there.</comment>

<comment>"The problem is insufficient tax money" maybe because said residents don't pay taxes?BTW, you can't really blame them</comment>

<comment>Where did "they don't pay them" come from?The issue isn't paying property taxes; it's the value of those property taxes. The local government must pay the same for services to a $1,000,000 residence as it does to a 30,000 residence. Yet, the first will pay a lot more in property taxes than the second.Most municipalities rely on commercial and industrial taxes since they provide jobs and don't require schools. When a municipality has very little commercial or industrial tax base, then all the tax load goes on the residential property. Unless that tax base is wealthy, it will see a degradation in services.</comment>

<comment>The people that have the 1,000,000 residence don't want to be in an inner city, for obvious reasons.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't answer the "insufficient taxes" or your claim of "they don't pay taxes".</comment>

<comment>An inner city tax base will never be wealthy, so it will never support all those that take from it.</comment>

<comment>Yet, some insist on calling inner cities "cesspools" and degrade those who live there.</comment>

<comment>Would you prefer "toilets"?</comment>

<comment>I would prefer that you bigots all used your second amendment rights on each other.</comment>

<comment>Not how it works, we obey the law. The ones killing each other are your inner city buddies, which is why no one cares.</comment>

<comment>When did Missouri hop on the lower taxes issue? It's tax rate is virtually unchanged since 1977, from 9.4% then to 9.3% today (and the state collects more dollars in absolute terms because people's incomes are higher today): http://taxfoundation.org/artic...The real problem is with the government providing a lot of unnecessary services and paying its well-connected blue-collar employees double the wages and benefits of similar private sector employees. This is largely caused by the fact that most of the people who vote in local elections are municipal workers who have a vested interest in their own pay. Lower interest rates and investment returns are also a problem, because that has caused shortfalls in state pension funds, which need to be plugged with taxes.</comment>

<comment>Learn about the Hancock Amendment. It deeply restricted the ability of local government to raise taxes and prevented tax bills from rising as property values rise (by requiring municipalities to adjust rates downwards as values increased, but not allowing rates to be increased when values dropped last decade). You are looking at statewide numbers, which is mostly collected by the states. Local numbers are a patchwork of sales tax and property tax. These rates are surprisingly even, which means that poor cities that are taxing a much small tax base are bringing in a fraction of the revenue of commerce heavy cities rolling in sales tax.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? MO didn't do anything like that. You learn when blacks move in get the hell out. Your property values will drop, your CVS will get burnt down, your taxes will go up, your safety will go down and you will be stuck in some shat hole with bars on the window. Unless of course you are in some nice safe walled community. Than the good black Dr. Thompson down the street is nice.</comment>

<comment>This article seems to suggest that replacing these fines with taxes would solve the problem. But that wouldn't work because people also get arrested and go to jail for not paying their taxes. A better solution, not mentioned, is to cut "services" such as the police and jails used to enforce these fines, but also the many other local government services that seem to create jobs for officials' friends, but no real benefit to residents.This article also says that the residents of these towns lack the political power to stop these fines. Why is that? Don't these towns have elected officials just like most other towns?</comment>

<comment>I think what the author suggests is first that many of these offences "saggy pants" just shouldn't exist in the first place, and that secondly it is actually not lawful to imprison someone for a fine if they don't have the ability to pay it (but that the ability to pay is rarely checked by the court before imprisoning people).Lastly even if it was replaced by taxes, you don't tax someone with no income therefore those with no money would not have to fear prison because they wouldn't be taxed.Lastly do they have any candidates that are actually fighting for them on this topic.lastly lastly, do they even know the extent of the issue? can't see the forest for the trees?</comment>

<comment>I'm not a lawyer, but aren't people also jailed all the time because they can't pay child support? It seems like this issue isn't limited to or even primarily about local fines.Also, sometimes people are taxed on property, and they might not have liquid income to pay the taxes.If people cared about this issue enough, it seems like they could run a candidate against it. In local elections, after all, there is no 1% lobbying or racist majority preventing the residents from changing these policies.</comment>

<comment>You would think that conservatives would be happy to bash a blatantly abusive local government, as until recently, the ideological pillar of the Republican Party was controlling ridiculous taxes and fines (you know, "limited government"). Somehow, crickets from the Republican candidates on Ferguson. And they wonder why they're losing.I hope (but it's very unlikely), that the majority of Ferguson government winds up in the prisons they used to run.</comment>

<comment>You mean the Ferguson where the thief thug robbed a liquor store, then tried to take a Cop's gun, then was put down like the animal he was? That one?</comment>

<comment>I'm not seeing your point.</comment>

<comment>Of course not.  It doesn't fit your narrative.</comment>

<comment>Why not explain?</comment>

<comment>The point is that there was no abuse. What happened is exactly what should have happened.</comment>

<comment>Well, who is this guy that robbed the liqueur store and tried to take the cop's gun?</comment>

<comment>The dead thug</comment>

<comment>Did you mean Darren Wilson? The guy who lied to the investigators, and then the grand jury? The guy who shot a man with his hands up? That thug?</comment>

<comment>We all know that there was no "hands up". You are lying. The dead thug was the thug that should be dead.</comment>

<comment>Oh THAT dead thug. Nope, he is in hiding somewhere in Missouri. He can't work because he too afraid after murdering that black guy. But he does have to answer the questions in the civil suit. Maybe then the DA will convene a proper grand jury and put the guy's butt in jail where it belongs.Ya, I can see how a bigot would defend a worthless piece of trash like Wilson. It makes them feel good to know that others are "solving the black problem". Ya, bigots are like that.</comment>

<comment>So, the CC footage inside that convenience store that we all saw, that didn't happen either? He won't go to jail because he did nothing wrong. Why do you want to defend the dead thug?</comment>

<comment>Because Mr. F is in love with a lie</comment>

<comment>I don't know which liqueur store you are referring to. Apparently you don't either.</comment>

<comment>Because you are a liar</comment>

<comment>Mr. F is intentionally being disingenuous.  It was a convenience store, not a liquor store.  He could accept that fact that your point is accurate even if that detail was not.  Instead, he attacks you.  You can't converse with people like him</comment>

<comment>Of course he is, as usual.</comment>

<comment>For the sake of accuracy, it was a convenience store, not a liquor store (though it did sell liquor).</comment>

<comment>I've given up trying to hold a conversation with Mr. F.</comment>

<comment>Wait wait wait.  Wilson, the police officer, didn't shoot anyone with their hands up.  That story was roundly discredited by the eyewitness testimony.  You can still find charts showing which witnesses testified to what, and it was beyond question that Brown did not have his hands up when he attacked Wilson and was killed.Frankly I have no idea why that guy brought up the Mike Brown shooting based on the conversation you were having, but this stuff about how he had his hands up is an abject falsehood.  There's no reason to lie, there's about a million examples of the cops actually murdering people.  Jose Guerena, Eric Garner, Walter Scott, and tons more.  The Brown shooting was not an example of police brutality, that narrative was spun after the fact.</comment>

<comment>So you think it's good governance to fine somebody with no job? And then to attach to that fine an interest rate on late payment that triples or quadruples the amount owed in a 6 month to 1 year period?Then issue an arrest warrant, jail someone, pay the cost of jailing someone, incur a lawyer's time as a public defender, make said person pay court costs at sentencing, get a criminal violation on their record, and then continue to be unemployed?All while the white folks who happen to be in Ferguson don't get the same treatment, and municipal employees and friends and families of get exempted?You and I have a way different definition of "what should have happened."</comment>

<comment>Maybe spend your time looking for a job instead of "protesting" every time someone who deserves to be arrested gets arrested.</comment>

<comment>Sad that you think government exists to continue a cycle of discrimination and poverty. My guess is if it was you who had to pay a $1,000-fine (and this is not an exaggeration, see the DOJ's report), for an expired vehicle registration, you'd feel differently.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I would have paid the registration fee before it expired.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you would have. Except in Ferguson, your payment "wouldn't have processed," or "they wouldn't have a record of it, we need you to pay again, sorry," or "your check was lost in the mail."</comment>

<comment>what evidence do you have of that?</comment>

<comment>"Sir, if you continue to give me attitude, I'm going to have to notify security."</comment>

<comment>Your mommy must be very proud of the bigot she raised.</comment>

<comment>"What happened is exactly what should have happened."___Indeed: when people are stupid enough to spend time in the USA, sometimes they get shot. We all know this, but it's dickish of you to rub our noses in it.</comment>

<comment>Don't rob C stores, and don't attack a cop. I assure you, you won't get shot.</comment>

<comment>"I assure you, you won't get shot."___You're offering assurances you can't actually deliver.</comment>

<comment>If you're saying you actually think that innocent people don't get shot in America, then that would mean you're not a member of the reality-based community.</comment>

<comment>I'm saying anyone that has been discussed here was not innocent.</comment>

<comment>Your attempt to stereotype notwithstanding...I'm a republican and I am happy to bash abusive government and ridiculous taxes and fines.</comment>

<comment>Find a single Republican presidential candidate who thinks that Ferguson is an example of government abuse. As far as I can see, it's none of them.</comment>

<comment>Has anybody asked them for their views?  Silence does not mean they all see it a particular way</comment>

<comment>Yet, in all the stump speeches, the free time in the debates, and literature and web sites of the candidates, none has said anything.</comment>

<comment>Do presidential candidates only do something when they're "prompted" to do so? I don't recall anybody asking Donald Trump about his opinions the Pope, or immigration, or any of the other things he shoots from the hip about.</comment>

<comment>Hillary and Sanders have said NOTHING about the spotted owl.  So they hate spotted owls and love the loggers and developers that are destroying the forests?  I mean, they both have had ample opportunity to speak up.</comment>

<comment>SQUIRREL !!!</comment>

<comment>Nice try but it's the same thing.  If you can't engage in honest conversation, then you're a waste of time.</comment>

<comment>So when your claim was successfully rebutted, the best you could do was run and change the subject.That isn't honest discussion; it's called changing the subject.</comment>

<comment>No Mr. Fusion, you said that since none of the candidates had said something about Ferguson and abuse that they must not care.  I said that since neither Hillary or Bernie had said something about the spotted owl, then they must not care.  Same thing.  I don't know how you missed that.</comment>

<comment>Nope. We are discussing the Republican leadership not taking any position on the problems of excessive fines to pay for city services. You changed that to an environmental issue that has nothing to do with the topic.If you are going to squirm, learn to do it better.</comment>

<comment>Wow, you must not have followed the course of this conversation.  See Ender's comment above.</comment>

<comment>So you justify your changing the topic by Ender's dismissal of it? Dang, you do have hubris. It's still stupid, but you're trying. And failing.</comment>

<comment>Later Mr. F</comment>

<comment>If you could find large amounts of human suffering attached to the disappearing spotted owl, then I might be worried about their take on the issue.</comment>

<comment>It's not just happening in St. Louis and against blacks. I've been arrested in Hawaii for a 25 dollar parking ticket. I had completely forgotten to pay it and they never sent me a court notice.</comment>

<comment>You stinking racist!  How dare you point out that this is not all about blacks.  </sarc></comment>

<comment>What a great liberal you are</comment>

<comment>Normal liberal.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  As profane as they come.  As if being profane is cool or something.  LOL</comment>

<comment>Yet still better to read than the bigoted crap from the Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Please, go save an inner city</comment>

<comment>Were you jailed?</comment>

<comment>Yep, for about 5 hours before I was bailed.</comment>

<comment>The article dances around proposing a solution. Consolidating courts isn't going to change the fact that you still have to pay a parking ticket and you still can't drive without a license. What the article suggests, but won't come out and say, is that it wants poor people to be exempt from fines. The problem with that is if you have enough money to own a car in a city, it's a reasonable presumption that you have enough money to pay the parking ticket and are responsible enough to get a license.You don't want the nightmare of getting broad-sided by an unlicensed, most-likely uninsured, driver who can't be bothered to attend the court hearing about your accident. There are reasons these laws are in place.</comment>

<comment>And what about saggy-pants, or bins in the wrong place?It is unlawful to imprison someone for not being able to pay a fine, they just don't check if they can pay it. The article also suggests positive things like community service. That would actually help communities rather than hinder them. After all what is the point of laws if they don't serve the wider community.</comment>

<comment>While I agree with community service as a viable alternative, my first reaction is that would be used to replace employed city workers instead of augmenting them. Then it would just be free labor instead.I like the idea, provided it has protections.</comment>

<comment>New Jersey gets a civil judgment against the person, just like a credit card or bank would.  the judgment then follows the person around.</comment>

<comment>Oh yeah that helps!</comment>

<comment>better than jail, tho, right?</comment>

<comment>Sure!  Especially if they're trying to find a job and get hired.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a return to forced unpaid labor.I think black people have a bad history with that concept.</comment>

<comment>I apologize for the off-topic question, but I wanted to ask:If you support community service as an alternative to a fine, do you also support it in lieu of the work requirement for aid (TANF, Food Stamps, etc)?</comment>

<comment>These are people who don't even bother going to court, what makes you think they're going to show up at the park to pick up trash all day? And then what do you do if they don't? Nothing, of course. What do you do on second, third, fourth offense? Nothing, of course.Would you pay any attention to the no parking signs or speed limits if the only penalty after multiple offenses and failures to appear was a mandate to hang out at the local community center on the weekends?</comment>

<comment>If you read the article you would understand that people often don't turn up because they cannot afford the fine and that is an immediate trip to jail, whereas not showing up at least gives you a possibility of not going to jail, this is in stark contrast to not showing up because you cannot be bothered. You also throw in some facts that suggest this is only applicable to multiple offenders which is clearly not the case.It seems you advocate people spending their lives in and out of jail, being unable to hold down even a part time crappy job, and having the lives of their children disrupted because they happen to be poor and once left their bins in the wrong place.</comment>

<comment>What people are advocating is that you follow the same social rules as the rest of us, and if you don't, you're penalized.  If you don't have money, what else can be taken so you learn your lesson?Being poor or black doesn't excuse lawlessness.</comment>

<comment>The bins thing is goofy. The parking tickets, driving without a license and speeding are not. Those are charges that landed the lady in the article in jail. They landed her there because despite having the money to drive around in a car, she didn't pay the $10 parking ticket or the fine for speeding or the fine for driving without a license. And she didn't go to court for any of those.By all means; let's see an example of how you write the law to remove the punishment for those three offenses in such a way that wouldn't apply to everyone and wouldn't prompt everyone to ignore speed limits, parking signs and license requirements.If you're going to own a car instead of riding the bus...</comment>

<comment>The article didn't specify that she owned the car she was driving. Especially since she was 19, it might have been a friend or family member's.</comment>

<comment>The car would be towed each time she was busted. If it was someone else's, they'd probably be getting real tired of that.</comment>

<comment>It's absolutely lawful to imprison someone who has a bench warrant for not paying fines.  Don't confuse one for the other.Where I'm at in California all non-violent, non-felonious crimes are turned over for jail alternative where a person works an 8-hour day at an approved community center or fraternal organization for each day they would otherwise be jailed.Of course, if they don't show up or pay their fines, jail is really the only other alternative.  It's not like they aren't given the chance to make right and do some good otherwise.</comment>

<comment>I thought it was pretty explicit:  allow them to opt for community service for non-violent crimes.</comment>

<comment>If they're not showing up for court, what makes you think they're going to show up for community service?</comment>

<comment>If the government can arrest people for debt on parking tickets can the Chinese arrest our politicians for owing them over 1 trillion bucks?</comment>

<comment>And some people still call this a democracy. What a freakin' joke!</comment>

<comment>Who elected the legislators who write and enforce the ordinances?  In democracy, the goverment is as rotten as the electorate votes it to be.   But i suspect that most of the electorate in these areas are happy to see deadbeats locked up.  Democracy in action.</comment>

<comment>Exactly!  Garbage in; garbage out!!</comment>

<comment>When was the last time legislators asked the public how they felt before passing new ordinances?  We most certainly do not live in a democracy.  We get to choose the least bad of nothing but terrible options to vote into office, then they do as they fancy (which almost always translates to doing what their biggest contributors want, public good be damned).  Calling this society a democracy is just sickening.</comment>

<comment>And what do you think a democracy is?  Everyone magically compelled to enact the common good above their immediate interests?  This is it.   disappointing huh?</comment>

<comment>Yea, yea, if you are black it's everybody else's fault, and it you are white, it's your fault. Deja vu all over again.</comment>

<comment>Another day, another story</comment>

<comment>So you didn't read the article. Gotcha.</comment>

<comment>Did you? Racism and segregation are blamed numerous times, and even in the concluding paragraph.</comment>

<comment>Well it is your fault for your cross bearing twaddle.</comment>

<comment>You deserve creativity points for fault justification, both the cross on my back and my writing style are original. At least it is still my fault, and that is the important point.</comment>

<comment>In southern Utah they have a private prison where they charge the inmates for staying there, it's not enough that you are tossed in there, but now you have to pay to stay!!!! The name of the place?? Purgatory!!!</comment>

<comment>No one, and I do mean NO ONE, should ever be put behind bars for a non-violent crime. Can't we come up with an alternative means of justice? Do we have to consider every infraction a nail, which must be driven in with a hammer? How about using a wrench or a screwdriver (in other words, something other than incarceration) now and then?</comment>

<comment>Agreed but I think the point of the article is that people are being imprisoned for not paying the fines the municipality needs to operate so whatever is done, you either have to find another way to generate that money or reduce  the need for it.</comment>

<comment>No one in this article was put behind bars for a non-violent crime, except one: failure to appear in court.This should go without saying:  if you are ordered to appear in court, it is important for you to do so.  Your kid is sick, you're broke, you are a lazy moron, white supremacy is bumming you out, or you are completely innocent -- tell it to the judge.  Otherwise a bench warrant will be issued for your arrest.No one is incarcerated over a parking ticket or trash cans.  But if you fail to appear in court don't expect a police officer to ask "pretty please with sugar on top follow me because if you aren't too busy a judge would like to have a word with you."  He'll slap the cuffs on you.  </comment>

<comment>I approve of this in theory.  Imprisonment seems like a singularly ineffective incentive, on a societal scale, and in the way we do it just a breeding ground for further criminal behaviors.  My issue is that beyond rhetorical theory I don't have a better idea that would have significant teeth to it, but also not risk massive corruption.</comment>

<comment>So if I scam you out of $10,000 I should just get probabation?</comment>

<comment>not even white collar crime?b-but the 1%, man</comment>

<comment>"I agree"  - Bernie Madoff</comment>

<comment>How easy it is to write a sermon condemning people who don't live like you do; to call their traditions and practices backwards. To stick the "racist" label on them. To pretend to be sticking up for the miserable wretches who this system is treating, as the article says, like we're still in the Jim Crow era. Most African Americans who live in St. Louis / Ferguson have the choice to leave and go live somewhere else... If Ferguson is so racist, why aren't folks exercising that right? Throughout history, from the crusades to the conquistadors, the inquisition and Nazi Germany humans have used moral superiority to justify horrendous things. So I say let's try to avoid using "more moral than thou" arguments, and let's work out the inequalities and inequity in our own backyards before we point fingers at others</comment>

<comment>I think if you read the article, the author made an attempt to excuse the morality of individuals who run the system, saying they are simply continuing a trap that was established long long ago.In fact "peonage", or the taking of a person's liberty for non-payment of debt, has a long history in the South, where you might end up on a chain gang for not having enough cotton to pay the shares owed the landowner.Your point about "cleaning up our own backyard" is well taken.  The point of this piece though, is that Ferguson functions by police collections because the community doesn't have enough to pay enough taxes to run the department.Once poverty is the norm, nobody wants you or your town.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand the issue here.In the first example, a woman actively chose to drive without a license. In the second, the homeless woman did the same thing.Seems like those are personal choices. If you know you can't afford the fine, why commit the crime? You can put tickets on payment plans; They explain it very clearly when you're cited, or call in regards to your court date.</comment>

<comment>Black people are incapable of managing their life events.  It's not their fault.  They are victims.  Or so the liberals would have us believe.</comment>

<comment>Yes, descendants of raped slave children are going to have conditioned reflexes that interfere with their ability to manage life in an oppressive, racist society that targets them with poverty, incarceration, and police brutality. Unfortunately, liberals have adopted the conditioning debts must be repaid, and contribute to the problem by bailing out insolvent bankers while holding the impoverished to a higher standard. Worse, though, are the descendants of the rapists, whose values resemble their ancestors'.</comment>

<comment>My ancestors were raped, driven from the homes and burned at the stake by the Catholic church.  I guess I should get in touch with my inner victim.</comment>

<comment>Why do people keep assuming that blame only belongs in one place?Sure, people need to make sure to follow the laws, but that doesn't mean that the system doesn't need work when peoples lives are overly burdened when they do mess up.</comment>

<comment>I have a friend who is paying $20 a month on $2500 in fines accumulated from drug offenses. Seems like the system is being pretty accommodating for her.Negative sanctions for crime have to be an effective deterrent for criminal activity. Otherwise, why have driver's licenses and traffic laws?</comment>

<comment>If the negative sanctions are too harsh, though, it can cause other issues. </comment>

<comment>I don't see how a fine that can be paid out over the course of decades is unnecessarily harsh.Do you sir/ma'am?</comment>

<comment>Darn. And yet, if they were bank executives and scammed the people out of billions they get bailed out with huge bonuses. Shame on the USA and that portiuon of its populace that has created and continues these attrocities - both ends of the spectrum. Its elected and appointed officials or ANY jurisdiction that does this.</comment>

<comment>My white son spent time in jail for not paying a parking ticket EDIT: then failure to appear in court. While it seemed excessive at the time, it made him recognize that yes it is better to pay the fine. He was poor and did not have the $300 to pay it. But he figured out how to do it pretty quickly. Canceling cable and cell phone for a few months can pay for just about any ticket.</comment>

<comment>You're a terrible parent. And stupid enough to brag about it </comment>

<comment>That goes without saying. Actually when I got the call that he was in jail, I assumed it was for a DUI and let him sit there for a while. He jokes about it now. He will be a 2nd Lieutenant in the Marine Corps in a few weeks so I guess he recovered from my bad parenting.</comment>

<comment>>>  I assumed it was for a DUI and let him sit there for a whileHaha. That's actually good parenting lol</comment>

<comment> His adult son failed to pay a parking ticket and show up for court.  So he was arrested and paid the penalty.How is this bad parenting?   </comment>

<comment>He raised a deadbeat loser. That's bad parenting </comment>

<comment>Chill out.He got a parking ticket.  He never paid it so the cops brought him in on a warrant.Now if he were to blame his arrest on 1940s real estate practices or the Dred Scott decision or white supremacy THEN he'd be a deadbeat loser.   </comment>

<comment>You're making excuses for terrible parenting.  Why don't you believe in personal responsibility? </comment>

<comment>I assumed you were kidding when you said it initially, but after reading your multiple responses I now realize that you must be serious. I don't know if you have raised children. I have six. The 4 adults have all turned out to be productive. A psychologist, a Marine Corps officer, a fashion designer, and a college student. They have all made mistakes, but they are good people. Assuming that because a person makes a mistakes that they had bad parenting is ludicrous.</comment>

<comment>Six?  Now I'm sure you're a negligent parent and shouldn't be giving parenting advice to anyone.  And yes I'm a father </comment>

<comment>Well I am a wretched 2% er on my way to 1% soon. I earned the right to have as many as I want.</comment>

<comment>Cool story, bro </comment>

<comment>Did they feed him? Give him clean water?  Give him any medications he might need?  Did he freeze all night or did they give him a blanket, assuming that he was able to sleep or had room to sleep?Read the ArchCity Defenders lawsuit: these people were jailed under medieval conditions. I was shocked that anything like this could happen in this country.</comment>

<comment>No but it forced him to do something he hadn't done for a very long time. Read a book.</comment>

<comment>I'm shocked that you're shocked.</comment>

<comment>I'm guessing you'll be pilloried for this comment, but thanks for a different perspective.</comment>

<comment>I guarantee you he didn't get jail time for a parking ticket.  He failed to appear in court, a bench warrant was issued, and the next time he encountered law enforcement, he was arrested for failing to appear as ordered for his court date.   </comment>

<comment>You are right, it was for failure to appear. He was getting gas and a cop ran his plates and arrested him.</comment>

<comment>It's a helluva a way to learn that showing up in court should be a personal priority, but now he knows.</comment>

<comment>Yeah he had a habit of putting things off. He is a pretty responsible young man now though.</comment>

<comment>This (the topic and contents of this article) is racism.Pure racism.Racism in its purest form...and it is awful.I voted for Obama twice.I would vote for him again.I am sorry that Scalia died; I am not at all sorry that Scalia is now not a sitting member of the Supreme Court.My kids go to majority black public schools (we are Caucasian and have a choice where we send them).And yes, I work side-by-side with, and have...black friends.BUT...I wish with all my heart that the energy that Coates expends on his Reparations Crusade was instead spent on changing/fixing what is described in this article.All that Coates' reparations articles have accomplished is that they have resulted in fame and fortune for him (in other words, more heat than light as far as solutions that matter are concerned).Friends of mine can't get their heads around the fact that I am left-of-center but against the entire concept of reparations, as described by Coates on this site.Reparations, in the way that Coates describes them...are unattainable...and distract us from what can, with effort and work, be accomplished.The wrongs in this artlcle CAN be fixed...pronto.Let's do it.Fixing this would improve the lives of everyone who lives in the St. Louis area.Let's do it. Let's start now.</comment>

<comment>I voted for Obama twice.I would vote for him again.I am sorry that Scalia died; I am not at all sorry that Scalia is now not a sitting member of the Supreme Court.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If only it were the other way around...</comment>

<comment>Reparations as he describes them are discrimination.The reason he never fleshes out his reparations argument is that he would have to flesh out why it is racist.  He is playing the shell game below:White supremacist one: We should make this country whites only.White supremacist two:  So we should kill all minorities?White supremacist one: Hey hey, you are putting words in my mouth.White supremacist two:  So we gather up and ship out all minorities?White supremacist one: Hey hey, you are putting words in my mouth.White supremacist two:  So then what are you advocating?White supremacist one:  I'm just saying, we should have a discussion on making this country whites only.TNC is white supremacist one.  He wants a goal that can only be achieved through racist and discriminatory means yet he refuses to flesh it out because that would explain how he is racist.It is a stupid shell game and TNC is hurting the black community and making himself a fortune playing that stupid game.</comment>

<comment>Making a fortune?  More like making enemies of those who don't like to hear what he says.Speech doesn't necessarily mean MONEY.You must be thinking like old Scalia- MONEY is speech.</comment>

<comment>it does when you are paid to write it.</comment>

<comment>You actually think TNC is "getting rich" writing?You must not know about these things.</comment>

<comment>Did it occur to you that most St. Louis folks probably want it like this?  Do you really think they want people flouting the traffic laws and not being held to account?</comment>

<comment>The obvious solution is dis-incorporation.  There is no need for 90 small municipalities, all scrambling for money to maintain separate governmental structures, when the county could govern with greater efficiency of scale.</comment>

<comment>The city cannot disincorporate. And I mean that literally. Ferguson is a charter city and Missouri law does not have any way for a charter city to disincorporate. (If the Ferguson charter contained a disincorporation clause, they could, but the charter does not contain such a clause.) It could be annexed by an adjacent city, but that would require that city taking on all the debts and other issues of Ferguson. That is not going to happen any time soon.</comment>

<comment>greater efficiency of scale or just larger scale corruption?</comment>

<comment>Here's an idea. Let's use Guantanamo as a prison for the people who run the credit card companies that charge people 30% interest.</comment>

<comment>Here is an even better idea. How about reading the credit card agreement before signing on the dotted line? How about not going into debt for anything?</comment>

<comment>That's not the issue. The issue is that at 30% interest nobody will ever have the possibility of getting out of debt.</comment>

<comment>No the issue is that you do not have to be in that debt. You have a choice. Do not buy it if you do not have the cash and you will never have to worry about the interest. I was dirt poor for many years. We did without TV, phone, going out, we lived bare bones. It is a choice.</comment>

<comment>True, you should not use credit cards to buy useless garbage but how many people lost their jobs during the "great recession" and had to use credit cards to buy food and clothing for their families?</comment>

<comment>I will grant you that sometimes circumstances can get beyond our control. But most people do not plan for bad times when times are good. Live off of one income even when you do not have to. Save instead of living in the moment. Those future job losses will be much easier.</comment>

<comment>The United States was founded upon Biblical. One of these was the prohibition of usury.  These laws were nixed in my lifetime. There is no reason we could not bring them back.</comment>

<comment>That's also nonsense. People who lend money have the right to earn interest but charging excessive interest is detrimental to both the consumer and the lender.</comment>

<comment>Where does this right come from? I do not see it in the Constitution. Are you making stuff up?</comment>

<comment>Would you rather the option not even be there at all?If a company can't offset it's default risk with high interest, they won't loan. You used the example of people using easy credit to buy food/clothing during the recession. Would you rather those people have starved/died of exposure?</comment>

<comment>So they should not be given a credit line at all is what  you are saying?  Someone getting 30% interest is so high risk that no one would lend to them otherwise.  if they truly needed the money, if it is life or death, then they should be weeping in thanks at the feet of those who loaned them that life saving money, even at 30%.</comment>

<comment>"How about not going into debt for anything."The design of our economy almost requires debt.  Few people have enough pay for major purchases that are needed in the short run.</comment>

<comment>That's not a "better idea," just a really stupid statement.</comment>

<comment>Awww, good on you for being perfect. Some people use credit cards for things like medical bills and hospital visits or vehicle problems.</comment>

<comment>If you're broke then using a credit card is only going to exacerbate the issue.</comment>

<comment>Oops. Replied to wrong person. I apologize.</comment>

<comment>What?</comment>

<comment>Those people are called idiots if they thought the debt would magically work itself out on its own.</comment>

<comment>I was responding to the comment about not going into debt for anything. I presented three legit cases where it happens. I never said that the debt magically works itself out.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you're right. Better people should just die in the streets than offend your sense of white righteousness.</comment>

<comment>Did you catch the part in that agreement where it says they can change this agreement at any time on you, without your subsequent consent? Which works fine if, like the rich folks in this article, you can afford to just pay off that balance and get a different card (assuming you notice the new rules they're making, and understand what they mean, even though they're intentionally written to make that hard.) But if you can't afford to pay that balance, you're SOL, they're changing the terms of the contract you signed on to unilaterally. That's why card companies are always introducing new cards - because they keep making the terms on the old ones worse for their existing customers, and they can't advertise those terms as being competitive any more. </comment>

<comment>So you would rather not have the money, it is not worth 30%.    So explain to me the problem.  Should it not be worth 30% to anyone else ether, even if they think it is?   Is that the problem, that the choice exists?</comment>

<comment>I was born and raised in St. Louis.  Graduated from the Ferguson-Florissant school district,  went away for college and now live in the West County suburbs.There is no such thing as a debtor's prison here or anywhere else in the country.  People aren't imprisoned for parking tickets and trash cans. Judges put people on payment plans, reduce charges, and dismiss charges everyday.  But the people in this article are being imprisoned because they FAIL TO APPEAR in court and a bench warrant is issued.  It doesn't matter if you are a millionaire, white man living in Ladue -- if a warrant is issued you WILL be arrested.It is true that the St. Louis area is more geographically racially divided than other cities.  But it isn't a result of redlining or Dred Scott.  St. Louis and Baltimore are the only major metropolitan cities without a county.  This causes major revenue problems.  It means that people trying to escape the city limits to get their kids out of St. Louis public schools have to move to the county.  (Incidentally the black parents leaving the city for North County are never accused of "black flight". They are simply trying to give their children the best life they can -- and who can blame them).Unfortunately when people flee the city for North county, they bring their pathologies with them: intermittent employment, dysfunctional families, people with criminal records etc.  Predictably three things happen in these communities (Google Spanish Lake -- or better yet drive through it) crime goes up, school performance suffers, property values go down.  And the waltz of a community having problems and  "white flight" spiral downward together.  </comment>

<comment>Honolulu and Washington DC both lack counties. Most cities in Virginia are politically distinct from their counties. I just thought about it thirty seconds to see how mistaken your are.</comment>

<comment>Each Hawaiian island is a county.  The US Congress has "exclusive jurisdiction" over D.C.  The only major metropolitan area in Virginia is Arlington (which is a county). Perhaps you should attempt to think for more than 30 seconds.  </comment>

<comment>Uh, no. Virginia has cities independent of counties. For example, the City of Falls Church is geographically within the borders of Arlington & Fairfax Counties, but operates entirely independently.And Northern Virginia (not just Arlington), is a major metropolitan area, with more than 2 million residents.</comment>

<comment>Look dude, the first rule being pedantic is being right.But you are wrong.  Falls church is not a major metropolitan area. It has a population under 20,000.  St. Louis and Baltimore have 400,000 and 600,000 people respectively.  </comment>

<comment>I don't know how you define major metropolitan area, but:Counties:Arlington: 226,908Fairfax: 1,137,538Prince William: 446,094Loudoun: 363,050Cities:Alexandria: 150,575Fairfax: 24,483Falls Church: 13,601Manassas: 42,081Manassas Park: 15,174That's around 2.5 million people in a 40-mile stretch from DC to Leesburg, Va (the mid-point of Loudoun Co.). These places might technically be classified as suburbs, but they have population densities the rival or exceed St. Louis or Baltimore.The city of Falls Church has a tiny population, but it's sitting in the middle of a county of 1 million + and another county of 200,000 +. It's nothing if not metropolitan.</comment>

<comment>That does not change his point that people are getting themselves in trouble that is avoidable. Failing to appear can be avoided by calling the court house and talking to someone. The judicial system does not want to put people in jail. Silence leaves them with no alternative.</comment>

<comment>I did not say it changed his point. I was just mentioning he was wrong about cities that lack counties. Since he is wrong about that, why should we take anything else he says seriously?</comment>

<comment>You are making it up because federal of department of justice has sited Ferguson for adding predatory fees and fine to fund the police industry therehttps://youtu.be/0UjpmT5noto?t...</comment>

<comment>Georgia is under suit for similar problems stemming from privatizing probation services.</comment>

<comment>These courts aren't just enforcing traffic and parking ordinances, they're also handling domestic violence and assault cases of the Class C misdemeanor variety. Are those defendants also being oppressed if they don't go to class and pay the fine? The fact is this is going on in every municipality in the country. How else are courts supposed to impose remedial measures to discourage irresponsible, anti-social behavior?I know, everyone who requests it gets a full blown indigence hearing, if they are too impoverished they get the fines and fees waived in lieu of community service, right? Forget that it costs money to have people supervised. Should the tax payers foot the bill for all that extra court time and man power?And what about so-called 'dead beat parents', should they too get a free pass?I would concede that violations of the motor vehicle code, especially parking tickets, should result in nothing more serious than impounding or booting the defendant's car (with the exception of DUI) for non-compliance with court orders.The real 'debtor's prison' is limited in scope to private debt. Say you fail to pay your mortgage and continue to ignore notices to appear in court to answer the bank's lawsuit. The court then issues a capias for failure to appear. Once arrested and jailed you get a hearing, and the court releases you with the written promise to return for a monitor hearing. This cycle never ends until the debt and all court costs are paid.The way this scenario should work is if you fail to show up for court, a default judgment and money award is issued in the creditor's favor. They then garnish your bank account and paycheck, and perhaps establish a lien on any property you own. And of course your ability to obtain credit is trashed by this judgment. This way the tax payers aren't footing the bill to help out private enterprise.So please, let's not conflate an obligation to obey the law and support your offspring with an inability to comply with a contract between two private parties.</comment>

<comment>Cash poor state is better off turning selling the debt to collection service. Same person who claims they can't pay a traffic ticket will tell you so while eating a Chipotle meal or drinking a starbuck's coffee. Oh to live in a state where the majority of the population are victims of their self-propagated circumstances.</comment>

<comment>"For Dred Scott, more than a 150 years ago, the cost of returning to St. Louis was his freedom."   What??? Is that how it was?  That is not exactly how I remember the case working out in St. Louis.These magazine authors have a bizarre take on some pretty famous St. Louis history. Dred Scott was there in a safe haven, as a slave, then was aided by sympathetic abolitionist families and lawyers. How that case finally worked out pre civil war is not exactly his being sent back to slavery with the St. Louis court granting his freedom:  "On May 26, 1857, Dred and Harriet Scott appeared in the St. Louis Circuit Court and were formally freed; Judge Alexander Hamilton approved the papers. Dred Scott took a job as a porter at Barnum's Hotel at Second and Walnut streets in St. Louis; he became a sort of celebrity there. The family lived off Carr Street in the city, where Harriet took in laundry, which Scott delivered when he was not working at the hotel. "https://www.sos.mo.gov/archive...</comment>

<comment>How about we have zones with no rules (thereby no fines) and these populations can do whatever the h^ll they want with no consequences. It seems to be the RULES are getting the blame here rather than dysfunctional BEHAVIOR.  Those areas will of course be even WORSE than before, but when the miscreants cross into my town, where civilized behavior is prized,, the rules will be STRICTLY enforced.</comment>

<comment>So did the point of the article make a whistling sound as it went over your head?</comment>

<comment>not at all, it basically blamed the law and not dysfunctional behavior (and the people committing it), for their failure to pay the resultant fines.I'll live where the law prevails, if you prefer to be dysfunctional, you need to live in areas where that is tolerated, and you can vote for politicians that will ensure there are no consequences. I'll vote for politicians that keep my area safe & clean.</comment>

<comment>...keep my area safe & clean.Code for white. Sent by central casting to typify the problem.</comment>

<comment>no, it's code for safe and clean. Most people of all races value that and act accordingly. if you want to live within the law, and value quality of life, all are welcome.If you value the freedom to be dysfunctional, and vote for politicians that won't enforce quality of life ordnances and laws, that is your right. Just live with the results of your choice, don't expect the right to go to a community that believes differently, break their laws, and then demand a pass on the consequences.</comment>

<comment>"This last admonition is of little use for people like Qiana Williams. As a homeless single mother with a young daughter of school age, she was forced to decide whether it was worth risking being caught behind the wheel without a license in order to transport her daughter back and forth from school. Williams insists that she refused to have her daughter suffer the consequences of her homelessness."So Qiana failed to obtain her driver license, failed to pay the ticket and failed to appear in court.Clearly the century and half old Dred Scott decision is responsible for her situation.  Which is why the article starts and ends with it.  </comment>

<comment>There was a lot of important context between the beginning and the end.</comment>

<comment>It makes so much sense to jail someone for their inability to pay a fine....thus making it impossible for them to earn the money needed to pay said fine. Kafka would be impressed....</comment>

<comment>This is happening all over the country to people of every race. Just last week, two of my cousins were arrested for unpaid parking tickets from more than a decade ago in the white, middle-class suburb of Marlton, N.J. One spent the night in jail while the other was bailed.While I appreciate the point that The Atlantic is trying to make, couching this only in the terms of racism is offensive and misses the overall bigger picture that is happening throughout the nation.</comment>

<comment>Did you even read this?</comment>

<comment>Yes. I'm arguing that right off the bat the premise was faulty. Municipalities are doing this to everyone, and not just in St. Louis.</comment>

<comment>Clearly not.</comment>

<comment>Reading comprehension. Get some.</comment>

<comment>Compare this story with how elites (rich banksters) are being treated for their crimes.1.Out of court settlements without admission of guilt on hard core criminal prosecutable offences including murder.2.Postponed, delayed or suspended prosecution. Not followed up even if another offence was committed during the same period of time.3. No mandatory sentencing or even corporate leadership criminal prosecution for money laundering, including involvement with Mexican, Colombian drug mafia or terrorist organizations like ISIL.OK So they were hit with big fines? Not exactly. The amount of fines never exceeded 1-3% of the stolen money or profit advantage AND RICH WERE ALLOWED TO CONDUCT THEIR ROTTEN  BUSINESS IN ORDER TO PAY THEIR FINES even when it would have been directly against  the law and regulations. And to add insult to injury they were allowed to deduct it from taxes.Court should give this woman a job to pay fines if there was equality under the law.This is not about St.Louis, it is classist, statist apartheid by elite against lower classes called selective enforcement of the law on which this "Republic" stands.Reagan became criminal himself when he openly declared that he will not be enforcing labor laws anymore. It was death sentence to already corrupted unions.One may argue that slavery was selectively enforced law based on color of the skin.US is an empire of moral relativism while everybody is looking away being intimidated themselves, drinking hopium of not being targeted by this criminal government.</comment>

<comment>Well stated and fair.How did you learn this?  Why don't others see it?</comment>

<comment>In their headlong rush to make this a discussion about race, the authors leave out the real questions of what economic factors cause municipalities to resort to using fines as a way to generate revenue in the first place.</comment>

<comment>In their headlong rush to make this a discussion about race...You would rather a discussion about sailing in the Caribbean? The authors didn't make the discussion about race, it is about race. And the economic causes are within the article.</comment>

<comment>Is it? I'm not convinced. I'm not convinced the economic woes that cause St. Louis to resort to fines to raise income all racial in their origin? What about Detroit? What about Baltimore?I grew up in NJ and there are cities that are just dysfunctional basket cases of mismanagement, fraud, and incompetence.</comment>

<comment>If you haven't been back to NJ in a while, they still are.</comment>

<comment>It shouldn't be about race.  The race issue is, in this case, incidental.  These particular laws weren't put in place with the purpose of disproportionately impacting racial groups, or even socioeconomic groups (some laws are).  These are more about supporting small-community government architecture, and are applied without consideration of ability to pay.  The municipalities would actually rather that everyone they ticket were able to pay, so they could extract the money.</comment>

<comment>No. It is about race and the bias has been baked into our municipal and state institutions and practices for a long time. Think zoning, privatopias, redlining, federal administration loans and on and on and on.</comment>

<comment>Like I noted in my comment, some laws are intended to cause disproportionate racial impacts.  The laws discussed in this article are not.  That legal racial biases and hardships exist in our legal system doesn't make every socioeconomic/legal issue about race.</comment>

<comment>The Justice department saw a pattern of ENFORCEMENT akin to harassment of one community.</comment>

<comment>I hate throwing this out every time I comment on this issue, but I was born & raised in Ferguson. Obviously I'm white, but I too got caught in this trap as a youth. The point made that this doesn't *necessarily* reflect personal biases is true.I was poor, couldn't pay fines, and scared of being locked-up if I went to court. After a traffic stop I got bounced to 5 munis in a 3 day period just to get new court dates that I couldn't afford to pay fine for anyway. Luckily it was a weekend so I didn't loose my shitty fast-food job at the time.The author is spot-on. The micro-fiefdoms that litter the county are a vicious circle where they require redundant bureaucracies, which require more money to pay for, which land poor people in jail, which require more resources from the fiefdoms... on and on.Consolidating these municipalities is a GIANT step to solving this. Going from 90 courts to maybe 10-20 is just a no-brainer in terms of saving costs, and de-emphasizing police from squeezing the poor for revenue.  But Ladue doesn't want to be associated with Normandy, so good luck.</comment>

<comment>Lots of municipalities funding their budgets or padding the coffers of the private prison industry through these rackets.  Obviously the poor people who are caught up in the system suffer, but so do the rest of us, the tax payers as we also ultimately pay both to lock them up, but also in unemployment, medicaid, their children who follow in footsteps due to mom or dad being locked up for failure to pay, etc.  The societal costs are huge.</comment>

<comment>They have copied it from predatory lenders.  It is predatory means to collect from the poor to fund lifesyles of those that are wealthier than them.100 years ago, Britain was imposing salt tax on the population of its colonized India to fund the life style of wealthier people in England.  It is pretty similar.</comment>

<comment>This is a hugely important piece. Well done.</comment>

<comment>Long overdue. If a low income person gets a ticket...it could end up ruining their whole family. Municipalities that thrive off of traffic stops need to be stopped.</comment>

<comment>So they get to drive without regard to the laws everyone else is compelled to follow?  I don't think so.  If you get behind the wheel, you better be able to pay the fines.  If they can afford cable, if they can afford a data plan, if they can afford cigarettes, if they can afford junk food, they can afford their ticket.</comment>

<comment>Recently a black female Princeton University professor of Black/Urban studies was pulled over by the Princeton police for driving 67 mph in a 45 mph traffic zone.  When the police checked her license, they found that she was driving on a suspended license and had an outstanding warrant for her arrest.  So they handcuffed her and took her to the police station.see story/video here:  http://www.nj.com/mercer/index...She had two unpaid Princeton, NJ parking tickets.  Her driving license had been suspended by the State of Pennsylvania.</comment>

<comment>The officers were very professional in this case. I don't normally side with cops but I feel like she was in the wrong with those tickets, etc. While it wasn't why she was arrested, that stretch of road quickly goes to 35 mph then 25. Her speed was reckless.</comment>

<comment>As long as black citizens insist on voting for Democrats who treat them this way ...they will be treated this way ...and they deserve it.</comment>

<comment>No offense to this article, but can someone tell me ANYWHERE in America you will NOT go to jail for failure to pay tickets, and court ordered fines from local municipalities?</comment>

<comment>There is a difference between giving tickets for breaking the law and drowning citizens in tickets for imaginary offenses such as "saggy pants" for the purposes of collecting taxes.</comment>

<comment>Sure, I agree, but truth is a lot of what poor people do (or can't do) is against the law. Not maintaining your property in decent condition is one, I don't care if your lawnmower broke and you can't afford a new one, you better cut those noxious weeds that are a breeding ground for vermin.</comment>

<comment>New Jersey puts a civil judgment on you rather than send you to jail for unpaid tickets.</comment>

<comment>No it does not, I live in NJ and my girlfriend was arrested and transported to some shore town she had a motor vehicle ticket from to pay it or stay in jail, my mother got an arrest warrant for failure to appear on a broken fence.</comment>

<comment>failure to appear is a different charge, and they do issue warrants for that.  I work in a NJ law firm and see these charges all the time.  driving without a license is a DMV offense and you get a judgment from the DMV on you.</comment>

<comment>Speeding and parking tickets go to the local municipality, if I am not mistaken, and they want their dollars.</comment>

<comment>yes they do want their dollars.  And with all of the corruption in NJ, it depends on whose hand is in your pocket.  Get pulled over on 295 and its the State Troopers.  On Rt 72, could be Lakehurst cops. At least many places seem to realize you can't pay a fine if you're in jail.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a good reason to obey the laws.</comment>

<comment>its almost always a good idea to follow the laws.</comment>

<comment>Not to say Jersey is as bad as St. Louis, that is a MACHINE they are running there.</comment>

<comment>we have our level of corruption and we are used to it, Jersey has been corrupt since the 1600s.  our guys get paid so they try not to get too greedy.  it would be funny if it weren't so sad.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I know. I was talking to this guy once who was a building inspector, and said, did you go to College for that? Nope, Then I guess you must have been a contractor for many years and know construction, Nope He basically BOUGHT his way into the job with his family name and most likely a kickback...scary stuff.</comment>

<comment>Oh wow. Do you live in my township? The former building inspector (an owner of one of the largest construction companies in the state) moved to Florida but came back three years later after he got divorced. What we didn't know is that the guy held the job for the years he was living in Florida, while his "assistant" was doing inspections. He had to resign the job, but then THE VERY NEXT WEEK he got the assistant's position instead...with a higher salary than he was making before. Plus, it made him a pension double-dipper. Great racket if you can swing it.</comment>

<comment>Refusal to pay is different than inability to pay.</comment>

<comment>The way i understand it, is paying a fine is in lieu of going to jail. I have seen defendants in municipal court WANT to go to jail rather then pay a monetary fine, usually it's xx amount of dollars you get credit for each day you serve in jail.</comment>

<comment>And that's called buying your way out of jail, if you can pay in lieu of serving time.As for people choosing confinement over payment, it's probably because payment isn't an option for them, realistically (e.g., $200 may as well be $200,000 to me if I only have $50), or because the rate of credit is higher than their net earning capacity. If I can get credit for, say, $50/day I'm confined, but can only net $40/day by working (after taxes, transportation, child care, etc.), then confinement is the more economic option for me. Plus, while I'm confined, I'm fed and given medical care, whereas my food and medical needs will come out of the $40/day I earn on the outside. If my food and medical care cost $10/day, then, being credited $50/day on the inside, while getting free food and care, is equivalent to getting $60/day credit and having to pay the food and care costs myself. Contrast that with getting $40/day on the outside, and then having to pay the $10/day food and care cost out of that, leaving me with only $30/day to put towards my fine.Obviously, many people have a strong aversion to serving time confined, but if your only goal is to pay off your debt as quickly as possible, under the above restraints, confinement makes more sense.</comment>

<comment>Inability to pay is completely subjective.  If they really want to claim they are unable to pay they should relinquish a month worth of their checking account/debit card activity, lets see what they have been affording.  I am pretty sure you will find a few hundred dollars worth of frivolous waste spending.  Even for Ms EBT-baby-factory-with-the-sob-story-for-every-day-of-the-week herself.Also you should not be allowed a drivers licence or an automobile if you are not able to pay violation fines which are all that ensure you following the law.</comment>

<comment>It's subjective, but only to a point. If I owe a $500 fine, but only have $200, there's nothing subjective about my ability to pay. I literally don't have the money to pay it. Now, if I have, say, $600, then it's more subjective, though I'd still argue I can't afford to pay, since $100 isn't enough to last very long when you're paying for rent and food, never mind anything more than that.A person working 40 hr/wk, getting paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25/hr, makes $1,160/mo, assuming four weeks in a month (slightly higher, if you say there's an average of ~21.7 workdays per month), before taxes. The higher the fine, and/or the lower my savings/earning potential, the less subjective it becomes. If my rent is $500/mo, food is $300/mo, and I owe a $500 fine, I can't cover all of those expenses. And that assumes no utilities (water, gas, electric, heating oil), no transportation costs (and even walking has a cost, both in terms of opportunity cost (e.g., if I spend an hour walking each way to and from work, that's two hours of my day I lose, which I could otherwise spend sleeping, parenting, working a second job, helping my kids with their homework, doing my own homework to further my own education, sitting in a classroom to learn, etc.), as well as wearing out socks and shoes faster, which also have a replacement cost), and that I get my gross paycheck, without any deductions for payroll taxes, which is obviously impossible, because even those who earn little enough to quality as exempt from federal and state income tax withholding still can't avoid paying Social Security and Medicare withholding (FICA). It's 6.2%, which means the most someone can possibly net is $1,160 - ($1,160 * 6.2%) = $1,088.08.Without prepaying any expenses, can you get by on, at most, $1,088.08/mo?Also, many of the extremely poor people affected by this don't even have bank accounts in the first place. They're what's referred to as the un-banked. They can't afford bank accounts, because they have terrible credit, or it's not cost-effective for banks to issue and maintain accounts for people with such low incomes. So, unless they go to the issuing bank to cash their checks (which isn't always possible, depending upon where their employer banks), they pay a fee, just to access their own money they earned. Walmart charges like $3 per check, which is probably the cheapest you'll find. But anyway, how do you propose to audit the non-existent bank statements?And, by taking away the ability of poor people to drive, you're virtually ensuring that they will stay poor. They will either have to take the bus, which isn't even an option in many places, and, when it is, can very very unreliable with its schedule, either resulting in termination for being late, or having to leave extra early to be sure they can catch the earlier bus, limiting their amount of sleep, access to a second job, ability to parent, or ability to take classes; or they'll have to go on foot, assuming they live close enough for that to be reasonable, and which means they'll have a significantly longer commute, which will also affect their ability to hold a second job, sleep, and parent. It's what's known as a vicious cycle.</comment>

<comment>Adrian, be serious for a moment, what is to keep poor people following the law if they are exempt from paying fines?  Scouts honor?</comment>

<comment>Break the law. Pay a fine - or go to jail. Going to jail is the punishment for breaking the law. You don't want to go to jail? Then don't break the law. This really isn't complicated folks. And yes, St. Louis is full of racists - and the vast majority of them are Black.</comment>

<comment>Why I despair for America.</comment>

<comment>There is a difference between giving tickets for breaking the law and drowning citizens in tickets for imaginary offenses such as "saggy pants" for the purposes of collecting taxes.St.Louis is not the only city to use that strategy. In my city of Montréal, cops are fining homeless people over and over again for the most menial infractions in order to extort money from them or throwing them in jail.</comment>

<comment>There is no legally enforceable ordinance against saggy pants. This is sheer hyperbole. The bright line rule is drawn at the line of displaying genitals in public. Some cops don't know the difference between butt crack and butthole.</comment>

<comment>Bingo, couldn't agree more. If you are white and live in one of these communities you will soon learn what racism really means in terms of how you are treated based solely on the color of your skin. Black folks, by far, are the biggest racists in America today.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps a PSA on how to avoid parking illegally would help.</comment>

<comment>Yep. I am totally empathetic to the plight of the poor. They should get as much help as possible in terms of diversion and deference of fines and court costs for minor infractions.But be honest. What we're really discussing here is a large cultural sub-group that is completely apathetic to the basic rules of society. At best.At worst, these people are anarchists who thumb their noses at the law just because they can. So the question is, where do we decide the happy medium is?</comment>

<comment>Community Service, pay them $10/hr to fix potholes until they pay off their fine.</comment>

<comment>Sounds good to me, but i cant wait to hear mr coates story on slave labor.</comment>

<comment>That's why we don't have chain gangs anymore. The cost/benefit ratio is lopsided. Much easier to lock them in small rooms and pay the turnkey minimum wage.</comment>

<comment>Who's going to supervise all those community service workers, the guy who lets five real employees stand around holding shovels while one guy does all the work? That should go over well.</comment>

<comment>You are bullshitting.  Watch the video that posted to see how the system is hacked to create an industry around collecting more and more fee in 100s of dollar for the same violation.If you are avoiding the evidence then you are party to it</comment>

<comment>I am not bullshitting. I am poor and cannot even afford to own a car anymore. I walk or, ride my bike, or the bus everywhere.I don't disagree that the system is focused on anyone that has to drive a car to make a living. I wouldn't call that a 'hack', it's a 'racket.'</comment>

<comment>That is one way of avoiding it but as you said some people need the car to go to work specially in many US cities that lack public transportation.It is racket that is designed to extract more and more funds from the poorest people to fund the municipalities that live off the industry.1000s of dollar for mundane  violation.Watch the video anyways.. you will know what is going on behind the municipal violation industry.</comment>

<comment>I am not watching the video. I am perfectly aware of the problem. Thank you. What you are avoiding is the issue of a certain sub-culture that ignores all laws. This is what most people call 'anarchy', and you refuse to address the issue at all.</comment>

<comment>Obviously you are avoiding evidence and that makes you party to the lynching process</comment>

<comment>Obviously you can't read. And that makes you party to the stupid crowd.</comment>

<comment>Keep posting diatribe.. it is about mounting fees and fine for fee, court costs and hacked violations to boot and had you looked at the video you would have seen that but you are a hack.  What can you do..</comment>

<comment>No perhaps you should also be lynched like this if you like it.  Payment plans with incrementally added up to make people that are your  target as your cash machinehttps://youtu.be/0UjpmT5noto?t...</comment>

<comment>The police force in USA use municipal violation to basically lynch people to fund their lynching industrywatch this DailyShow espisode to see the lynching is done.  It is documentedLynching people with court fines and fees .. $100s upon $100s of dollars  for puny violations https://youtu.be/0UjpmT5noto?t...</comment>

<comment>You are such a blind  ideologue that you use the word "lynch" --repeatedly -- without even a trace of self-awareness.Lynchings were illegal actions imposed by people without proper authority outside the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system.   It was punishment without a day in court to plead one's caseThe people in this article violated the law, chose not to appear before the court and were subsequently arrested after the court issued a warrant.   It is literally the OPPOSITE of a lynching.  </comment>

<comment>Did you watch the video or are just posting canned crap they handed you?.   No it is not illegal to keep charging the poor people over and over for the same violation.  That is how the made lynching legal</comment>

<comment>Are you putting me on?  No one is actually this ill informed, are they?Lynchings were never legal.  They were extra-judicial mob killings.   The entire point of a lynching was to deny someone due process.People that were lynched weren't ticketed, brought before a court, fined, jailed, released and ticketed again.Just stop with the "lynching" rhetoric.  You are making a fool of yourself.  </comment>

<comment>There we go.. the canned posts continue.I ask again, did you watch the video?</comment>

<comment>Are you capable of discerning that my indifference to your daily show clip has nothing to do with your laughable misunderstanding of what a lynching is and isn't?  Now go find a YouTube video of a comedian explaining why failing to appear in court isn't anything like a lynching.   </comment>

<comment>You have not watched it then or you are lying.  The grandmother was in debtor prison because she could not pay the ever increasing fees that they were hoisting on her.Watch it and describe what you saw and then we can be sure that you have actually seen it.</comment>

<comment>How about not breaking the law in the first place. Try that strategy and see how it works.</comment>

<comment>You ever try obtaining and holding a job without a car? Most of the laws and law enforcement policies are focused on who has a car. That's how they track and identify you for everything. Now it's expanded to everyone who has a cell phone.When was the last time you texted while driving?</comment>

<comment>Stop making excuses for people (criminals) who only use your misplaced guilt to serve their own selfish ends.As for texting while driving - I don't. It is dangerous and against the law in my state.</comment>

<comment>Oh, another criminal who routinely breaks traffic laws and gets away with it by demonizing blacks and using the 'misplaced guilt' card. Idiot.</comment>

<comment>That is no response. You are a lousy apologist for someone so dripping in guilt.</comment>

<comment>The Founding Fathers should have outlawed slavery and set a ten year period for returning them to their benevolent motherland.</comment>

<comment>^^This^^There was actually much discussion about doing exactly this among the so-called Founding Fathers, but it was deemed too costly. It would have entailed buying each of them a piece of land and all the implements of husbandry needed to subsist in Africa. We are paying for our cheapness then by being cheap now.</comment>

<comment>From Smithsonian Magazine:  Thomas Jefferson[quote]“One cannot question the genuineness of Jefferson’s liberal dreams,” writes historian David Brion Davis. “He was one of the first statesmen in any part of the world to advocate concrete measures for restricting and eradicating Negro slavery.”But in the 1790s, Davis continues, “the most remarkable thing about Jefferson’s stand on slavery is his immense silence.” And later, Davis finds, Jefferson’s emancipation efforts “virtually ceased.”Somewhere in a short span of years during the 1780s and into the early 1790s, a transformation came over Jefferson.The critical turning point in Jefferson’s thinking may well have come in 1792. As Jefferson was counting up the agricultural profits and losses of his plantation in a letter to President Washington that year, it occurred to him that there was a phenomenon he had perceived at Monticello but never actually measured. He proceeded to calculate it in a barely legible, scribbled note in the middle of a page, enclosed in brackets. What Jefferson set out clearly for the first time was that he was making a 4 percent profit every year on the birth of black children. The enslaved were yielding him a bonanza, a perpetual human dividend at compound interest. Jefferson wrote, “I allow nothing for losses by death, but, on the contrary, shall presently take credit four per cent. per annum, for their increase over and above keeping up their own numbers.” His plantation was producing inexhaustible human assets. The percentage was predictable.[end quote]Read more: http://www.smithsonianmag.com/...Or as Sinclair Lewis wrote a long time later, " "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"</comment>

<comment>The key fact not everyone remembers is that slavery was slowly dying out in the early United States at the time of the signing of the Constitution. And slavery in the 1780s wasn't really that brutal in this country yet, compared to what it would become later. Free and temporarily indentured (to pay for the trip over) white folks worked alongside the slaves in the rice, indigo, and tobacco farms, and raising food to feed the slaves of the truly brutal sugar plantations of the Indies.But in 1793, six years after the Constitution was signed, a Yankee invented the cotton engine, or cotton 'gin. Before that, it would take a person working literally all day to pull all the tiny cotton seeds out of just a couple of pounds of raw cotton. Cotton clothing was not so much cheaper than silk. After that, it was a trivial task. And very soon after the power loom and spinning jenny were invented in England, kicking off the Industrial Revolution.But raising and picking cotton is brutal work, which whites would not do. So King Cotton was born, and with it the vicious slavery that we think of today when we think of slavery. That's why slaves from the northern tier of slave states dreaded being sold "down the river" to the cotton plantations there.So let's give our Founding Fathers a little bit of a break. They thought the problem would take care of itself over time.</comment>

<comment>No the laws are hacks to fund the lynching industry via municipal violationsWatch how the fund the police  via massive fees for the same violation to fund their lynching industryWatch this grand mother being forced 100s of dollar for a minute traffic violation and unable to keep up with ever increasing fees that fund the law enforcement industry living off the feeshttps://youtu.be/0UjpmT5noto?t...</comment>

<comment>Are you claiming that you have never broke the municipal traffic laws ?</comment>

<comment>Nope, but when I did I was smart enough to pay the fine and not get arrested over something so stupid.Why do you support criminals and deadbeats?</comment>

<comment>Only if you had the money and the mountain of the added fees ... so you are hacking it.Watch thishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>It is a tragic story, but shouldn't the grandmother know better than to ignore civil fines for traffic violations?</comment>

<comment>She did not have the money so they added more and more fees and more fine to the fees that she still couldn't pay either.    It is a predatory method to use the municipal violation to extract vastly more money than the cost of violation.What they should have done was to provide monthly payment over two years to pay the original fine so she could pay it.Looking at other cases, one can easily say that it is a predatory lynching industry</comment>

<comment>If we're gonna have debtors prisons, we may as well have serving time actually clear the debts.  $50 credit per hour towards your fines that the person spends locked up.Do the crime, do the time.  Pay a $500 fine or spend 10 hours in jail...  then be on your way free and clear.The problem is, these perverse systems lock people up for inability to pay, then charge them additional court and incarceration fees that they ALSO can't pay...  and it spirals from there in a hamster wheel of poverty and powerlessness.Such a system would make it very clear which of these minor offenses are really worth jailing someone over.  As a city you want to incarcerate someone over chipped paint?...  great...  but that is on THE CITY'S dime.  Collectively, you pay for the prison.  Government is for and by the people....  but if societally we want to get bent out of shape about minor nonsense, WE have to pay for it and not pile it onto the most powerless amongst us.\Suddenly, I think a lot of these govt-run racketeering schemes would quietly disappear.</comment>

<comment>Most sensible post I've seen yet, thank you.I am an old white guy who is retired and lives on less than $12,000 a year on Social Security benefits. I can't afford to own a vehicle anymore, but that's only because the cops caught me driving without insurance and I had to decide what was more important - my freedom or the convenience of driving.I quickly decided it was better to walk, or take the bus, to do my grocery shopping and other errands rather than risk going to jail. In one of the ongoing reset hearings the judge plainly told me to either pay, or 'keep a low profile' until I could get the money to pay the fine. He knew I couldn't afford it, but he was at least being honest with me.The only way I avoided getting arrested and jailed was by not driving. This isn't an option for many people who need to commute to a job. The larger issue here is that so much of law enforcement's efforts are focused on the automobile because, it's simply the easiest way to extract dollars from the general populace.</comment>

<comment>It appears to be that the issue is personality responsibility, not the fines.  If I understand the article, Ms. Williams's troubles started at the age of nineteen when she was arrested for operating a motor vehicle without a valid license.  Rather than appearing in court and asking for a payment plan, she declined to appear in court.  By failing to appear, a bench warrant was issued for her arrest.  So she made two mistakes:  driving without a license and failing to appear in court after being caught for driving without said license.Since she is now thirty-seven with a ten year-old daughter, she had almost eight years to resolve her issues with law enforcement and the courts before she incurred the responsibilities (and high costs) of parenthood.  Surely she could have worked out a payment plan if she would have appeared in court after her first ticket was issued as the courts rather collect revenue than jail people.  She could have gotten a driver's license once the fines were behind her.  And put this all behind her so that she need not break the law to take care of her daughter.Instead she continues to try to dodge her court summons, incurring more fines and more arrest warrants.   Of course, that way ends in personal ruin.The State has a valid interest in insuring that drivers are properly licensed and insured, and that people who fail to meet those requirements are encouraged to meet them.  Once again, personal responsibility.</comment>

<comment>So what's one more ruined life to you anyway?Don't you understand the PD is taking advantage of the very people it is charged to protect and serve?Yeesh.  The one example given and you are sure its all the citizens's fault.Are you a cop in Fergieville?</comment>

<comment>I would hope you are being sarcastic, but I fear you are not.The State did not ruin her life; her initial choice to drive without a license started the whole process.  She made the choice to do, not the police who are charged with enforcing the law.  She also made the choice not to appear before the court, not the court.  And every court will issue a bench warrant for failure to appear.Law is essential to a functioning society, and the rule of law requires means to help steer people back on course.  But a person has to help herself.</comment>

<comment>Well said.It also begs the question as to what laws would Ms. Williams be "ok" with other people choosing not to follow?No doubt she would like people to follow the laws she considers important and would be quite upset if others behaved as she did and randomly decided to personally opt-out of following laws they did not like.</comment>

<comment>Ya.  What do you care anyway?She's nothing to you.</comment>

<comment>Except of course I already expressed my objection to her treatment.Putting additional fines on poor people that can't afford the original fines is unlikely to help.But what do YOU care about being accurate about what people actually say? ;)</comment>

<comment>[quote] "It also begs the question what laws would Ms. Williams be "ok" with other people not following?"hrumph.You don't give a damn about her.  You kick her while she's down.</comment>

<comment>Ok so no good reason to argue then.You will read stuff into the post that is not there and refuse to read what is.Boring me now.</comment>

<comment>".....what laws would Ms. Williams be "ok" with other people not following?"Don't tell me you are kind or even sympathetic.  You insult her anonymously.</comment>

<comment>ONE EXAMPLE should not cause you to assume the pattern of predatory fines and fundraising on the backs of the Black Community are all the fault of those who fall into the trap.But you quickly use ONE EXAMPLE to say what?"It's all their fault!!!"You may notice, without judging the woman harshly, that this is a systemic problem identified by a Civil Rights investigation by the Federal Department of Justice, with evidence and testimony and a court-ordered summary judgement to stop this PD from continuing its bad practices.</comment>

<comment>But that is the whole example used to frame the article.  The author chose the example, not me.  I also am not judging Ms. Williams as she admitted she started the whole process by driving without a license and failing to appear.  If that had not happened, none of her other legal issues would have occurred.</comment>

<comment>Ya.  You are right.  She deserves her poverty and her fines for driving without a license.There it is."Black folks bring all of it on themselves."Except this is a pattern of abuse by institutions that goes back to the founding of this country.  The article falls right after PBS aired  Slavery By Another Name,  that documented slavery up to WWI by using peonage", the right a White person had to imprison a Black person until they had worked off their debts.</comment>

<comment>Of course, she deserves her fines for driving without a license.  That is what the law, passed by our elected representatives, states.  We get the laws we deserve as we elect -- or fail to do so (based on turnout for local and state elections) -- lawmakers to reflect our wants and needs.  Every state has the same law, so I suspect that the vast majority of people must value licensing drivers.Poverty, of course, no one deserves.I find it troubling that the logic used is essentially, "Her outcome is bad, so it must be someone else's fault".  Does she bear no responsibility for her present straits?  Or can both the State and she bear some responsibility, her for the initial conduct and the State for creating a cycle that she cannot escape?And it is safe to say that if she never drove without a license, she would have far fewer legal issues?</comment>

<comment>After she has been duly punished with fines and maybe jail time, or if she gets some money and skips Missouri altogether...Then will Ferguson be a nice place for poor African Americans?Maybe.  Or maybe the police department will be taken over by the Sheriff who doesn't want it and who needs more money to patrol it.Ya, let Ms Williams suffer for her mistakes.  Nothing for us to do for her anyway.</comment>

<comment>Since you seem to have identified an issue, what resolution should the State provide to make Ms. Williams whole?  And what laws should be changed to insure what happened to Ms. Williams does not happen in the future?It is not enough to complain about the issue; being part of the solution is proposing and championing a solution.  So what do you suggest?</comment>

<comment>The article is not about Ms Williams.  She was used as an example of how a mistake can ruin you financially and how that outcome supports the cost of policing Ferguson.If they tried this in most WHITE towns. the cops would be driven out so fast it would make your head spin.But this population has no power to stop the exploitation.  It is SYSTEMIC</comment>

<comment>Actually the exact thing happens in many towns, small and large.  Cities in NJ and towns in GA are famous for this.http://www.governing.com/topic...</comment>

<comment>The White towns I am familiar with allow all kinds of strangers to be picked up out on the highway, but as soon as a local gets tagged for no seatbelt or some kids of important people get harassed, the cop goes down the road and we get another one.</comment>

<comment>And no suggestions on how to fix the issue.  Hmm.</comment>

<comment>Actually, the Justice Department gave them a list of things to do as part of a summary judgement.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the DOJ report has a list of possible fixes.  However, none of them would compel a police officer to not issue a ticket (summons) for driving without a license or a deny a court the power to issue a bench warrant for failure to appear.  There are some good policies on handling the court issues, which is positive.  The ideas around explaining the options in dealing with the courts are very good.But one still gets a ticket for driving without a license and a bench warrant for failure to appear.  No way around that.</comment>

<comment>I think they disbanded the PD.  Whether patrolling will change or not I guess I have no idea.These problems have roots back 200 years plus.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>You extrapolate a judicial finding of patterns and practices in the Ferguson PD that are unlawful, predatory and are ordered to be fixed by summary judgment.Maybe you would consent to a new opinion if only she didn't confirm your hunch that it is a failure of those folks to obey they law that is costing them so much.</comment>

<comment>Wide spread and rampant abuse of the "fine" system.Personal responsibility is crucial. But additional fines on poor people who could not afford to pay the original fine is unlikely to help.On the other hand people randomly deciding to opt-out of laws that they found inconvenient is a recipe for chaos.No doubt Ms. Williams would be outraged if other people randomly decided not to follow laws she deemed important to her.</comment>

<comment>Except you said it was all her fault.Do you acknowledge the institutional predation?</comment>

<comment>Well 1st--please present to me where I said it "was all her fault."Then 2nd, you really need to read the posts your are objecting to.Read the first 2 sentences of my post above.  I already objected to this kind of abuse on poor people that could not pay.So yes, I already, quite specifically "acknowledge" the problem.Which you would know if you actually took the time to read prior to knee-jerking your objections.I have little issue with having an argument--clearly. But would it kill you to actually have a valid reason to argue?If you don't I'm simply going to say "boring me now" and move on.</comment>

<comment>I'm just disgusted with the abuse of African American people living in America TODAY.Don't make a mistake or it will destroy your life.</comment>

<comment>Read the whole article. Not one comment that almost all of N. St. Louis and all those cities are democratically run. Been that way for decades. So once again liberals whine and cry and sob about things they created.</comment>

<comment>Read the whole article.It is made clear those who administer the system are not morally complicit, in that the system is a trap for them too.But your point about blaming democrats means you remain superior- in your own mind anyway.  I thought you told us cops and soldiers were all Republicans?</comment>

<comment>I read the whole article. Those in charge are not complicit. Come on. Get real. We are superior. Nobody ever told you cops and soldiers were all Republicans. They are controlled by the Mayor and city administrations and they are all Dims (okay, Ferguson had a none political election to select their mayor).Once again the liberals accept no responsibility at all. They were made to do it. Innocent victims. All those Dim Urban Ghetto Plantations you run, from Baltimore through Detroit, why its not your fault. Nope. Let me guess. Just off the top of my head. Reagan did it.</comment>

<comment>Not a bad point. Who elected the folks running St. Louis?</comment>

<comment>Well, I live in the opposite end of MO so I had to look it up. On Wiki you get "The Democratic Party has dominated St. Louis city politics for decades. "Now understand that St. Louis is like a dot on a map. There is the city, the county, and the burbs which extend well outside of the county.</comment>

<comment>Yeah it can get complex, but I would love to know the voting habits of the people hardest hit by these abusive fines. Which IMO they often are.If the people hardest hit have been voting in and not voting out the very people doing it to them.Or not voting at all.Nobody, but NOBODY deserves to be a victim. But elections do have consequences.</comment>

<comment>This is the NewyorkTimes article that shows how they lynch residents of pagedale Missioner with fines.. it include unmatched curtains.. If I had not read it, I would not believe it.  Lynching the poor to fund the policing prison  industry is the name of the game""Yet in recent years, some here say, warning notices have begun appearing on house after house. In 2013, the city generated 17 percent of its $2  million in revenue from all fines and fees, documents show, though Mr. Alton said the portion was lower now. According to an article in The St. Louis Post-Dispatch  that first described the rise in non traffic cases in the region’s  municipalities, Pagedale officials issued 495 percent more tickets and  citations unrelated to traffic in the years since 2010. City officials  dispute that claim, saying the increase was smaller."" http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11...</comment>

<comment>Pagedale must be run by greedy Republicans.http://www.cityofpagedale.com/...</comment>

<comment>Cities are not run by republicans or democrats so you are ranting.  That municipality is one of the 90 municipalities in St, Louis Missouri  that are structured to collect fees and flood the courts to pay the police forces foisted on them with massive costs.""There are 90 municipalities in St. Louis County, and more in the surrounding counties. All but a few have their own police force, mayor, city manager and town council, and 81 have their own municipal court. To put that into perspective, consider Jackson County, Mo., which surrounds Kansas City. It is geographically larger than St. Louis County and has about two-thirds the population. Yet Jackson County has just 19 municipalities, and just 15 municipal courts — less than a quarter of municipalities and courts in St. Louis County.Some of the towns in St. Louis County can derive 40 percent or more of their annual revenue from the petty fines and fees collected by their municipal courts. A majority of these fines are for traffic offenses, but they can also include fines for fare-hopping on MetroLink (St. Louis’s light rail system), loud music and other noise ordinance violations, zoning violations for uncut grass or unkempt property, violations of occupancy permit restrictions, trespassing, wearing “saggy pants,” business license violations and vague infractions such as “disturbing the peace” or “affray” that give police officers a great deal of discretion to look for other violations. In a white paper released last month (PDF), the ArchCity Defenders found a large group of people outside the courthouse in Bel-Ridge who had been fined for not subscribing to the town’s only approved garbage collection service. They hadn’t been fined for having trash on their property, only for not paying for the only legal method the town had designated for disposing of trash""https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Are you offended by me pointing out how these Dems are running this cities?</comment>

<comment>just be quiet and absorb the reality youve been served</comment>

<comment>I've noticed Democrats don't take responsibly for the mess they make.</comment>

<comment>Obviously you are not able to debate the facts and that is why you are flipping your ID and posting diatribe RepublicanDon</comment>

<comment>We see how black students of racist Missouri University handled their racist problems.  Blacks Missouri citizens can do the same thing, if the football and basketball teams stand with them to get rid of the racist laws.When you look at the racist universities pulling in hundreds of millions of dollars from football games, not counting basketball, I believe it will have  lawmakers who put these racist laws in place, running around wondering how quickly they can can the laws.Blacks have power they don't realize they have in sports played by black athletes they are causing white universities and white  colleges to bring in unbelievable money for them.  These racist are in complete denial, using racism to have revenue to run their cities and not employing blacks except for a very few not repersentative of the football team, or the black population.One day soon and not later this will become a reality.  We look to the youth, like at Missouri State black youth stepping up to deal with racism against them.</comment>

<comment>With all the tools in place to get money from people - bank levies, garnishment, property seizure - putting people with debt in prison just seems grotesque. Also - how the eff are they supposed to pay said debt if they're in prison?</comment>

<comment>It's a last resort when offenders do not have a bank account, job, or property. Not everyone is wealthy and privileged like you.</comment>

<comment>So, the appropriate response to a desperately poor, disenfranchised person coming into a parking ticket is to ruin their lives by putting them in the system? Man, I knew we were f*cked as a nation, but I had no idea how badly. We should all be ashamed of ourselves.</comment>

<comment>Well, there's always forced labor. It doesn't have to be fines or imprisonment. What's your idea for restitution, hotshot?</comment>

<comment>A national income; a social safety net; free, universal healthcare; non-commodified laws that emphasize community service over monetary punishment, since fines greatly favor those with means over the poor. You realize that incarcerating these individuals costs us about $50k a year, right? Guess what - if you just gave that $50k to them up front they'd never go to jail, never be in the system, and would probably be considerably better contributors to both our economy and our society. In fact, they'd be stable households with a sense of security, food on the table, and a reason to invest in civic life.Like I said: punitive and ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Only government can toss you in jail for not paying your bills.</comment>

<comment>We should all take note. Local governments across America have given themselves the authority to take money from people at unequal rates. The amount of money any government should be allowed to collect in fees and fines must be strictly limited, and should always be far less than they need for regular operations.The root problem here, not talked about in the article, is St. Louis area government's insatiable appetite for funds. That area, like so many broke cities that have been run by big government Democrats for decades, has huge unfunded pension obligations to government employees.It's the same story as Flint but playing out in a different way. Big government Democrats run a city for decades, rack up enormous bills paying out extraordinary pensions, and then in the mess created by a giant revenue shortfall, the most vulnerable suffer.</comment>

<comment>And the most vulnerable are often the "little people" the Democrats claim they are there to help.</comment>

<comment>Democrats cause the problems?  Is this what you really believe?</comment>

<comment>What difference does it make to you?No matter what I say you are going to simply ignore what I actually said, and take offense at something I did not say.Already been down that route with you TODAY alone.I clearly do not object to argument, I do request that you have an real objection to argue about however.Watch I bet you are going to prove me right and introduce a bunch of Strawman stuff about things I did not say.Boring me now.</comment>

<comment>Sorry.  I object to insensitivity toward the shabby treatment of Americans whose skin is brown and whose lives have been so difficult because a few people think they should be controlled and kept in abject poverty without jobs, homes or decent futures.I know Republicans think Michael Brown "had it coming".I think Michael Brown was murdered and Ferguson's history is shameful.</comment>

<comment>I don't have prescribing rights. But that'd be  awesome (singsongy).</comment>

<comment>The malignant giant got what he deserved, a full magazine.</comment>

<comment>The evidence suggests that Michael Brown was shot in self defense and got what he had coming.  And that Ferguson's history is shameful.</comment>

<comment>Michael Brown was not murdered.  End of story.</comment>

<comment>Yes, with all my heart and soul. Unfortunately, the GOP is only marginally better. </comment>

<comment>Who runs these areas?</comment>

<comment>The Federal Government takes money from at unequal rates.</comment>

<comment>Look, municipalities are either going to have to tax the law abiding citizens more, or continue to stick it to the riff raff that can't manage to live by the rules. Only the federal government can print money - not cities, counties and states.</comment>

<comment>Or learn to grow their economies instead of destroying them.</comment>

<comment>In NYS they take away your license if you don't *file* your taxes.

<comment>If you are going to use Dred Scott as context for the current situation in St. Louis, shouldn't you mention that "Following the ruling, the Chaffees deeded the Scott family to Taylor Blow, who manumitted them on May 26, 1857. Scott worked as a porter in a St. Louis hotel. His freedom was short-lived. He died from tuberculosis in September 1858.  Scott was survived by his wife and his two daughters."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...And shouldn't further context be given, such as the fact that Archbishop Joseph E. Ritter desegrgated Catholic schools in St. Louis in 1946.  In fact, "On Sunday, September 21, 1947, church pastors throughout the archdiocese read a letter from Ritter to their parish congregations informing the opponents of multi-racial schools that any civil lawsuits would result in automatic excommunication."http://archstl.org/node/430172...</comment>

<comment>Nothing wrong with a debtors prison.  If you can not pay your just debts off you go to a facility where you will live in minimal conditions (so your incarceration is not a bourdon  upon the those not in prison) for the full time of your sentence.  The first occupants of the prison would be the President, all of Congress and the heads of government agencies.  Those positions would be re-staffed by personnel elected in special elections.</comment>

<comment>I was young in the early 1970s, hitchhiking from southern California to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.  I got a ride from a man in a pick-up truck who was driving east into Saint Louis one night.  I told him I was tired of hitchhiking & asked if he could drop me at or near a bus station.  He told me the nearest bus station was in East Saint Louis & that he refused to be responsible for a young white man's death.  I thought he sounded racist.  He drove me further east to another bus station.  Now retired, I try to be tolerant of young people's naivety.</comment>
