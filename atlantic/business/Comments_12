<comment>This is an extremely important area of inquiry for explaining the roots of housing segregation and showing that there's more to class immobility than prima facie income inequality. Unfortunately, there's a counter-narrative already in place that goes something like: "These mortgages are contracts entered into freely. Minority homeowners have only themselves and their deficient culture to blame for their lack of financial acumen. If they don't want bad rates all they have to do is shop around and drive a hard bargain." Dismantling that line of attack requires dispelling the simplistic view that all financial arrangements are 100% voluntary choices made by ideal actors with full knowledge, a good bargaining position, and etc., and substituting in the much more complex reality in which economic advancement requires a lot of bullet-biting and risk-taking, and in which lenders, aware of the mass desperation of impoverished minorities, exploit and predate on people trying to improve their lot in life and their children's prospects. The social and financial landscape between poverty and the middle class is riddled with tiny obstacles like these that are often more substantial and numerous for minorities than for whites, and the difficulty of pulling it all together to paint a cohesive picture of just how difficult it is for minorities to improve their station is among the most substantial ideological challenges for minority and poverty activism today. Here's hoping this piece can contribute to that effort.</comment>

<comment>Even the article admits that minorities don't shop around. Not my problem if they can't stop partying long enough to get a good loan.</comment>

<comment>I think he/she phrased it more harshly than needs to be. I'd say that it's more like having your heart broken as an adolescent. You are just not quite prepared for it at 15-16.</comment>

<comment>SARCASM--DID NOT GET IT DID YOU---</comment>

<comment>That appears to be the entire issue. Of course that simple fact can't be stretched into an entire article..........This is the same point that the "star" of The Big Short movie made; that there may have been many greedy bastards mixed in the stew but if the prospective homeowners did not apply and obtain a mortgage that he/she could clearly not possibly afford, the meltdown would not have happened.</comment>

<comment>Why should blacks and Latinos have a greater burden as consumers to ensure they aren't getting screwed over by unethical business deals? Isn't that what the infrastructure of the state is for? When those Toyotas were recalled because of faulty brakes, did you blame the people who died in them for not doing their due diligence in buying a car? Do Bernie Madoff's victims have only themselves to blame?</comment>

<comment>What on earth does a bad product have to do with a lifetime of bad decisions? Now were saying that one group in this country is swindled through life? Do you really think African American's are that stupid as to not be able to think for themselves?</comment>

<comment>What on Earth does getting a bad mortgage have to do with a lifetime of bad decisions? Did you even read the article? Let me guess, you skimmed? The study controlled for credit score and still came to the same conclusion. Actually State the Obvious' analogy was a good one. You try to do the right thing by purchasing a home, or buying a reliable foreign car and then you realize due to some forces beyond your control that you made a grievous mistake. You should be careful Sparta because your inherent bias is showing.</comment>

<comment>You veered off track on this one. The point is people are not forced to buy a particular mortgage product. They should have declined the bad rate and moved on to another vendor.</comment>

<comment>A piece of advice: Make sure when you explain the point to someone that you actually get the point. No one us this country is "forced" to buy anything they choose to spend their money on. The study's findings indicated that when controlling for other factors such as credit score and income, minorities still came up short on mortgage rates. Because traditional lenders don't seek out there business.  They don't market their products in communities of color, therefore they do not exist in the realm of possibilities to minorities seeking to obtain a mortgage.  High rate lenders, however, do reach out.  You cannot deny the influence that marketing and advertising have on people's buying decisions. You can't Mark, so don't try. You'll just make yourself look more foolish than you already have. As the study indicated, high interest lenders avidly target low-income/minorities. They are undeniably predatory....and influential. I'm feeling like you didn't read the article either. </comment>

<comment>WITH THE EASE THE NET BRINGS HARD TO THINK ANY COULD SCREW UP SO BADLY ON A MORTGAGE---THERE ARE TOO MANY GOOD CHOICES WHEN YOU HAVE GOOD CREDIT AND DOWN PAYMENT ENOUGH----MOST LIKELY THE REASON THEY DID NOT SHOP AROUND WAS THEY "WERE TOO BUSY TOO" SINCE FEW MAY HAVE EVER BEEN EDUCATED AS TO HOW 1% POINT MAKES SUCH A BIG DEAL----</comment>

<comment>NO YOU MOST LIKELY YOU HAVE THOSE THAT PREVIOUSLY QUALIFIED FOR PAYDAY LOANS ONLY ---AND YES YOU SHOULD LOOK UNDER THE HOOD SINCE MANY OF THOSE TOYOTA ISSUES WERE NOT REAL--YOU CAN ONLY GO ON PAST HISTORY WHICH TOYOTA HAD A GREAT ONE---AS FAR AS MADOFF YES HAD ANY REALLY CHECKED INTO HIS DEALINGS THEY WOULD RUN--IT SEEMED COMMON KNOWLEDGE MADOFF'S DEAL DID NOT ADD UP ---</comment>

<comment>You're accidentally picking up on something that just drives the actual reality-based community nuts. Rather than searching for a way to blame someone over a problem, most people just want to find a solution to it. What's the solution to this problem? Based on the examples in the article they are:Educating people about the need and the tremendous financial incentive to shop around for mortgages when buying a home. Educating people about the importance of maintaining a good credit score and how to do it. Educating people about budgeting.I'm all in favor of this. I'd be in favor of spending money to do this. It won't happen because you and too many others are stuck wallowing in the idea that ignorance is a by-product of racism rather than a natural state for people of all races that can only be rectified with information and the willingness to listen to it. Fix it, don't cry about it.</comment>

<comment>I tend to just commentate instead of offering solutions because my solutions are too radical for most. I think that it is immoral to allocate necessities like housing using a system as mired in historical injustices as capitalism. I would prefer a mixed economy in which necessities are guaranteed by the state and the free market is restricted to luxuries. But addressing the freeloader objection is such a muddy, contentious and repetitive argument that I get tired of it. In my neo-Marxist view, the root of the problem is not the ignorance or financial ineptitude of the people taking out loans, but the fact that our society tolerates as exploitative an arrangement as requiring a long-term debt to major financial institutions in order to get housing. That's counter to the ideals of independence and social mobility. Because capital is so highly concentrated in the financial and business sectors banks and lenders get to serve as the gatekeepers of homeownership. No matter how skilled in the art of mortgage negotiation you may be, the fact is the party with the money is the party with the power and from start to finish they will dictate the terms. But I am aware that most people are not inclined towards my view, so I generally just hint at it a little and then move to the next article.</comment>

<comment>I'm trying to think of a list of countries with nationalized housing on any large scale, things don't seem to be going your way.Odd too that I was well into my thirties and had lived in some really nice places without being required to enter into long term debt with a financial institution for housing. When I finally did, it was my choice, I shopped around, and eight years later I sold having made more than the bank ever did on the deal. You can enter into housing contracts as short as 24 hours and as long as 30 years in this country. That's why you can fit all the "neo-Marxists" in this country into one WalMart.</comment>

<comment>Good honest explanation. I don't agree with most of it, but I commend you for it.</comment>

<comment>I think this is pretty positive and valid. I'm not sure how much I'd pay, though. Maybe make it a part of HS curriculum, but then you can't be sure they wouldn't cut class, huh?Maybe a sort of mandatory class for 1st time buyers, funded by the realtor (or seller, if a private sale). Like those classes for first-time parents, but mandatory.Of course, as a private seller, I might be tempted to ask for more money, to cover my increased cost to to a first time buyer, or perhaps not to sell to a first time buyer, at all.Law of Unintended Consequences, huh?</comment>

<comment>Every time articles like this come up, I wonder why no one's every tried to sue these companies under the Civil Rights Act. If people who had identical profiles except for race were getting different lending rates, that's pretty clearly against the law, isn't it? It would be difficult, but if you were successful you'd be a hero.</comment>

<comment>Fix it, don't cry about it.I share your point of view, and I'll take it one step further.If it is indeed true that blacks are constantly ripped off by mortgage companies, why doesn't an African-American (or a consortia of African-Americans) start a mortgage company that caters to black customers, providing them with low-rate, low-cost loans?According to all these studies and articles, there is a ready-made market just waiting for someone to step in.  </comment>

<comment>You could ask the same question about:Rental houses and apartmentspayday loan placescorner convenience storesneighborhood restaurantscar dealershipsIn each instance we're told a vulnerable people are looted by greedy people who charge far far more than their services are worth in order to get a crazy profit margin. Which mean, in each instance, a small investment would net someone a wonderful profit margin and would still be priced much less than the competition. Somehow, that never seems to occur to anyone.</comment>

<comment>I am white. I went through school in honors classes, but dropped out. I needed to work. No college for me. It's when America first started to fail, the early 70's. In 1981, I got screwed on my first mortgage.(I was taught nothing about these most critical of financial transactions in high school, not in the regular required curriculum). It was during the end of Carter's term. Inflation was high. Interest rates were climbing. My feeling was, get something now, the interest rates will never come down again.  I got stuck at 13.5 %, they eventually went over 20%. When the interest rates finally came down, my credit was shot, I had missed some payments. Several mortgage companies told me " Sorry, IT WAS BUNDLED, they couldn't refinance it".  The mortgage had been sold, and resold several times. The real estate agent took me to this mortgage company......... So I gave up, I would quit making payments, to finance my business, then catch back up, when I could. (There is a whole larger story about how I eventually got myself out of this mess, too long here.) It was survival.....So back in 1981, mortgage instruments were  just the same as in the 2000's that is being blamed on the period of deregulation in the 90's....... This all so confusing. In about 2005, I bought a house for $40,000, no money down, payment way less than normal rent. ( At closing, they had stuck with a thing called mortgage insurance, an extra $60 a month. I didn't understand what it was for, but I said okay. So I let my self get screwed again. My credit was over 800. )This was the real estate companies in house mortgage writer. And they were trying to sell me a house for $175,000 because I was qualified. While all you educated folk out there scratching your heads about why things are the way they are..............This is not this stupid Illuminati conspiracy junk.... This is what is wrong.......The Federal Reserve is a company, a corporation created(Chartered) by an act of Congress in 1913, banks owned by banks. They gradually weakened the rules that were originally inserted to fool Congress into accepting this crap. They were originally supposed to bail America out, not vice-a-versa... We need stronger laws to regulate corporations. I understand this because I use the same tricks for my assets. I start corporations, and put nothing in my personal name. It is cheap and easy. .......I am not college educated, it doesn't mean I am stupid, I am self-educated, learned it by living it, how to get around the system....How in the world are most people in this society supposed to understand what is happening to them when they buy a house..... There should be a REAL credit counseling services, by the government. This shit has to stop. It's not because people are dumb. It's not because people are too stupid or lazy to shop around.It doesn't matter your ethnicity. The system is rigged to fool you. These smart people who run this country don't understand, if they don't care, I don't know. Bernie Sanders may not have the correct solutions, but he is true blue and real, like no politician I've seen. And I don't care if he loses, I am going to be comfortable that I voted for someone who is real and will not bend no matter what. ....Feel the Bern!.......If not, it's Trump or nothing.</comment>

<comment>"no money down,"That was why you paid mortgage insurance. At 20% down you don't have to.</comment>

<comment>wrongbeing preyed upon is part and parcel of the struggle from any position of weakness. The difficulty is supposed to be compoundedyour mindset only works if you assume the same ideal scenario you describe to be standard. That kind of thinking is why some minorities don't get ahead - they're too busy waiting for fairness</comment>

<comment>It is my intention to create fairness in this world. I will it. There are many like you who believe unshakably that nature is red in tooth and claw. Perhaps it will be necessary to deal with such people on those terms. Once that business is complete the remainder of us will proceed to enjoy civilized society. If you have no regard for others, and expect none in return, I hope at least you will not be surprised when your end is a bloody one.</comment>

<comment>"Once that business is complete the remainder of us will proceed to enjoy civilized society."I hope you'll have enough company to form up a co-ed softball league.</comment>

<comment>Harsh, but essentially accurate.At a certain point in my life, I realized that, as you put it:"being preyed upon is part and parcel of the struggle from any position of weakness.This is intrinsic to human--indeed, animal--exisitence, no avoiding it, and so the actual answer was to struggle from positions of relative strength....and this is entirely possible if you pick and choose your struggles until you reach a point where in most of the struggles, you'll be in the position of relative strength.So: run like hell from situations wherein you can see that you are in the position of relative weakness, and try hard to engage in positions of relative strength.And right there, the last clause, is where it begins to get ugly, because when you do these, you try to portray that the positions are reversed--they have at least an equal hand, when in fact you basically have the angles covered.I'm still not entirely happy with this part, but the linkage to successful outcomes is, to me, very clear, and if you like success, then...</comment>

<comment>You realize, of course, that the counter narrative, which is essentially a lengthy re-phrasing of caveat emptor, and the "dismantling explanation" (which boils down to to the admission that strangers in business seek to gain advantage over each other by any means possible) are not mutually exclusive, right?I mean, the difference between being robbed in the street and giving one's property to Scientology is that there are laws against the former, but not the latter, and that's what goes on in normal transactions.  If the practice used against you is illegal, you have a chance at recourse, otherwise, you'll have to content yourself with sniveling about it.No one is saying it's not hard for minorities; what they're saying is to be careful not to make it harder for yourself than needs to be. Be wary, be skeptical.Be wily...</comment>

<comment>My solutions for improving this: class-action lawsuit (I have no idea if the NAACP or any organization is working on something like this, but they should be) and longer-term, a return to community-oriented banks and mortgage lenders. Clealy, blacks and Latinos have even less of a reason to trust the big banks than the rest of us. These are both long-term solutions, though.</comment>

<comment>Nice article, old news that dates back before the 50's and 60's ...interesting use for the word institutional........example......growing up in Chicago your value, education,  wealth and success was already pre-determined  from the zip code you lived in  and or whatever personal bias that person held against your skin color......and I can have this conversation with any 'formally educated person' on this site and for SALSA STEAK'S comment listed just below my response ?...you are right,  now would you care to discuss it as well as your current status of living......I would like to hear your overall opinion as it relates to minorities</comment>

<comment>Okay, sure. I'm a graduate student doing engineering research and living on a stipend. It pays the rent but not a lot more. My parents grew up poor farm kids but got good middle-class jobs, partly through military service, and are now solidly upper-middle class. I don't really know how to explain the view of minorities that I have. I live in Georgia so the two most common minorities I get exposed to outside of the university are poor blacks in low-end service jobs and poor Latinos in landscaping and construction. I've seen the poor neighborhoods and the south side ghettos, trailer parks, section 8, crumbling brick schools in the city, and sagging trailer-schools in the country. I've seen how a lot of people live and it always just looked kind of obvious to me that when you start the race from fifty meters behind the line you're going to be behind for a long time. I guess what gets to me most is the smug, superior attitude whites around here still have. There's so much dog-whistling, feigned pity, and "well they're perfectly nice people but I wouldn't want one of them dating my daughter" it's sickening. It all seems like so much self-aggrandizing baloney. Blacks in particular were wronged for a long time, in a very big way, and the shame that that threatens to bring down on the South collectively is so huge that people do masterful mental acrobatics to avoid it. The best way, of course, is to find ways that it's all their fault and to constantly ask why, after they've had a good two or three generations where they were *relatively* unoppressed, they haven't caught up yet? You would think a region as Christian as this would have a touch more of the "judge not lest" going around, but no, judging blacks is pretty much the state pastime. The hardest part of my view is that I have to concede that personal choices do play a part in all this. I just don't think there's any grounds to point that out before the playing field is actually level. Blacks, Latinos, and people of every minority make mistakes, plenty of them, but the difference is that when a white person makes a mistake it's *just* a mistake and they get plenty of chances to recover, but when a minority makes a mistake it's proof positive of their degenerate culture (very popular dog whistle) and shows that we never should have given them a chance in the first place. It's a double standard and the absolute refusal to recognize it is impressive in its scale and solidity. There's a certain order to things around here and once you've had a good long look at it you begin to see how it is held together and by what interests. Like I said above, it's hard to paint the full picture, but if you keep your eyes open around here it's striking how many tiny ways there are to stack the deck. I don't think minorities get a fair shot and that is, in my opinion, un-American.</comment>

<comment>Thanks,  I appreciate your response and hopefully you will continue to be guided by the collective insight, understanding and experiences you have gathered, and share it along the way as you move along the path of life.....I ask that you take the time and do a Google search / look up on Msgt Charles Hull....you should find 3 links on the page, or go to the top of that page and click on 'images'......an abbreviated story of my life can be found there......I am also one of those who started the race from fifty meters behind the line......today my life is solid in whatever class I desire, at 73, my health is better than most, and 'smug, superior attitude, people avoid me ..Your dad knows the deal......ALSO...the WH occupant, et al:could have done a lot more to improve race relationships, and the image of Blacks than he did......'a whole nother story' .and opinion I will be more than happy to share with those not educated beyond their intelligence........keep in touch</comment>

<comment>This is a fairly credulous article that relies on a study, but shows us none of the methodology, only the finding, and expects us, I suppose, the just take their word for it.For example:"By looking at the different variables that factor into mortgage type and mortgage rates, the researchers find that race alone accounted for nearly all of the disparity in high-cost mortgage lending between whites and minorities."We see nothing here beyond an assertion.I'd be a bit more trusting if, for example, they could show us that for online mortgages, when there is no real face-to-face encounter when estimating and offering terms, there exists a substantial difference when all other financial factors are equal, AND the market in which the house in located is viable, not stagnant or declining.Look, real estate is my baby. If you want a good residential loan, have 20% down, a 790 credit score, let the house be located in a market that has increased by 2-5% for 10 years, and let your P&I and tax/insurance = not more than 33% of your unattached monthly income.Please show me that blacks/hispanics with these financial credentials are systematically treated otherwise. I'll believe it if you can back it up.</comment>

<comment>the PDF linked to in the report went to a more complete copy, which had citations and sources</comment>

<comment>The abstract sumamrized the phenomenon like this [emphasis mine]:"The increased incidence of high cost mortgages is attributable to both sorting across lenders (60-65 percent) and differential treatment of equally qualified borrowers by lenders (35-40 percent).  The vast majority of the racial and ethnic differences across lender can be explained by a single measure of the lender’s foreclosure risk and most of the within-lender differences are concentrated at high-risk lenders.  Thus, differential exposure to high-risk lenders combined with the differential treatment by these lenders explains almost all of the racial and ethnic differences in high cost mortgage borrowing."this says that racial/ethnic differences can be explained by foreclosure risk, plus an overlay of differential treatment (we still don't know what that is, exactly, and have to pay $5 to find out) "explains almost all of the racial and ethnic differences in high cost mortgage borrowing."The authors say that most of the difference is not accounted for by racial/ethnic differences, but by risk factors for the lender.However, the author concludes, boldly, that [emphasis mine]:"By looking at the different variables that factor into mortgage type and mortgage rates, the researchers find that race alone accounted for nearly all of the disparity in high-cost mortgage lending between whites and minorities."[EDIT: I re-read this; I can't believe it: she has it completely ass-backwards from what the researchers found, and yet she is including their study in support of her contention that "race alone...". She even goes so far as to say that this is what the researchers found.Wow. What's up with that?]She must have access to the full study, huh?</comment>

You get a house, they get paid a loan.When you go to Nevada, remember that the slot machines are not all paying back the same percentage.  The ones in the airport pay the worst.  The ones just off the strip tend to pay the most.  Even in identical machines.  The transaction is "mutually beneficial."  However, the player isn't getting the best deal at the airport.  Is that "screwing them over?"  {Notice the lack of any standard as to what that means?}</comment>

<comment>"'screwing them over?'  {Notice the lack of any standard as to what that means?"Screwing somebody over is acting in bad faith by withholding information that would in all likelihood nix the transaction."Unlike a banker, a barber is actually a professional"Notice the lack of any standard as to what "professional" means?</comment>

To quote from the paper:“We include geographic controls for the percent of households in poverty, the percent of residences that are owner occupied, racial and ethnic composition and the mean rent to value ratio, all within the census tract where the borrower will reside upon closing. Percent poverty is included as a general proxy for a disadvantaged neighborhood, while rent to value ratio is used as a measure of perceived equity risk and is scaled to capture the ratio of the present value of all future rents at the current rental rates to current value so that higher values are associated with lower expected rates of price appreciation.”</comment>

<comment>Look, real estate is my baby. AHHG, I take it that the sentence above means that you are in the business?If so, tell us in your experience how most people find a mortgage.  Doesn't the Realtor often steer homebuyers to a particular mortgage company or broker, someone they work with often?</comment>

<comment>To clarify: I buy/hold/speculate/develop multiple unit residential properties. I've bought quite a few small pieces that qualify under Fanny Mae-type conventional loan requirements, so I've seen it from that side, too.I think what you say is certainly  valid, but there's no real reason why a buyer wouldn't find the loan independently. I don't think I ever bought any property where I didn't find the money independently, and for the most part, I *believe* that the majority of buyers does it his way, but I suspect that what you say could be true for the majority of 1st time buyers. And this could well be the case for minority buyers. But, again, I don't know how many of these might qualify for FHA loans, in which case the realtor might direct them to that sort of lender.But beyond that, I don't mean to be harsh, but the buyer needs to be aware of what can be done on his/her own behalf, in his/her own interest. There really isn't any way around the fact that in an adult transaction, you need to know what you're doing.</comment>

<comment>... but the buyer needs to be aware of what can be done on his/her own behalf, in his/her own interest. I agree ... and as you say, I suspect that many first-time buyers or other inexperienced buyers simply go with the mortgage company or broker that has been referred to them.They aren't shopping around and they aren't going to a major bank for a mortgage.Edit:  I found this article that says that 77 of homebuyers only apply to one broker or mortgage company.http://www.consumerfinance.gov...</comment>

<comment>Thanks! Interesting!This adds to the communal knowledge base we have going here.</comment>

<comment>I was one of them but I also had been tracking rates for several months and knew theirs were in the right ball park. I saw no need to do more paperwork and to add a bunch of inquiries to my credit report.</comment>

<comment>If you take a (legal) drug that has undisclosed side effects, or has been tampered with before you bought it, you can get compensation. If you drive a car that didn't meet safety standards you can sue and win. You can sue for damages if you spill hot coffee on yourself. But the banking industry, the one with the biggest effect of people's lives, unto generations, it's caveat emptor?</comment>

<comment>There are some regulations in place as limitations, checks.There is one devil of a lot of disclosure, and getting more each year, it seems. But yeah, it's caveat emptor for most transactions, with illegal practices being outside the implied requirement to take individual precautions.But now that you mention it, what, exactly, could we expect a bank to cover as a transaction proceeds? You mention drug companies, in what sense is this like a bank loan? I mean, the details of the loan are spelled out in several ways--details in the actual note, several federal forms done in plain English during the process, and if they don't adhere to their explicit promises, you can ramrod them from behind in court, while the gallery looks on, admiringly.E.g., most loans allow for no pre-payment penalty after a certain amount of time--many have no such time limit, and if you retired the loan 2 months after you started payment, there's no penalty. If they charge you, you can screw them, and they know it.And the other side of the equation affects *you*, the borrower. You tell them you'll pay and when and how much. If you don't do this, they can eventually screw you, as well. Nor can they demand anything beyond this, unless it is a highly idiosyncratic loan, between the seller and buyer (rather like the equivalent of a payday loan) and the borrower was uninformed enough--or self-destructive enough--to sign it.I mean, we can't really expect a bank to guarantee that you'll be able to keep your job for the duration of the loan, or that your home will increase in value. In fact, in that case, if a bank refuses to lend--exercising social responsibility on behalf of the loan applicant to not lend on a home that looks like it will *lose* value--if those applicants are to a disadvantaged minority, you know what will happen, don't you? The bank will be criticized for not lending to a minority for a home that they have identified, and that they want to buy and are looking for a loan with which to purchase it. There are also likely to be prosecuted, as well.So, to inoculate itself against that, the banks essentially make the loan, but to protect themselves financially they may require a larger down payment, and a higher interest rate.I mean, anyone can see what would happen if you loaned a stranger 100% of the price for a Nissan Sentra, they paid for 6 months out of a 60 month contract, and you had to take it back. Right? You can see that the car will have depreciated n, they will have paid less than n, and what will you, the lender, do? You can sell the car for but you'll lose money on the deal. In fact, you'll have to *hire* someone to sell it for you, unless you want to close the lending office while you take prospective drivers on a test drive..So, you ask for some combination of a) a down payment; and/or b) a higher interest rate, to cover the chance that the borrower will not pay you enough to cover the depreciation.The same can also apply to housing--not usually, but possible. The federal government's quasi-public lender Fanny Mae has decided that 20% down is a sort of "standard" and that this will cover the lender's risk in the event that the borrower defaults in some fashion.</comment>

<comment>enjoyed your bailout, bankster?</comment>

<comment>I am not now, nor have I ever been, a card-carrying member of a bank...</comment>

<comment>You don't marry the first women to give you sex. You don't buy the red sports car and you don't purchase a house with borderline credit.  Psssst, white folks do the same thing !  I know, it's crazy.</comment>

<comment>It's probably not a fix for someone with an especially ethnic sounding name but I just bought a house through a lender 100% online.  I never met this guy face to face so he had 0 way of determining my race other than guesses based on my name.  This might help take the edge off at least because then the first relevant thing the banker really finds out about you is your credit score and not how you look.</comment>

<comment>A great credit score, consistent employer longevity, a solid, consistent income level, at least a 20% down payment, and even a history of home-ownership is the key to the lowest interest rates available. Do we really need to relive the housing bubble of 2008 again. No more Clinton's "everybody needs a house" mantra. </comment>

<comment>If everyone doesn't need a house, you're advocating either for mass homelessness or a renting class. The former is obviously bad so I'll assume the latter. Having a renting class is bad. It funnels money continuously from the poor to the land-holders. Land ownership is primarily hereditary and is stained with historical injustices. Maintaining a renter-landlord relationship for a prolonged period of time is a system commonly known as serfdom, and is also generally regarded as bad. Thomas Jefferson's ideal of a nation of independent agrarian land-holders is best translated into a modern context as a vision of a nation in which it is feasible for every citizen to achieve financial independence, which necessarily entails owning your own home. It's a more robust economy and more just.</comment>

<comment>It would be awesome if eveyone could buy. Your idea is great in theory, but there are/were way too many foreclosures. People have to be disciplined in their spending habits and job stability for a while to avoid their high risk status. No more 2008 again. Taxpayers bailed out that mess. And the undisciplined poor had a wasted gift.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I do think the housing collapse was a pretty good example of a combination of institutional, policy, and mass personal failure, that's why I don't at all prefer the neoliberal approach. In a state socialist approach we would at least have been left holding all the bad assets (read: homes) and could have left the people in them. With our neoliberal tactics people lost their homes, the taxpayers lost their money, and the banks walked away with everything.</comment>

<comment>Lots of corruption with bankers and the repeal of Glass-Steagall, but who's going to pick up the tab each month when the home-owners can't. That's the taxpayer again. Unfortunately, many of these people buy more than they can afford and lose their job.</comment>

<comment>Um... I rented for awhile, then, once I got enough money, I bought my own place. Are you saying that I should've received my place for free?</comment>

<comment>Ideally, yeah. It's great that you were able to save up enough money to buy your own place, but the implication that that means that everyone could do so with just a little financial discipline does not follow. The way I see it, rent is a tax on the poor for not being descended from historically wealthy demographics. You got away without paying too much of that tax, but for people with thinner margins, it can last a lot longer, and many are never able to buy their own home. To me, that's systemic exploitation. I don't expect any agreement on the issue, though. Nobody wants to think about the full implications of land ownership because it's a much happier picture to imagine that the mechanisms of a free market economy will sort all these problems without any active effort needed.</comment>

<comment>> The way I see it, rent is a tax on the poor for not being descended from historically wealthy demographics. You got away without paying too much of that tax, but for people with thinner margins, it can last a lot longer, and many are never able to buy their own home.Here is a workaround: Military service. As a part of veteran benefits, military personnel, as well as veterans, can buy real estate with both 0 downpayment and very low percentage on the loans.</comment>

<comment>And if you'd bother to do some homework on what caused the housing bubble, you'd know that it had nothing to do with telling people they need a house. Please go read up on derivatives and credit default swaps. Or if that's too much work, just go watch The Big Short.</comment>

<comment>I know the history well. There are many evolving details. But it was Clinton who started it with that stmt and his repeal of GS. Others were involved as well.</comment>

<comment>People didn't run out any buy homes they couldn't afford because of something Clinton said. And most people dreamed of buying a home long before Clinton showed up. The problem is the banks and the lenders made it way too easy to buy a home. That's where I do blame Clinton. Not for telling people to buy a home, but for deregulation that removed all the safeguards to prevent buyers from getting in over their heads. I just bought my first home a few years ago after saving for years. Despite the stricter lending standards, I'm still amazed at how much money they were willing to lend me. The right-wingers blame buyers for not being smart enough to know that they were borrowing too much. But I blame the banking system for knowing that it was lending too much to people who couldn't afford it and then betting that those buyers wouldn't be able to pay.</comment>

<comment>Yes I agree. That's why I usually  deal with Southest Financial Credit. They have sick rates. The Wells Fargos of the world are looking for ways to deceive and take advantage of certain bad credit risks. I have a great credit rating and the difference in their rate and SE Fin. was pretty big for no reason. Capital One Venture credit card is great also.There should be laws that don't allow people to take on more debt than reasonable. And banks should be fined for preying on the poor.</comment>

<comment>Yes because to not relive it is of course racist</comment>

<comment>The even greater injustice is the Mortgage Interest Tax Deduction, from which lower income families receive no benefit.  The interest on the mortgage can be more than the principal.  As a result, poor people end up paying for their homes plus they subsidize the homes of the rich.  It's time to end this monstrous injustice of social engineering, which also creates the 30 year mortgage and its impossible-to-value derivatives that were at the heart of the financial meltdown.</comment>

<comment>While I agree that the home mortgage interest deduction is unfair, let's not pretend that "poor people" subsidize it.  Poor people generally don't pay income tax, so they aren't subsidizing any tax expenditures.  Middle class people subsidize tax expenditures.</comment>

<comment>Good point - it should be a tax credit.  Then it would actually help the people who need it.</comment>

<comment>Because they don't pay taxes </comment>

<comment>What are the data on default rates by ethnicity?  Didn't a lot of studies find higher black and latino default rates, when controlled for credit score, even in lower-cost mortgage products?  It may the case that individual factors typically used to predict credit worthiness are simply not as accurate for blacks or latinos, or they over predict black and latino creditworthiness.  If that's the case, raising the bar slightly for blacks and latinos would make sense.</comment>

<comment>So basically black and Hispanic borrowers are failing to do their homework, just like in school, and as a result are making stupid and uninformed choices.</comment>

<comment>Yes and it's racist!</comment>

<comment>How is it racist to point out when people are being stupid?</comment>

<comment>So the answer is, in part, as per the article,  is that certain groups don't shop around and take the first offer the get?So part of the solution is simply to ask questions and not take the first thing offered.I would also be curious to see the default rates comparatively. Might be helpful. Maybe.</comment>

<comment>Only one color greenRidiculous article </comment>

<comment>Ignoring that "minority" seems to mean just blacks and latinos, it sounds more like they found a correlation and not a causationyou could at least expound on why these folks might be attracted to high risk lenders or vice versaor do you just leave the question hanging so ppl can assume racism? cuz that'd be a very american thing to do</comment>

<comment>It means just blacks</comment>

<comment>Um, Ms. White, there's this online company called "Quicken," where anyone - black, brown or  otherwise, can get a mortgage.The main reason black people struggle to get credit is that their net worth is 1/16th the white average and their per capita income is some 20% lower.</comment>

<comment>We don't need these formalities, Ms. White ... here take what you need!</comment>

<comment>Financial "red lining"</comment>

<comment>Could it....could it....could it just be that blacks and hispanics are more likely to foreclose, all else being equal?  Its the culture thing.  White liberals, having successfully eliminated race and culture as a factor to explain deferent behaviors, is twisting itself in knots trying to explain all kind of behavior related issues.</comment>

<comment>Over 70% of children in the black community (even higher in Hispanic)  are born to single mothers (absent fathers) There's been a total dissolution of the family unit, influenced by the welfare state.

<comment>Do real estate and Donald Trump ring a bell?He said "I love the poorly educated." It is not difficult to put two and two together to find out who is hurting them.</comment>

<comment>60-65% of the difference is "lender sorting," meaning the minorities don't shop around and are stuck with a higher rate mortgage than they could qualify for.  It seems that the subprime lenders know that minorities are less likely to comparison shop so they target these groups.   A mortgage is the most complex transaction most people will ever encounter, so some government protections would be reasonable in this case.The other 30-35% of the difference is bigotry within individual lenders.  You would think that the higher-ups at these lenders would try to quash this bigotry because it is eroding profits; bigotry for no economic reason is bad for business.</comment>

<comment>Wow!!  I love it when overindulged white people with a prep school sweater and spiritual angst start to 'solve' the injustices rendered upon the downtrodden.  Thanks for your sympathy and Marxist solutions, but you'll never find justice.  Just us.  (apologies to Richard Pryor)As long as you continue to reinforce the mantra that minorities - in every sense of the word - are victims, we'll never achieve equality.  The more you attempt to assign blame my misfortune and poor choices on the scandalous behavior upon others, the less inclined I am to accept accountability.  If I'm not accountable, I will forever be a victim.I, for one, believe black lives DO matter.  And now would be a good time for a million men to march right home and prove it to their children!  Stop being a victim!  Take responsibility! The government and all its obedient trust fund advocates will never give you equality!  You got to earn it, dammit!</comment>

<comment>"Why Blacks and Hispanics Have Such Expensive Mortgages"Because they're unreliable and tend to either destroy thier property or get it caught up in illegal wrangling?I'm just guessing.But one thing is probably true,that its not just for no reason just to pick on you.If they're gonna pick on anybody its hard working honkeys to offset losses.</comment>

<comment>So... long story short, blacks and hispanics need to get better at comparison shopping.Maybe force integrate them into Asian neighborhoods so they can learn how to haggle better?</comment>

<comment>I've purchased 4 houses and never met the person giving the loan, nor do I remember ever checking a box regarding race.  Who does that anymore? Its all online, and they give you a handy table comparing rates if you go to any of the online services...and the rates each company uses are determined by an algorithm of your credit score, past history, and fundamentals of the purchase (applied to whoever is giving them the money). Its illegal for them to factor in race.If you don't do the basic comparison shopping, yes, you might get shafted, and get stuck with unnecessary fees or higher rates.</comment>

<comment>Prob for the same reason some of the rest of us who have little, no or poor credit.</comment>

<comment>Put down the credit cards and make a consistent effort to pay down debt. Live in a cheaper city, if possible. We've been here before: the 1970s. Most of the baby boomers who graduated college in the mid-1970s faced a rotten job market, stagnant wages, and then sky high interest rates. I worked and saved, more tortoise than hare, like most of my friends. The entire poor economic picture then meant not many people were buying or selling, which ended up good for renters and rent with option to buy creatives. By the time the economy turned a decade later, a lot of us had a decent down payment on a nice starter home. But nearly everyone I know also delayed having kids till they were financially secure and done sowing wild oats. The baby boom among my friends didn't happen till everyone had rehabbed/renovated that older home @ age 30 or even 35.</comment>

<comment>Gillian, can you please stop writing such garbage...Do you really need an extrapolation on how bad decisions lead to bad results?</comment>

<comment>I don't buy it.....I think this article is complete BS.  If I don't see numbers, I call BS.</comment>

<comment>"High-cost lenders are much more aggressive in minority markets"Very true.Another thing - what I notice is part of the problem is that everyone wants a house, no one likes renting, and so there's a small renters' market.I don't watch Suze Orman, but one day I was scanning through the channels for something interesting and landed on PBS, where Suze Orman was taking questions from the audience.  She was explaining to one woman that the propaganda telling people that it's always better to buy than to rent was wrong.  A lot of times buying is a very very bad idea, and it's much better to rent.  Then she explained the criteria required for buying, what actually goes into buying and keeping a house (not just paying the mortgage), etc.  People don't get to hear that.  They see other people buying homes, they want one, and there's no one to explain reality to them.  So people who have no business at all buying a house, end up with a house.  That's where they end up getting a horrible loan, land in bankruptcy, losing the home, in serious financial trouble, and often homeless.The other thing I notice is that families don't want to unite to buy a home.  There's nothing wrong with family members getting together and buying a home together.  You split the costs, and you all have ownership.  You can sell it and split the money later.  But nope.  Everyone wants the isolation and secrecy that is so popular here, so they end up in a home buying situation they should not have been in, in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Have you ever owned a house with anyone not your spouse, or lets say a vacation cabin? Nightmare comes to mind. As Sartre said Hell is Other People...</comment>

<comment>Arigato.</comment>

<comment>Having counseled many employees on the value of homeownership simply pointing to race doesn't address the issues.   Rates are available in this era within a very narrow band of less than .05%.   Bigger factors are income, debt and your credit score.  In particular the credit score, a automated process detached from individual traits, now commands what and how much.  750? Your in.  Below 600. Forget it.     Homeowner ship is tightly tied to family income.  Blacks and working class white folks lag behind hence sub prime mortgages.  Remember how that worked out?</comment>

<comment>So The Atlantic wants US to believe that blacks and Hispanics are somehow incapable of reading legal contracts and acting accordingly? Negotiate for better terms if you are unhappy with what is offered - it is the American way.</comment>

<comment>Blacks and Hispanics should also learn to vote once in a while.</comment>

<comment>Yes, there is an essay in the Atlantic every day like this one.</comment>

<comment>because the banksters were given money instead of being executed. That is why they have higher mortgages</comment>

<comment>More dishonest shell games from White.  The ever increasing population drives home costs, but White has chosen, despite misgivings, to swallow the neoliberal propaganda on immigration.  You can also 'build wealth' by saving money, but that requires a living wage, which again, low-wage immigration and illegal immigration undermine.And of course, I mean of course, White ignores Asians once again.  The role of real estate in the Asian community is huge.  Just pick up a Chinese newspaper on the West Coast and you see all the realty companies catering to wealthy Asians and encouraging real-estate investments.  In other words, Asians like me are, admittedly, part of the problem.  I own an apartment complex, which I try to rent at fair rates, but rent has doubled in the last ten years.</comment>

<comment>What kind of job do you have, that allows you to buy an Apartment Complex?</comment>

<comment>Depending on size, location and willingness to leverage buying an apartment complex is actually pretty doable on a professional salary. It's not nearly as much money as people seem to think it is (what small business is?).</comment>

<comment>I am thinking at the very least a 100k a unit, for low end stuff, I guess a 'small' complex is 8-10 units, so that's a million right there, plus your regular home mortgage.</comment>

<comment>Ideally the apartment is building is profitable, so it's an income stream rather than a cost "plus your regular mortgage". Of course, making sure that is the case is part of why owning an apartment complex is so stressful.</comment>

<comment>Civil engineer.</comment>

<comment>How big is this complex, do you live there? How did you get such a big loan? Civil Engineers make like 80-100k on average</comment>

<comment>Yes, obviously I got a loan.  My parents were lower middle-class immigrants (not money). I suppose I made enough to qualify and as a licensed professional seemed like a good bet.  I also bought it in 2009 at the market nadir.There are 12 units.  I did in fact live in one for a time.  It's just one of those random walk-up apartment complexes in residential areas; it's not like I own a sky scraper.</comment>

<comment>We know your polite, but what do you actually do :P</comment>

<comment>I helped a family member find a rental house in my suburb a few years ago. Every single landlord we encountered was Asian (in my area, it is mostly people from China).Most of the Asians I know own at least one rental house.  Asians dominate real estate here.  They have their own agencies, their own brokers, their own banks.</comment>

<comment>Two key factors that help some people become more financially secure, wherever they land on the economic ladder and whether they rent or buy a home: learning to save and manage cash flow as a child or teen. Building wealth is a practical set of skills, not pure freakin' magic that everyone is born with. Chances are if someone's parents were frugal savers, the kids will be, bettering their chances at saving enough for a good downpayment and delaying procreation till they have in hand a college degree and first good job. Not doing that is the hard way, the HOV lane to financial instability and fewer options throughout life, with offspring inheriting those limitations and fiscal voids.</comment>

<comment>The Author fails to recognize that the Housing Crisis effected all homeowners. They all got screwed. This also occurred internationally. The Senate held hearings. The Congressional Black Caucus, led by Senator Elijah Cummings was very firm that prosecution would occur.  No one went to jail. In Ireland 23 Banksters went to jail. All people that suffered harm were repaid. In the US the Banksters were rewarded. Is the Author positive that the the Black leadership in the Senate did their job to protect victims. I do not think so. She may even be a participant trying to cover her tracks.</comment>

<comment>"members of these minority groups are less likely to comparison shop for mortgage products, which in turn increases the chances that they’ll wind up with the first offer they receive, and those offers tend to be expensive ones."As a former agent I can tell you for a FACT the biggest reason for the sky high rates is that members of these minority groups more often than not end up moving forward with a broker that is of their SAME RACE and the brokers (who are the ones coming up with the higher quotes -which lead to HIGHER COMMISSIONS) are taking advantage of the blind trust. I have witnessed 1st hand the high-fives and laughter and "laying them away" after a trusting "minority" member leaves the office after meeting with his broker of the same race - the blind trust is the reason they do not shop around. I have even seen clients revisit the broker after being quoted a lower rate elsewhere only to be convinced by the trusted member of their SAME race that it was some type of scam and that they wold end up getting screwed if they were to move forward with the loan at a better rate. RACE was certainly a factor in closing these deals and blind trust to members of their own race was the reason the majority of these folks were ultimately sold the short end of the stick. These continual articles trying to imply somehow the industry has a secret agenda to rake minorities over the coals are laughable to those who have actually been involved in the industry. Considering the legal protections against such policies and actions IF there were ANY factual basis to these claims, the legal leaches AKA lawyers would be running ads non-stop and the courts would be flooded with class-action lawsuits - but that is NOT the case now is it!!???</comment>

<comment>Actually it is. There have been several large lenders busted for predatory lending requiring them to pay big fines. The most notable being Wells Fargo, a company that was built on it's good reputation.</comment>

<comment>Predatory lending has NOTHING to do with race. Members off ALL races have been victims of predatory lending - start with looking up the definition, and move your way up to researching some documented news stories on the topic and get back to me - I've worked in the industry and witnessed what I stated 1st hand - thanks for the chirp.</comment>

<comment>Indubitably, I find it rather pleasant being white. Cheerio!</comment>

<comment>Why not try to help blacks and Hispanics learn how to comparison shop? The article itself states that this is a major cause of the disparate outcomes.</comment>

<comment>Hi, Hispanic homebuyer here.  I got a pretty good deal--a reasonable interest rate and normal closing costs for the price of my house.  Maybe it's because my mortgage agent was a friend of mine (who is white!) or maybe it's because my wife and I have professional degrees, great credit (I paid off student loans 14 years early and a couple of car notes early), and had saved enough to put at least 20% down.  Crazy, right?Like a commenter said below, buying a house isn't always a good decision.  There are all sorts of costs beyond just the mortgage payment.  And there are certain qualifications you should meet to make sure you get the best mortgage deal.  In fact, the problem with these lenders isn't that they offer bad deals--it's that they make people think buying a house is a good idea or something you're supposed to do.One more story.  I have a friend whose sister and brother-in-law got in way over their heads buying a home.  They "qualified" for a loan to buy a house there was no way they could afford (unless they never bought another car, never took vacations, never bought new clothes, never did any house repairs, and never had kids).  They were white!  And ill-informed and ill-prepared to buy a house.  My friend had to step in to save their house from foreclosure.  Moral-- if you can't get your credit score to a certain number or put at least 20% down and understand the attendant costs for homeownership, you have no business buying a house no matter what your skin color.</comment>

<comment>Because they think they should get free homes from the evil white men?</comment>

<comment>This article disturbs me. I'm a Loan Officer, and I can only speak for myself and my branch, but no. The only factors we ever consider are credit worthiness and income. I don't push anyone toward a loan that isn't going to benefit them. I don't count out the possibility that there are lenders who do this, but I don't. I guess what I'm saying is: I'm a better lender than these assholes.</comment>

<comment>THE ISSUES ARE SAME AS FOR WHITES --HOW MUCH DOWN ON THE SAME APPRAISED AMOUNT---FOR HOW MANY YEARS AND WHATS YOUR CREDIT SCORE? ALL THING EQUAL THEN YOU GET THE SAME RATE IF FROM THE SAME LENDER---THE CULPRIT MOST LIKE IS THE CREDIT SCORE AND LITTLE TO PUT DOWN---OR CAN IT BE THEY JUST DON'T KNOW TO GET MORE THAN ONE OFFER? NAY ITS OTHER STUFF--</comment>

<comment>"Prior research has found that members of these minority groups are less likely to comparison shop for mortgage products, which in turn increases the chances that they’ll wind up with the first offer they receive, and those offers tend to be expensive ones."Ignorance is the fault of the ignorant. Buyer beware. This has NOTHING to do with race unless you are saying that minorities are ignorant. I tend to believe the sage wisdom of Forrest Gump's momma, "Stupid is as stupid does." I bet these same people take payday loans, rent furniture, buy big screen TVs on store credit, and get their cars where "everybody's credit is good". If you aren't willing to educate yourself finacially, you can't blame "racism" when you get ripped of by the system. That system wants your money, no matter what color you are. If you can't manage your money, you don't deserve the big house, the nice cars and 300 channels of the Kardashians </comment>

<comment>... well, that's a bit harsh lol! So, high-priced loan sellers target suckers, and suckers buy because, basically, they come from a line of suckers, in an environment of suckers, where no one knows better. There's a pretty simple fix for this: lower priced loan sellers should advertise in black and hispanic communities and tell them there are better deals available. Why don't they do this? If this was 100% about money, they would, right?</comment>
