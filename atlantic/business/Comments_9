<comment>I loved reading this article being a big fan of the show myself (I try to watch everyday) I can see and I can tell in reading this just how much Alex loves his job. Two stories really got to me the foster care boy who needed that constant in his life and how he found it through watching Al I can relate to that, speaking as a person who has been physically struggling with health issues for years( I have Cerebral Palsy) and even more so lately The Today show has been a constant in my life and the next one is Tisha just reading those two parts brought tears to my eyes, to learn the Details behind the picture and knowing that it meant the world to her just shows me that Alex goes out of his way to do whatever he can for fans of the show and I think that says a lot about him.

<comment>You know, I had a lot of fun when I got in the Today Show's street crowd last summer, but I'm still bummed that I didn't get picked for an ambush makeover.</comment>
