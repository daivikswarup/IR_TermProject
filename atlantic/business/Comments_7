<comment>Or the best case scenario is we stop tracking ethnicity altogether.   Stop keeping track of the Jones and worry about yourself.</comment>

<comment>Translation: I am a racist who ignores structural problems facing people of different races.</comment>

<comment>Actually, no. This is bad news for those who want to be divisive about race. It shows that second and third generation (and beyond) families are identifying as American first rather than the origin of their ancestors. This is great news because it means that minorities (Hispanic and Asian) aren't doing as poorly as certain politicians would like us to believe, and that it's the newer immigrants who identify with their birth country are skewing the numbers in that direction.</comment>

<comment>Well said as well.Esp the "bad news for those who want to be divisive" part.</comment>

<comment>Huh?"Ninety-nine percent of first-generation  Hispanic immigrants identify with their ethnicity, compared to 82 percent of the third generation.The decline in identifying with the country of one’s family is even more precipitous for Asian Americans. About 96 percent of first-generation Asian immigrants participated in ethnic identification, but by the third generation that number was only 58 percent."Let me translate for you...Only 18% of 3rd generation Hispanic identify as being AMERICAN FIRST. 42% of Asians identify as AMERICAN FIRST...It shows Asians are ASSIMILATING faster than HISPANICS...If you are here for 3 generations and still identifying more with your grandparents origin, that signals a problem...NOTHING to celebrate here...Such numbers only lend weight to the arguments of those saying we need to limit immigration and enforce our laws...</comment>

<comment>Skipped the bit about certain groups no longer identifying as their ancestors did, which may be skewing the data did we?</comment>

<comment>I identify with both, my family/my people/my background, and Americans.</comment>

<comment>Add to that that we are talking 3 generations, with each one larger than the last. The third generation will still be around and VOTING 100 years from now, and the majority don't even self-identify as Americans.Our society has changed a lot in the last 100 years. What do you think will happen in the next century with so many people who don't share American values voting in our elections?</comment>

<comment>You are very self aware</comment>

<comment>ignoring other people's problems doesnt make one a racist</comment>

<comment>This is true.</comment>

<comment>Wrong.  I'm an immigrant.  A refugee, actually.  My belief is that the more you BEAT PEOPLE DOWN with the idea that they're different, they're victimized, they're helpless, they're hopeless, the worse they will do.  Liberals get a LOT out of patting immigrants on the back and telling them how sorry they feel for them, but that does immigrants no favors at all.  It merely sets them apart even more than racism.</comment>

<comment>Facing problems is tough isn't it, I just wish they didn't exist.  Would you like a hanky?</comment>

<comment>Our Constitution and our practical issues of governance require that a Census be done every 10 years.Data has limits (like "Asian" means waaaaay too many ethnicities), but ignorance has even more limits.The whole idea of the Obama proposed immigration reform was to IDENTIFY the individuals by offering a sub-group who have committed no crimes, attended and or finished school, were born here but have undocumented parents, etc., a path to citizenship that included paying a fine and going to the end of the line.The opponents of the plan want to remove them all, but they don't have the slightest idea how to find them.  It is similar to Cruz and Rubio threatening to remove the Iran deal "because they are about to get a nuclear weapon".These folks really don't follow cognitive norms.</comment>

<comment>If there's an "overestimation of the success of Asian Americans" why do we punish them with things like affirmative action in higher education?</comment>

<comment>Why do you see affirmative action in terms of punishing the allegedly better off as opposed to assisting those who are less fortunate?</comment>

<comment>"Asian"  Who is being measured here?  Hmong?  Vietnamese?  Korean?  Chinese?  Japanese?  Filipino?  Mongolian?  Pacific Islanders? Singapore? Hong Cong?"...'ese'..."This is not an accurate or a particularly helpful category, and yet many folks like you have extrapolated high achievement for "Asians" when they don't know who they are talking about.</comment>

<comment>Umm....An Asian coming to this country with a suitcase and a work ethic succeeds vs. those here for generations and plenty of advantages comparatively speaking, is better off vs. less fortunate? Give me a break...</comment>

<comment>And the Asians don't fly planes into buildings, nor shoot their coworkers at a party.</comment>

<comment>Different states have different rules and one reason west coast state universities do so well is that there is no race-based discrimination.</comment>

<comment>The whole point of the United States is to come here and assimilate so that more and more after each generation individuals no longer think of themselves as German, French, Indian, Cuban, Chinese, etc.... and think of themselves as American.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>That used to be the point for the first 200 years of our country. However, this is no longer the case according our new enlightened left-wing leaders in government and academia. According to them, since America is an evil bigoted nation, immigrants should strive not to become Americans. Instead individuals should continue to identify themselves as members of their respective ethnic groups and not assimilate. This is why the government devotes so much effort into categorizing us by groups rather than treating us as individuals.</comment>

<comment>Oh, bullshyte. Throughout our history, different ethnic groups have formed enclaves, maintaining their native customs and language.</comment>

<comment>Temporarily maintained customs and language while the government maintained a pro-assimilation policy. Now the government has an anti-assimilation policy. Hopefully, the government policy won't work.For example, my wife's grandparents immigrated from Italy and were proud of their heritage. However, they insisted that their children be Americans, learn and speak English properly and graduate high school. My wife's parents moved out of their Italian-American neighborhood, kids went to college and married outside their ethnicity. It's not a unique story.</comment>

<comment>Interesting read.But why would identification with ones race, esp generational identification,  be of such importance that it needs to be tracked?I presumed the important  identifier would be "American."</comment>

<comment>Census regulations include 'self-identifiers'.They also want to know how many in the house, how many bathrooms or even if there is indoor plumbing.The Census provided you with all kinds of stats you can use to argue against others.  Don't you just love it?</comment>

<comment>I suppose the technocrats will have to assign each of us to a race just like the old German Citizenship Laws.</comment>

<comment>No, you get to say what you identify AS.</comment>

<comment>This article is arguing against that.</comment>

<comment>I read it as "unreliable conclusions" moreso than against self-identification.But it is clear that the Census data is difficult to administer in the field.  I got one mailed to me, and filled it out online.  If nobody responds, the Census workers have to physically go to every home that doesn't and find out the facts.Ethnicity is not really a "fact."  (see Henry Louis Gates')</comment>

<comment>Now there is a shudder some mental image.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps we could use some measure of head and face shape to determine ethnicity? Like big noses, for example. Then everyone can be assigned a marker of their correct ethnicity. I mean, if we can't even do that, what will The Atlantic have left to write about?</comment>

<comment>My dad is cuban, mom is honkey doodle dandy white.How am I supposed to identify?</comment>

<comment>Florida?  I wonder if the Census has Cuban/American as a category.  Rubio's rise had me read up on Cuban history, pre-1959, and the Meyer Lansky, Lucky Luciano, Trafficante team from the Tampa mob paying off Batista to take over Havana like in the God Father.Havana Nocturne</comment>

<comment>I see you added more:Growing up my father didn't teach me spanish.

I learned spanish from a mix of puerto ricans and mexicans growing up, taking up to spanish 6 in highschool (IB program).  I ended up taking a liking to Buena Vista Social club but that is about the extent of my love of cuban music.Now Cuban food - that is a legacy I inherited from my father.

<comment>yum, cuban sandwiches.</comment>

<comment>In the census you can choose more than one, and on many forms.Also, Cuban is a nationality, Latino, an ethnicity, white, supposedly, a "race".So for you, race is white, national origin if born in Cuba, Cuban, ethnicity, Latino or Hispanic, whichever you prefer. That's simpler than many have it, because they are Black, Native American, Latinos. Try getting that through the form!</comment>

<comment>If you speak English frequently (and I do) you'll notice that your formulation actually takes the emphasis off of the American part. In English, modifiers generally proceed the noun save in a few cases where we ripped off the French ("attorneys general"). So "I am a ______ American" posits that the thing you are is fundamentally American, modified by some ethnic origin.</comment>

<comment>Well, I am just an American Redneck so the other way sounds better.</comment>

<comment>New World ethnic descriptions have very heavy Spanish and French etymological influences.</comment>

<comment>Not sure what this means... we show some deference to the person in question's language some of the time ("Quebecois", "Latino") but not consistently ("Mexican"). Is that what you mean or am I missing something?</comment>

<comment>Why do Whites not say European American or Irish, German, Italian, British American etc. </comment>

<comment>Wait, you seriously don't know any whites who identify as Italian, Irish, German or Polish American? You must have never been to the East Coast.</comment>

<comment>No- just call themselves 'Irish- American, Euro-American" etc</comment>

<comment>Are you kidding? I know tons who do. It really has to do with how recent the immigration was. British and German immigration was very early, along with much of the rest of Northern Western Europe. Poles, Swedes, Norwegians, and such immigrated in large numbers in the first half of the 19th century. It's been more than six generations, so of course the ancestral country has receded into the past. Who remembers where their great-great-great-great-grandparents came from? Who even cares?However, Italians immigrated in large numbers in the early to mid 20th century, which is only three generations ago. It's not hard to find people in their 60s whose parents were born in Italy, and though they are completely Americanized, they tend to enjoy celebrating the Mother Country. There are hundreds of Italian-American organizations around the country.Also, while whites may not identify with a particular European ethnicity, they clearly are obsessed with making sure they didn't come from some place "bad," you know? Who invented the practice of genealogical research? White people. Who set up ancestry.com? White people. Who invented DNA research? White people.Why can't white people just chill about skin color? The fact is -- and the Photoshop eye-dropper tool can prove it -- all human skin is some shade of orange.</comment>

<comment>Ha funny but actually liberals are obsessed with skin color. I love the Italian Americans. They were the end of the natural assimilation group then, prob. My best friend is Italian American from the Chicago area, but she and her family would never think about thinking of themselves differently than say me and my WASP ancestry. We think just alike with the same culture. </comment>

<comment>Well, people who actually study this disagree. They claim there are real cultural differences between, say, Italian-Americans and WASPs. Here is a reference used heavily by family therapists.http://www.amazon.com/Ethnicit...</comment>

<comment>African American immigration occurred a pretty long time ago too.</comment>

<comment>Seriously, Leftist are obsessed with race and class...Look at this article for example...White people also invented the rocket, airplane, the computer, air conditioning, mechanized agriculture etc. as you can go on and on; pretty much the modern world..You get the picture...</comment>

<comment>Who invented the internet your spewing over ?</comment>

<comment>Actually, they do. I do surveys at work. White and Asian people are very likely, when given the chance, to identify by their national origin. People do remember their heritage very well and they also mention this in focus group interviews."Irish American", "Irish", "German American", "German", etc. are very common responses when given the chance--as one would expect, because family history is very important to people.</comment>

<comment>The jews and asians really do through a wrench into your white racism conspiracy theory huh?</comment>

<comment>On the contrary, the article explains why the supposed Asian success may not be real. If only successful Asians are calling themselves Asians, while successful Hispanics don't call themselves Hispanics, then Asians will seem to be more successful than Hispanics. It's called "self-selection," and it's a real challenge in statistical field surveys.As for Jewish success, though there were many poor Jews in 19th Century America (they formed criminals gangs just like Irish and Italians did), the number of Noble prizes Jews have won strongly suggests that there really is something to it. There are various theories about why this is so, but none of them suggest American white racism has anything to do with it.http://www.pbs.org/newshour/ru...</comment>

<comment>Stop victimizing people for your own pleasure.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't affect the schools your children attend because you would never send them to a majority minority school...racist.</comment>

<comment>"Hispanic" is a lot more ambiguous term than "Asian," so it is apples and oranges.A 100% African or Amerindian person can be "Hispanic" and so can a white European.  "Asian" is limited to people with genetic roots in existing populations of Asia.</comment>

<comment>Well, Asians can be Latin American or "Latino/Hispanic" as well it's just that their presence (or history) is overlooked/ignored/glossed over or simply not acknowledged and in many cases, not even well known about. The history of "Asian Latinos" starts with the Spanish conquest of the Philippines, the Coolie trade that was also ubiquitous in Latin America, and immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries to there. It's very unique and fascinating, the history, and I don't even know all the details about it. No doubt in the US, Latinos of entirely Asian ancestry are rarity including those mixed with it but you'd be surprised with nationalities like Brazilians, Peruvians, and etc...</comment>

<comment>Asian Latinos do better than other Latinos, just like Jew Latinos...</comment>

<comment>Excellent points. Guyana, for example, is plurality Asian and its official langauge is English.  </comment>

<comment>Now that you mention Guyana... a reason to fear racial based politics. As of now there is a core group in this nation but that is changing. Trinidad? More of the same and then the people who can leave, keep on leaving."Trinidad’s makeup is 39.6% African and 40.3% East Indian vis-A-vis Guyana’s ethnic make-up 51% East Indian and 43% AfroGuyanese.’ While Guyana and Trinidad are not located in the similar geographic location sharing a similar ethnic makeup has resulted in a similar past and most likely a future where racial conflict will continue undoubtedly to affect their society. This racial divide has detrimentally affected both countries; the effects can be noticed socially, economically and politically. It will continue unless there is more regard for this fragile coexistence between East Indian and African. Politics in Trinidad followed a similar pattern with Guyana where there was a period of brief cooperation followed by an increased separation along racial lines.Since independence in 1963, two characteristics have dominated Guyanese society and politics; the presence of strong political personalities and ethnic and racial divisions based on mutual suspicion and manipulation by these strong personalities.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and they are probably excluded from being counted as watching sports channels.</comment>

<comment>Asians and Jews have done analyses themselves which show why: though more educated they still are less likely to be homeowners and less likely to make it into top management.Hm.</comment>

<comment>When you consider that a college degree in certain areas of study or special training and skill set have far more to do with a persons income, why all the focus on race.</comment>

<comment>This entire premise seems like nonsense since Tang et al. (2005) showed that 0.14% respondents chose a racial identity different from their ancestral genetics.</comment>

<comment>I find it extremely odd that more successful Asian-Americans are less assimilated. I wonder why that is.</comment>

<comment>Second-, third- and fourth-generation Mexican Americans speak English fluently, and most prefer American music. They are increasingly Protestant, and some may even vote for a Republican candidate.However, many Mexican Americans in these later generations do not graduate from college, and they continue to live in majority Hispanic neighborhoods. Most marry other Hispanics and think of themselves as "Mexican" or "Mexican American."…The study's authors, UCLA sociologists Edward E. Telles and Vilma Ortiz, examined various markers of integration among Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas, including educational attainment, economic advancement, English and Spanish proficiency, residential integration, intermarriage, ethnic identity and political involvement.Key findings from "Generations of Exclusion" include:•The educational levels of second-generation Mexican Americans improved dramatically. But the third and fourth generations failed to surpass, and to some extent fell behind, the educational level of the second generation. Moreover, the educational levels of all Mexican Americans still lag behind the national average.•Economic status improved from the first to second generation but stalled in the third and fourth generation. Earnings, occupational status and homeownership were still alarmingly low for later generations. Low levels of schooling among Mexican Americans were the main reason for lower income, occupational status and other indicators of socioeconomic status.•Adult Mexican Americans in the third and fourth generation lived in more segregated neighborhoods than they did as youths. This was due to the high number of Latinos and immigrants moving into these neighborhoods, the researchers said.•Most Mexican Americans identified as "Mexican" or "Mexican American," even into the fourth generation. Only about 10 percent identified as "American." Moreover, many Mexican Americans felt their ethnicity was very important and many said they would like to pass it along to their children.•Third- and fourth-generation Mexican Americans supported less restrictive immigration policies than the general population and generally supported bilingual education and affirmative action.•Among Hispanic 16- to 24-year-olds in the United States, 17.6 percent were high school dropouts in 2009, compared with 9.3 percent of African-Americans and 5.2 percent of whites in the same age group, although the rate for Hispanics has steadily improved, according to The Condition of Education 2011, published by the U.S. Department of Education.• Among Hispanic 25- to 64-year-olds, the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center found that 64 percent have finished high school, either by earning a standard diploma or a General Educational Development credential, compared with 90 percent of whites, 85 percent of African-Americans, and 89 percent of Asian-Americans. The EPE Research Center's graduation-rate analysis puts the on-time high school graduation rate for Hispanic students in the class of 2009 at 63 percent—slightly higher than the 59 percent rate for African-American students.• Roughly 37 percent of Hispanic 25- to 64-year-olds had completed some college coursework or an associate degree, trailing non-Hispanic whites at 63 percent, African-Americans at 53 percent, and Asian-Americans at 74 percent, according to the EPE Research Center.•Latino students who make it to college are far less likely than their black, white, and Asian-American peers to finish. In 2010, among Hispanic 25- to 29-year-olds, 14 percent had earned a bachelor's degree or higher, compared with 19 percent for African-Americans, 39 percent for whites, and 53 percent for Asian-Americans, according to The Condition of Education 2011.Many parents from Mexican-immigrant families—have had little formal education themselves, especially at the high school level, either in their home countries or the United States, Gándara says."This is really an important context for people to understand when it comes to our societal expectations that children will complete high school and, hopefully, go onto college," Gándara says. "With Latinos, children are often living in communities where no one has completed high school or even had contact with high school, and where people don't know how to go to college or why you would go to college."For Latinas, because of gender stereotypes and factors such as the pressure to make family a priority, the desire to attend college can be outmatched by the expectation that it won't be an option for them.In the Mexican-American community, children who are third generation (born to U.S.-born parents) or higher often fare worse than their relatives who were immigrants themselves or second generation, a phenomenon that has been studied in Mexican-American families."A disproportionate number, though, continue to occupy the lower ranks of the American class structure," the sociologists said. "Certainly, later-generation Mexican Americans and European Americans overlap in their class distributions. The difference is that the bulk of Mexican Americans are in lower class sectors but only a relatively small part of the European American population is similarly positioned."More than any other factor, Telles and Ortiz said, education accounted for the slow assimilation of Mexican Americans in most social dimensions. The low educational levels of Mexican Americans have impeded most other types of integration."Their limited schooling locks many of them into a future of low socioeconomic status," they said. "Low levels of education also predict lower rates of intermarriage, a weaker American identity, and a lower likelihood of registering to vote and voting."♦ EDWeek.org♦ Barbara A.

<comment>Does this article's attempt to apply the One Drop Rule to non-blacks make sense?</comment>

<comment>People also mis-attribute race. I am not white but for some reason in all paperwork I have to correct people to  note my non-white background. When I'm in casual clothes in day to day life, people easily identify me as a minority and even comment. When I am wearing a suit or speaking on the phone or communicating by e-mail, because I have an ambiguous last name I suppose, people mark me as white. So officially, I am white to the federal government in every single program that I didn't mark the ethnicity myself.I don't understand why or how this is. It's like people hear me speak and think I cannot possibly be from a minority group, although I speak like my father and cousins who all live in the community.I find it very odd and disconcerting. However, given that I know racism exists, I'm loathe to correct them and ask them to put my true ethnicity and race on forms. I don't want to lose my advantage, since I feel I've impressed them enough to think I couldn't possibly be "one of them".</comment>

<comment>Im curious, what do you mean by "white"? The technical ethnic term of "caucasion" really refers to everyone of Indo-Aryan descent (hence theoretized to have come out of the Caucuses in the last major migration) and would include Arabs, Persians, Jews, Indians, North Africans, Greeks, and Europe as a whole.</comment>

<comment>Here's the data.  The numbers for Asians are driven down by the fact that many Indians don't identify as Asians, even first generation Indians (only 94% of US immigrants born in India consider themselves Asian).Hispanic, 3rd generation:3-4 grandparents born in a relevant country: 97% identify as Hispanic2 grandparents born in a relevant country: 87% identify as HispanicAsian, 3rd generation:3-4 grandparents born in a relevant country: 90% identify as Asian2 grandparents born in a relevant country: 76% identify as Asian</comment>

<comment>It's complicated by the fact that many Indians don't consider India as part of Asian.  When they hear the word Asian, they think Chinese.Veteran reporter Robert Fisk described being questioned by a Lebanese border guard on his first visit about his business there.  He told them he was his newspapers middle-eastern correspondent, to which the guard asked "And where is this 'middle-east'?"</comment>

<comment>You had me at "Specifically, research has suggested that Asian immigrants tend to do better once arriving in the U.S.—quickly earning college degrees and climbing the economic ladder—than Hispanic immigrants"-Mean IQ of 106 verses 89</comment>

<comment>The simple answers is that Mexican, Brazilian, etc. are not ethnicity but nationalities. Even "latino" largely ignores ethnicity to describe a recent geographic origin. Within Latin America there are ethnic stratifications of Caucasians originating from Spain, Blacks from Africa, Natives, Indians, and mixtures thereof.Our use of "latino" as an ethnic description is a symptom of systemic racism. It doesn't matter if you are a blue eyed blond haired Mexican of pure European decent, or a Brazilian black with a more pure descent from slaves than many US blacks. You are really "white" or "black" because you come from one of "those" countries.</comment>

<comment>i think this data strikes at one of the most fundamental issues with our immigration policies. We are witnessing the Balkanization of the United States. Political correctness has discouraged the idea of immigration assimilation that was prevalent during Theodore Roosevelts generation; if you came here, it was to be an American. Now people immigrate here and retain the cultural identity of the original country. The result, Miami is not really an American city anymore. If you do not speak Spanish, you will have a very hard time aquireing a meaningful job. Miami is an extension of Cuba. Michigan is turning into the Middle East. The San Bernadino represents another aspect regarding the lack of assimilation.Instead of demanding immigrants adjust more, we are eroding our civil rights with regard to privacy. The NSA spied on all Americans. The FBI is pushing Apple to further compromise our right to privacy. We are holding people in Guantanamo with out due process. In my mind this is as unamerican as you can get. Why?Business wants cheap labor! It is disrupting to society.</comment>

<comment>Garbage in - garbage out.</comment>

<comment>Immigrants and minorities are increasingly a major force in America. They and the children they bear account for 60 percent of our nation’s population growth, own 11 percent of US businesses, and are 60 percent more likely to start a new business than native-born Americans. In fact, forty percent of Fortune 500 companies were started by an immigrant or a child of an immigrant, creating 10 million jobs and seven out of ten top brands in our country.   More importantly, the vast majority of these human beings—both legal and undocumented—come to improve their lives and create a foundation of success for their children to build upon, bringing skills and a willingness to work hard to make their dreams a reality, something our founders did four hundred years ago, and something we would do today if we were in their shoes.   Theodore Roosevelt: “We should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an American and assimilates himself to us, he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else, for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed, or birthplace, or origin.”   However, most struggle in their efforts and need guidance in Anytown, USA. Perhaps intelligent immigration reform, White House/Congress and business/labor cooperation, concerned citizens and informative books can extend a helping hand, the same unwavering hand, lest we forget, that has been the anchor and lighthouse of American values for four hundred years.   One new award-winning worldwide book/ebook that reaches out to help immigrants, int’l students and minorities and is endorsed by ambassadors, educators, and editors is "What Foreigners Need To Know About America From A To Z: How to Understand Crazy American Culture, People, Government, Business, Language and More.”   Here’s a closing quote from the book’s Intro: “With all of our cultural differences though, you’ll be surprised to learn how much…we as human beings have in common on this little third rock from the sun. After all, the song played at our Disneyland parks around the world is ‘It’s A Small World After All.’ Peace.”</comment>

<comment>I love liberals.  They tell us race is a construct, yet the minute minorities stop using this identifier, liberals will go through whatever hoops to make sure race and ethnicity are represented in their evaluation.  To the authors, the people who do not self-identifying are actually identifying as ---- Americans!  What the authors miss too, is that as a family is here in the US, they are extremely likely to intermarry with someone of another race - most often white.  Those children then identify as white.  This is important because this article and intermarriage rates demonstrate the Democrats are foolish to pin their election hopes for the future on 'demographics.  Basically this country is and always will be white Immigrant (waiting to be white through time and marriage to become white) and black.   The only group that cannot move - no matter how many times it inter-marries is black (Obama case in point). Sorry Democrats, today's Asians and Hispanics will be tomorrows Italians, irish and Jews.   BTW Irish and Italians use to pull the Demo lever.  Not any more :)</comment>
