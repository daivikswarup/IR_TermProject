<comment>Actually in the most recent updates for the game, they've added a whole host of mass transit options, including dedicated lanes for buses and taxis, bicycle paths, street trams, and more. Pedestrian footpaths have been present since release, and most people never seem to make effective use for them. I have, and I love watching my citizens make use of them.I do agree mixed-use zoning would be nice. You can sort of emulate it by manually mixing up your zoning assignments on a building-level basis, but it'd be nice if there was a more elegant solution.</comment>

<comment>Cities:Skylines is an outstanding game, and a much more worthy inheritor of the SimCity mantle than the recent iterations of the original.</comment>

<comment>Truer words have probably been spoken but these are not bad.</comment>

<comment>I always felt that CS was pretty weak on the management side of things.  Look at crime for instance, it's pretty banal, and you combat it by just putting down police stations or prisons.  There is no specific crimes, i.e., drug crime, petty, capital offenses. I'd thought it be interesting if they added a diversity of crime, then as mayor, you can enact different polices and edicts to try to combat crime.  Maybe specialize certain police stations or something. Fund different programs to combat different crimes.The game is more like a big canvas, and you create a nice looking city, but the management aspect isn't that great.  The only real management aspect is transportation, everything else is fairly basic.</comment>

<comment>(Comment originally posted on City Observatory)I've been playing Cities Skylines for a few months.1. If you want to build road networks, Skylines is the better game; if you want to build transit networks, Cities in Motion 2 is preferable.2. In combination with the Traffic Manager President Edition and Network Extensions Project mods, Skylines traffic modeling capabilities are powerful enough to make one wonder if they really are playing a consumer-grade game! Traffic Manager allows for control of signal phasing and lane direction, while the Network Extensions Project introduces wider and narrower road types, including pedestrianized roads. To be fair, I have not tried to create large-scale pedestrian districts, so I do not know how well it works.3. If you don't want mods, the base game does have pedestrian paths... in the parks menu. They function more like roads than parks, and should have been placed in the roads menu.4. Cities Skylines, like all consumer games, has to appeal to transpo nerds like us as well as people who are in middle school (and wouldn't find signal phasing, local governance, etc fun to manage). I believe that the game developers have done an excellent job in creating a game that is both approachable yet is able to be further modded for us who want to basically run a city traffic department.</comment>

<comment>This is a good video game review but I think this article is more of a critique of American car culture and zoning. If the default settings in the game encourage the user to create highways and doesn't allow mixed use zoning, it seems like the user is taught that a city must look like Atlanta not Paris.</comment>

<comment>So true. Although, as an Atlanta native, I'd like to point out that the city proper itself is not really the problem, rather, it's the massive, far-flung suburban sprawl  of all its satellite cities and counties that is the problem.Add to that our incredibly stupid federal government, which (as it did to many of our cities), plowed two freeways (US I-75 and I-85) straight through the middle and heart of downtown Atlanta, completely ruining the city's character.Highways should connect cities and towns, not pass through them.</comment>

<comment>From what I have read it is actually possible to take land totally out of the states control to the extent that they will respect a no fly zone over it. The concept of cities is tied to mono cropping so a city is a kind of human mono crop with some exceptions like the lawn is a grass monocrop that can exist in a city. Then outside the city you get the farming monocrops to feed the city monocrop. This is some sort of idea of seperating everything out. If you imagine 2 circles a small one and a larger one with the city being the inner circle and the outer one being the farm lands this is basically the model as in europe evolved out of feudalsm. At one time earlier on though it was the inverse. The people lived in gardens with a biodiverse system in the outer space and the inner circle was empty used for festivities when the people would come together for a celebration.-ty2a suffix occurring in nouns of Latin origin, denoting quality, state, etc.:unity; enmity.< Latin cīvitāt- (stem of cīvitās) citizenry, town, equivalent to cīvi (s) citizen + -tāt- -ty2A related word is metropolis from the greek where you get words like police policy politics. The word man was once also gender neutral but has since widely been accepted as referring to males although it remains in the word mankind and the german mensch but not man cave.Another interesting one is apartment. 1635-45; < French appartement < Italian appartamento, equivalent to apparta (re) to separate, divide (verbal derivative of a parte apart, to one side) + -mento -ment</comment>

<comment>I'd love to see a citation or two for what you've said. If it can be substantiated, it paints a beautiful possibility of human civilizations arcing from an orientation to celebrations through much growth and change, back to an orientation to celebrations.</comment>

<comment>But what if we're using a simulation like this to generate a new city from scratch on relatively uninhabited land? That seems to address your concerns.</comment>

<comment>It's a game, not a true to life simulation.</comment>

<comment>How close can a societal simulation get to real life? If you have expertise in this, I'd love to discuss it with you.</comment>

<comment>I 'played' the very first Sim City and haven't played since.  I never really understood the attraction.  The same friend that had that game then got Age of Empires, which led me to buy Civilization.  Out of the box Civilization seems a bit biased culturally, but the great thing is almost everything in it is modifiable.  Not everything, but most things can be tweaked, changed or added to.  I think that's the secret of a great game, it's actually a game's development platform sold with one implemented example game.  Civ helped my nephew when he was only eight get into computers, through modding files and animating flc's to create new units, debugging procedures etc.  The more a developer can open up their source code for customisation the better.</comment>

<comment>I'm a pretty big city builder fan and, like you, have been playing them from childhood.That said, nothing, to this day, has topped Sim City 4 : Rush Hour as far as really driving home the interplay between transit systems, the organic growth of cities, civics and people movement.  Nothing.  I bought Skylines thinking that maybe it would be approximate, especially after being disappointed by both the New Sim City (which sucked, for the most part) and Cities XL (and XXL and whatever) which was basically a really opaque, not nearly as well designed version of SC 4.Skylines...fell short of the mark.  I never felt like I got the best grasp on how the game engine wanted to pump population.  I would build resi and then com with Industrial and I figured I could go in the same cycle as SC4, where you zone out and then let it saturate...then re-apply zoning to up the density but it just never seemed to come around as 'tight' as I'd like it, meaning that I'd get bogged with huge amounts of sprawl while it seemed like there were never enough people moving in to pump the budget to allow me to expand.    SC4 was a really good Keynesian simulator in a way where the optimal tactic was to deficit spend a little bit laying out new zones and transit connects and then the population would grow and fill the void and make up the deficit, putting you in the black.  Skylines also doesn't really give you a grand 'all tied together as a city' feeling either.  With SC4 you'd set up industrial and it would immediately demand access to other regions, e.g. access off the map to ship freight to the outside world.   After decades of building you'd have built and rebuilt industrial and commercial..I guess nuclei...that showed how it all fit together.   Very organic and Skylines is lacking that completely.Oy, I could go on for an hour about this..but I'll spare anyone who's reading this..I don't know how Maxis did it back in the day but they did and the result was SC4:RH.  I really cannot sing that game enough praises even though it's like 12 years old at this point. Nothing..and I do mean nothing...has topped it.  Watching sims choose routes to get around the city is worth the learning curve alone.  Going from on foot, to a subway, to on foot and then to the office.  Or car to park-and-ride, to train, to metro...to on foot.  Just amazing if you're a transit/city builder geek like me.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  I think the problem is SC4:RH may have been too complicated for little kids though.  So they sort of rolled things back with the next version.  But I agree its the best of the Simcitys so far - even though it came out in 2003.  And then you throw the NAM mod on it and its even better.  Definitely one of my favorite games of all time.</comment>

<comment>HAHAHAHAHA! You're last screen shot is the Springfield Mixing Bowl. Too Late!</comment>

<comment>I was thinking it seemed very much like the intersection of the Cross Bronx, the Bruckner, and the Hutchinson River Parkway (and nearby intersections).</comment>

<comment>Don't forget 95.   God, for as massive as that interchange is...it sure does bog down a lot.</comment>

<comment>I'm a big tropico 4 fan. In Tropico you have to build parking garages if you want people to get where they need to go.</comment>

<comment>Tropico 4 is a great (and often overlooked) city builder!</comment>

<comment>Tropico 5 on the other hand feels like a sad throw back to the early aughts.</comment>

<comment>Yeah it's odd how much they simplified it.  Tropico 4 was a nice balance of simplicity with the ability to micro-manage if you wanted to.</comment>

<comment>pretty stupid to ignore communityBack in 1968 i remember hearing a lot of noise coming from Broadway - turned out to be a huge march for community control of schools - decentralization - and everyone was going to Brooklyn, over the bridge.   Try putting THAT into Sim City.or may Sin City</comment>

<comment>Playing city builders since childhood (Sim City 3000 then 4 then Cities XL then CS), the way I see it, they all share most of the problems you cited.Actually, I would say avoiding the often long negociating-with-other-authorites stuff is part of the appeal to those games: you do whatever you want, problems always have solutions, no one contests your power... Even money can stop being an issue, just by turning on an option !These games focus on building incredible cities with tons of buildings, complex transportation systems and developing always more your city. From my perspective, they do very well, but more transportation options, mixed-zoning and more policies would find their place in the game very well. Also, if they could bring some sort of Cities XL-like big structures building progressively, this would be nice. The building process is often left behind in those games.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm must have been playing the base game without mods or the two DLCsAnyway I also play CS with several mods attached:1) Network Extensions and Traffic++ V2. I can build different roads including dedicated bus ways and shared roads the pedestrians love to amble over and foul up the traffic good and proper. Traffic++ V2 also allows me to control who goes into what lanes and where each set of lanes go at an intersection.2) Rush Hour (Beta): Installed it yesterday and oh heck the game went up a notch. The mod has slowed the game time down and you get both morning and afternoon rush hours and with random events massive, pile outs of the stadiums.3) With Snowfall Trams are now present so we get a different dynamic in play with the mass transit system. In short: LRT for short distance, Bus for medium distance, subway for up to longish distance, heavy rail for going across the map.As with Mixed zoning, I have always wanted this but I remember Maxis with Sim City saying the pathfinder program was a struggle to write to allow a mixed use building to work. That said that was in 2003 and this is 2016 so how hard is it to work out a resident staying within the building for work.Still the game gives as good as it gets and still countless hours of frustration as you get death waves and endless congestion :-P</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that spaghetti highway does exist... in Dallas.</comment>

<comment>Besides the Vietnam War, single-use zoning is about the dumbest thing the US has ever done. Basing practically our entire society around the automobile, we've created a physical disaster of our built environment. A brutal public domain.Sure, we do the private realm great. Maybe no one does it better. But the very existence of that cul-de-sac you live on should tell you that in order to access the greater area, you're going to be sitting in traffic.Suburban sprawl is a Ponzi scheme: It only works if it continues to sprawl. And it never pays for itself, because there is never enough tax-base to fund the far-flung roads, sewer systems, electrical cables, and other utilities and services, including fire, police, and emergency medical services.And people who live in now rare traditional, more efficient REAL neighborhoods, are taxed higher--along with everybody else, whether they drive a car or not-- to pay for the inefficient, ever greenfield-gobbling sprawl.And guess what? The design of pleasant, grid-based cities like old Savannah, Ga., and Charleston S.C, or Georgetown in DC, would be ILLEGAL TO BUILD with today's ridiculous American zoning laws.Have you ever noticed when they advertise luxury cars, they show them gently cruising through walkable, pedestrian-friendly, mixed-use, human-scale European villages with no other cars around? They'd of course never show the reality: Masses of cars in horrible, congested traffic and gridlock.Yeah, I know. You wanted your idyllic "homestead in the wilderness". But unfortunately, so did 85 Million other people, so now you live in either cheap track housing, or audacious cookie-cutter sub-divisions and grotesque McMansions.</comment>
