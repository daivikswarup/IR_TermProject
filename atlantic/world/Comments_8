<comment>And yet all the Republican primary candidates are anti-immigration.</comment>

<comment>We wouldn't need immigration if you would stop murdering babies.</comment>

<comment>Would you right wingnuts advocate sufficient public assistance  to support the raising and educating  the un-murdered babies?</comment>

<comment>Who is forcing you to have babies you can't afford? And do you really think we need to consume MORE of the Earth's resources?! The oceans are dying for crying out loud. </comment>

<comment>And? Why is immigration a good thing? How did immigration work out for the American Indians?! Imperialist always think immigration is wonderful.</comment>

<comment>Japan can start replacing their native population with Middle Easterners through immigration, though it will probably be a drag for the shrinking native population when the newcomer majority start dynamiting or burning old Shinto and Buddhist temples and beheading native Japanese as idolaters and practicers of shirk. Japan will be a lot less sushi and a lot more shawarma. Too bad for the native sake industry, too. That and all those pork dishes are not going to fare well under sharia. But think of all the pro-Jihadist anime that will result from this!</comment>

<comment>The Balkanization of many places in Asia and Africa, plus the Balkans, failed. The only reason why Australia, Canada and England's multiculturalism isn't literally destroying their nations are: they tend to pick the best possible immigrants and their immigrants tend to reflect their core values and norms even though coming from a multitude of places.Multiculturalism in the US favors one particular group whose ability to contribute to the economy is limited and who overwhelm other immigrant groups with their numbers, immigrants who tend to have the values and attitudes (+education) that pushes them to be middle class.</comment>

<comment>I thought all the business leaders who supported more H1B's are Republicans.</comment>

<comment>And yet most Democrats claim to believe in anthropogenic climate change and environmentalism. </comment>

<comment>Japan should start inviting in large numbers of immigrants from the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa.</comment>

<comment>Sad story for Japan . I wonder if their "Lost Decades" contributed to this?Psychologically I am sure it has stunted the vaunted power of 1980's MITI.  If they still had their confidence and power they would have created some social engineering program to have prevented  it.</comment>

<comment>Sad story ? How ? I've heard the Japanese are quite fine with their country</comment>

<comment>Yeah sure. I doubt you would get a NO response from a large number of 60-70 year olds to the question "Would you like to have more grandchildren and great-grandchildren?"  This is the generation that came out of the war, and lived during Japan's glory years.</comment>

<comment>No grandparent would ever say no to more grandchildren.</comment>

<comment>Ridiculous. Not everyone support mindless procreation. I'll be very upset if my daughter grows up,to have more than two children. It is not, barring radical scientific advances, a moral choice to have more. </comment>

<comment>How could they possibly be? It doesn't have diversity. Places that aren't polyglot, multicultural "salad bowls" of diverse immigrants each trying to angle for political and financial benefits and squabbling amongst each other and the native population base aren't worth living in.</comment>

<comment>What is sad about reducing the population to levels where people actually feel capable of raising a family? I guess you have never been to Japan and seen how crowded it is.</comment>

<comment>Why sad?  It's not like they are going extinct or something.  Most of them are just deciding to have 1 kid.</comment>

<comment>Not sad, responsible.  South Korea is approaching the same situation. You cheerleaders for perpetual growth are just ensuring environmental catastrophe, yet you probably sneer at Republican climate change deniers. </comment>

<comment>Japanese women are often very beautiful.  Why not have sexual relations with them?</comment>

<comment>You obviously haven't ever dated any Japanese woman. Looks are not the issue. Culture and ideas matter. </comment>

<comment>And why, exactly, do you Russians have a rapidly decreasing population? Not that it is bad thing, at all...</comment>

<comment>Yeap. Male Russian lifespan has gone down by 2.5 years since the1950's</comment>

<comment>Japan is incredibly over-populated. They need to keep shrinking their population. If they slash their population they will eventually be able to live in harmony with their environment. Why is that such a bad thing? </comment>

<comment>No immigration....no problem.  Of all the developed countries, Japan seems to have the least amount of internal social discourse.</comment>

<comment>Don't you mean  "discord" (conflict) rather than "discourse" (communication)?Japan is a very polite, peaceful, and safe society. But it can also be seen as a very conformist, dull, and lonely one.</comment>

<comment>There are, of course, major social problems in Japan just like in any other country. A disproportionate number of their teenage boys are quite screwed up-- Japanese commentators themselves worry about how many of them barely leave their bedrooms.</comment>

<comment>They also have a stagnant and shrinking economy and HUGE public debt burden.</comment>

<comment>Japan is a country that is overpopulated and who do a great job saving up for retirement.  A shrinking population is exactly what they need and they are well equipped to handle an aging population.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, most ordinary Japanese people's savings are in Japanese government bonds that depend upon future Japanese taxes for repayment. In other words, elderly Japanese people's savings is directly harmed by the declining tax base.</comment>
