<comment>Saville openly bragged about his reputation  with young girls. And would squeeze the rear ends of under age girls on tv shows like Top of the Pops. How could BBC management not have known about his reputation?</comment>

<comment>They did know, they just thought it was acceptable.  The real question is why aren't any BBC directors and senior staff facing lengthy prison sentences today?  Why won't Margret Thatcher be remembered as the first openly paedo PM?</comment>

<comment>One of my relatives lived in the suburb of Leeds where he had his mansion, and apparently it was well known that a few heavies would be round your house to encourage your silence if you mouthed off about him in public.And I heard this five years or so before we found out about his crimes.</comment>

<comment>"Lorraine Goes to Livingston" - Irvine Welsh, 1996Clearly Jimmy Savile before he became a 'Sir', and just from general innuendo, as Welsh never worked in the BBC or NHS.  We live in a pornocracy, and I say that as someone pro-porn.  Our celebrities, our police, our judiciary, our politicians and our aristocracy are mostly all psychopathic paedophiles.Not just Savile, but Tony Blackburn, Stuart Hall, Dave Lee Travis, all paid for and indulged on your mandatory licence fee.  Never mind David Bowie, Gary Glitter, Led Zep etc .  Prince Andrew anyone?These abusers make a compelling argument for a death penalty, a slow death penalty.</comment>

<comment>It's not only the BBC who kept this secret.  Members of his family did likewise.  He came from a very poor family (his mother was one of 14 children and spent time at an orphanage whilst her parents were still alive).  He apparently gave them money, so they just shut-up, even after he molested a family member.</comment>

<comment>Yet they go unpunished just like he did.  Margret Thatcher knighted him as did John Paul II, which shows what their moral compass pointed to.</comment>

<comment>Add to this the Rotherham scandal, where the police conspired with a ring of child sex abusers, and the Marie Black child sex ring, where authorities apparently investigated the conduct of Norwich social services.  How many more incidents of powerful people covering up terrible crimes have we yet to learn about?</comment>

<comment>A girl alleged a policeman in Aberdeen raped her, and she and her uncle were murdered.  Credibly alleged imo.  No names because it is still going on.  The police here infiltrated the peace movement with rapists and paedos as spys.I passed some evidence on to local cops, and was punished for that.  I then discussed it with someone rated one of the top ten legal minds in Scotland, and he told me I'd ran head first into the brick wall of the establishment paedophilia cover-up.  They do murder people who try to expose them.</comment>

<comment>Just more of the elite class that play with the public like dolls. Literally! </comment>

<comment>John "Rotten" Lydon mentioned it on radio in the 1970s. It's out there on YouTube.Nearly every rock superstar has their stories as well: Zeppelin, Bowie, Stones, Ringo, Marc Bolan, etc, etc. The list goes on and on.To be honest, nobody really cared back then. Young girls went groupie seeking these experiences. Everybody knew it, though perhaps not the detailed specifics. Watch the movie "Pretty Baby", which was a mainstream movie, to see where the culture's head was at.It will be interesting to see where Sex Mores are in 40 years, and which of today's "heroes" will be publicly flogged for today's "normalized behavior".</comment>

<comment>If the BBC had just fired him, he'd never have had a platform to abuse women and children on.  I used to have some respect for the BBC.Jim'll Fix it was a show on TV all through my childhood and I did find him a little creepy</comment>

<comment>What I don't understand is why someone didn't have him beat up by a gang or something.  He seemed to avoid that during all his 80-something years, despite engaging in all kinds of perversions.</comment>
