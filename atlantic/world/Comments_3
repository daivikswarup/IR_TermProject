<comment>I endorse closure as long as all of the detainees are first used as shark bait.</comment>

<comment>I hate being overseas drinking cheap Russian vodka that will blind you in an hour- I thought I was logged in to the Atlantic- home of free college, free healthcare, free housing, free food . free automobile repair. My mistake.Kindest Regards Heh! Heh!,</comment>

<comment>The cheap Moscali vodka will kill you. Better to switch to 100% pure Agave. When the shooting starts, all Patriots will need clear eyes.</comment>

<comment>I love the argument that we should close it because our enemies don't like it.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I can see the adds now..."Join the Jihad and see Gitmo"</comment>

<comment>Ironic that these Islamic beasts enjoy a higher standard of living at Club Gitmo than the hellholes they come from.</comment>

<comment>And plenty of dudes since they're all gay is a plus.</comment>

<comment>Gitmo as a recruiting tool has always been a canard.Jihadis have no compunction about blowing up civilians, sawing journalists heads off, burning people alive in cages, and using captured women and girls as sex slaves.People being detained without a trial does not offend their humanitarian sensibilities.  </comment>

<comment>You mean some of them were not as interested to read Boumediene v. Bush as I was?</comment>

<comment>I believe he is free. noKindest Regards</comment>

<comment>Obama is a recruitment tool.</comment>

<comment>Right... which is TOTALLY why he was the one who got Osama instead of Bush.</comment>

<comment>You mean Osama? No, a determined CIA operative and Seal Team 6 got him. Al Qaida wasn't doing the job of taking over the West fast enough, so the president fired him and hired ISIS.</comment>

<comment>But which president was in charge when the operation was authorized?</comment>

<comment>The same one that has done far more damage to our security than the killing of one man can provide.</comment>

<comment>Say his name.Say the name of the president who was in office when Osama Bin Laden, the leader of Al Qaeda, was killed.</comment>

<comment>President Mom Jeans, or as Lt. Col. Ralph Peters calls him...Big Pussy.</comment>

<comment>HAHA!I love watching people like yourself talk themselves in circles.  So bitter.  So sad.But very conservative.</comment>

<comment>You shouldn't worship a president.</comment>

<comment>Pup, what a travesty to waste the only life you are given.. Watching msnbc and awaiting Bernie to deliver your fair share. Blaming Bush for the housing collapse and blaming him for the arise of isis. I don't know what to say junior.  If you think cutting islamists free is the way to go - you go girl- you can't fix stupid!Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>People can call Obama a lot of things, but he is no pussy.  Obama does not hesitate to kill lots of people with his drones and if there is some collateral damage, those seem like bonus points to O.  I can't stand the guy, but in all fairness, I cannot call him a pussy.</comment>

<comment>Barry Hussein .pup. Who without the enhanced interrogation employed by our intell community at the time would still be alive today. Go circle jerk your little liberal buddies about all that is awesome about barry!Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>El Presidente Bamboozala.Better?</comment>

<comment>HA!I love how petty you losers are.</comment>

<comment>Petty, no, the truth hurts doesn't it shill.Do you get your nose out far enough to see the sunlight often?</comment>

<comment>If OBL had been killed under Bush, I would've given him some credit.  If I didn't, I'd be a brainless partisan.The US is pretty safe.  The media and our politicians work overtime to scare us.  Obama's done a fine job on national security from what I can tell, and the things I think he messed up on haven't made us materially less safe.</comment>

<comment>right, that Russian reset is working out pretty good!</comment>

<comment>So if Kennedy was the President when you were born, is he your daddy?</comment>

<comment>He was asleep as he was during Benghazi.</comment>

<comment>Our intelligence services and the U.S. military did that.   Obama just took the credit.</comment>

<comment>He hid and played card games with Reggie Love, who said he was a nervous wreck. Not exactly an Eisenhower moment.http://www.mediaite.com/tv/reg...</comment>

<comment>An Eisenhower wouldn't even crack the Republican primaries in this day and age, sweet pea. Far too liberal for the neocons.Also, you're aware we have photos of Obama and his officials in the situation room during the operation, right?Right? </comment>

<comment>For a short while. So his 'friend' lied? </comment>

<comment>Lying about Obama is a popular national pastime in this country, at least for neoconservatives.Did you miss the whole 'birther' controversy?</comment>

<comment>Von, tell me, which president was in office when the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden was authorized?</comment>

<comment>Clinton had chances but pass on it.   Bush went after Bin laden and decimated al Qaeda.   Bush did all the work for Obama t simply give the OK to kill him.    Obama now frees terrorists and makes nice with them. </comment>

<comment>So......you're saying Obama was the president in office when the operation to kill Osama Bin Laden succeeded?Why, I think you're correct!</comment>

<comment>you said 'he was the one who got' OBL. Now it's just in office, there is a difference.Can you imagine FDR talking about how he got Hitler, much less Ike who was much closer to it.you are buying into his narcissism.</comment>

<comment>It's not my fault the treasonous neocons in this country can't face facts.It's just really, really fun to rile you guys up by reminding you of what epic failures you are.</comment>

<comment>treasonous neocons, as opposed to the treasonous democons.</comment>

<comment>Say what you will about Democrats, but the notion that we should do nothing in opposition to a president is unique to Republicans.  As much as we all despised Bush, Democrats were willing to keep the core functions of government in place, and we even saw a few advancements during his presidency, such as the expansion of Medicare.Republicans are traitors, do-nothing, petulant, pre-school level traitors. And, as much as I dislike Obama, it's impressive the level of progress his presidency has seen in the face of traitorous obstruction on all levels. </comment>

<comment>Traitors.A word so misused by so many.Your last comments tells it all."it's impressive the level of progress his presidency has seen in the face of traitorous obstruction on all levels."And you are an Obama supporter as your statement clearly gives you away.</comment>

<comment>I support some of the things he's done, yes.  I also criticize where he's failed or betrayed his own ideals, such as his support of torture and Bush 'War on Terror' policies.Economically, he's been a breath of fresh air.  We've added jobs to our economy for six years straight, reversing a monthly job loss of 800,000 to a million when he took office.  We're not getting Americans killed by foolishly entering into wars we don't need to be in, and we're leveraging ALL of our military options (including sanctions) rather than sending young American soldiers into war zones to die.Plus, it was Obama who got Osama Bin Laden.The difference between you and I is I can acknowledge successes and failures.  I'm not a pathetic, little sycophant.</comment>

<comment>You started out well.  Ended with the typical progressive name calling.No thanks.</comment>

<comment>Not riled up, just getting ready to cleanup the mess this lot has made in the world (again).Adults will be back in charge soon.</comment>

<comment>"Clean up the mess"?It was neocons' 'mess' that got Obama elected, twice and destabilized Iraq. (Likely permanently.)Well, that and the fact that he didn't start wars in the wrong country, destroy the economy (quite the opposite, in fact), or betray our core values internationally. I won't vote for Hillary, but the knowledge that she won't invade a country and get 6,000 Americans killed just to avenge her daddy is comforting.I hope you have some very strong liquor on tap for after Election Day!  HAHA!</comment>

<comment>And you ignore the fact Obama administration via foreign policy decisions or lack of  has destabilized Libya, Egypt and further destabilized Syria.  Curious you ignore the present for the past.</comment>

<comment>False on all fronts.With bipartisan support we engaged in limited military action in Libya, killing Gadhafi.  Then we got the !@#$ out.  That was the plan the entire time, and though the aftereffects aren't what we expected, Obama did what the consensus among federal legislators told him to do.  Sure we could have sent in ground troops and stayed for another ten years, as you neocons would have loved, but Obama's smarter than that.Syria has very little to do with us.  Our involvement was to get the Assad government to stop using chemical weapons, and we succeeded.  Republicans though, it should be noted, wanted to arm ISIS 'the rebels'.  It's a really good thing Obama didn't listen to John McCain and Lindsey Graham on that one.I'm not sure how you figure Egypt is Obama's fault, unless you want to blame him for every single incident of unrest worldwide.  You probably want to blame him for Boko Haram too.</comment>

<comment>'You think killing a country's leader and then doing nothing is the right thing to do?  Damn amateurs.In Syria, we should have been clear that we only wanted the chemical weapons gone and not kept claiming "Assad must Go' that screws up the world.In Egypt we brought screwing up to a whole new level by both demanding that a long time stability figure in the Middle East step down ( "transition must begin now") and then we back the more radical Islamist as they tried and failed to gain power.  That twofer showed the world that even though we have no clue what we are doing, we will not stand behind our traditional allies.Send the clown back to Chicago, he cannot operate on the world stage.</comment>

<comment>Funny, Obama and Biden both said that Iraq was stable, until it wasn't.I mean the messes in Syria, Iran, Crimea, South China sea, Yemen, North Africa and the impact of those mistakes around the world,We then need to rebuild our relationships with our allies in the middle east and Europe.Every administration leaves problems, but this is a mess.</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the growing army of people who won't be voting for Hillary.Is it because of the 150 FBI agent that are now rooting through her rackets?  Her painfully obvious lack of talent for her chosen profession?  Her role in attacking the victims of her predator of a husband?  Her ability to corrupt the DNC so that even if she looses, she still gets the nomination?  Cheering leader Wallstreet? Foundation that is really just a slush fund?Or do you just not want a woman to get ahead.</comment>

<comment>Merely posting your infantile comments doesn't rile anyone up as much as it invites everyone to pity the people who have to endure you in real life.</comment>

<comment>Endure me?Heh.  You guys are so insecure you can't even admit that Bush didn't get Osama Bin Laden, because it hurts your little feelings.But it does make you spectacular, obedient goose-stepping conservatives.  You probably got all misty-eyed when Jebby said: "My brother kept us safe!", ignoring the fact that Bush failed to stop the worst terrorist attack that's ever occurred on US soil. </comment>

<comment>The old "who was in office" canard.  I guess FDR is responsible for Pearl Harbor, and Harry Truman for killing Hitler.  You do realize when you say Obama got Osama you sound like a complete idiot?</comment>

<comment>Did that all by himself did he.Or did he do a mother may I and others did the work?Did he also save the economy with no help in a dark closet?</comment>

<comment>AND WHY THEN DOES JFK GET CREDIT FOR THE MOON LANDING? NIXON?  NOTE TOO HOW WHEN THEY TRY TO SLAM BUSH FOR NOT GETTING HIM YET CLINTON COULD NOT FIND RUDOLPH FOR 5 YEARS AND HE WAS ON US SOIL--YOURS A CRAP ARGUMENT!</comment>

<comment>Gitmo is yet another example of our hypocrisy as a nation.We masquerade as a country that respects human rights, while at the same time torturing POW's (and giving them a euphemistic name to claim we're not), bombing innocent civilians, pushing economic policies that starve whole nations (Which is why OBL targeted us to begin with), destroying the homes of millions and displacing them, and all the while stealing the natural resources of countries we claim to be helping. For added fun, we have our own soldiers exposing the lies we've told ourselves about all of these issues, and we fully endorse the torture of the whistleblowers as well.Gitmo's not the problem, just a symptom.  Our hypocrisy on the issue of human rights is the problem, and partly why America is a recruiting tool for terrorist groups. </comment>

<comment>So....is terrorism or the mass rape of women or the slavery of children an example of hypocrisy by Islamic nations?</comment>

<comment>For the ones who claim to respect human rights, yes.What I'm wondering is why you think: "Hey, they do this stuff too!"  somehow makes it okay for us to betray our own professed ideals. </comment>

<comment>Is holding people without charges for a decade for holding people without charges hypocrisy by the West?</comment>

<comment>These "people" are Islamists who would love to lop your head off.</comment>

<comment>That's a threat.  You are threatening me.  Sorry I won't fall for it.  Your arguments always boil down to: "If you don't do exactly as we tell you then we will let these terrorists chop your head off."</comment>

<comment>Huh?  I'm threatening you?  I'm I wearing a black mask, holding a knife and yelling, 'allahu Akbar!"</comment>

<comment>Yes and thanks for demonstrating the terrorism we've been subjected to for far too long.  Please, proceed:</comment>

<comment>oh, brother....</comment>

<comment>how do you know what they are?</comment>

<comment>True, just interrogate, release and utilize a predator drone..Done, case closed...</comment>

<comment>Is killing people for their religion that (allegedly) requires them to kill people for their religion hypocrisy?</comment>

<comment>Of course it is. There is a pervasive right wing supposition that opposition to the War on Terror as it's often been conducted, or recognition that interventionist US foreign policy has engendered hostility abroad, or belief that Muslim citizens, immigrants or refugees ought to be treated the same as any other citizens, immigrants or refugees, respectively, equal an endorsement of Islamic fundamentalism or terrorist activities. These boards are filled with comments about how liberals only care about protecting Muslim rapists, or how liberals think Islamic extremism is acceptable. Yet a comment like yours suggests that you actually buy that nonsense. ISIS is the scum of the earth. Iran is a nasty, brutal theocracy. Using religion to justify inhumanity is deplorable and hypocritical. No liberal I know would disagree with those sentiments. One can question US foreign policy or criticize foreign wars without excusing the conduct of the countries or groups with whom we are at war.</comment>

<comment>Our existence "engenders hostility"...Probably something to do with the fact we live in the 21st century while they are still struggling with the 7th...</comment>

<comment>Well, I was actually thinking about a bigger picture than the views of some Muslim extremists. Interventionist US foreign policy has a long and frustrating history in my mind, even putting aside our Middle Eastern adventures. Your comment actually illustrates my point. The US has interests in places other than the Islamic world, and opposition to an interventionist foreign could be based on any number of historical precedents that have nothing to do with our self-appointed role as the scourge of the world's Islamic extremists.</comment>

<comment>Back in the forties, people like you were arrested for collaborating with the enemy and shot.  PS  Gitmo exists because a bunch of a**holes like you are too chicken sh*t or too stupid to execute terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Human rights is a form of first world privilege, not a virtueIt's about time you folks realized this</comment>

<comment>Anti-American bigots like you take legitimate criticisms of militarism and extend them to a total denunciation that just discourages self-criticism.  The threadbare nonsense about "stealing" nations natural resources is a prime example.  You really show why your views qualify as hatred when not content to decry violence, you denounce sanctions ("pushing economic policies that starve whole nations").</comment>

<comment>Do you research on Osama Bin Laden.  He was our ally once, and one of the reasons why he formed a terrorist group and attacked the United States was sanctions against Iraq.  Do you know what the effects of those sanctions were?</comment>

<comment>I'm aware of the claims about those sanctions and Albright's morally obtuse comments. I have never seen convincing proof of the claims, which seem to fit the America the Guilty, can never do right, attitude of the Chomskyite left. How about you explain the way to compel nations if we can't sanction them and can't use force, even if wholly justified (since any use of force will inevitably cause loss of innocent life)?Bin Laden was our ally as part of Reagan's warperd proxy wars. He was a violent reactionary by then and should never have been considered an ally.  I'm not an apologist for American militarism, but i loath the anti-Americanism and Islamophilia of the left too. </comment>

<comment>Also he attacked us because of the whole Islamic supremacism meme. I'm not saying American policy is not contributory, but again, it is anti-American bigotry and Islam apologetics to ignore the history of jihad and its outburst of deliberate killing of random civlians around the world. </comment>

<comment>Actually, Bin Laden cited the deployment of US troops in Saudi Arabia during the 1991 Gulf War as a primary justification for his actions, not the sanctions against Iraq. He only mentioned the sanctions relatively briefly, with a slew of other 'grievances'.And let's not forget that those sanctions, as well as being endorsed by anti-war activists as an alternative to military action against Iraq, were also imposed by the United Nations Security Council due to Iraq's aggression and violation of ceasefire terms. The effects of those sanctions can be firmly placed at the feet of Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath government, and Boutros Ghali and Kofi Annan's UN administration, who delibaretely misappropriated aid intended to alleviate the humanitarian situation in Iraq.</comment>

<comment>"Allahu Akhbar!  As a soldier for the islamic state, you will have 72 virgins for eternity!""Naaa, not interested.  Hussein Obama has closed Guantanamo prison, praise Allah, and moved our brothers to mainland USA, so I'm going to live peacefully instead of lopping off people's heads and burning them alive."Who is naïve enough, or stupid enough, to believe this?</comment>

<comment>"Allahu Akhbar! As a soldier for the islamic state, you will have 72 virgins for eternity!" Who is naïve enough, or stupid enough, to believe this?</comment>

<comment>Everything that can be used as a recruiting tool is a recruiting tool.    The fact that American women don't cover themselves from head to toe is a recruiting tool.  So yea, Gitmo is a recruiting tool, but it's not like we had a bunch of Muslims detained at Gitmo and THEN 9/11 happened.  We have a bunch of Muslims detained at Gitmo BECAUSE 9/11 happened.The real question isn't whether Guantanamo is used as a recruiting tool, but whether or not it's a tool that's of any real use to America.  I don't believe it is a legitimate tool for the country.  It's simply a way for morally lazy leadership to detain people who they have no evidence against.Whether or not it is used by extremists as a bullet point in recruiting is mostly irrelevant.  The real reason to shut it down is because it's an unnecessary blight on America's collective conscience.</comment>

<comment>It has a location that makes it impossible to escape into the US from. I guess we could use Andersen AB in Guam.</comment>

<comment>All your arguments boil down to: "If you don't agree with me then we will unleash the terrorists on you."</comment>

<comment>??? Plenty of Cubans come to America. Some of them even grow up to run for President!</comment>

<comment>They dont have to escape a US prison and then a US Military base and then the Cuban Army, all obstacles Gitmo detainees would have to get past now!</comment>

<comment>If they've been there that long and haven't escaped...Hmmm, many Cubans have made it over the years.</comment>

<comment>I dont think the Rubio's started at Gitmo in detention</comment>

<comment>No they can't close it yet!  Wait til Trump is in power then he can have these bastards waterboarded so that we can get the details on the next terrorist plot and stop it just in time and confess the SB shooter's iPhone password so we can get his contacts and find out who might be 'at risk' of 'radicalization' and get them the help and treatment they need before it's too late.</comment>

<comment>They'll still be around, we can't let them go as more than half will go back to being Terrorists. They may be coming to a county jail near you, its a government job so it will go to the lowest bidder!</comment>

<comment>"go back to being Terrorists" - Well if they weren't extremist to begin with, this experience would certainly radicalize them.  Send them back to their home countries, let them handle it.  These 'terrorists' are more a danger to themselves and opposing religious factions than to us.  And we don't need to radicalize any more of them.  Time to close it down.</comment>

<comment>Whats left at Gitmo are the most notorious of all the prisoners we've ever put there. The ones we've released so far have a 25% recidivism rate, meaning they went back to active terrorism.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  Thank you for not threatening me with beheading.  That is progress.</comment>

<comment>I don't really care if they do go to county jail. Why do people act as if some guy picked up on the battlefield in Afghanistan and who has been incarcerated for 13 years is inevitably an Arab Lex Luthor who can (a) inevitably escape and (b) cause significant damage if he does? We successfully incarcerate mass murderers, sophisticated scam artists and all sorts of people far more potentially dangerous to society than most of these clowns. People need to get over the trope of the maniacal genius Muslim baddie who pulls strings across the globe. Osama bin Laden was as close to such a figure as we've seen over the years, and he appears to have spent the last several years of his life in hiding, having very little to do with the operations of his severely depleted terrorist network, and watching porn.</comment>

<comment>Assuming they've been in touch with terrorists the last decade, then they might - just might - have ambiguously actionable information. </comment>

<comment>OK and that is pretty much the definition of a witch hunt.</comment>

<comment>"ambiguously actionable information" is no information at all.</comment>

<comment>You are so hilarious!</comment>

<comment>The 2016 Republican Party:"In an Aug. 14 letter to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter, Roberts stressed that Kansas in general—and Leavenworth, in particular—are not ideal for a domestic detention facility. "Fort Leavenworth is neither the ideal nor right location for moving Guantánamo detainees," Roberts wrote to Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter. "The installation lies right on the Missouri River, providing terrorists with the possibility of covert travel underwater and attempting access to the detention facility."</comment>

<comment>"Travel underwater..."  All the way up from the mouth of the river??  Ludicrous and a crazy overactive imagination. </comment>

<comment>To answer the article's headline: no, probably not.</comment>

<comment>This has got to be the most ludicrous, contrived, artificial non-issue the Dems have concocted since Sen. George Allen was labeled a racist for saying "macaca" (?).The fact that Obama has actually ran with this nonsense simply makes him look like an even bigger ass than he already is.In the Middle East - normally, terrorist groups rarely even bother to take prisoners except to demand ransom or use them for propaganda ( or chop their heads off, like ISIS).The idea that some ordinary Muslim with no interest in jihad would suddenly become a jihadi out of shock and outrage that America imprisons terrorists in CUBA is absurd.Especially since the USA has no plans to stop imprisoning terrorists.If anything - they probably wonder why Americans don't just execute jihadists or demand millions in ransom, since that is their normal custom.</comment>

<comment>This blogger is a tool.  Rather telling that this piece has to draw on a israeli-first neocon 'think tank' to come up with the 'it is not useful to daesh propaganda' view.  Foundation for Defense of Democracies is regularly slated for alarmist rhetoric and fear-mongering and is regularly called upon by tom cotton among other neocons.The prison is a stain on American values, did not produce useful intel and continues to be used by terrorists as a recruiting and propaganda tool.  Yes, trump and his moronic blathering is also a tool, but he'll be shut down at some point as well.  Keep the base, close the prison.</comment>

<comment>As soon as Obama released his plan to close the prison, Republicans jumped in to oppose it (naturally.) What was their opposition based on? For many it seemed to be that same old lurid fantasy of a carefully orchestrated, horribly violent Al Qaeda prison break on American soil--as though that or any other terrorist organization has the skill, logistics, wherewithal, and sheer numbers of capable operatives to break a few of their old buddies out of a Supermax prison in the heartland of America and then vanish to fight again.But in all of their protestations about "security" and "the safety of Americans," a few of them let slip the real reason why they won't support a closure/transfer: they don't want to help Obama fulfill one last campaign promise before he leaves office. In other words, it's the same old obstructionist crap they've been pulling since before the man even took office.</comment>

<comment>It is a bit ironic that Obama claims we need to close Gitmo because it's a terrorist recruiting tool, but at the same time he created the best terrorist recruitment tool ever by allowing ISIS to grab half of Iraq and Syria.</comment>

<comment>You forgot to mention Libya.</comment>

<comment>"too dangerous to try" - what?  That's ridiculous.  No evidence is more likely. And as far as being in Cuba, wtf?  There is absolutely NO reason they couldn't do their time in a Supermax SHU.</comment>

<comment>The propaganda tool argument was always weak.  The strongest case for closing GItmo remains that of being contrary to values espoused in the constitution and its application even to alleged foreign terrorists.  Of course, on that issue there is a big divide in our body politic.</comment>

<comment>It is part of the administration's "countering violent extremism" initiative.  PR is PR is BS.</comment>

<comment>The exact opposite is trueThe constitution is just a piece of paper, that argument is by far the weakest</comment>

<comment>What a bunch of nonsense. The US constitution, like all constitutions, reflects the organizing principles of its particular government and lays out that government's relationship to the people at whose pleasure the government exists. Which explains how the British can have a constitution that isn't on any piece of paper.</comment>

<comment>Agree, except one thing. The way Obama talks about it, hell, I am tempted to join ISIS!  Obama is the one who makes it a recruiting tool. If he'd shut the hell up about it already no one would care. </comment>

<comment>Obama is an ISIS recruitment TOOL</comment>

<comment>You are a broken tool.</comment>

<comment>"...then-candidate Obama campaigned against what he portrayed as the excesses of the Bush administration in its zeal to fight terrorism, including the harsh interrogation techniques and indefinite detentions that Guantanamo came to symbolize"The author is a coward, falling in with the "We are Americans, We don't torture. So let's do it but call it something else" crowd.No. Words matter, and actions matter. It WAS torture. It IS torture. Stop being a coward.</comment>

<comment>So will Republicans stop preventing Obama from closing gitmo?Not bloody likely.</comment>

<comment>no reason to</comment>

<comment>NoThe fact that we house the POW's in Cuba as opposed to somewhere else makes no difference on recruiting.  That is purely internal politics</comment>

<comment>Stalag Gitmo.</comment>

<comment>We pay Cuba a dollar a year rent for Guantanamo Bay.It is a highly strategic arsenal for the US with Cuba right there and Russia not too far off as the world saw during the JFK administration with the USSR floating right in with their missiles to aim at us.Obama must really think he's dunced us pretty much so we don't know that the prisoners he hasn't released surreptitiously, and that're fighting us once again, will have to go somewhere....guess where!It is worrisome that he expects them to be Mirandized but it's the whole idea of bringing terrorist in, a shivery reminder of 9/11 terrorists that we unknowingly allowed in.Obama apparently doesn't know either that we do know it takes both sides to nullify the agreement, and Cuba's been awfully quiet.It is so difficult to read that Obama actually has those who approve of his performing like every foreign country's show dog.</comment>

<comment>Barry Hussein is a pretty good recruitment tool.  He done got hisself in a proxy war against hisself. The U.S. backed Kurds retaking ground against the U.S. backed Syrian rebels. Ahh! you gotta love affirmative action!Kindest Regards</comment>

<comment>Gitmo has about as much to do with recruiting terrorists as a apple has with a car.  NADA.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...I never thought of that. Gee...let's let them go and they'll stop killing us. That's it! Why didn't we think of that, before. Thanks, Obama. You're so doggone smart. You did it again.</comment>

<comment>When Obama's lips move, I turn off the audio.  This is the same Obama that told America that 'you can keep your healthcare plan'.</comment>

<comment>Obama has been really successful getting people to fight about Gitmo when in reality, people just want really bad people to be locked up and kept away from them and their families.  Does any really care where we keep really bad people.  I understand why people don't want even really bad people mistreated, I'm one of them,  but the location of the prison.....who cares.   Their seems to be a pretty good argument for the place so back the F*** off Mr. P.  You're being a dick!</comment>

<comment>Are the guys in the photo taking a group bathroom break?</comment>

<comment>I think that their book is their primary recruiting tool.</comment>

<comment>Gitmo or no Gitmo, the Jihad will continue against the US as we are truly hated.</comment>

<comment>all thanks to Obama</comment>

<comment>All thanks to the US blind support of the terrorists that created Israel in the 1940's and the continued US support of their brutality ever since. Where in heck do you think these barbarians get their motivation from? Yeah, the world was all boohoohoo over what the sick Nazi's did during WWII. I'll grant you that. But to support the utter brutality that the right-wing nut jobs have perpetrated on the region since 1948 is utter lunacy. There were more than TWICE as many UN sanctions against Israel than against Saddam Hussein during Saddam's tenure. And Saddam was the bad guy? When Israel begins to atone for their OWN atrocities, including, but not limited to, throwing Hellfire missiles into civilian apartment buildings to get one "suspect", maybe the region will have a chance to calm down.</comment>

<comment>I think the barbarism of Islam itself is the recruiting tool.</comment>

<comment>I believe it's a factor, but then you'd expect Indonesia to be among the world centers of terrorism, but it isn't.  There are other factors at play and if you know your history, you'll realise that the US has been a huge enabler as well as a rationale for Islamic terrorism.</comment>

<comment>The prison, Obama said, “undermines our standing in the world. It is viewed as a stain on our broader record of upholding the highest standards of rule of law.”No need to worry about that record; with your capital punishment, your huge rates of imprisonment of blacks, your drone strikes and your continued interference in other countries, we weren't even sure if you believed in the concept of law.  </comment>

<comment>Are Republicans ready to take responsibility for keeping gitmo open and obstructing Obama at every turn?No, of course not. When have Republicans, those "personal responsibility "patriots"" ever taken responsibility for their actions?</comment>

<comment>yes ... someone had to do it ... it was the patriotic thing to do</comment>

<comment>Nice that that spandex American flag can stretch to cover your morbidly obese body.No. It wasn't the "patriotic" thing to do. It was the contrarian idiot thing to do, which Republicans are masters of.</comment>

<comment>If KSM and other prized detainees from Guantánamo are transferred to Supermax jail in Colorado, then does that become a recruiting magnate or jihadists worldwide? Liberals are so screwed in west if the jihadist war heats up a little bit more.</comment>

<comment>Congress wouldn't allow it.  Their response was to pass another de-funding bill (they love to use coercion against the Prez.  They make sure he has to pass their poison pills.so there was no way to implement a return to judicial process for anyone there.</comment>

<comment>This article should be taken with a large grain of Kosher salt, as it cites the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, (FDD), is a right-wing, neocon think tank, founded by Clifford May, a notorious neocon and de facto Israeli agent.  The FDD is an Israel-first organization. These are some of the creepy people who helped to take the US to war in Iraq using falsehoods, half-truths and outright lies.From Wiki:The International Relations Center features a report on the foundation [the FDD] on its "Right Web" website, a program of the left-wing[23][24][25][26][27] think tank Institute for Policy Studies[28] which, according to its mission statement, seeks to "check the militaristic drift of the country". The report states that "although the FDD is an ardent critic of terrorism, it has not criticized actions taken by Israel against Palestinians that arguably fall into this category".[29] It terms the FDD a "prominent member of the web of neoconservative-aligned think tanks", including the American Enterprise Institute, the Hudson Institute and Freedom House.[30] (end Wiki quote)The Israelis see no problem with incarcerating Muslims for years without charges, so the FDD is not a big fan of closing down Gitmo.  The Atlantic editorial staff seems to have adopted Israeli values.</comment>

<comment>It is long overdue that you stop worrying about what they think.  Time for them to worry about what we think.  This is a holding pen for scumbags. You are either a scumbag or not. Of course use all resources necessary to determine if they are a scumbag and deserve to be there. that’s it. Done.</comment>

<comment>Most of the detainees were in the wrong place at the wrong time... in many cases, they were rounded up by other terrorists who then turned them over to US authorities.Bush & Cheney thought that sending these unfortunate bastards to a military base in Cuba would piss off the Cuban government, while placating the neocons at home and abroad.Bush & Cheney should be undergoing waterboarding at Gitmo... they would confess to everything.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense</comment>

<comment>Whatever.</comment>

<comment>No, the problem with Guantanamo is not the impression it gives to potential terrorists, it's the poison in US relationships with other state governments and populations. The American concept of extra-judicial detainment, along with extraordinary rendition and acceptable torture, ensures that the US has little or no moral authority over other nations in the eyes of much of the world. Elect someone like Trump and leaders like Putin will seem like a desirable counterbalance to a lot more of the world's population.</comment>

<comment>The US federal government has adopted Israeli values: extrajudicial killings, extraordinary rendition, extended detention without being charged, racial/religious profiling, police entrapment schemes and so on.Israel and the USA are probably the most hated nations on the planet right now.  Sleep with dogs and you get fleas.</comment>

<comment>WERE THIS ARGUMENT BE TRUE THEN SHOULD WE CLOSE ALL THE PRISONS AND JAILS IN THE US? SINCE SO MANY OF THE HOME TERRORISTS WERE RECRUITED IN THEM?  CRAP IDEA FROM A CRAP INEPT PRES---</comment>

<comment>It's generally conceded that interning IRA terrorists without trial (whom in virtually all cases were much guiltier than most in Gitmo) was a mistake and acted as a recruiting sergeant for the provos so why would doing the same in Gitmo not have the same impact?  And remind me again which country was front and centre in objecting to such internment?  It seems to me completely plausible that if you've been picked up because one of your business rivals shops you to the CIA and you end up locked up for years, tortured and then not given any opportunity to see the "evidence" against you, you might want to get some of your own back.</comment>
