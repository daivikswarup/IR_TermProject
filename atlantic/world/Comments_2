<comment>Brought to you by the Obama administration and their open support of the radical Sunni "arab spring".</comment>

<comment>The "Arab Spring" was not a movement inspired or directed primarily by radical Sunnis. It was mostly initiated by Westernized Egyptian youth. And then the Muslim Brotherhood took the opportunity to hop on board and turn it to their own purposes. This was one of those situations where an American president can't win, given the ground rules. The ground rules being that whatever happens in a country the size and strategic importance of Egypt, the USA must be the single country in the world responsible for what ultimately happens there. Especially the US president. Given the circumstances.In this case, the US president had two basic choices at the outset: 1) continue to prop up a corrupt despot in the face of a massive popular revolt, which would look even worse than an American endorsement of the Tianamen Square massacre, and have much more extensive and long-lasting negative repercussions in the Arab world; or 2) providing cheery homilies about democracy blooming on the banks of the Nile and maintaining studied neutrality about the outcome, all the while realizing that the whole shebang was bound to be hijacked from the kids in short order by the most militant and organized opposition faction, the MB.Realpolitik trump card: the US has a decades-long legacy of serious pull with top echelon of the Egyptian military, from the inside. We equip the Egyptian armed forces, train their pilots and officers, go on joint maneuvers with them, probably pay some of them off, and may even have sincerely persuaded others to share American foreign policy priorities. As an institution, they're in our corner. Up to a point. So far, anyway.You will notice that the "radical Sunni" Muslim Brotherhood no longer runs Egypt. The Egyptian military does. Although with what assurance of stability and security in this day and age, I honestly don't know.(And yes, "radical Sunni" is an accurate description of the MB. They're only "moderate" in comparison to Daesh.)Realpolitik is so cheesy sometimes. I wish there was a more imaginative version of it.Demographic note: in 2010, 50% of the Egyptian population was under the age of 24. In neighboring countries, the median age is even younger. The Arab world 21st Century Baby Boom is coming of age. The Arab Spring kids were trying to have their Sixties. But all too many of their elders keep wanting to turn them into a Muslim version of the Red Guards.A heretical diplomat, were there one present, would not prescribe a conventional military solution to the threat of fanatical groupthink and armed militancy. They would, perhaps, propose a carefully crafted and targeted psychedelic solution instead. In conjunction with the cessation of all lethal warfare tactics, at least for for the duration of the experiment.</comment>

<comment>Nice job, USA and France. Looks like taking out Gaddafi was about as good of an idea as taking out Saddam Hussein. You reap what you sow, so enjoy the endless wars overseas, American taxpayers.</comment>

<comment>And Mubarak in Egypt, and Assad in Syria.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, el-Sisi seems to have things under control in Egypt, and the war in Syria has seen a turning point late last year with increased Russian and Kurdish involvement.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. Luckily the citizens of Egypt resisted against the Muslim Brotherhood doing what they do, which led to a swift end to Morsi's regime</comment>

<comment>And Yemen. You don't hear much about it, but here's the current map of the war there: https://upload.wikimedia.org/w...White is Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.</comment>

<comment>Yemen is actually Saudi Arabia and Iran.</comment>

<comment>yes, I always forget about Yemen bc KSA is fighting on behalf of the besieged government there, probably committing lots of war crimes</comment>

<comment>Worse, really. At least in Iraq people knew that we'd have to get our hands dirty to fix it, even if they did massively underestimate how hard that would be. In Libya they somehow thought we wouldn't need to do nation-building because it would happen spontaneouslyStep one: Drop bombs on the place Step two: Go home and ignore the placeStep three:????Step four: DEMOCRACY!</comment>

<comment>Step five: A return engagement-in-force</comment>

<comment>Overseas? They do look good in TV.</comment>

<comment>So, how will you all blame this on Bush? This is 100% Obama and his blanket support of the radical Sunni "arab spring."</comment>

<comment>Uh, ISIS came out of a broken Iraq.  Which was broken long before Obama came to the White House.Oh, who was President around that time?</comment>

<comment>People like yourself waste vast amounts of time assigning blame rather than working towards solutions to the problems at hand. The solution is both obvious and simple - kill the enemy and be done with it. Your guilt will pass with time.</comment>

<comment>I have to say I completely agree with the what's the point in placing blame game.It doesn't matter who did what when. That stuff can all be worked out after a solution to a problem is found. Getting sidetracked on the blame game doesn't lead to a solution.See also: But (that guy you like) did it too! What about that? Huh? Huh?</comment>

<comment>Gaddafi wouldn't have allowed ISIS to exist in Libya, except someone bombed his forces and now that nation is destabilized just like Iraq and Afghanistan and Egypt.</comment>

<comment>Uh, yep.</comment>

<comment>Actually, when Obama withdrew US forces from Iraq, he described Iraq as stable. "But we’re leaving behind a sovereign, stable and self-reliant Iraq, with a representative government that was elected by its people."- Barack of Arabia (2011)</comment>

<comment>Iraq still has a functioning government, they are exporting record amounts of oil. What's the problem?</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should ask Nari224.</comment>

<comment>well, except for that time when they almost taken over by ISIS and the US had to GO BACK IN.</comment>

<comment>The US never left, really. What naive people like you are complaining about is the absence of a permanent US military base in Iraq. News flash: the national government of Iraq did not want one. It still doesn't want one. It's their decision to make. It has always been their decision to make. All a US president can do is ask- although I'll note that as a rule, it's the host country that requests that a US armed forces contingent remain on their territory, not the other way around. But we weren't invited in the first place, were we?The current Iraqi government has always been fine with a US military presence in their country- on their terms: some trainers and SOF who operate inside Iraqi borders at the behest of the government, and who will leave promptly when they're no longer welcome. And, oh yeah, some tens of billions in military aid, as provided with the encouragement of the president and Congressional committee leadership, and granted with the assent of the US Congress. The bulk of of which was already in the pipeline when Barack Obama was inaugurated, if it hadn't already been spent. Obama did request some additional military aid, once in office. But the big-ticket items have been in negotiation for a long time. From the Wall Street Journal, 9/05/2008:Yeah. Funny. Mordantly.What's that really all about, anyway? US national security, Iraqi national security- or the fortunes of the Lockheed Martin Corporation?Granted, the Iraqis have evidently recently been using some of those F-16s for airstrikes against Daesh convoys and other targets. But simply in terms of the practicalities of conventional warfare, I have to wonder if, say, B-26 Marauders might not work at least as effectively for that purpose. (And I haven't been able to turn up anything about the Iraqis being permitted to buy A-10 Warthogs. For some reason.) </comment>

<comment>At the time Obama said that, it was an accurate statement, within carefully circumscribed limits. I think he was putting the best face on a situation that he knew full well he had no power to affect in any meaningful fashion. Because the government of Iraq was nothing if not sovereign. The US had no leverage over them at all- hadn't had any since 2005, when the provisional government was replaced by a national government newly chartered with its own constitution.Daesh was only active in Syria at the time when Obama made that statement. But I'll allow that Obama probably knew that Iraq was a little wobbly at that point. And he also probably knew why- the inability of the Maliki-led Shi'ite coalition and the Sunnis to get along with each other. What was the US supposed to do about that problem? Solve it for the Iraqis?</comment>

<comment>I don't believe we had any business in Iraq in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Then why are you blaming Obama for not trying to force the Iraqis to accept a US base on their territory? Such an attempt would have been doomed to futility, unless we fomented a coup and installed a new Iraqi government with a US puppet as leader. Even then, actually.Obama did ask, after all. And then outlets like the National Review peddled the ludicrous notion that the Iraqis would have agreed, if only Obama had offered more troops. If the Iraqi government had wanted a larger garrison of US troops, they would have asked for one. They had already refused more troops.. The Maliki administration had already negotiated a total withdrawal of US troops, which Bush had signed in December 2008.</comment>

<comment>Where did I blame anyone for anything?Where did I advocate Obama using force in Iraq for anything?</comment>

<comment>I was confusing your remarks with those of "Voice of Reason", who wrote the comment to which I initially replied. And then you replied to me.I don't mind you adding your comment. But you have to admit, your screen names are similar. Hence the confusion. </comment>

<comment>Where was I 'interposing?'</comment>

<comment>Since you apparently find that term objectionable, I'm correcting it to "adding".</comment>

<comment>That's what you do on comment boards, no.</comment>

<comment>ISIS didn't really even exist during Bush.  And it didn't declare a caliphate until several years AFTER Obama abandoned Iraq.Obama OWNS ISIS, and Libya.Bush made a mistake invading Iraq in 2003.  Then he sorta fixed it with the Gates/Petraeus surge.  Obama made the much more recent mistakes of abandoning Iraq in 2010 and overthrowing Ghaddafi in 2011.</comment>

<comment>Obama did not "abandon" Iraq. It wasn't the USA's to abandon.The Iraqi government did not want a US base on the ground there, full stop. It was their decision to make. The Shi'ite regime running the country are short-sighted idiots indulging in the zero-sum politics of payback, which is a recipe for protracted misery. But it's their country. They live there, and I don't. And neither do any of the American jingoists implicitly demanding that Obama should have tried to run Iraq as a satrapy, or something. What could they- you- possibly be thinking?By the way- "the surge" only worked in Anbar province (Sunni). The US government was paying approximately 100% of the bills for the provincial government there, c.2007. The Shi'ite national government didn't want to give the Sunnis of Anbar any aid, and they didn't give them any aid after the US left, either http://www.meforum.org/2788/so... With predictable results. Meanwhile, all through 2008, East Baghdad was owned by the Mahdi Army and the Sadrists (Shi'ite). The Baghdad police force was basically Mahdi Army. The "coalition"/US forces never, ever pacified East Baghdad. The "Shi'ite militias" that fought US troops there in 2008 were basically the military auxiliary of the political coalition running the national government of Iraq. They still are. http://www.amazon.com/The-Good...http://www.amazon.com/The-Occu...I bet you didn't know that. You have to read books to find out facts like those, instead of being spoon-fed by American television. That history goes a long way toward explaining why George W. Bush agreed to a total and complete withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in December 2008.Libya was definitely a failure by Obama and Hillary, who refused to learn from the recurrent follies of ordering US military power halfway around the world to intervene in the internal affairs of another nation (particularly in places where they weren't invited by the duly constituted government.) Although my impression is that it's more due to inertia than their own personal inspiration- there's a pre-existing Beltway Permanent Government consensus "wisdom" on the desirability of US military "global power projection" that they feel compelled to share. (Speaking of which, Marco Rubio seems to be running for MIC Protege #1 on that score; he has the spiel down to, uh, bullet points.)</comment>

<comment>that's the dumbest thing anyone has ever said.  full stop.  and obama apologists keep repeating it like some sort of magic charm to ward off criticsm of the incredibly reckless decision obama made.  if hitler had his way, we wouldn't have invaded germany and occupied it for 50 years.BTW, you may not have "read this in a book", but Petreaus was successful in getting Maliki to start to go after Shia militias in Basra and Sadr city.No ine is claiming that Iraq didn't still have enormous challenges after the surge, but at that point ISIS didn't exist and the entire mideast and north africa wasn't collapsing.</comment>

<comment>Bringing up the fact that the duly constituted governments of sovereign nations have the final say on whether or not to permit a garrison of foreign troops on their territory is "the dumbest thing anyone has ever said"?" Petreaus was successful in getting Maliki to start to go after Shia militias in Basra and Sadr city."Read The Good Soldiers. All the way through. You owe it to the American troops who were ordered to do the impossible. And then read The Occupation of Iraq. Between those two books, you should realize what a fraudulent hype that claim is. And having checked it,  hopefully you'll know better than to repeat it.Maliki didn't really run Iraq. He was a front man, the public face of the ruling Shi'ite coalition. He was the close ally of Moqtada al-Sadr, who retains the real power in the country in some crucial respects.  The Sadrists turned the heat on American troops up and down until their point was made.Moqtada is still probably the most powerful man in Iraq, although he has the tactical sense to keep a low profile internationally. He'd never run for president of Iraq, for instance. He doesn't have to. He's the only person in Iraq who can call a rally and get a response like this http://news.yahoo.com/tens-tho... There are a couple of real laugh lines in that story, if you notice all the little details.Here's Moqtada's Wiki bio. You'll find that he has what the Chinese refer to as guanxi. A whole lot of guanxi. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/..."at that point ISIS didn't exist and the entire mideast and north africa wasn't collapsing."When you swing a wrecking ball, some structures collapse faster than others. Sometimes walls stay up for a little while before they crumble. And when it's done as recklessly as Bush did it, in a crowded neighborhood, sometimes they collapse outward. Although if you read through an array of PNAC "think pieces" c.1998-2002, it's tough not to get the idea that this was exactly what they had in mind. </comment>

<comment>yes, it's the dumbest thing ever written.  Well except for Phase V of the invasion plan, maybe.  The SOFA argument is a lame excuse to cut and run.  For God's sake, even Panetta said Obama could have negotiated a new SOFA if he had wanted to try.you can find a book on the topic of Iraq that meets any agenda you want.  So what.  I'll take Petreaus's word and Panetta's word and Bob Gates' word on the topic.</comment>

<comment>That's the only thing you have to lean on- the Beltway War Party Establishment's claim, which is baseless on its face. Although in order to realize its inherent risibility you have to consider it like a thinking person, instead of acting like a chicken pecking at a bread crumb trail. Something most US news media employees have yet to learn, based on their uncritical repeating of it. That isn't reporting, that's stenography.The declining of the SOFA was the most polite way that the Iraqi government could find to tell the US government to GTFO. If you don't know how to read between the lines when they delineate something that obvious, I can't help you. It should also be noted that if anyone has valid grounds for declining a SOFA with the US, it's the Iraqis."you can find a book on the topic of Iraq that meets any agenda you want. So what." Some of them are a lot more accurate and informative than others. That's what. You're simply arguing on behalf of maintaining your own ignorance. </comment>

<comment>One of your Expert Witnesses, David Petraeus, puts in an appearance in one of the books I recommended- The Good Soldiers, by David Finkel. Petraeus spent part of an afternoon at the US Army outpost in East Baghdad that's featured in the book. David Finkel spent eight months there. Here's the excerpt where Petraeus shows up: http://www.washingtonpost.com/... Go on, read it.</comment>

<comment>Not 100% Obama- also Hillary as Secretary of State.</comment>

<comment>Libyan intervention cost a thrifty $2 billion dollars, that is value for money.</comment>

<comment>With those kind of savings we could go around overthrowing leaders of dozens of countries.This is fun...Where to next?</comment>

<comment>They should have had you as the NASA spokesman when the space shuttle exploded.</comment>

<comment>Probably 80% Hillary, 20% Obama.  A big part of his failure is that he basically gave her free reign.</comment>

<comment>Samantha Power and Susan Rice threw down with Hillary as well.</comment>

<comment>Very true.  There should be something in the "diplomacy" instruction manual that says, "If the Joint Chiefs are being forced to go around the SoS to press for a peaceful resolution, you are doing it wrong."</comment>

<comment>I'd like to simply write Hillary off as a sociopath, but how cruel would that be to other self-adoring sociopaths?</comment>

<comment>Maybe we should occupy the entire middle east, forever, and then it will be peaceful.  Right?</comment>

<comment>Is ISIS in Libya or is "ISIS" in Libya? Is there a funding and training connection between the Islamic State in Iraq/Syria and affiliates or are local militant groups watching ISIS videos and deciding to call themselves ISIS? Some small group thinking the name is cool is a lot different than fighters coming out of Iraq to spread war.</comment>

<comment>No, there are significant organizational links. There are even some signs that as the pressure rises in Syria, ISIS Central is shifting focus to Libya.</comment>

<comment>IBTBiggest ISIS Threat To Europe Now Comes From Libya, Not Syria And IraqBY ALESSANDRIA MASI 02/21/16 AT 1:00 PM'The U.S. decision to strike ISIS targets in Libya, which [the Pentagon described as a matter of national security], underscores the extent of the militant group’s expansion in terms of both members and territory during the past six months.ISIS in Libya — basically southern Europe’s backyard — is proving to be a bigger threat than the group’s branches in Iraq and Syria. The North African country has become a hub for European foreign fighters who are either unable or unwilling to travel to Iraq or Syria and who, on returning to their European homes, plan further atrocities.' (excerpt)http://www.ibtimes.com/biggest...LIbya, the fruit of enlightened intervention...Smart Power.</comment>

<comment>ISIS is a tool used by Saudia Arabia and Russia to provoke Western attacks on oil fields in Iraq and Libya to staunch freefalling gas prices.  And to create a flood of refugees into Europe.  There is no point in bombing them as there is an endless supply of uneducated country yokels to fill their ranks.  Let them fight it out among themselves.  If there is a faction in Libya that embraces freedom of religion and human rights then we should support them.  Otherwise, stay out of it.</comment>

<comment>That's one of the more crazy conspiracy theories.</comment>

<comment>Brainwashed fundamentalists can hold useful college degrees just as well as they can be yokels.It's a little more complicated than "stay out of it." If the pretenses were dropped, then ISIS would become a legitimate puppet state. There's no particular reason that they can't govern. Left to their own devices, they'd probably not kill each other any more than the Saudis do.Saudi Arabia and Russia are both taking foreign adventures to hide domestic weakness behind nationalist machismo. Might it be worthwhile to avoid letting them grab (and profit from) imperial possessions?</comment>

<comment>You seem a bit conflicted.  I guess that's progress.  Anyway like I said, stay out of it.  They are big boys they can take care of themselves.</comment>

<comment>Oil prices are freefalling because China slowed down and OPEC flooded the market to make recovering oil sands and fracking more expensive than they're worth.If the Saudis want to drive the price back up all they have to do is shutdown the refineries. No reason to blow them up.</comment>

<comment>Hopefully the Republican candidates will use this against HRC on the campaign trail.</comment>

<comment>Good call, Spud.And you'll conveniently ignore the fact that Congress hasn't even debated military action on ISIS, much less acted to fund it.Which president has taken an active role in fighting ISIS?  Obama.And for extra fun, he finished the job with Al Qaeda, something conservatives didn't have the sack to do.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - small problem for you guys - the Obama/Clinton administration made the call to take out the Libyan government with no plan for the next day.You would think that they might have learned something from Iraq.Oh, and that little matter of Obama's post-golfing speech about "degrading and destroying ISIS" - what is that ..uhhh..almost two years ago now?This Libyan doubling thing coupled with the stalemate in Iraq and Syria kind of makes him look like an ineffective blowhard, right?</comment>

<comment>Call me when the moment comes that ISIS can manage to kill more Americans in a year than you can count on your little digits.Until that time comes, there is no comparison.</comment>

<comment>The threat ISIS poses isn't killing lots of Americans by raw number, it's destabilizing governments that otherwise might have been able to maintain the rule of law over millions and millions of people.I don't have a political point to make here; personally, I think it's kind of pointless to assign blame for incredibly complex international crises to individuals.  But ISIS really is a threat to human progress, even if the particular humans in question aren't American.  Likewise, it's not clear that the steps the world has taken against them have accomplished much in terms of long-term gains.  Like the Taliban, all they have to do to "win" is not lose.  If we physically force them out of Syria, things will repeat themselves in Africa, and maybe even if we don't.  In any event, the threat they pose has nothing to do with how many Americans they can get their hands on, that part is just for show.</comment>

<comment>Libya was already teetering. The US, UN, NATO, and other Arab states merely tipped the balance. Gadaffi was clearly crazy enough to attack his own people. He would've been another Assad."No plan for the next day"… you mean an occupation? Thanks, but I'll take the status quo. The issues presented in this article are just nitpicking; Libya today is as good as it could possibly be.</comment>

<comment>Odd.President Obama considers the result of his most excellent adventure in Libya to be the greatest foreign policy 'regret' of his administration.Since Qaddafi's overthrow, 500,000 internally displaced Libyans and 1,600,000 Libyans dependent on some form of foreign assistance.Good as it gets!</comment>

<comment>Sucks to be them. But that's the damage Gaddafi did, and it's the ultimate fate of every single petro-state. You can't expect folks to suddenly learn how to work. When one teat dries up, they'll seek another.Can you imagine some realistic alternative? Obama's "woulda coulda" attitude is unsurprising, but isn't that a pipe dream too?Hammering Libya with missiles for a few days to take out their jets and artillery isn't an "excellent adventure." Its an application of policy and fairly obvious strategy. ISIS (and other braindead god-bots) will find endless recruits one way or another, but at least they can be denied materiel.</comment>

<comment>Please explain the 'obvious strategy.'</comment>

<comment>What did Assad do with similar jets, missiles, and artillery? Whose interests are served by letting such things exist in such a place at all?Libya can have new toys when some arms exporter deems some future government worthy.</comment>

<comment>What about Nigeria and Boko Haram?What about Lil' Kim's threat to nuke the US?What about the brutal repression of 'Arab Spring' dissidents in Bahrain by the combined military intervention of the UAE and the KSA?What about the ongoing slaughter in S Sudan?Qaddafi was most certainly less of a threat to US interests than was Saddam Hussein.What was the immediate threat to US interests?Why did the US refuse to negotiate a cease fire in Libya, much as they have in Syria?Why Libya?And why was there no exit strategy?Hillary defends the decision to overthrow Qaddafi as  the intelligent use of "smart power."How 'smart' was it?Even Obama regrets both the lack of foresight and the ensuing humanitarian disaster in Libya.What happened to war as a last resort?</comment>

<comment>Libya had a more considerable military than those other places, and it was already an isolated pariah unlike e.g. Bahrain. The US didn't start the war. There was a short operation which consisted mainly of destroying heavy weaponry. That's not an invasion and it doesn't require an "exit strategy."Obama is a regretful person. Who cares how he feels? Hillary uses stupid terms like "smart power" for everything she does. So what? Your argumentation seems limited to feelings, rhetoric, and the lazy false equivalence of "what about"-ism.</comment>

<comment>The US participated in the overthrow of Qaddafi.The results of that intervention are apparent.The AtlanticOct 2015"Hillary Defends Her Failed War in Libya"CONOR FRIEDERSDORFFew even noticed the weakest moment in the Democratic frontrunner’s debate.'Using contested intelligence, a powerful adviser urges a president to wage a war of choice against a dictator; makes a bellicose joke when he is killed; declares the operation a success; fails to plan for a power vacuum; and watches Islamists gain power.That describes Dick Cheney and the Iraq War—and Hillary Clinton and the war in Libya.'http://www.theatlantic.com/pol...If the PRC destroyed all US military assets and severely damaged the infrastructure in California over a seven month period using air and sea launched precision guided munitions you would characterize that as what...A diplomatic initiative? lol'Sucks to be them.'

<comment>Coup-by-Air"Winning!"- C Sheen</comment>

<comment>>Libya today is as good as it could possibly be.I don't believe that for a second.  We did far more to oust Qaddafi in terms of kinetic operations than we did Assad, and Qaddafi was likely stronger to begin with and in a better position with his fellow leaders in the area.  Without our strikes on his communications and infrastructure he likely would have crushed the rebellion, it was looking that way for a while until we stepped up our intervention.  A lot of people would have died, but Libya would still exist as a country.  At this point, it no longer does.</comment>

<comment>Congress wasn't invited into the discussion of Obama's most excellent adventure in Libya. (It was in all the papers)Libya is now the second most popular jihad destination in the world.And AQ is alive and well. (See Yemen)</comment>

<comment>Putin is a two bit dictator,  but Russians are a simple people that can't handle freedom. </comment>

<comment>"The analogy we use around here sometimes, and I think is accurate, is if a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant." - Barack of Arabia</comment>

<comment>"American military adventurism relies on a very backward notion of causation. When evil men in the world kill their own people, somehow America is to blame for not stopping them.When American action leads directly to disorder, barbarism, and terror, well, that's someone else's fault. It's our unspoken doctrine of humanitarian anarchy."- Michael Brendan Dougherty, The Week</comment>

<comment>If anything, this shows that Russian involvement in Syria is working, as IS aren't very good on the battlefield against opponents with modern aircover (until it becomes a war between Turkey and Russia).  The problem is that Libya really needs a stable government and none of the power groups there are strong enough to take-over or are interested in ending the de facto civil war.</comment>

<comment>So, Ghaddafi gave up his WMD and his reward from the Obama administration was to be raped with knives by islamists until he died.that's probably not a good way to garner future cooperation with regimes to give up their WMD.</comment>

<comment>Bush made a mistake invading Iraq in 2003.  Then he sorta fixed it with the Gates/Petraeus surge.  Obama made the much more recent mistakes of abandoning Iraq in 2010, setting "red lines" he didn't intend to keep in Syria, and overthrowing Ghaddafi in 2011.So now we have more refugees than anytime since WWII and ISIS and other terror groups have metastasized into defacto states.  Putin has gone all-in to preserve his client in Syria and upset the balance of power between Shia and Sunni.  Even though Putin's options are far weaker than the US's, he has played them expertly.  Meanwhile, the US president admitted a year or two ago that he "doesn't have a Syria strategy".It's disgraceful.  Never has a country had so much tactical excellence at the "tip of the spear" and so much strategic incompetence through 2 administrations.</comment>

<comment>Somebody below claimed that the Obama administration "finished" Al Qaeda.  That's a lie.Al Qaeda is still around, and more widespread than ever.  They are just getting outshone by ISIS.  See, for example, the HuffPo article on "is al Qaeda in decline".</comment>
