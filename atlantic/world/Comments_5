<comment>I'm not sure what the problem is here. These people are migrants, illegal migrants at that. They chose to willingly leave their home country, and trek to France, and now trying to trek to the UK. No one made them pass by Turkey, or other ME countries, or even Germany, etc. They chose to come this far. So I dont have a whole lot of sympathy for them living in slum-shantytowns, when its a choice they made and continue to make. They are free to go back home if where they are in France is so awful. Every time I read these stories, I can't help but wonder why they feel so entitled to things when they made their own mess, and continue to mire in it every day.Go home, fight for your country, put it back in order. Go home, live with the country as it is. Or if you insist on illegally traveling into the EU in search of a safe space (BS, btw, given how many safe countries there are between the ME and UK), then you can darn well deal with whatever conditions you find available. You are not entitled to anything in our countries, the same that mass numbers of people in your countries wouldn't be entitled to anything. You can either shut up and take what you are given, or you can leave. Enough with the demands for more more more more. You left. You chose to walk by plenty of other countries that you'd fit in better with, to go where you are decidedly NOT welcome. And then you complain about it? You made your bed, now lie in it</comment>

<comment>Yes we do owe them, since western imperialism is what wrecked their countries in the first place. Besides, there is nothing wrong with making Europe and the UK more multicultural and diverse.</comment>

<comment>Oh dear lord, do you self-flagellating cucks ever give it a rest?So the common man should have to suffer because of the decisions of the elite and the corporations who lobbied for these wars?</comment>

<comment>And its far easier for folks to blame the West for all the problems of the ME, rather than acknowledging and accepting that these people have been at each others throats for millenia, and will continue to do so. Sure, the West didn't help anything, but to act like this isn't mostly about people who hate the very essence of one another, and have lived in periods of tense and grudging tolerance, or outright war, for centuries, is to ignore the true root of the problem in favor of the trendy "blame the West" approach du jour</comment>

<comment>And they bring it here.  A German woman, herself an immigrant from Iran at age 13, was also called sexual slurs and had tongues stuck between fingers at her in rude gestures...when she was with her husband, father and upset children on New Years Eve.  She wasn't "a good enough Muslim" apparently.   This stinks.  These are illiterate, sexist people coming en masse and not getting anything more than slaps on the wrist by Germans still cowering from any hint that they could have had Nazi ancestors.</comment>

<comment>It's really sad that our conversation on this issue has gotten to the point where I can't tell whether or not you're kidding.  Poe's Law, I tell you what.</comment>

<comment>Do you know what multicultural and diverse means?  What if your city center was taken over by women touching you for money and wailing like you have hit them?  What if men got up when you sat down at a bus stop? (assuming you are female.)  What if you lived in a land (Germany) where men did not ogle you and suddenly lots of men came and looked at you openly and even grabbed you?  Is this the "diverse" life you'd like everyone to lead?The West is not responsible for Bashar or for the extreme religious views of ISIS. It's not responsible for the fighting in Syria between Kurds and Turks.  The West is not responsible for the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Syira.The West is responsible for letting practically anyone who makes it to their shores get free medical care, housing, and basic monthly income on the backs of taxes and debt for people who can't get roads and infrastructure so they can pay for all the crying children of other people.</comment>

<comment>They aren't asking for "more more more more." Per the article, they are asking the government not to destroy the camp they built. They just want to be left alone.</comment>

<comment>I suppose in France people should just be allowed to build homes wherever they like, without regards to property ownership, building codes or sanitation.  Clearly, there can be no negative repercussions.</comment>

<comment>Well, they want to be left alone so they can make it to the UK.</comment>

<comment>Oh well okay then.  Let's us try that!</comment>

<comment>The UK begs to disagree.</comment>

<comment>Then they should go back to the country the came from, rather than ask the country which they entered illegally and now refuse to leave (unless allowed to go exactly where they'd like to go) to not tear down their encampment.</comment>

<comment>They are asking for more, more, more.  They're even demanding and threatening citizens if they don't get it.  If you can get through, here's a pretty good idea of how the residents of Calais feel:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Right - to be left alone constructing an illegal settlement in someone else's country while attacking commercial vehicles and border guards.That's not acceptable.  We're a society with the rule of law, and guests in our countries are expected to obey the laws like anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Tell them they can live in the shipping containers. When they go into the containers, seal em up and ship em out. </comment>

<comment>make the containers look like that black box in mecca they all worship to ensure they would not figure out the ruse</comment>

<comment>Shameful to be arguing to continue to operate a shantytown just to maintain political pressure on the British.  As between France and Syria, these people are refugees, but as between France and Britain, they're not.  The fact that the UK might be a preferable lifestyle choice is kind of irrelevant, when the UK won't take them.  It's time for France to do the humane thing and resettle them like any other refugees.</comment>

<comment>They don't want to be resettled. They run away. They will stop at nothing to get at what they want.  They don't wished to be shipped to cities far away because they want to get on a ferry over to England.  And what a migrant wants, a migrant eventually gets by hook or by crook...lawyers, lefties and flat out illegality.   Just the types you want in your communities.  People without respect for law or for their effect on other human beings.</comment>

<comment>Shameful, humane thing to do... Like ME countries did for Arabs who left Palestine and that now, after three generations, live in squalid conditions w/o even the possibility to work.Economic migrant or true refugee? Based on the information about THIS place, Calais, they are not Syrians, like the article says, but economic migrants.</comment>

<comment>What was left out of this article is the most compelling reason for these migrants to by-pass all EU countries such as France to get to the UK - benefits.  Healthcare, housing, child allowance, unemployment, etc., are all free and immediately available upon arrival.</comment>

<comment>Some of the 'Jungle' migrants are actual refugees and should be fast-tracked into the UK as refugees.  I'd specify the unaccompanied children. the Iraqis and Afghans who worked as translators for the British Army, the Kurds and the Yazidis.  We got space for them as long as long as they agree to go home once there country is safe.What we don't have space for is every teenage male sex abuser in north Africa or Pakistan who is chancing their arm pretending to be Syrian.  Nor do we have room for admitting every scummy, treacherous Turk who Merkel bribes with EU membership.  There are 500,000 Turks in the UK today, none of whom should be here.  I'd be happpy to deport each and every one to make room for some Syrians.</comment>

<comment>Will somebody please explain to me the awesome power these economic migrants from Africa have?  They can squat on public property, make sales without collecting taxes, urinate in public and so on and never pay a fine nor do time in jail?  I have never seen a more powerful group with more powerful allies--these people and the migrants making their way via the Balkans and Turkey and Russia.Women?  Black movements in America?  They were never able to wield the power that this group of people have.  Never has there been a more powerful constituency on Earth than the migrants of 2015-2016, I don't think.</comment>
