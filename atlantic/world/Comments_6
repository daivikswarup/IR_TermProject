<comment>Russia's involvement is actually pretty straight-forward:  defend a long-time client and help stabilize an Alawite rump state. That it draws the US and it's gulf allies into a quagmire is a bonus.This is a good description of the catch-22 the US finds itself in with the Kurds.  I suspect that if push comes to shove, Washington will stick with its long-time NATO partner and throw the YPG under the bus.  In the meantime, they're trying to thread the needle negotiating some kind of agreement with the other Kurdish factions that disowns the PKK in exchange for some kind of sovereignty in what becomes of the rest of Syria. </comment>

<comment>Also to look tough on the international stage to a domestic audience against an enemy who can deal no real damage against Russia itself.  So it's a no-risk PR war for Russia.</comment>

<comment>Well, other than the dead Russian pilots and civilians.</comment>

<comment>...and, of course, why should we care?...;^)</comment>

<comment>PKK were the army that saved the Yazidi population in Shingal & protect minorities ever since the war in Iraq started.They are one of the most effective anti-ISIS forces & far more democratic than Erdogan & his gang who never target ISIS and support jihadi rebels in Syria.</comment>

<comment>Well, they actually ran away like everyone else when ISIL attacked. They did come back with US airstrikes though, so that's something.</comment>

<comment>WOULD YOU ATTACK WITHOUT WEAPONS OR A PLAN ? TAKES A BIT OF TIME ONCE REGROUPED THEY HAVE BEEN THE BEST---</comment>

<comment>I think that if I had my caps lock working, I need fear no weapons.</comment>

<comment>This is why we shouldn't be involved except as arbitrators of an eventual peace agreement. Besides the US, there are at least a dozen significant actors in the Syrian conflict- Assad, ISIS, al-Nusra, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Syrian Kurds, Iraqi Kurds, Gulf State financiers, Hezbollah - and all have different interests. We have no national interest at stake, and the conflict isn't going to be resolved by our bombing and arms shipments.</comment>

<comment>As long as IS uses the chaos in Syria and Libya as a base of operations to train and plan for terrorist and insurgent operations elsewhere, it's very much our problem.</comment>

<comment>I'd like to add one more thing about who the Kurds really are: They are the only good news in the Middle East for Americans since the 9-11And who the Turks really are? They are exactly NOT a friend you want to have in the back!</comment>

<comment>Kudos to the Kurds! They will build the new Middle East based on human rights and freedom for the individual.Kurds fight ISIS - Turkey bombs them.Russia fights ISIS and the rebels - Turkey shoots their planes down. But has yet hard problems to find and bomb ISIS strongholds just across the border.Try to see the whole chessboard. ISIS are the wild dogs of Turkey. Just like Hezbollah are the errand boys of Iran. The Turks use ISIS to get rid of all the opposition in the Middle East and pave the way for their islamic caliphate. You think that all these ISIS terrorists came from the Mediterranean with Paradise Cruise boats? No. Turkey ran all the ISIS fighters through Turkey to Syria and then supported them financially and with weapons. Erdogan has always dreamt of re-creating the Neo-ottoman Empire and ISIS will help him do that. The new islamofascist Turkey and ISIS are not that different.p.s. Kick Turkey out of NATO. It is not worth going to war for this islamofascist country based on genocide on Greeks, Armenians and Kurds.</comment>

<comment>"Turkey shoots their planes down"I know of only one Russian bomber shot down by Turks. Did I miss the news of more planes being shot down?</comment>

<comment>Very valid analysis. I just can't agree with your positive attitude towards what Russia does in Syria.</comment>

<comment>Why is US not condemning what Russia does in Syria? I don't think this has anything to do with Obama being weak (not to say that he is not, but in this particular case it is irrelevant) because France, UK and Germany are not as harsh as they could be either. I think this has to do with the awareness of who the rebels are. The so called moderate rebels that West has been propping up during the last years has turned out to be nothing more than "moderate beheaders" under the control of Saudia Arabia and Turkey. In theory and in their ideology, they are not much more different than ISIS. This knowledge has made US and other Western powers realise that the sooner the support to these rebels stop, the better off will everyone be. And if Russia decides to bomb them during this time, the response should not go further than a formal complaint.</comment>

<comment>This is one of the few cases in which Russia and the US have been able to agree on something. They've left the Kurds alone and bombed the Islamists. Isn't that what everyone wants?There are no US-aligned "Syrian rebels" left - there are the Kurds (libertarian socialists, have turned to isolationism, full democracy, and pacifism, good guys), Jabhat al-Nusra (Al-Qaeda affiliate, bad guys), Bashar Al-Assad's forces (controlled by corrupt plutocrats and oligarchy, bad guys but not as bad as Islamists), and ISIS (literally Hitler).</comment>

<comment>>They will build the new Middle East based on human rights and freedom for the individual.The Kurdish population in Turkey, if I may generalize, is the most backwards, fanatical part of that country. Stupid blood feuds, honor killings, tribal rivalries. Not to let the government off, but one of the flashpoints in this latest uprising was infrastructure development in the south-east. PKK didn't like the government trying to expand hydropower.KRG, meanwhile, is a dynastic kleptocracy. Iraqi Kurds have been ruled by two people, father and son, for the last seventy years almost without interruption.> genocide on [...] Armenians.Hey, do you know who actually did almost all the killing in the Armenian genocide? </comment>

<comment>Go and check the political platform of HDP which is the main Kurdish party in Turkey. Then you will see that each and every one of the assumptions that you just puked out are false and AKP propaganda. HDP has more female representatives than any other political party in the Middle East (not to mention Asia). 268 of the HDP's 550 candidates were female, which translated to 31 (39 percent) of its 80 deputies. You sir, are nothing more than an AKP troll. Be gone.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, don't really care about political platforms. Go read the platform of the WPK, then come back and tell me how much they matter. I care about how people actually behave, and when you look at how people actually behave, I'm right.Oh, and since you apparently don't know: Kurds did most of the killing. Most of "Kurdistan" isn't Kurdish, it's Armenian, and has been for three thousand years.</comment>

<comment>There is no doubt that some religious and ignorant Kurds cooperated with the Turkish rulers (the Young Turks Military Junta, of which Ataturk was a member) and participated in the Armenian genocide.  But, (1) the buck always stops with the leaders and rulers of the country, not the people who follow them; and (2) the Kurds have repeatedly apologized for their ancestors sins; while the Turkish leaders have never had the decency to even acknowledge that a genocide took place against 1.5 million innocent Armenian Christians, let alone issuing a simple apology.  That is the kind of people the Turks are.</comment>

<comment>you Russians breeded our Kurdish  daughters and came Armenians and turks look little human beings bc they did the same thing.</comment>

<comment>That's now. The AKP came to power on the back of Kurdish support, since the more secular nationalist parties were opposed to Turkey.</comment>

<comment>The Turkish government was building dams in southeast Turkey not because it wanted to "expand hydro power", as you the Turkish troll claim.  The Turkish government was building those dams to flood the region and to make it difficult for the Kurdish Freedom Fighters to move around easily and to continue their fight against the Turkish occupation and domination of the northern part of their homeland, Kurdistan.</comment>

<comment>Didn't know the Kurds were based on rivers.</comment>

<comment>"Erdogan has always dreamt of re-creating the Neo-ottoman Empire"What exactly does this even mean?Also I wouldn't have brought it up, but since you do, let's not forget that it was Kurdish irregulars who did a lot of the killing during the Armenian Genocide (also earlier during the Hamidan massacres), a fact Turkish nationalists regularly bring up to try and absolve the CUP government,</comment>

<comment>What this means is that Turkey still lives in the belief that they deserve an empire but reality is that they have been reduced to an insignificant regional power in the periphery. But in the Turkish psyche they are still a big German shepherd and try to adopt that attitude, even though they in reality are a tiny Chihuahua.The Kurdish irregulars were a small part of the then (in early 1900s) approximately 5-10 million Kurdish population of Turkey. And these  irregulars were the same tribes that were under the control of the Turkish government and which later were used to massacre other Kurds who wanted to secure rights for the Kurds based on their culture. And the HDP ( the main Kurdish party in Turkey and the only thing standing between Erdogan and a complete islamisation of Turkey)  have recognised the Armenian genocide and the Kurdish role in it, and have apologised for this. Meanwhile, Turks don't even recognise the genocide. Source: http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/armen...</comment>

<comment>Turkey is a powerful regional actor and recognises that. But I've seen no evidence that they intend to restore their empire. No serious party in Turkey calls for the restoration of the Ottoman Empire, not even Erdogan's AKP, and there is no Turkish/Ottoman equivalent to, for example, the British Commonwealth.I largely agree with your assessment of the Kurds in the later Ottoman Empire. It's also true that the Kurds would have likely been next on the CUP's list of targets had they survived.But that doesn't alter the fact that if you're going to try and demonize Turks today and argue that Turkey should be kicked out of NATO based on crimes from over 100 years ago (rather than their policies today), then it's perfectly legitimate for me to point out that Kurds played a significant role in them, and that they had attacked Armenians with impunity in the decades beforehand.And if we're going down this route, then lots of NATO members have been guilty of genocidal crimes in their recent pasts, such as France, Spain, Britain, Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary Croatia, and even Greece, which they have been rather reluctant to admit. Should all these countries be kicked out of NATO? I'm afraid there would be nobody left in it.</comment>

<comment>Problem is that the NATO members guilty of genocidal crimes such as  France, Spain, Britain, Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary Croatia, and even Greece are not led by megalomaniac soon-to-be authoritarian rulers that are having grand plans and  are quite on the trigger-happy side. No one wants a major war and no NATO member except Turkey wants to have NATO challenged, because the consequences of that would be dire and I am not sure that NATO would be willing to go into a major war for Erdogan's sake. However, the fact that they would not take to arms for Turkey  would expose a great weakness in the NATO system, hence why US, Germany, UK and France are trying to talk some sense into Ankara and tell them that they will not have the full support of NATO in everything they do.</comment>

<comment>"Problem is that the NATO members guilty of genocidal crimes such as  France, Spain, Britain, Bulgaria, Italy, Hungary Croatia, and even Greece are not led by megalomaniac soon-to-be authoritarian rulers that are having grand plans and  are quite on the trigger-happy side."That's a fair point but you're moving the goal posts. Why not just say Turkey should be kicked out of NATO based on the fact that it has a megalomaniac soon-to-be authoritarian ruler who is having grand plans and is quite on the trigger-happy side, rather than on the basis of historical grievances from a century ago?And let's face it, this has never stopped NATO in the past. NATO membership for Salazar's Portugal, the Greece of the Colonels, Evren's Turkey anyone?"However, the fact that they would not take to arms for Turkey  would expose a great weakness in the NATO system, hence why US, Germany, UK and France are trying to talk some sense into Ankara and tell them that they will not have the full support of NATO in everything they do."That's true. They can't just abandon Turkey who is an important regional ally, but they don't want a direct confrontation with Russia over the issue. And many don't like Erdogan.</comment>

<comment>Let's cut out the  catchy phrases that politicians use in order to get votes and support and tell it like it is: NATO is the protector of the Western way of life much like the Delian league protected the Greek civilisation ,spearheaded by Athens, against the Persian empire. That is it. NATO is there to protect the Western values and culture based on certain principles. And Turkey has never been a part of the  Western civilisation.  They just don't belong in NATO just as they don't belong in the EU. To add insult to injury: They are also a liability and should therefore be kicked out.</comment>

<comment>NATO was created to defend the free world from communism following the Soviet blockade of Berlin.  Not some vaguely defined 'western way of life', as in fact the culture of the various NATO members varies widely, and some could be considered 'non-Western' depending on your definition of the term.</comment>

<comment>I agree in your assumptions but not in your conclusion. What NATO was create to protect from communism was a set of independent states that were a part of the Western civilisation that shared a common culture and way of life that also believed in certain principles. A Spaniard and a German have more in common than a Spaniard and a Chinese.</comment>

<comment>Culture really had very little to do with it. It was essentially America plus countries in Europe that were non-Communist. Countries in Asia were protected through other treaty alliances. Since the collapse of Communism NATO has spread to incorporate those former Communist states who wanted to join. Principles had little to do with it, at least initially. Hence why Salazar's Portugal, the Greece of the Colonels and Evren's Turkey were allowed to join (all of whom were as bad as or worse than Erdogan). There was even serious consideration of allowing Franco's Spain to join; the only reason he wasn't able to was because there was still a bad taste in Europe over his connections with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy during WW2."A Spaniard and a German have more in common than a Spaniard and a Chinese."I guess, but it's not always so clean cut. Here in the Balkans, there is a lot of Turkish influence in our culture, even if the locals don't always like to admit it. Yet there are Balkan states in NATO and others who are serious candidates. Are we non-Western as well?</comment>

<comment>Even if Portugal and Greece were led by dictators they were still Christian countries and based on certain principles. A Norwegian would be able to better orient  himself in Portugal than in Iran as there are more similarities: They derive a lot of their culture from the empires of Europe that have come and gone, common holidays, they believe in secularism,  women are free to marry the guy of their own choice and have right to vote etc.etc.  No one would get stoned for cheating on their husband, not even in "the Greece of the Colonels." So I would say there is a Western civilisation and that is the role of NATO to protect that. Otherwise, Japan and South Korea would have also been included in this alliance.</comment>

<comment>So your saying that your womens the others countries womens  are cheaters ( hoes, whores , nasty bitches, betrayaled nuts lol... ) or is it that your that nasty type of human being you are...</comment>

<comment>Do you understand English? How did you draw this conclusion form what I said? I meant to say that in the Western hemisphere (more or less) a woman is free to do whatever she wants and marry anyone of her choosing and people are not stoned to death for having extramarital affairs.</comment>

<comment>Not really. Germany in 1940 was quite different from other Western countries, and at war with most of them.</comment>

<comment>You coping out?</comment>

<comment>Turkey definitely belongs in the EU. Much of the current problems with the EU could have been avoided if Turkey had joined sooner, especially with the refugees.</comment>

<comment>Most of the EU doesn't belong in the EU, but Turkey?  It's not even European.</comment>

<comment>You misunderstand the problem. The problems of EU are MADE IN TURKEY,  not SOLVED BY TURKEY.  Adding more Turkish involvement to this problem will add more fuel to this fire that is threatening Europe. Turkey has been led by Sultans and based on expansive and somewhat radical Islam for the last 1000 years.  That is the real Turkey. Not the 60 year old secular Turkey that history will see as an anomaly. Back to the roots. Hence why the Sultan Erdogan is so popular with Turks outside Istanbul (which is the real Turkey)</comment>

<comment>Let me repeat what I said in response to another Turkish troll like yourself.  There is no doubt that some religious and ignorant Kurds cooperated with the Turkish rulers (the Young Turks Military Junta, of which Ataturk was a member) and participated in the Armenian genocide.  But, (1) the buck always stops with the leaders and rulers of the country, not the people who follow them; and (2) the Kurds have repeatedly apologized for their ancestors sins; while the Turkish leaders have never had the decency to even acknowledge that a genocide took place against 1.5  million innocent Armenian Christians, let alone issuing a simple  apology.  That is the kind of people the Turks are.</comment>

<comment>The Kurds had their own interests in kicking out the Armenians. They were not innocent bystanders, but we're prime instigators.</comment>

<comment>I'm not Turkish, as my profile picture, some of my comments, and a simple look at my profile page should indicate to you quite clearly. You're just racst scum.Let's see if you can spot the contradiction:"  But, (1) the buck always stops with the leaders and rulers of the country, not the people who follow them>/i>"and" The Turkish leaders have never had the decency to even acknowledge that a genocide took place against 1.5  million innocent Armenian Christians, let alone issuing a simple  apology.  That is the kind of  people the Turks are."I agree Turkey should acknowledge and apologize for the Armenian genocide. Nothing I have ever said should indicate otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Turkey makes the mistake of lumping all Kurds with the PKK.If Turkey only focused on the PKK while working to foster closer relations with other Kurdish groups, it would probably find it would have a lot less problems.</comment>

<comment>I agree, but Erodogan is making the "mistake" of lumping all the Kurds with the PKK the same way that Republicans have "mistakenly" identified Obama as a radical socialist when he's really been a centrist all along. Erodogan's AKP was threatened electorally by moderate Kurds, so smearing them as them as radicals was in his best interest, even if it isn't in the best interests of Turkey as a country.</comment>

<comment>Turkey does have close relationships with other Kurdish groups. That's why they had that base in N.Iraq.</comment>

<comment>>The Obama administration harbored a different view. American officials believed, rather, that Russian intervention would create an environment where all the relevant players—Assad, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Syria’s opposition—would come off of their maximalist positions and negotiate in good faith....which is what happened. We've got a ceasefire agreement now. There's been more diplomatic progress in the months since the Russians came in than in the entire war before that. A lot of the opposition have rejected the ceasefire because it doesn't extend to Al Qaeda, but that just clarifies the situation - and backs up what the Syrians have been saying all along.Still, not a bad article by the low standards of these sorts of articles. At least tries to elucidate the Kurdish issue</comment>

<comment>Independent Kurdish nation state is the only hope for the ME, and it's very long overdue.</comment>

<comment>They live next to the whey.</comment>

<comment>Who are the Kurds? The only ones doing a d*mn thing</comment>

<comment>I once read a novel named The Ten Thousand. Based on true events it is about a force of Greeks who travel to what is now Iraq to instigate a regime change, in about 400 BC. The Greek hero Xenophon leads them. Things go badly and the Greeks have to beat a hasty retreat to safety. They head north to the coast of the Black Sea and pass through Kurdish lands. The Kurds were already well established in the area. They've been there for who-knows-how-long, 1000 BC? 2000 BC? Anyone's guess.They are more deserving of their own country than most peoples.Harper's Magazine recently ran an article about the Kurds. They are front and center in the fight against ISIS. They are good fighters but lack basic equipment. This article said about 90% of their losses come from IED bombs left behind by the retreating ISIS men. If the Kurds had more armored suits and teams of bomb disposal experts it would go a long way toward helping them defeat ISIS.</comment>

<comment>They are the Assyrians, you know, the ones who invented iron tools and weapons.  They aren't just good fighters, they are a nightmare as opponents in mountain warfare.</comment>

<comment>this is unlikely. Assyrian are semitic people like Jews and Arabs. Kurds are believed to have Iranian origin, their language is Indo-European. Beside there is already ethnic group in middle east that call themselves Assyrian, they are Christians, and their lands are kind of overlaps with ancient Assyrian kingdom.</comment>

<comment>they claim Median descent that puts around 700BC. Assuming that they came with Median empire.</comment>

<comment>THe Kurds are easy to recognize.  They are the bad asses walking where ever they want.Iraq is right to try to keep them out of the fight for Mosul.  If the Kurds take the city, it will take another war to pry them out.</comment>

<comment>Then maybe they are the ones that we should support and side with? They seem more loyal than the islamists that we have sided with so far.</comment>

<comment>They are more loyal to us than we are to them.We give the Kurds tons of support.  However, how many of our "allies" would we piss off if we let, or worse, helped, the Kurds carve out a Kurdistan?  In the best part of Iraq?We'd be creating a new Israel and an environment of near constant war as the Shi'ites and Kurds blow the hell out of each other.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps that is better than the constant low-intensity conflict that has characterised this region for soon 100-years now. The current borders are defunct! They are unnatural and there will continue to be conflict as long as the border look the way they are now. And I doubt that Kurdistan would look like Israel because there would not be a significant Arabic population in a  future Kurdistan which would create a civil war. I think the region needs another democratic and Western -oriented state like Israel, and Kurdistan is a good candidate.</comment>

<comment>"Kurdistan" would be a lodestone for conflict.  Every one of the border countries has problems with the Kurds.  They have always been at odds with Arabs.  And Kurds just love, love, love to kill Arabs; the more the better.  Probably Persians and Turks too.That's what I meant about the similarity to Israel.  It wouldn't be a religious based war, but racial.The ME has always been fighting.  When they aren't fighting the Western powers, they fight each other.  Maybe that's just a human condition.  I don't know. There's probably not enough beer to talk about it.</comment>

<comment>About 30% of the Kurds are Shia.</comment>

<comment>Where did you get that information?</comment>

<comment>CIA online for that portion of Kurdistan in Iran.  I seem to recall Sunni and Sufi make up the rest, with the majority Sunni (~60%).</comment>

<comment>Since you saw it online, perhaps you could go in your "history" and get us the link!</comment>

<comment>https://www.cia.gov/library</comment>

<comment>Interesting commentary on those numbers.http://www.theamericanconserva...</comment>

<comment>Maybe, but the hierarchy of loyalty in the ME is family, tribe, religion, nation.  I think the Kurds could swap 3 and 4 with no problem.  That's only my opinion though.There's a reason we keep ending up on the same side despite our history of abandoning our allies.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't argue that hierarchy at all with you.  That is why the Peshmerga coming out more or less unified signifies suggest the top three attributes are generally in tune among the Kurds, despite the incredible effort Ergodan has expended to prevent it.</comment>

<comment>So you want us to fear helping our ally, the Kurds?</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying that at all.  We provide tons of support of all types to the kurds right now.  Your congressman knows how much.  They have a powerful lobby that makes him/her jump.im serious, i dont mean that in a bad way.</comment>

<comment>Your rhetoric states something different.</comment>

<comment>You misunderstand.  That's all.</comment>

<comment>Nope, you misunderstand that we understand you very clearly.</comment>

<comment>Profound.</comment>

<comment>Both Turkish and Kurdish nationalism are very impressive, they both deserve ethnostatesIf ISIS ever goes the Kurds should get a chunk of that northern territory for their new country</comment>

<comment>Ergodan, as an Islamist, has been complicit in ISIS recruitment, black market operations, logistic support.  Second, in Iraq we have been allied with the Kurds since Clinton's no fly zone era.  Third, there is no Iraq, just a convenient fiction for public consumption.To those who care, the demographics of Turkey suggest that ~50% of the population of Turkey, yes Turkey, will be Kurdish by 2050.  It's such a sensitive issue the Kurds are known as Mountain Turks officially, inside Turkey to hide that coming reality.We do not want to be on the contrary side to the Kurds in Rojave (northern Syria) after what transpired in Kobane.  It is their intent to kill ISIS to the last man.  Right now the ratio is 15-20 to one as they set out to accomplish that task.  I for one can count.</comment>

<comment>A Muslim cannot be a Kurd; a Kurd cannot be a Muslim   26.12.2009     Translated from Kurdish by W.S.  December 26, 2009 With the continuation of the ancient Kurdish traditions such as the hundreds of types of dances and styles of music, the colorful dresses, love between boys and girls, we could say that these traditions were much stronger before Islam and that the Kurdish people were much more progressive and rational before the occupation of Kurdistan by Islam. Kurdish women had greater freedom and equal rights. But with the coming of Islam not only did they not accomplish anything new, but all that they did have, they lost. It is true that the nations of the Middle East in general, and especially Kurds, were oppressed by the Arabs. It is true that we fought against them and that we are angry with them, and that we are not Muslim, and still rejects Islam. But it is also true that due to our human solidarity instincts and feelings for fellow humans, we love the Arabic speaking people and greatly respect them. We are and will be ready to have social and friendly relationship with them. The fact that many Kurdish men have Arabic wives and vice versa proves the humanistic nature and peacefulness of the Kurds original culture towards the entire world. Our problem is not against Arabs, but Arab Islamist occupiers.http://ekurd.net/mismas/articl...</comment>

<comment>In my dream world .......We  tell the U.N. to promote the establishment of a free and independent state of Kurdistan. Get them away from Iraqi rule. We talk Turkey into ceding a few million acres . Maybe we could use that carrot to get the PKK to stop bombing in Turkey.Arm them to the teeth and let the Kurds determine the fate of the Middle East. They're the only rational people in the whole region. I'm not condoning the terrorists, but even the PKK tries to minimize civilian casualties by going after military targets. That's still bad, but the terrorists who target civilians first, like ISIS, Al-Queda  etc., are higher on the scale of evil.I've like all the Kurds I've met. A few dozen over the years.More than I can say about any other culture. Even among we Americans.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry about independence, just give them autonomy to decide their own fate & the PKK will dance down the mountains. They want to live as human beings, not as slaves to an oppressive fascist state.</comment>

<comment>On February 23, 2016 there was an article in THE WORLD POST written by Stanley Weiss about the danger that Turkey poses to the entire world today.  I advise everybody to take a look at that article.  Here is the link:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>Keep US, Turkey and Saudi involvement out of Syria. Let Russia defend Assad and help retake territory lost to ISIS.</comment>

<comment>The PYD and its armed forces (the YPG) long ago rejected the Maoist precepts in favor of the isolationist, pacifist anarchist doctrine of democratic confederalism. They're hardly the same!https://roarmag.org/essays/boo...</comment>

<comment>The Kurd's are a race of people that have existed on the land they now occupy long before the Turkish  race of people arrived , and who the Turkish regime now want permission from the U.N. and the U.S. and their allies to commit genocide against , that's who the Kurd's are !!</comment>

<comment>It's funny how a nation can evolve yet at the same time can never loose a rotten element of their core. Such as the Turks. Cunningly ruthless. How can you trust a nation split into two unbareable extremes the nationalist (grey wolves) and the Islamists AKP. Let them wipe each other out. Legacy? The Balkans, the Caucasus, the Levent, Northern Africa and Arabia... Wonderful mess. </comment>

<comment>Yet, still no match for how cruel and cunning Britain was.. Ask Ireland and India, Kenya and South Africa..</comment>

<comment>To label the PKK a 'terrorist' organization and leave it at that is duplicitous. For generations, Turkish governments have oppressed and marginalized Kurds with power soft and hard, including mass murder of civilians. The term for this behavior is 'state terrorism.' One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter: Kurds and many others would see the PKK as the latter.</comment>

<comment>Strongly agree.  Kick them out of NATO, deport their citizens from the EU, and never even think of letting them in the EU.  And take every refugee that arrives in Greece and ferry them straight back to Turkey to apply for refugee status in that safe country via consulates.</comment>

<comment>There are about six comments on this article that aren't downvoted to hell. You don't really even see that with other contentious issues. Huh.</comment>

<comment>The problem is the world is always looking for the United States to 'get involved' when the neighbors next door to the 'problem country' do little to nothing, or exacerbate the situation. Syria is a classic example. Turkey should have gotten involved over a year ago in combating the spread of ISIS but did nothing.Turkey for the last 80 years has been too busy killing or crushing its ethnic minorities (the Christians, the Armenians, the Greeks and the Kurds) who all used to live in Turkey in high numbers for thousands of years, until they became a much hated thing to eradicate. Awful.</comment>

<comment>WHEN LOOKING AT WHAT THEY HAVE DONE ONLY IN TURKEY WHERE THEY HAVE FOR CENTURIES TRIED TO GET A HOMELAND SOMETHING ALL OTHER TERRORISTS ALREADY HAVE FOR THE MOST PART --THE KURDS HAVE BEEN OF MOST STALWART ALLIES IN IRAQ--WE HAVE BEEN STUPID FOR NOT ARMING THEM--SINCE THEY HAVE BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE IN FIGHTING ISIS--</comment>

<comment>What worries me is that Turkey is in NATO.  The US will need to do what it can to keep it stable, and to support the status quo.  Even though it appears that many in Turkey are helping IS sell the oil to pay for weapons to keep things unstable.I admire some of the Kurds, but with the caveat: like most former bits of the Ottoman Empire, nothing is ever what it seems to be.Stability in the region would be good, but it's obviously not something that most want, including the US.  Stability for one group is oppression for another.</comment>

<comment>The title : no Kurds are not terrorist. The terrorist are those whom came up with terror. And that might be you and your mother and your father , america , isreal , killers like Britain and rest of the West.. And your mothers is at the turkish bar (muslims) giving head .. </comment>

<comment>Turkey will be indispensable in checking the southern flank of Russia and the Black Sea basin just as it was in during the Cold war. We will need Turkey in the future and must make sure that the country is stable and solid (not least because if there is a call to arms Turkey is far more reliable than a lot of other Nato allies, e.g., France and Italy).Kurds are notoriously fractured along religious and intra-ethnic lines and are "strangers" in all the countries where they live; this is true in the Caucasus, Turkey, Iran, Iraq, etc. They are still ruled more through almost an feudal hierarchy than the government structures that exist in these places (which are fairly strong and progressive in the Caucasus, Turkey and Iran). Kurds are no strangers to internecine war and, I believe, should a Kurdish state come to exist it will be worse than Syria.</comment>

<comment>It is naive to argue that independence is ever granted; it is always won with arms.How many people commenting on this article have been to Turkey and the so-called Kurdistan (I have)? Kurds have become more-or-less civilized (sorry, I hate the word.. it's patronizing and I don't intend it to be; another way to put it is that they progressed to some later stage of feudalism) through exposure to the state institutions of Turkey. It's almost like they are at a natural disadvantage.Ah, and those "Turks" in Europe - they are mostly Kurds. I have yet to see one to advance past making doners anywhere in Europe.</comment>

<comment>It's extremely sad to see the secular democracy of Turkey turned into an Islamist dictatorship by Erdogan. The man is evil and is putting his religious agenda ahead of the well being of Turkey. With allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who needs enemies. The Saudis are by far the largest sponsor of terrorism in the world. The Wahhabism they are spreading around the world is repressive and downright evil.</comment>

<comment>So, uh, why the hell is the US meddling in anything beyond the piece of land between Alaska and South Padre Island? Oh yes, resources and power. Sorry, I forgot.</comment>

<comment>Who are the YPG/PYD?  Just another terrorist group like the PKK:  http://www.theguardian.com/wor...</comment>

<comment>Who are the Kurds, you ask?They, along with the Israelis are our only friends in the Middle East.Despite our betrayals of the Kurds when denying them their own land when we drew up mid-east boundaries last century, and again when we allowed Saddam, the Turks and the Syrians to oppress them, it is not too late to carve out a homeland for these good, loyal friends.That would upset the Turks, Iraqis and the Syrians, you say?So what? They hate all us with a passion, anyway, so that's no reason we shouldn't do one good deed in the middle east.</comment>

<comment>Interesting article, although it doesn't address the deeper issue of their origins. The late Michael Kelly noted that they didn't exactly look like others in the region, and believed they were more like the Irish than Arabs or Persians. Others have suggested they are descendants of the ancient Medes. Does anyone know?</comment>

<comment>I hear that the Turks like to shoot down their friends' planes and to kill their pilots. Otherwise, they are the most excellent and reliable friends anyone should want to have.</comment>

<comment>Such a cheap writing which put the brave secular and pro-Western  Kurds in the same level of terrorist and anti-Western Jihadists! The writer is just pro-Turkish and old fashion mentality although it is obvious that the Islamist gov of Turkey supports IS and other Jihadist groups. The writing has no in depth analysis but full of stereotypic fallacies. </comment>
