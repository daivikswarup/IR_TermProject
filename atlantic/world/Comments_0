<comment>"What Is Ideological Necrophilia?"A clever, sesquipedalian way of describing "no original ideas will be found here." That sounds about right to me, but then I like words and diction and stuff.</comment>

<comment>"no original ideas will be found here."Well, that "here" is pretty much everywhere...</comment>

<comment>Well, frankly, how many brand-new political ideas did you encounter recently?</comment>

<comment>We used to call that "Flogging a Dead Horse" but I guess that is not headline grabby enough.</comment>

<comment>No I don't think any nation in the world considers borders and rules for new citizens to be an outdated ideology.You are correct about Sanders and Marxism though</comment>

<comment>are you implying that sanders is some kind of marxist?</comment>

<comment>I'd go with national socialism if he would prefer that</comment>

<comment>well, whatever floats your boat.</comment>

<comment>No, not whatever floats his boat. Correct people when they're incorrect! This is why the internet is stupid: no one says anything when the other person is clearly wrong!</comment>

<comment>That's not true. You can try, like I have for 22 years on various message boards, bbs, and forums. The problem is that no one is "real" on the internet. You can't see facial expression, can't look them in the eye, can't smell their breath, and can't hear or touch them. It's very pointless. Like trying to hold a serious conversation during a pep rally. Eventually I got comfortable just flaming people instead of trying to reason with them. No one wants to reason on the internet, they just want to fling turds at each other.</comment>

<comment>why?  you think he's going to have some "ah-ha" moment and realize he's wrong?   i know he's wrong.  i implied he's wrong, and that's all that matters to me.besides, he very well could be a troll and for me it's just not worth the time.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be rather uneducated.Nazi Germany wasn't socialist if we're going to take the definition of socialism (definition of socialism: Socialism is a range of social and economic systems characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production) and uphold its criteria.Believe it or not, neither is Bernie Sanders a socialist if we're judging his positions by his platform. The proper term for him is a social democrat. He's in the same vein as FDR, not Marx.</comment>

<comment>Are you saying that National Socialist Germany wasn't socialist?Hitler didn't have enough time, or he was more pragmatic, but he certainly wasn't a small government libertarian either.Read what he, and Mussolini had to say about capitalism, the church, education, etc.  might be a bit uncomfortable to read.</comment>

<comment>Let's use another example: Do you really believe that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is really a democratic republic? The Nazis may have had "socialist" in the name but they were surely not what it said on the tin.</comment>

<comment>How refreshing, a reasoned reply on the Internet.  You are rare indeed.Oddly, the average dictator does seem to mention what you talk about.  Give nice names.  Yet the various "people's democratic socialist..." Republics have resulted in roughly 130 million deaths in the 20th century, so point for you on oddly named places.Both Hitler's National Socialists and Mussolini's Fascists certainly were not small government, free market situations by any stretch.  Both railed against capitalism (and religion, for that matter).  Hitler was big on healthcare, gun control, paid education, increased welfare, massive jobs programs (the jobs programs were most certainly socialist, as they were all government based, government run, etc.).The rest of the economy...a different story.  Private ownership, but massive regulation from the government.  Corporatism?  Except many people mistakenly think that means the corporations run the government.  I cannot imagine Messerschmidt doing what hitler wanted and expecting him to go along with it.But if that is the case, then fast forward to today.  Many of the socialist governments and socialist parties do not seem to do socialism either.  I am not seeing large scale nationalization in France, for example.  Additional regulation, sure, but nothing nationalized.  So if they can call themselves socialist, why not hitler?Bernie Sanders has been talking about socialist Denmark, and such, but they (the Danes) finally came back and said, "uhm yea...we are capitalist."Here is one other question - if you look at fascist/national socialist economics, then obamacare, can you identify differences?  Private ownership...100% regulation from government...?  </comment>

<comment>Nazism and Mussolini's fascism are really like a bad mix-tape of political ideologies. I'm not sure how else you can look at it, because they're really not "pure-left" or "pure-right" on the spectrum.Your remark on Obamacare and fascism is nonsensical.</comment>

<comment>Nonsensical only because no one teaches fascist economics. Where socialism sought totalitarian control of a society’s economic processes through direct state operation of the means of production, fascism sought that control indirectly, through domination of nominally private owners.Obamacare - everyone has to have healthcare?  Check.  Domination (through regulation) of the insurance carriers?  Check.  Insurance still in private hands?  Check.  How is Obamacare not fascist?</comment>

<comment>Fascism is corporatism, or government control of corporations to achieve a government directive.  Obamacare does that with health insurance companies.  Health insurance companies, in effect, are now agencies of our central government.</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>The ideology is not the point.  The fact that there was government control was the problem.  Any ideology will abuse power, when they have the opportunity.  Socialism provides the power.</comment>

<comment>Countries that call themselves "People's Republics" or "Democratic People's Republics" are usually neither republics nor democracies, nor are they ruled by or for their citizens. They are dictatorships or corrupted democracies.</comment>

<comment>Nazi Germany was a statist, yes, but  it wasn't either capitalist or socialist; Fascist economies are privately owned, yes, but unlike Soviet state capitalism, they don't operate for profit. Their sole goal is to prepare for war, and thus are maximally efficient because that's stipulated in the growth incentive.There are alternatives to both state-planned economies and the market, however; socialism is one of them, communism is another. Neither have ever actually been implemented, although various components have been used.Socialism =/= nationalization of the economyMarket socialism is a popular model among socialists, for example. It's not too different from Denmark's social democracy (which is still capitalist because the means of production are privately held), but it replaces corporations with worker-owned cooperatives.Some models of actual socialism even advocate the complete elimination of the state (anarchism). There's even a strain of entirely stateless communism (anarcho-communism) which has worked before. The proponents were called Makhnovshchina, and they fought the Bolsheviks in southern Ukraine during the Russian Civil War.tl;dr: no, National Socialism is not socialism. What you were taught in school is likely wrong.</comment>

<comment>Spew your own definitions all you want.  Hitler was a left wing socialist who supported the exact same policies then that Sanders does today.</comment>

<comment>Guess which current Republican candidate gave this speech:"The national government will maintain and defend the foundations on which the power of our nation rests. It will offer strong protection to Christianity as the very basis of our collective morality. Today Christians stand at the head of our country. We want to fill our culture again, with the Christian spirit as our guide for humanity, We want to burn out all the recent immoral developments in literature, in the theatre, and in the press -- in short, we want to burn out the poison of immorality which has entered into our whole life and culture as a result of LIBERAL excess during the past years."NONE of them did, but any of them could have.It is from a speech Hitler gave AFTER coming to power.Adolf Hitler 1922-1939, Vol. 1, Michael Hakeem, Ph.D. (London, Oxford University Press, 1942) 871Hitler was a hardline rightwinger. He was exceptionally religious (a Roman Catholic, to be specific) and believed in the "traditional values" (anti-gay, anti-abortion, "women should be in the kitchen", etc.) pushed by today's Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Hitler also said, 'The worst thing Jews brought the world was Christianity.'</comment>

<comment>I was t taught it in school.  Educate toes rarely use the word "socialist" when mentioning the name of Adolf Hitler's party.  I would think that over 90% of the population would not know the actual name.I wonder why lefty teachers would not want to use the word "socialist" when mentioning  Hitler's party, even though it is the actual name of his party.I don't wonde actually, but it is fun to needle a little bit.  </comment>

<comment>Perhaps the reluctance to use the term 'Socialist' in mentioning the Nazi Party was an effort to save people from embarrassment later in life. After all, a child who focuses on the term 'socialist' in the name 'National Socialist' is apt to grow into an adult who compulsively repeats such non-fact factoids as 'Hitler was a socialist' despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.</comment>

<comment> Well how far off was Hitler from a garden-variety socialist? Again, he did not own the means of production. Point for your side . Massive jobs programs, employment for all? Yes. Nationalized healthcare? Yes. Free public education all the way through college? Yes.  Gun control and gun confiscation? ? Yes. Separating of people into groups? Yes. Not exactly a small government free market libertarian! </comment>

<comment>Um, I was talking about socialism as the term is usually used *outside* of your skull -- consensus reality, you know? Otherwise, all debate devolves to a bunch of Red Queens squabbling pointlessly.Many (most?) of your bullet points have nothing to do with socialism; however, they *do* illustrate my point beautifully: People who don't understand a philosophy but have been taught to dislike it tend to ascribe other beliefs or positions they have been taught to dislike to that philosophy.Although in this country such behavior is most commonly found on the right, this more likely reflects the past century's worth of anti-left propaganda than anything intrinsic to conservative thought. Certainly the term 'fascist' has been tossed around by the left with as little regard for accuracy.</comment>

<comment>Alrighty.Yes - Hitler did not own the means of production - Stalin did (20 - 30 million dead), and so did Mao (70 million - 100 million dead).  As did Pol Pot.  The scandanavian countries the left likes to point to as being successful, are capitalist.'Red Queens?'Actually, if you look at the behavior in this country, is it really found on the right?  Certainly in some aspects (the use of emotion opposed to logic and reasoning is engrained in the body politic, but was most competently outlined by both Alinsky and Mussolini).think about it - micro aggressions - a new term of the left.  Thought police - a concept of the left.  Is there freedom of speech on campus?  Of course not - who is guilty of this?  I don't see tea party people smashing windows, burning buildings, nor crying that someone said that America was great.  Did you see of the professor that was fired for calling for 'muscle' to remove reporters from college campuses?Calling for "muscle" - kinda sounds like a certain austrian.  I doubt she will be a trump voter...Even Camille Paglia bemoaned 'mummified fascism' with how there were comments about a 'special place in hell' for women that did not support Hillary (from Albright).Speech codes, riots, threats of violence on campus, all from left wing fascists.  Yes - you can cite stuff from the right in the USA, but, the left is far, far better at it.Look at it this way - one crazy with a confederate flag shoots up a church - no end of wrath toward the confederate flag.  Terrorists blow up the towers and the left wrings their hands on what WE did to make them mad?  Ask yourself - why the different standard?</comment>

<comment>Socialism is government control.  FA Hayek made the case that there was no difference between Communism and Fascism.  The result is the same, government control.</comment>

<comment>Then what's social anarchism, the socialist rejection of the concept of the state itself? In fact, actual communism, which has never been achieved before, is itself a stateless society in conception. Well, there has been one case of actual communism: the democratic Iroquois Confederation, which has also has the world's oldest living constitution.Friedrich Hayek simply didn't know what he was talking about.Besides, the Lange model (the response to the Austrian critics of central planning) and decentralized planning both overcome the critique of Austrian economics.I prefer decentralized planning (a syndicalist variant, to be specific) because it is, itself, based on economic democracy. Rather than achieve democracy through the state, regional cooperatives elect delegates within themselves to manage the cooperative; delegates are then sent to regional councils, which elect national councils to run entire industries.Through a system of stock control (start with a surplus stock of a product at a distribution point, measure the rate of depletion to determine how much must be produced), industries produce what each community needs, and no more. Thus, production is only for use, as it should be. Calculation in kind (calculating costs based on the utility of combinations) is used instead of money; it can factor in social costs as well as financial costs. Although his work was never used, a Soviet mathematician and pioneer of linear computation by the name of Leonid Kantorovich worked through mathematical proofs to prove the feasibility of calculation in kind for the production of all products. This is the basis for a decentralized planned economy, much as the exchange of money as a common unit of calculation of utility for goods (markets) and private ownership of the means of production for profit are the basis for capitalism.Clearly, FA Hayek and I have very different ideas of what "socialism" is. Syndicalism was already a significant current in socialist thought by Hayek's time. In fact, Daniel DeLeon, a Marxist syndicalist whose ideas closely match mine, created his ideas prior to the turn of the century, before the proposed state socialism of Leninism was even an idea (Lenin's ideological debut was in 1903).The Austrian argument against socialism falls apart once it becomes apparent that it is, in fact, a straw man. I dislike central planning for the same reason as Hayek, in fact. That is, however, not the only kind of socialism.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you're right. From now on it's Bernie Sanders, Free Market Champion.</comment>

<comment>i never said he was a free market champion so how could i be right?but calling him a marxist is bit hyperbolic</comment>

<comment>Boy, wasn't that point dying to be made throughout the article? I thought he'd never get there. Yep, ideological necrophilia. It has a certain ring to it.</comment>

<comment>If someone tells you that national sovereignty and border security are "dead ideas", that person is your enemy.</comment>

<comment>You're a Trump stormtrooper I take it...</comment>

<comment>Heaven forbid, no one would want to be a "Trump stormtrooper". So, perhaps you can tell us how that would play out. If, for instance, China wanted 20 million Chinese citizens to move here and wanted to keep in close touch with them, is that something a thoroughly modern person like you would support?As for border walls (which are in practice usually fencing), they've worked where they've been tried such as in the San Diego area. They also tend to work in some other countries I could name.That said, the Trump Wall is a crazy idea and completely unnecessary; we don't need to wall off the entire border with an actual wall. Illegal immigration is a mind war between the elites and the people. It's winnable intellectually. The problem is the people tend to be loud and stupid and only think of and support lunkhead ideas like building a wall. They aren't capable of discrediting illegal immigration supporters or helping those who can. They can't even see the benefit in doing that but have to have things that blow up real good.</comment>

<comment>> That said, the Trump Wall is a crazy idea and completely unnecessary; we don't need to wall off the entire border with an actual wall.You're right. What we should be doing is conquering Mexico. Think about this: the further down south we go, the less of a wall we need to build!(courtesy of Mr Colbert)</comment>

<comment>Take your idea a little further.  China loads up super tankers with 60,000,000 people.  Not even a blip to them, but the way we vote, that would be enough to install a Maoist government here.And the democrats are trying to get voting rights for illegals right now.Democrats would be so happy with a cultural revolution....</comment>

<comment>Do you want to hel the poor?  I am not sure importing 40 million unskilled workers into the workforce will accomplish that.Do you want to see wages for lower skilled workers increase?  Do you want to close the gap between rich and poor?  Importing 40 million people willing to work at minimum wage, allowing big business to fire existing, higher paid workers, may not be the solution.Ever find it odd that the chamber of commerce republicans (i.e., business types) and democrats are on the same page?  Democrats are looking for new voters.  Big business is looking for an endless supply of cheap labor.But certainly, ignore the argument and call him a 'storm trooper' - oh wow, it worked!  You saying that just lowered unemployment in Detroit and the average wage is now up an extra $5 an hour!  Dude, you converted me!  Actual laws of economics really don't apply!  </comment>

<comment>Here we see a perfect specimen of the "Very Serious Person": a perfect example of the bandwagon fallacy, they are intellectually constipated because whatever the political establishment consensus is is truth to them. They like to think that they are somehow more rationalThey make sure to never say "the emperor has no clothes!" until everyone else has. In the US, they hang on to such dead ideas such as the War On Drugs, neoliberal economics, and test-based education, not because they work, but because they're accepted by other "very serious people". http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/V...</comment>

<comment>BAWHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHA. Hillary rational....she is a deluded, entitled, old hag who hates america. She is a liar and a traitor who should be in federal prison.  The only reason she is not, is because her last name is Clinton.</comment>

<comment>She's the embodiment of the class system that allows the elite to behave however they please while the rest of us get thrown in jail for parking tickets and pot.  If I'd done what she did while I worked for the government, I would be in a black site right now waiting to die.  It's absolutely bizarre to me that people see that woman as looking out for their interests, she literally got to where she is through crimes that would have ended your life or mine, had we been caught like she was.  How can you support that?</comment>

<comment>Well.....no. Centrist? Don't think so. Rational? Well, serial killers are rational too, in their way. In any case, there's that little problem with honesty and integrity. Nothing else matters when you're guilty of felonious behavior.</comment>

<comment>Vote for the lying crook, it is important.</comment>

<comment>How in the heck can an idea be "dead" if large quantities of people still hold it?  Sounds like this is skirting intellectual snobbery: I disagree with these ideas, so they are dead, which makes them sound a lot less appealing.Mind you, I'm not agreeing with any of the ideologies raised in this article.  I am saying that the term smacks of nominative emotional manipulation.</comment>

<comment>Well, there aren't too many Maoists out there any more.</comment>

<comment>Well, yeah, but right there you just admitted that there are some.  I might accept "ideological hibernation" for ideas that exist but are not particularly active with any serious force.</comment>

<comment>Ok, how 'bout "obviously and provably ineffective a large margin", then?</comment>

<comment>Would you accept "down for the count" for a KO or TKO?</comment>

<comment>except at Cornell , NYU, Columbia, Princeton, Harvard     etc etc</comment>

<comment>No. That's only in the minds of Breitbartians. You know, the people who think that sharia is going to overtake Constitutional law.</comment>

<comment>I thought it already has or, at least, to be fair and balanced,  soon will.</comment>

<comment>Look on any college campus.  Ask any hippie growing pot in Northern California.  Mao is alive and well, thank you.</comment>

<comment>ever heard of religion and gods? long dead but billions of people are still lingering on, hoping and praying that one of those thousands of gods will finally do something.</comment>

<comment>...and there's the mandatory religion comment.</comment>

<comment>Probably because it's so bleedin' obvious.</comment>

<comment>97% of all human beings alive today believe in a religion. How is religion a dead idea?</comment>

<comment>97% are believers.  The other 3% are believers and are living in denial of it.</comment>

<comment>A huge number of people are creationists, but I would still say creationism is a dead idea, because all the evidence and experts in the field point to it being wrong.That's different from just disagreeing with an idea--for example, I disagree with the argument that low-skill immigration reduces wages for low-skill Americans, but there is evidence and a decent argument to be made on both sides, so that idea is not dead.</comment>

<comment>Dead maens no longer functional or relevant, a hindrance to progress and health and happiness. Like bleeding to treat illnesses etc</comment>

<comment>He doesn't proclaim the ideas "dead" because he disagrees with them. He proclaims them dead because there is empirical evidence that using the ideas as a basis for policy prescriptions has led to overwhelmingly negative outcomes for the people of nations where the policies have been tried. Thus, they are "dead" in the sense that they have failed experimental testing, the same way a scientific hypothesis could be proclaimed "dead" if experimental results are not consistent with the predicted outcome.Furthermore, it is the very fact that numerous people still hold these ideas that makes his thesis thought provoking. The central point of this article is the paradox of experimentally "dead" ideas being kept "alive" by power hungry leaders and a desperate, historically ignorant citizenry. Ultimately, he is not engaging in any emotional manipulation by calling the ideas dead because his central argument is an appeal through logos, not pathos, in that he asks why people do not take into account the objective historical facts concerning past policies. His use of death metaphors is simply an accurate way to describe what our attitude should be toward objectively ineffective ideas.</comment>

<comment>Authoritative scientific experiments are designed to account for every possible foreseeable variable. History is not a rigorous study that produces ironclad, categorical policy results that are valid across all of time and space and it is ridiculous to treat it that way.Policies that work in one place and time often don't work in others. The assumption that one size really does fit all (or doesn't fit all) is a major driver of wasted spending and breath.The problem with using "objective historical facts" to judge past policies is that which facts are important varies dramatically between ideological frameworks. The "facts" may be objective, but it is borderline impossible for the observer to be, especially if the matter is complex and the "facts" require interpretation.</comment>

<comment>Let me paraphrase "You can't learn anything, because each situation is unique."  Yes, we should try communism another 500 times to see if it always ends up in mass political murder.</comment>

<comment>The shorter version of my post is "simplistic thinking is bad, and people who claim that the truth about something complex is simple and obvious are almost universally guilty of it".As H.L. Mencken would say: "For every complex problem, there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong."</comment>

<comment>There are hundreds of lessons that we could learn from the history of the Soviet Union, but the important ones can't be learned by looking at aggregate statistics.We also won't learn much if we mislabel the precious few elements in our sample set.</comment>

<comment>Personally, I think that Stalin and Mao's personalities had more to do with the brutality of their regimes than the ideological stances they claimed to hold.</comment>

<comment>And Cambodia, North Korea, Vietnam, Albania, East Germany, Poland...</comment>

<comment>Those are all good examples of countries where paying lip service to communism was a decent way to keep power, whether you practiced it or not. The US is a good example of a country where paying lip service to democracy is a decent way to keep power, whether you practice it or not.</comment>

<comment>To be clear, I fully understand that comparing historical analysis to scientific testing is somewhat hyperbolic, given the noted discrepancies in one's ability to control other variables, but it was simply an effort to convince "The Anti-Monitor" that the author's intent in writing this was more a call to for people to study history and try to draw lessons from the past than it was a an attempt at an indictment of specific philosophies. Of course, neither the author nor I believe that drawing conclusions is easy, simple, or even possible in all cases, but it should at least be attempted because as a policy is tried over and over again with a similar result it begins to approach the point where we should, at minimum, regard the given policy as more or less likely to work than expected by a person with no knowledge of history.</comment>

<comment>To give an example based on the point discussed above, whether or not you believe that any historically communist nation truly adhered to the principles of communism, and whether or not you believe that the United States is truly democratic, the fact remains that the average person in almost every reasonably democratic country throughout history has tended to be better off than the average person in any of the countries listed above by "developer31." To take this into account when considering the relative merits of communism and democracy is not simplistic. Rather, to neglect to do so would be absurd.</comment>

<comment>I agree that we should be trying to learn from history. I also agree that we should be learning at the policy/policy implementation level.Any new attempt to implement a policy that has failed should be accompanied by analysis showing how the new approach to implementation is different in a meaningful way that addresses the flaws of prior attempts.Of course, ANY policy should have a credible blueprint before implementation. Policies that have failed elsewhere or elsewhen just need a little extra.</comment>

<comment>Don't be facetious...the situation for young people in Europe as a whole (maybe outside of Germany, but I'm sure we can find decent areas in the US as well) is far worse than it is in the US.

(Either you're in such dire circumstances as to have to work when you're 16, or you're too stupid to get a high school diploma.) A quick google found me the link below, which put the worst state (Mississippi) at 22% for 20-24 year olds in 2012...that's still far better than much of Europe and I doubt the unemployment rate has gone up since 2012.http://www.governing.com/gov-d...</comment>

<comment>Youth unemployment was much worse in Europe when I lived there than it was in the US.  Nearly everybody under 30 in Italy lives at home because no one can afford a place, and next to nobody actually owns a home.  The taxes are insane and there are very, very few halfway decent jobs to go around.  It's not great here, but oh man, I'd much rather be 22 in the US than in Italy (or Spain, or Greece, or Portugal, or the UK...)</comment>

<comment>"The assumption that, in the age of globalization, a larger, longer, higher wall will deter migrants is deeply flawed as well."This sentence perfectly encapsulates the reason that most people no longer trust Western elites. What the hell does it even mean? At the end of the day globalization is just a new term for international trade and the exchange of information across national borders, which is a phenomenon that has existed throughout human history. Does  "globalization" somehow give illegal immigrants the power to fly over a border fence? Why is Japan able to preserve its policy of immigration restriction despite being a full participant in globalization?</comment>

<comment>It is a long swim to Japan, as opposed to merely crossing the tiny Rio Grande, or the long, long, unguarded border.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps, but the sheer arrogance of his assertion is what bothers me. The message is clearly that we live in a globalist world now, and so we have no choice but to accept free trade, mass immigration, multiculturalism, the destruction, of traditional forms of identity, the undermining of national borders, and every other policy that elite technocrats happen to prefer. The rabble may rebel from time to time, but such outcomes are inevitable. Except, of course, that they aren't and anyone who tells you they are is full of it.</comment>

<comment>His arrogance - intellectual or otherwise - is there to see for all who read up on his CV. I find it hilarious that this very author would write a piece about "ideological necrophilia" when his clinging to dead ideas - albeit not as long dead as some others - is the very definition of "ideological necrophilia".</comment>

<comment>You couldn't be more wrong, US has 50th highest suicide rate (tied with Uruguay). Sweden is 58th, Norway is 81th.  Maybe do some research before wasting everyone's time with your ignorance </comment>

<comment>And they are so open to illegal immigration there...</comment>

<comment>Philip, we have have (to paraphrase William F. Buckley) a segment of our population that is extreeemely casual about advancing their economic prospects.</comment>

<comment>Not for minority immigrants. Mobility among the 93% white people who share the same exact culture and religion is high, but just see how they are handling their immigrants. Immigrants to America have higher mobility than those perfect countries in Europe. The reason why they were stable so long is because they had strict limits on immigration.</comment>

<comment>A couple of thoughts:1) I've heard similar phrases in economics discourse--Paul Krugman often talks of "cockroach ideas" or "zombie ideas"--but " ideological necrophilia" has got to be the dumbest construction about this around.Necrophilia suggests that people like these ideas precisely because they are dead, as if there are groups of people who only revere ideas that have been disproven. (Maybe the Shining Path guerrillas were all flat-earthers until Maoism became discredited enough to become "hip" again.)Not only does the phrase not adequately describe what's going on, but it makes it easier not to engage with why those ideas persist. (Why do people support Trump? Because they're ideological necrophiliacs. There, we've identified it. Our job is done. We can all retire for the day.)2) It's striking to me that he singles out things that aren't even really ideas. Peronism is more of a brand than an idea, which is how neo-liberal Carlos Menem and the populist Kirchners both fit within its umbrella.3) The author asserts that European-style socialism leads to high unemployment, an idea of dubious viability itself. Perhaps all he's come up with is another name for confirmation bias.</comment>

<comment>Spot on about Peronism. In current day Argentina, it's a virtually meaningless label.</comment>

<comment>I'd like my 5 minutes back please.</comment>

<comment>Done.</comment>

<comment>Thanks!</comment>

<comment>I don't see the value in your conceptIdeas don't die, they just rise and fall in popularity. For example, Maoism is largely  an extension of the agrarianism that was practiced in China starting around the 16th century, where it worked relatively well. Maoism failed because it incorporated western ideas like absolute economic equality, and could not compete in an industrialized world.Trump's wall doesnt fit in your idea either. Your wall is poorly enforced and your country has no political and moral will to maintain its sovereignty. For a country of your wealth, military or militia on the border would secure it very easily. So it's not a failed idea, it's an untried oneOn the other side, socialism could work as long as it remains purely a social policy, and not an economic or governing one. It already does in most Asian countries. Its excesses come from people who use socialism as a crutch for compassion, and those people can simply be ignored</comment>

<comment>Socialism is purely an economic idea. It's even in the definition: "Socialism is a range of social and economic systems characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production".Did you mean to say libertarianism for the cultural component and democracy for the political component?</comment>

<comment>We have our own maoists in black lives matter.  Lucky us.</comment>

<comment>Feel the fear.</comment>

<comment>Clever phrase, ideological necrophilia. Your point that, "There are many reasons why bad ideas endure, but perhaps the most important is people’s need to believe in a leader amid rapid change" is a warning that should be well-heeded.Apart from everything else destabilizing the world, accelerating automation WILL cause massive technological unemployment in the 2020's and beyond. If we don't get ahead of this now, by exploring truly new solutions, there will be a risk of Juan Peron-like figures emerging in countries whose residents crave a strong leader.Peron led Argentina from prosperity to third world status. Many ugly things happened in the process.</comment>

<comment>If we have free markets, fewer regulations, and lower taxes, accelerating automation will be a blessing and not a curse.</comment>

<comment>Mr Naim would be correct about Sen Sanders if he were able to implement his program w/o the changes in the tax code that would pay for the programs. Instead he has chosen to be an idiot afraid of losing his sinecure in our current political system. Mr Naim could argue the following information can not occur in the current political environment but then he would have to explain the Clinton's face the same problem for a much lesser program that make no pretense of unrigging the system.I suggest he read the section of his website where Sen Sanders explains this, https://berniesanders.com/issu....Here he could make a argument the numbers don't work out not won't work at all. The problem of what happens after an object is observed is the operating principle here.  Either new tax proposals taking money out of the system occur or the income goes down as people no longer use these tactics so it doesn't produce as much.This failure is why both Trump and Sanders are such threats to hacks like Mr Naim. To change the system means they are out of work protecting the Emperors new clothes.</comment>

<comment>This phrase "giving them to politically appointed operatives; allowing government spending and indebtedness to skyrocket; promoting consumer spending through unsustainable handouts, subsidies, and credits;" pretty much describes the current US also</comment>

<comment>"Bernie Sanders’s attraction to massive, government-centered programs places him squarely among populists who dismiss the need to maintain fiscal balances and end up with unsustainable government budget deficits..."It seems unfair to single out Sanders when Trump and Rubio have both put forward fiscal proposals that are even more ruinous than Sanders'.  Cruz and Clinton have been remarkably non specific so far, so we can only guess at how aggressively they'd pretend to tackle the deficit, but neither of them has indicated a commitment to fiscal conservatism.Permanent deficit spending ought to be a dead idea, but it's not dead, and won't die any time soon, because it's so politically useful.</comment>

<comment>America is a nation with it's collective head up its @ss. Trump promises, and will, correct that problem. Will he solve all the others - no, but do we need this cleansing - yes.</comment>

<comment>After Trump  roto-roots the national colon, I hope he gives himself an enema and disappears.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Naim,The folks with the biggest "ideological necrophilia" were economists, many of them your good friends who clung to the view that deregulated financial markets most efficiently intermediated. This is notwithstanding more than three decades of evidence of boom and bust.</comment>

<comment>Naím still promotes the deeply unpopular neoliberal reforms forcefully enacted in Venezuela in 1989 while he served as Minister of Trade under a government that killed up to 3000 civilians during the infamous 'Caracazo'.</comment>

<comment>Alright, let's build a wall, a beautiful wall, a monument, like the  Great Wall of China. Let it be a tourist attraction that people could walk upon and survey the landscapes of two great countries. I'm back in my "Age of Empires" mode, and building monuments was a great civilization building strategy.</comment>

<comment>The saving grace for America is that a good proportion of these wild ideas are simply lies made in order to get elected.  Obama promised in 2008 to visit North Korea and Iran.  Thank goodness he was lying.Further, the obstructionist Congress plays a good role in cutting back the wildness of the fool in the White House.</comment>

<comment>I highly doubt that Obama made that promise.  Cite?(I'd believe that he said something like, if conditions were right, if the other side were serious about negotiation and change, he would not rule out visiting.  Very different.)</comment>

<comment>" He and his imitators stoked nationalism, made promises that were impossible to keep, exploited wedge issues along racial, ethnic, or religious lines, and distributed resources in the name of the poor in ways that in the long run made everyone poorer."yep. yet progressive still exist and are trying to do the same to the USA</comment>

<comment>Moises Naím, the most worthless writer in the history of the Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>Dead ideas which have failed time and time again - such as those that produced Detroit, Memphis, Baltimore and countless crime ridden zones.   Ideas like mass immigration of different peoples will be economically beneficial, when they only cause strife and partition in the long term.  Ideas like a hostile minority can seduce or guilt a majority, and not have blowback.</comment>

<comment>You were doing OK until the completely pointless lying about Bernie Sanders.  Your comparison lacks scope, and pretends that capitalism does not also have practical limitations when stretched to extremes.Bernie Sanders is not proposing that government take over the means of production, nor is he suggesting that things be priced under their market value.  He is saying that unregulated capitalism is similar to cancer, which will take whatever it can get even if it kills the host - which is no way to run a country because it favors short term gain over long term profit and prosperity.Ever read the Constitution?  Remember that of the people, for the people, and the common welfare part?  I don't remember reading anything about historically high levels of income inequality being a good thing.You should be ashamed of this hit piece in the guise of journalism.</comment>

<comment>To claim that Sanders (or Obama) is not a Socialist because he does not propose that the government take over the means of production when he accomplishes the same by regulating to the point of controlling it is a distinction without a difference. Put it this way: I would not describe either as a promoter of free markets (the only systems that generates wealth). Either way it's ideological necrophilia."Promot[ing] the GENERAL welfare" means that actions taken by the government should not favor one group over another. Like Pennsylvanians over Marylanders.The phrase "of the people, by the people and for the people" is from the Gettysburg Address, but refers to the Declaration of Independence.As far as economic inequality, Warren Buffett is worth $61.8 billion dollars. If he were worth $161.8 billion, how would that affect you or me? We could all go back to being hunter-gatherers I suppose, then we'd all be equal but I wouldn't like it too much. In a sophisticated economy like ours you're going to have inequality. No problem. The problem is people who are so reckless in their choices that the sabotage their own futures. If you finish school, get married, and then have children, in that order, you practically can't fail.</comment>

<comment>Sophistry in defense of the status quo.What's with the assumption that political candidates and their followers are all literalists? You need to take a hint from the Amazing Kreskin: the more educated a person the easier they are to trick. Trump's supporters want action on an economy they feel is leaving them behind. The vast bulk of his supporters understand building a Great Wall of the Southwest and making Mexico pay for it is a rallying cry for change. Free tuition at all public colleges? How about funding colleges like we used to: where a summer job and 10-20 hours of work during school would actually pay for a state school?And while Cruz is an actual nutball, the problem with carpet bombing is bombing. The utter destruction of Dacia by the Romans didn't exactly leave Trajan or his successors with a Dacian problem, the Carib Indians aren't exactly a problem in the USVI or Puerto Rico and the Mongols proved a willingness to wipe clean the earth made the next group to oppose them more flexible in their attitude.</comment>

<comment>Well, this article describes Barack's selection, election, and dereliction of duty to a tee.</comment>

<comment>Ideological necrophilia and you go for Trump and not Sanders?</comment>

<comment>I see plenty of examples in the world for the some forms of political failure.  Communism and Socialism provide plenty of examples, some listed here.I didn't see an example, nor can I think of one in history, where attempting border controls failed to have some effect on immigration.  Japan provides a strong counter example   I suspect the Republican establishment has created Trump over this one issue and their unwillingness to address it despite their members' strong opinions.  No one believes, perhaps correctly, that anyone else will do anything about it.</comment>

<comment>jajajaja this article is as funny as they get. Argentina during Peron's last government (1973-1974) achieved it's economic peak. The real reason of the economic decline? The neocon dictatorship that followed, that killed 30,000 people and destroyed the economy so the elites could make thousands of millions. The accusations of Venezuela "forget" that oil prices had a catastrophic fall. Venezuela's non-necrophilic opossition has exactly the same ideas that chavists, with one important difference: instead of the money going to chavez and friends, it would go to transnational companies. So, is populism the cure to all our problems? No, but only the truth about what happened and happens will defeat populism.</comment>

<comment>The 'Shock Jock' of print.</comment>

<comment>I vehemently disagree with this writer. Not every failed idea is a dead idea that deserves to be buried. If that were the case, many scientific inventions would not have come about. An idea failed mostly because it was poorly understood, communicated, tested and implemented. Poor leadership is always the culprit. But that shouldn't preclude its revival under new and different circumstances.This writer cites Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution in China as an example of a dead idea that must be buried. I disagree. The Cultural Revolution was conceived to transition post-WWII China from centuries of feudalism to modernism. It fell short NOT because the idea of Cultural Revolution was flawed but because it was infused with Marxist economics, poor leadership and planning, thus yielding negative outcomes. Despite its ubiquitous skyscrapers and fantastic GDP, China today is still feudal - culturally. In my view, China still needs a Cultural Revolution - albeit in a different form. And such thinking is by no means 'ideological necrophilia.'</comment>

<comment>This would explain the continuing popularity of neoliberalism among the political and financial elite here and elsewhere despite it's spectacular failure for working people everywhere since 1980, and with emphasis since 2008.  But then the 1% and their political and media representatives are doing quite well because of it, so "failure" is a matter of class perspective.</comment>

<comment>This article assumes that Trump and Sanders actually believe what they're saying, and that their followers actually care. In actual fact they're both just middle fingers aimed at the Western clerisy and establishment class by the abused, neglected and maligned plebs.</comment>

<comment>Walls and increase border enforcement do indeed curb illegal immigration, despite what the author says.We've built up extensive fencing up to 30% now is fenced/walled, and stepped up interdiction, and the results have been good: illegal crossings are indeed down overall despite the latest surge of unaccompanied children. Putting aside where you stand on this, it has saved lives.More can be done and we have to deal with visa overstays which are a big issues, but even there, the lax "day visa's" and better fingerprinting and tracking are cutting it down a bit.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps the author has never visited the US-Mexican border if he claims fences and walls have been tried and have failed. Having grown-up and lived most of my life near this border I know, as would anyone who had done 10 minutes worth of research, that other than very short stretches, the border is largely open, or has only feeble barriers. Just do a web search and you can find innumerable pictures where a fence just stops, where a river  that goes dry in the summer is the barrier, or where one single fence about 10 feet high and easily scalable exists with no one to monitor things.Also, the author apparently never bothered to look at border barriers elsewhere in the world, especially those that have had significant effects in reducing migration or violence.To make an analogy between the failures of socialism which have a 100 year track record of failure nearly everywhere, and a border barrier which has never been fully tried, is just sloppy, idoelogically motivated laziness.</comment>

<comment>Equating assuming an infinite money supply to building a physical wall.  Not very good choice.  If you use those "few keystrokes" to gather some information you will find that there are 100s of miles US-Mexico border with no barrier - basically ~20% of the border is fenced.  There are good reasons not to build such a barrier, but not because it wouldn't work to keep out immigrants.  If, for example, President Obama had said some of the reasons not to build a fence, Trump wouldn't have as good an argument.  Instead he lied and said there was already a fence and fences just don't work.  And members of the press said he was right, when they knew he was wrong, and said anyone who doesn't believe them listens to Fox News.  I'm not using this example because I care about the border with Mexico, but because it illustrates the level of dishonesty that supports 'dead ideas'.  The political left in the US was singing the praises of Stalin's Soviet worker's paradise for years after the Gulag Archipelago was written.  That wasn't because they were dumb - many were quite clever - but because they were willing to protect cherished untruth.  A few years ago Venezuela was the latest worker's paradise, although now that Chavez is dead people feel more free to criticize, so now that distinction goes to Scandinavia.  In Scandinavia it is already common knowledge that what is being praised went to far and almost destroyed the economies which they had built by more free-market based societies.  That doesn't mean they should throw out all the benefits that their more egalitarian innovations have afforded, but they know those egalitarian innovations are luxuries, not the source of the economies that allow them to afford them.And the better choice for illustrating bipartisan ideological necrophilia - the effectiveness of military action for social change.  It brings together some of the most left-wing internationalists and right-wing neo-cons.  Should have spent more time there.</comment>

<comment>A poorly conceived story. Comparing Trump's ideas to the  catastrophes of Mao, Peron, et al without much of an attempt to define a logical connection between them exposes this story for what it is: a run of the mill hit piece. Nice try.You want to see ideological necrophilia? Just look at the throbbing mass of corruption infesting D.C. right now. That's explains Trump. Trump is not the phoenix that arises from the ashes. We haven't got there yet. Trump is the consuming fire. Sometimes you need to set a fire to burn out all the roaches and rats. Then something good can grow anew. let's hope.</comment>

<comment>You want to see ideological necrophilia, consider the widespread reverence for the concept of Warfare.In my observation, Warfare seems to get the most credence from two types of people: those who haven't experienced even the most remote impact from it, for whom it exists as an abstract fantasy, a mind cartoon; and those who have been traumatized by its ghastly effects to the point that violence and vengeance consumes them as an obsession.</comment>

<comment>Warfare can only be revered by those who are ignorant of its consequences.  Those of us who have been to war do not revere or even like it.  It just must be. The faster it is over with so our children must not endure it, the better.Those who are traumatized cannot 'revere' it as it is consuming their mind in negative ways.Children and moral cowards can revere war, but not war fighters.  Except for George C. Scott in Patton, you'll never hear a real Soldier say he 'reveres' war.</comment>

<comment>"Ideological Necrophilia", the lefts love affair with oblamer and lib/socialism.If Comrade Sanders (you know, that old communist white guy) gets elected, the leftwill probably end up with the chance to practice literal necrophilia on the corpse.  You people do go in for those weird sort of things.</comment>

<comment>Apparently the author believes in his own idea of "ideological Necrophilia" because his screed was full of it.</comment>

<comment>Why does "Hot Air" link to so many of these idiotic "The Atlantic" articles? To prove how dumb the Atlantic editors are?</comment>

<comment>When people say we need to raise taxes or tax the rich more it is clear that they have note seen the numbers.  Spending is the problem!!!Taxes Spending and % Change Last 3 presidents (in trillion $$):Clinton   12.3   12.7Busch    17.1   19.2  38.7%  51.0%Obama   21.5   28.9  25.4% 50.5%</comment>

<comment>Those ideas persist because they speak to deeply rooted problems which conventional policies don't seem to address well. Severe inequality and violence between the rich and the rural poor persist in a lot of places, and Maoism seems to offer a solution.Paul Krugman has written a lot about zombie ideas like the Laffer curve and tax cuts paying for themselves, it's the same thing in reverse -- tax cuts are the desired policy, and a justification for why this policy fits the current situation must be created.</comment>

<comment>This article is ideologically troubling to me. To declare that "dead" ideas should remain dead suggests that there are ideas that are unacceptable to think. Makes me think of the Nazis. But maybe because the last book I read was The Book Thief. Anyway, IMO ideas should never be declared dead. There is always value in raising them again, discussing why they were dismissed / discredited, and questioning if they have any more value now than they did at that time. In that vein, I would counter the term "Ideological Necrophilia" with the term "Unrelenting Pedagogy"</comment>

<comment>Another example is "trickle-down economics."  Yet, people still argue for it even though its failure is clear.</comment>

<comment>Vote for the lying crook, it is important.</comment>

<comment>Nearly a hundred years ago essayist and social critic H. L. Mencken noted a peculiar barbaric tendency in Americans to prefer architecture that was not only not harmonious, but in fact hideous and offensive. There was enough education and culture in even the least-favored districts, he noted, to distinguish and culture beauty. Americans simply did not bother so doing. So they built wretched stilted row houses along an Appalachian ridge, or put a yellow penthouse on top of a hulking stadium "whose appearance," he wrote, "was exactly like that of a fat woman with a black eye." He called this America's "libido for the ugly," and it certainly has been a major feature of American mass architecture since then, from Levittown's oppressive sameness to the hulking affronts of Frank Geary.We see something of this tendency now in American politics, an urge toward not just failed policies, but failed policies that were deliberately murderous, genocidal, or simply ruinous. This irrational 'libido for failure' shows itself in the prominent resurrected racial hate and urge to genocide that characterized the antebellum South and its mirror image, the Jim Crow South. We find it in the insistence that 'trickle-down' economics weren't given a fair chance, that they would work only if people didn't insist the rich pay taxes. And of course we find it in the return of Nativism, once safely dead as immigrants added to America's wealth and talents. Now, it seems, it's back as fiercely as it was in the days of Tammany Hall and the Five Points.It's not that Americans don't know better. It's that they don't seem to care, and want the extreme for nothing more or less than its contrast with elements of American civilization that they have learned to despise -- politeness, tolerance, and the American energy for finding new solutions. A lot of people badly want to be offensive, to the point where others are as offended as they are. They want to be intolerant as they see Al Qaeda and Daesh being intolerant, and with the same apparent immunity to extinction from airstrikes. These old solutions required a great deal of violence and blood, and this, they think, they would prefer to anything else in the way of finding a way through. Better a Clevon Bundy having his cattle graze on public lands and threatening Federal agents than to require adherence to the law, instead of on one's personal armament and like-minded friends. They already have the solutions, they seem to feel, no matter how badly they turned out before. So they hold up the Confederacy and the Reagan Revolution as examples of when the country was better off, not oblivious to the result but actually wanting more of the same until they and the country choke on it. They don't feel they're destroying liberty and the 'last best hope of mankind.' They feel they themselves are that hope, and their efforts to punish and kill others or at least inconvenience them the way this gets done.Call it America's 'libido for failure.' More and more people want someone like Trump as President not because they don't see his policies and his personal politics as degrading and destructive; they want him in there because they WANT degradation and destruction. They WANT racial terror and religious conflict and the anonymity of bombings and mass shootings, because it feeds a deep visceral need in them to see all the things they hate -- clean shirts, wiping your nose with a tissue not your sleeve, eating your vegetables before you get ice cream -- wiped out in a paroxysm of sheer puerile explosive tantrums. The more dead, the more dispossessed, the more cast out of their homes and their families destroyed, the better they like it. Because they hate civilization more than anything else in the world, and want it all torn down around them so they can stand free, with their automatic weapons, the heroes of their own personal 'Walking Dead' or 'Fallout' video game. Only it would be real, and they imagine they'll like it better.And they won't believe it isn't until they make the world run with blood and fire and find it's not at all what they imagined. But by then, nobody will be left to rebuild the things they hate, so it'll be all right, they guess. There can be no bad end to the world, so long as they can help take it apart.</comment>
