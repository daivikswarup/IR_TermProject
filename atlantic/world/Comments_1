<comment>Good article.  If I could quibble, it might have been good to include more hard numbers: the number of annual murders (23,000 in a country of 30M), the official vs unofficial inflation rate (real inflation is > 50%); official vs unofficial currency trading levels (real currency is a fraction of the "official" currency peg) and annual oil production metrics (declining due to corruption and lack of investment).While we are not Venezuela, it is useful to look at that country as a cautionary tale on redistribution-a-nomics. In short, what Chavez did was to loot the oil industry of both profits and capital investment and use those funds to purchase the political support of poor people. It "worked" (in terms of political popularity) for over a decade, especially when oil production and oil prices remained elevated and Chavez himself was able to weave his strange spell over his people.The problem is that Venezuela's oil (unlike Saudi Arabia's) is sludgy and hard to extract. Even if they started reinvesting today, it would take years to arrest the decline in their only cash crop.  And the countries economy is uncompetitive outside of the production of commodities.When the inevitable decline set in, the government continued to devalue the currency and sought to blame the Yanquis and/or the dwindling pool of producers.I would actually like to read an honest take from Krugman on Venezuela - as they have followed his general advice regarding money printing and devaluation.The long and short of it is this - only an economic system as bad as Chavez-a-nomics could wreck an economy with the oil resources that Venezuela has.</comment>

<comment>I agree. you have no idea of the lefthist articles I've read in Italy defending maduro's violence.some data about homicides in the years http://imgur.com/1YjMB63</comment>

<comment>Forgive me, but isn't Italy's far left essentially insane? I'm thinking Red Brigades and whatnot here.</comment>

<comment>yes, those are insane, but I'm talking about major newspapers that write about peace, rights and public services while defending maduro's actions. I can't believe the hypocrisy I'm reading these days.</comment>

<comment>Well, that's effed. But then, I always got shunned at all the Little Red Book readings for not being on the Chavezista train.</comment>

<comment>You mean Chavista. I would be proud of that!</comment>

<comment>Oh, I am. I have an uncle who won't talk to me anymore because of it.</comment>

<comment>:( Let's hope he'll come back to his senses sometime soon!</comment>

<comment>The Italian press is pretty much awful across the board. There are some bright spots but I wouldn't take any of what you're reading too seriously. It's bad to your health in the long run.</comment>

<comment>Because real newspapers aren't being fooled by the BS propaganda war being fought by Miami-based fascists on Facebook and Twitter.</comment>

<comment>that's true, but I've only compared what I read on the italian leftist newspapers with all the info I've been getting from my family in san cristobal, and it's pretty grotesque.</comment>

<comment>You keep using that word "fascist"; I do not think it means what you think it means.</comment>

<comment>I agree! As a daughter and granddaughter of people who suffered under and directly fought actual fascists, I find the term, as it is being used here, irresponsible and insulting.</comment>

<comment>The Red Bridgades in Italy have largely quiet since the 80s. In general, the far-left/outright Commies in Italy and in Europe are like their far-right counterparts. They sometimes win provincial elections and a few seats in Parliament, as in one or two, but never enough for it to be worthwile. </comment>

<comment>Maybe that kind of media story can help to explain what really baffles me about this article.  Which is that half of Venezuelans do not support the government.  So . . . half do?  Despite all the misgoverning the article details?I feel like this has missed the "man bites dog" story.  Public disapproval of an incompetent and repressive regime is dog-bites-man.  But how on earth does it still manage to have 50% support?!</comment>

<comment>Venezuela just had municipal and regional elections two months ago. PSUV won by 10 percentage points across the country. That's significantly more than half, far more than the margin in any US election. When should the government be forced to resign? 60%? 55%? 51% (which is what Obama got in the last election). And when the left wins the next election (which they would), should that government be forced to resign too?The fact is these protests are being carried out by far less than 50% of the country. You really expect the world to believe that the people changed their minds this much in 2 months?</comment>

<comment>And if you think that the elections in Venezuela aren't stacked or rigged against the opposition you are sadly mistaken!</comment>

<comment>Venezuelan elections are, across the board, rated cleaner and fairer than US elections even by the Carter Center. In fact, they assessed the Venezuelan electoral system as "one of the best in the world". You don´t actually know what you´re talking about, do you?</comment>

<comment>I'm Venezuelan, I vote there. Elections ARE rigged, where did you hear the electoral system is one of the best? in Cuba?, from Fidel? or maybe Chavez, I remember he said it...a thousand times but it's not true. Chavez won ONCE, the rest of the elections were never "cleaned" and no one voted for Maduro, not even chavistas. SO you ARE the one who doesn't know what's talking about.</comment>

<comment>From Fidel? No, genius. From those communist sympathizers at the Carter Center. The fact that you've never heard of it only proves your another Miami poseur trying to pass herself off as Venezuelan. You should probably let them know about all the evidence of fraud you found because they didn't find any.</comment>

<comment>Liz, the Carter Center rated the elections process as very clean.  One might look at the FDA's report for some problems not cited by the Carter Center.  http://www.slideshare.net/FDAd...</comment>

<comment>Bogus,even the opposition candidates are bared from the media such as Global Vision which was taken over by the government there.The regime makes sure all obstacles are stacked against them and there is no way in the future that the current regime in Venezuela will allow any changes at all other than their grip on power!</comment>

<comment>Globovision was not taken over by the government. If you're going to try and pass yourself off as an expert, you should at least know the name of the network, genius. The private media has the overwhelming market share of viewers in Venezuela and opposition candidates have no problem getting airtime. Anyone who has ever turned on a television knows that. You, clearly, have never been to Venezuela. You shouldn't repeat talking points that you never bothered to investigate yourself. That makes you a useful idiot. Here, educate yourself.http://www.cartercenter.org/ne...</comment>

<comment>Excuse me but i have been to Venezuela though not recently.Global Vision has been taken over by special interest group partial to the regime there and the opposition has no voice any longer in the media there.If you were a true patriot i would be very concerned with the  Cuban regimes ever growing influence.However,i am sure you only care about any so called CIA bogus charges and blaming everything on the "Yanques"!</comment>

<comment>Global Vision? Who is that? There is a network in Venezuela called Globovision. If you want to pass yourself off as an expert, you should at least know the name of the network you are claiming to know about. Do you even speak Spanish, gringo?As for "true patriot", patriot to what? To your country? Why would any ethical human being back your empire built on slavery, genocide, racism and imperialism? You have been an enemy to democracy across Latin America for over a century. You've overthrown more democracies and installed more murderous dictatorships than any empire in history. The Soviets would blush at your heartless actions. Am I supposed to believe your gringo terror story that an impoverished nation of 11 million people is taking over South America? Go home gringo. Nobody has more blood on their hands than you do and we aren't your backyard.</comment>

<comment>If the USA is so bad then how come so many Latin Americans are still  trying to come here to live?Life has become unbearable in your socialist paradise and all you try to do is blame it on the "gringos".From your rantings it is obvious you are nothing more than just another stooge  for the thugs in charge there.There is no real logic in reasoning with a twisted mindset as yours.Your only resolve is to blame the big bad "Yanques" for all your ills.You are one pathetic excuse for a human being and soon you will be on the outside looking in there.Perhaps you can join your comrades in that democratic haven Cuba before they crumble also!  Yes the U.S. has it's faults and i for one consider VULTURE capitalism a real  threat here but at least i will admit it.Unlike your acting as if the current regime in Venezuela is is without any real faults and it is all some kind of imperialists plot!</comment>

<comment>"If the USA is so bad then how come so many Latin Americans are still  trying to come here to live?"If the USA is so great, why does the US have the largest expat population on the planet? See why your logic has no basis in this argument?"Life has become unbearable in your socialist paradise and all you try to do is blame it on the "gringos"."My country has a negative emigration rate (not to mention a shitload of gringos moving here every year). I don't think you know what you're talking about. You should probably limit your arguments to the facts because you know nothing about me."From your rantings it is obvious you are nothing more than just another stooge  for the thugs in charge there."Obvious to a gringo that has never been here, has no idea what is happening here, and still refuses to admit that his country has been the greatest enemy of democracy on the continent? Wow. That really hurts."There is no real logic in reasoning with a twisted mindset as yours."There is plenty of logic, based on real data and real world experience. You, on the other hand, try to pass yourself off as an expert on Global Vision."Your only resolve is to blame the big bad "Yanques" for all your ills."Really? What are all my ills and when did I blame the Yanquis for them (notice how you misspelled that, Mr. Expert?)."You are one pathetic excuse for a human being and soon you will be on the outside looking in there."Sure thing, Nostradamus. That's what your argument has boiled down to, convincing the readers that you can see into the future. What a loser. I'm supposed to fear the predictions of a man who has continuously revealed he has no idea what he's talking about. Scary."Perhaps you can join your comrades in that democratic haven Cuba before they crumble also!"Let us know when your country has a lower infant mortality rate, higher literacy rate or longer life expectancy than Cuba. I'm sure you liked it better when it was a mafia controlled brothel, but that's neither here nor there. You're closer to Cuban than I am, gringo."Yes the U.S. has it's faults and i for one consider VULTURE capitalism a real  threat here but at least i will admit it."What does that have to do with this discussion?"Unlike your acting as if the current regime in Venezuela is is without any real faults and it is all some kind of imperialists plot!"The fact that the US has been financially and supporting the groups that have sought to violently overthrow the democratically-elected government of Venezuela for the past 12 year is definitely a plot and is not in question. You're welcome to review USAid's records to see who they're funding. You're welcome to review the dozens of trips to the US State Department by Leopoldo Lopez and his long-time close relationship with David Patreus since he was in university. If it's a plot hatched by imperialists, it's an imperialist plot. That's just common sense.However, I challenge you to prove that I have ever acted as if the current regime in Venezuela is without fault. That's a pathetic argument that is laughable to anyone who knows me. You, however, do not know me which is why your arguments fail so miserably. You're a gringo with an opinion, just like every other gringo, just like every other person on the planet. Strangely, it's only gringos who not only feel entitled to their opinions, they feel entitled to their own facts. You claim the moral authority to tell the rest of us how to live, who should govern us, and how our economies should be organized. I wonder how you will feel when the Chinese start doing the same to you. Will you finally understand that your life is no more important than ours? Will you finally realize that you have undermined democracy in our region for 2 centuries so that you could get cheap oil and bananas, yet still call yourselves champions of democracy? Will you finally realize that the blood on your hands not only means you have no moral authority, but that you should STFU?I doubt it. One thing gringos never do is admit they're wrong. That's still considered a weakness in your savage culture. Ask any US politician.</comment>

<comment>Hey Tonto,all i am hearing from you are your ridiculous rants.In fact you sound not only full of it but desperate also.Again,i have been to Venezuela!You are rather amusing actually.You should be on Radio Habana!</comment>

<comment>I presented you a long series of verifiable facts and all you hear is what you want to hear. Typical gringo. The fact that you went chasing teenage prostitutes on vacation in Venezuela does not change objective reality, gringo. Feel free to reply when you have any objective facts to dispute what I've already presented. Otherwise, STFU.</comment>

<comment>See,all you have are slanders and innuendo's.Kock yourself out Tonto!</comment>

<comment>We get it. You can't dispute any of the MANY facts I have presented so instead you resort to silly comments devoid of any substance. It's clear you are neither capable of presenting a factual argument or admitting defeat. That says a lot about your command of this subject, but it says even more about your moral fiber. The funny part is, you're making a fool of yourself in a public forum and you keep making it worse.BTW, it's pretty clear you don't know the definition of "slander" or "innuendo".This is the part where you walk away in defeat.You're going to reply anyway, I'm sure. You can't help yourself.</comment>

<comment>No Tonto you don't get it.How are those"collectivos and their "social cleansing" working out?I bet you look cute in your red beret.Buenos noches mi pequeno asesino de titeres!</comment>

<comment>How are those landowners and their dozens of assassinations of peasant farmers working out? What's the count over the past year? Something like 50? How many people have been killed by the colectivos (btw, you spelled that one wrong, too)? More than none?The facts just proved you wrong again. Quick, change the subject!Social cleansing!! LOL! A guy in the country with the largest prison population on the planet is trying to preach about social cleansing. That's rich. Protesting mobs just set 50 buses on fire, killed over a dozen people, burned down half a dozen government buildings, hijacked delivery trucks, sabotaged the electrical grid and set up burning barricades across the country. 30 have been arrested. Occupy protestors set up tents on sidewalks. 7,000 were arrested. Social cleansing indeed.You're too stupid to realize you're outclassed and too stubborn to stop replying. It's a good thing you were born in a rich country. You wouldn't be qualified to plow a field down here with that level of stupid. You should just count your blessings and STFU. But again, you're too stupid to do that so you'll keep replying.BTW, it's "buenas noches", genius. Tell me more about Latin America, Mr. Danger. </comment>

<comment>My little puppet crusader is so full of it but i admire your spunk if it weren't so twisted.</comment>

<comment>In other words, you cannot dispute a single fact I've presented to you, you don't actually have any facts to support your position, but you won't let that in any way affect your opinion.</comment>

<comment>Are you trying to convince me or yourself now?Stop it por favor,you are starting to turn me on in a strange way now little puppet crusader.;-(</comment>

<comment>We get it. You can't argue facts so make quips in a lame attempt to distract the readers from your many attempts at diversion.The funny thing is you think it's working. You're losing the argument on every point but you keep replying. The best thing you could do for yourself right now is walk away and in a few days everyone will have forgotten what a moron you are and you can make a fool of yourself in another thread somewhere.</comment>

<comment>Facts?You call your blatant rants facts?They aren't even close to worth replying to and no matter your black/white world is absurd and no matter what i say you would only try to twist and deny, my little puppet crusader!</comment>

<comment>They aren't worth replying to but you reply to every comment.You aren't fooling anyone.</comment>

<comment>And you think you are?Give it a rest,you are sounding so desperate and insecure.Especially your so called "facts".Anyone with even half a brain can see right through your rambling non sense.You and your "comrades" are all sad clowns indeed.Venezuela is sinking into the abyss and all you can do is blame the mess there on the big bad Yankees instead of taking some responsibility yourselves but i expect nothing less from such  cerdo ecabezada cronies!  Now i walk away from ridiculous accusations and endless rants.Have a nice life!</comment>

<comment>There you go again. Not worth replying to but you keep replying. Face it. You don't have any facts to support your argument and you don't have any argument to dispute the facts. You're just a blowhard gringo who can't admit he's repeatedly commenting on a subject he knows nothing about.Yes, walk away because you're been embarrassed publicly for long enough. Anyone reading this thread realizes you should have walked away in defeat a long time ago.</comment>

<comment>Pointing out atrocities of any country, any faction, does not prove that Maduro is competent, nor does it mean that the purely socialist ideology is beneficial.  All political groups, all religious groups, have been guilty of atrocities.  Possessing a particular ideology that hopes to be pure and good does not make it pure and good.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? Did you mean to post that in this thread? What does it have to do with the discussion currently underway?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I meant to post it here.  What it means is this:  you are pointing out the atrocities of the U.S. as if this somehow validates any of your arguments  that are pro-government of  Venezuela.  There are plenty of good people here in the U.S.  You called our culture savage.  Please find a culture, or a religion, that has not been guilty of some atrocity.  Using guilt of atrocity as an argument to support the Bolivarian Revolution makes no sense at all.</comment>

<comment>Pointing out that rich landowners have been assassinating peasants with impunity in Venezuela is pointing out the atrocities of the US.It´s clear you don´t take the time to read what you reply to before you reply. I can´t figure out what you think you´re accomplishing other than looking like a fool in public.</comment>

<comment>Verifiable facts, Faulkner? Chasing teenage . . . . who? What country are you from, again?</comment>

<comment>Who are you and what do you have to do with this conversation?</comment>

<comment>Answer the questions, kindly.</comment>

<comment>Answer mine.</comment>

<comment>I am from a land where cowards get called out. You've changed the subject to evade the question before you. You therefore are one, but not if you will reply to my original query in good faith. In which case I'll be good on yours, tit for tat.</comment>
