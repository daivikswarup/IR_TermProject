<comment>This focus on labels is silly.  "Who is part of the Establishment?"  "Who is the true Progressive?"Who cares?The question is who has policy ideas that will help our nation, and who has the courage and acumen to implement them.  Let's not waste time on nonsense.  Yes, politicians are always part of the establishment.  That is what the establishment is.</comment>

<comment>Hillary saying that she isn't part of the Establishment resembles Mitt's 2012 claim to have been a severely conservative governor. Friedersdorf's bafflement over understandable primary season white lies baffles me.</comment>

<comment>Well said</comment>

<comment>Well said,  too.</comment>

<comment>That sounds cool as a slogan and everything but have you realized that perhaps those labels might reflect policy positions?</comment>

<comment>Such as?  Sarah Palin said she was "all maverickey."  Was that a policy position?</comment>

<comment>So you think self labels by Sarah Palin are relevant? How? Not all labels reflect policy but certainly some do, right?</comment>

<comment>Reading is not your strong suit, that is for sure.  No, I don't think labels are relevant at all.  See my initial post.   I was poking fun at you.  You seem to be taking something very seriously, but frankly, I don't know what.  You seem hell bent on establishing that you are WAY, WAY OUT THERE.I would invite you (again) to try to clarify, but I don't think you're able.  So instead, I'll just politely say goodbye and fare thee well.  You can play troll-fool with someone else.</comment>

<comment>Why are you so upset? You don't think "labels" are important. OK we get it. That's awesome. But guess what, language matters. Words matter. They can decieve or tell the truth. That's a fact. Whether you agree is irrelevant.</comment>

<comment> Nonsense does not upset me.  Nor do you.  You are inconsequential, not even a flea.I think you are engaging in a defense mechanism called projection, where you impose your own feelings on third parties.Words do matter.  Communication requires we use words in ways that convey meaning.  You have failed at this, but it does not upset me.  The world is full of incompetence; you have plenty of company.</comment>

<comment>You sure seem upset. I understand that you want to lash out. You're offended because you said something terribly stupid and you don't want to lose face. But in reacting the way  you have you just enforce what I've known. Put it on a bumper sticker and get other imbeciles to put it on their VWs if it makes you feel better about yourself.</comment>

<comment>You are a very silly man, but boring, and not perceptive in the slightest.</comment>

<comment>Is that it? That's the limit of your intelligence and creativity. No wonder simplistic slogans is all you're capable of.</comment>

<comment>Not a very skilled troll.</comment>

<comment>Still mad? I make fools really mad.</comment>

<comment>Never mad.  Not in the least.Sorry though, for the way in which you've made a fool of yourself and continue to do so.  You just can't stop, can you?Can't wait to see what you will say next.EDIT:  Thank you for proving my point.  Goodbye fool.</comment>

<comment>Yep, you're very mad. The bigger the imbecile, the madder they get at me.</comment>

<comment>Neither one of them is consistently across the board, moderate, liberal, or progressive, or conservative. The voters aren't either. It's a silly conversation. It sounds like the NRA scoring people on gun issues, or what's his name and his stupid tax pledge. </comment>

<comment>They don't have to be "across the board" for any of the terms to be accurate and useful. Rarely do words cover anything "across the board". That's just not how language works in the real world.This is especially true when comparing candidates. I can say that Bernie is more progressive compared to Cruz. That carries meaning and is accurate. So for many people who do not have the time or effort or interest to look into each issue, it is important that those terms be used accurately by the media or else people won't know who are better representatives of their values. Words matter and you can't deny their effects.</comment>

<comment>It is an artful smear to say I'm progressive and your moderate, not a useful form if shorthand for busy people.  Better to listen to what they say on important topics, and decide how much you agree or disagree.</comment>

<comment>Smear? No. It's just language. </comment>

<comment>They are not being used accurately, that's the point. </comment>

<comment>No, that's MY point. They are not being used accurately and should be used accurately. The OP said that it doesn't matter how they are used. I said it does and that it should be used accurately since it ought to reflect policy. Maybe you should take a remedial reading class?</comment>

<comment>It is in fact not  what you said. Your analogy that Bernie sanders is more progressive then Ted Cruz, illustrates pretty well the flaws in the defintion of language you are attempting to use.  These labels are inaccurate and incomplete, sort of like the reasoning you are "Unartfully" trying to apply.  I suggest a course in semiotics would be useful.</comment>

<comment>See, this is why we need to reform our education system. It has failed to cultivate basic reading skills.The OP disagreed with the article. He said these terms don't matter if they're used accurately or inaccurately. Only the "policies" matter. I said that the terms, when used accurately, reflect policies. When used inaccurately can mislead, i.e., that the terms do matter.Now you say that they are being used inaccurately and that is "the point". That doesn't deny what I said. It actually affirms it.I still doubt you'll understand what I'm saying because your reading skills are so atrocious you won't be able to understand this explanation either.</comment>

<comment>I understand completely what you are saying. It's just that what your saying is not accurate. Your example of cruz and sanders, doesn't really say anything useful.</comment>

<comment>Yet you give no good reason for it. You seem to assume erroneously that language must be perfect to work. That words must cover all cases without exception to be useful and accurate. This rests on a poor understanding of language.</comment>

<comment>Your original example about sanders and Cruz was an extremely weak and inaccurate statement. It failed in any way to support your point. </comment>

<comment>Again, no reason given to demonstrate your claims. Just empty blather. Bernie is progressive on almost all issues. Cruz is conservative on almost all. These are widely accepted facts. You can ignore them but that only exposes your ignorance.</comment>

<comment>You really don't get it do you? </comment>

<comment>You're a great example of the failure of our education system. Learn basic reading, writing and thinking skills before engaging with adults.</comment>

<comment>Umberto Ecco would have fun with you.</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate knowledge?</comment>

<comment>BTW, you don't seem to know what an "analogy" is. My comparison between Sanders and Cruz wasn't an analogy. It was an example. Learn the difference.</comment>

<comment>Hi Nicolas,Just a friend helping you understand why that person was unable to understand your words.It's called "Post-Modernism", they reject that launguage has any actual meaning, and they deconstruct your language to avoid any subject matter.I can write a whole book sized pamplet on how they only exist to serve established wealth.  I could go on about how their rejection of truth leads to totalitarianism and cult like thinking.... but they wouldn’t care, I've had some "activist" write me back "blah blah blah".I'm only telling you this so you know what that is, when you see it again in the wild.  This is what they've been teaching students..... I know.... once I learned this , I stopped believing that formal education confers knowledge, and I also accepted the necessity of physical violence.  </comment>

<comment>That makes no sense. If words have no meaning then why did he reply using words?Postmodernism is BS. But I don't think most postmodernists will say that words have no meaning. They usually say that the meaning of words are contextualized to the writer's intentions or cultural background or some gibberish.</comment>

<comment>The reality is none of that matters. Wall Street and K Street own the politicians in this country and what we actually want or need is the last thing on their agendas.</comment>

<comment>If you think it's silly, then ask Hillary why she's so defensive about it?</comment>

<comment>If Clinton initiates reforms in the finance sector (Wall Street, Big Banks, tax breaks, etc.) would she not be biting the hands that have for so long fed her power base?  If Sanders initiates reforms in the finance sector will he be biting many hands that feed his power base?Both candidates are equally accomplished at negotiating the political arena as seasoned insiders, although Bernie has a far longer history in legislation than being a 1-term senator.   I worry that Hillary will nibble at the hands of her friends and patrons, whereas Bernie will chomp on them.</comment>

<comment>" I worry that Hillary will nibble at the hands of her friends and patrons, whereas Bernie will chomp on them."And that worries you?Says where you're coming from. Bet you like Citizens United decision also.</comment>

<comment>The CU decision is the biggest threat to US democracy since the Civil War.  Sander's constituents appear to be citizens (small C) united, whereas, without CU, one might wonder where Clinton would be getting her campaign financing.</comment>

<comment>"The CU decision is the biggest threat to US democracy since the Civil War. Sander's constituents appear to be citizens (small C) united, whereas, without CU, one might wonder where Clinton would be getting her campaign financing."Of course "The CU decision is the biggest threat to US democracy since the Civil War."But I still don't get your point. Are you afraid HRC couldn't campaign without CU? Or what?</comment>

<comment>Afraid? Odd question.Yes, I do think that Clinton would have no campaign if it were not for big special-interest money.   If the voters will not send Clinton campaign money, how can she run for Pres? Well, she has managed to amass $30 million in speaking fees - LOL. Maybe she could use some of that cash.</comment>

<comment>No, he's worried about the nibbling, and favors the chomping.  You were thrown by the phrasing, it seems.</comment>

<comment>So what you're saying is neither of these equalist clowns are fit for leadership, vote for Trumpgood call</comment>

<comment>Silly troll, Trump is for kids.</comment>

<comment>not so - equality is for kidsjust look at the voting demographics</comment>

<comment>Yea, except you just redefined it fecklessly, so you can post-modern away the truth.Establishment isn't an election result. or a title, it's who you represent.So who is the Establishment? Just a few..., AIPAC, ALAC, and the Chamber of Commerce.When is a politician part of the Establishment?  When they are approved by those interest groups.  A more "establishment" politician has more votes that those groups agree with, an anti-establishment politician pisses them off by serving their interests less.Why does this matter?  If your a normal working person, those groups hate you, they love America BECAUSE they ARE America. That is to say, they hate Americans.  They serve the interests of established wealth, as opposed to the interests of us, the working class people.</comment>

<comment>I am pretty sure you just proved my point.</comment>

<comment>I mean anyone who runs for President is part of the Establishment.  You can't tell me that Sanders as a life-long politician isn't part of the Establishment.  It's an asinine semantics play.</comment>

<comment>He's certainly got more claim to outsider cred than Clinton does. That isn't meant as a knock against her, it's just how it is. If anything, it shouldn't necessarily be a bad thing - having connections is important. The question is what you're going to do with them, and whether you're a puppet or a player.Consider FDR - probably the most liberal/progressive president we've had in the last century, and undeniably the most successful in pushing through changes. He was also about as "Establishment" as it gets - related to a former president, part of the rich, northeastern WASP establishment no less.</comment>

<comment>Claim sure.  But again, he's been in Congress for 20+ years and caucuses with the Democrats.  He's establishment.</comment>

<comment>There's also the question of why that should be a bad thing. After all, the most liberal/progressive president of the last 100 years, and also the most successful at pushing through changes, was FDR - who was as establishment as it gets. Relative of a former president, rich, northeastern WASP, former governor, Assistant Navy Secretary and Governor of New York? Yeah, total outsider.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I totally agree.</comment>

<comment>But he hasn't been corrupted during his years of public service.The contrast with the Clintons is stunning.Heck,  they even married off their only daughter to a bankster!</comment>

<comment>Yes, They sold their daughter to a banker for bride price.  You clearly have limited perspective.</comment>

<comment>I wonder how much they got for her?</comment>

<comment>It costs more if they pay by the pound.</comment>

<comment>I understand the Clintons charged by the boob.  They got spudwhisperer and azt24.</comment>

<comment>Christie should try that!</comment>

<comment>He did.  No Wall Street types want them.  In fact, no one does.Now if you want to talk about selling a really big boob, let's talk the Trump campaign.</comment>

<comment>Killary has big boobs purchased by Goldman Sachs.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand your FDR comparison. How does being part of the "establishment" have any bearing at all upon one's being "progressive"? Progressives have always advocated government solutions to social problems. If anything, progressives tend to depend heavily upon the political/governmental 'establishment' to carry their programs into effect.</comment>

<comment>The idea that conservative politicians are really for small government is laughable, and part of the three card monte shell game that they feed their base. They want government tilted to their own interests.  They want to nose themselves all the way into the wombs of women citizens, for example.  They want to subsidize big agriculture and corporate wealth.  Progressives merely want government to serve a larger swath of Americans.</comment>

<comment>psst, you answered the wrong question</comment>

<comment>" If anything, progressives tend to depend heavily upon the political/governmental 'establishment' to carry their programs into effect."-And that is CLEARLY working out great for us progressives. Not...Establishment BY DEFINITION is resistant to change...If they weren't, we wouldn't be in the pickle we're in ow</comment>

<comment>But government, by definition, no matter its form, is en 'establishment'.</comment>

<comment>If what the establishment had 'established' was good for the common man, we wouldn't be using the term derogatorily. Denmark's government is 'The Establishment' for the Danes...there's a reason the vast majority of it's citizens don't despise it...I guess it depends which Establishment you're talking about...Ours stinks.</comment>

<comment>But pretty much evryone all along the political spectrum in this country would agree that it stinks. Everyone, with some justification, believes that they, personally, are 'outsiders' and that the 'establishment' represents people other than themselves. And everyone, possibly excepting Trump, believes he/she is one of the 'common men/women'. Maybe we get the 'establishment' we deserve?</comment>

<comment>And how long have you spent in Denmark?  Do you know Danish history? It is ancient, shaped over more than a thousand years- most of it not as a democracy.  And I can guarantee you the 'establishment' isn't and hasn't alway been benign.I wish some of you would take enough time to get a scintilla of a clue before gushing ignorance about the rest of the world...I almost choked when Sanders said "tyrants", plural in regards to N Korea...</comment>

<comment>The American establishment controls MSM so we never hear much about other nations, it might give our people ideas.</comment>

<comment>but the interwebs go everywhere...</comment>

<comment>Why? The latest kid tyrant isn't the problem there, it's the system that has produced a whole series of tyrants.</comment>

<comment>good point!</comment>

<comment>But Bernie hasn't gotten rich as a Pasha over that period of time,  like the Clintons.Bernie has integrity.The Clintons,  not so much.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't refute my statement.</comment>

<comment>And it seems as though you didn't read the article that well. To repeat from the article: "Notice that Sanders didn’t say he isn’t a member of the establishment. He said he doesn’t “represent the establishment.” That strikes me as a perfectly defensible claim."</comment>

<comment>From the article, because I assume you missed it since you're attempting to make that point:"Notice that Sanders didn’t say he isn’t a member of the establishment. He said he doesn’t “represent the establishment.” That strikes me as a perfectly defensible claim."</comment>

<comment>He voted against Brady 5 times.  That sounds like establishment to me.</comment>

<comment>That's a pretty odd thing to pin "establishment" on.  By that measure, most police chiefs are anti-establishment.</comment>

<comment>LOL. How so? That's voting against the Democratic establishment.</comment>

<comment>It's a single issue that is disagreed on within the Democratic Party. It's not like voting to privatize SS or reinstitute segregation.</comment>

<comment>There's a big difference between having a ski run at Davos named for you and a dude who still does his own laundry.  Bernie got to where he is without the DNC placing him there, and he's fought against the neoliberal ruling class every step of the way.  The problem is that Hillary and Jeb are part of the same establishment, funded by the same donors, and pushing many of the same policies.  Hillary's donor list is nearly identical to Romney's from 2012.</comment>

<comment>There's literally no way that Sanders could get on the DNC ticket without the DNC placing him there. It's much more controlled than most people think. </comment>

<comment>If Bernie gets the majority of elected delegates, the DNC wouldn't dare to not nominate him.  They will do a lot though that it never comes to that.</comment>

<comment>Oh - was actually referring to the Senate (contrasting his path compared to Hillary's entrance in 2000).  Two terms and an SoS stint are respectable to be a candidate compared to her CV going into the Senate.  If nothing else, it's about 20X what old Woodrow Wilson had when the big banks placed him in there.Woodrow had about the same amount of experience as our first female President, Edith Wilson, when she stepped up to the plate.  </comment>

<comment>Have you guys heard that Hillary Clinton is a woman?   Sometimes she talks about that.</comment>

<comment>A vile,  corrupt liar of a woman,  but yes,  definitely a woman.</comment>

<comment>That's only a rumor at this point.  The woman part, I mean.</comment>

<comment>Really. You sound hysterical. Are you shouting?</comment>

<comment>Great history lesson CF, HRC truly is the most qualified for POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Only if you don't consider good judgment to be a qualifying factor.</comment>

<comment>Good judgement, have you seen Bernie's hair?</comment>

<comment>Hillary is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Wall Street Banks.Goldman Sachs,  Citicorp,  Morgan Stanley,  Bank of America.They bought her and they own her.Should she become President,  she will do their bidding.</comment>

<comment>Refusing to question HRC on the E-mails easily made it clear.  THEY ARE BOTH ESTABLISMENT. Duh.</comment>

<comment>Amazing but it was MSNBC</comment>

<comment>Might has well been Cartoon Network.</comment>

<comment>Sanders has been in public office since before the internet, indeed before conor or most who read the Atlantic were born.  trump's father built his entire real estate empire on government contracts; little trump has been talking about running for President and courting politicians since the late 80s.  cruz has worked in government since the mid-90s.  rand paul has campaigned and worked for his 20yr+ congressional father his entire life.Whether bloggers call them outsiders or not, all those running for President have come from and exemplify the establishment.</comment>

<comment>So how likely is it that any 'real' outsider could have any chance of even being nominated, let alone getting elected president? By that standard, there probably aren't any outsiders in elected office anywhere in the country, regardless of their partisan affiliations or political philosophy.</comment>

<comment>Jesse Ventura and Al Franken spring immediately to mind as outside the establishment.  There are many others (particularly at lower levels of government) coming from business, arts etc, but conor's contention was that Clinton was somehow set apart by being 'establishment'.</comment>

<comment>Ventura and Franken could arguably be described as having been part of the entertainment 'establishment' before entering politics.</comment>

<comment>Al Franken, at the least, was a Harvard Law (?) graduate - he got the invitation letter to the establishment, that's for sure.</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton cannot be part of the Establishment because she's a woman?I knew the Establishment was sexist, but I had no idea they were that sexist.  Good thing that Goldman Sachs gives her millions (and millions) of dollars in compenstation.  It's a meager, almost token, gesture.</comment>

<comment>Ummmm yes they are sexist so it's incredible she is their favored candidate </comment>

<comment>Hillary appears to be best defined as someone who plays the game well, no matter what rule book she is handed. No one goes undefeated, but she's outdone most by any measure from college on.  Not a bad characteristic for a president of the United States.Unlike Republicans, who famously asked, "why should we unilaterally disarm?" Clinton would welcome campaign finance reform, because she knows she'd be a winner in that game too.Yesterday I read a conservative blogger’s criticism of her fund-raising prowess, specifically in the financial community.  In a snarky moment hey referred to her as Clinton (D-Wall Street). I found it odd that this same writer did not dwell on oil companies' largess in contributing to Republicans, who rake the cash in, and wondered when I would next read “Bush (R-Saudi Aramco)”.</comment>

<comment>Hillary's final defense the gender card. PatheticWoman are equal unless I have no defense and then I'm going to say you're only picking on me because I'm a woman.reminiscent of Obama and the race card.</comment>

<comment>Wish Hillary would learn from Trump:Soeak a bit more honestly about how politics works.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  And saying “And that it is really quite amusing to me,” when obviously it's irritating, just come across as fake.</comment>

<comment>The article makes a good case that even though she is female she is establishment.Weird logic, kinda like blacks can't be racist</comment>

<comment>What could be more establishment than someone running for the Presidency of the United States.  How could anyone be more a representative, whatever his or her politics, of the establishment than the actual President of the United States?Never has there been a party so shamelessly interested in wielding political power than the current GOP, especially those of the extreme right who as a clear minority consistently put forth litmus tests of purity in their desire to not only set the national agenda but throw a monkey wrench into the agenda of everyone else including likely allies.While the Democrats are not so across the board nakedly absorbed in governing for its own sake, though the whisper of altruism sometimes sneaks into their motivations, this anti-guv'ment rhetoric we all buy into as a result, ultimately, of the so called Reagan revolution in which a long time union activist and leader and advocate of strict loyalty and toeing the government line personality, who had been a governor of a state whose economy was larger than many nations, pulled the wool over the American populace with his voodoo doodoo of a sawbuck for you on 4/15, Fort Knox for me line of blarney, and which the Republicans in his wake have been so good at perpetrating ever since that the Democrats too, in this era in which even Ronald Reagan could not live up to what have become conservative bonafides, must protest their allegiance to the oligarchal powers that be in relationship to W's fruition of the Reagan wet dream, the Citizen's United decision under the leadership of John Roberts and the gerrymandering of state and federal legislative districts.When individuals cannot compete with corporations for political speech, when political candidates do not have to compete with others representing different viewpoints for gaining and retaining elected office, of course there can be no politician who exists who does not represent an establishment that often is indifferent to the individual citizen, whichever party he or she comes from.</comment>

<comment>While the Democrats are not so across the board nakedly absorbed in governing for its own sakeLOL naïve you are</comment>

<comment>No actually, not so.The GOP has as a foundational reality, a devil take the hindmost perspective.  Helping people with things like regulations, social programs, health care, social security, environmental policies are part of the Democratic Party mo.  Those on the right, are bah humbug, open carry, deregulate the entire nine yards, tax breaks for the wealthy, utter denial of the root causes of poverty, subsidies and welfare for the big farmer and corporations, bomb, bomb, bomb, environmentally, at best, "what, me worry?" and a less than living wage for the rest of us.Democrats running for office certainly are caught up in fight for power, the name of the game, as a result, and this is true for both Clinton, obviously, and Sanders, but for the past 30 years or so, they have not run a non stop complain machine about everything under the sun without ceasing.  Senator Hillary Clinton worked with colleagues across the aisle on legislation.  Even Bernie Sanders worked on legislation with Ron Paul.They have never in the first week of a Republican Presidency have had a legislative leader so high up the totem pole as Senate Majority Leader publicly declare that they would work to make a failure out the President--devil take the hindmost for the American people.</comment>

<comment>OK you do know that executive amnesty and executive gun control, two clear power grabs circumventing congress were done by a D ObamaI've been around awhile and I've NEVER heard a president publicly state he was going to end around congress.Hillary is promising more of the same.On the other side I think that is what Trump is also proposing</comment>

<comment>It  is routinely done by Republican presidents. Ever hear of the Iran-Contra scandal?Executive orders? Singing statements? Not spending funds allocated (sequestering)?</comment>

<comment>Obama signed fewer executive orders then most presidents.</comment>

<comment>Amen. The Party of Government has few interests other than governing for its own sake.</comment>

<comment>Hillary's response to the "establishment" critique was cringe-worthy." Im not establishment, Im a woman!" Ok fine - but electing a first ______ is entirely separate from the critique of being an "establishment" candidate. You are not speaking to the critique at all! Someone goes "Hillary is a party -insider with deep pockets with alot of hands in them and she campaigns for personal prestige and power, ie career politician, instead of a set of political values or ideals" and her response is "but I'd be the first woman". Ok, for what it is worth (not much) Sander's would be the first Jew.</comment>

<comment>The mood has turned "anti-establishment"on both ends, and that is because we need a HUGE political readjustment.  There is no question of that.But your premise, Conor, that someone who has spent her life working within the system to try to make actual change is therefore "establishment" is flawed.Just because Hillary didn't single-handedly overthrow the system doesn't make her establishment.Just because Bernie says he wants change doesn't mean that he can deliver change.This is the bitter pill that no one really wants to swallow.The system is all f@*$ed up but we need to work together to make a difference.</comment>

<comment>There are better establishment critiques, but the way I view them is this. Both worked in the system, but how and in what way? Bernie runs as an independent, Hillary is a deep party-insider (from the head of the DNC, to the most prominent democratic donors,  her own husband, etc, she is surrounded by party elites). Bernie runs on a set of political values and ideals, Hillary runs as a career politician who "evolves" to whatever issue is the flavor of the week. Bernie's campaign is funded by a vast sea of small donors, Hillary's by the juggernaut Democrat donors and firms...</comment>

<comment>Question stands, who can actually MAKE change.</comment>

<comment>In this system? Change can come from a variety of ways. Through the elections in the Senate and Congress (these will be important to watch) and subsequent legislation, through executive orders, through Supreme court verdicts, etc. Anyone who thinks electing a president is a panacea and results in insta-change is a dope. Our system is designed to move slowly and only with much pressure. Bernie Sanders isnt the pressure, the movement supporting him is.</comment>

<comment>Completely agree Bernie and his supporters are weighing in, as are Trump and his supporters.  No one in Govt/politics can ignore this.  But Turmp and Bernie supporters are a world apart.  How to bridge that divide?  We can choose to magically think in a Democratic Senate and Congress, but if these are the conditions to a Bernie success story that's a very risky bet.  You think those on the right are going to wave a white flag and stand down?</comment>

<comment>After living in Washington all my life do I think the gridlock will stop? No not at all. And it is certainly a good point in terms of bridging the divide between Sanders and Trump supporters. If it comes to the general election, I think Sanders' best bet is to speak two things to them that they agree on: money in politics and guns.</comment>

<comment>We can agree to disagree, but I very much doubt that Trump supporters will line up behind Bernie, as much as this may make sense.  I've been talking to quite a few and the differences run far beneath the surface.</comment>

<comment>No I agree with you, I doubt they will too, but there is a possibility for a subsection.</comment>

<comment>True, but is this enough to peg our hopes on?</comment>

<comment>No Democrat can make change as long as the cons and neocons run Congress.</comment>

<comment>You know what we need?  A dictator!  This whole checks and balances thing is so inefficient.  Look at Mao, Hitler etc. they were able to get so much done!</comment>

<comment>"But your premise, Conor, that someone who has spent her life working within the system to try to make actual change is therefore "establishment" is flawed."Has the Democratic become more, or less liberal on economic matters in the time Clinton has been exerting her inside influence?  Has it become more, or less interventionist under her influence?In short, has her tenure increased, or decreased the fortunes of those who benefit from the Military-Industrial complex?</comment>

<comment>This is not a competition to be more "liberal".  Being centrist is not by necessity anathema.  The Military-Industrial complex is on the one extreme.  On the other is socialism.  There are plenty of us in the middle.</comment>

<comment>Socialism = Bureaucracy-Industrial complex.</comment>

<comment>That's the truth of it, but the side that Bernie's supporters don't want to acknowledge...</comment>

<comment>Middle = status quo.Middle = I'm comfortable, no change needed.Middle = Don't rock the boat.</comment>

<comment>With all due respect, neither Obama nor Hillary's platform were ever "no change needed", that's silly. Seeking revolution is not the only means of change.  Being centrist doesn't make one necessarily conservative.</comment>

<comment>I see no candidates professing less is better.Great article on this:http://www.coyoteblog.com/coyo...</comment>

<comment>The most offensive part of Clinton's claim was how she hid beneath her own skirts to defend herself, basically saying, "I can't be the establishment because I'm a girl." It got cheers from the very people who should have booed. If she's nominated, she wouldn't be the first woman nominated, (Ferraro, Dem, 1984, Palin, Rep, 2008 -- ADDED:both as VP, thanks for this catch maryellen, see below). She'd be the first woman president, if she wins, sure, but acting like the establishment doesn't, in fact, include a lot of successful, powerful women — including her, for decades! — basically craps on their accomplishments in her rush toward self-aggrandizement. Ugh.</comment>

<comment>Ferraro and Palin ran for VICE-President.</comment>

<comment>thanks, for the catchwill edit</comment>

<comment>Jill Stein of the Green Party ran for President in 2012 and will probably run this year. There's your WOMAN president.</comment>

<comment>It is a perversion of feminism that she basically accuses him of misogyny in response to pretty much any an all remarks he makes about her.</comment>

<comment>Feminism has been perverted from seeking equality to demanding superiority.</comment>

<comment>What's sadder is that many of her supporters are women who only care that she has a vagina.</comment>

<comment>I'd advise you to talk to more women, before you characterize our support in the way you have. Or are you going to tell us how wrong we are to be voting for her? ( sort of like if we only understood, we would agree with you)? 🤔🙄🙄🙄</comment>

<comment>Are you denying that many women are motivated to vote for her simply because she shares their sex? If so maybe you should talk to more women.</comment>

<comment>Here's the thing, it's sort of like RoevWade, women can vote for who ever they like, for what ever reason they like, including that they want a woman president, without having to run it by somebody else. You may like some of the reasons, you may not like some of the reasons, but in the end she will choose or not choose to take your opinion into consideration. </comment>

<comment>So are you saying that liking a presidential candidate because they share the same genitalia is as legitimate as liking them for their policy views? That's the state of our country when there are superficial people like that.</comment>

<comment>I'm saying you are not quite understanding that women have the right to choose on any reason they like. You may not understand it, but that's your problem. </comment>

<comment>I never denied they have the right to choose for whatever reason. Freedom to choose is not freedom from criticism of your choice.</comment>

<comment>Of course not, but you have decided that women are voting for Clinton because she is a woman, and you deem that shallow perhaps if you asked what reasons women have for voting for her, you might be less dismissive.  The fact that your imagination doesn't seem to include she is a very qualified candidate, illustrates the problem. Also it is perfectly valid to choose a candidate that you can relate to, she's a gal, at last. </comment>

<comment>I have asked. And many do list the reason as being that she'll be the first woman prez. I can't think of a more superficial and sexist reason.</comment>

<comment>It's possibly because we really don't feel the need to explain to you why she is a good choice. Possibly we respect her intelligence, the many battles she has had(she went to the wall to try and reform health care as First Lady and paid the price. And that's just for starters. You can think anything you want. I know my choice to vote for her is not shallow or sexist. Don't need to justify it to you.</comment>

<comment>OK, that's awesome.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the idea that a woman can't be part of the Establishment is laughable. But some people fall for it.</comment>

<comment>Sanders votes 98% of the time with Democrats who he says are corrupt because they take money from business and so represent them. If Sanders votes the same way as officials he says are corrupt representatives of the establishment, how can his votes be explained as different from theirs? Sanders wants people to believe what he says and ignore what he does. The same is true in foreign policy where he is virtually indistinguishable from Clinton in the policies he now offers but claims that his Iraq vote shows a superior grasp of foreign affairs to hers.</comment>

<comment>That's easy. Sanders will claim that he doesn't personally benefit from the way he votes. So he's voting along with corrupt politicians for corrupt legislation FOR FREE. That's how honest he is.</comment>

<comment>His ability to run for president is a personal benefit that comes to him from being a Senator, being on Democratic Party committees and so forth. He is "living his dream" thanks to that.</comment>

<comment>Sanders agrees mostly with the Democratic platform - its why he caucuses with them. On some issues he is much further to the Left than Democrats. On some issues he is actually more moderate or to the Right of democrats (including on guns - which I agree with him on. Gun ownership in a largely rural environment is much different than gun ownership in a huge urban environment, but I digress)/</comment>

<comment>What I am getting at is that Sanders can't both say he doesn't represent the corrupt establishment and also vote for the same legislation because a vote is the way interests are represented and he votes the same way as many other Democrats--some of whom also are on the left and also try to move legislation left but who do take campaign money.</comment>

<comment>As the debate progressed HRC was calling him out on this, right around the time Sander's face began to resemble an enraged tomato.</comment>

<comment>Well getting into voting record is tricky because there is more going on than just the simple vote. A good example is Bernie's attempt at getting unviersal healthcare through, which failed, but enabled him to get an amendment in a subsequent bill. Would Bernie have preferred his bill? Undoubtedly, but legislative politics is messy with compromise. But I understand what you are saying - and it seems the only way to not be a "corrupt establishment figure" by those standards is to be Carly, Carson, or Trump figure.</comment>

<comment>I accept and support the strategy of trying to make incremental change by the amendment process, which is what any legislator tries to do in Congress.My problem with the way Sanders is attacking Clinton is that it implies that her judgement --with which he sometimes agrees-- is corrupt because she takes campaign funds and speaking fees.  Yet he votes the same way on most issues. So if his vote is not corrupt but just is his view of the best compromise, why not admit that the same should be said of Clinton.Reasonable well intentioned people may differ in judgement about the best way to reach a goal.</comment>

<comment>I see your point, well said.</comment>

<comment>So....he should vote with republicans? I appreciate what you are saying but it's bit of a dead end if you stop to think about it for more than a second. </comment>

<comment>The way in which Hillary routinely tried to minimize the Wall Street concerns of Bernie Sanders was embarrassing. Any informed thoughtful viewer could see how flagrant the "wall street is just one part of the problem" argument was. Seeing that Goldman Sachs lobbyist sitting happily with her team in the audience, hearing her deflect the call to release transcripts of the speeches she gave them. Please. At least be honest about it. If she came out and said "yeah, I try to work with Wall Street. I think that its more realistic to channel their influence toward positive things that simply hope to get rid of it" at least thats a counter. Acting like you get be paid millions of dollars by anyone and not owe them is insane.</comment>

<comment>Also the war against woman.She was a one woman general in the war when it can to Bubba''s accusers.</comment>

<comment>Bill O'Reilly says that's how it works for successful people like the Clintons. Businesses are willing to pay you for speeches. That's just how it is, he says. He insists there's no quid pro quo. Bill O'Reilly..... looking out for Hillary Clinton, his fellow millionaire.</comment>

<comment>Killary is the DC doormat.A fat thief.</comment>

<comment>Derpa derp</comment>

<comment>The distinction between being part of the establishment and representing it, that Sanders makes and CF repeats is total spin. When Sanders votes for Democratic party bills as he did in the House and Senate he was representing the interests who lobbied for them and benefit from them no less than any other member of Congress.Who was he representing when he voted to deregulate swaps and derivatives?</comment>

<comment>He was representing the hundreds of millions of Americans who would have faced a significant interruption of benefits and work had the government shut down, as the deregulation measures were in the omnibus spending bill which needs to pass for the government to continue operating.All this does is illustrate that even though Bernie has strong ideals, he is every bit as pragmatic as Clinton when people's lives depend on it.</comment>

<comment>He was representing the same interests in each his votes as all the others in the House, or in the Senate whom he joined for or against.He describes their votes a selling out but his as progressive. That is double talk and noting else.When Sanders calls Clinton pragmatic and prone to compromise that is intended as a bug not a feature. When he describes himself that way it is a a revolutionary act.</comment>

<comment>Hypocritical. Disingenuous. Arrogantly speaking to us as if we're all ignorant and such ignorance is endearing but in need of her to take care of us in our infirmity. Hillary Clinton's good resume does not eradicate her frightening pattern of deceit, deception, and demagoguery. Minor progressive victories do not assuage the real feeling that they serve merely as window dressing in the house she built on the banks of Wall Street with the sweat of her ignorant masses. Maybe she'll serve to the fools a most wondrous cake. "Let them eat...lest they open their eyes."</comment>

<comment>right wing troll pretending to be left.</comment>

<comment>Have you seen the picture of Killary at the Goldman Sachs ground breaking?She's holding her silver plated shovel smiling like a pig in slop.</comment>

<comment>"Well, they offered me the silver shovel.... What was I supposed to do?"</comment>

<comment>That was a bizarrely constructed piece. That segue into discussing indications of corruption didn't really relate to the rest of the piece. You literally could have made the argument said you were making in half the space. But what you wanted was to remind people of the under-discussed possibilities of corruption.</comment>

<comment>If you go back to her UN speech about her server, pretty much everything she said has turned out to be a lie. Since no journalist has ever confronted her directly about her lies, she obviously thinks she can say anything.</comment>

<comment>If you didn't get a chance to see the full debate last night and don't want to watch short clips on Youtube, I found the full debate here https://youtu.be/LEws-_2kHq0Bernie had some pretty amazing moments. I still feel like he's holding back a bit on Hillary's corruption and it's frustrating to watch her start sidestracking on other companies that helped collapse the economy. Hopefully as these debates go by, Bernie starts letting loose a bit more and more every time.</comment>

<comment>The problem with any discussion of who is and who isn't part of the establishment is that no one is willing to explain what that term is supposed to tell us about politics.Sanders hasn't helped because he is content to leave ideas out of his campaign even though as a socialist outsider (the establishment, whatever else, is not socialist) is best positioned to do that.I prefer the term 'oligarchy' which has a clear meaning and application to politics. The oligarchy is the collection of individuals and entities that own 99% of the wealth and are in the top 1% of income.  In politics, then, the establishment can be defined as those political elites (government, bureaucracy, interest group, media) who transform the interests of oligarchy into law.The issue for the left (those who represent those not represented, or least represented) is how to advance the interests of everyone else. Once we recognise that the US is in fact an oligarchy, it is clear that the left will need to align with some part of the oligarchy and use its own power at the polls and otherwise to  reduce the power of the oligarchy  as a whole. In short, splitting the oligarchy by using the democratically inclined part of the establishment as a broker is a necessary part of left politics. The other part is enlarging the power of the majority outside politics by mobilization and organization. There is no successful left politics without representation of the left within the establishment and temporary alignment with a part of oligarchy.</comment>

<comment>This is what annoys me about HRC.  She has impressive credentials and should have been proud to tout them.  She could have said "yes, Bernie, I've been actively pushing progressive issues inside the Democratic party my entire adult life.  You aren't a member of the Democratic Party".  Instead she is afraid to be herself, and goes all weasily and off the point</comment>

<comment>Fair point, but Sanders would be able to point, just as fairly, to the fact that since she has risen to a position of influence within the Democratic party, it has in fact been moving to the right, not left, on the financial and foreign policy matters that are so important to him and so many other Americans.</comment>

<comment>Sure, and HRC can decide how to frame that.  e.g. she shares more with Obama.  But she needs to stop the BS</comment>

<comment>Obama? The guy who moved sharply to the left after the Republicans controlled both houses of Congress?</comment>

<comment>Sometimes I just can't help but notice that Hillary Clinton is a horrendously ugly old woman.</comment>

<comment>Wow! That's a crushing commentary.</comment>

<comment>It's the elephant in the room. An inescapable observation.</comment>

<comment>The main issue highlighted by this entire thing and the running theme of this election regardless of party is that Special Interest groups absolutely own all of these politicians and thus this country.At this point, I would have more respect for a politician that comes out and says I work for (insert special interest donor group) and I will do their bidding. At least this way we can fast forward to their actual policies and not have sift through their lies or be let down later when they eventually show their true colors.</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton exemplifies the "same old" character of this year's election.No new ideas.  No new plans.  Same old Wall Street contributors.  Same old failed policies from both sides with  nothing new.   This entire campaign season amounts "Vote for Hillary because vagina" (and be realistic folks-Sanders doesn't count-there is NO way the Democrats will let him win-just look at Iowa....)And the fact that Hillary is the "standard bearer" for "first woman President" is pathetic. Where is Olympia Snowe when you need her, damn it....</comment>

<comment>Regardless of what polls say about Bernie, Wall street and K street already bought their candidate and there's no refunds on Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Back in the day, and frankly for her whole career, going to college and becoming a great leader is exactly the opposite of what an establishment woman did.  In her day, a woman became a wife and mother.  She was part of the first wave.  Don't tell me she is establishment </comment>

<comment>Of course she is "establishment." Who cares?</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? By "establishment" most people mean that she changes her policies based on polls rather than conviction, that she's concerned with the welfare of the donor class rather than ordinary Americans, that her loyalties are to Wall Street and corporate America rather than the workers, that she's a political creature with no exposure to real life, that she's a bullshitter extraordinaire. Who on earth cares that she decided against being a housewife? She became a bought scumbag instead. That's terrific. </comment>

<comment>My point is that it's not as easy for women to turn away from traditional avenues when they haven't even been allowed to BE in the traditional avenues until about 20 years ago, and certainly a lot more recently for real leadership positions.  There are hoards of men who have the experience and backers to become President and CEOs and senators.  Because women just started working there are many fewer of us in these positions.  The baby boomers were really the first ones where this happened, and she's in her late 60s, the age of the first wave women being allowed to even be in leadership!  She went the traditional way because she had to, to get to this point where she is on the brink of being President of the United States.  There really was no other way for a woman to do it at this point in history.  This is why it is SO hard for women to get into these positions, because they are judged as if they had the same path as men for the last 50 years.  It's not true.  Yes Bernie has the option to be anti-establishment, as a man of his generation.  This generation of young people grew up with women side by side with them in school.  They forget that the top of most corporations, governments and other leadership positions in the world are full of men, there are various kinds of men up there.  There's really only one kind of woman up there, the Peggy's of the world, not the Betty's or the Megan's.  Maybe one day women will have the freedom to be in charge AND be anti-establishment but it will take a few more decades.</comment>

<comment>I would rather not vote for a woman who supports the plutocrats. I would rather vote for Warren than Clinton. Not all women are alike.</comment>

<comment>Warren isn't one of the types of women who can win yet.  She's also afraid of public speaking so she won't run. </comment>

<comment>While I appreciate the earnestness of your response - I do - this is a giant load of horseshit. She's a bought politician, a warhawk and a plaything of big banks (in my view and the view of plenty of others). That analysis doesn't change even slightly because she has a vagina.And for what it's worth, there have been PLENTY of anti-establishment women over the last 100 years. </comment>

<comment>What percentage of them were CEOs, Cabinet members and governors and senators ? </comment>

<comment>This article should have been read at the debate last night . Hillary could respond if she wanted to.</comment>

<comment>Wait. The frontrunner for the Democratic primaries was president of young republicans? </comment>

<comment>And the competition isn't even a Democrat now. go figure.</comment>

<comment>Sanders' former party--he ran for them in Vermont--now has resolved that he is a War Criminal."RESOLUTION OF THE LIBERTY UNION PARTYEvery member of the Vermont Congressional Delegation is a War Criminal, as defined by the International Criminal Court and United Nations Human Rights Commission Resolution  A/HRC/29/L, due to their respective votes (August 22, 2014) approving $225 million dollars additional military aid to Israel, supporting Israel’s 2014 invasion of Gaza (July 7-August 4).http://www.libertyunionparty.o...</comment>

<comment>Sanders was running on the Liberty Union party line.</comment>

<comment>To anyone who is informed about politics, I think he knows that by "establishment" he means the DCCC, the DNC, ALEC, the well-funded industry lobby groups and the politicians who answer to them. Bernie Sanders can't be bought, is principled, and represents the people in Vermont.The term "establishment," with no context is vague enough that it can be used against anyone. But in the context of is campaign, it's pretty clear what he's talking about. The Democratic party now is as corrupt as it was in the days of Tammany Hall. The machine needs to be dismantled, piece by piece.</comment>

<comment>You have to be blind deaf mute transgender imbecile to think that Clinton is a viable choice as POTUS... But hey Amerikunts care more about some new phantasmagoria show on TV than anything of substance. Mundus vult decipi. Ergo decipiatur. Which is latin for how fvkin stupyd most of you are</comment>

<comment>Maybe you can send the rest of us a genius pill then.</comment>

<comment>High school Latin rocks, bro.</comment>

<comment>High school latin gets me past the filters doh</comment>

<comment>I'm noticing a pattern with Hillary. Back in the fall, she called herself a moderate. Then, after Bernie started surging in the polls, she began calling herself a progressive and hasn't stopped. Now she's taking issue with being labeled establishment and trying to assert that she isn't part of the establishment. Here's an idea. Let people label you however they want. You shouldn't have to constantly tell us that you're a progressive, unless maybe you're worried that we'll realize you're not. You shouldn't have to tell us that you're not part of the establishment, unless you're worried that we'll think you are. What I find very refreshing is that he owns the labels people assign to him. If someone calls him a socialist, he doesn't try to distance himself from or act ashamed of it.</comment>

<comment>Goldman Sachs boss Lloyd Blankfein interviewed on CNBC talking about Bernie,  "I don't know, he seems like an Ok type of guy, I have never met him."</comment>

<comment>OK...Hillary is part of the Democratic side of the "establishment" that governs the USA. So is Bernie, though somewhat less so. So is everyone running on the Republican side, including Trump and Cruz, whom the rest of their establishment seems to hate.If you want non establishment leaders, go down to the local tav and draft someone.</comment>

<comment>Fun facts: Hillary ties Cruz in a general election buts gets spanked (I went there) by Rubio (who's basically a Democrat himself).http://www.quinnipiac.edu/news...</comment>

<comment>That is national poll which does not equate to electoral votes.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, but 7% is still a spanking.</comment>

<comment>Assuming Trump's voters don't bolt if Rubio gets the nomination.  An assumption I'm not sure is warranted.</comment>

<comment>Bolt to whom? Bloomberg? </comment>

<comment>Isn't Rubio a supporter of rapists who conceive children through rape?</comment>

<comment>This.So this.I mean, she strawmans and then deflects instead of openly answering.Also, I always called her a republican, because she votes like a liberalish one.I found this as surprising as I found it unsurprising.Bernie or bust, 2016.</comment>

<comment>"She went to meetings where the global elites decide what's going to happen".  That in one sentence is the difference between Hillary and Bernie. Bernie wants the American people to decide, per the US Constitution. Hillary is a neoliberalist, which means global corporations bypassing national governments through secret trade agreements like TPP and TTIP.   I would think these abominable agreement-betrayals probably first started in one of these meetings.</comment>

<comment>It shows how behind  the times Hillary is. Younger women no longer buy into the outdated way she plays the gender card.</comment>

<comment>Also I love the way Hillary talks about failing to accomplish something in the past and when someone else later succeeds in doing it, she then takes credit for it.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure how the characterize the "establishment" in politics. My best way of describing it is Hillary Clinton.</comment>

<comment>The metrics and range of word choices eventually fall short, when people really evaluate leadership by their own visceral measurement.  Most people know which candidates are speaking to them without needing to qualify or defend that engagement with words or phrases which merely serve a journalistic deadline.</comment>

<comment>If I were Hillary, I'd just embrace who I am."The Establishment" is not in and of itself a bad thing. If the current Democratic establishment is exemplified by Obama, who remains incredibly popular among Democrats, why wouldn't you want to embrace that?Hillary's invoking Obama a lot, which is a very wise move. In many ways, the 2016 election will be about preserving his legacy. I suspect that like in 2000, there will be a lot of people who've just come to take it for granted just how competent the Democratic establishment has been. They lose sight of the fact that we had terrible Republican leadership less than a decade ago. People need to be reminded of this, especially younger people who may have not remembered how goddamn demoralizing the Bush Administration was.After 8 years of good leadership, it's easy and satisfying to say things like "There's no real difference between Democrats and Republicans." People said that about Gore and Bush. Look how that turned out.There are HUGE differences. So yes, let's not make it a cakewalk for Hillary, or anyone. But don't get myopic at the end.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is, in the eyes of many, simply the best candidate special interest money can buy.</comment>

<comment>How does Sanders vote 90% of the time in Congress for 25 years vote with the Democrats, caucus with them, and say he is an independent outsider who now wants to represent the Democratic party because other Democrats were  influenced to vote by the oligarchy while he has not been?</comment>

<comment>Because he has not been influence by the oligarchy.</comment>

<comment>When a person lacks the mental capacity to engage in thoughtful debate but possesses the immaturity to engage nonetheless, that person typically resorts to senseless name-calling, irrelevant analogy, or meaningless talking points. Take, for instance, the "troll" identification used by so many on bulletin boards. Most of the people using the word have little to no understanding of its meaning - or they don't care. Case in point: I'm not a troll. I'm a person seriously engaged in the political process and disturbed by the wealth of ignorance obvious in our country's exercise of the rights granted in a democratic republic.I believe few of the candidates are worthy or wise choices. Sanders may be the best of all the evils, because the best options are on the sideline. Trump? Too immature and ignorant of history. (I'm sure he uses the "troll" line often.) Clinton? Not trustworthy and wholly self-serving. Cruz? Maniacal. Rubio? Not trustworthy. Carson? Ignorant of important historical and current global political facts.... Sanders? Socialist. This last one is intriguing but not nearly as intriguing as the fact that these folks supposedly represent the best we can do. </comment>

<comment>Except Congress is not part of the Establishment, though member of the Establishment have indeed been in Congress. The reason Congress is not part of the Establishment is that it does't actually hold power or authority. It's the Establishment (also known as the Plutocracy) who holds real power. The Congress are just the people hired to carry out the Establishment's orders.</comment>

<comment>Mr Friedersdorf missed the point. Secretary Clinton is not part of the establishment because she has a vagina.Individuals with vaginas are not part of the establishment</comment>

<comment>The correct term is "Vagina Americans"</comment>

<comment>2.     HILLARY IS SAVED BY MONICA, says a newspaper reporting on the Whitewater Prosecutors criminal case files.The article said prosecutors dropped their Whitewater criminal case, in order to work on the newly developing Monicagate, in which Big Bill was suspended 5 years from practicing law, fined $90,000 for false testimony and contempt of court, and subjected to impeachment proceedings. There was no follow up on the Whitewater case.But the prosecutors recently released detailed case notes show they wanted to prosecute and clearly spells out many specific reasons why they definitely smelled corruption, if not collusive cover up in their Clinton Whitewater case files.    They did not think well of both Clintons character and behavior.Honest Hillary loyalists, will continue to backpedal that, no prosecution means no evidence.  So this is just another childrens bedtime horror / fantasy story.   Yes, this is just a mere nothing.Some say, Hillary has a pact with Lady Luck’s Super Pac at her side, as in coin tosses and such.What do you think?o      Is she wrapped in warm sunlight, mysterious fog, or in volcanic ashes? o      Is she enveloped by the white of pure snow, or the shadows of the dark side?o      Is she in the nature of the Jedi Knights, or of the Sith Lords?o     Are you proud of her ability to get things done?o     Are you proud of her?o     Will you let her manage your finances?
