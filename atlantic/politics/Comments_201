<comment>For Republicans, fealty to the NRA trumps their anti-terrorism bluster.</comment>

<comment>But bae, there is no due process, this is authoritarianism.</comment>

<comment>Which is why there should be a due process way to appeal being on the no fly list but Republicans don't seem to care about that much.</comment>

<comment>That's exactly it. Republicans had no problem at all with keeping people off airplanes with no due process, but once guns are involved Republicans suddenly remember to care about due process.</comment>

<comment>Who thinks what when has very little to do with whether it is right or wrong to ignore the due process protections of the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Well, it does when people are changing their views because of political expedience...</comment>

<comment>Like you are doing right now..</comment>

<comment>It's Team Politics.</comment>

<comment>You don't have any right to get on a plane. I have a right to keep and bear arms.</comment>

<comment>But you do have a right to due process which the law prevents.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't justify violating costitutional rights. Fight against the no fly list if you like.</comment>

<comment>Basically, the process for the no fly list needs to be made constitutional, then you could argue that placing a restriction on gun ownership was constitutional (since the rights granted under the 2nd Amendment, like the 1st, aren't absolute but instead subject to a high level of scrutiny).</comment>

<comment>The right to travel is a fundamental right.  You're doing the same thing the Democrats do with guns.  Flying is a right and so is driving a car, and the government shouldn't be able to prohibit or unnecessarily regulate either.</comment>

<comment>No, there is no right to flight. Try again. </comment>

<comment>THEY NEVER MENTION THE WORD "AIRPLANE" IN THE CONSTITUTION!!!!!  (for some reason)</comment>

<comment>Not my problem, constitution guaranteed my right to keep and bear arms in the 2A, there isn't any guarantee to board a plane.</comment>

<comment>the funny thing is that you are being serious.</comment>

<comment>100%</comment>

<comment>You do realize that the Constitution doesn't have to explicitly state that something is a right for it be a right, don't you?</comment>

<comment>You do realize that boarding a plane isn't a right? Don't you?</comment>

<comment>Like all rights, your right to bear arms is not unabridged. It can be regulated, just not unduly so.</comment>

<comment>You ignored that flight isn't a right. Try again.</comment>

<comment>You're right, I did ignore it. Here's what I think: The no-fly list should have a due process component wherein no one is placed on that list until a suitable appeal process is complete, if desired. And there should be notice given to the individual. Once that process is complete, and if the individual is found to be properly on the list, then their gun rights can and should be limited. Hence, gun rights can properly be limited when necessary as much as any other right (speech, etc.) can be properly curtailed when necessary.</comment>

<comment>Ok, so push for a due process measure for the no fly list. The no fly list doesn't give any legitimacy to limiting our 2A right to keep and bear arms without due process.</comment>

<comment>Regulation is an “infringement,” Mike.What part of “...shall not be infringed” do you NOT understand???Let me help you with that:“A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”(The text as ratified by the states and authenticated by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.)In law and statutes, the word ‘shall’ has the following meaning:“An imperative command; has a duty to or is required to. For example, the notice shall be sent within 30 days. Usually ‘shall’ used here is in the mandatory sense.”“When used in statutes, contracts, or the like, the word ‘shall’ is generally imperative or mandatory.”[Independent School District No. 561 v. Independent School District No. 35, 284 Minn. 426, 436-37, 170 N.W.2d 433, 440 (1969)]“In common, or ordinary parlance, and in its ordinary signification, the term ‘shall’ is a word of command, and one which has always, or which must be given a compulsory meaning; as denoting obligation. It has a peremptory meaning, and it is generally imperative or mandatory. It has the invariable significance of excluding the idea of discretion, and has the significance of operating to impose a duty which may be enforced, particularly if public policy is in favor of this meaning, or when addressed to public officials, or where a public interest is involved, or where the public or persons have rights which ought to be exercised or enforced, unless a contrary intent appears; but the context ought to be very strongly persuasive before it is softened into a mere ‘permission‘, etc.”[People v. O'Rourke, 124 Cal. App. 752, 759 (Cal. App. 1932)]The Founders use of the word “shall” removes all doubt as to its being a command not subject to any other interpretation.Their use of the adverb “not” is yet another command word.Their use of the verb “be” means "occur” or “take place.”And their use of the verb “infringed” cannot have any other meaning than “a intentional violation or breach of a legal right, contract, or statute.”All the above simply means that any law, code, statute or ruling which prevents or prohibits an individual from purchasing or otherwise receiving and owning a firearm; _any_ firearm; or other “arms,” is to be considered patently unconstitutional and not to be used to deny that individual's sacrosanct 2nd Amendment Right to Keep and Bear Arms: unless and until that individual's right is individually and specifically subjected to being modified or removed by a court of law after using due process.Oh; in case you want to trot out that old “But the 2nd Amendment means you have to be in the National Guard, since that's ‘the militia’ the Constitution means.”First off: there are three “militias”:The Organized Militias:—  The State Militia—  The Militia of the United StatesandThe Unorganized Militias of both the United States and each stateThis covers the Federal Militias:10 USC §311 : Militia: composition and classes(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.(b) The classes of the militia are-(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.As to the Militias of the several states: you have to research your own state's Militia Statute.Now that we have that settled:Supreme Court of the United StatesDistrict of Columbia et al v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008)26 June 2008“The [Second] Amendment's prefatory clause announces a purpose, but does not limit or expand the scope of the second part, the operative clause. The operative clause's text and history demonstrate that it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms.”Prefatory Clause:“A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state,”Operative clause:“. . .the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”“Are we clear???”—Col. Nathan R. Jessup, USMC Gitmo</comment>

<comment>Sure, and if they let you have a butter knife they are letting you be armed.Your reasoning is the same as theirs, and just as divorced from American values as theirs are.</comment>

<comment>My reasoning is not the same because I have a constitutional right to be armed, they have no constitutional right to flight.</comment>

<comment>So much for the Ninth Amendment and innumerable Court decisions recognizing the right to travel.  Because useful idiots are always willing to trade away rights.You really are no different than those leftists.  You're just a different flavour of statist.</comment>

<comment>Ok, Leftist, try to equate getting onto a plane with our 2A right to keep and bear arms allllll you want but it just makes you seem ignorant and desperate. Fine by me.</comment>

<comment>There is no Constitutional right to get on an airplane. But there IS a Constitutional right to bear arms.I know liberals are used to regarding the Constitution as Play-Dough, but try to remember the difference.</comment>

<comment>Incorrect. Things don't have to be listed to be protected rights. Every one has Natural Rights that have existed since time immemorial. </comment>

<comment>There is no constitutional right to fly on an airplane.    Big difference. </comment>

<comment>And Democrats suddenly forget about it.</comment>

<comment>There is no right to fly on private aircraft. There is a right to keep and bear arms. That's the big difference. </comment>

<comment>Guilty until proven innocent, huh.</comment>

<comment>That's exactly right. The no-fly list was a violation of due process. But it was tolerated until it was connected to guns.</comment>

<comment>There's an old saying applicable here:"Depends on whose ox is being gored."</comment>

<comment>Neither do Democrats, which is kinda the point of the article.</comment>

<comment>Any proof of that- or are you just blowing smoke out your ass?</comment>

<comment>The complete lack of Republican attempts to address it is sufficient.</comment>

<comment>It's not hard to understand. If the no-fly list is completely f*cked up, with lots of normal, non-terrorists on it - taking away their guns first makes no sense.First, fix the effing no-fly list. THEN, take their guns away. I am sure that most members of either party would find that reasonable.If I am wrong about that - prove it.</comment>

<comment>What has stopped the Republicans from doing exactly that at some point in the last 13 years? What stops them from doing that now?  Again, the complete lack of Republican attempts to address it is sufficient.</comment>

<comment>What has stopped the Democrats from fixing it?  They had control of Congress for awhile, as well, and the problems with the list have been periodically in the news since 2001</comment>

<comment>I like how you mysteriously hold no accountability at all for Democrats in Congress and POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Mysterious that I don't derail the discussion by suddenly deflecting to a different topic, huh?To recap: you claimed Republicans are for fixing the no-fly list, and then denying guns to those who are on it. I pointed out if that were true, they can and would do exactly that.You responded: but Democrats!, implying that you did not have either any coherent counterpoint to make, or the integrity to accept the obvious truth when it is pointed out to you, and hoped you could bluster your way out. It's a weak effort, however, depending as it does on a 2-second attention span. Does that kind of thing work on you?</comment>

<comment>The NRA, as in the people who actually teach safe gun use? Anti gun nuts are poisoning the well of ideas with euphemisms to give you the preconceived notion that guns are evil.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the NRA is primarily a gun safety club for hunters and this is 1926.</comment>

<comment>Sorry if this doesn't live up to your 4 year Liberal art degree education standards, but here are some courses the NRA offers, along with basic safety instructions for the uninformed.http://www.nrainstructors.org/...https://eddieeagle.nra.org/par...http://training.nra.org/nra-gu...</comment>

<comment>Quick, tell the NRA that something is wrong with their website!  The NRA homepage literally features NOTHING regarding safe gun use!  Someone accidentally replaced all of that content with:(1) "Demons at our Door" -- a recorded statement by LaPierre that literally compares people seeking to regulate guns with demons.  Ha ha. No, but seriously, this is a real thing.  And it's the main feature currently on NRA.org.(2) "My freedom" -- a recorded statement by some random dude that also demonizes people seeking to regulate guns.  But to random dude's credit, he doesn't literally call them demons.(3) "Desecration of Church by State" -- New Jersey requires that pastors seeking concealed carry permits fill out paperwork.  PAPERWORK! Jesus didn't have to fill out paperwork before he got a gun. Ha ha.  I'm kidding about this one... lol, no, I'm not! http://www.americas1stfreedom....</comment>

<comment>1. I'd consider these gun control supporters to be demons (euphemistically speaking of course):-Adolph Hitler-Fidel Castro-Joseph Stalin-Kim Jong Il2. You're falling back on circular reasoning, assuming the premise of argument 1. is correct, "det all gun owners is all hillbillies". Well so far you're being schooled by this hillbilly.3. Nowhere in this article is your aforementioned quote about Jesus, and the fact that you would unjustly persecute someone for their religion makes you a bigot. Now before you go spewing some nonsense about Islamophobia, scrutiny of Islamic teachings is justified given the current state of affairs in the world.Thanks for making me waste 2 minutes that I'll never get back. Now piss off with your lies.</comment>

<comment>You automatically lose an argument when you claim yourself as the "winner," let alone looking like a total fool in the process. There's a dolt out there leading the GOP who claims that he's a winner and that everyone who disagrees with any of his asinine principals is a loser. Take heed.</comment>

<comment>LOL spoken like a true loser, you obviously have no idea how good winning feels.</comment>

<comment>Resorting to name calling now. Wow, you ARE a winner.</comment>

<comment>Actually Hitler loosened restrictions on gun owner ship for most of the population. So not really a gun control supporter.</comment>

<comment>Guess your "Search" tactics suffer, as all these training programs are safety-related:National Rifle Association of AmericaEducation & TrainingTraining DepartmentFrom beginner to developing competitor, the NRA Training Department develops safe, ethical, responsible shooters through a network of more than 97,000 instructors and range safety officers, more than 5,700 coaches, and more than 1,800 training counselors. NRA Training Counselors recruit and train instructors to teach NRA's basic firearm courses. NRA Coaches, in turn, develop competitors at the club, high school, collegiate and national levels.Hunter ServicesWith over 2.3 million members who hunt, the NRA offers hunters a wide range of programs addressing all aspects of hunting, including youth hunter skills, advanced skills training and the conservation of our natural and wildlife resources. All Hunter Services Department programs work toward the common goal of instilling and promoting the skills and ethics that will ensure the continuance of America's proud hunting heritage.Women's ProgramsIt hasn't always been easy for women to break into the world of shooting sports. But now with organized programs for women, by the women of the NRA, it's as easy as can be. Whether a woman's interest is personal safety, gun safety, gun knowledge, marksmanship, hunting, or recreational or competitive shooting, the NRA has a variety of programs and activities that all encourage female participation at all skill levels.Youth ProgramsThe NRA helps America's adult leaders and national youth serving organizations set up shooting programs, introduces the first-time or intermediate shooter to a lifetime of recreational and competitive opportunities, and develops programs for NRA youth members and NRA-affiliated youth clubs.http://training.nra.org/</comment>

<comment>Don't forget:http://le.nra.org/trainingNRA Law Enforcement Division | Law Enforcement TrainingThe Law Enforcement Division (LED) of the NRA was established in 1960 specifically to provide the law enforcement community with a means to certify law enforcement firearm instructors. Over the last 50 years, we have trained more than 55,000 law enforcement firearm instructors and currently have over 11,000 active certified instructors.I am one of their graduate Law Enforcement Handgun / Shotgun, Patrol Rifle & Select-Fire Instructors (now retired).</comment>

<comment>is that what you got from checking out the weather charts?</comment>

<comment>And for leftists, hate of rights trumps due process.</comment>

<comment>Because......Obama would put the whole country on the no fly list.  PS  Why aren't the people on the no fly list deported or arrested?</comment>

<comment>Jesus, why does everything have to become a partisan issue? I think that most reasonable Americans of any political party want the bad guys to be on the no-fly list, and the good guys to be off the list.This needs to be an issue of competence, not partisan politics.</comment>

<comment>The media certainly doesn't help in that regard, constantly reinforcing the idea that there are only two worldviews in our country. They appeal to Americans' inability to see issues in anything other than a binary manner. Black/white, good/bad.</comment>

<comment>MSM does not do nuance, for sure. They also manufacture fake partisan controversy where it does not even exist.</comment>

<comment>Fox News is far worse.</comment>

<comment>that's like saying leukemia is far worse than pancreatic cancer</comment>

<comment>Ocacsionally my remote accidentally lands me on Fox News or MSNBC; I find them both equally appalling.</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic is ever worse.</comment>

<comment>Like criticism Obama for not fighting ISIS?</comment>

<comment>Fox News is MSM.  MSNBC is at the left of the narrow MSM spectrum, and Fox is at the right.  Meaning, in any red state, it is still well left of center on most issues</comment>

<comment>To be honest, given the rhetoric I suspect that the this is becoming the general consensus of the voting populace. Look at the Tea Party, it's a grievous sin for any Republican to compromise with Democrats, on anything regardless of whether or not that compromise is in the best interest of the nation.</comment>

<comment>You might be misrepresenting what the tea party stands for.  They are more true conservatives that the GOP, calling for limited/smaller government, lower taxes, and stuff like that. Of course they have some fringe elements, but the basic philosophy doesn't include "don't agree with democrats." Perhaps it's just that democrats don't agree with them.</comment>

<comment>It actually originated as "TEA" Party: for "Taxed Enough Already!"</comment>

<comment>I've seen no reputable sources that support this. The name is a reference to the Boston Tea Party. It's as much "Taxed Enough Already" as TIP is "To Insure Proper Service."</comment>

<comment>You can put me down as your "reputable source," DD.  :-)In 2010, I worked for the US Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census, as an Assistant Crew Leader for a crew of Census Enumerators.As such, part of my job entailed doing the "door-to-door" enumeration of non-filers who my crew members were unable to contact.While doing this all across the county, I observed many of these TEA Party yard signs:http://i3.cpcache.com/product/...The fact that it "mirrored" the sentiments of the 'Sons of Liberty' members who carried out the ''Boston Tea Party'' (actually: "the Destruction of the Tea in Boston") dumping of East India Company tea into the harbor is merely "icing on the cake," so to speak.  :-)</comment>

<comment>I'm not denying that some in the movement have used it. Just as people do with "TIPS."  However, it started as a reference to the Boston Tea Party. Your anecdote is interesting, but anecdotal.</comment>

<comment>When has Obama compromised on anything?  Why do you think he uses executive orders.  JFK, LBJ, Clinton all worked with Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Because The Atlantic / MSNBC / Fox News / New York Times / Wall Street Journal are blatant cheerleaders for their respective political parties, and their sheeplist consumers refuse to acknowledge it, or that their cheerleaders have moved further to the extreme in the past decade.At least in the UK, the Daily Telegraph is proud of its conservative heritage, and the Guardian is proud of its liberal heritage.</comment>

<comment>Yeah but it's interesting the reversal don't you think? It shows how inconsistent both sides can be.</comment>

<comment>Not really. One side is saying you can't restrict that because it is a constitutional right. The other side is saying that if we are going to limit one thing we should infringe on constitutional rights.</comment>

<comment>I don't know, perhaps english is your second language but it appears that what you are trying to say is that we have a Constitutional right to guns but no constitutional rights to get on a plane. That's a specious argument because though the constitution doesn't say that we have a right to get on a plane it does say we have a right to due process and transparency of gov.</comment>

<comment>I am absolutely saying we have a constitutional right to keep and bear arms and not a constitutional right to board a plan. If you don't realize that then you need to read the constitution again.</comment>

<comment>I have read the constitution but you're missing the point about due process (which you'd know is part of the constitution if you'd read it).</comment>

<comment>True, to a degree - but there are wings or factions within each party too.  There are Republicans who oppose this just to stick it to Obama (in the same way that Code Pinko was pretty much a Democrat front group used to attack Bush), but there are others who have been consistently strong on civil liberties (i.e. the more libertarian wing of the party).  You can see the struggle in the current GOP Primary, where strong security/establishment/statists like Christie or Kasich (and Bush to a lesser degree) will square off against the more libertarian-minded like Rand Paul and to a lesser degree Ted Cruz.  Rubio is consistently somewhere in the middle and Trump will say whatever occurs to him without any need for serious consistency.I don't know the Democrat inside-baseball stuff as well, but I have to assume (hope?) that they also have some internal debate on these matters.FWIW, there should probably be a very limited "No Fly List" for the worst of the worst - people who should not be allowed to enter the US (and if found here should be deported or jailed) - those folks would already be qualified from purchasing firearms by being foreigners or jailed.  There would also be a broader list of people who who have been flagged for additional scrutiny at the airport, but are not prevented from flying - and this list would not serve to disqualify one from purchasing a firearm (or a machete, gasoline, matches, chlorine and ammonia, diesel or a large vehicle).</comment>

<comment>You're dealing  in nebulous terms.  Good guy?  Bad Guy?   Who decides?   Another Lois Lerner type?    No thanks! .There's a thing called 'due process' that prevents citizens'  rights form being stripped so arbitrarily</comment>

<comment>It's easy, we're the the good guys and they're the bad guys... Of course, the other guys are doing the exact same thing. Funny how that works.</comment>

<comment>ISIS has due process? Tell me more.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, smug guy we have all heard of "due process". Nobody is against due process.Even with due process, we are going to have to agree on a reasonable way of distinguishing good guys from bad guys. If we cannot do that - we are ALL f*cked.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. The no-fly list is not bad in principle, but this demonstrates the danger of giving the government power unbounded by transparency or due process.</comment>

<comment>You don't have a right to 'fly' so a no-fly list shouldn't be an issue of constitutionality. It's when the government wants to extend this to an explicit 'Right' found within the Constitution where it becomes a problem.What would be more effective for stopping terrorism is for those on the no-fly list to give up their 4th Amendment rights and allow random property searches by government agents. That way, the government could ensure not only that potential terrorists aren't stockpiling guns but their apartments aren't bomb factories as well.Or we could follow the Constitution and not pick and choose the Rights we like and restrict the Rights we don't for the sake of short-term politics.</comment>

<comment>Better yet, just jail all the terror suspect. Put them in camps.  Also to make it easier, we could just put in anyone with a Muslim sounding name or people that have beards.  That would ensure we get em all.</comment>

<comment>The right to travel is a fundamental right.  The government shouldn't be able to hinder or impede it without just cause.  We too easily excuse infringements on our rights.</comment>

<comment>Liberals have faith in the competence of government, despite all evidence to the contrary. Therefore they don't want to discuss the question.</comment>

<comment>This is my complete lack of surprise. Its a mirror to how (for liberals) overturning Roe v Wade would be messing with settled law, and yet the Constitution is a "living document" allowed to change with the times.Don't look smug, cons. You've got plenty of skeletons of your own in that closet.</comment>

<comment>If gun shops sent a tally of ammunition purchases tied to a name, the San Bernardino shooters would have been caught after purchasing over 6,000 rounds.</comment>

<comment>As someone who shots at least 100 rounds a week, 6,000 rounds isnt that much... With your grand plan, I'd get "caught" 1-2 times a year for breaking that limit.</comment>

<comment>How about a compromise position--reporting of purchases by people on the no-fly list. I presume you aren't on a no-fly list so your purchases wouldn't be reported, but we would have some way of determining who on the no-fly list is purchasing weapons, and we wouldn't be taking away anyone's right to purchase guns without due process.</comment>

<comment>Report them... and then what? They haven't broken a law.</comment>

<comment>Yet, they're still on the no-fly list.  </comment>

<comment>How do people get on the No Fly List?</comment>

<comment>Against it, not interested in having my gun rights tied to an arbitrary no fly list.</comment>

<comment>But you were fine having your right to travel tied to it?</comment>

<comment>There isn't a right to flight. Try again. It is funny that you leftists want to pretend Everything is a right.</comment>

<comment>I'm a liberal.  A real one.  Not a leftist.  The right to travel is a long-recognized right.  Your reasoning would allow assault weapon bans if applied to the Second Amendment.  You Rightists are just like the Leftists:  quick to jettison any right that's momentarily inconvenient to you.</comment>

<comment>False equivalent, there is no constitutional right to flight, there is for guns. You can stop pretending the two are equivalent. It is intellectual dishonesty or total ignorance for you to keep spouting that nonsense.</comment>

<comment>There is a right to travel no less than there is a right to keep and bear arms.  At issue is the extent of the right in both.  If it's reasonable and constitutional for the government to limit you to walking, it's reasonable and constitutional for them to limit you to a slingshot.After all, they aren't disarming you any more than they are keeping you from traveling.</comment>

<comment>Wrong, 2A guarantees the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. There is no such right guaranteeing the right to board a plane. You are either very ignorant or very dishonest.</comment>

<comment>This has little practical impact.  If I am a terrorist and I am on the No Fly list, I will get my patsy who is not on the list to buy the guns and ammo.  We do an abysmal job of prosecuting straw buyers so this background check stuff is like making a bullet proof vest out of cheesecloth.  And People do regularly buy cases of Ammunition in Bulk because it is way cheaper.  Also like Kurios said, if you go to a course or just like to target shoot, you can use up 1,500 rounds within 2-3 days.  With prices fluctuating so much and sometimes massive shortages, serious shooters are stockpiling tens of thousands of rounds.  Not to start a massacre but to ensure they have ammo for practice, courses, hunting, home defense, etc.</comment>

<comment>"This has little practical impact.  If I am a terrorist and I am on the No Fly list, I will get my patsy who is not on the list to buy the guns and ammo"That's why they don't want to tell people that they are on the list. Tracking loses effectiveness once the subject figures out he is being tracked. But the more things you use the list for, the more people will find out they are on it. Yet another reason this is a stupid idea, as well as an unconstitutional one.It's just Obama's knee-jerk reaction to everything. When in doubt, go for gun control. Sheesh, you'd think he could read the polls on the issue.</comment>

<comment>Shouldn't be a big deal. The agency overseeing ammunition purchases would do a quick investigation into you. Then, maybe a phone call to see what's up. If anything doesn't add up, you'd get a visit for a closer look into your activities and needs for large amounts of ammunition.</comment>

<comment>So you want a new agency with a staff big enough to personally phone or visit everyone who buys bullets in the country (federal agency, naturally). Cause you just can't think of any way to deal with violent movements other ball busting hobby shooters and raising everyone else's taxes to do it.One day, someone on the left will take serious issues seriously. Thankfully that hasn't happened yet.</comment>

<comment>"everyone who buys bullets in the country"=====Everyone who buys thousands and thousands of bullets over a given time period. And, if there's no problems, there won't be any ball busting. BTW, compared to the rest of the industrialized world, you don't pay much taxes.</comment>

<comment>It's a new government agency. To ensure that it grows it will continuously redefine downward that amount of purchase to the point where you need a visit by a staff of six if you buy a rubber band and a paper clip.  It's awful nice of you to take on the task of defining "no problems" threshold that results in ball busting. But I think I'll pass.Good luck trying to raise the taxes- make sure it's your party platform next year!</comment>

<comment>The right cries about the debt night and day, but they never actually want to take steps to pay it down. Eventually, we're going to have to pay more taxes like the rest of the industrialized world. Scandinavian nations pay MUCH higher taxes and they're some of the happiest, most healthy, long lived people in the world.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't be happy in Scandinavia, I'll keep it how it is here, you are welcome to go there if you like.</comment>

<comment>I think you can move to Scandanavia if you want. Just claim to be a Refugee from war-torn America.</comment>

<comment>Go look at the stats for social security and Medicare and govt employee pension shortfalls.  Taxes will be going up. You won't get the money, in fact it will be anti-social to be "bored in Min" or anywhere else if you are able bodied working age adult. You need to get a job that produces so you can pay for your parents' cruises. Ain't the modern welfare state grand?!?</comment>

<comment>So basically anyone who maintains firearm competency. 1000s of rounds are useless for a firefight, but great for training. One of the ex-vets I worked with laughed because you have to replace the barrel of a machine gun after 1000 rounds</comment>

<comment>Some rifles were worse.Had a Savage 220 Swift where the barrel didn't last 500 rounds before accuracy went to hell.</comment>

<comment>BS - maybe if you fire them all at once and don't let it cool down at all.  Otherwise it's in the tens of thousands.  Modern barrels are masterpieces of metallurgy.A modern pistol like a Glock with polygonal rifling will go tens of thousands of rounds before a change is necessary - and the replacement barrels are pretty cheap.</comment>

<comment>It is funny when liberals say thousands as if that is a lot. If it was millions I'd be surprised but between me and my coworker the two of us have about 30k rounds.</comment>

<comment>Fine. You'd be investigated and maybe receive a call. If there's something suspicious, you'd get a visit by local or federal officials.</comment>

<comment>and what would constitute "suspicious"?</comment>

<comment>Contact with known radicals. Run-ins with police. Domestic disputes involving police. Incidents of violence. I'm not sure but that's okay since I'm not writing the rules.</comment>

<comment>you can live in 1984 all you like but all the legislation you want is out of fear and that's no world I want to live in</comment>

<comment>If you eliminate suicides it's closer to 10,000 per year killed by crimes involving guns.There are just over 30,000 people killed by cars every year, and yet we accept that as the price of having automobiles.There are almost 450,000 killed by medical malpractice every year, yet there is no national outcry about medical malpractice.Furthermore, there are 700,000 legal abortions in the US, EVERY SINGLE YEAR, and we have collectively decided that is an acceptable price to pay for protecting women's reproductive rights.</comment>

<comment>while we're at it, lets make laws against salt in food. that kills 610,000 every year.</comment>

<comment>Under 9000, according to the FBI.  Which, in fact, is the lowest in at least a few decades. The rest are suicides, so personal choice.</comment>

<comment>With more than  half of those suicides.  We've also halved the Homicide rate without those measures.</comment>

<comment>Or just buying ammo in bulk, or for a gun the administration wants to ban, or....  Gun owners' rights have been under intermittent attack for decades.  We're all too familiar with this sort of mission creep.  Not to mention that tracking ammo sales would be a de facto gun registry and unconstitutiinal</comment>

<comment>They'd get an F you on the phone and the finger at the door just before I slammed it in their face.</comment>

<comment>You still aren't getting it.  There are upwards of 100 million gun owners in the US.  A sizable percentage do regularly buy ammo in that kind of bulk, for the reasons given above.  And, in all honesty, a terrorist doesn't need mass quantities of ammo</comment>

<comment>Anyone who shoots regularly buys "thousands and thousands" over time.Your criteria is as useless as it is odious.</comment>

<comment>There are tens of thousands of people who buy that many bullets. Not everybody lives in urban big cities.</comment>

<comment>So, you need thousands and thousands of bullets if you live in the country? Are they fighting Indian uprisings? Or, a British invasion?</comment>

<comment>The billions that we would need to spend on this could be better employed doing some good for the community. More cops in high crime hoods, hiring the hard core unemployed, better schools for our kids, better weapons and training for our cops and soldiers.  Not wasted on  useless checks.</comment>

<comment>Do the rounds have anything to do with your profession?</comment>

<comment>Nope, just maintaining a competency with firearms, so if I ever do have to use them, I can shoot straight. ( it's something a lot of law enforcement officers should consider doing...)</comment>

<comment>If coming under fire, real or simulated, target practice is useful for returning fire. I'm skeptical of the efficacy of going to your everyday range for anything more than distance shooting under controlled conditions.</comment>

<comment>Be skeptical all you like but everyone knows that practicing when you are not under fire improves your chances of success when under fire.</comment>

<comment>Possibly marginally. It would be helpful if you able to shoot the suspect from 200 yards with your rifle while he or she wasn't paying you any attention.</comment>

<comment>I am perfectly capable of shooting someone at 100 yards.</comment>

<comment>Considering your reluctance to be without a firearm I figured 100 yards would be a little close for your comfort.</comment>

<comment>Typically you shoot when you are sure you will hit the target.</comment>

<comment>Yep. You nailed it. Shooting targets under controlled conditions (And depending on what you consider good, that takes practice and effort to keep up with.) Outside of that I spend time doing friendly move and shoot courses, which are 2 gun (AR + pistol) on a controlled, timed course that makes you move between stations and fire from different positions. And that actually can be fun. Though it consumes alot of ammo all on its own. (about 150 rounds each time I do it. )An example of a move and shoot course:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>You are by definition, "well regulated militia." </comment>

<comment>then you could be checked and it would be seen you weren't a danger. Anyone who deposits over $10,000 in cash in a bank has the transaction checked, to help identify drug dealers and money laundering.  If its legiitmate, no problem.  Same with your ammo purchases.</comment>

<comment>What if my response is,"none of your fin business," and I hang up. </comment>

<comment>Hahahaha"If it's legitimate, no problem."http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10...Hahahahaha</comment>

<comment>And so one violation of rights justifies another...</comment>

<comment>You realize those money checks are questionable if not outright unconstitutional right? Especially with asset forfeiture corruption scandals in many police departments.</comment>

<comment>Control freaks just gotta control.    They can't help themselves.  Fortunately,  this personality type did not escape the Framer's notice.</comment>

<comment>Multi-thousand round purchases of ammunition are quite common among people who like to shoot and have the space to store it.  The price per round is much lower when you buy ammunition by the case rather than small retail boxes.</comment>

<comment>That's fine and their right to do so. But, it also warrants oversight since shooters like the Bernardino couple had over 6,000 rounds. It raises a red flag that should be investigated. If you have a legitimate need for that amount of ammunition and show no signs of radicalization or potential violence, have a nice day and enjoy your target practice!</comment>

<comment>How exactly does the government investigate your intent for using that ammunition? Tap your phones? Read your emails? If you once spoke with someone who has tenuous tied to financing terrorism (say, the head of CAIR), could the government confiscate the ammunition you purchased?Ammunition purchases of that size are extremely common and terrorists, if they knew this was a flag for the government, would stockpile at lower quantities. Additionally, it takes almost a dozen law-enforcement professionals to continuously monitor an individual in this country; it would require a literal police state to "follow-up" or "monitor" individuals who purchased a large quantity of ammunition.So unless you're advocating for getting rid of the 4th Amendment (you're not, are you?), what you're suggesting is unworkable and diverts resources from useful programs for combating terrorism.</comment>

<comment>Bored isn't a fan of most of the Bill of Rights</comment>

<comment>incredibly true statement</comment>

<comment>Require ammunition sales to be tied to a name and reported to a federal agency. And, how many people buy over 6,000 rounds over a few months or a couple of years?</comment>

<comment>what does 6,000 have to do with anything? you do realize a combat load in the military is typically only 180 rounds, right?</comment>

<comment>Civilians, not military. The military is responsible for policing its own forces.</comment>

<comment>okay, I don't think you get what I'm saying. why the arbitrary number 6,000? why is that when flags go up? in the Marine Corps we were issued 180 rounds (typically) per man, on missions. If the Marine Corps thinks that is sufficient for myself and my team to effectively engage the enemy and destroy him, why does it take 6,000 before a civilian can start doing damage?</comment>

<comment>I am slightly amused at the thought of a civilian lugging 6,000 rounds. Thats like 170lbs of ammo. Talk about over-prepared.</comment>

<comment>A lot. 100 rounds a week is the general minimum bar for competency.</comment>

<comment>Quite a few; too many for this to be manageable for federal, state, or local law-enforcement.But again, I pose the question, what does the government do with this information? If federal agents visited the now-suspected terrorist, wouldn't he just lie about intent? Then, maybe knowing the government was onto him, drive to the mall and pick off shoppers?</comment>

<comment>So, the answer to that question (The closest I could find)In a survey of 400 gun owners, 97 of them had greater then 5,000 rounds of ammo, or about 25%http://www.handgunforum.net/ho...Guessing about 80mil active gun owning citizenshttp://americangunfacts.com/So about 20million people have that much ammo in the USA (Based on some estimations and aggregations)</comment>

<comment>A very small sample size (400) extrapolated to a ridiculously large estimate (80mil active gun owning citizens)? I don't buy your partisan calculations.</comment>

<comment>If you can come up with better, I welcome you. But most "statistics" come from small sample sizes. The problem in this case isnt the sample size (400 is enough for national presedential polling. It gives us 95% confidence that the true result is within 4% of that number. This is basic statistics. Feel free to check my work http://www.surveysystem.com/ss... ). The actual flaw with my number is my sample is most likely biased. Which I freely admitted. Because that was the best sample I could find. The sample is from active members of the handgun community.But even if you half'd that number, 10 million is quite a few people.</comment>

<comment>Given that many people are reluctant to discuss firearms ownership with random pollsters, you can safely assume that all firearms-related survey under-report.</comment>

<comment>Figure that 80 million is significantly low. That number comes from Census Bureau surveys, and who in their right mind is telling fedgov whether or not they own guns?</comment>

<comment>Oh, that was the number of people with concealed carry prermits, as I can more likely assume they are active gun owners compared to non-permit holders.</comment>

<comment>Thousands of people, if not millions.</comment>

<comment>Fine. That's the kind of big changes that need to be made to head off the ocean of bloodshed caused by decades of eliminating gun laws.</comment>

<comment>What is the big change? You are going to run direct surveillance on millions of people simply because they buy bullets? </comment>

<comment>And what ocean of bloodshed?  Violent crime has dropped by half in the past 20 years, with firearm homicides currently at 50-year lows</comment>

<comment>Other than the idiotic and useless Assault Weapons Ban, what gun laws have been eliminated?</comment>

<comment>Millions of people, possibly 10's of millions.  And an ammo registry is unconstitutional, anyway</comment>

<comment>He is advocating getting rid of the Fourth.  And the Fifth.  Probably the Sixth as well.Because gunz...</comment>

<comment>Warrants it in your opinion.</comment>

<comment>There is no legal basis for investigating people who are engaged in activities that are not only clearly lawful, but commonplace.</comment>

<comment>At that scale of ammunition use, it's more economical to get into loading/reloading your own.That presents an issue of reporting purchases since each part needed to load a round can be bought separately, and by themselves none qualify as "ammunition" until they're all put together.</comment>

<comment>The press is the primary piece of equipment. Tracking sales of that would be effective enough.</comment>

<comment>I've seen working drawings designed for presenting to a machine shop created by a Swiss engineer that only require machining three parts and purchasing a couple of other unregulated ones (springs, fasteners).The idea was to give one page to each of three different shops, so no shop would actually know what they were helping to make. They fit together to form a very simple, very sturdy fully-automatic weapon (the Swiss are good at that). And that was published years ago.Tracking can be hard, if those being tracked don't want to be.</comment>

<comment>We can only do so much. If someone wants to go to those lengths, so be it. Hopefully, they'll slip up somewhere else and get caught.</comment>

<comment>Any car mechanic has all the tools necessary to make a gun that will work.  Not a good one, but definitely functional</comment>

<comment>Any machinist has the tools to make a very good one.</comment>

<comment>I have a press and it might be more "economical" but I value my time at 30/H minimum.</comment>

<comment>If ammo is regulated the way some folks seem to want it to be, you'll make a lot more money "on the side" with your press.</comment>

<comment>Good point.</comment>

<comment>All you are doing is harrassing honest citizens with such nonsense.</comment>

<comment>By harassment, you must mean an investigation the purchaser isn't even aware of or a quick phone call? Gee, that's really inconveniencing!</comment>

<comment>A phone call? Way to tip off a terrorist that the government knows he has a bunch of ammunition that he better go use really quickly!</comment>

<comment>He'd be watched.</comment>

<comment>So we are watching all of these ammo purchasers as well. </comment>

<comment>Those who purchase very large amounts over a given time period. If there's no red flags, there will be no further investigation.</comment>

<comment>So that is a couple million people that need watching, at least two people for each of those people plus equipment and support... yeah start a government agency consisting of around 10 million or more government workers and you might be able to surveillance all of those law abiding citizens.</comment>

<comment>I'm reporting you to the Feds.  Your posts here are suspicious.</comment>

<comment>By whom? Do the police now have to follow these people around to ensure they didn't lie to them?You are basically arguing for the introduction of the Stasi in America at this point.</comment>

<comment>You're trying to take the argument to absurd levels so you can attack it. That's pretty shameful. Instead of fighting any and all ideas to decrease the 30,000 violent gun deaths every single year, why not come up with some fresh ideas?</comment>

<comment>You're seriously arguing for police to follow around people who flag an arbitrary "ammunition value" for an indeterminate amount of time. And you don't think that's an absurd level already?Listen, you're an "ends justify the means" kind of guy. I'm not. We won't see eye to eye on this.</comment>

<comment>since 2/3rds are suicide via gun, Ammo limits won't stop that, as all they need is a single round, from a single box.Can't take that extra ammo with you to the afterlife.</comment>

<comment>There aren't 30,000 violent gun deaths.  There are under 9000 and dropping. http://www.pewsocialtrends.org...</comment>

<comment>The "quantity of ammo" discussion completely misses the point.Unless you have a squad of 4 or more soldiers trained in crew-served weapons, massive arsenals are useless after the first few hundred rounds. No person can carry that amount of ammo.Also, Police response will generally overwhelm a single or small number of shooters in a period of time well before they get to the thousands of rounds.In all of these active shooter situations, I keep seeing reports of massive stockpiles of bullets, which, ahem, never get used and are found by the police afterward.If you want to make a pro- or anti- gun argument, go ahead, but whichever side you take, focusing on the quantity of bullets after the first few hundred is silly.</comment>

<comment>I bought over 1,000 rounds today alone in .223 for my AR-15. </comment>

<comment>you must be a terrorist...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I ate more than the recommended serving size of pineapple last night too, I should probably get a call and an investigation for that, could be a terrorist. ;)</comment>

<comment>Ideally, that should have been reported to a government agency that would do an investigation into you. If they don't find anything that raises red flags, they'll let it go.</comment>

<comment>so you want racial profiling? since, historically white males buy more ammunition than other populations, the legislation you're proposing disproportionately affects white males.</comment>

<comment>That's a big stretch, Utah. Maybe rethink and come back with a better argument.</comment>

<comment>That wouldn't be ideal, well maybe in your fantasy world it would be. </comment>

<comment>Not positive, but I think CA does track ammo purchases, actually</comment>

<comment>They should flip the argument: Legislate that everyone on the No-Fly List MAY buy guns.</comment>

<comment>my head hurts</comment>

<comment>Advil</comment>

<comment>It makes no earthly sense to a logical mind that someone who is on the no fly list is allowed to buy a gun! Obviously that person is on that list for a reason so why in Gods name should they be allowed to buy a WMD? As WMD's are exactly what all guns are. Only a complete fool would think it's a good idea to allow such people to buy guns of any kind in any number.</comment>

<comment>If there is always a good reason for any person to be on the terrorism watch list, why are all of those people not simply rounded up and incarcerated?If they can't be trusted to buy a civilian sporting firearm, they can't be trusted to drive a car or shop at Walmart where all of the materials needed to make improvised explosive devices can be acquired easily and anonymously.</comment>

<comment>We are not talking about a civilian buying a sporting firearm! We are talking AK47's and the like. That's NOT a sporting firearm, far from it unless the killing of humans is now classed as sport! What driving a car to Walmart has to do with being on a watch list beats me!!</comment>

<comment>We are also talking about rights and due process of law. It is easy to take away rights when people are angry or scared. It is much harder to regain them.</comment>

<comment>What rights are being taken away exactly? The 2nd amendment is still in tact that hasn't gone anywhere and never will. Of course in the minds of some gun advocates the mere mention of background checks sends them into a frenzy! 2nd amendment has been and will continue to be used and abused. Gone is what it was designed to do and that is to protect ones self or ones home. A gun is now to be taken everywhere under the sun, what could possibly go wrong there if an argument breaks out in a room full of people?</comment>

<comment>An AK-47 is just a rifle like any other. The "assault" designation is a cosmetic one, nothing more.AK's aren't the only weapon that fire 7.62 and the AR-15 isn't the only rifle that fires .223. Some look like "sporting" firearms, and can accept large-cap magazines, but again it's merely a cosmetic difference.</comment>

<comment>Here come the excuses for AK-47's. I knew it was coming and sure enough here they come one after another.</comment>

<comment>This is like when I try to explain concepts like fascism, socialism, Stalinism and capitalism to a conservative and they don't really care about the details, they just want their slogans and memes.  But they really care about details like these, involving long guns and short guns.</comment>

<comment>The great, great granfather of the AK-47 was the Remington Model 8, first made in 1906.It was a magazine fed autoloader that fired what would now be called an Intermediate Rifle Cartridge.It was a well liked Deer Rifle back in the day.Texas Ranger Frank Hamer used one to kill Bonnie and Clyde</comment>

<comment>That was very informative. However that doesn't change the fact that an AK-47 is not a gun needed by anyone other than police and the military.</comment>

<comment>And is needed by deer hunters. And those who want to defend themselves.You don't get to say what others 'need'</comment>

<comment>What does need have to do with it?  What's the necessity for banning a rifle rarely used in gun crimes?</comment>

<comment>Facts aren't excuses.</comment>

<comment>Oh please!</comment>

<comment>Well that sure was compelling; I'm convinced that due to their external appearance, AK-47's have the magical ability to kill more people than other rifles that lack such cosmetic signifiers of projected lethality. I mean, it's only rational...</comment>

<comment>That you're ignorant about guns doesn't make basic facts "excuses."</comment>

<comment>Cool, so why buy an Ak-47 if it's no different than any other gun that can fire the same ammo?</comment>

<comment>AKs were a lot cheaper than the Ruger Ranch Rifle</comment>

<comment>Well, it's more reliable than many rifles (in terms of what it can handle without misfiring, assuming it's not a cheap knock-off from a country not known for making them). Replacement parts are cheap and plentiful since it's the most common rifle in the world. And of course the appearance is a draw for those drawn to that kind of appearance.</comment>

<comment>AK-47s are sporting firearms, otherwise they couldn't be imported into the USAhttps://www.atf.gov/file/57521...Under 18 U.S.C. section 925(d)(3), the Secretary shall approve applications for importation only when the firearms are generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes (the “sporting purposes test”).</comment>

<comment>What kind of animal do you intend to kill if you need an AK-47? I guess a dinosaur would fit the bill.  Looks like another excuse just to add the adaptability to sporting purposes so the evil things can still be sold as harmless weapons. It's disgusting.</comment>

<comment>I don't have an AK, but do a SKS, and its great for shooting coyotes in Minnesota.Ammo is cheap and effective, as was the Rifle. A while ago, were selling under $200, and a box of ammo is around $4-5 on sale..And no weapon is harmless.It's kind of the whole point of the tool</comment>

<comment>You are quite right no weapon is harmless. That's why they shouldn't be allowed to be bought so easily. No one needs an arsenal of guns and there maybe some out there who have a whole garage full of them as one more gun can never hurt!</comment>

<comment>An AK-47 isn't a high-powered rifle.  No assault rifle is, and derivatives of assault rifles- like the civilian version of the AK- are, either.It's a 7.62 mm rifle, which is a good round for hunting animals the size of most deer.  I wouldn't recommend it for hunting moose or elk: it's not powerful enough.Unreasonable fears rooted in ignorance aren't valid bases for legislation or regulation.</comment>

<comment>Humans are the most dangerous game after all...</comment>

<comment>AnnieOMG's comment makes no sense whatsoever.AK47s and the like are not available in sporting goods stores or other legal sources in the USA.  They are sold illegally on the black market, from one criminal to another.  Those transactions are not subject to the background checks that are required for all original sales of firearms in this country.</comment>

<comment>Uh...neither does yours.  AK-47's are perfectly legal in any state that does not have an ugly gun...er...."assault weapon" ban.</comment>

<comment>That is not correct.  Selective-fire military weapons like the AK-47s used in the recent terrorist attack in Paris have been regulated in all 50 states under the National Firearms Act since 1934.  There are no functional differences between a semiautomatic AK knockoff made for the US civilian market and any other semiautomatic sporting rifle, such as a Ruger Mini-14, which is available in every state including California.People who use military weapons to commit heinous crimes don't buy them through lawful channels.  The background checks performed on civilian arms sales in the US do not apply to the activities of gun-runners.But in the larger picture it's clear that the people who are promoting the idea of incorporating the terror watch list into the set of checks done on prospective gun buyers are nothing but knee-jerk gun control fanatics.  The idea is a non-starter on Constitutional grounds because there is no avenue of appeal for people who find themselves listed as terror suspects.  We don't use mere suspicion as grounds for denying people the exercise of their civil rights in this country.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is a sporting firearm, and they are used for hunting.  But any deer rifle would get the job done just as well.(An AK47 is NOT any sort of machine gun)</comment>

<comment>It's very much a sporting firearm, and it's less powerful than many other hunting rifles.</comment>

<comment>Those on that List are working for Homeland Security, right now.72 of them.</comment>

<comment>At long last, we finally found the Iraqi WMDs!  Turns out they were in the hands of every member of the military and police force all along.Next up, we go after the WMD owning Swiss.  They might look like chocolate lovers with a banking system, but I've got a double super secret special probation list of these lovers of holey cheese and haters of freedom.</comment>

<comment>You are welcome to your opinion.  But you still don't get to violate people's rights wuthout due process, and the gov't is already losing in court over the no-fly list's lack thereof</comment>

<comment>Ted Kennedy was oddly on the no-fly list for awhile.  But he was in favor of banning semiautomatic weapons ENTIRELY.  So this wouldn't be a problem for him.  Kennedy was once described by the NRA as having cast more anti-gun votes than anyone in history (God bless him!)  Watching these NRA stooges drag his name into their pathetic pandering to gun merchants is sickening.</comment>

<comment>Obama's statements about "assault weapons" sounded like he thought that even California's laws weren't strict enough.  Any proposal to impose California-style gun laws would be laughed out of Congress instantly.</comment>

<comment>Nothing new here. Just look at the history of US-Soviet relations in the 70s.</comment>

<comment>I haven't agreed with Conservarives on much lately but I do agree that no constitutional rights should be taken without due process of law.</comment>

<comment>The question at hand is whether its a constitutional right to amass an arsenal of battlefield weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition or not.</comment>

<comment>Thousands of rounds was meaningless, since most was left at home.You can't carry thousands of rounds on your person and still be an effective shooter.And ARs aren't 'Battlefield Weapons' not being full auto</comment>

<comment>The purchase of thousands of rounds can be tied to an individual and tracked.</comment>

<comment>Ammo doesn't do anything, by itself.It just sits in boxes.Intent of the owner, that's a different story.Maybe pay attention to that, instead</comment>

<comment>That's exactly what investigation and maybe an interview with the purchaser would reveal - intent.</comment>

<comment>2nd & 4th Amendment.Sorry.You don't have to justify purchases to Government agents over things covered by the Bill of Rights</comment>

<comment>Come on now. The 2nd Amendement doesn't cover the unlimited, untracked purchase of ammunition and there is no unreasonable search in tracking ammo purchases. You have NO inalienable right to purchase a gun or ammo. Its a privilege if you qualify.</comment>

<comment>actually it does.The Federal Government can't track ammo purchases, and need warrants to show retailers if they want records.</comment>

<comment>Once the national gun registry and ammo tracking program is passed into law, law enforcement will have highly effective tools for preventing gun violence in the U.S.</comment>

<comment>What makes you think it would get passed thru the House and Senate, and then get past SCOTUS?</comment>

<comment>The Senate will be Dem controlled in 2016. Though several seats are likely to go Dem, the House will be the tough fight. And, Hillary will be replacing Ginsburg, Kennedy and Scalia as they retire. The cards are lining up to take meaningful action.</comment>

<comment>If we can't get it done now, our children will do it.  They will have fresh memories of being raised with school lock-down drills and will need a cause to rebel against their parents over and define themselves by.</comment>

<comment>your naivety is heart breaking</comment>

<comment>The NRA won't be able to control the national gun discussion for much longer.</comment>

<comment>maybe not but if you think what you just suggested is going to stop gun violence in this country then you're incredibly naive. i know you've commented on here before that you're old but admittedly, a lot of your opinions and posts would lead one to believe you're a very intelligent but incredibly naive college age student.</comment>

<comment>I'm well beyond college age and well informed. The laws can be changed and violence significantly decreased. All it takes is the will to do it.</comment>

<comment>laws don't stop a will or desire to commit violence against one another. this logic is the same failed logic applied to the war on terror. the terrorists in San Bernardino obtained their firearms illegally, as do so many others that use them to commit harm to their fellow man.</comment>

<comment>Some of them were purchased legally, via online purchases from deep discount outlets.  The other guns were on loan from a neighbor who purchased them legally, and just checked himself into a mental health facility.  As luck would have it.</comment>

<comment>do you have a link so I can read about the neighbor?</comment>

<comment>Sure.  I heard it on NPR this morning and they are slow to report because they tend to check their facts first.  I tried to post two "links" but Disqus is eating them.  There are articles in the Daily Mail and International Business times, covering Enrique Marquez (the neighbor).</comment>

<comment>Thanks Serena</comment>

<comment>also, it's Enrique Marquez</comment>

<comment>Yes, I fixed it, thanks.</comment>

<comment>No problem.</comment>

<comment>change dot com to .Com and you should be OK</comment>

<comment>I suspect his checking into a facility has more to do with what they did with his rifles than something else.</comment>

<comment>By george, you're right! Concealed carry laws have been liberalized steadily over the past 20 years and homicides by gun have decreased 50% over the same period! Why, it's almost as if people being able to defend themselves somehow inhibits criminal behavior.http://www.aei.org/publication...</comment>

<comment>You are not well-informed, but you make up for that with passion and unreasonable fears.</comment>

<comment>Canada had a universal national gun registry for a while.  It cost 100x what it was supposed to and it did not solve a single solitary crime.  Not a one, as the RCMP admitted.  but government contractors pocketed over C$2 billion, and millions of random Canadians were turned into criminals.</comment>

<comment>Gun registries are unconstitutional</comment>

<comment>I don't think so, and I oppose them.  Given the politics of guns, I can't support them, but it seems to me both the states and the Feds can justify registration under their respective militia powers.But I don't trust disarmanuts.</comment>

<comment>It does.  Tracking ammo purchases is a de facto gun registry, because the feds are tracking what caliber of guns you own</comment>

<comment>How about the pipe bombs?</comment>

<comment>Can't do much about that. Seems that they can be tricky to work with since they didn't detonate for the San Bernardino couple.</comment>

<comment>The SCOTUS has already settled that one.  It is.</comment>

<comment>Conservatives don't really agree with that though. Sure, they are fighting against taking away the right to bear arms without due process of law, but they're fine with taking away the right to fly without due process of law, and they're fine with imprisoning suspected terrorists without due process of law. I agree with you that we should not take away any rights without due process, but conservatives do not agree.</comment>

<comment>Really? If Congress passed a law tomorrow making air travel illegal and a criminal act, that law would be constitutional, in your opinion? What about car travel--suppose Congress also outlawed cars or any other form of automobile. Would all of these laws be constitutional? I don't think the answer is yes.</comment>

<comment>I think those things would be found constitutional.  Guns are a government recognized right because they are explicitly called out in the constitution not simply because they violate your more nebulous pursuit of happiness.  We infringe that all the frigging time.</comment>

<comment>I disagree, but the no-fly list is an even easier example than the examples above, because it singles out certain people for exclusion. The 14th Amendment guarantees both due process and equal protection of the laws. Denying some people access to air travel, without due process, is a violation of both provisions. Similarly, a law providing that "no Christians may fly" or "no Republicans may fly" would be unconstitutional as an equal protection violation, even though there is no enumerated right to fly. At least in my opinion.</comment>

<comment>I agree any such profiling that goes on to be put on the list would also violate the equal protection clause.  Though I don't think that is involved in the process used to place someone on there.</comment>

<comment>What militia do you belong to and is it "well regulated"?</comment>
