<comment>Oh Esther, you need to attend more Bible study."For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil"1 Timothy 6:10</comment>

<comment>The "love of money" is source of evil, not money itself. </comment>

<comment>A more fitting headline for this piece might have been 'The Left Finds Recourse Via Citizen Initiatives.'The news is not that big money plays an active role in American politics. The story is that progressives still have some tools to overcome gerrymandered districts, voter ID laws, big money campaign donors, and lobby groups like ALEC via direct appeal to those voters who feel disenfranchised by their elected officials. And it is refreshing to know that there are some significant successes through the voter initiative process.</comment>

<comment>Odd how the Left has no "lobbying groups" isn't it? They certainly have the money, and they certainly use it to influence policy-making, but somehow we never hear about Progressive 'lobbying' or 'lobbying groups'.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>Then shouldn't their ballot initiatives be equally out of touch and fail just as hard?The Republicans (and the reliably patrician Atlantic) are the ones who seem concerned that they don't have a one-stop shop for thwarting these kinds of things and that people are allowed to vote directly on them. It's the old "Republic, not a democracy" line.On the other hand, this might not be good for the Democrats in the long run. Trump is showing a lot of people support some liberal positions but are viscerally opposed to anything labeled "liberalism." If they can circumvent the rough edges of Republican orthodoxy via direct democracy, why bother with the Democrats?ETA an example would be Illinois, of all places, where in 2014 we voted both to increase the minimum wage via referendum and to elect a Republican governor who wanted to lower our existing minimum wage.</comment>

<comment>"ETA an example would be Illinois, of all places, where in 2014 we voted both to increase the minimum wage via referendum and to elect a Republican governor who wanted to lower our existing minimum wage."That's kind of hilarious. But also weirdly awesome, democratically speaking.</comment>

<comment>I suspect a lot of minimum wage supporters are not single issue voters.  The Republican might have won because of other reasons like character or even other issues that are more prominent.</comment>

<comment>right. I'd suggest very few if any minimum wage supporters are single issue voters.Illinois also a special case. You have a long history of governor corruption, as well as inept fiscal/budget management of the state. Lots of people may want to raise the minimum wage, but not necessarily want a machine Democrat to run the state.</comment>

<comment>Oh, California can top that. In the same election we made it possible for the legislature to pass a budget with a simple majority and made it impossible to raise taxes or fees without a super-majority in the legislature and a majority of statewide voters.Morons.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't seem like there's anything uniquely un-democratic about these, based on this article. Candidates themselves have been propped up by outside moneyed interests, non-citizen started ballot initiatives are often put there at the behest of lobbyists, and, of course, many campaigns spend plenty to increase turnout beneficial to them, often in a far more direct form (like sponsoring shuttles to take voters to their polling place).I don't love ballot initiatives (California, for instance, has a particularly ridiculous form of it that made them susceptible to outside pressure), but you don't get one passed just by spending money and encouraging it to be passed. The voters still have to get into the booth and vote for it. That's the democracy part. Who cares how the voters were motivated to show up? That's not anti-democratic. If John Doe shows up because he wants to legally get high, or he saw a disturbing ad on TV, or because his dog told him to, that's his call, regardless of how stupid and/or crazy it is.Or, perhaps, this is just an article talking about how another state apparatus has been outfoxed by big national concerns and it's fallen victim to another headline writer with poor reading comprehension.</comment>

<comment>Nebraska's legislature outlawed the death penalty, so the Governor and his father basically self-funded a petition to put the issue on the ballot. Just saying that conservatives do it too, even pro-death penalty Catholic conservatives.</comment>

<comment>Aw, you beat me to it.</comment>

<comment>Next time you read about the NRA's "gun lobby money," refer to the amount that Bloomberg, MDA, Everytown, etc. have spent on ballot initiatives - the spending dwarfs all forms of lobbying by NRA-ILA (its political wing). The amount of money that I so often hear has "corrupted the system" in modern politics flows from both sides, and the left is as guilty as the folks across the aisle, arguably more so on some issues.</comment>

<comment>Californian here- I HATE BALLOT MEASURES. That is all.</comment>

<comment>I've heard that your ballot initiative system is completely messed up, doesn't it take like 3 people and 20 bucks to get something on the ballot there?</comment>

<comment>It's a little tougher, but not that hard.  The signatures are the tougher part:"A ballot proposition enacted by the initiative process can alter the Constitution of California, the California Codes, or another law in the California Statutes. An initiative is brought about by writing a proposed law as a petition, and submitting the petition to the California Attorney General along with a submission fee (in 2004 this was $200), and obtaining signatures on petitions from registered voters amounting to 8 percent (for an amendment to the state constitution) or 5 percent (for a statute) of the number of people who voted in the most recent election for governor. The signed petitions are then sent to the Secretary of State of California for validation of signatures."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>No, it's actually very expensive, which is the main reason why the ballot initiative process has been co-opted by deep-pocket interests. It might actually be better if all it took was three people and twenty bucks. But right now, it takes millions, so it's a game of millionaires.</comment>

<comment>I'm wondering about that ballot initiative the author claims passed in Illinois in 2014. Illinois law does not provide for state-wide ballot initiatives.</comment>

<comment>As a Californian, I encourage everyone to hold their frigging horses on this whole ballot proposition thing. Look at us! Look at how f*cked up our budget is! All because of propositions and their mandated spending!Proposition 13 fundamentally and radically redefined the state's tax structure, and even though it is roundly considered a failure of policy that has led directly to the budgeting woes of the last decade and a half, it is a boon to moneyed interests and retired people, and so remains in place for over thirty years.Perhaps the best example is California's Proposition 8: Prop 8 was a 2008 ballot measure responding to a California Supreme Court ruling that Proposition 22 -- a ban on same-sex marriage -- was unconstitutional. The measure -- primarily funded by out-of-state interests, and most especially by the Church of Latter-Day Saints -- was essentially a re-removal, overturning the court's ruling by simply doing the same thing again afterward. The measure passed by about 600,000 votes (3.5% of eligible voters in the state). And, most famously, the measure led directly to the legitimization and legalization of same-sex marriage across the nation once it was challenged.So, yeah. Think twice.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  It's hugely expensive and hugely wasteful.  And many times the consequences (both intended and otherwise) of ballot measures are not obvious.Moreover, because most people are not trained in statutory construction and cannot easily evaluate those consequences.  Thus most end up just looking at which groups and individuals endorse or oppose, then vote accordingly.For this reason, the process is also ripe for manipulation.  Most organizations that can afford the $30-50 million it costs to get something on the ballot are doing so because of financial interests, whatever the flowery title the measure and its front groups carry.</comment>

<comment>The problem with ballot measures is that many issues do not lend themselves to a simple yes or no answer. That's especially true when spending is involved. For example, a measure to cut a state income tax is unwise, because it doesn't address where any lost revenue might come from or what services might be cut. That's the sort of issue best left to legislatures who can weigh the potential risks and benefits.</comment>

<comment>The legislature can decide where the cuts come from.  Imagine if we could have national ballot initiatives.  We could have one demanding a 25% cut in military spending.  Or an immediate withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.</comment>

<comment>I don't know, that sounds like a recipe for a reactionary rather than proactive government. It might be workable if the people responsible for such a program were very careful but the minute one or both of the parties figured out how to work such a system in their favor then the whole thing would blow up in our faces.  Politicians who care more about reelection than good govenance are why we can't have nice things.</comment>

<comment>You might as well ask how democratic our elected representatives are - or do you think their campaigns are never funded with out-of-state money?Also, as an Oregonian, I resent your implication in paragraph 10 that Oregon somehow swept to the right just before those ballot measures were passed. Oregon is, and has mostly remained for some time, a politically moderate, if blue-leaning, state with a strong preference for civil liberties and a surprisingly effective bipartisan state legislature. We had a Democratic governor at that time, and one senator from each of the two major parties working in Washington. This is the same setup we've had for decades.</comment>

<comment>Do note that only left-wing ballot measures have a hope of having lasting effects. The judiciary and the bureaucracy are primed to invalidate any non-far-left-wing measure that might somehow pass. See, e.g., http://www.the-american-intere...</comment>

<comment>Everything from women's suffrage and direct election of senators to minimum wages and sunshine laws to renewable energy mandates and medical and legal marijuana started as ballot initiatives. They can be easily improved, to make them less costly and more deliberative:1. 25 states allow voter registration and change of address on the Secretary of State or other website. It would be easy to allow signing petitions the same way. This would save the Secretary of State a lot of money and time comparing physical signatures, allow initiative campaigns without a lot of money to hire signature gatherers to get on the ballot, encourage people to read initiative texts online before signing, and reduce harassment for petition signatures.2. For 3 election cycles Oregon has had Citizen Initiative Review, with randomly selected citizen juries holding public hearings, taking expert testimony and deliberating, all on video, so that voters get the same kind of information that legislators get. The cost of this could be paid for by the savings to the state of not having to compare so many physical signatures. Http://healthydemocracy.org3. If online petitioning results in more initiatives on the ballot, the solution is what Switzerland does: hold up to 4 votes a year.4. These improvements can be attained by using the ballot initiative process itself."What government is best? That which teaches us to govern ourselves." - Goethe</comment>

<comment>The gun control measures especially seem like a waste of time.  If one passes, it'll inevitably get challenged in court, and the state's governor (learning from the ballot initiatives banning SSM) simply won't defend it.</comment>

<comment>A lot of Nebraskans worked hard to get that minimum wage initiative done.  By all means though, lets perpetuate the idea that it was something imposed on us by liberal coastal people. Frankly, it is far better to have a ballot measure voted on by the people of a state than crappy fill in the blank legislation from ALEC getting passed through our state legislatures.</comment>

<comment>California's Prop 209 eliminated racism in college admissions. That is something the legislature wouldn't have fixed.</comment>

<comment>Yes, voter initiatives are flawed, but the real problem is that America has never faced the truth that its democracy is as much as sham as Iranian democracy. We keep thinking that the problem is "process," so we keep inventing ever more complexity (run-off elections, ranked choice, etc.). But the problem is really "people."The problem is that the rich plunder us. That's what we need to change. Changing the rules under which the rich plunder us doesn't do anything. But we are a long ways away from understanding that at such a level that we stand up and don't allow it anymore.</comment>

<comment>Ballot initiatives helped make California a big mess.</comment>
