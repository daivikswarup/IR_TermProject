<comment>Hillary Clinton's Modest Infrastructure ProposalShe's going to build a highway out of unwanted Irish children? Because she's about to run into a major supply problem.</comment>

<comment>Irish children are so 19th Century, get with the times, Harvey. It's all about unwanted Mexican babies now.</comment>

<comment>I wish I had posted this :-)</comment>

<comment>Big numbers are exciting and scary, but could we please put things in perspective?  $275 billion over five years sounds BIGBIGBIG but is only large outside of context.  That is what, about 1.5% of the budget over the next five years, or about 0.3% of the GDP.    Please put larger numbers in perspective.</comment>

<comment>And compared to the 'Defense' Dept. budget?....</comment>

<comment>Actually get rid of the F-35 fighter jet program and you can triple the investment Clinton wants to make.</comment>

<comment>The major shortfall with infrastructure is not funding but the time and paperwork to accomplish these projects</comment>

<comment>Well, that's certainly a better investment for the money than Trump's ridiculous wall.</comment>

<comment>in one week from the Atlantic we have:lets tear down infrastructure:  http://www.theatlantic.com/bus...to now:    $275 billion of new infrastructure isnt enough from above</comment>

<comment>Oh no! Now how are we going to decide what to think?</comment>

<comment>Not so much tear down infrastructure as, "We're replacing this anyway, does it make sense to keep it here just because it's been here for the past 50 years or does it make sense to put it somewhere else given the city has changed alot since then?"  Nuance matters.</comment>

<comment>And your point is what?   Oh, there wasn't one - I get it now.</comment>

<comment>'Still there' but not thinking, huh?</comment>

<comment>You missed a perfectly good opportunity to mention her heroic dodging of sniper fire on a Bosnian tarmac. </comment>

<comment>Not opposing it but opposing her lack of confidence. The only reason Sanders won't get the nomination is the DNC machine, paid for by Wall Street.</comment>

<comment>I've have a weird (not serious) theory that American politics became less mature from 1992 onwards  in part because there was no Soviet Union around, especially for the party whose specialty was dealing successfully with the Soviets.</comment>

<comment>Your theory works. I was stationed in West Germany at the peak of the Reagan buildup, and every culture was striving to preserve itself: Germans worked hard at being German, Italians at being Italian, and so on.After the wall came down, they gave it up. No more threat, much of Europe quickly descended into hedonism.</comment>

<comment>The left's best hope is that Hillary's democratic mediocrity beats out the proposed republican incompetence and intransigence.When 2009 started, I would have been ecstatic with mediocrity.</comment>

<comment>In other news, the next batch of Clinton emails bumps her number of classified emails on her private server to just shy of 1000.</comment>

<comment>And your point is what? Oh, there wasn't one.</comment>

<comment>It's hard to see a point with your head in the sand.</comment>

<comment>"There was no classified information on the private server."--Hillary ClintonWell, for one thing, this constitutes nearly 1,000 lies . . . so far.</comment>

<comment>Once more Ms. Clinton endorses the status quo with an anemic answer to pressing needs. America needs infrastructure upgrades America needs well paying jobs. We also have a huge surplus of unemployed young men and women, yet the status quo supporters would rather feed the bloated MIC than our upcoming generations.</comment>

<comment>Yep, we need another FDR, not another Ronald Reagan.</comment>

<comment>At this point, Hillary is basically co-presidenting with Obama. The election will serve only to gauge how much of a mandate she'll have after she's sworn in.</comment>

<comment>We lost the last great GOP advocate for public toilets when Larry Craig resigned, then unresigned, and then just went away.</comment>

<comment>Sure, sure, the working class wants to pay more taxes to pay the public debt the Democrat party has run up over the last eighty years. The Democrats get elected by promising to spend, relying on someone else to balance the budget.</comment>

<comment>Except the GOP spends more on average because they pretend all their programs can be paid for with tax cuts</comment>

<comment>And you're 'working class'?  You need to think a bit more and look at Fox News a bit less.http://www.marketwatch.com/sto...'Since 1945, American voters have swung back and forth between both parties: seven Democratic presidents and nine Republican ones. Economic growth in real terms (in other words adjusted for inflation) averaged 2.54% per year under Republican presidents, but 4.35% per year under Democratic ones. That annual difference of 181 basis points, say Alan Blinder and Mark Watson, the two economics professors at Princeton who conducted the study, really adds up over time. It means that real GDP expanded 18.6% during a “typical Democratic four-year term, but only by 10.6% during a typical Republican term.” Adding more fuel to the argument, The Economist notes that better job creation and stock market performance also coincide more with Democratic presidents than Republican ones.'</comment>

<comment>You are conveniently ignoring the lag effect. It takes time for policies to trickle down:deregulation and tax cuts by Reagan fed the dot.com bubble that Clinton took credit for. Likewise, Bush's mortgage changes fed the housing boom Clinton grinned about.</comment>

<comment>Actually it's way too much.The problem is Hillary doesn't want an upgrade to infrastructure, she wants money funneled to groups that are friendly to her candidacy. If she's serious about  infrastructure let her come out with a proposal that eliminates Davis Bacon (union wage) laws, minority set asides, and limit environmental reviews to a single one-stop review for all federally funded projects.If she'll agree to limiting the amount of cash to goes to Democratically friendly groups instead of infrastructure then I'll believe she wants new infrastructure. Until then it's just an appeal to give federal cash to those who are likely to give kickbacks to the Clinton Global Initiative or her campaign. Oh, and she'll give the public a few baubles in the form of roads, ports, and bridges as a way of saying thanks.</comment>

<comment>he has a point about that buckland due tho</comment>

<comment>cannot make a reasoned reply.</comment>

<comment>You're confused there, Buckland. Its the conservative Republicans who want power so they can cut taxes and regulation on corporations that funnel them campaign cash.</comment>

<comment>So you say, based on absolutely nothing.</comment>

<comment>It's telling how successful the GOP has been in demonizing spending, that a proposal that it less than 20% of what needs to be spent generates backlash.Infrastructure is not political....road and bridges don't ask about the political views of the people who use them.Meanwhile, the Pentagon budget continues to grow ad naseum with nary a peep....</comment>

<comment>"Government small enough to drown in a bathtub" was laughed at by most educated Americans while taken dead serious by right wing conservative economic jihadists.</comment>

<comment>I don't know... Christie managed to make a bridge very political.</comment>

<comment>The nation's infrastructure is in terrible condition. Just try driving on any interstate highway. At least Hillary Clinton is willing to start addressing the issue.</comment>

<comment>It’s hard to call a plan that spends $275 billion in taxpayer dollars over five years “modest” and keep a straight face. . . And when added to the nearly $300 billion Congress is poised to authorize in a new highway billI wouldn't say it's inappropriate to refer to spending roughly 3% of the federal budget (assuming Congress's part is also spread out over five years) on what I would call a core government function as "modest".</comment>

<comment>What's amazing is that this story will get 1/20 of the coverage anything on ISIL will get yet the real threat to America is our crumbling infrastructure. Think about how many good paying jobs we would create spending that money destined for the desert on our roads and bridges and sewers. Think about how this might save you 5 minutes on your commute home. How come we can (sort of) agree on bombing ISIL etc - yet they can't agreed that we need to fix our own issues at home and asap.</comment>

<comment>I find it hilarious that we can talk about "the end of an austerity ear in Congress" with a straight face.  The fact is that the Republicans have never given a crap about deficits or austerity unless there is a Democrat in the White House.  Now that they think they have a chance at the Presidency, suddenly we have all the money in the world for tax cuts and the Pentagon (but not, it seems, for roads and bridges).</comment>

<comment>No, you see, for roads and bridges, we give tax cuts for the rich, and then issue bonds for them to buy so that we can get the money back. Slick, huh.</comment>

<comment>The next President and Senate need to push through a 2 trillion dollar package including at least 500 billion for infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>And we need to find a bipartisan way to pay for it, which means that both sides need to feel the pain.</comment>

<comment>Just create pure debt. It will be paid back 100x over the next century.</comment>

<comment>No wisdom in going into debt, especially considering how deep we are already.We could pay for it by giving up soda and beer for a few months. The money is there.</comment>

<comment>We aren't deep in debt.</comment>

<comment>Mint  some trillion dollar platinum coins. Deposit them in the Treasury's account at the Fed, and start writing checks.Inflation? No, just an end run around the money-as-debt creating commercial banks.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>This is a non-partisan necessity. How to pay for it is in question but there is no doubt that we need to upgrade our infrastructure, which will also create blue collar jobs that cannot be outsourced.Ted Koppel has an important book out about the national security weakness of our power grid for instance.</comment>

<comment>Another article at Dollars and Sense Magazine lays out the Sanders' plan; it amounts to $3.8 trillion over 10 years, that's $380 billion a year for 10 years. http://www.dollarsandsense.org...So that is $105 billion more in one year than Clinton's total program over five years. Clinton's plan is 7% the size of Sanders' plan. I hope this registers on our minds. Sanders' plan is also a full employment plan. It will add 4.5 million to 7 million more jobs to the economy, enough to bring the employment to population ratio up to the 2007 level. The E/P ratio is now at a 38 year low. With full employment wages rise as employers are pressured to raise wages to keep employees from taking higher paid work. So  80% of the workers will benefit. This plan is the biggest and best thing about the Sanders' candidacy in my opinion. The Sanders' plan is not all infrastructure, it is also universsal pre-K, Social Security enhancement, college tuition, paid leave from work for illness and family necessities, youth jobs, and private pensions, according to the article at D and S. It will increase the cost of the federal government from 17% of GDP to 18.5%, well below the cost in year 2000. I write the blog Economics Without Greed, http://benL8.blogspot.com</comment>

<comment>Easy to pay for. Add a 5% tax to every dollar after the first million. This will pay for about half a trillion. The new infrastructure will make it much easier for the private sector to invest in their own infrastructure if they know the roads, bridges, highways and electrical grids are all in good long term shape.However it's done, this is the most important issue to move us forward.</comment>

<comment>Loath as I am to agree with Hillary, $275 billion is probably about right -- assuming that we cut out the ludicrous "environmental" "reviews", outlaw lawsuits against infrastructure development, and repeal Taft-Hartley.</comment>

<comment>More weak tea, as O'Malley would say.... this is, unfortunately, typical New Democrat / DLC malarkey ... mediocrity and modest proposals that can be used for political gain when the other side opposes it. Like Obama she is starting out at the 50 years line and taunting the GOP essentially daring them to resist something that is so milquetoast, so blah, so ineffectual. That way she can try to portray the Republicans as unreasonable and use that to score political points with the electorate. Meanwhile, nothing gets done.We need a revolution, people! No more weak half-measures! We need Bernie in 2016!#FEELTHEBERN</comment>

<comment>Spend, spend and steal....this is all bogus and insanity--Hilary Clinton is under FBI investigation and she is talking about trillion dollars spending spree's---No Hilary--your will not be elected... almost 70% of Americans do not trust you, consider you a liar and hate your guts...Clinton is by far the most dishonest liar and criminal to ever serve in politics. We have had enough lies and socialism with Obozoz the Islamic anti-American pig--so Clinton can take her Saul Alinsky Transformation agenda to prison--she is not qualified to even think of running for president--Name one accomplishment please---one major accomplishment...</comment>

<comment>Name your accomplishments Hilary, all of these years freeloading off the backs of the tax payers, you must have some accomplishments to tell us about...Hilary Clinton is a con--she is a pathological liar and career felon....The Clintons are the most corrupt dishonest evil people to ever serve, in our government.  Hilary Clinton can not be trusted--</comment>
