<comment>Pictures of deformed babies.That's it. That's all you need to know. If you're attitude is, we won't have nearly as many deformed babies as Brazil, you've already lost the public opinion fight. One junk science article and a weak correlation has resulted in educated parents not vaccinating their kids. I'm NOT suggesting panic, but this response won't fly when pictures of funny looking American babies (and not in a good way) go viral.</comment>

<comment>There is no vaccine at this date.</comment>

<comment>I know. I was referring to the autism - anti-vaccination movement as a model of how people will react and what the government should not do.</comment>

<comment>So if I were thinking of having a baby, I would be putting that off for a couple of years until a vaccine is developed. Unfortunately for those already pregnant, being cautious and nervous would be understandable.</comment>

<comment>This would be a major overreaction if you live in the continental US.  There have been no documented local transmissions of the disease here.</comment>

<comment>Is it Zika 'Virus' or Pesticides and Birth Defects?http://www.globalresearch.ca/i...</comment>

<comment>What are they not saying ?  Are they not saying this super skeeter was an experiment gone wrong ?</comment>

<comment>"She said she discussed Zika with a constituent last week who was planning a trip with her daughter and new son-in-law to the U.S. Virgin Islands. Shaheen’s constituent didn’t know if they should still be planning to go."Gee, here's a thought -- if people are too stupid to make an obvious decision like this (You don't absolutely need to go there? Stay home, idiot!), maybe this brilliant politician should be discussing with her fellow representatives a directive preventing idiots from needlessly exposing their fellow citizens to this virus when they return, a disease about which the best experts admit they don't know enough as it is. A U.S. possession in the Caribbean is going lose some tourist dollars? Too effing bad! These geniuses whom Americans elect to office will legislate against the health risks posed by second-hand smoke, but they won't prevent their constituents from exposing their neighbors to a virus that causes devastating birth defects? Shaheen told me that the government needs to make sure people have the relevant facts about the virus “without being overly alarmist” so that people can make decisions like these. That's not good enough, stupid.</comment>

<comment>Incapable of nuance so calls people stupid.</comment>

<comment>No, angry that irresponsible elected officials jeopardize their constituents. And terming an irresponsible policy "nuanced" does nothing to make it any less ineffectual. A baby with a birth defect causing an abnormally small head and brain damage doesn't give a damn about your rhetorical parsing.</comment>

<comment>Oh, so you think the conversation told the constitutent to go regardless.  Good old ESPN.</comment>

<comment>You're missing the point. Which is not surprising, given that you posted misinformation in another of your posts in this thread, apparently not having read the New York Times article linked above. Another ready, fire, aim poster. The point you're missing is that people shouldn't just be told why their traveling to an infected area is a risk. They should be told not  to go -- i.e., be prevented from going -- if they're traveling to an infected area needlessly (e.g., on a vacation trip). Perhaps you don't remember how people who'd traveled to Ebola hot zones where quarantined when they entered the USA recently. That's what the more-responsible Senator Schumer is talking about.I won't even bother to ask for an explanation of your bizarre reference to ESPN. Have a nice day.</comment>

<comment>The WHO and CDC aren't advocating travel bans.  Kthanks</comment>

<comment>They should be advocating travel restrictions. Hopefully, the "global, coordinated response" they're calling for will include them.</comment>

<comment>The won't.  The Director-General has been clear on that and the rationale behind that.  But hey, I'm sure you know better than some of the world's most preeminent epidimiologists.</comment>

<comment>That's "epidemiologists." They're concerned about affecting economies and the flow of needed materials to affected areas. Additionally, they don't want to discourage volunteerism to affected areas by medical personnel. But it seems common sense to limit public exposure as much as possible in our own country, and it wouldn't be an excessive demand to require a sufficient justification to travel to an affected area. I wouldn't count the desire to take selfies on the beach a sufficient justification.This is only the fourth time the WHO has declared a "public health emergency," their highest level of alert and the same level applied to the Ebola outbreak. In that instance, returning travelers from hot zones were quarantined in this country, and rightly so. As Sen. Schumer said:“We all remember when people reacted too late to Ebola. ...They caught up with it finally, and it didn’t spread. But we don’t even want to have to go through that with Zika. We want to stop it before it gets here.”But I'm sure you know better than Sen. Chuck Schumer who sits on Health Care, Border Security, and Homeland Security subcommittees.This is getting to be a waste of my time, talking to you. Like I said before: Have a nice day.</comment>

<comment>Schumer also isn't calling for a travel ban in his three point plan which is consistent with what I've been stating nor is there a travel ban on the table regarding Zika .   Unfortunately since you agree Schumer knows best you must agree that there is no need for a travel ban  but I'm sure you know better than Sen. Chuck Schumer who sits on Health Care, Border Security, and Homeland Security subcommittees.</comment>

<comment>With the Ebola outbreak, travel restrictions were, in fact, imposed. So if Mr. Schumer is serious about mounting an effective response to this epidemic, he'd better not let businessmen whining about lost profits have the last word. Don't kid yourself: if they're dragging their feet here, it's primarily about money. This country shouldn't respond with less common sense than the government of Nigeria:Dr. Chan, however, advised pregnant women to consider delaying travel to Zika virus-affected areas as well as protect themselves with safe mosquito repellant or long clothing.The WHO’s position came a day after the Nigerian government advised a travel restriction of its pregnant citizens to Latin America, the worst hit region since the Zika virus outbreak began late last year.Isaac Adewole, Nigeria’s Health Minister, ‎said the restriction would remain in place until “the situation improves.”This disease is spreading like wildfire:According to updates published on the WHO website, Brazil reported its first case of Zika virus disease in May 2015.“Since then, the disease has spread within Brazil and to 22 other countries and territories in the region,” the world health body said.</comment>

<comment>Travel restrictions are different than a travel ban.   There never was a travel ban in the US during Ebola.Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at Nottingham University, said: “A kneejerk response would be to ban travel and trade with countries affected, but the truth is that the potential problem is much wider. It wouldn’t really be feasible to lock down the affected countries to try to stop the spread of a virus that is carried by the Aedes mosquito, especially when affected and unaffected countries border one another.“Until populations can build up sufficient immunity, either through natural infection or through vaccination, then the risk to pregnant women is real and therefore this group need to take extra care to avoid becoming exposed.”Prof David Heymann, chair of the emergency committee, stressed that the most serious issue was not the Zika virus itself, which causes a mild illness, but the microcephaly cases in babies. “Zika alone would never be a public health emergency of international concern,” he said. “It is not a clinically serious infection.” For that reason, he said, it was a very difficult decision.http://www.theguardian.com/wor...</comment>

<comment>You introduced the terminology "travel ban," with the implication of a wholesale ban on travel to and from a region. That's a straw man of your creation, but keep knocking it down if it makes you happy.This is what I said:"The point you're missing is that people shouldn't just be told why their traveling to an infected area is a risk. They should be told not to go -- i.e., be prevented from going -- if they're traveling to an infected area needlessly (e.g., on a vacation trip). "But it seems common sense to limit public exposure as much as possible in our own country, and it wouldn't be an excessive demand to require a sufficient justification to travel to an affected area. I wouldn't count the desire to take selfies on the beach a sufficient justification."That's a travel restriction. That's what the Nigerians have imposed, preventing pregnant Nigerians from traveling to affected areas.As for Mr. Heymann's bizarre observation, seemingly intended to minimize the gravity of the threat posed by this virus -- no kidding; we know  that microcephaly is the most serious issue. Is it not serious enough? If you think not, look at some of the photos of the affected babies. Nothing these professors  have to say militates against the common-sense conclusion that pregnant women should not be going needlessly to regions where they might become infected, as the Nigerians have wisely concluded. Additionally, no one should be going to these regions for mere vacation trips. This, again, is common sense. An intelligent, responsible person doesn't maximize the chances of transmission of this disease by infected persons returning from hot zones by placing no restrictions on travel.Sen. Schumer can't have it both ways: if there's to be some effort to lessen the spread of the disease, it can't be business as usual. The Canadians are already preparing restrictions on blood donation from travelers to the affected regions. Meanwhile, an American woman as far away as Hawaii has given birth to a baby deformed by this disease. But let's follow the path of least resistance until it's a full-blown epidemic in the US too.</comment>

<comment>P.S.This is what was done during the Ebola outbreak:On Tuesday, the White House responded by tightening the restrictions it had put in place, announcing it would funnel travelers from those nations to five airports in the United States where nearly all of them already arrive.There are no direct flights from the three West Africa nations into the U.S., and screening for fever and other passenger checks began last week at the five international airports: John F. Kennedy in New York, Newark Liberty in New Jersey, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson in Atlanta. - the LA Times</comment>

<comment>Aaaaah...phooey! I shouldn't post on an empty stomach. I apologize for my excessively strident initial post where I called people idiots. It just struck me as a ridiculous lack of perspective that this person even had to question whether it was worth forgoing the fun of a vacation to minimize the risk of carrying back to the mainland a contagious disease that's caused an epidemic of birth defects in Brazil.</comment>

<comment>I've been reading about Zika from as many reputable sources as possible in an attempt to fully understand it's Transmission and from what I've read it's only Contagious through Mosquito Bites. So that's obviously where we need to focus our efforts in an attempt to prevent it's spread. I have My College Degrees in Biology and have always been interested in Epidemiology of worrisome Diseases. I think the Public should be clearly told that Zika is Transmitted through Mosquito Bites only and not through Contact with Infected Individuals. This may be an obvious Fact for some, but by not mentioning ways it's not Transmitted along with ways it is Transmitted there's going to be a lot more Unwarranted Fear along the Population due to a lack of clarity on the Important Facts relating to Zika. I've both witnessed first-hand with H1N1 and learned about in College Courses on Epidemiology the Fear and Harm that is brought about by the Public when we're not Informed of both the Facts of an Outbreak as well as the Misinformation, Pseudoscience, and Falsehoods relating to any given Outbreak because a lack of Knowledge can be just as Destructive, if not more so, than a Disease itself.</comment>

<comment>For the Record, I'm unaware if Zika can be Transmitted through Human to Human Contact in certain ways that are incredibly unlikely to occur, such as the way AIDS is spread through Blood to Blood and Sexual Contact, which is infinitely different than giving someone a Hug and getting Infected with AIDS. I've scoured every source possible and none mentioned Human to Human Transmission.</comment>

<comment>It's been reported consistently as a mosquito borne illness.</comment>

<comment>You didn't bother to read the New York Times piece linked to this Atlantic article, apparently.</comment>

<comment>The one where the second paragraph states it is a mosquito borne illness?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the one that says: "Although the virus is normally spread by mosquitoes, there has been one report of possible spread through blood transfusion and one of possible spread through sex. The virus was found on one occasion in semen."</comment>

<comment>Like its cousin dengue.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, any soothing guidance the White House or public-health officials give is tempered by a significant caveat: We just don’t know enough about Zika to quell many Americans’ concerns. And public-health officials outside the United States, particularly the WHO, are sounding a much louder alarm. The WHO on Monday declared the Zika virus a “public health emergency of international concern” that needs a global, coordinated response.When you're dealing with a disease that can cause devastating birth defects, you err on the side of caution if you're intelligent and responsible.</comment>

<comment>"The committee found no public health justification for restrictions on travel or trade to prevent the spread of Zika virus," WHO Director-General Dr. Margaret Chan said in a press conference after a Monday meeting of the organization's emergency committee to discuss the virus."http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>Btw, I had immediately changed the use of its.  It doesn't correct the disqus notification though.</comment>

<comment>Why is fear unwarranted? The disease is transmitted by two particular species of mosquitoes, one of which inhabits 30 states and ranges as far north as New York and Chicago, rather large population centers. And perhaps you should've followed the link to the New York Times article that's posted in the above article. You'd have learned: "Although the virus is normally spread by mosquitoes, there has been one report of possible spread through blood transfusion and one of possible spread through sex. The virus was found on one occasion in semen."And I'd love to learn how fear of a disease can in any sense be more significant and more devastating that having a child born with an abnormally small head and a damaged brain.</comment>

<comment>A little more practice with capitalization would make it easier to follow your thoughts.</comment>

<comment>As if we don't already panic pregnant women enough as it is.</comment>

<comment>How do we do that?</comment>

<comment>The article states "Many people who contract the virus don’t have symptoms, and even if they do, those symptoms are easily weathered."Absent whole scale screening for exposure to Zika, that makes it incredibly easy for travelers to carry Zika to other locations. If the conditions are optimal for mosquitoes, as they are in many areas on the Gulf coast, Zika will be transmitted. Because this is an emerging disease, scientists simply don't know the % of infected pregnant women whose babies will suffer from microcephaly or the incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome.Health officials had to deal with a similar situation with rubella virus. It's a generally mild, highly communicable virus that causes serious birth defects. Because of the MMR vaccine the public has forgotten rubella and it's toll on infants. What is the acceptable risk for a fast-spreading mosquito borne disease that, by all the evidence available, can cause terrible damage to fetuses in utero?  The only harm from an overabundance of caution at this point will be economic. The costs involved in caring for a 'cluster' of microcephalic infants in some poverty-ravaged area of the Gulf coast would be astronomical. It's ironic to me that the Atlantic, which is always concerned about racial injustice, downplays the risks that Zika virus poses to poor women of color in the USA."...A discarded tire by the side of the road here, an undrained culvert there — it doesn’t take much for water to pool into little havens where disease-carrying mosquitoes can breed and prosper. The problem is especially acute among poor communities in the American South, where in recent years, poverty and climate have combined to subject residents to a rash of tropical diseases — Chagas disease, dengue fever, chikungunya — that have left other parts of the United States relatively unscathed.......But if outbreaks of the disease do occur in the U.S., sections of the impoverished South are most likely to be slammed, a region that public health officials and medical experts describe as woefully underprepared to combat it." http://www.ibtimes.com/us-prob...</comment>

<comment>A CDC expert on NPR last evening said it only takes a teaspoon of water for mosquito larvae to develop.I agree with your point about this affecting more poor women of color and the "downplaying" of it in this article.</comment>

<comment>This is another cover-up."Of the previously touted 4,180 cases of microcephaly in Brazil, the actual number of confirmed cases so far is, well, only 270.  Bang.  But wait, there’s more.  AP: ‘Brazilian officials said the babies with the defect [microcephaly] and their mothers are being tested to see if they had been infected. Six of the 270 confirmed microcephaly cases were found to have the [Zika] virus.’  Bang, bang, bang.  Out of all the microcephaly cases re-examined in Brazil, only six have the Zika virus.  That constitutes zero proof that Zika has anything to do with microcephaly.”https://jonrappoport.wordpress...</comment>

<comment>Rappoport backs up what he says, you have only opinion and smear."For science bloggers who live in mommy’s basement and love the statements of the experts, try this.

<comment>Busted: 25,000 cases of microcephaly in the US per year"Microcephaly: babies born with smaller heads and brain impairment.  Heard of it?  Of course you have.  Towering experts are saying it’s caused by the Zika virus in Brazil.They don’t know how.  They don’t know why.  But they’re saying it over and over like trained parrots."They’re saying that, somehow, this virus, which for at least 60 years was causing only mild illness, is now at the heart of all these new cases of microcephaly."Really?  Then why are there 25,000 cases of microcephaly in the US every year?"https://jonrappoport.wordpress...</comment>

<comment>Oh, gee...breaking news just reported by Reuters:The first known case of Zika virus transmission in the United States was reported in Texas on Tuesday by local health officials, who said it likely was contracted through sex and not a mosquito bite, a day after the World Health Organization declared an international public health emergency.Some of you might want to change your stories now.</comment>
