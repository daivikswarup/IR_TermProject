<comment>I love that Affirmative Action is about to get tossed just as the campus protesters are forcing weak kneed college administrators to promise to get more minority students on campus.</comment>

<comment>You "love" this? You mean you're happy that at the exact moment that it may be shot down by the Supreme Court as the law of the land, it's going to continue via political activism?Or did you mean something else?</comment>

<comment>It hilarious. How are they going to increase minority enrollment without considering race?</comment>

<comment>They'll aim for economic diversity. This will help working class whites advance too. Which we need. Wasted human capital is wasted, regardless of any race considerations.</comment>

<comment>That's the one.</comment>

<comment>And what argument is made for that benefitting the University of Texas? By the logic of the justices outlined above, considering socioeconomic background does not advance the cause of providing the best possible education</comment>

<comment>Socio-economic considerations, like the top 10% plan, side steps this entire issue. The only reason to consider race under this line of argumentation (EPC) is for it to benefit everybody's education. But if you aren't considering race, you don't have to deal with that test.</comment>

<comment>Not all top ten percent grads are equal. Put a kid from Highland Park ISD against a kid from Hico and there's a huge difference. And yet in spite of academic deficiencies and lack of AP programs in smaller districts those graduates are seen as equal by UT admissions.</comment>

<comment>and that is totally legal. It is worth noting that HP ISD kids have a serious coke problem.</comment>

<comment>And Southlake and Flower Mound have heroin problems that get swept under the rug.</comment>

<comment>That was the whole point, it allows students from crappy neighborhoods with lousy schools a chance at the big time.</comment>

<comment>And while they were top ten percent in a non-rigorous, non-AP heavy school other students working hard in AP level work are simply passed over? And that's fair to you?</comment>

<comment>simple, there is no right to not be discriminated against based on socioeconomic considerations.</comment>

<comment>BINGO !!!</comment>

<comment>That's a much more valid and less racist approach.</comment>

<comment>You beat me to this reply.Actually, I would welcome this change. I really don't see race-based admission as anything but racial inequality. Now, targeting economic diversity, on the other hand, is much fairer - and incidentally achieves the similar results for minorities.</comment>

<comment>Economic need = what Affirmative Action ought have been from the beginning under Kennedy in 1961.</comment>

<comment>If working class whites are treated fairly, there will be virtually no minorities in colleges other than Asians and Jews.</comment>

<comment>True, especially considering that in trollistan working class whites are a minority</comment>

<comment>Everyone is a minority if you have enough boxes and sort meticulously enough.. Example: White male/female transsexulal who wants to change their sex and become a homosexual lesbian - but who also watches Spongebob SquarePants 4 hours a day? CHECK!!!!</comment>

<comment>I teach in a school with a large number of Asian students. Those students work like crazy because they know the deck is already stacked against them.</comment>

<comment>I have seen this for years, it is really sad.  Asians are wonderful people and deserve better. It is racism plain and simple, and it is wrong.</comment>

<comment>Without considering race, the group of students from disadvantaged economic backgrounds would again be overwhelmingly white and truly overwhelmingly Asian. The percentage of students who are either black or non-white hispanics would be nominal at best.This isn't anecdotal. Academic metrics like GPA and standardized test scores favor whites and Asians when controlled for income. In fact, the SAT publishes it's own mean scores list controlled for both race and income. Unbelievably, blacks from the highest income level considered (family income over $200K) score LESS than both whites and Asians from the lowest income level (less than $20K).If socioeconomic diversity worked to provide racial "equity", then schools would have implemented that. But schools have studied this problem and have concluded what I'm offering now. If you pay attention to actual court arguments rather than emotional appeals by columnists or even internet commentators, Affirmative Action defenses don't bring up socioeconomic parity. They simply argue on behalf of diversity for diversity's sake. Their argument essentially is that diversity (spuriously, I think) has been proven to be a boon to problem-solving in academics and business.</comment>

<comment>Well stated.  I agree that the evidence of diversity per se being beneficial to problem solving is very scant. Most of what I've experienced is that diversity slows and complicates the process of working together to solve problems without improving the end result in any measurable way.</comment>

<comment>Its funny you mention that. I'm in construction and we always notice one black guy on a crew is great, everyone gets along and work gets done. 2 or more however, and it suddenly becomes a posse thing and there is this us vs them vibe.. Just an observation from the real world.. I know, ill be called racist soon..</comment>

<comment>There isn't anything wrong with that.</comment>

<comment>I guess a good case could be made for having all the stakeholders at the table, since the graduates of these institutions will go on towards leadership positions in business and government.  It seems almost like taxation without representation, some people are expected to be good consumers and taxpayers but they don't get a seat at the table where all the adult decisions are made.</comment>

<comment>I'll admit that it's an interesting way to look at it, but what is representative? Is it representative that someone with your skin color sits on a board somewhere and, therefore, you can expect that your particular life experiences and values have a seat at the table? I think most would say "no", but I'm speaking a bit generally here. If we speak particulars and with relevance to the topic at hand, elite schools draw from a very narrow segment of blacks and Hispanics to fill AA slots.Most Hispanic AA picks go to white Hispanics who essentially are indifferent in appearance to most American whites (Giselle Bundchen fits the US census definition - and thus college admissions definition - of a Hispanic person). Is that truly representative of the under-served population of Hispanics? Most black AA slots at elite schools are filled by the children of professional (medicine, business, engineering) and at least middle-class African and Caribbean immigrants. When I say most here, I mean over 50% at schools like Harvard and Yale. To put that in perspective, only 5% of black Americans are either immigrants or the children of immigrants. Is that representative of poor blacks with family ancestry that includes American slavery and Jim Crow? The remainder AA slots for blacks at these schools further overwhelmingly go to the children of black Americans who earn at least middle-class family incomes and, in most cases, better. If the aim is to uplift the acknowledged problem of generational black poverty, is that representative? And, then, self-reporting lets biracial students and those with a single black grandparent claim themselves as black. As a result, black demographics at elite schools skews in favor of "mixed" blacks by many multiples over their actual presence in the general population. And, of course, none of this is representative simply because all of it falls under the single category "Black".</comment>

<comment>Jesse V. - there is much iron in your words.  elite universities and colleges, both public and private are perpetuating a huge fraud when they tout the number of "black" students enrolled.  often a majority of the "black" students fall into one of three categories: actually from Africa or the Caribbean; first or second generation immigrants from Africa or the Caribbean; or mixed race (Obama was a twofer for Columbia and Harvard Law admissions offices: his dad was African and he is biracial).  these affirmative action/diversity admissions programs do nothing to "uplift" the black race.  originally, these programs were designed to recruit and  enroll talented black students who otherwise would not apply because they came from a culture where college is not valued and there was no one to guide them in the application process.  the students were supposed to be native born blacks whose roots trace to slaves brought to the Continental US.  (all four grandparents born on continental U.S. soil).  if anyone doubts this "fraud", they can google a New York Times article from 2004 focusing on Harvard's admissions policies.  schools will stick a "black" face on the brochure and brag about their commitment to diversity.</comment>

<comment>I won't argue the veracity of the statistics you quote concerning African and Caribbean immigrants filling most AA slots at prestige universities.  The million dollar questions is, why?  Why is it that American blacks who are the descendants of slavery and Jim Crow can't achieve at the same level that African and Caribbean immigrants do? Did 500 years of slavery change their genetics?  It seems kind of far fetched, but I am also sure that the slave owners were not breeding for poets and scientists.The same can be said of the Spanish caste system imposed on Mesoamericans.  They were getting by pretty good on their own before the Spanish showed up, building pyramids and paved roads and stuff.  They had their ups and downs just like everybody else of course, wars, corruption, all the regular crap that goes along with large scale human organizing.  The point I am trying to make is; I really don't believe their lack of representation at prestige universities has anything to do with a lack of inherent, native intelligence or ability.  If they are on the sh*t end of some kind of systemic, cultural bias that causes intergenerational, centuries long chain of misery and poverty, then I find that unacceptable.Anyway, I see your point about the dangers of  racial categorizations.  For a hilarious treatment please check out Kevin D. Williamsons article http://www.nationalreview.com/....</comment>

<comment>working class whites??? You mean the people being replaced by mexicans?</comment>

<comment>That's how it should happen.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. Society has been wasting human capital since the beginning of time.. The problem seems to be some in society want to play "god" and decide this particular human capital and not some other human capital should be held up like a man on crutches, or pushed down in favor of their "pick"....</comment>

<comment>The 10% rule appears to do a pretty good job of it.  Race is never explicitly considered there.  They just take the top 10% from every school - even failing urban ones where half the class drops out.  In theory that would give you a group with the same racial makeup as the overall population.  Its not a good idea for many reasons but it would increase minority enrollment.</comment>

<comment>Hope you don't get one of those 10 per centers from Camden operating on your brain.</comment>

<comment>Camden?  We're talking about Texas - not New Jersey.  And in any case before one of those kids operates on anybody's brain they need to get into medical school and a neurosurgical residency.  Both are pretty selective so I wouldn't worry about it.With that said though I'm totally against the 10% rule and have been since it was first enacted almost 20 years ago.  I'm just pointing out that it is a way to increase or maintain minority enrollment without explicitly targeting minorities or using racial quotas or preferences.</comment>

<comment>I like the 10% rule.  It does eliminate the potential for disparate conditions to prevent someone from attending a quality college.</comment>

<comment>It also makes it very difficult for someone from a good high school to get into the state university.  And the difference is pretty vast.  I mean there are high schools where 80% of the class is well prepared for university because that's the path that's been pushed on them since they were born.  And there are schools where half the class doesn't even graduate.  The 10% from the former is going to be far academically superior to the 10% from the latter.  What sense does it make to send all those people to the same university?  I mean in this country roughly half of all college freshmen drop out.  The latter group will be much more represented amongst the dropouts.  College isn't some lifetime achievement award.  Ultimately the people that get in have to do the work.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that's necessarily true.  It sounds logical, but those who over-achieve in a poor school are also those with the drive to overcome obstacles, while those who just kind of trudge along in a better school might not be.Ben Carson came out of a poor school, for instance.  Due to several factors- and especially his mother- he overcame that handicap to become perhaps the foremost pediatric neurosurgeon in the world.</comment>

<comment>Those who overachieve in a poor school aren't going to have a problem getting into the flagship university under any system.  10% of the class in a poor school are not overachieving.  I know people that teach in poor schools.  Half the class doesn't graduate.  Of the ones that do attendance is a huge issue for many.  Maybe 20% of the class are college ready by some definition of the term.  So you're letting half the college ready kids into the flagship whereas on the other side of town you had some crazy competition to get into that 10%.I'm about letting people of equivalent capability to achieve in college into the top colleges because ultimately these kids are all going to be in the same class doing the same work ideally at a similar level of quality.  Just taking 10% from every high school isn't going to achieve that.  If they need a specific percentage then maybe they should adjust the percentage based on the school's average test scores or something.  Go with a minimum of 3% and a maximum of 25% or something.</comment>

<comment>Again, I don't think your observations are accurate, or, better, not representative of the whole.Your argument is akin to the critics of the Titans and Ravens when they drafted Steve McNair and Joe Flacco:  critics who believed a fairly effective quarterback from a major Division I school would perform better in the NFL than one who excelled at a mid-major.  In both cases, those critics were proved wrong.</comment>

<comment>Camden, Texas? Apparently it's near Moscow.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I looked it up the other day.  Pretty small town.  Probably not what he was talking about.</comment>

<comment>Oh c'mon, brain surgery is way overrated. I could knock one out after a five martini lunch.</comment>

<comment>Hey a**hole,  where did Ben Carson come? I dissected a brain like yours in high school. It too belonged to a pig.</comment>

<comment>test scores???LOL</comment>

<comment>Just take the most gifted, hardworking, and deserving, the Asian students will do just fine, last time I checked they are a minority too.</comment>

<comment>Wrong minority though. There are preferred minorities.</comment>

<comment>BY TAKING BACK OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS & FORCING STUDENTS TO BEHAVE OR FACE THE CONSEQUENCES !!!</comment>

<comment>Your caps lock is stuck.  It seems to have glitched your connection to reality, too.</comment>

<comment>MY CAPS LOCK IS WORKING BEAUTIFULLY ! UNLIKE YOUR OBAMA CARE ADHD DOPE !!  THE SUBJECT IS WHY MINORITIES CAN'T COMPETE ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD !! BUT YOU CAN GO ARGUE LETTER CASE USAGE AT YOUR LOCAL KINDERGARTEN CLASS !!  YOUR CONNECTION TO REALITY !!</comment>

<comment>Ah, I see.  PEBKAC.</comment>

<comment>GALLP</comment>

<comment>NO !! WE LOVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD !!! THAT'S WHAT WE MEAN !!</comment>

<comment>The campus protesters demand to get more minority students is already illegal.  Using race in admissions to get a racial quota was ruled illegal in 1978 - Regents of the University of California v Blakke.</comment>

<comment>Only in theory.  Bakke was a terribly reasoned decision and so was Grutter v. Bollinger in which Sandra Day invented out of thin air the fiction that promoting diversity is a compelling state interest.  Quotas are still used but just under the diversity subterfuge.  Its a disgusting practice that can never ever be justified.</comment>

<comment>Supreme court activists are idiots.</comment>

<comment>"...invented out of thin air the fiction that promoting diversity is a compelling state interest."I disagree.  Day was probably made aware that the Soviets were actively exploiting divisions -- racial and otherwise -- in the U.S. for propaganda and other purposes.  This could been one of many things that collectively led to the downfall of the U.S., if it had not otherwise been addressed in some fashion -- the promotion of diversity being one.Ironically, rather than a drag or a negative on the US, "promotion of diversity" may have been an unheralded positive -- an effective "defense system" against the aggressive, divisive, political designs of a foreign power.  I mean, we did win the Cold War...</comment>

<comment>Pumping up the number of minorities in the colleges has led to the kind of things we are seeing on the campuses today.  Anti-free speech rallies at many universities is sickening, but is actually one of many unintended consequences of artificially pumping diversity into the universities.  The elite universities are supposed to be for the "best and the brightest" of our young, because of this push for diversity this is no longer true.I am a person that says racial discrimination of any sort is wrong.  So, giving someone a leg up specifically because of their race is wrong because it discriminates against those that are not of that same race.</comment>

<comment>When I was at University back in the early 90s, I was not enthused about the concept of AA.  But, I also never noticed these kinds of protests.  Why now, I wonder?   Multiple choice:A.  Anxiety that President Obama has just one more year in office. B.  An organized propaganda-ploy to stir up left-wing oriented news during the presidential campaign cycle -- the leaders of BLM are paid-under-the-table and the rest are just sucker black-groupies.C. The fact that a lot of the black kids at university these days grew up without fathers in the house and are thus undisciplined and prone to whining (something fathers would never stand for)?  D.  All of the aboveI am going with "B," but frankly "D" is probably the more complete answer.</comment>

<comment>It is such poetic justice.</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action does far more harm than good - it's a cosmetic attempt to make student bodies more closely reflect the national population, but because it turns a blind eye to the fact that the makeup of the top students in the country doesn't actually look like the country's overall racial composition we end up with too many under qualified minority students at top end schools that struggle to graduate on time and end up gravitating towards the easiest majors.  The real issue is that as groups, white and Asian students far outperform everyone else and all of the things that are tried in k-12 to try and change that do not appear to make any difference.  Thus we end up with "diversity" as the magic sauce that makes it acceptable to overlook this disparity.The idea that the only way black and latino students are going to get ahead in life is by ensuring they are a larger presence at elite institutions is total bull - going to an average or somewhat better school and graduating on time with less debt is far better for the overwhelming majority of students of any race and is no barrier to a successful career.</comment>

<comment>No study supports your contentions, but facts are probably irrelevant to your opinion.</comment>

<comment>You mean other than the racial gaps in every standardized test required for admission to higher ed that have been present for decades (or check out elementary and secondary education scores as well)?  ACT, SAT, LSAT, GRE and so on?  They aren't small differences, either.Sorry that the scores of millions of test takers doesn't validate your worldview.</comment>

<comment>You said that affirmative action does more harm than good. No facts support that statement. All studies indicate that minorities benefit from affirmative action, though some Asian minorities do not because they lose college admissions to whites and blacks.</comment>

<comment>The studies I've seen show that as far as admissions are concerned, it's a draw for the white population.  The net effect is a tradeoff of Asians for African-Americans... so I guess you could say that the net effect for minorities is a draw as well.In any case, whether you agree with Scalia or not, I think he makes a valid point.  We're not doing good for anyone if we admit them, but they can't graduate.  We're merely saddling them with debt.  The idea of objective admission standards has real value if those standards correlate with chance of successful matriculation... which SAT and ACT scores seem to do.</comment>

<comment>please stop your concern trollingWhen you stop committing the egocentric fallacy.  But seriously, did you just do a Google search and paste the first link you saw?I wasn't actually addressing mismatch theory.  If someone can make it at State, they can make it in the Ivy league.  Students are not actually going to be harmed by attending a more selective college because selective colleges aren't really much more difficult.  The Ivy League doesn't really have much of an issue with graduation rates in any ethnicity; they can take all the 3-sigma outliers.The problem is in the lower tier private and public colleges (not to mention the two year and for-profit schools) when the Ivies have skimmed off the best candidates.That being said, this is all probably a tempest in a teacup:http://www.motherjones.com/kev...The barriers to some minorities in attaining a college degree seem to be in place well before they even apply, and not well ameliorated by a focus on admissions.  Discrepancies in admission rates also seem to be much less significant than discrepancies in graduation rates.</comment>

<comment>Forget mismatch theory.  There is no justification whatsoever for taking race into account for competitive admissions.  Achieving Equality through discrimination is a delusional liberal fallacy!</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You are rude and stupid.  Nice work.</comment>

<comment>Achieving equality is a delusional idea.</comment>

<comment>Do you find it odd that not a single study has actually refuted the mismatch theory (which is actually based on real data).  Instead the cries against the theory use appeals to morality to try to offset actual data.The UC schools saw the benefits of removing affirmative action in 1996.  While enrollment for minorities went down for Cal and Berkley, the overall minority graduation rates in the UC system went much higher.So no, it doesn't have limited credibility.  You have no data to counter it.  You are a sad person.</comment>

<comment>Please stop trying to sidle up to a table that: 1) you are not qualified to sit at by your own individual merit and 2) can only sit at through artificial fixes that are unfair to all but the recipients of these fixes.</comment>

<comment>Has there been an increase in percentage of black college student dropouts after the installment of affirmative action into university admissions procedures? This would help validate your point. </comment>

<comment>I don't think the data is good enough to show an increase, but it is good enough to show that the discrepancy in graduation rates is an ongoing problem, and probably a bigger problem than the discrepancy in admission rates.Five-Thirty-Eight has a nice discussion here:http://fivethirtyeight.com/fea...</comment>

<comment>Well then damn, there's a lot to learn from this. The obvious one is that, while affirmative action is well-intentioned, there is something happening earlier on in education or child/adolescent development that needs to be addressed. It would be interesting to take the data sets used and see if there was an increase in low-income students attending, and if there was a change in drop-out rates amongst them.</comment>

<comment>You think a liberal I.V. league prof is gonna flunk his only black student?  Wow, delusion squared.</comment>

<comment>if he doesn't when he has legitimate reason to; then the system is totally broken and all degrees from all colleges are denigrated by such a stance.. We already have social promotions and hollow high school diplomas from the K-12  educational establishment ...... Oh, wait!! Many colleges that are issuing degrees already have this hollow, worthless; and "it's only a piece of paper" degree problem..</comment>

<comment>most stuff they teach at college is never used on most jobs.</comment>

<comment>Really? Is that all higher education is to you? A jobs preparation program? Do you have such little intellectual curiosity? That's so sad...</comment>

<comment>Ok  I am a FAA licensed  Aircraft Mechanic,why did I obtain certificates in project management, six sigma,lean six sigma from Villanova,   two composites engineering certificates from Oregon Tech, Supply Change Management from Michigan State and is on schedule to graduate from Wisconsin next year in aviation management . Some who has such little intellectual curiosity would not do that. I  grew up on welfare in inner city Baltimore,how the F did I do all that if we are all so effing stupid????</comment>

<comment>Maybe you're an outlier.. Tell us what happened to all your childhood and high school buddies from your welfare laden inner-city Baltimore ...(I had a black friend in the Army, another senior sergeant; who told me what happened to his buddies from welfare laden inner-city Philly over a fifth of Crown Royal once..)..BTW: I've never found the educator yet who has said; these are exactly the facts and skills you need, and ALL you need; to succeed in life. BTW: congrats on your achievements; but as a collective - I don't think you're effing stupid; I think you're effing lazy......</comment>

<comment>Is that what you extrapolated from my question? If I were to ask what color the Sun is, would you interpret that as me denying Hillary's role in Benghazi? Or do you randomly choose which questions to offer off-topic replies to?</comment>

<comment>"Has there been an increase in percentage of black college student dropouts after the installment of affirmative action into university admissions procedures?"  If liberal professors don't flunk black students why on earth would data related to this be of any relevance? You are an idiot.</comment>

<comment>You'll have to prove that professors are purposefully not flunking out their "only" black student, because apparently now affirmative action, according to you, has more to do with which students pass the class than it does college admissions. Pro tip: use your brain, and stay on topic, before ironically calling other people idiots. My original question, which was perfectly reasonable I might add, had nothing to do with black students passing their classes. </comment>

<comment>You have a problem with reading comprehension.  Probably why you did so poorly on standardized tests.</comment>

<comment>Lol ok. Thanks for the presumptuous insight. </comment>

<comment>No, this kid is just some BLM supporter, another socialist, welfare parasite.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you're right.  Those other guys I mentioned are a little brighter.</comment>

<comment>Yes, affirmative action programs are not the only things that decrease Asian enrollment at Ivy League universities.As far as graduation rates go, Vox has a point:  African American students don't do worse at less elite schools; in fact they generally do better than African Americans at less elite schools.Probably some of this does go back to admissions[1].  On the mean, African American students rank lower in predictors of college success - GPA and standardized test scores - than members of other ethnic groups, however, in a large country, there is still a substantial population of African-American students that scores highly on these metrics.  The Ivies and more elite schools draw heavily from this population, and these students do well.  So in a very important sense, Scalia's concern is completely backwards.However, once this population representing students from a few standard deviations above the mean is taken by the elite colleges, less elite schools end up drawing from applicants with lower scores and, the discrepancy in average GPA and admissions testing scores between African Americans and other ethic groups starts to show itself in discrepant graduation rates at less elite colleges.There is a problem.  It's just in the less selective institutions.http://fivethirtyeight.com/fea...[1]  But not all of it by any means.  African Americans are also more likely to be enrolled in collage part time, for example, which is bad for graduation rates.</comment>

<comment>Legacy parents pay for the AA minorities to attend.  Duh!Blacks are not flunked by liberal professors. Duh!</comment>

<comment>Asians sued the University of California successfully for denying them admission when less qualified whites were admitted.</comment>

<comment>You have a good point. But don't I think we face a binary choice between relying on academic credentials and using race. I am in academia and have seen students with good potential from poor backgrounds do well in college, even if they did not have as good credentials coming in.The real problem we face is that college admissions officers do not appear to be really trying to identify these people with great potential. They are just filling up implicit racial quotas without any concern about the potential of these students.Universities will be well served if they tried to identify students from disadvantaged backgrounds who could use the college experience to make up for deficiencies in their high school environment, irrespective of their race. So, I would not advocate going solely by academic credentials, nor would I support affirmative action.</comment>

<comment>Students who are accepted based on race are more likely to drop out. That was the finding at the University of Michigan.</comment>

<comment>And the ones who did not drop out, were they better off?</comment>

<comment>Read "Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study" by Thomas Sowell.  Your statement is false; there are plenty of facts that support his statement.</comment>

<comment>You cite Thomas Sowell like he's some dispassionate academic on this subject.</comment>

<comment>Since academia tilts so heavily to the left, I find it difficult to believe in the myth of the "dispassionate academic."</comment>

<comment>Like "Paved with Good Intentions," it makes conclusions that are not based on the facts it presents. Junk science.</comment>

<comment>Asians rarely if ever lose out to whites, only to other minorities, except at law schools, where they discriminate against whites in favor of Asians.</comment>

<comment>"More harm than good" good and "minorities benefit" are two separate concepts. America doesn't exist to "to benefit minorities" but to serve society as a whole. Preferential treatment of minorities (black and Latinos) at the expense of others (whites and Asians) is unfair to the others, who are much larger in numbers. You define "benefiting minorities" as "good" only because of your pro-minority belief system, not because it's "good" in a society-wide sense. Democracy can protect minorities, but it should not ELEVATE them above others.</comment>

<comment>It's indeed remarkable how easily she assumes we all exist for her benefit.</comment>

<comment>so what you're saying is that blacks who are "affirmatively admitted" with lower test scores and drop out of college are better off than if they had attended a lower tier college where they could better "compete" and may have graduated.</comment>

<comment>Many of them attend other institutions and are quite successful. Some people learn from their mistakes and get second chances. It happens with many white legacy admissions.</comment>

<comment>agreed~!</comment>

<comment>Actually an entire book supports this contention - "Mismatch".</comment>

<comment>Junk "science."</comment>

<comment>And yet your side has never once presented actual data to dispute it.  Not once.</comment>

<comment>Join your ilk in the climate change deniers. There are hundreds of articles on the positive effects of affirmative action.</comment>

<comment>deflection</comment>

<comment>Look at Obama's law career.  It was a joke.</comment>

<comment>He was selected as an editor of the Harvard Law Review at the end of his first yearThat is a singular accomplishment. He was the first black law student to be so honored.</comment>

<comment>And because of Affirmative Action (generally) and the desperation of places like the Harvard Law Review to swell its "diversity" ranks, the world will never know if President Obama received that honor because he was exemplary and well deserving or simply because he was black.  How sad is that?  Especially for him, if he was in fact exemplary.  So yeah, let's keep the policies under which the accomplishments of only whites (and sometimes Asians) can be objectively attributed to personal achievement.</comment>

<comment>It is not sad. It is a signature accomplishment despite your jealousy.</comment>

<comment>He was elected editor simply for being black.  There are plenty of well written .articles on the internet describing this travesty and his pitiful law career.  Don't be as lazy as Obama, look them up and read them.  You might actually learn something about Obama and the society.in which you live.</comment>

<comment>If blackness was the lone criterion for selection as law review editor, why was he the first? You are jealous!!!</comment>

<comment>Yes, Obama is so proud of his academic accomplishments that he had his records hidden from view.</comment>

<comment>As a lawyer, it's an "honor" but in name only. You only have to be in the top 50% to be on law review and the editor is just an election.Do you know what law review students do? They, and I'm not kidding about this, do cite checks on other people's articles. The students do not write articles themselves (well, they can, but that's not their main function. Anyone can write a law review article). What's a cite check, you ask?This:  ABC v. DEF, 123 U.S. 456 (2015). Is that the correct citation to the case or were numbers transposed, a later decision made, etc....It's literally something you learn in first year classes. Law review is the biggest waste of time in law school.</comment>

<comment>Yes.... The top 50% make the bottom 50% possible...</comment>

<comment>No, you have that backwards. The bottom 50% make the top 50% possible.All law school classes (generally above 30 students) are curved. The more dumb people there are, the easier it is to get higher grades. Most law schools set the curve at a B, or even a B+. That means 50% will get above or below a B or B+. When you take a normal distribution, if you have an exceptional number of dumb students, getting the A or A+ becomes that much easier as you only have to be slightly better to make large jumps on the grading scale.As a relatively smart law student, I loved when professors made difficult tests because I knew that my score would be much higher than if it was an easy test. If I got one more right answer on a hard test, that might raise my grade 5 or 10 points. Whereas, on an easy test, it might not even raise my grade a single point.</comment>

<comment>I had no idea grade inflation at the university level was so hopelessly entrenched; I have suspected it for quite a while but not in graduate, medical or law school...</comment>

<comment>Oh yes, it's quite bad. At Harvard Law (and many other "elite" law schools), they've completely done away with GPA. They use a Fail/Pass/Honors system where the percentages of students receiving those are 5/90/5. So, basically, everyone gets "pass."In medical school, that's pretty much the norm. In my wife's school (and it's common among others), there was fail/pass/high pass/honors. Someone akin to 1.0/2.0/3.0/4.0. The problem was, getting an Honors could be next to impossible because doctors (who were part-time professors) weren't mandated to give honors, so they'd give a high pass which would tank a GPA (well, not "tank", but for my wife who graduated #3 and was AOA [med school honors society], it affected her GPA a lot when a doctor would pull that).</comment>

<comment>You seem quite jealous of law review editors. Didn't get chosen yourself?</comment>

<comment>Didn't apply. It was hard to fit in as a judicial intern for 1.5 years. I got a lot more experience drafting federal district court orders (over 100 published, never reversed), than some law review person ever did cite checking.In fact, I'm sure my published articles have been cite checked by law review workers. So, no, not jealous, just rightly putting them in their place.</comment>

<comment>And yet not a single article by him has been found and few people seemed to even know who the guy was during the period he supposedly attended Harvard..</comment>

<comment>Well, he did no go into the law profession. You will need to find another (false) reason to hate him.</comment>

<comment>No worries... I have lots of reasons and I voted for the SOB twice. "Hope and change" my ass, and  I'm so picked on because of my color..</comment>

<comment>There have been studies that showed adverse effects of affirmative action on blacks; many students who went to good colleges and dropped out would have succeeded in lower ranked universities (based on success of students with similar credentials at the lower ranked universities).It is really supporters of affirmative action who ignore facts. In fact, they ignore people too. Their goal is to promote their ideology even at the cost of the harming the lives of poor minorities who end up paying for a few years of college and then dropping out or studying some useless major.</comment>

<comment>Cracker.</comment>

<comment>Umm... what?  The ONLY study on benefits/negatives of race based admissions over merit based admissions show higher drop out rates for minorities.http://www.theatlantic.com/nat...http://articles.latimes.com/20...So I have to ask again... what?</comment>

<comment>Drop out rates are not a negative for those who succeed. You listen to too much Limbaugh.</comment>

<comment>Your "caring" isn't relevant,  My comments are directed at and helpful for the rest of us who are studying you :-)</comment>

<comment>There are, in fact, studies that say that parental education level and family income have a bigger influence on K-12 academic achievement than race. If we extrapolate that, it indicates that raising the college graduation rates of black and Latino students will eventually help to increase the K-12 academic achievement of their children.</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action doesn't raise college graduation rates. It actually decreases them because they can't keep up. This was the finding at the University of Michigan. Lower rates of graduation for students accepted based on race.</comment>

<comment>Oh please, I grew up in the inner city on welfare .I scored a 850  on the SAT.  I have taken classes at Villanova ,Michigan state, Oregon Tech and maintained  a B average. I will be graduating from the Univ. of Wisconsin next year. I guess what? I saw whites drop out of classes also. It sounds like you want to play the old game of block the blacks out of the big name schools, then use that against them later in life at hiring or promotion time.</comment>

<comment>truth</comment>

<comment>bull schidt.</comment>

<comment>With your poor writing skills I am surprised you graduated from high school.  But this is today, and there are no longer any standards.</comment>

<comment>When it is time to submit my class papers, I make sure they are written properly.  I cobbled that one up!!! good catch! . Too many black folks graduate from college for you racist whites to keep that KKK bullshit going</comment>

<comment>When you grow up, you should get a job with the Black Panthers as their press agent.  They thrive on spewing unintelligent gibberish to Liberal nitwits.</comment>

<comment>shit you write very well, as well as a cockroach</comment>

<comment>You went to a Tech school but don't understand statistics?</comment>

<comment>I took applied composites and materials and processes there to obtain certificates in composite engineering thru my job. I scored A and B grades in those six classes.I have not taken stats yet, but I will score an A in aviation law this semester. F that you are black you cannot do the work BS. Plus I am a FAA licensed aircraft mechanic who trouble shot airplanes at the gate for two major airlines... this coming out of the ghetto of Baltimore.</comment>

<comment>Could it be that you; through poorer test scores, poorer grades and poorer overall preparedness; block yourselves? I wonder what would happen if remedial classes were no longer offered at the college level?</comment>

<comment>a whole lots of white kids would fail also.</comment>

<comment>Yes they would; because they are not prepared for the shock of hard work. Many college freshman are not prepared for the intellectual rigor required to do well, where for most - it's "rout hog or die".... I blame K-12 educators for the problem...</comment>

<comment>white folks would be fucked also</comment>

<comment>That's fine with me. No slack due to anyone; regardless of race, sex, or any other attribute. Either you're prepared or you aren't prepared. "Today, nearly 60% of first-year college students discover that, despite being fully eligible to attend college, they are not ready for postsecondary studies. After enrolling, these students learn that they must take remedial courses in English or mathematics." When I went to school top drawer students finished in three years; with the norm four years.... Now kids are hanging around in undergraduate studies for 5-6 years. That's pretty pathetic if you ask me..</comment>

<comment>And AA started in the 1970s. The grandchildren of the original beneficiaries should now be at an age to apply to collegeIf your theory had validity we should already see the effect in the qualifications of POC applicants</comment>

<comment>LMFAO!!!</comment>

<comment>You might like to read "Mismatch" by Sanders & Taylor</comment>

<comment>Use racial preferences to admit less qualified applicants into tougher schools.  Then they can't compete in legit majors and get pushed into fake ones ending in "Studies".Half resent that they're unemployable and not taken seriously, half eat up the entitled victim garbage.  So you get tantrums at Mizzou, Yale, etc, and the white guilt crowd thinks appeasement will fix it.Can we try ending discrimination by not having state institutions discriminate now?</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.</comment>

<comment>The truth hurts.  If we want a society that does not discriminate based on race, then we need to stop discriminating based on race.  It's sad that you can't see that.</comment>

<comment>This is not discrimination. Being white is not considered a demerit, which was stated in the article. And if you think otherwise, then perhaps I ought to offer you a bandaid to put on your feeble little bleeding heart. </comment>

<comment>Claiming that a disadvantage in admission is not considered a demerit is mental gymnastics on the "there was no Holocaust, and the Jews totally deserved it" level.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, have fun playing semantics.  Race being plus for one group is functionally equivalent to getting a demerit for whiteness.  If you support affirmative action in any way, then you support racial discrimination.  It's pretty simple.</comment>

<comment>"Playing semantics" I take it you don't know what 'semantics' means.</comment>

<comment>If others get points for not-being white than being white is a demerit. If I give all neighbors of Mill (except Mill him/herself) a tax break based on not being Mill, isn't being Mill a demerit?</comment>

<comment>No. Mill is not being punished for being Mill. Others are being rewarded for being not-Mill. There's a distinction. </comment>

<comment>If people get bonus points for not being white, that's discrimination against white people.</comment>

<comment>No, that's discrimination in favor of black people. If you truly believe that this is discrimination against white people, then perhaps you'd can point to evidence to suggest that this is harming them.</comment>

<comment>In other words: You need a "fix" put in for you in the form of affirmative action because you can't do it all by yourselves.. Is that the gist of your argument?</comment>

<comment>For me? I'm sorry, are you implying that affirmative action directly benefits me?</comment>

<comment>I don't know if you do or not; although you are defending this inherently unfair practice. There may be no "demerits" for being white... But then, there are no demerits for a white foot racer who is running a race with a black or a white playing golf with a black either.. That is; until said black gets to start the race 100 yards ahead of the white or get 6 strokes subtracted from his  card.. That's called a handicap in a race or golf and is a "fix" to supposedly "level the playing field" As in: Can't run as fast or can't play golf as well.......</comment>

<comment>So then why did you directly imply that when you didn't know in the first place? </comment>

<comment>So then, tell us if you did benefit from affirmative action. And if not; why is such a big deal to you? Why do you think it "justice" to fix" life for some individuals (and not others) by governmental fiat?</comment>

<comment>good luck getting some whites to do that</comment>

<comment>The vast majority of whites don't discriminate at all.  Blacks especially have been conditioned to incessantly play the victim and not take responsibility for themselves and their own communities.  They play the blame game and wonder why nothing gets better for them.</comment>

<comment>Blacks just want a level playing field. Look at the military officers, that is a level playing field with some of the smartest folks of all races in that group. Plenty of blacks excel in that environment because it is a level playing field.</comment>

<comment>For the most part, there is a level playing field in almost all areas.  Equality of opportunity does not ensure equality of result.  Blacks have been conditioned to feel entitled to things that they don't have to earn.</comment>

<comment>no we learn not to trust you bastards early in life</comment>

<comment>You learn to blame others for your own shortcomings and your own cultural problems. </comment>

<comment>that is bull S black folks just want a fair shot. We would not even have AA if whites were not hosing the the black folks to death in this country and still do.</comment>

<comment>So no redress for slavery? No redress for police and fire departments who denied employment to blacks? No redress for women and minorities who were denied admission to schools?</comment>

<comment>In addition to trillions in welfare, we now hire black women to be firefighters. Look how well it works out: http://nypost.com/2015/11/22/s...</comment>

<comment>Most welfare payments go to white people, not minorities.</comment>

<comment>Is anyone dumb enough to fall for this line? Adjust for population percentage </comment>

<comment>Adjusting for population percentage is one purpose of affirmative action. Glad to have your support on board.</comment>

<comment>You're conflating two different issues. Affirmative action admits unqualified minorities to represent them in the same proportion as their percentage in the population.If we adjusted welfare benefits the same way blacks would get less, as they currently collect more proportionally.Of course you're a deceitful liberal fūck.</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action admits many qualified minorities. Tests are not the only indicator of ability to succeed. Drive and hard work will win every time.</comment>

<comment>No redress for people whose ancestors gave the Neanderthals a little 'nudge.'No redress for people whose ancestors were preyed upon by Vikings?No.  No redress for any legacy issues.  If someone discriminates against YOU PERSONALLY, go for it.  But there is no collective guilt for the sins of the ancestors.</comment>

<comment>I guess you are pining for the good old days of Viking raids. Most of us have advance past that.</comment>

<comment>And what in my example gave your feeble mind THAT idea?What I said was that none of us are responsible for the sins or crimes of our ancestors.  There is no legacy guilt.  Or should I hold contemporary Japanese responsible for the war crimes committed by their ancestors for the war crimes they committed in China in the 1930s?   Or today's German kids for the atrocities committed by the SS?You demonstrate your intellectual bankruptcy by your posting.</comment>

<comment>Check the Bible. We are responsible for correcting the sins and crimes of our ancestors.</comment>

<comment>Oh. You are a religious fanatic?  I understand your support for ISIS now. I'm a secular humanist. Get bent. </comment>

<comment>Ah. You are a religious zealot. Like ISIS. That explains it. </comment>

<comment>There are a lot of secular reasons for society to atone for past mistakes. No biblical reference is necessary for the ethics of doing it. It is simply the right thing to do.</comment>

<comment>Ah.  Backtracking, or as they say in Cajun country, crafishin'. By what authority, other than your religious one,  do you claim 'it is simply the right thing todo'?  By any Darwinian interpretation, survival of the organism justifies itself.  Or are you one of those Creationists?  </comment>

<comment>What has Darwin got to do with it? That is natural selection. We are talking about what civilized governments and society do, or should do. Some of us are generous enough to want to share the benefits of society rather than keep them all for ourselves.</comment>

<comment>So what?  How am I stopping you from sharing anything you own?  But you don't own the constitution.  That's a contract with us all.Share all you want of YOUR RESOURCES.  It is not "generous" of you to "share" other people's resources in violation of that contract, it's theft.  </comment>

<comment>We are in the lifeboat together, so everyone is better off with cooperation and sharing. That was the great insight of Jesus of Nazareth -- it is better to cooperate than compete. We can all be better off with cooperation. That often is not the case with competition. You do not get roads to drive on without cooperating with everyone else. That applies to many aspects of the common good.</comment>

<comment>So that is YOUR culture?  Well my culture says differently. Surely you agree with multiculturalism?  And you have no more right to compel me to follow your culture than I have a right to compel you to follow mine.   </comment>

<comment>EXCELLENT. So why don't you cooperate with me, and do it MY WAY.Is the defect in your argument sufficiently clear, or must I be less subtle?</comment>

<comment>Yet what if my definition of "the common good" differs from yours?  What if my cultural norms are different from yours?  Should I be allowed to compel you to do it MY way?  If not, why should you be allowed to compel me to do it YOUR way?</comment>

<comment>And again, do you believe your culture is superior to mine?  And if so, why?</comment>

<comment>I like my culture; I don't know if it is superior. It has created a society that I would prefer to live in compared to North Korea, Syria, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and a host of others. I don't know if that is what you mean by superior, though.</comment>

<comment>And I like my culture, but not yours. So it would seem we are at an impasse.  </comment>

<comment>And yet you went right for the biblical reference, as if it made a difference.  By Darwinian criteria, simply surviving justifies itself.  Are you one of those Creationist types, by any chance.  Don't you believe in science?Now, failing at that, you give your unsupported opinion. Why should I - or anyone else - assume your opinion is better than mine?  Particularly on an ethical issue, something that is always culturally dependent.  Or do you believe YOUR culture is somehow superior to that of everyone else?Like, you know, ISIS does.</comment>

<comment>You have been reading Ayn Rand, I see. Good for you. Just don't believe that it works. A drunk with a .38 can undo John Galt at any time.</comment>

<comment>Wrong again. I loved sci-fi as a kid, Clark, Asimov, heck, I read Asimov when he was still Paul French, but I never got past the first half chapter of Rand.You don 't get much of anything right, do you?</comment>

<comment>And what if I am genetically incapable of sharing your values?https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Whine, whine, whine.  You're just proving my point.  You don't correct past discrimination by discriminating in the present and future.  Stop complaining and take advantage of the level playing field and the preferences that you clearly have now.  Or you can keep complaining instead of putting in the hard work, because crying about things that happened 40 years ago has worked SO WELL for blacks so far.</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action has worked very well for many blacks. You DO correct for past discrimination by preference today. There is no other way unless you are an advocate for reparations. You cannot cheat for decades then simply declare that there will be a level playing field from now on. That is as dishonest as Tom Brady (who seems to have done exactly that).</comment>

<comment>No, it has actually hurt blacks and other minorities  And yes, regardless of what happened in the past, the ONLY way to move forward is to have a level-playing field now and to stop discriminating.  Neither you nor anyone else, regardless of their race, is entitled to anything.  If, as a culture, you would accept this, the black community would be far better off.  As it stands, you have essentially accepted your role as a permanent underclass by continuing to support policies like affirmative action that harm you.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that was the finding at the University of Michigan. Lower graduation rates among students admitted based on race.</comment>

<comment>Those students may not have benefited even as thousands of others did.</comment>

<comment>BS.  So true.  Why do you think African Studies was invented?</comment>

<comment>There is merit to this argument. But what particularly bothers me is that usually the people who make this argument are also the group that wants to gut the budgets of state university and educational assistance programs. Many are acting in bad faith and in a way that discredits their own position.</comment>

<comment>Given all the lazy rivers going into college campuses, maybe they don't need as much money as we're told they do.</comment>

<comment>State universities are getting more money than ever while charging students more and paying professors less. They are basically corporations who spend all their money on absurd living amenities and bloated administrative departments and bureaucracy. Everything but the learning.</comment>

<comment>You do know that the tantrum at Yale was by a white girl, right? The one on video, at least. </comment>

<comment>Paleface liberals always excelled at competitive anti-racism.</comment>

<comment>Actually, she's not...but she did sit on the board that hired the prof she yelled at.http://dailycaller.com/2015/11...</comment>

<comment>"Competitive anti-racism" I bet you felt really sophisticated when you came up with that phrase.</comment>

<comment>I felt like pointing out the obvious.If that's too high-brow for you, then the malfunction is not on my end of the line.</comment>

<comment>http://www.theatlantic.com/nat...http://www.academia.edu/465024...There is hard evidence that this game of pretend in fact hurts the people they are supposed to help.Double standards at admission virtually ensure that they are invariably relegated to the bottom of every class in competition, which disincentivizes learning.</comment>

<comment>What a crock, plenty of white folks in those majors too.I work in aerospace every engineering group is 40-50% other folks than white people.</comment>

<comment>Asians and Indians right?  And about 1% AAers?</comment>

<comment>There are a fair amount of Blacks ,Arabs and Hispanics in those groups.  I Have not seen one lily white engineering group yet at my job. there are smart people in every group. Also white folks created this mess by hosing the blacks for 150 years after slavery until 1965. Think how much better off the blacks would be if whites did not practice Jim Crow and the black codes for 150 years.a</comment>

<comment>I couldn't care less what members of group A did to members of group B a century before I was born.I don't want freebies because I can trace some ancestral link to the latter group, nor should I be punished for kinda-sorta looking like some of the former group.Do you really want to ride a racial gravy train forever?  Or earn your way in the world?  You can't have lower standards and also be taken seriously.</comment>

<comment>The military is a level playing field, how come blacks rise to the highest ranks? to make General you are going against some of the brightest people in America. Are you trying to say they just give those stars away?. You  and ton of other white folks do not know any black folks so you believe all that bull S. You are no giving us anything but bull S.</comment>

<comment>Those groups have Arabs Latinos and blacks in them also, but not one is 100% white. Trust me the white engineers make errors just like everybody else. i see the results on the shop floor every day.</comment>

<comment>"Then they can't compete in legit majors and get pushed into fake ones ending in "Studies"."Oh the rights' favorite hobby horse.  Yeah, learning about people and culture is a waste of time.  *rolls eyes*</comment>

<comment>It's not just the right, there are plenty of liberals who find it stupid as well.</comment>

<comment>Maybe so, but I am not one of them</comment>

<comment>Learning about all people and cultures (anthropology) is legit. Studying nothing but one's own self for four years (black studies, women's studies) under the tutelage of a far-left guru is an exercise in narcissistic navel gazing.</comment>

<comment>You have the right to do with your life as you will. If ____ Studies scratches that itch, then go for it. But if you're doing it at Yale or Dartmouth, then you're spending the same $75k a year that another student is also spending towards a degree in biochemistry, computer science or medicine. If you're accruing an irresponsible debt for _____ Studies while you have access to these other fields, then shame on you.I think the ballooning cost of college requires a serious reassessment of the courses of studies offered and their expected payouts and payback rates. We're headed towards an era in which _____ Studies programs can expect to be pruned almost everywhere save a few select schools where said programs will actually be competitive and the lower number of graduates in these fields will actually be employable at wages commensurate with their training.</comment>

<comment>Reassessment of cost, but NOT because of coursework offered.Also, student loan debt incurred while studying Physics vs _______ studies can be just as problematic. One's undergrad major does not necessarily determine payback ability; rather, the student's long term career trajectory and his/her own future financial decisions.Yes, some science majors are unemployed and playing video games in the basement, while Gender Studies majors are collecting big paychecks at media, marketing and higher-ed jobs.</comment>

<comment>"Use racial preferences to admit less qualified applicants into tougher schools"You just described the plaintiff in this case.</comment>

<comment>The Plantiff can't prove if it was race that knocked her out of a spot, or social economics, grades, essay, extra ciriculum activities, family background. All factors in the admission process when you don't qualify for admission because you didn't finish in the top 10% of your High School class. Not only that but something like 168 Black and Latino kids who had better grades and higher test scores than this white girl didn't get into the University of Texas.... Of the 47 Students she claims got into the school that had worse grades and lower test scores 42 of them were WHITE.... Only 5 Black and Latino students got in that had worse scores and grades than she did..... Based on this case we have to listen to a racist white judge say Blacks can't cut it at schools like University of Texas and should go to lesser schools REALLY!!!!</comment>

<comment>Article: " Scalia now thinks minorities would be happier with their own schools."That is not what he said -- see the actual quote in the second paragraph. He expressed a legitimate concern that students admitted under AA (the 10/7% rule) was not a good thing if they didn't have the preparation to succeed. Whether or not Scalia is sincere in this concern, it is a sincere concern of many, including leaders in racial minority communities. Students who succeed at a second-ranked college are more likely to do more for their community than those fail at a top-ranked college.Setting up minority students to fail at top-ranked colleges so that those colleges can trumpet their racial diversity is exploitation of those students.----AA is in trouble because of 50 years of Liberal racism on this issue -- it presumes that all minorities are poor and educationally disadvantage and that most Whites come from highly privileged backgrounds (the impossible condition of both being a majority and members of the upper 1%).When I was in college, the average social-economic-status of the Black students in my dorm was higher than the Whites. Those Blacks included children of college professors, lawyers, doctors, owners of chains of stores... The notion that a Black student who went to an exclusive prep school provides "diversity" while the White from a working  class family in a dying industrial city doesn't demonstrates contempt for the actual meaning of diversity.Consider how Asians are treated as a group under AA: People of Hmong ancestry (post-Vietnam War immigrants from Laos) are much more likely to be poor and disadvantaged educationally than those of Japanese or Chinese ancestry. But Liberal racism insists on clumping them all together and thus the Hmong are treated as  part of a privileged, over-represented group.If AA falls, Liberals have only themselves to blame for having sabotaged it over and over again.And the malicious misrepresentation of what Scalia said by the reporter is but one example of why debate on AA is pointless. Aside: I never thought I would never find myself defending Scalia.</comment>

He'll get kicked soon enough.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they should have a more concrete poll question than: "Do you favor or oppose affirmative action programs designed to help blacks, women and other minorities get better jobs and education?"Maybe they should ask the Asian parents: "Do you favor or oppose affirmative action programs that promote/enable Black and Hispanic students to be accepted to a university at the expense (in terms of an acceptance spot) of Asian and White students from the same socioeconomic background and with higher test scores and more extracurricular activities?"Of course people support programs that are "designed to help" people.  Without listing the tradeoffs associated with these programs, this question is not giving the surveyors/researchers the answer that they think it is.</comment>

<comment>How about merit based?  What a thought!!</comment>

<comment>The same Asians who loudly protested California even considering resurrecting Affirmative Action, are actually for the policy?http://www.scpr.org/blogs/mult...</comment>

<comment>Class-based AA is also unworkable Constitutionally: wealth (or lack thereof) is not a protected class, and *shockingly enough,* no elite/selective school wants even a plurality of lower-class students.  They cost more money in financial aid (or make for bad headlines after they graduate with $150k in private student loans) and perhaps more importantly, don't have that great network of professional and personal contacts for other students to benefit from.  Ergo, selective colleges "want" to discriminate against lower-income students, and they can all the live long day.  Take a look at the Pell Grant participation rate for any highly selective college: outside of UC-Berkeley, it will be under 20%, and often under 10%.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Well, Republicans, the financial industry, and let's face it, probably all Democrats, too.</comment>

<comment>no elite/selective school wants even a plurality of lower-class students. Probably true, but while elite schools get disproportionate focus, AA programs are and have been common at state schools as well where elite networking is far less important and education of the masses is actually a historical part of the mission.  The University of Michigan's (in)famous point-based system strongly favored individuals from the upper peninsula for class reasons, and this was not regarded as unworkable.</comment>

<comment>Heh.  Michigan has a 32% acceptance rate and is one of the most elite public universities in the country.  In fact, only 20th-ranked UC-Berkeley, 23rd-ranked UCLA, and 26th-ranked Virginia are above 29th-ranked Michigan.  Not the best example to use, then.</comment>

<comment>You were the one asserting that class-based admission standards were unworkable at elite universities.  The more elite Michigan seems, the weaker your argument becomes.I see your point; I just don't think it applies to the vast majority of schools.</comment>

<comment>Actually, high performing minority and lower income students actually have higher rates of success at more selective schools. They would do even better to apply to highly selective liberal arts and research schools, since smaller schools offer more  support in many cases.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps, but we may be seeing a phenomenon here whereby the most elite schools can be the most selective of their students.</comment>

<comment>Gasp!  A liberal rag deliberately misrepresenting what a conservative said?!  How could this happen?  Has it ever happened before?  Open a full investigation!</comment>

<comment>i would concur that the kid with the 1400 SAT is not necessarily as intelligent as some heavily disadvantaged kid with a 1200.  But in terms of who is most capable of succeeding in college that's clearly the kid with the 1400 SAT.  Acceptance to college isn't supposed to be some lifetime achievement award.  Ultimately everybody there is going to have to complete the same assignments - ideally at a similar level of quality.  Someone accepted based on how prepared they could have been in some alternate universe where they go to a better high school and get a 1400 is going to be at a disadvantage and not perform as well.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it probably is doomed. Clarence Thomas, whose entire career is a testament to affirmative action, will vote to kill it. Sad.</comment>

But because he's a conservative, it's okay to dislike him.  Let me be clear, my personal view would be that OrangePolicy simply doesn't like Clarence Thomas' opinions.  But if the roles were reversed, liberals would never give a conservative the same consideration.  E.g. - every criticism of President Obama is claimed to be rooted in racism.</comment>

<comment>He should vote to kill it as further proof we have overcome that nonsense.</comment>

<comment>We shall overcome, but a new twist?</comment>

<comment>Ditto for Ginsberg.  She's stuck in the 1960s</comment>

<comment>Yes and all white peoples should vote together too. I have hope white liberals will wipe away their white tears and come round.</comment>

<comment>Be kind. I wish Scalia no ill.GOP racism is not nearly as prominent as the racism of some of the loudest voices in their midst would suggest. Those voices are few, but need to be rejected, of course. However, the party as a whole is not capable of enforcing discipline in this regard. Or in any other regard. A free wheeling organization is a vibrant one, to a degree, but there are limits. There will be no incentive to arrive at this conclusion until they start losing votes.</comment>

<comment>The problem is I'm a liberal with conservative values. Or vice versa, I'm not sure. I'm just not an individualist, not to the extent that the majority of our culture takes it, Left and Right alike. Racism is fading, it exists to a much lesser degree with each generation, and the older generations have largely come around as well. However, underlying economic distress is bringing our divisions to the fore, and this goes for race, class, geography, and, yes, partisanship. The media is amplifying the effects. And the talking heads are distracting us from the underlying economic problems. This is preventing us from addressing them as we are too busy turning on each other.</comment>

<comment>For right now, all Trump supporters are the enemy.That's exactly what Trump wants.</comment>

<comment>Ah, the Ta-Neshi Coates method!  Good luck with your plan to try and steal from white folks.  Let us know how that works out for you.</comment>

<comment>What did you ever own that we stole?  What part of what I have do you bear any responsibility for the existence of?</comment>

<comment>First, the GOP is not at all conservative. Second, conservatism means the government is conservative in its actions and intrusions into the lives of individuals.</comment>

<comment>White supremacism made Asian-Americans better of than everyone else, hmm?</comment>

<comment>So, the fact that the Democrat party was built on support of slavery, Jim Crow, and segregation (not to mention the welfare state designed to keep minorities permanently dependent on government) would mean, what, exactly?  Because those are, of course, the FACTS.  It was not Republicans who filibustered the Civil Rights Act of 1964 for days.  Please spare us your "everyone who disagrees with me is racist" BS.  And for the record, if you want to hear racial epithets being shouted, the fastest way to find them is not to attend a Tea Party or Trump rally, it is to attend a Black Lives Matter rally, where they are not just occasionally tolerated, but loudly cheered.</comment>

<comment>Nope, she doesn't want to be let in because of her race, she simply doesn't want others being let in preferentially because of THEIR race. Straightforward to any rational mind. As far as "feeding one's ego", affirmative action does it quite well by letting in unqualified dunces and making them feel like Ivy-league material, reality be damned.</comment>

<comment>'Affirmative Action' is, as we all know, is just code for 'It's OK to discriminate against more qualified Asian and White students'.It has no place in society, and is clearly racist.</comment>

<comment>After the world watched Obama and Holder apply their "racism" claims arbitrarily and inconsistently, the whole "racism" excuse has been outed.  And it is deliciously ironic that it took Obama's clumsy moves to fully debunk "racism".  Your "racism" blather is just a worn-out, flimsy excuse for poor performance in many dimensions - work ethic, family, crime, etc.</comment>

<comment>Well in summary, you've repeatedly said that 1). I don't know how to read - which is obviously untrue and 2). That you don't care, which is obviously true.</comment>

<comment>I've been seeing this guy a lot. All he does is troll. He hates anyone who doesn't agree with him and tells them to shut up.</comment>

<comment>I suspect it's yet another incarnation of the Bradan Feasa.</comment>

<comment>If you don't care, why do you keep reading what he writes?</comment>

<comment>They want to control the discussion.</comment>

<comment>'Affirmative Action' is, as we all know, is just code for 'It's OK to discriminate against more qualified Asian and White students'.One little quibble with that. At the time of passing the AA white women were being held out of these schools as well and while we did not benefit as much as others, benefit we did.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it seems, white women have benefitted the most from the early affirmative action measures. http://ideas.time.com/2013/06/...</comment>

<comment>Early on in education and later with employment. I was a beneficiary of AA on the employment side even though I had the highest test scores of the 20 male applicants I still would not have been hired had it not been for AA.</comment>

<comment>Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it wasn't necessary or that those who benefitted from it weren't deserving back in the day. I'm just saying here that white women benefitted the most from it. I'm really just commenting on the second half of your last sentence, "we did not benefit as much as others..."</comment>

<comment>That is probably true in other parts of the country it would not have been true of Texas and Louisiana at the time.</comment>

<comment>Diversity is a strength. But fairness is important. However, fairness is difficult to achieve when school systems are so economically stratified. I think race has become less dividing than socio-economic class in higher education. Texas' Top 10 percent should ensure both economic and racial diversity in the short run. In the long run, colleges need to weigh test scores against economic background to a limited degree. This will be hard but it's vital. How much of affluent students' high test scores can and should be controlled for in order to best tease out the highest potential applicants? </comment>

<comment>I attended very diverse public schools, in a district without much disparity between the highest and lowest-earning households. We all had the same books, teachers, and resources to draw from, yet the black and Latino students, in general, didn't care as much about getting good grades, while the majority of white students and nearly all of the Asian students did. As senior year of high school came to a close, which groups do you think had the near-monopoly on admissions to highly-regarded institutions of higher learning?This is a typical result; within groups of students of similar incomes, going to the same schools, there is a persistent achievement gap between the races. It can't all be explained by class.</comment>
