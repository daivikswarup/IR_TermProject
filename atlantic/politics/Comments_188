<comment>Occupy Wall Street and protests over police shootings were also derided. But at least those movements played in the big leagues. Part of why campus protests aren't taken seriously is that colleges are protected incubators. Students target real and symbolic issues that don't threaten people's lives and livelihoods. As attributed to many people, academic politics are so vicious because the stakes are so low. http://quoteinvestigator.com/2...</comment>

<comment>OWS...I don't recall them accomplishing anything. President Obama appears to have through the Justice Department coordinated a nation wide police crackdown on that movement. One day OWS existed and the next it was all gone. </comment>

<comment>I agree that OWS accomplished nothing tangible. But the movement's primary concern, worsening income inequality, is a real, persistent problem that won't disappear as a cause. Safe space, Halloween costumes and building names, even if marginally legitimate issues, are trivial in comparison.Likewise, the Ferguson protests and its sequels addressed the thorny and consequential history of police behavior toward African-Americans.</comment>

<comment>I agree there are significant issues worthy of protest on campuses. I disagree with you though on income inequality being their prominent issue. If they were focused on that they would be protesting the lack of black students in the stem majors and the dearth of college advisement. There are real things colleges can do to make a more fulfilling and challenging environment. Instead like you said they obsess over trivia.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't it be nice if someone brought up the more thorny issue of how many African-Americans behaved towards law, authority and their embodiment--the police.</comment>

<comment>you know you can't ask that, it would require responsibility, and that is not what we do any longer.</comment>

<comment>OWS knew only the very top level issue of income inequality, they had no real introspection.  OWS simply became the "hip" thing to do.  They accomplished nothing and knew very little about the actual issue of income inequality.Using the term income inequality itself is largely superficial analysis of the issue.  Business do not look at income, they look at cost of labor.  Cost of labor has risen at just over a 3% rate since the 1980s, but none of those gains are going to income.  Cost of labor is seen as income, plus benefits, plus regulatory costs. Democratic demands have continuously increased benefits and regulatory costs, taking away from income.</comment>

<comment>That's pretty impressive because I was living in Canada at the time and they were there as well and then suddenly gone.</comment>

<comment>the money ran out....</comment>

<comment>I don't know if OWS was really so much a protest qua protest, as a social group with free food and social activities for students and recent grads, like the Be-Ins of the '60s. I didn't agree with them but I do feel that a voice like that, hippies and campus rabble-rousers, is needed in society.If anything, attending OWS at the behest of people I had known in college opened my mind to some new ideas. I got to read authors I didn't agree with, like Proudhon, Malatesta and Bakunin. </comment>

<comment>Great. But, OWS never did anything for society. There are from my POV bad things they talked about, but the idea of debating income inequality is a worthy goal. It's too bad they were too dumb and deranged to do it: OccuPirates, putting on shows, giant puppets, etc. not to mention things like Rape Tents, walking in traffic, banging on the windows of a convention center, etc. etc. All incredibly stupid things that had zero impact.At the same time, they were on the same side of the immigration as Big Banks, the Koch bros, and USChamber.I tried many times to get them to use this plan that would have helped them greatly: 24ahead.com/s/question-authori...Instead, they formed a Guitarmy and camped in public parks.</comment>

<comment>>OccuPirates, putting on shows, giant puppets, etc. not to mention things like Rape Tents, walking in traffic, banging on the windows of a convention center, etc>Guitarmy and camped in public parks.those all sound hilarious to me because being all srsbusiness all the time is boring as fuark </comment>

<comment>I agree that a lot of stuff they did was ridiculous, but they helped a lot of people after Hurricane Sandy, with surprising effectiveness and speed. In practical terms, this puts them ahead of many other recent social movements, conservative or liberal, in the "did anything for society" category.</comment>

<comment>Yes, yes, we get it, you should be in charge of center-left and left political groups in the country so that they can use "this plan which would have helped them greatly" or "these questions that would cut to the heart of the matter" or "this list of policy points that would fix the issue in a week"...Or we can err on the proper side of Occam's Razor and assume that you're a fool with delusions of grandeur and that the reason your grand visions are unused in the real world relates more to their and your deficiencies rather than the perceived stupidity of literally everyone else in the United States.The vast majority of the time, the person who thinks everyone else to be an idiot is, in fact, the stupid one.</comment>

<comment>"David" (/loughery111/) appears to be a sockpuppet for "JimJamez" (/jimjamez/), which is probably a sockpuppet being used by a pro-Wall Street libertarian group or fan. It certainly doesn't want Wall Streeters to be asked tough questions. Instead, it wants what happened: OWS had nearly zero impact.For a tangible example, Peter Schiff and John Stossel visited OWS and, like others, shot video that made them look like idiots. If OWS had - in addition to all the other things they were doing - used my plan, they would have shot video showing Schiff's and Stossel's policies wrong.Because OWS did things the way "David" wants, Schiff and Stossel weren't shown wrong.If OWS had *also* done things my way, Schiff and Stossel would have been shown wrong.I'll let the reader decide whose side "David" (/loughery111/) is on.</comment>

<comment>I think Myra Esoteric would beg to differ there.</comment>

<comment>"My plan (which) would have shot video showing Schiff's and Stossel's policies wrong"You just keep putting your arm deeper into the wood chipper, there, sir...</comment>

<comment>I disagree.  I think the whole movement did put income inequality and Wall Street corruption more clearly on everyone's radar.  It's sad that more of those responsible for the economic collapse were not brought up on charges.</comment>

<comment>OWS got nowhere because the liberal powers in charge, had there man in the white house and they didnt want to see any domestic dissent on there watch.NOW, if a republican had been in charge, it would have received massive support of the DNC, the media, and every liberal celebrity and outlet in the country.</comment>

<comment>I'm skeptical, but in any case none of that prevented OWS from primarying even ONE center-right Democratic Senator and  Congresspersion from the left. </comment>

<comment>The weather got too cold.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't the crackdown that killed OWS, but stupid tactical politics.It didn't help that it became a mish-mash of inchoate causes.</comment>

<comment>they accomplished trashing and strangling small businesses owned by people who run them 15 hours a day with an eye to the futures of their families.Because "drum circle"...</comment>

<comment>crackdown? Obama was an OWS supporter from the beginning. It didn't go anywhere because once the tv camera lights were on, we saw who the protesters were -- useless middle and upper class kids and older ex-hippies who had nothing to complain about, but had grown up whining and complaining their entire pitiful lives.</comment>

<comment>That's because OWS was made up of people who didn't keep up with their education or their jobs.  You expect them to follow up with a protest march when the Starbucks ran out and they needed a charge for their smartphones?</comment>

<comment>I had very little against Occupy Wall Street, because it was a new thing - no one had ever protested against Wall Street and corporations.  Protests against the establishment back during the Civil Rights were definitely needed.However, these new protests have no effect on me.  I don't pay any attention to them.  They're redundant, stand for nothing, and are a waste of good manpower.I do pay attention to the fact that a certain percentage of people live a cycle of poverty and crime and cannot get out of it.  People who live in neighborhoods where that poverty and crime is found, either suffer that crime, or are part of the crime.A friend of mine who lived in a horrible neighborhood lived in terror.  To walk in and out of her little house, it was a challenge because her neighborhood was riddled with criminals.  Her little house (left to her by her mom) was broken into many times.  There were gun shots heard at night.  The streetlights were constantly broken.  She had no peace.  Ever.  That's no way to live.  Ordinary people do not want to live in those situations.  I consider those neighborhoods to be a constant assault on the emotions, on the senses, on the future, on life.Why is no one taking care of fixing those, rather than doing protests for nothing?  Or do they not bother with fixing those because THAT is too big a problem, and protesting is easy?</comment>

<comment>"no one had ever protested against Wall Street and corporations."Not sure if sarcasm or ignorance...</comment>

<comment>Had there ever been actual protests outside of Wall Street before Occupy?  I honestly don't know.  I doubt it.</comment>

<comment>Does disappeared after obama got re-elected it was paid for by the democratic party and was dumped when no longer needed unlike the real grass roots tea party which is contributed by real individuals</comment>

<comment>I don't pretend to have personally experienced the issues being protested. As a complete outsider to both the specific institutions and the larger issue, though, my observation is this - protesters have chosen a path littered with demand, ultimatums, and insistence that their feelings are legitimate. They have left little or no room for discussion or compromise, and most who disagree publicly are branded racists, misogynists, and complicit in the alleged crimes being protested. Again, as a complete outsider, creating this dichotomy seems to be neither fair or valuable, and I think it will inhibit whatever progress needs to or should be made.</comment>

<comment>Stop pointing out the obvious response to apologism.</comment>

<comment>I appreciate the middle line you're trying to walk, but to imagine all of these protests are the same and dichotomous is kind of silly.The Mizzou thing could have been solved long before protests even the President had been bothered to care before millions of dollars was on the line.The students are people and essentially customers that have a gripe with the institutions they're paying for. Arguing that their complaints are ridiculous and and should be abandoned only fuels the fire of behavior you deem inappropriate</comment>

<comment>As I noted, I haven't seen any of this personally, and as a Midwesterner I'm from a relatively homogeneous part of the country, so I'm distanced in a lot of ways from this. The demands and events that have made the news have been very "my way or the highway," and that's what I have at this point to make a judgment on. I'm sure there's legitimate cause there. As I noted in my original comment, I think a lot of that cause is being drowned out by anger and noisy censorship.</comment>

<comment>My point is that this is part of a perception that protesters are venomous, but thousands of people marching in anger and disgust is the last resort of a people ignored, demeaned, and unaddressed."They have left little or no room for discussion or compromise, and most who disagree publicly are branded racists, misogynists, and complicit in the alleged crimes being protested."The time for discussion has long been over by the time thousands are marching in the streets to protest racism.My point is that you're attacking people's last resort as if it was a first resort. In order to be heard, minorities need to scream and protest, but at that point white people are too pissed off to listen and demanding we conduct ourselves quietly for a discussion that is easily ignored.</comment>

<comment>No, that doesn't make much sense. The simple act of protesting does not insulate protestors from criticism or make them any less responsible for discussion and compromise. I'm sure I don't have to list for you examples of misguided protests throughout history.</comment>

<comment>You're right, protesting isn't a shield to what some people would deem inappropriate, merely that inappropriate is the only way to be heard.Better to be heard and hated rather than ignored and silent.</comment>

<comment>Wrong again.</comment>

<comment>I disagree. The original Civil Rights Movement led by Dr. King accomplished great things, had people walking hand in hand protesting, but featured none of the ultimatums and screaming. It worked, and many from that era are revered for their demeanor, strength, and great wisdom. Why can't that be the model to emulate?</comment>

<comment>The Civil Rights movement was different because the problems were obvious, no one had to yell that they were being treated as second class citizens, it was obvious, it was the law.Also, the violence was more threatening. If second class citizens had yelled or exercised their rights as anything other than completely peaceful, they'd have been murdered in the streets and lost the support of the North.This is a matter of being heard, people on this message board won't hear them after all the yelling and protesting. This is what it has to be, this is what America is now.</comment>

<comment>Having a speaker with a message you don't like isn't being treated as a second-class citizen.</comment>

<comment>No one said it was, practice your critical reading skills.</comment>

<comment>You need to take your own advice.  Perhaps take off your Team Politics blinders, too.  </comment>

<comment>"[N]o one had to yell that they were being treated as second class citizens, it was obvious, it was the law."That doesn't portend that guest speakers create second class citizenry, merely that in the time referenced second class citizenship was obvious. You insert your belief that I parallel the struggle. If second class citizenship existed here, no yelling would need to occur.Practice your critical reading skills and take off your political blinders.</comment>

<comment>Good lord, are you really that clueless about your own writing?</comment>

<comment>So, when whites protested school integration in places like Missouri and Yonkers, we should have just conceded to their demands?</comment>

<comment>Nope. Protesting against the law is different than protesting against ideas.</comment>

<comment>Please expand on that.</comment>

<comment>Is that even supposed to mean something?  The student protesters are even demanding the end of integration, what with their safe spaces and their need to have only black teachers.</comment>

<comment>You aren't listening.  E.A.'s points are valid and you attempt to justify bad behavior with a strawman argument riddled with other logical fallacies to include overgeneralizations "white people" and false choices "in order to be heard, minorities need to scream"  Really?  Is that all they should do when it is shown it is often counterproductive?).  Your reasoning is unsound.</comment>

<comment>Logical fallacies only exist when you have truths by which to measure them. Your claim of logical fallacies assumes truth in your side." "in order to be heard, minorities need to scream" Really? Is that all they should do when it is shown it is often counterproductive?"That's pretty much true, regardless of whether you agree.When your baseline for what is true is what you assume is true, of course everything looks like a logical fallacy. Your reasoning is unsound because it ignores the facts for your assumptions.</comment>

<comment>"thousands of people marching in anger and disgust is the last resort of a people ignored, demeaned, and unaddressed."It's also the first resort of people with no real grievances but with an overblown sense of entitlement.</comment>

<comment>Crap. They need to be told with great clarity and authority why their protests are garbage. They and you are brainwashed fools.The only ones "fueling the fire" of their behavior are you and the other panderers. </comment>

<comment>I like to believe that people can be against bigotry and racism without brainwashing. Alas in  paranoid right-wing conspiracy land, there are no free men with whom you disagree, only slaves who are too stupid to understand your superior argumentYour arguments are conspiracy theory nonsense, take your tin-foil hat back to your mother's basement.The only brainwashed person here is you, for believing the Fox New conspiracy non-sense about brainwashed black people. Unlike you, I have an argument, all you have is nonsense.</comment>

<comment>The media has brainwashed Americans for generations to believe the following:"Racial diversity is inherently good and to be striven for!"Utter BS. No basis for this belief but white guilt and black angst.I repeat: you are a brainwashed fool.</comment>

<comment>Everyone is brainwashed except for the superior conservative white man because minorities are too stupid to know what's best for them.You racist brainwashing to believe in your own superiority as ubemensch, is hilarious.Why don't you move along to your Klan meeting and talk about  the stupidity of black people and you can all agree they're destroying America with Muslim and Hispanic brainwashed slaves.</comment>

<comment>You're pretty good at putting words into people's mouths, aren't you?</comment>

<comment>The words are coming out of your mouth, I'm only translating the ideas that follow.</comment>

<comment>You are a perfect little leftist soldier, and you play the role of Praetorian Guard quite well, smearing anyone who doesn't fall into line with your leftist viewpoints as a "Nazi" or "Klansman".Let me ask you this:Is it "racist" to observe that blacks are better athletes, at least with respect to certain sports, like basketball, than all other races?Is it "racist" to observe that Asians and Indians outperform whites in academics, in particular in math and science?Is it "racist" to observe that black Americans have more children out of wedlock than do whites?Finally, is stating the truth "racist"?In answering these questions, I ask you to limit your response to what I have, in fact, said and not what you presume I believe. This is called jumping to conclusions, and only brainwashed fools or those with a nefarious agenda do that.TIA</comment>

<comment>"Is it "racist" to observe that blacks are better athletes, at least with respect to certain sports, like basketball, than all other races?"Yep, it fails to understand why blacks achieve athletic prowess and assumes a racial superiority that is not in any way backed up by science or biology.Racism- the belief that all members of each race possess characteristics or abilities specific to that race, especially so as to distinguish it as inferior or superior to another race or races.All of your questions follow that same flawed premise that social outcome is tied to racial considerations. It is racist to observe to observe those things as biological, when it science denies it is biological.Unlike you, I have an education. I know what racism is, I know why it's not true, and I know when people invoke it silently like you do.</comment>

<comment>...and I've just won the debate.You are in denial of reality. I don't entirely hold it against you, as you, like many others, have been brainwashed over the years by the political left. You and the left cannot bear to face the truth: that racism, as defined, IS TRUE.You can rant and rave all you want, but the undeniable truth persists.Now, the mere observation of reality does not (as you obviously believe) entail that some races deserve to be treated unequally. All deserve equal treatment under the law. Your error comes here, as you presume that this means you must deny reality and pretend like there are no differences between the races.I'm glad to have educated you. Hopefully, you will be more open-minded and less arrogant in the future. </comment>

<comment>"Your error comes next, as you presume that this means you must deny reality and pretend like there are no differences between the races."That's not scientifically true in the way insist it is, that's why racists are hated and despised as uneducated simpletons.I can explain every question you asked through social and historical factors in a way that is scientifically consistent. It's funny that you can't even imagine a world in which science takes precedence.You didn't educate me, you'd have to more than make a scientifically false assertion in order to educated me.</comment>

<comment>You are in the first stage of grieving: denial.You can explain nothing other than daydream fairy tale theories about social engineering and the amorphous "society" to which you like to refer.Take a look at the long list of boxing champions, and go back 100 years to the present. Make sure to look at height and reach measurements. You will notice that black boxers always seem to have the longer reach.This is but one example. There really is no point to discuss this any further with you, though, because you behave like a child throwing a tantrum and lash out with name-calling when you hear something you don't like.Good luck to you. </comment>

<comment>In order for me to lose, you'd have to more than make a scientifically false assertion.I don't know what is sadder, your ignorance of science or your pride in your ignorance of science. You're going to need the luck.</comment>

<comment>You are wasting your time. Written is an arrogant, close-minded, ideologically driven brick wall. No penetration possible.</comment>

<comment>I don't need luck I have education. All your anecdotes don't really match up to science, but when did conservatives ever believe science?Treating anecdotes as proof of things that have been proven scientifically untrue, is just crazy and stupid.You can go back to your scientifically unsound arguments and your societal brain-washing conspiracy theories now.Good luck to you, you're the one that's going to need it.</comment>

<comment>"I can explain... through social and historical factors in a way that is scientifically salient."LMAOIf you could, you would, rather than babble about it. </comment>

<comment>I don't have time to write you a library on the social and economic theory of incentives, leisure, and availability of opportunity for black athletes, the historical structures/incentives of various societies, and the connection of geography and resources to human biology and heritable traits.</comment>

<comment>There are a lot of blacks who suck at basketball.  Not all Kenyans can run marathons.</comment>

<comment>I reject the false dichotomy of sameness or hate. There's nothing wrong with difference.</comment>

<comment>So you're rejecting a dichotomy you created? Okay, sure.</comment>

<comment>You're either having a stroke, or your ESP is a figment of your imagination.</comment>

<comment>ROFLOL -- RACIST!You observed it yourself.  Notice that hourglass said NOTHING about the assumption you impute to him.  He merely observed it.  Like you did.</comment>

<comment>Wow, I explained how it was racist and the best you can do is laugh and fail to refute the logic?Sounds about right for you guys.</comment>

<comment>You deny the existence of evolution and process of natural selection. Science. </comment>

<comment>No, I do believe in evolution.I merely don't believe that those processes haven't manifested in huge racial differences as insisted, as can be proven by science. </comment>

<comment>It is Science that leftists do not understand their political opponents, being inferior to it compared to everyone else.Written is providing an example of the bigotry that allows them to maintain their ignorance.  He KNOWS what hourglass REALLY means and "translates" -- that is, puts his own opinion of what he means into hourglass's mouth</comment>

<comment>"It is Science that leftists do not understand their political opponents, being inferior to it compared to everyone else."That sentence makes no sense. I can't believe someone upvoted it.</comment>

<comment>You certainly fail as a translator. </comment>

<comment>For calling me a brick wall, you sure do enjoy trying to one up me. Unfortunately for all of you, your arguments are ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Their gripe was that the college could not prevent someone with no connection to it saying something nasty off campus.The only thing that could prevent that would be institutionalizing the students.</comment>

<comment>So long as this society qualifies the merit of your cause by how offended you are offense will be found everywhere, and black leaders on campus will say things like "little has changed since 1968".</comment>

<comment>I absolutely agree. Feelings do not legitimize action in and of themselves. Evidence, research, and verifiable truth should be the basis of policy. It may make good press, but "feeling oppressed" and suffering "microaggressions" certainly reeks of a manufactured controversy at times, especially over some of the painfully minor things that are raised. Thicker skin and some objectivity would help the situation significantly.</comment>

<comment>Look to the radical feminist movement and specifically the New York radicals to find the answer to legitimizing "feelings".  The expression the "personal is political" is at the root and came about as a result of consciousness raising meetings by groups of feminists. In essence if one "feels" oppressed then it is in fact oppression. It is the subject's "lived experience" not empirical evidence that is key.  The mentality has flourished as feminists have become more prominent in academia through gender studies programs. Apparently the message has now been taken up full force by students.</comment>

<comment>Heckler's veto, old concept, apparently they don't teach it in school anymore.</comment>

<comment>First sensible comment here. </comment>

<comment>This is a rather tame and timid reply.This article is garbage. The BLM movement is garbage. Black Americans and their enablers increasingly seek more and more attentuated forms of racism each passing year, and it has reached a point of absurdity."Access cannot temper exclusion if its legacy is not addressed."Well that just says it all, doesn't it? Equal rights are now expressly acknowledged by blacks, but it's not sufficient. Now they have to go back in time and erase any offensive figures from history they might find.This is childish and pathetic, and white guilt liberals are most despicable of all for their meek insipidity.Blacks are unhappy with themselves. The answers they seek lie there and nowhere else.</comment>

<comment>I disagree with BLM on many issues too. I think some of the tactics they choose are extremely ill-conceived, ineffective, and polarizing. However, I think that I might show people that better with a temperate, reasoned response than calling them "garbage." One might spark conversation, whereas the other almost certainly won't. At the core I think many of your assertions are spot on. I just choose to address them differently in an effort to reach - and hopefully challenge/affect - more people.</comment>

<comment>As you admit in one of your prior posts, you do not live with this or where it is. I do. BLM is crap, and they need to be forcefully told so or otherwise completely ignored. </comment>

<comment>As far as I can tell, BLM has very little to do with black communities. It's mostly a campus thing for a mixed race group of privileged kids, which exploits the issue of police brutality in black ghettos as ammunition for campus politics.</comment>

<comment>Many of their demands are that others must be prohibited from speaking.  Even in this article there's the complaint that someone with views she didn't like was allowed to express them.</comment>

<comment>These activists have way too much time on their hands. How are their grades; what's their major; do they need a part-time job or community service perhaps. Way too much narcissistic motive will only get worse. Employers do not want that!</comment>

<comment>"How's their grades"?  Hopefully the papers they are writing do not contain such an abhorrent abomination of English grammar.</comment>

<comment>Explain?</comment>

<comment>Correct grammar would be "How are" not "How is"</comment>

<comment>Come on - lame,  it's a casual comment board ya know. It's not even a glaring error.  </comment>

<comment>It was really quite the small grammar mistake, I was hoping you would find my overreaction humorous.  I knew that "how's" is the contraction for "How is".  Since you referred to a plural "their", you should have used "how are".  I actually researched to see if there is a contraction for "how are".  The experts seem to be split, but for those who feel it is appropriate, the contraction is "how're".  The problem is, you can't say the contraction without saying "how are" so there is no sense in using it.  I have no life....</comment>

<comment>Ok funny. I changed it to "How are". I sometimes post my main comments in the morning, if I read something that inspires me to post. I'm usually trying to do it quickly. When you brought it up, I wasn't even sure you were telling me I had a grammar error. I caught it when I went back. English Major? </comment>

<comment>It's not about saying shut up. It's about not being babies all the time. Abuse? Ha</comment>

<comment>If they are willing to take the risk of no one wanting to alienate the customers, they are free.  They probably shouldn't go into debt then, though.</comment>

<comment>Why would any sane small business employer knowingly hire a college graduate with a history of agitation and demand-making, and/or with some sort of Oppression Studies major?Our small company has a high percentage of minority employees and managers. We demand initiative not docility; but we will also do everything we can to avoid hiring sensitive, self-obsessed Snowflakes, or leftist troublemakers. If one therefore wants to go work elsewhere, that's fine with us, but those who fit in and work hard do well indeed, regardless of skin color or background.</comment>

<comment>"Progress against racial injustice is stagnant, yet the demands of student activists are still widely dismissed."Well, Nnn-shara, that's because #BlackLiesMatter and the usual race-hucksters and racial-strife-pimps like Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson & Co. are the ones creating "racial injustice" where there isn't any. Sorry that you idiots believe black people have no agency. So yes, we dismiss the insane demands of entitled little punks outright. They are just purely racist trolls who essentially want segregation and superior rights  and entitlements for "People of Color".Here's some advice: How about instead of moaning how hard life is because you got into Harvard/Princeton/Yale/etc. you go and work hard to be a credit to yourself and your family. And maybe try something other than social anthropology, sociology, politicial "science", psychology, Gender Studies, and African American studies for once? Your success or failure in life is entirely down to you and you can't plead injustice because life isn't fair. Better get used to it. Your life has been more "fair" already since you are at an Ivy and even with your shit sociology degree can get into any MBA programme and investment banking internship you want just because (a) you're at the institution you're at and (b) you're black.

<comment>There are tens of millions of white people living in poverty, many for generations going back to the 1800s. That hunger strike dude at Missouri has been in college for 7 years and his father makes millions of dollars every year as a railroad executive. Can you not see why there is resentment when he and his academic enablers then tell those tens of millions of white people, most of whom have never done a racist thing in their life and whose ancestors never owned slaves, that they have more privilege than him?</comment>

<comment>As Americans we cannot allow our universities to remain dominated by disgusting, Republican-voting racists.</comment>

<comment>I'm invoking Poe's law on this one, because I can't tell if this is parody of extremism or a sincere expression of it.  I'd hope readers realize higher education is about the furthest thing possible from some bastion of Republican thinking.</comment>

<comment>Higher education is racist, only Republicans can be racist ergo Higher Ed is a "bastion of Republican thinking."Maybe if you stopped tone-policing for 5 minutes you'd realize what was happening.</comment>

<comment>In other words, parody, which I partly suspected, hence me mentioning Poe's law.</comment>

<comment>But Wilson was a democrat. </comment>

<comment>Clearly, we need a law past forbidding any speech, writing, or thought about anything that happened or anyone who lived before, say, Nov. 4, 2008.</comment>

<comment>'We tried to root what we felt in parties that didn’t play music we liked, in very strange and palpably elitist traditions, in buildings with names of men who did not want us there.'Wow Princeton has elitist traditions? Who knew? And parties played music you didn't like?</comment>

<comment>Yes, parties played music she didn't like.What kind of music does she like?I like Motown, R & B, 70s soul music, Sam Cooke.</comment>

<comment>Well, as Sam Cooke is the greatest singer to have lived, I don't blame you for liking him.In other words, you've got1. Sam Cooke2. Elvis3. Eddie Vedder/ Shane McGowan/ Ronnie Drew</comment>

<comment>I agree that Sam Cooke is one of the greatest singers ever.Are you familiar with the English/British singer James Hunter? He openly seeks that Sam Cooke style, even the SC accent.Why can't there be music written and performed by young Black Americans now?It's like with boxing, young Black African Americans used to be so good at boxing and popular music, now I have a hard time finding anything that I can listen to, they don't seem to play instruments anymore, everything is techno.With boxing, the only Black American boxers of any note is Floyd Merriweather and he weighs ~ 80 lbs. If he was mouthing off at the bar I will tell him to pipe down or get out of the bar.</comment>

<comment>I think Smokey Robinson does a pretty good falsetto imitation of Sam Cooke. I haven't heard James Hunter.Raphael Saadiq, while not being conventionally young I suppose, is a great artist. Michael Kiwanuka is a good young british singer. The rest is just cultural diversity, things change fashions come and go.</comment>

<comment>yes, but this hideous Black Hip Hop Rap Music has come, but never gone.It hasn't been terrible music styles come and go. Black Hip Hop Rap music has been the dominant Black popular music style for ~ 25 years!How long did the Black Death bubonic plague last in Europe?</comment>

<comment>A lot longer than 25 years. I don't think your serious about rap. it has it's place and their are able performers but I have only a passing, if any, interest in it. There's no reason to suppose others wouldn't like it.</comment>

<comment>The author makes a point about studying in a building named after someone who didn't want him there.  Simon Wiesenthal (Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter) took great pleasure in celebrating his hundredth birthday in Hitler's favorite hotel in Vienna.  He served a kosher meal to hundreds of people whom Hitler hated right in the same place where he used to stay.  Maybe you should consider leaving the building names alone so you can walk in and laugh at the thought of the old bigot rolling over in his grave.</comment>

<comment>I cannot cite the book's title, alas -- perhaps it didn't make it to print -- but I once edited a collection of memoirs by Ukrainian Jews. One was named Adolph Hitler. His attitude was, "He took my family; I won't let him take my name."Quixotic, perhaps, but noble and courageous.</comment>

<comment>Mr Wiesenthal either spent his hundredth birthday doing that heart-warming, colorful story or he spent it the same way as his 99th, 98th, and 97th birthdays: resting in his coffin in Israel. One of the two.</comment>

<comment>I loved that story Troll_In_Training wrote, and just assumed it was true. Then I got to this reply.This is one of the funniest things I've read in awhile. Thanks for your dry sense of humor.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the fact check.  I'm going to go find the documentary where I saw this years ago.  I guess I mis-remembered him being 100 years old but he did have that birthday party (He was really old at the time.  I think it was his last birthday.) and he did make it a final FU to the Nazis.</comment>

<comment>There has been no progress because there is so little left to be done, but those with a lot invested in whiny racial grievances simply cannot accept success.

<comment>There is a massive amount to be done, but not by white people, because we aren't the problem anymore and haven't been for decades.  If you want to know why there aren't more black kids at Princeton look at why there aren't more black kids graduating high school with high levels of subject competency.</comment>

<comment>Well said.  </comment>

<comment>Students at Yale University (Black, White, various Asians, various sexual orientations) in New Haven CT do have legitimate safety concerns. New Haven CT is a very rough, high crime area where students and people who work there have the REAL safety issue of being mugged, robbed, raped or sometimes killed.Students at Yale University or Princeton including affirmative action "Black" students whining that they feel unsafe by hearing some speech, seeing article in a newspaper or online, seeing some portrait of a politically incorrect university founder, well is judged to be the whining of children that haven't grown up.</comment>

<comment>When the Supreme Court strikes down affirmative action, will that apply to private schools like Yale?If it doesn't, I expect the current racial breakdown to remain as it is, and black students to continue to feel underprepared and like they 'don't belong.'</comment>

<comment>Yes.  Because government funding will be predicated on it.</comment>

<comment>Turkson is typical of how race politics really erases gender issues despite all the empty "intersectionality" talk. Black women in America face rape, domestic violence, and, in the case of those of recent African ancestry, female genital mutilation that utterly dwarfs all the police brutality and white racist violence combined by orders of magnitude. Yet Turkson cannot even feign genuine interest in these issues.  Her celebrated 'recklessness' finds her bombastically talking about 'demanding their body back' from the America that is guilt to its "bloodline."  </comment>

<comment>So when Christians are persecuted by a totalitarian dictator, does that give them the right to burn down buildings and riot?I want a simple yes or no answer, no Libtardsplaining.</comment>

<comment>Just curious: when has that ever happened in the history of the world?  Rome, shortly into the Common Era?</comment>

<comment>French Revolution. Its amazing how poorly educated Americans are. Well, those who went through government run schools that is.Look up "infernal columns", "September massacres", and the war in Vendee. The proto communist running France at this time were at war with Catholics. They used the military to run a genocide in the Vendee which was largely Catholic. Thousands of men, woman, and children were murdered by the leftist revolutionary proto-communist government in France. The Jacobens wanted to replace Christianity with a cult of reason. And murdering entire regions was just a detail in the plan.</comment>

<comment>Debatable.</comment>

<comment>Of course - why would t they teach that in American public schools? That's just important history that everyone should know. </comment>

<comment>Khmer Rouge, Stalin, Lenin, Uncle Adolph (One of the victims of the final solution were Jehovah Witnesses etc). During the French revolution, they loaded barges with bound priests and then sank the vessels. Most people try to hide ignorance, you seem to relish it.</comment>

<comment>Look up "Nantes' weddings".</comment>

<comment>Ah, Rome.  Pagan barbarians sacked it.  Pagan Romans tried to blame the Christians.  They particularly pointed out the shamelessness of Christian women who, having suffered rape, didn't kill themselves.</comment>

<comment>Campus politics about safe spaces etc and Ferguson riots are two *completely* different things. There is probably more sympathy for the Ferguson rioters, which says a lot. Campus ninnies are just young elitists who want everything upsetting eliminated from view; a typical response of elites.

<comment>Woodrow Wilson gave "colored people" segregated spaces away from white people to prevent friction.  Now he's hated by "people of color" demanding segregated spaces away from white people to prevent friction.You can't make this stuff up...</comment>

<comment>There was a whole series last summer on NPR about how black people didn't like Seattle. They didn't feel discriminated against. That wasn't the problem. The problem was that there were too many white people here. The people they interviewed didn't feel at all bad about using their names. They all wanted to move to Atlanta.Can you imagine if a white person said this about living a city with too many blacks? He would be framed as a racist. But these black folks on NPR were portrayed as people just wanting to live with similar people in a community of people they felt were similar. It was ok.Such a weird double standard.</comment>

<comment>They fail to grasp the meaning of the term "minority."I've heard once of some soldiers going somewhere, and some of the blacks flatly refused to believe that there were very few blacks.  They were so annoying that a (black) sergeant graphically demonstrated using differently colored objects how outnumbered blacks are in the general population.Apparently this not only shut them up but made them a lot less cocky thereafter.</comment>

<comment>Scary thing is, these are our future economic and political leaders. And I thought the current bunch had become decayed and incompetent! The pipeline is looking downright nasty.</comment>

<comment>No one will give a whined a job. They will find whatever legal way there is to deny them a job. I refuse to make a judgment call on the merits of their arguments, but I'm pretty sure no company will want to deal with someone who isn't 100% into anything but getting the job done.Safe places in universities are paid for, essentially, by the students. A safe space for an employee is an added cost to the employer. </comment>

<comment>Never thought of it that way. Very enlightening. </comment>

<comment>Progress is stagnant because the biggest barrier now isn't anything white people can move out of the way since it is the actions of the minorities themselves that hinders their advancement.  You shouldn't be protesting at Universities.  You should be protesting single parent homes and gangs and drugs and violence and generational welfare usage and poverty and the degenerate culture that spawns roughly 50% of the murderers in our society.  But ain't nobody got time for that, luckily that's what Tumblr and the culture of recreational outrage and useless protest is all about.</comment>

Real people are dealing with real problems, like student loans, exploitative tuitions, the pandemic of sexual harrassment on campus, the slavist college sports system. GET REAL !</comment>

<comment>"After Darren Wilson was not indicted"Does it matter that the Department of Justice, headed by Eric Holder and at the direction of President Obama, also confirmed that Wilson shot in self-defense?If you want to know why protests for Brown fall on deaf ears, you might want to start with the fact that every shred of evidence produced from that case pointed to Brown being a criminal who grabbed a cops gun and later, suicide charged him. Acknowledge that and then we can talk about changing building names.</comment>

<comment>Dude...these people still can't deal with the facts of this case.  They live in an alternate universe.</comment>

<comment>They got angry over the wrong case and lost credibility when it came to the more dubious and more likely instances of police abuse. Then they dismissed the similar cases that occurred to whites and lost even more credibility and good will.</comment>

<comment>I know, right? There is a constant stream of police abuses and they stick with the one where the officer was cleared by the freaking justice department. </comment>

<comment>Ah, but that was the point.  If they pointed at actual injustice, things might get done.  Abusive police might be disciplined or fired.  That would take all the steam out of their grievances.They NEED illegitimate issues.  They NEED no one to give them what they demand because it's monstrously unjust.</comment>

<comment>Here's the explanation at length:http://slatestarcodex.com/2014...</comment>

<comment>I was suprised when I read that as well. Are there literally large groups of people who live in an alternate reality? How is this country supposed to take them seriously if they can't even come to grips with the truth that that narrative about Darren Wilson and the kid having his hands up was just bulls**t. Or as my old man says - that dog just don't hunt, son. </comment>

<comment>The Necessary Foolishness of Campus Protests - FTFY!anything the MSM can do to make black people look like FOOLS is JOB ONE!</comment>

<comment>of course you're widely dismissed when you make asinine demands such as "acknowledge your white privilege".</comment>

<comment>Well, it's something that ought to be acknowledged, because its existence is pretty easy to demonstrate.</comment>

<comment>Tell me about my white privilege?</comment>

<comment>It's generally invisible to the privileged, for one thing.Steven Colbert summed it up really well once when he said "I don't see color! The only reason I know I'm white is that the police call me 'sir." Still, that's one of the more glaring examples; it mostly manifests in subtler ways.In any case demanding to be taught something in such an implicitly-adversarial manner suggests you've already made up your mind about it, so offering up a Clif's Notes version of readily-available information would be pointless.</comment>

<comment>Purple, with sparkles!</comment>

<comment>That's fitting.</comment>

<comment>So you don't agree with the "social construction of gender" thesis?That is, you must be assuming "purple with sparkles" is something inherently "feminine," or "girly" as otherwise it's just a particular wavelength along the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum interspersed with small pieces of highly-reflective metal or plastic.What if my toenails were painted in "aggressive purple" with "manly sparkles" instead? Or if I got my AA-12 shotgun painted Hot Pink? Would that make it a "girly" assault shotgun (even though pink used to be "for boys" and blue was "for girls")?</comment>

<comment>Here's what I think. Male monkeys play with balls and vehicles, female monkeys prefer dolls. So much for the social construct theory. At best, it might inflate some aspects of a natural phenomenon.If you want an actual example of social constructs and gender, look no further than the failure of adult attempts to androgynize play in Sweden, despite the full force of the state, the education system, and the business community. The toddlers are just too young to comprehend how to conform against their nature.</comment>

<comment>And police brutality has nothing to do with their unions? Wow. Ok. Sure. Other nations don't allow the police to do their own investigations. Don't you think perhaps the real problem is that the government unions in the US are so powerful that the cops do their own investigations and under their own union agreed to rules?BTW, a comedian is out to get laughs. He isn't an actual deep thinker. He has a staff of writers. Here is how cops actually treat white people: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=...And this cop kept his job!That cop shot a 70 year old veteran. The old guy was getting a walking cane and the cop, acting like a scared little baby, shot him. How in the world is that tolerated! But look, because the victim is white nobody cares. </comment>

<comment>Good god, seriously?FWIW, the police unions, esp. the FOP, is generally where the most corrupt cops tend to congregate, and investigating themselves is patently absurd. Granted, that has nothing to do with my comment, but whatever.And comics tell jokes. Satirists (like Colbert, or Voltaire, or Bill Hicks, etc.) point out otherwise-awkward truths with a degree of "lightness" (in the Italo Calvino sense of the term). It's a vital service to humanity.In any case, I was speaking broadly about our culture in general so anecdotal exceptions to a general rule are not relevant.</comment>

<comment>Hint:  as a general rule, you can tell that anyone who says, "You have this problem you can't see, but I can fix it -- give me stuff to do that" is a conman.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but that's not what's happening in the context of 'privilege.'Just because some choose to willfully ignore it (and the reasoning behind declaring it such) doesn't mean it's not a valid concept.</comment>

<comment>That is EXACTLY what is happening in the context of privilege.  People make demands on white people, because of their white privilege, and when the white people deny it, ascribe their resistance to their privilege.</comment>

<comment>Could you be any more vague?</comment>

<comment>Countering an argument with an anecdote means you don't understand the nature of this type of discussion.</comment>

<comment>You've just shown you don't what an anecdote is, because that is not an anecdote. Even if it was: homelessness isn't just some trivial personal story. It's a structural reality.Apparently, you are unwilling to confront the total departure from reality that the "privilege" narrative represents.</comment>

<comment>You said "a homeless guy," not "homelessness."Granted, it was a fictional anecdote, i.e. hypothetical (in case you thought I was unaware of the term), but I phrased it that way in hopes you might not just be playing rhetorical "gotcha" and would reasonably acknowledge that my comment was just a shorthand summary of a large, complex topic.In any case you have not in any way even so much as addressed the concept of privilege, you've just tossed a hypothetical (happy?) into the mix and somehow concluded that that magically invalidates it.</comment>

<comment>No. I gave an example so you could show me how it actually applies in real life situations, rather than purely as an abstraction. I know; you'd like to keep it abstract, theoretical, and at some distance from actual reality. But indulge me. If you can.</comment>

<comment>Take a Sociology 101 class. Or maybe Sociology 99.In any case how the heck did we get to the point where someone's ignorance of the basics of an academic discipline apparently means it's up to those who allude to it to teach those basics?</comment>

<comment>I think you missed the part about how hard it was to get people to do that laborious work. They tried using white indentured servants and they often just left - or finished their period of servitude and then left. So they tried native Americans but they knew the land and just took off first chance they got.So black slaves were the only ready source of labor for the fields. By the time there were enough non black slaves to work the fields, it was way to late. </comment>

<comment>You actually read the articles here? Why?</comment>

<comment>Notice how the student defense pieces no longer defend most of the things that critics correctly contend are absurd, they simply say they're a result of the real issue. Well, sorry, but some people actually notice that there's an over-emotional component to these protests (and occasional light violence), that they enforce odious political correctness, and that they regularly undermine the First Amendment and the broader principles of free speech (which some people actually do care about).Also: there are gigantic, systematic issues with policing culture in this country, a lot of them with a specific racial component (read the DoJ's report on Ferguson for a particularly egregious example). But the Mike Brown story is simply not a good representation of it and the Wilson verdict was justified (read the DoJ report on this, released the same day as the other DoJ report I mentioned). It's a triumph of a narrative over objective reality, but looking at the nature of these protests, the symbolic is generally elevated to a level above the substantive anyway.</comment>

<comment>There are so many things about these Black grievance, Leftist student "protests"/assaults that I oppose.1) At least 90% + of the supposed RACIST hate crimes, incidents turn out to be hoaxes (see Duke Lacrose team rape hoax, Oberlin college students hysterical about KKK terrorism on campus, some Black AA staff member getting hysterical when a Notre Dame student was reading a the book "When Notre Dame stood up to the KKK" - what was she upset that the book celebrate Notre Dame Catholics opposing the KKK?)2) The Black student leaders are almost always spoiled, filthy rich children of affluence. The leader of the University of Missouri BlackLivesMatter takeover of the campus Jonathon Butler  is the son of multi $ millionaire family. The shrieking mixed race female student at Yale shouting down her housing mentor over the some Holloween costume she didn't like - she's from a town in Connecticut where the media home costs ~ $900,000 including her home.3) The Black student "demands" never ever include anything positive, like taking serious courses, getting real education.Most regular citizens would be fine with Black American students studying realAfrican history - learning the geography, languages, histories of current countries, past civilizations like Egypt. Do these spoiled, eternally protesting Black students even know the names of current African countries?Anyone else noticed that these BlackLivesMatter protesters/thugs have changed the name of their studies "demands" from "African studio" to "Black studies" - it's just hate White people studies as these lazy spoiled brats will leave college without knowing much or really anything about Africa. It's all about Black power, insulting hating White people.These spoiled brats should have to do a 1 year stint in an Israeli type military training before they are allowed on an American campus, or any other type of campus.</comment>

<comment>and how many of you and your fellow protestors are majoring in a STEM field or planning on pursuing a professional degree? because all I see is a bunch of entitled liberal arts majors.</comment>

<comment>This movement has officially jumped the shark with the demand that Lynch Memorial Hall change it's name. </comment>

<comment>The fact that you complain about not fitting in or that people around you do not listen to your type of music only gives credence to the argument that these protests are frivolous.  Many 18-19 yr olds go to college and do not fit in, no matter of race etc. You claim to be in favor of diversity, yet complain that you are different.  There are plenty of universities out there where you could "feel at home" - you chose Princeton. Regarding buildings being named for past-life racists etc - I would think it a source of pride that you, as a person of color, get to earn an education at one of the most prestigious universities in the world as a chance to demonstrate how wrong those people were and how things have changed - and they have.  How great is it that you are living proof that progress has been made?  This is no longer the 1960's where minorities were routinely barred from higher education.  You are there, You have the opportunity.  So stop comparing your campus protests to the 1960's.  There is a huge difference.   A building named for Woodrow Wilson is not an example of "systematic racism".  The system is designed to prevent discrimination  - just look at the laws in place regarding this issue.  Individuals acting as racists or bigots is an entirely different matter and that will exist forever from all sides no matter how many university presidents resign and buildings get renamed for non-offensive individuals.</comment>

<comment>My wife dropped $150k and now she's basically an indentured servant. She can't quite bc I can't pay her loans and mine on one salary, and when she's working, after loans and daycare she's net NEGATIVE on money. It's a total scam.</comment>

<comment>The effect of student loans was to allow colleges to capture the marginal value of the education.</comment>

<comment>I think The Atlantic should change its name because it represents the ocean across which the slave trade occurred.</comment>

<comment>People get triggered by oceans and the thought of maybe drowning in one. The Atlantic is not a safe space for potential drowning victims.</comment>

<comment>Is that an example of a "microdistraction?"</comment>

<comment>It makes me feel bad. It makes my heart want to pee in its pants.While we are at it we should abolish the Democratic Party since it supported segregation.</comment>

<comment>"Please stop focusing on the fact of the Mizzou hunger strike itself, look at why did we have to get here in the first place"Well here is the problem...what led to it was two students were called an N by non-students. One on campus, one off. The university president, after being hounded by Butler, agreed to make diversity training mandatory for all students, faculty, administration, and staff. Butler said that wasn't enough. Then Butler and a few others block the homecoming parade. The u-prez has his car back away, Butler launches himself at the car like JJ Reddick trying to draw a charge at Duke. Later he claims the car "hit him." Then poopswastika, then hunger strike. At no point during this entire episode was there a chance for the U to do anything of tangible value. So when the CAUSE of the protest has no actionable item, the MESSAGE of the protest appears like what it is, misguided and unintelligible.</comment>

<comment>As white people, we should police ourselves. We should make damn sure no one is dropping N bombs to college kids. And we should make sure we punish people who make poop swastikas, or people who play with their poop at all.That's as far as I'm willing to go. But what's right is right. We all get mad when black people get bent with the cops in places like Chicago while many neighborhoods in Chicago are awfully violent. We say, clean your house first. That applies to us as well. </comment>

<comment>That said, we have no idea if that poopswastika was created by a white person. Kean College had a kid from BLM who created a fake twitter account to lob threats at herself. This Butler kid seems like a spoiled enough attention wh0re to pull a stunt like that.The additional point that the student body president is both black and gay should not go unnoticed. All this protesting implies that the campus is a hotbed of racial tension, but Butler liked it enough to become a career student and all indications are, it's a nice place to go to school.</comment>

<comment>"We should make damn sure no one is dropping N bombs to college kids."how?  Big Brother level surveillance would only catch all the cases, not stop them.Oh, I know!  We will build a large "safe space" where the kids can live and carry out of the necessary business of living, carefully filtered to keep out all the awful white people.We can call it a "ghetto."</comment>

<comment>Also these Black grievenses protests/riots/shakedowns never, EVER acknowledge the fact that the United States is on balance a good country and has been on balance a good country for Black Americans and other non White European Americans.If our country really is THE MOST EVIL RACIST COUNTRY IN HISTORY AS BAD AS THE NAZIs than why do tends of millions of non White, non European people try to immigrate in to our country every year?Basically the entire population of Haiti and 90% plus of the population of sub Sahara Black Africa wants to move to the United States or Europe.Why is this case, or these people masochists and insist on subjecting themselves to be terrorized and abused by White racist America?WT*?</comment>

<comment>Just because we may be the healthiest patient in the cancer ward doesn't mean we should declare ourselves cancer-free.</comment>

<comment>Or maybe we're being told it's cancer (by people who would personally financially benefit from us believing we have cancer) when really it's just a series of migraines...</comment>

<comment>Well, we have several different types to deal with at the moment, and some pose a more acute threat than others, but they're all worth curing. The biggest is probably corporatism. "Unregulated growth" is the definition of "cancer," and that's also the mandated priority of a "publicly" traded corporation (and if left untreated, it leads to the same outcome in both contexts).</comment>

<comment>How is cancer related to this? </comment>

<comment>Please tell me you're being facetious and are not really that dense...</comment>

<comment>I fear for the future.Heck, I fear for the present.</comment>

<comment>Students do not feel isolated and unwelcome. They claim they feel isolated and unwelcome in order to sustain their hero/martyr complex. They want to be a group of rag tag little revolutionaries so bad they WISH the campus officials were hurling the N word around on loudspeakersOPPRESS ME!!! OPPRESS ME PLEASE!!! That is the hidden message here. It stems i think from parenting and school systems of the upper rich classes that emphasize the special little snowflake syndrome. With wealthy minorities too (I mean, come on, Yale), they have this complex where they feel like they abandoned their poor cousins in the inner cities, because they are doing so well, so in order to ease this guilt they make pretend that they are just as "oppressed" as their more "authentic" cousins in poverty.everyone needs to get their head out of their ass.</comment>

<comment>We are gonna need a helluva lot of crowbars.</comment>

<comment>No kidding. I started my collegiate career at a community college in Flint, Michigan. Think it's tough going to an Ivy League school as a minority? Try going to a community college in one of the poorest cities in America as a minority. That's right - I am white and was the minority.All that white privilege did nothing for me I assure you that. </comment>

<comment>So Asians are protesting, right?  We lynched them during the Gold Rush and a Democratic president threw them into concentration camps during WWII.It's amazing how discrimination stops against dark-skinned students with good grades in business or science.</comment>

<comment>I was totally dismissive of these protests until I heard there were parties that didn't play music these students liked.  How horrible.  The administration must end this human rights violation now!  </comment>

<comment>And I bet if you did play music they liked then that would a crime of "cultural appropriation" and they would scream and cry about that.I want them to stop speaking English because clearly they are appropriating my culture and its deeply offensive.</comment>

<comment>Damned if ya do, damned if you don't.  Best to stop walking on eggshells and do and say whatever you like.</comment>

<comment>I don't think their goal is to stop this or that "oppression" from happening.It's to exert power over everyone else by forcing everyone to stop doing things one way and do things the way THEY decide. It's more about exerting power than anything else.</comment>

<comment>Spot on.  These are the future statists and we all know what the current statists want.</comment>
