<comment>"What explains Reagan’s remarkable transformation from Cold War hawk to nuclear peacemaker?"This just shows how delusion affects some on the right too. Yes, let us ignore all we know from history: If you want peace, then prepare for war. And it validates another rule from history: What we learn from history is that we don't learn from history.Why do we even bother with history? Most never knew much in the first place. Anybody bringing up warnings from the past are promptly ignored.Let us see how the future is different from the past: If you want peace, then prepare for peace. This is true because all men are good at heart. Anne Frank said that not too long before men killed her.</comment>

<comment>Compare the impression of Reagan offered by the author with this very recent post containing quotes of those who knew him as presidenthttp://www.salon.com/2015/12/2...</comment>

<comment>Ridiculous to an extent that only Salon is capable of.Reagan was hands-off in terms of management and mercurial in terms of temperament, but he was never a puppet. Even in 1988, it was his weight that allowed Bush Senior to recover from his primary disasters all while guiding us through our new relations with the Soviet Union. While this management style combined with ideology sometimes led to disaster-Iran-Contra being the penultimate example-it also led to some tremendous successes, including having an incredibly smooth relationship with a Democrat dominated Congress. America believed in itself again after those eight years-that might sound tacky, but that's no trivial achievement after the 70s. There were no games with Reagan, and everybody loved that.And while Reagan was definitely not an intellectual powerhouse on the level of a Nixon or a Clinton, with a library like that of a graduate student, I don't know how anyone who has ever read his diaries can come to the conclusion that he was stupid. Nor is it all that relevant-once you've gotten past a certain point in IQ, other factors become more important in evaluating performance as a President. If that weren't the case, Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter would be on Mount Rushmore right now. (As a general note, I don't think we've ever had a stupid President in the conventional sense of the term. Dumb men just don't get through the process.)</comment>

<comment>How could you conclude that he was stupid? Because he was always saying something stupid.Trees pollute more than cars.The homeless choose to live that way.The Contras are the moral equivalent of the Founding Fathers.A volcano pollutes more than all the cars in the country.Then there was the time he just blanked out and Nancy had to whisper to him what he should say.</comment>

<comment>An alternative approach could be to remember that I was replying to the claim that President Reagan was stupid b/c of some select quotes  and so I provided some that could demonstrate the same thing about President Obama. Please consider the possibility that perhaps anybody in public life who  constantly  has his/her words parsed is going occasionally to mispeak, and thus it might be best not to include from such gaffes that such people are stupid.But conclude what you will b/c I don't  turn up   similar mistakes by W, etc...</comment>

<comment>"but he was never a puppet" . . . . Tell that to Nancy and/or her astrologer.</comment>

<comment>W is a moron.</comment>

<comment>I don't think so. Again: like Reagan, not an intellectual powerhouse on the level of some other Presidents. He certainly did a lot of dumb things and said some dumb things too. And it's true that Bush was dangerous not because he was some evil Machiavellian like some of his aides-it's because he thought he really was doing the right thing.But he himself was not dumb. George W. Bush was an Ivy League graduate who spent time on his father's campaign and clearly understood politics and how to connect to people-that wasn't how he portrayed himself on the campaign trail, of course, but that was part of the game, lowballing expectations. Don't underestimate people. Both Gore and McCain did in 2000, and they ended up sucker  punched. That wasn't *all* due to Turd Blossom's machinations.It's possible to think that someone was an absolute disaster as President and wasn't one of the brighter ones without falling into the "American people just like dumbasses" trap. </comment>

<comment>Such illiterate, hateful nonsense, however, is just  what we expect from you, friend.What did you do for New Years?  Shoot your dog?</comment>

<comment>Haha, right. You know why "all men" aren't good at heart? Because there is no personal quality, I repeat, NO PERSONAL QUALITY, that is shared by all of mankind. NONE. Not all men are bad, and not all are good. There's many of the former, and many of the latter. To say anything else is absolutely mind-bogglingly idealistic, which is sadly required to be a progressive.</comment>

<comment>Wel, you are truly bad, so your point is taken.  Aren't you disgusted with yourself?   I'll bet your mother is!</comment>

<comment>Haha I always love it when people that don't even know me tell me I'm a bad guy or something. And no, I'm not quite disgusted with myself at all, no, if I was, I would probably change. And I ain't had the pleasure to ask my mother if she's disgusted by me yet, but considering she put up with me living in her house for quite a while my guess would be no. But I'm still good at heart, though, right? Same as Hitler and Stalin.</comment>

<comment>You do not read carefully.</comment>

<comment>Ahh...so when you said that you were glad I was dead you weren't wishing for my death? Cause, you know, I'm alive and kickin' here, so that's what I thought.

<comment>If you want war,  prepare for war. Build the doomsday weapons, put them on standby, and then simply wait for inherent human madness or an accident to trigger the doomsday machines.The existence of nuclear weapons proves the utter stupidity of the human race, and proves that emotions (fear primarily) precede and rule over reason.We as a species, sooner or later are fucked. We have the ability to see and understand what we are doing, and where we are going. We are capable of learned behaviors, so we could as a species take the path to survival as a species, but we do not. We we build the weapons of species suicide, and we proceed to destroy the living ecosystem, the biosphere upon which our survival depends.We are fucked, and we richly deserve it</comment>

<comment>"Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, former President Richard Nixon, and others gave Reagan their opinion that Gorbachev represented no change at all."They predicted that possibly the most transformative leader in the world since the end of WW2 represented no change.  Well, apart from that Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?</comment>

<comment>Ronald Reagan was a very unique figure in US politics, and in terms of Republican Party dynamics. He was actually the only one who immediately sensed that Gorbachev was a real change, and I'd argue this was because of his positive idealism as opposed to the more cynical realist mandarins of the GOP both inside of his administration and out. GHWB, in contrast, came from the old school Republican realist milieu, and Clinton was a neoliberal. For Gorbachev, he was the only one who got it.Everybody else just had a hard time believing that such a man could come through Soviet politics and stay his ground. But then again, Gorbachev didn't last forever, nor did the nature of Russia change with shock treatment capitalism. </comment>

<comment>Reagan was pretty much a figurehead by his second term though, and arguably in parts of his first. The neocons in control of US policy didn't even tell him about Iran-Contra!</comment>

<comment>No. He knew exactly what was going on, if not all the details (Reagan was much better than Nixon or the early Clinton at sensing when he didn't want to get involved in something) and lied through his teeth. Reeves, Brands, and his own diary makes this pretty clear, and Bush Senior de facto headed the NSC of the time. I don't see how he couldn't have known about such a huge operation, especially given Reagan's near obsession with Nicaragua.Reagan was a far slyer political operator than people think. Playing dumb was one of his tricks. It wasn't a new one-Roosevelt and Eisenhower were also very fond of playing the "slow old man" with potentially troublesome but gullible Congressmen. But Reagan was the one who truly perfected the art.</comment>

<comment>There are two narratives of Reagan, yours is the second one. I think it has some merit but is not bullet proof.</comment>

<comment>"Reagan was a far slyer political operator than people think. Playing dumb was one of his tricks."It was not playing, it was the real thing. Despite his outward sayings about disarmament and elimination of nuclear weapons, he was the biggest war monger to come around, eagerly and glady latching onto the Democrat's willingness to spend and the neo-con desire to spend every nickel possible on their pet project du jour. All the while racking up debt like no administration before him and we're all still paying for Reagan's nonsense today.</comment>

<comment>My perception is GW was a figurehead too, until the end of his second term when he turned on Mr. Cheney. I would bet Mom & Dad Bush were handing out some stern advice by that time.</comment>

<comment>Given that he was a protege of Andropov, followed his domestic policies for hsi first two years (esp. anti-religious campaigns) admired Jaruzelski and stepped up the Soviet war in Afghanistan during his first two years, there were reasons to think this...</comment>

<comment>Sure, and I'm certainly not calling Kissinger, Nixon, and 90% of the foreign policy establishment idiots for believing what they believed.  The point, really, is that even very smart people have severe limitations in predicting the future or reading the minds of the enemy.We should always keep that in mind when discussing diplomacy.</comment>

<comment>They were actually two sides of the same coin, rather than a schizophrenic change in Reagan's ideology and personality. (This is something I keep seeing when evaluating Presidents-often the contradictions are simply different manifestations of their personality.) If you look at the diaries, this becomes quite clear, just as how his deep belief in economic freedom was a result of a deep belief in human freedom-ergo, Reagan's *very* strong anti-Communism. This sometimes backfired when he supported "imperfect" democracies, in terms of a somewhat shallow belief in what could constitute it. But it's not for nothing that in the second half of his administration, the world saw the biggest explosion in democratic regimes in history. We always talk about the Warsaw Pact, but we never talk about South Korea, Brazil, the Philippines, or Chile. Reagan's belief in democracy and economic freedom was hardly cynical.Reagan hardly hid his dislike of nukes-even during the early part of his administration, Reagan labeled nuclear weapons as abominations. Reagan couldn't believe throughout the first few years of his administration, until around 1983, that the Soviets actually thought that anyone would consider a preemptive nuclear strike. As far as the article is concerned, part of the reason Reagan and Gorbachev got along so well in terms of personal chemistry was that both had strong idealistic streaks. It was a very different personal chord than say, Nixon and Brezhnev, all dark, crude, cynical and contemptuous of ideology. This meant it had a different set of strengths and weaknesses. But Gorbachev came through the still tough world of Soviet politics in the 80s to quite instantly go that way, especially in his fatal continuation of exorbitant Soviet aid to the 3rd World, aid that the Soviet economy could hardly afford. </comment>

<comment>"We always talk about the Warsaw Pact, but we never talk about South Korea, Brazil, the Philippines, or Chile"but as bad as they were, still better than the Pact Nations. They never sent troops or arms to invade other nations</comment>

<comment>The continuing myth of St Ronnie. His war of attrition is what beat the Soviets. And, he armed both Saddam and the Ayatollah.</comment>

<comment>No. But we should give him credit where it is due. To say that Reagan won the Cold War is oversimplifying things. To say he had nothing to do with its ending is the same.And on being good enough of a politician to SOMEHOW get away with simultaneously undermining our policy by arming the enemy and then spending the profits on a bunch of useless idiots in Nicaragua. (Say what you will about Nixon and Watergate, it didn't involve selling arms to terrorists.) Casey and Reagan just could never accept the reality that the Contras would never succeed without overt US help. That's just sad.</comment>

<comment>No, he didn't. The main arms supplier to Iraq was the former Soviet Union, Eastern Bloc, and France. He never armed the Ayatollah.He did, however, win the Cold War. Which really pisses off you lefties.</comment>

<comment>Of course he did, and Israel helped. You must be a "War Stories" with Ollie North, fan.</comment>

<comment>We had zero direct weapons sales to Iraq or Iran under Reagan. Nada. None. We don't make Mig jets and T72 tanks, moron.</comment>

<comment>Nice asterik, by qualifying with the word "direct". Thats right, America's beyotch, Israel, carried out the actual sale and transfer.</comment>

<comment>Which is still beside the point, and my point still stands. We were never a major arms supplier to either country under the Ayatollah and Saddam. They switched used Soviet, Eastern Bloc and Chinese/NK weapons systems.</comment>

<comment>You are a blithering idiot without a clue or understanding of history.  It is morons like you that make being an American embarrassing.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Maybe you ought to look at the actual numbers. The former USSR supplied over 68% of weapons systems to Iraq. France supplied over 12 percent, with China at over 11%. The US only suplied .5% of all arms to Saddam's regime.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...Saying that the US was a major supportet of Saddam's Iraq, under Reagan or anyone else, is simply false.</comment>

<comment>Sir, with all due respect, if terrorists bombed a US military base and killed about 250 US soldiers, and Mr Obama subsequently abandoned that military base, well I can guess what you would be saying about Mr Obama.Now, let's hear you say the same about Mr Reagan abandoning the military base in Beiruthttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Maybe you failed to read your own link, but if you had you would have seen that the United States not only retaliated after the attacks, but stayed in country for another five months. This was not a permanent base.Further, I have no idea why you posted this in response to my post above. It doesn't make any sense.</comment>

<comment>Are you serious?  Reagan sent Rumsfeld as his representative to Saddam and supplied him with materials and intelligence when the entire world knew Saddam was gassing his own people and the Iranians,  Why do you think that desperate GWB did not "claim" the disintegrating WMD found in Iraq?  He knew they would be stamped made in America</comment>

<comment>This is simply false. Rumsfeld going to Iraq had nothing to do with becoming a major arms supplier to Iraq. It was about getting Saddam to flip from the Soviet Union to the United States, which did not happen.Any technology that Saddam got from the US was through false front companies buying from US manufacturers which had no idea they were being duped. There was no direct transfer of any major weapons systems, let alone actual chemical weapons.http://www.nytimes.com/interac...</comment>

<comment>I'm just going to put this here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...From the article, quoting Ted Koppel on ABC's Nightline on 9 June 1992: " '[The] Reagan/Bush administrations permitted—and frequently encouraged—the flow of money, agricultural credits, dual-use technology, chemicals, and weapons to Iraq.'Or how about this juicy little quote from Howard Teicher, then the Political-Military director at the National Security Council -- and, of course, one of the people who accompanied Mr. Rumsfeld to Iraq in 1983: "The CIA, including both CIA Director Casey and Deputy Director Gates, knew of, approved of, and assisted in the sale of non-U.S. origin military weapons, ammunition and vehicles to Iraq. My notes, memoranda and other documents in my NSC files show or tend to show that the CIA knew of, approved of, and assisted in the sale of non-U.S. origin military weapons, munitions and vehicles to Iraq."You're saying that the CIA selling Saddam's Iraq weapons that were not made in America does not constitute a "direct" sale of weapons by the US government to Iraq's? *Very* interesting interpretation of the available data.But hey, whatever helps you sleep at night...right?</comment>

<comment>I never said that the US gave no assistance to Iraq. In fact, in the post you quoted I said just that. We were trying to get Saddam to leave the Soviet's sphere of influence, and also did not want Iran to win the Iran/Iraq war.Having said that, all of our arms shipments amounted to .5% of all of the weapons systems delivered to Iraq. In other words, the overwhelming amount of weapons came from other countries, the largest supplier being the Soviet Union.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...So, once again, you are wrong in your claims.</comment>

<comment>So Presidents Truman through Carter played no part in the cold war?Only Mr Reagan strode and and did it all himself?  Yeah right.Sorry, he was the sitting president when the conditions that gave rise to the cold war shifted after thirty years, and brought it to the end.All bow down in humble reverence for Saint Ronnie.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should debate the actual points of my posts rather than strawmen. I agree that other Presidents helped in containing the Soviet Union and the spread of communism, but there was less support in the Democratic Party after LBJ. In fact, the majority of congressional Democrats actually worked to undermine US anti communist efforts. From eviscerating the CIA to actively supporting despots like Daniel Ortega over Reagan's anti communist agenda, they were ensuring an extension of the Cold War.Finally, it was Reagan's military buildup which pushed the Soviet Union over the edge. They had to invest militarily to keep up, and it bankrupted them. That would not have happened under Carter or Mondale.</comment>

<comment>In my view the U.S. should do everything possible to stay friendly with the Russians, NOT attempt to rekindle the cold war rhetoric constantly ... the Soviet Union is gone and Russia has a much smaller economy ... but they still have the nuclear stockpile - Russia was an ally in World War II and they could be an ally today ...</comment>

<comment>Very true, but they are not crazy pro-LGBT agenda and that makes progressives raging mad.</comment>

<comment>Okay, yes, Russia needs to rekindle the cold war because our culture has shifted to acceptance and inclusion of those with differing sexual preferences. The are millions of gays in Russia, but at least there they are repressed in the closet where they properly belong, right?</comment>

<comment>So, if we are onboard with the political program that exotic sexual preferences are completely normal and healthy, we are Neanderthal knuckle-dragging bigots.  Gotcha.</comment>

<comment>No, there is no way that Russia as currently lead and configured could be an American or Western ally, unless the entire West takes a tragic turn for the authoritarian.As someone with dual citizen Russian/American children and a fair bit of experience with current Russian society and culture, the Russian people are not our enemy but the Russian government is not and cannot be our friend.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Do you perform any other tricks?Other then living off hippie slogans and hiding behind the Ronald Raegun bad guy?</comment>

<comment>What isn't mentioned is that Reagan also offered to give our missile defense technology to the Soviets when it was developed, which would have ensured a defense against rogue states for both of them. Gorbachev rejected that option, which killed the treaty.</comment>

<comment>no, it was the fact the he was an idiot.i'm not a doctor and i don't play one on TV</comment>

<comment>When Mr. Reagan was in office, watching how his administration functioned I realized (without negative judgement) that an effective president need not be a towering intellect or even common man smart. He could even be f'ng dumb with Alzheimers. He can get by just fine with telegenic  "great communicator" skills of a grade B actor, backed up by intelligent knowledgeable staff members. Nothing wrong with that if the administration is effective and provides good leadership.</comment>

<comment>"Nothing wrong with that if the administration is effective and provides good leadership." - he didn't.</comment>

<comment>Keep waiting.  I still think he was a disaster. </comment>

<comment>I must be the only person in the United States to think he was neither one of our best Presidents(especially compared with his criminally underrated successor), nor one of our worst(compared to the last couple of decades, the Reagan era was indeed a golden age in terms of intelligence and political efficiency. I cannot imagine the Gipper would be at all impressed with our political class these days-Reagan was a *leader*, like him or not, these people are not).One crucial thing to realize is that Reagan just was a guy who you couldn't help but love, someone who knew how to talk to the people and get them to see the stars. Americans are at heart idealists. In popular memory, that means something, whatever the opinions of academics. It's the same thing as what happened with JFK.</comment>

<comment>Nah.  I agree with you there.  Reagan was still a disaster but Bush Jr, Harding, and Buchanan were a lot worse.</comment>

<comment>When you look at it through the long run, we had a more or less a good run of Presidents from 1933-2000. Even the worse ones weren't truly among our absolute bottom 5 or, honestly, 10.Even in the 70s, Nixon/Ford/Carter >>> Wilson/Harding/Coolidge or especially Fillmore/Pierce/Buchanan. Nixon and Carter did some seriously good and important things along with Nixon inflicting Watergate on nation and Carter's overall lack of political skill and leadership ability when the nation desperately needed it. Ford was merely ineffectual, not harmful, and his policies and decisions are underrated in my opinion-in fact, something I'm fond of telling hardcore Democrats was that him losing in 1976 to Carter probably ensured that Reagan would win the nomination, and likely the election, in 1980. We haven't had a string of truly awful ones-although in foreign policy, I sometimes think later Clinton/Bush II/Obama are getting there on my more pessimistic days-and we are lucky for it.</comment>

<comment>What exactly was wrong with Coolidge?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It's actually pretty simple-I have an unofficial policy of not judging Presidents in terms of historical legacy until they've had a few years out of office. It's just a personal thing.But right now, in my opinion, Obama's legacy isn't headed in the right direction. It's not Bush II level yet, but it doesn't look particularly good either, particularly in foreign policy. The missile announcement from Tehran today doesn't bode well: while I never expected the Iran deal to do anything other than buy time, and I doubt Obama did either, it doesn't look good at the moment. The 2014 midterms also were stunning. ACA, the bank regulations and Cuba will age well, so we will see.The problem with Obama is that more than any other time in our history, we've got people who divide him into the worst President ever-and, of course, someone who hates America-and the creepily hagiographic feel of the Washington Post's recent articles on him. (The people can't appreciate him. Shades of Berthold Brecht.) If you praise or criticize him, one side is just going to go ape. Getting anywhere is a true headache. </comment>

<comment>I suspect that the history books, ten years down the line, may be reasonably kind to Obama and absolutely brutal to Congress. And I don't expect Congress to get any better in the next ten years...they may see 08 as the point where Congress really started to become dysfunctional and go off the rails.</comment>

<comment>How old are you?</comment>

<comment>a golden age?  Do you have the yellow glow of cataracts?</comment>

<comment>Compared to the Eisenhower era in terms of government efficiency? No.But everything is relative, especially with an administration which presides over a major counterintelligence disaster every six months and with a Congress that can't even get a 10 percent approval rating.</comment>

<comment>It is also wonderful to see the GOP gone so extreme that Mr. Reagan would not stand a chance in the GOP at t his time. The delicious irony is that the current GOP worships a delusional mental image of Mr Reagan.</comment>

<comment>The idea the US and USSR would have gotten rid of their nuclear arsenals during the Cold War is an absurd pipedream.</comment>

<comment>Sakharov did have a point on nuclear arms keeping the peace. But unfortunately, in the 21st Century, we see a new threat in networks that don't necessarily want to avoid destruction.</comment>

<comment>Would you rather the missile land on your home town and explode?</comment>

<comment>jiffy pop, jiffy pop, the magic treat, as much fun to nuke as it is to eat...after six months of random PU particles landing all over the planet the net result would be the same, but the buildings would still be standing</comment>

<comment>Future evolved intelligent cockroach archaeologists like that second scenario!</comment>

<comment>Radioactive materials from meteorites burn up in the atmosphere all the time. Even the biggest nuke only has a couple pounds of fissile material. It would burn up into nothing in the atmosphere.</comment>

<comment>Meteorites are as radioactive as an average rock on Earth. Which is way less radioactive than the weapons-grade fissionable material from a MIRV.</comment>

<comment>Not all and again the scale. The amount of fissile material in a nuke is small. The amount of radioactive material that would make it through the atmosphere is going to be less than a sunny day in terms of radiation. We exist because we orbit a giant thermonuclear reaction. The dangers of radiation have been wildly exaggerated. Especially by media which know nothing about radiation or science in general. </comment>

<comment>You dont know shit about radiation or science in general, you have no cause to point fingers at others in that regard, idiot.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Lack of factual knowledge does.</comment>

<comment>https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>The dangers of radiation are real and should not be underplayed. Secondly you should use the same terms when discussing issues. Radiation scientifically means any kind of photons emitted by the sun, which includes visible light and infrared and radio-waves. Those are harmless, mostly. Radiation in terms of nuclear safety refers to high energy gamma and x-ray photons. In cumulative doses those are dangerous.</comment>

<comment>And what would survive burning up from up from reentry wouldn't be dangerous. You'd be talking about sand sized particles spread over hundreds, even thousands of square miles. The amount of radiation in any given spot would be nothing. </comment>

<comment>plutonium whizzing around outer space? the most toxic poison known to man? only creatable in a lab? okthxbye</comment>

<comment>Except it doesn't "whizz around." It burns up in the atmosphere. You average warhead is at biggest less than a compact car most of which isn't fissile material. If an entire space shuttle many times bigger than that disintegrates in the atmosphere think how little of a warhead would ever survive reentry once the shield is destroyed.</comment>

<comment>Umm, if it "burns up," then where does it go? Matter doesn't disappear. Any given rock could get vaporized as it fell through the atmosphere, but then it still exists as vapor. Plutonium vapor in the atmosphere would eventually cool into solid phase, and a fine particulate dust, highly radioactive, would quickly settle to the Earth's surface.</comment>

<comment>Across the entire planet. That means it's dissipated. Radiation is a problem depending on amount. You're talking about dust that that bring less radiation to a given place on Earth than a solar flare. </comment>

<comment>Atoms do not "burn up" in the atmosphere. Plutonium does like oxygen, but just because it is bound with oxygen in plutonium oxide doe not  make any less toxic and lethal.</comment>

<comment>Read my comments. A warhead contains only a couple pounds at most of fissile material. The idea a warhead burning up in reentry would be a problem is laughable.</comment>

<comment>elements like plutonium don't "disintegrate", and they certainly don't become radioactively inert.if they did, we would be launching all our nuclear waste into the atmosphere so it could "disintegrate"</comment>

<comment>Virtually everything so s in reentry. It's why finding materials to make a working heat shield is one of the most difficult things in building anything designed to go into space and then return to Earth. The fissile material in a warhead is not one of those materials. It's not that it's inert it's that the amounts that survive reentry are tiny and scattered over hundreds or thousands of square miles. One dust sized particle of plutonium isn't terribly dangerous. You'd be exposed to more radiation on a sunny day. </comment>

<comment>"One dust sized particle of plutonium isn't terribly dangerous. "http://oud.nvmp.org/pluto4.htmPlutonium is toxic as a result of its radioactivity: not outside the body, but very much so inside the body. The smoke of burning plutonium contains microscopic plutonium particles, that may settle in the lungs where the "fire" seems to continue. Therefore, they are called: "hot particles", causing microscopic burns in the living tissues. At the edge of them lung cancer may develop. It was calculated that an amount of 27 micrograms of plutonium-dust is sufficient to cause lung cancer</comment>

<comment>Such scientific ignorance. News flash ! Meteorites are not made of plutonium and uranium</comment>

<comment>The whole solar system is made of things that generally exist on Earth. Almost everything burns up.</comment>

<comment>If memory serves me correctly 21 lbs of plutonium is the minimum amount needed for critical mass.</comment>

<comment>Which is far more than would survive burning up in atmosphere. </comment>

<comment>"Radioactive materials from meteorites burn up in the atmosphere all the time. ...?"I think the fundamentals of both physics and astrophysics completely elude you.</comment>

<comment>While a radioactive alpha emitter and a chemically toxic heavy metal, SDI wouldn't finely vaporize Pu-239 into dust, but cause heating in the core that would cause the explosive lenses of the warhead to prematurely detonate, that would scatter the core into chunks, not powder. The resulting fission yield would be rated in tons with little fallout.Most of this would have happened over the North Pole and upper Canada. Since Pu-239 is far heavier than Lead, bits wouldn't drift far.It's far better outcome than those cores detonating over US cities.</comment>

<comment>gee i feel so much betteralso i dont believe youstuff that falls from the upper atmosphere burns up on re-entrysure, it's better than nuclear detonation but 4000 MIRVs with multiple cores is going to be tons of the stuff and 'because Canada' really doesn't seem like an optimal outcomenot to mention that, er, SDI has never worked so we're back to 5,000,000 SPF and a really bad day</comment>

<comment>The problem with radiation is that there are A LOT of atoms in a chunk, some of which shave off and you have atomized particles all around the place. That's what made chernobyl so dangerous, despite the graphite chunks lying around.</comment>

<comment>Chernobyl was dangerous because the fuel rods had been in service long enough that they were rife with highly radioactive decay products.Warhead Cores have none of that</comment>

<comment>Cogent answer, nice.I might be wring, but I think Fukushima's total radio nuclei count is equivalent to a good number of nuclear warheads.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you understand how SDI would work... ballistic missile defense doesn't cause the nuclear weapon itself to explode.  It destroys it in a non-nuclear explosion.  You can destroy a nuclear weapon by explosion and not cause the nuclear reaction to occur (which is what produces most of the radiation).</comment>

<comment>except, SDI doesn't work. so much for imaginary thought experiments.</comment>

<comment>Well, SDI concepts have worked in low altitude defense settings in the form of less ambitious but still incredibly impressive projects like THAAD and Iron Dome.  To say that somehow the technology is impossible is ludicrous considering the fact that these projects have worked pretty well.  It just takes a long time to develop.</comment>

<comment>SDI as a defense against incoming MIRVs has never been feasible.It just takes a long time = it takes a buttload of money that would be better spent on more sensible things</comment>

<comment>It will take a long time and a ton of money.  But there is no more sensible thing I can think of then: "prevent another nation from being able to destroy American civilization as we know it within an hour".</comment>

<comment>I guess "don't build nukes in the 1st place" never occurred to anyone. and think of the cost savings.it will take a long time and a ton of money to pay the cost plus military contractors, but will still be defeatable by sheer numbers, or a MIRV in a shipping container connected to a GPS: game over...</comment>

<comment>Do you ever wonder if some of these people are in cahoots?</comment>

<comment>eliminating nuclear arsenals is idiotic</comment>

<comment>Why? What use are they other than as a deterrent to someone else using them against us?</comment>

<comment>there's that. there's also the fact there hasn't been a large scale world war since their inception and i'm not chalking that up to coincidence</comment>

<comment>We only had 2 "world wars" in all of history, and most of history did not have nuclear weapons.Personally I think we can't eliminate all nukes because we would still know how to make them, so better to keep a few in reserve as a deterrent. but if jihadis ever get one, our deterrent is useless.It is idiotic by the way, to continue to have enough of these to bounce all the rubble in Russia 10 times over. We should get the numbers down to a point where if they are ever used, the results will not include the end of the world. </comment>

<comment>dean, you said you were an ecologist. wouldn't just a handful of those bad boys render this planet uninhabitable? if so, then doesn't that make this kind of an all or nothing debate?</comment>

<comment>Depends on how big the handful, how distributed the detonations were, and which way the wind is lowing at the time. I'm no expert on radiation dilution.But generally no, a "handful" of large nuclear blasts would not end all human life or other life forms. Say we kept 5 and the Chinese, Russians, British, French, Israelis, Indians and Pakistanis (gulp) kept 5 each. I don't think all of them exploding on each others countries would be enough to wipe us out. I would, under that prospect, be sailing for Australia or maybe Tierra del Fuego.I do think 5 deliverable warheads would be a sufficient deterrent, except against jihadis.</comment>

<comment>i can jive with that. any room on that boat?</comment>

<comment>All I have is a single person ocean kayak. Its on the deck of my Seattle houseboat loaded and ready to go. I'm not looking forward to that long of a paddle.</comment>

<comment>Seattle houseboat?! damn Dean, i'm jealous!</comment>

<comment>Its only a rental while I have work up there. Cool place. Tiny but cool. My longer term (and weekend) home is a small farm in Oregon. Also cool but a lot of work to maintain.</comment>

<comment>sounds like you got it all figured my friend. maybe once the kids are off to college and i hang up the old stethoscope, the wife and i can do something similar</comment>

<comment>Sure, you can even rent the houseboat I am in. Its available 6 months of every year.</comment>

<comment>Actually we had global wars regularly from the Age of Discovery until 1945. Conflicts like the Seven Year's War and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars covered parts of the planet left in peace during WWI or WWII. </comment>

<comment>How does this detract away from Damascus's point?</comment>

<comment>His claim is we only had two World Wars. That's completely wrong. They were actually more common before the 20th century. </comment>

<comment>You still didn't answer the question: how does this minor quibble have to do with his point about Nuclear weapons?</comment>

<comment>He's claiming MAD hasn't helped keep world peace since 1945 by claiming we've only had two global wars. That's completely wrong. </comment>

<comment>Wrong based off of your very personal and subjective definition on what a global war is?</comment>

<comment>It's not personal. It's a basic point accepted by historians for the better part of a century. Just go on Amazon and search Seven Year's War or French and Indian War and see how many titles there are along the lines of First Global War, First World War, etc. Up until 1914 The Great War was the term used to describe the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. </comment>

<comment>I'm not sure which "historians" you're referring to because the ones I'm aware of don't really consider the wars pre-20th century truly global.Still not sure what this has to do with Nuclear weapons or Reagan for that matter.</comment>

<comment>Who have you been reading? It's a well accepted concept.http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/...http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/...</comment>

<comment>5th time now i'm now asking, what does this have to do with nuclear weapons and Reagan? Or that you don't really have one other than arguing for arguings sake?</comment>

<comment>I answered that three posts ago. Damascus claimed MAD hasn't influenced the lack of world wars because they were rare or nonexistent before nukes. That is not the case. World wars not only existed but were more common.</comment>

<comment>Which I said a few posts back that it seems to be more based off of your subjective interpretation (and your biases) of it, than any established fact. For ever historian that you can dig up that agrees with you, I can find as many that agrees with Damascus. The fact is, it's debatable and certainly not set in stone and established. But that's besides the point.In regards to his point, he's exactly right. Changing and evolving human attitudes --unilateral war and annexing countries is considered passé these days, the financial cost of war, globalization and free market capitalism, have done more to deter global war than nukes has ever done. The Soviet Union collapsed because it went broke. The Chinese and Europeans would rather compete and expand economically than militarily. We, as well as the Russians and Chinese have been reducing our arsenals since the Cold War, but yet conflict continues to decline. </comment>

<comment>And these "historians" are where? History is my major. Those are good points but it wasn't economics but the apocalypse that kept Cuba or Berlin making the Cold War go hot. It was nukes that kept another Indo-Pak War breaking out after the Mumbai attacks.</comment>

<comment>It's economics that's making Cuba broke and making it reconsider and soften its position on Communism. Same for the Chinese and the Soviet Union/Russia for matter as far as both of those countries ditching Communism altogether. Not nukes or MAD.Speaking of China, notice their big military buildup over the last few years doesn't involve or advertise more nuclear weapons?</comment>

<comment>Look up the Cuban Missile Crisis, the various Berlin Crises, Budapest in '56, Prague Spring or the Pueblo Incident. It wasn't economics that stopped one of those becoming the Sarajevo of WWIII. </comment>

<comment>God, are you literate, MM? He responded to that several posts above,</comment>

<comment>Will is quite right about global wars preceding the 20th Century.</comment>

<comment>Not really global. It took a big advance in technology to take wars global.</comment>

<comment>Read up on the Seven Year's War. You have major campaigns on land from India to Ohio. From Cape Town to Stettin. I don't how that doesn't count as global. </comment>

<comment>It was "global" in the sense of colonial powers fighting wherever they bumped into each other.  But it wasn't global in terms of ground or air campaigns all across the planet. Nor was WW1 or 2 for that matter. South America stayed out of both.</comment>

<comment>And that's different from WWI or WWII how? By your standards there's no such thing as a world war.</comment>

<comment>Its different in that there were no ground armies fighting outside of Europe. And no air campaigns of course. A small part of the globe was fighting, 99% of it was at peace. In WW1, the fighting extended to parts of Africa and shipping lanes in the Atlantic. In WW2 it extended to Asia and the Pacific. None of them, as you seem to recognize, were truly "world" wars. Its a Euro-centric concept.</comment>

<comment>There were major land battles outside of Europe in the pre-20th century global wars.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...Claiming WWI was only Europe and the ocean with a sideshow in Africa is absurd.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...For WWII Eurasia and North Africa is most of the world's land surface and it's not like North and South America weren't involved they just weren't fought on.Claiming the idea of global war is "Eurocentric" is laughable.</comment>

<comment>So are you now claiming the 7 years war was a "world" war? Or are you just trying to say there were land battles outside of Europe as part of the spillover of some European wars?No battles were fought in South America, and as far as I know only one South American nation sent troops to fight in WW2.</comment>

<comment>I've been saying it was a world war since my first post to you. The most decisive fighting in the 18th century wars is outside Europe. Mexico and Brazil sent troops into WWII. </comment>

<comment>Yes, Mexico joined the effort towards the end. They were trying to build some credit. Still................not much.I can't buy 7 years war as a "world" war, though you have made a good case. We will just have to disagree.</comment>

<comment>What!?  There were massive ground armies fighting outside Europe during the seven year's war!  India and North America stand out especially.</comment>

<comment>There were theatres of war globally. The technology was different, but that matters little.</comment>

<comment>Conflicts based on the ground with lines of defense is quite different than Mutually Assured Destruction.  The Nuclear age introduced the long-range, multiple targeting warhead."Regularity" would never happen again once that launch order was given.</comment>

<comment>"We should get the numbers down to a point where if they are ever used, the results will not include the end of the world."one MIRV with 18 warheads is pretty much going to waste the planet. talk about climate change...</comment>

<comment>That's why I'd like to get us down to around 5 each.</comment>

<comment>no, many far larger warheads were tested in the 50-60s.Thousands of cities were burned in WWII, world didn't end.Tokyo was hit worse than Nagasaki.MIRVs a fraction ofwhat a volcanic eruption would do, they aren't the old multi-megaton city killers of the early '60s.They are kiloton sized.</comment>

<comment>Not quite.  Look at the sheer number of nuclear tests in the "atomic age", and somehow our planet is still here.  Don't get me wrong, a nuclear war would be the greatest disaster in human history, but it's not quite as extreme as popular conception would have you believe.</comment>

<comment>its MORE extreme...It's Cormac McCarthy's "The Road" extreme.</comment>

<comment>In the span of history 60 years is a blink of an eye. Do you forsee nuclear arsenals on standby for 200 , or 1000, or 2000 years with out an accident or an nuclear armed nation having a cultural/political/societal nervous  breakdown along the lines of Germany in the 30's or France in the 1800's? If we were an intelligent species we would figure out how to make them, and NOT make them. Alas we are a stupid species.</comment>

<comment>No country in the world needs nuclear weapons.</comment>

<comment>shhh. the adults are talking</comment>

<comment>You are a complete and utter blithering moron.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>says the guy who only posts insult after insult on here</comment>

<comment>When someone resorts to insults, innuendo, smear, name calling etc,  you and they know they  have lost the debate.</comment>

<comment>Having them is even more idiotic.</comment>

<comment>this has been debated by much wiser than you or I. truly the answer is still up in the air</comment>

<comment>M.A.D. did work. Both US and USSR were sane enough not to start WWIII, since there was no winning it after 1965 by either side.</comment>

<comment>I'm old enough to remember "better dead than red." The notion, widely accepted at the time, was they we were all....every many woman and child...the entire future of the human race and most other life forms, better to be sacrificed than for us to have to live under communism.Think about that for a moment. Doesn't it seem utterly idiotic now that we know communism was nothing more than a passing phase that died of its own weight?</comment>

<comment>Easy to see that in hindsight.Not so easy in 1980.I never would have guessed that in a decade, that the USSR would fold and let the Warsaw Pact dissolve peacefully.</comment>

<comment>Nobody guessed it. We were all ready to sacrifice the human race for a mistake. Doesn't that make you feel weird?</comment>

<comment>Other than the remarkable Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who saw nearly every issue with clear eyes.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It worked? Well....we didn't all die in a firestorm. But it could have "worked" with far fewer warheads.</comment>

<comment>When it comes to planetary survival and risk, we ought to use our complete brains instead of just our fear reflex.</comment>

<comment>One would think, but rationality serves the emotions, not the other way around.</comment>

<comment>There is a Buddhist lesson right there.</comment>

<comment>I was aware of the the Republics, and how they had cultural and  historical difference with Russia, but never suspected they would all go their own way after the CCCP fell in 1989.</comment>

<comment>Everything is 20/20 in hindsight. It definitely didn't look that way in 1979, especially in the Third World. (Jimmy Carter-"I learned more about the Russians in a few weeks in December of 1979 than I did in my whole life before".) But indeed-while Washington was suffering from a temporary lack of self-confidence, Moscow was in economic denial. The costs of funding their offensive in the Third World were part of what doomed them. And Moscow also overplayed their hand: what happened in Poland and Afghanistan worked against them as responsible liberals turned against them again.Though after reading the Mitrokhin Archives, I can positively say that whatever the American government thought about the lives of their children, certain figures in the Soviet regime definitely wouldn't have cared about theirs for the sake of the world revolution. And these figures were quite ready to prepare for the apocalypse. Andropov was literally convinced in 1983 that the USA was preparing for preemptive nuclear war, no matter what the GRU and KGB found, and had them work overtime to produce proof in Operation RYAN. Reagan recalled in his diaries that in his first couple of years in office, he thought that it was taken for granted that nobody would contemplate such a thing. We were very lucky that he and Ustinov died.Other things that nobody would have predicted would have been the relatively peaceful explosion of democracies throughout the Third World in the 1980s and 1990s. My parents still recall how nobody would have ever dreamed in 1984 that apartheid would collapse peacefully in South Africa, for example. </comment>

<comment>My point....we were ready to sacrifice the entire future of the planet on a mistaken assumption about the longevity of communism as a system. That is not some minor mistake in hindsight. It was a pathologically insane position.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't pathologically insane.  Communism dominated half the globe for several decades.</comment>

<comment>Impermanence is pretty much an ignored reality.</comment>

<comment>Actually, "better red than dead" was the first and more popular slogan. The other was never as popular, and it was never a guiding ethos for the west in the Cold War.</comment>

<comment>St. Reagan only wanted his OWN armaments stored, secret, safe & salable to whomever he designated as worthy.  LOL.</comment>

<comment>The world would be a better place if no one owned nuclear weapons. No nuclear weapons. No threat. Just imagine that. World peace at last.</comment>

<comment>because prior to 1945 and the invention of nukes the world had lived in peace for 12 thousand years!!!</comment>

<comment>I'd take conventional warfare with less capable weapons anytime. In fact, the human species would be far more likely so survive another 100 or 1000 year if we were limited to paleolithic grade weapons. Spears and slings and such.We are a warring species, therefore we need to have the least lethal weapons with which to go about our inevitable warrior ways. Sooner or later if nukes continue to exist, they will be used. We humans can't help it. We are as my christian friends say, fallen creatures.</comment>

<comment>What explains Reagan’s remarkable transformation from Cold War hawk to nuclear peacemaker?Same way in that only Nixon could go to China</comment>

<comment>I see President Reagan as a grave digger of the Soviet Union and the spade that he used to prepare this grave was SDI, a Strategic Defense Initiative, so-called ``Star Wars.'' The trick was that the Soviet leadership believed that this SDI defense is possible and then--because it's possible, we must catch up with the Americans. And this was an invitation to the arms race, and the Soviet economy could not really afford it and this way Reagan really contributed to the demise of the Soviet Union.-- Gennady Gerasimov, final spokesman of the Soviet Foreign Ministry</comment>

<comment>So they collapsed because they could not keep up with an arms race even though they had already kept up the previous 35 years? And a race to a defense system that was nothing more than a concept? And that still doesn't work?I don't think so. Gorby came in and changed the equation, and Reagan was smart enough to take advantage of this.</comment>

<comment>What had changed by 1986 is that the system was collapsing internally. The economics were catastrophic. Gerasimov spoke the truth.</comment>

<comment>And also Gorby was a special leader, not drunk and not dying, and with an eye to the future of the Soviet Union.Both things are true.</comment>

<comment>I don't go that far. Gorbachov was always a  lot more popular in the West than he was in the East. I believe he was trying his best to get the genie back in the bottle, and it wasn't possible.</comment>

<comment>withholding for what?</comment>

<comment>Well, the Soviet economy completely collapsing meant that they could no longer afford to keep up.  Say what you want about the "burden" of US defense spending (currently about 2% of GDP), but it was nothing compared to the 14-16% of GDP that the USSR spent on defense through most of the cold war.  That was unsustainable, particularly when you consider the Soviet Union's poorly designed economic system.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately Regans cold war victory is pretty hollow now, Obama / Clinton have reset that relationship back to 1962 and the threat of nuclear annihilation is higher than it ever was under Regan...</comment>

<comment>Putin ain't Gorby, if that's what you're sayin'.At least Cheney is not visiting the Eastern European countries and hurling insults and threats to Russia about a new missile deployment in Poland. </comment>

<comment>Much of Gorbachev's interest in 1986 in a complete end to the arms race had to do with the prosaic fact that the Soviet Union could no longer afford it.Attibuting even a microspect of idealism to the Soviets is a big mistake.</comment>

<comment>Reagan's "nuclear abolitionism" had nothing to do with pacifism. He just believed that US with its superior scientific and industrial might would easily destroy USSR in a conventional war. He just wanted to make that planned destruction safe of nuclear retaliation by the Soviets.</comment>

<comment>When you ask yourself what was really going on with Reagan's thinking related to disarmament you have to keep in mind the kind of person Reagan was.  Let us not forget that Reagan was chief exploiter of the "Southern Strategy" first developed by Goldwater and then Nixon to gain power.  Reagan was willing to exploit the most immoral and reprehensible period in American history to pander to the hate and bigotry in the South in order to win office.I do not believe he cared one bit about disarmament or what it might mean for peace in the world.  It was always about gaining some advantage regardless of consequences, and nothing he ever wrote or said was anything more then him writing a script that he knew would be public.  There was no difference between Reagan the Actor and Reagan the Politician.  Both were all about putting on a show.</comment>

<comment>Iran-Contra. Oops/</comment>

<comment>1982-1990 the US DoD budget doubled from $200b to $400b. Anything about disarmament or nukes is just quibbling. </comment>

That endeavor would be illegal under the Biological Weapons Convention—which bans the development, production and stockpiling of biological weapons—but not unprecedented. The former Soviet Union, which was a party to the BWC, repeatedly thumbed its nose at the organization.

<comment>Wile E. Coyote writing about roadrunner.</comment>

<comment>The author strives to blame Reagan's"obsession" with SDI for the reason the world isn't nuclear free today. Gorbachev's offer to reduce nuclear weapons to zero in exchange for a U.S. commitment to abandon the weaponization of space was a ruse, and one that Reagan was too smart to fall for. Nuclear weapons, especially at the tactical level, were critical in offsetting the shear size of Warsaw Pact forces in Europe. Without them, there was no way NATO could have defended against an invasion through the Fulda Gap. And strategic nukes were a hedge in case a tactical nuclear exchange escalated out of control.Stupid liberal writers.</comment>

<comment>We STILL OWE national debt for the Reagan military buildup and the SDI money hole.</comment>

<comment>It's pennies on the dollar compared to the debt that this country has built up since the 2008 election. Besides, that military build up defeated communism (something liberals hate, I know), kept Iran in check (until 2008, of course), blew Sadaam Hussein away in the early 90's, rocked Al Qeada's world, and handed the Iraqi people a safe and relatively peaceful country (until 2008, of course). It was well worth it.</comment>

<comment>Time value of money.Debt multiplies as interestWe compound our historical borrowing exponentially,Sorry you can't pin it on Hoover,</comment>

<comment>Are you just as derisive of the debt FDR left us? Both faced foes intent on the west's subservience to their whims. One of them was able to win the battle without a major loss of life. Shouldn't that be celebrated?</comment>

<comment>SDI was the biggest taxpayer boondoggle to ever go down the pipe of the American pocket book.  It was an utter failure in every way and unbelievably costly.  Reagan was guilty of many things, including heading up the most indicted and convicted administration in American history, sending guns to our sworn enemy to fund arming terrorists in Central America, beginning an age of government sponsored scientific ignorance, foisting an economic program on the United States, whose ultimate voodoo led the largest transfer of wealth from the working class to the uber wealthy in human history, and part of all his grandiose fubars was SDI, an indefensible program that never worked to begin with and cost the American taxpayers billions over the course of years.  Anyone defending SDI should be required to foot that goddam bill for the rest of us.  The lie that Ronald Reagan was anything more than a pompadour dyed black and full of blarney is one of the most pernicious myths of American politics, and still, he looks very much what the right of America today blithely calls RINOism.</comment>

<comment>It is useful to notice that Weisberg [ a staunch Obamabot who scribbles for the liberal SLATE ], would rather live in the past than face the present due to the current folly bearing on such issues as nuclear weapons that is in the direct lap of Obama, and not ''Reagan''.                 Obama has struck out on a series of fast balls delivered by the North Koreans, Iran [ which ignored Obamas feeble sanctions threats and went ahead with ICBM testing along with the NKs who used a sat launch as a fig leaf for their own ICBM tests ], Pakistan [ which just rebuffed Obamas plea to limit tactical nuclear weapons ], and Russia [ whose Putin just declared the US, their nations ''worst enemy'', vindicating the Mitt Romney of 2012 and making a fool out of the Hillary Clinton of the same year ].Thus it is no accident that now, and not ''1986'', sees a US more worried over nuclear conflict than at any other time since the end of the Cold War.There, liberals, is your ''post-racial era of hope and change''...............Courtesy of the guy taking a mulligan on the 8th Hole....................http://www.independent.co.uk/n...http://indianexpress.com/artic...http://www.bbc.com/news/world-...</comment>

<comment>Hi, Cap't Sir! Agree with your comments here, most especially about Putin: the Atlantic article:http://www.theatlantic.com/int...Everybody think Putin's such a right guy or a bafoon and not how dangerous he and his forays in the ME actually are.  (my comments to up votes went way down after my arguing with those guys). Anyway, check out that article and Happy New Year!</comment>

<comment>Thanks Win. The influence of Russia will be even made more manifest by the fact that Obama has painted himself into a trap between Iran and Saudi Arabia, who are now within an ace of open conflict with Lavrov sent by Putin to mediate this new mess. They, and not Obama, hold the trump card which only weakens US credibility this much more.</comment>

<comment>Nuclear disarmament is a goal that we should all dream of, but never actually attempt.  Nuclear weapons and the knowledge to produce them has spread to so many state and non-state actors that unilateral disarmament by the US, or even multilateral disarmament by the US and its allies would be a serious strategic error.  It is hard to imagine China, North Korea, Russia, Pakistan (and by consequence, India) giving up their nuclear weapons even if the US "coalition" did.The other thing to consider is the fact that the threat of mutually assured destruction has not only prevented nuclear war, but large scale conventional war between the world's most powerful nations since 1945.  Watching the news, it is easy to forget that we are currently living in one of the most peaceful eras in history.  In the 30 years prior to the invention of the A-Bomb, the world experienced two brutal world wars that together killed over 100 million people.  While globalization and the spread of democracy plays a role in conflict de-escalation, do we really want to test that theory by removing the greatest deterrent to large scale conventional conflict?  Combining the large scale inter-state warfare of the pre-nuclear era with 21st century technology is a recipe for disaster.</comment>

<comment>"Jacob Weisberg blames Reagan’s support for 'his cherished fantasy' of SDI forthe failure of the US and the USSR to eliminate nuclear weapons at the 1986Reykjavik, Iceland summit. Weisberg also claims in his January 1, 2016 essaythat reductions in nuclear weapons which Reagan pursued were incompatible withmodernizing these very weapons. Weisberg then claims Reagan was transformedfrom a Cold War hawk to nuclear peacemaker. All such claims are incorrect.“Former President Reagan was careful to clearly identify that the primary goal was to first reduce nuclear dangers. That is why he insisted that we keep missile defense and not place such work only in a laboratory which the USSR demanded. Reagan coupled nuclear weapons reductions with nuclear modernization because the two went together as history has shown. The strategy worked.In Iceland with Mr. Gorbachev, nuclear bombers were eventually not part of the package of reductions and neither were all the tactical nuclear weapons both the United States and the FSU had on hand. More importantly, the reductions proposed by and achieved by the past 5 Presidents owe the success to Reagan as he proposed in 1981 and 1982 the elimination of all INF nuclear missiles (achieved) andreducing nuclear weapons on ballistic missiles by nearly 50% (also achieved inthe START I, Moscow and New Start treaties), respectively.However, the arms control community opposed the proposed reductions, with the New York Times calling Reagan's INF and START proposals designed to “end armscontrol” and “assure the Soviets would not agree to any deal”. Reagan pushedfor reductions as early the 1970's when he opposed the SALT treaties as nothingmore than agreements to codify the buildup of nuclear arsenals. The nuclearfreeze was pushed by the Soviets and the entire so-called arms controlcommunity in the USA which would have locked into place Soviet nuclearadvantages at that time and grave nuclear instabilities. Reagan pushed forreductions but also simultaneous modernization of the remaining force.Organizations today such as Global Zero have opposed most of the modernization  now and have gone so far as to support the Sanders/ Markey legislation of keeping only 8 of the 12 planned submarines but eliminating all ICBMs and taking the bombers out of the nuclear business.The result would be a handful of nuclear assets that the Soviets could completely target especially if the oceans become transparent as the land and sea now are. Having so few submarines also would compel the USA to have only a one ocean submarine deterrent thus making it impossible to cover targets in both Russia and China necessary to deter both nations now nuclear armed and hostile to the United States.Endorsing zero strategic nuclear weapons and particularly ballistic missiles was a Reagan goal but as he said after the Iceland summit with Gorbachev such a goal could not result in America taking risks or not defending herself and that included missile defense and a strong nuclear deterrent.Whether candidates for office know or understand these details is important but the difficulty of getting such understanding is made interminably worse by both a media and an analytical community unaware apparently of the history of arms control and especially President Reagan's push for significantly reducing nuclear dangers. A newbook by my colleague Sven Kraemer, "Inside the Cold War; From Marx toReagan", details as no other published material has done previously,the exact nature of President Reagan's push for reducing nuclear dangers. Iworked with Mr. Kraemer and other senior Reagan administration officials inpublic diplomacy efforts to secure both arms reductions and nuclearmodernization, both of which were critical to a more stable and safe world. Thearms control groups in 1981 under the banner of SANEFREEZE opposed everythingReagan proposed to strengthen our countries nuclear deterrent while adoptingwholesale the Soviet freeze ideas. Currently there is a consensus betweenCongress and the administration to move forward on completing the critical jobof fully modernizing the nuclear enterprise, reducing nuclear dangers,improving strategic stability, and reassuring our allies that the United Statesis fully committed to maintaining and improving nuclear deterrence. Fantasiesabout going soon to global zero are just that--fantasies. Reagan did not sharesuch simple beliefs as he understood there was nothing more important thansecuring the safety of the American people first.”</comment>
