<comment>You guys realize taking big money out of politics benefits people like me, right? "Global citizens" like (((Soros))) and traitors like the Koch guys can rot in hell.</comment>

<comment>It still catches me off guard that anyone could think this line of rationalization by Roberts & Co. is a good thing. Its essentially arguing that the more money you have the more your voice should matter in politics. That is the antithesis of democracy.</comment>

<comment>But it is in keeping with history isn't it? After all, the vote initially only went to landowners. Perhaps this is way to bring those conservative origins back.Which isn't to say I agree with it, but is to say that it has precedent and solid historical grounding.</comment>

<comment>So we should keep doing things the way we've always done things? Tell that to the Africans freed by emancipation.</comment>

<comment>It is in keeping with the idea of a Republic.  At it's heart a Republic is government by the elite of the society.</comment>

<comment>No, it's not.</comment>

<comment>Well what would you consider voting not on issues, but on representatives?  Who are those representatives?  The dregs of society?</comment>

<comment>It used to catch me off guard that people support censorship of pay-per-view movies critical of political candidates, but I've read enough of this drek that it no longer surprises me.</comment>

<comment>My guess is you neither have money nor donate to political campaigns with any significance, and yet, the implication of your comment is that you agree that other people (not yourself) should have more influence in how our country is governed. Brava, the conservative movement embodied.</comment>

<comment>To progressives, the US Constitution has always been an obstacle.  Things like voting and free speech are impediments to implementing a radical left wing agenda. The progressives therefore decided it would be a great idea to chisel away at it by curtailing our First Amendment rights.  The SCOTUS then restored our rights via the ruling in Citizens United.</comment>

<comment>They don't want a "Eugene McCarthy" upstart to ever be able to come in and topple their chosen candidate ever again like happened to LBJ. Citizen United makes that more of a possibility.</comment>

<comment>Another article, allowed by our free speech right, criticizing the Supreme Court for upholding free speech.  </comment>

<comment>From Merriam Webster:"Full Definition of speech1a :  the communication or expression of thoughts in spoken words :  exchange of spoken words :  conversation2a :  something that is spoken :  utterance :  a usually public discourse :  address3a :  language, dialect :  an individual manner or style of speaking4:  the power of expressing or communicating thoughts by speaking"I don't see "donating money" anywhere in that definition. Do you?</comment>

<comment>Donations are less speech-ish, but thats not the issue.  The issue is expenditures on speech.Would a law banning spending money to produce and distribute a daily news show be a law restricting speech?</comment>

<comment>"Donations are less speech-ish, but thats not the issue. The issue is expenditures on speech."Go read McCutcheon, discussed in the article above, which holds that donations to politicians cannot be restricted except in cases of quid pro quo bribery. Direct donations to political campaigns are very much "the issue."</comment>

<comment>You don't know the law. Go read Buckley v. Valeo and pay attention to the holding regarding individual contributions.</comment>

<comment>You might want to read McCutcheon, yourself.  Donations to any  particular candidate can be restricted, and are under existing law.McCutcheon was on a person's aggregate expenditures -- i.e., can he donate the max to Senate candidate A, plus House candidates B and C, plus President candidate D.  It didn't uproot the individual expenditure limits.</comment>

<comment>No, I don't.The expression of speech can be expensive.  Look at what unions, which are corporations spend on politics.Webster's definition doesn't matter, because he's not on the Supreme Court, who is deciding the matter.But, to take your argument forward, I don't see flag burning or pornography in Noah's definition either, but the court has ruled that those are protected under the first amendment.</comment>

<comment>Does the freedom of the press only apply the printing press?</comment>

<comment>There is no way to "get big money out of politics" without massive censorship of the media.  What do you think a bigger expenditure is -- a campaign ad, or an hour-long news/opinion show?Anything else is just channeling the flow in one direction or another, not stopping it.  Channeling to the two major parties and/or to media corporations instead of third-party campaigns and organizations, but the incentive to spend is still there.Show of hands -- who's up for massive censorship of the traditional media?  Anyone?  Buehler?  Other than a few really left-wing but intellectually honest, law profs, no one would even consider it.  As far as I know, no one even *tracks* what the media spends on its own political speech.So where does that leave expenditure restrictions?  As an incumbent and traditional-media protection device.  Let them monopolize political speech, and keep it out of the hands of grubby outsiders with their no-good, populist messaging.</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court should not distinguish between corporate and union political spending in any way. If one gets regulated the other should face identical regulations.</comment>

<comment>News media too.  All news would have to be of neutral point of view or else the cost of the message would be considered a donation and fines should be levied.</comment>

<comment>Counter-point: What if big money has a moderating influence on political practice? While the various "big money" interests may have conflicting interests, they're still primarily interested in seeing things work, not endless gridlock. Extremism and polarization are bad for business, and more the domain of party activists intent on achieving ideological ends.If outside money is banned and are all forced to use roughly the same amount of money, then winning the election becomes a matter of drumming up "free" coverage from the media. This in turn means the most likely candidates will either be those of the establishment who can control the bully-pulpit by virtue of their reputation, a la HRC, or bombastic populists who are so outrageous that they dominate media coverage, a la DJT. There is very little space left over for challengers who are possibly better governors, but aren't as appealing to mass media, like Jeb or Rand Paul or Walker.Similarly, the ending of earmarks in Congress was supposed to reduce corruption and make for a cleaner, more efficient budge, but in reality made it more difficult for the leadership to keep the members in order, with the end result being a decrease in output and an increasing tendency towards gridlock.</comment>

<comment>The US Constitution protects Free Speech while the article is in essence advocating for Equal Speech.</comment>

<comment>There's little evidence that money matters that much in elections, anyways. Meg Whitman spent almost 200 million of her personal fortune in a failed bid for California's gubernatorial seat, outspending Governor Brown 6 to 1. Eric Cantor got primaried by a dude who was outspent 50 to 1. Jeb Bush and his super PAC have the biggest warchest and he's polling in the low single digits.It might matter in a close election, but even then, the only thing that counts is who has the votes. And you can't (directly) buy votes.</comment>

<comment>How is the big money working out for Jeb?</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Look at how many times Bloomberg, Brady Bunch, etc have poured money onto a gun control candidate only to see them lose in a landslide to someone with far less money.</comment>

<comment>Oh my yes the next president (it they have 8 years) could replace: Breyer, RBG, Kennedy, Scalia, and Thomas.  All of them are old and likely nearing the end of their terms.</comment>

<comment>For the last 10 years, the Supreme Court has engaged in a systematic effort to transform American democracy===============This is BS, the courts rule on law.</comment>

<comment>There is only one way to reduce "corruption" (influence of money) in government.Make government smaller.The reason that big money tries to influence government is because government is so damn big and has its fingers in every aspect of our lives. Reduce the federal government to national defense and running the money supply, and people will stop spending huge money trying to influence elections.</comment>

<comment>It seems most people in the country are sick of big money in politics. Big corporations buying their way into how the country is run is a disgrace. SCOTUS decision on allowing Citizens United to have at it was a big mistake. Democrats get big donations as well but the Citizens United decision was made to benefit one party alone that being the Republican Party.</comment>

<comment>If it was just Soros, Bloomberg and unions pumping in money we wouldn't hear any conplaints on the Atlantic.</comment>
