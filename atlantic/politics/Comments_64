<comment>No one deserves a vacation more than President Obama. Of course as POTUS he never gets a real vacation as he's on the job 24/7 wherever he is. He's achieved a lot considering the non compliance from Congress on most fronts during the year. As for keeping us safe he's done a good job and will continue to do so. I have to laugh when Republicans keep talking about keeping the country safe, especially Jeb Bush. He apparently has forgotten that 911 happened on his brothers watch! Hope the President and the his family enjoy their Christmas break they deserve it just like any other family in the country.</comment>

<comment>When is Obama NOT on vacation, golfing and spending time with his Hollywood friends?</comment>

<comment>Ummmmm.. most of the time?</comment>

<comment>What color is the sky in your world?</comment>

<comment>IQ below 90?</comment>

<comment>Oh what short memories some have.  President George W. Bush spent more time down in Crawford Texas than he did at the White House. President Obama apparently is expected to stay tied to his desk at the White House! God forbid he be afforded the same vacation time & respect of other Presidents.</comment>

<comment>Guess what?   It takes a lot more time to fly from DC to Hawaii than it would to Texas which on is on the U.S. mainland.    Obama has wasted millions of tax-dollars on these very expensive vacations he chooses to take from himself.   The guy uses tax dollars for a separate plane to fly his dog ad Michelle uses a separate plane sometimes.   That's a lot more $$$ wasted.   People are sick of the waste and Donald J. Trump is going to put an end to it.</comment>

<comment>So you would prefer it if President Obama had his vacation in Texas because it's closer in flying time!! Sarcasm intended! It's irrelevant where President Obama takes his vacation and certainly nobody's business come to that.  Your idea of Texas being closer than Hawaii has nothing to do with anything! His job doesn't stop because he's on vacation he's on the job 24/7! So let's get real.</comment>

<comment>Really? Donald Trump is going to put an end to "the waste"?  Have you seen any of his resorts?</comment>

<comment>He's turned out to be a pretty effective President, in retrospect, especially considering the historic levels of political resistance he's had to tangle with for most of his tenure. I'm not always happy with the decisions he makes, but I think he's been a good leader, all things considered, and anyway there's no denying now that he knows how to get things done in just about any political climate.</comment>

<comment>It took him a while – he was stuck on that "consensus' thing for far too long and (apparently) didn't appreciate just how much bigoted hate there was (is) on th right.</comment>

<comment>Yes he's been a good president for ISIS, Iran, Russia, etc.</comment>

<comment>Oh, more fap from you? You done yet?</comment>

<comment>Just pointing out the facts.  Obama provided ISIS with the opportunity to expand and kill.   Obama is giving Iran billions to buy weapons and to proceed with their nuclear weapons program.   Obama has emboldened Russia along with China.</comment>

<comment>"Just pointing out the facts"No. You are just publicly fapping and showing your arse.Have some pride – don't parade your ignorance.</comment>

<comment>Bush/Cheney removed Saddam, allowing ISIS to form and fill in the vacuum left by his removal, while utilizing some of Saddam's ex military. From Frontline 10/28/2014: "As the Islamic State continues its march through Syria and Iraq, the jihadist group is quietly utilizing a network of former members of Saddam Hussein’s Baath Party to help militarize a fighting force that has effectively erased the border between both nations and left roughly 6 million people under its rule.The extent of this seemingly mismatched alliance is detailed in a new report by the New York-based intelligence firm, The Soufan Group. Despite a deep philosophical divide between ISIS and the Baath Party, the two sides have found “sufficient coincidence of interest to overcome any ideological disagreement,” the analysis, which will be released on Wednesday, found.This “marriage of convenience,” as the report’s author, Richard Barrett describes it, can be seen throughout the ISIS hierarchy. The current head of the group’s military council, for example, is believed to be Abu Ahmad al Alwani, an ex-member of Saddam Hussein’s army. So too was al Alwani’s predecessor. Another member of the military council, Abu Muhanad al Sweidawi, was once a lieutenant colonel in Hussein’s air defense intelligence, but by early 2014 was heading ISIS operations in western Syria, according to the report.Similarly, two deputies to the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliph, Abu Bakr al Baghdadi, are former Baathists: Abu Muslim al Afari al Turkmani is believed to have been a senior special forces officer and a member of military intelligence in Hussein’s army. Today, as Baghdadi’s number two, he supervises ISIS operations in Iraq. The second deputy, Abu Ali al Anbari oversees operations in Syria. Both men are also thought to serve on the Islamic State’s main governing body, known as the Shura Council.Even the appointment of al Baghdadi to lead the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010 is reported by an ISIS defector to have been engineered by a former Baathist: Haji Bakr, an ex-colonel from the Iraqi Revolutionary Guard. Bakr “initially attracted criticism from fellow members of the group for his lack of a proper beard and lax observance of other dictates of their religious practice,” the report notes, “But his organizational skills, knowledge of the Iraqi Army and network of fellow ex-Baathists made him a valuable resource.”</comment>

<comment>you are explaining dubbaya bush pretty well but this conversation is about obama.</comment>

<comment>Record levels of political resistance? He owned the first two years of both houses and could have passed anything. He didn't.Obama will be known for the worst post-recession economy since the Great Depression. He will be known for the worst period of foreign policy maybe ever. Show me one past President who has been criticized by all three former Secretaries of Defense and while he was still President.</comment>

<comment>Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>What about immigration or gun control or his climate garbage  -  all those things he loves blaming on having resistance. What happened those first two years other than Obamacare?</comment>

<comment>Saved GM</comment>

<comment>No he did not.It was Bush who signed to auto bailout. All Obama did was redistribute the bailout to the UAW and away from vendors who were supposed to get.Next?</comment>

<comment>Bush did nothing but kick the can down the line for the next President to deal with. If Bush had resolved the situation, Obama wouldn't have had to make tough choices.No, if Obama had listened to what conservatives like Romney, etc. were calling for.... We would have no GM today.</comment>

<comment>Want to know the definition of a liar is?  You, shortcakes."Bush did nothing but kick the can down the line for the next President to deal with"http://www.politico.com/story/...http://www.newyorker.com/news/...How many more lies you want to post here?</comment>

<comment>Before we continue ...Can you admit that just because we see things differently, we both are sincere our opposing views? I'm not sure why I should waste time with someone so reflexively inclined to accuse anyone you disagree with as a "liar".Also, did you read either article you shared?</comment>

<comment>See things different?If that what you call fabricating events?That is a lie.Bush did not kick the can down the road as you said. That is a fabrication of an event.I read the articles and you are a liar.</comment>

<comment>From your Politico article:In explaining his decision Friday, Bush said holding back "would leave the next president to confront the demise of a major American industry in his first days of office."Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>So?You said Bush kicked the can down the road. Does that article indicate he did? No.Can you read?Try actually reading both articles and comprehending them.</comment>

<comment>The articles describe Bush's temporary measure that Obama supported and conservatives did not.http://prospect.org/article/un...</comment>

<comment>Look, goober, let me make this simple.YOU claimed Obama saved GMThe bailout saved GMThe bailout was passed and signed in 2008 by BushAll Obama had to do was carry out what was passed - which he did not.A bailout, by definition is a temporary measure -  a loan which this was.It was intended to keep  GM from bankruptcy court. But Obama mismanaged the funds and GM and they still ended up in bankruptcy court making the bailout a waste of money.</comment>

<comment>http://www.politifact.com/trut..."The Bush Administration provided short-term bridge loans," Rubenstein said. "That allowed the Obama Administration to take a couple of months to assess the situation."</comment>

<comment>Still stupid and still have reading comprehension problems.One more time1. A bailout by definition is a short term financial fix or loan. Period.2. Obama inherited the terms of that and changed it to help the UAW which forced GM into bankruptcy court which was what the bailout was intended to avoid. So Obama failed the country but helped the leaders of the UAW and hurt vendors.3. PolitiFarce is exactly that. In 2013, PolitiFarce called the lies of the year in 2012 Obama's lies about Obamacare. By doing so PolitiFarce lost all credibility because of how many times they claimed those lies were the truth. Pick credible sources.Go find some other issue to pretend you know something about.</comment>

<comment>Blame the messenger. Ok.</comment>

<comment>Obama continued the Bush auto bailout. They both get credit for wasting American taxpayer funds on companies that needed to declare bankruptcy sooner rather than later. Romney was the one that changed the discussion...that is why he is the foremost expert in managed bankruptcies!</comment>

<comment>GM is alive and well today thanks to Obama (with help from Bush).Romney is done.</comment>

<comment>Look at this http://www.foxnews.com/story/2...MORT KONDRACKE, EXECUTIVE EDITOR, ROLL CALL: I do not think they are unfair conditions.What they require is that the wages and benefits of UAW workers be matched to those of foreign transplants that operate in the United States by the end of next year.So this is-and there has been this argument, does a UAW worker makes $75 an hour where as the transplants make only $48 an hour? No. So the difference between them that has to be adjusted is not that great. It's about $10 an hour that the UAW would have to take a haircut on.This is a marker that the unions are laying down to the Obama administration and to the Democratic Congress, because they, after all, are the ones that will have to carry this out. George Bush has basically kicked this can down the road into the Obama administration.And Gettelfinger is saying we do not like this. You save us from this requirement.</comment>

<comment>You are still insisting on being stupid.So stay that way and make a fool of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Too bad he didn't listen to Romney.</comment>

<comment>Because you'd have preferred to see the end of General Motors?Got it.</comment>

<comment>Yes. A criminal org.</comment>

<comment>More so than other big corporations?</comment>

<comment>Shut em all down, end subsidies, and break em up.Obama. Hillary. Corporate tools.Sanders 16.</comment>

<comment>Romney did that, Romney changed the discussion by advocating bankruptcy. Prior to Romney's column GM's CEO and Obama dismissed the idea of bankruptcy. </comment>

<comment>And this clearly evident truth sealed the deal to help Romney trounce Obama in 2012. Got it.</comment>

<comment>I remember when Romney advocated bankruptcy and he was roundly criticized and slowly people came to his position. The reason many people don't understand what happened is because Obama lied to the American people about Romney's position and the media was complicit in the obsfucation...that is how a billion dollars can impact the political process. </comment>

<comment>Who came to Romney's position?You might be confusing this with Romneycare aka Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>Obama and the GM CEO came to Romney's position with regard to the auto bankruptcies.  </comment>

<comment>So why did Romney take it all right on the chin while Obama gets credit?</comment>

<comment>$1 billion can buy a lot. </comment>

<comment>Seems Romney was one of the wealthier candidates.</comment>

<comment>Here's a partial list:  http://www.washingtonmonthly.c...</comment>

<comment>He passed quite a bit despite unprecedented amounts of filibustering, which looks even better in retrospect given Congress since then can barely keep the government open.Actually the worst post-recession economy was GW Bush. Obama has created 13.5 million jobs and reducing gas prices to 1.99 a gallon since the recession, whereas Bush only created 1 million jobs and increased Oil prices to 3.50 a gallon.</comment>

<comment>What about gun control or climate change or immigration? He had no resistance those first two years.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your questions.  Actually, he had a united Republican opposition and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate for less than half that session of Congress.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, Arlen Specter doesn't count as a Democrat.</comment>

<comment>?Agreed.  And for that reason (among others), President Obama had a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate for less than a year.</comment>

<comment>Obama didn't contend with a "united Republican opposition", Specter was a Republican when Obama was elected. </comment>

<comment>It's well documented the extent to which Senate Republicans united in opposition to virtually everything President Obama proposed...even when what he proposed was policies many of them had previously supported.  That unprecedented (in modern times) level of partisan obstructionism helped lead some centrist Republicans (e.g., Specter, Jim Jeffords, Colin Powell) to leave the party in a "I didn't leave the Republican party; the Republican party left me" kind of way.</comment>

<comment>Don't you understand that Bush didn't get 60 senate votes for his signature tax cut legislation and that the Democrats that did vote for it today would probably be Republicans? Heck, Bush didn't even get 60 votes for Medicare part D but it wasn't filibustered.  60 votes is difficult to get and Obama decided that he was going to pass a bill with 60 votes and compromise as little as possible. </comment>

<comment>Yes, I understand that Democrats in the early 2000s, for a variety of reasons, did not adopt a strategy of "massive resistance" to anything and everything President Bush proposed.  I also understand that President Obama initially hoped to get 65-80 votes for major initiatives like the Recovery Act and the Affordable Care Act.  And I understand that Senate Republicans in early 2009 adopted a strategy of "massive resistance", opposing policies and bills simply because Obama supported them.</comment>

<comment>The ACA received more votes in the Senate than the Bush Tax Cuts so your point fails. </comment>

<comment>Well, no, I don't think so.  It shows that Republicans filibustered the ACA even though it had a clear majority, while Democrats did not filibuster the Bush tax cuts, even though they could have.</comment>

<comment>Nope, the Bush Tax Cuts passed through reconciliation and they had a sunset provision...Obama extended 90% of the tax cuts which proves that Democrat opposition was not based on principles but politics.</comment>

<comment>And Democrats during the Bush administration did not use the filibuster nearly as often as Republicans did in the first two years of the Obama administration.</comment>

<comment>My point stands--Obama's signature legislation received more votes than Bush's and we know the Democrat standard-bearer supported 90% of it 9 years later. </comment>

<comment>Yes, despite the Senate Republican leadership's strategy of "massive resistance" to improving access to affordable health care for working-class citizens, the Affordable Care Act received more votes than the Bush 2001 tax cuts.</comment>

<comment>Obama supports 90% of the Bush Tax Cuts because they were mostly directed at the middle class. The next Republican president will modify the ACA much more than Obama modified the Bush Tax Cuts because the overall law is a total mess.  </comment>

<comment>Maybe!  After all, congressional Republicans made a strategic decision to oppose the ACA no matter what it looked like.  It wouldn't be at all surprising for the next Republican president with a Republican Congress to change it radically.</comment>

<comment>You are wrong, Obama decided to get as much as he could with his filibuster proof majority. </comment>

<comment>That's one way to look at it.  Another is that President Obama and the Senate Democrats figured out that nothing they did would result in winning Republican votes, so they made every compromise necessary to win all 60 Democratic votes.</comment>

<comment>Again, that's your opinion.  You may even be right.And once it became clear, after several months of negotiations led by Sen. Baucus, that Republicans like Sens. Collins, Snowe & Voinovich would not vote in favor of any version of the ACA, Baucus, Reid, Obama and the rest of the Democrats did decide to get whatever they could that Sens. Nelson, Lieberman, et al, would support.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your comment, but 1) the first two years of President Obama's administration saw, for better or worse,  the largest collection of progressive legislation enacted since the mid-1960; and 2) with congressional Republicans having adopted a strategy of "massive resistance" to anything and everything President Obama proposed, and with Democrats having 60 seats in the Senate for less than a year (and the Senate's anti-majoritarian rules), he didn't even "own" both houses of Congress for most of that time.</comment>

<comment>The economy is growing for the top 1% or so but the rest of America is not doing so well.  Wages are still stagnant for most Americans and vast majority of new jobs being created are low-paying or part-time.   Obama is the one decided to flee Iraq and provide and opportunity of ISIS and Iran to move in.   Thousands of foreigners continue to enter the U.S. at will every month and Obama does little to discourage it because he wants to change the demographics of the U.S. and create new Democrat voters.</comment>

<comment>He killed other socialists. A socialist is a socialistMussolini was a socialist. He created the fascist party. Mussolini said the fascist party incorporated all the ideals of the socialist party but was based on nationalism.Right wing beliefs is based on less and less government until you reach anarchy.Let wing beliefs are based on more and more government until you reach all forms of authoritarian government.Left wing academia since World War II desperately tried to distort this in order to distance the left from Hitler.</comment>

<comment>Hold on a sec, you think anarchism is the purest form of conservative ideology?</comment>

<comment>The complete lack of government is the most extreme of less and less an less government the same way authoritarianism is the most extreme of more and more government.</comment>

<comment>But anarchism as a political ideology is underpinned by direct democracy, syndicalism and the elimination of other 'oppressive' institutions at the same time as government (mainly capitalism and religion).I've occasionally heard an overenthusiastic libertarian describe themselves as an 'anarcho-capitalist' but for the most part anarchy is pretty well and uncontroversially entrenched as a fever dream of the extreme left.If you get to a 'complete lack of government' via the right, you pass through a number of ideologies that at best ignore and at worst support handing more agency to large institutions. In the past this included company towns, slavery (though slavery in America eventually became dependent on government support) and political powers for religious assemblies over their congregation. The real road to serfdom is continuing to enact 'conservative' laws that empower large stakeholders until the government's powers have essentially been devolved away to the best organized non-government units.This is all strictly theoretical ideological indulgence, of course; no modern government or lack thereof has survived long-term that's been further to the left than a permanent socialist dictatorship or further to the right than a Fascist government like Franco's, which was essentially an agreement between the military, large landowners and industrialists and the Church to let each other do what they wanted in their respective spheres and collaborate to suppress all dissent.</comment>

<comment>Wow, that's  the best you got?  You've never misspoke or made a typo?  Do you really think Obama ever thought there were 57 states?</comment>

<comment>Most people just don't care. And haven't for years. The GOP handed him two elections. But it's hard to show the majority of adults in the US have supported him since 2009. When he's gone, he will largely be forgotten. Gerry Ford with six more years. Frankly, it's doubtful any future President will make much more of a difference either. The US is going down, slowly but surely. The media needs the melodrama of "elections", but the real decision makers arent in DC.They are the ones who control the data and the networks, and the funds that transfer over those networks.</comment>

<comment>He won two elections.  It's an easy out to suggest that it was ONLY the Republican candidate/message that were at fault (sure they were part of it, but there's a record of people underestimating Obama and regretting it).  And given some of the decisions made in the administration before his, I'm not sure if I'd be so generous with the term 'adults' there.</comment>

<comment>*YAWN* You think W paid for his 72 trips to his ranch on AF1, at a cost of over $250,000 each, out of his own pocket?LMFAO!</comment>

<comment>What is more expensive and time consuming?A)  Flying from DC to Texas.B) Flying from DC to Hawaii.Let me know when you figure this out.</comment>

<comment>Flying from DC to Texas 72 TIMES, and spending THREE of his EIGHT years in office on vacation. Building a multi-million dollar building to house the 12 full time secret service required to keep the "ranch" secure and ready at all times, and flying support staff back and forth every one of those 72 TIMES. That does not include trips to the family compound in Maine, and family trips to africa including one for Laura and her two grown children.Obama has spent the least time on vacation of any modern president.Let me know when YOU figure it out.</comment>

<comment>You didn't answer the question.   Probably because you didn't want to acknowledge the answer which is B.And flying to Hawaii is a LOT more expensive.   There are additional costs (to taxpayers) for fuel and security.    And unlike President Bush who had working vacations, Obama will not be bring anyone from his cabinet to do work or to conduct business.   No, it will be just more playtime on the tax-payer's dime.</comment>

<comment>You are so silly! Every trip between DC and Texas cost more than $250,000, and he made 72 of them. It also cost tens of millions every year to keep the ranch ready and waiting for whenever the great stress of being the stupidest POTUS ever became too great for him. "working vacations"? Hell, he did not even bother to return to DC as the storm of the century approached NOLA.</comment>

<comment>How we well knew how far in the tank the liberal media already was for Obama, was when the New York Times pulled its quote of Obama and then airbrushed the later piece in which this quote was disappeared at 9:00 AM EST today.''Mr Obama indicated that he did not fully appreciate the public concern over the attacks in Paris and San Bernardino because he ''did not see enough cable television''...One can easily imagine a POTUS whose only means of grasping both international and domestic affairs, especially with as critical an issue as terrorism, is gleaned from watching a pack of non-FOX sycophants peddling their own versions of what was once called ''journalism'' on the boob-tube. Not for nothing then, and in horror, did the NY Times observe too late, that this portion of the article would not serve their master as he eclipses the worst [ worse than Bush in fact ], numbers of his presidency where his handling of terrorism is concerned in a new GALLUP poll.                        This is why each Defense Sec who served him apart from the purely political hack Carter, have lambasted and criticized Obamas inept responses to the threats both ISIS and other groups [ which now include a victorious Taliban in Afghanistan and a growing al Qaeda in Africa ] pose to the world. Worse, that the whole UN-brokered Peace Train in Syria is nothing more than a ship of fools, with Russia [ todays BBC ], now upping the ante against Turkey, which has now also angered Iraq, moving a larger naval presence into the waters off of the Dardanelles than even Obama has mustered with the US Navy, thus turning this region of the Med into a Russkie lake, armed with their latest in surface-to-air missiles and nuclear strike capability.                           How it is that we have come from 2008s cultish ''Hope and Change'' to a foreign and domestic policy that would be better run by the Marx Brothers, is something only an Obama could explain.If, of course, lying rags like the NY Times allowed him to do so........................http://thefederalist.com/2015/...</comment>

<comment>Sigh.  I still remember when The Atlantic's comment threads were at least 75% comprised of people who could write in full, reality-based sentences.</comment>

<comment>Then the angry taxpayers showed up.Edit:  OK I read the comments, you have a point.</comment>

<comment>That was before they started posting links to the articles on Breitbart and Daily Caller.</comment>

<comment>He did his typical Obama thing during the speech. He said "We" and "Our" when talking about failures or obstacles. But he switched to "I" when talking about success or being right.It really is all about him, all of the time. He does believe he is always right even when it is obvious he isn't. He just thinks we haven't caught up to him yet.</comment>

<comment>This from a TRUMPette...</comment>

<comment>He's the 'Narcissist in chief'</comment>

<comment>I would like Republicans, whose theme song this year seems to be that Obama is dumb, to actually listen to this press conference. Can any inside the clown car come close to matching his nuanced understanding of issues and his calm conclusions and judgments?</comment>

<comment>Why are his grades under lock and key?   The man is not nearly as smart as he thinks he is.   </comment>

<comment>Ummm, watch, listen, see a fine intellect in action. And, I suspect that history will show that he's been on top of a lot more than we are privy to. Obama-haters will always find another hoop that he should jump through. Birth certificates, college grades, what next?</comment>

<comment>By his own admission, he is lazy at heart and did not have the best of grades.  He did however benefit greatly from race-based accommodations.  In the aftermath of the '64 Civil Rights Act,  American universities scrambled to atone for, in certain cases, centuries of de facto discrimination in admissions and faculty hiring.  This required a significant lowering of standards.  Other than time spent at Occidental, Columbia and Harvard, the only indirect evidence we have about his academic credentials is that the small group which matriculated via transfer at Columbia when he did averaged a combined 1100 on their SATs.  This is considerably less than pedestrian by Ivy League standards.</comment>

<comment>And if he is such a "fine intellect" why is he consistently proven wrong?For example, he claimed ObamaCare would reduce healthcare costs.   The opposite has happened.He dismissed ISIS as a "JV team" and just before they attacked Paris he claimed that they were "contained".</comment>

<comment>Any Halfrican can sound intelligent when Jews and Whites write a script for him.  Just check any Hollywood blockbuster.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for being so honest. I suspect that VonKia and the other halfwits here would say much the same thing if they didn't want their racism exposed as yours is.</comment>

<comment>LOLz, I don't care.</comment>

<comment>Yet you never sound intelligent.</comment>

<comment>I didn't really need you to tell me you're one of the many humorless, lifeless dolts LARPing as humans around here, but thanks anyway.</comment>

<comment>Welcome. Anytime.</comment>

<comment>But you did forget "homophobic" and "sexist".</comment>

<comment>Yeah that Obama is so smart. Smart enough to wear those coattails that lost him the   House and Senate in TWO landslide losses to " the party of stupid". What a genius. </comment>

<comment>Another multi-million vacation for this clown paid for by the American tax-payer.</comment>

<comment>Working vacation.  Just like any other President.</comment>

<comment>Really?  What member's of Obama's cabinet or administration are going with him to Hawaii?</comment>

<comment>You're pretty clueless regarding the how the Presidency works.</comment>

<comment>I'm guessing you never complained about Bush's vacations...http://archives.politicususa.c..."The problem is that W. wasn’t thrifty. He was the most expensive vacation president in US history. Not only did Bush spend more days on vacation than any other president, but he used Air Force One more often while on vacation than any other president."</comment>

<comment>President Butte Nekkid golfs while Baltimore burns.</comment>

<comment>More failure from the second worst president in human history. His last name might as well be Bush..</comment>

<comment>President Barack Obama, "I’ve never been more optimistic about a year ahead than I am right now. And in 2016, I’m going to leave it out all on the field."Reading this comment has filled me with hope that Mr. and Mrs. Obama, America's premier parental figures, will find the strength and courage to use their voices addressing in plain spoken English, America's expanding and shameful *National Epidemic of Childhood Abuse and Neglect*, aka *Poverty*, that for more than two generations has deprived untold numbers of American kids from experiencing and enjoying a fairly happy American kid childhood with *Safe Streets* to travel and play on.*Child Abuse and Neglect* that is primarily responsible for populating our prisons with depressed, angry, frustrated, undisciplined, unpredictable, sometimes suicidal teens and adults full of resentment for irresponsibly being introduced to a life of hardships and struggles.*Early Childhood Abuse and Neglect* that often leads depressed, sometimes suicidal (NY Times May 18, 2015 - Rise in Suicide by Black Children Surprises Researchers) children to develop into depressed, angry, frustrated, unpredictable, sometimes suicidal teens and adults lacking empathy and compassion for others, though needing to vent their pent up negative emotions, often causing emotional and physical harm to peaceful people...instead of venting their anger, resentment and pain on the immature single moms and/or dads who introduced them to a life of pain and struggle by irresponsibly building a family before acquiring the practical skills, *PATIENCE* and means to successfully raise and nurture a developing young child who matures into a fairly happy responsible teen and adult with mostly fond memories of his or her childhood.The question all concerned, compassionate Americans should seriously be asking ourselves, our elected, civil, social, community and religious leaders is, "What real, substantial changes in our society's attitude and laws need to occur to prevent abuse that often causes young kids to mature into depressed, frustrated, angry teens and adults as a result of experiencing the emotional and/or physical trauma of an abusive childhood?"*Suicidal Behaviors in the African American Community*http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pm...Peace & Happy Holidays!Black *(Children's)* Lives Matter; Take Pride In Parenting; *End Our National Epidemic of Child Abuse and Neglect*; End Community Violence, Police Fear & Educator's Frustrations...</comment>

<comment>Putin's presser was way better.  Everyone should watch it on YouTube as a lesson in compare and contrast.https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=...Putin draws a much bigger crowd and answers real questions. </comment>
