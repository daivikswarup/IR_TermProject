<comment>Sanders is a lying cheating Communist coward. This proves it.</comment>

<comment>Yet he is still better than anyone in the Republican field.</comment>

<comment>DNFLike...seriously. This dude read a criticism of Rand Paul that I wrote and decided I was a Paul supporter. No one's THAT stupid.</comment>

<comment>And the worse candidate in the Republican race is still unqualified.</comment>

<comment>Debatable. How can you run against Hillary without hitting her greatest weakness, her integrity?I would question his intelligence.</comment>

<comment>Why do that when you never expected to win in the first place and just wanted to shift the conversation?This is like Rubio's campaign bro lol except the GOP field is so shitty that Rubio upped his dreams of being VP to President.</comment>

<comment>A little off subject, but, ... I think Trump might have also upped his game from being a poop disturber to actually living in the White House.Good Point.</comment>

<comment>It's so odd the left has convinced itself that Hillary Clinton, someone who's never found a war she doesn't like, is the sane one, while Trump, whose foreign policy is pretty much indistinguishable from Obama's (except he wants to work more with our traditional enemies) is the crazy warmonger...</comment>

<comment>I once supported Barry Goldwater when I was in grade 11.I'm sorry.Are you perfect and proud in your behavior all these years?Maybe Hilary cannot be judged by what she did in different circumstances in a different place and time.Is that a hard concept for you?</comment>

<comment>And it is revealed that Rubio HAS NO ORGANIZATION.The guy is not ready for prime time.  (Nor is Cruz)What a dilemma!  So many haters ready to hate and no leader to carry the benefits of the hate home to the GOP reactionaries!</comment>

<comment>What integrity?</comment>

<comment>Your record as a hater makes your indictment nothing but another mean-spirited anonymous attack..You are a waste of "speech".</comment>

<comment>Hate the game, not the player.</comment>

<comment>hence "his RECORD"I don't think you have the presence to tell the difference.Are you a "player" or an anonymous adolescent behaving jerk?(*jerk* is hating the player)</comment>

<comment>Hillary, is that you?</comment>

<comment>What I like about your comment is your user name, because it makes it even harder to tell if you're a sarcastic Millennial troll or an earnest, ignorant NeoMcCarthyite baby boomer.</comment>

<comment>Bernie is the most honest guy out there.</comment>

<comment>Careful, he's gonna call you a "sissy" and offer to come over to your house!</comment>

<comment>For sex!</comment>

<comment>Yes. Vote Republican, right?Putz.</comment>

<comment>http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry...</comment>

<comment>That proves nothing of the sort, moron.</comment>

<comment>The DNC allowed access. They are simply shifting blame. Why wouldn't someone who has paid for access to a list take whatever is made available? </comment>

<comment>That's like saying I "allowed you access" to my mail because I didn't padlock my mailbox.  Just because the firewall is down it doesn't suddenly make it ethical to read someone else's data.</comment>

<comment>But what if there was mail in that mailbox addressed to me?As I understand, Sanders campaign has paid to access the DNC lists. The DNC kept several lists on their servers and apparently at least one was restricted to the Clinton campaign. Nothing was taken or copied. Then, to top it off, the Sanders campaign has been warning the DNC and the company that managed the server of the hole.Your analogy sounds good, but isn't necessarily applicable to this case.</comment>

<comment>But this wasn't addressed to Sanders.  This was just them flat out reading Clinton's mail.Not sure where you're getting that nothing was copied.</comment>

<comment>Clinton...Democrats........ethical.......... That's a good one LOL.</comment>

<comment>This is a bush league  Donald Seggreti stunt being played by  Hilaryhack Debbie Wasserman  Schultz and her munchkins.  She of the lame ass  Saturday before Christmas  debate.</comment>

<comment>Look at that, the Times finally covered Sanders' campaign.</comment>

<comment>Covering a losing campaign is boring.  A losing campaign that breaks the rules to read their opponent's data?  Slightly more interesting.Don't worry, they'll cover Sanders when he loses the first few primaries and when he concedes, too.</comment>

<comment>They aren't covering the Democratic campaign simply because the Clown Car is much more interesting, in the same way a train wreck gets attention.</comment>

<comment>Would you be attacking Republicans if you were a Dem candidate?Not a chance.  They are safely playing in their own muck, showing the world their clueless angry narrow minded money hunt.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a speech from Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>thank you very much</comment>

<comment>Yea, issues such as the economy and terrorism that the Republicans talk about are all a distraction.  And besides, the People want to hear about all the free stuff they will be getting.</comment>

<comment>Scared Shtless Republicans make great company for you.The rest of us do not let fear occupy our entire frontal cortex.</comment>

<comment>The last ten and next 30 Republican debates;"Obama sumptin', sumptin' ...""No Hillary sumptin' sumptin' ...""Ya but it's Obama sumptin', sumptin, ...""I got a plan"Obama sumptin' sumptin' ..."And Mr Carson, what do you have to add , "...""BENGHAZIIIII ", oh, and "EMAAAAAIL"Ya, America feels much better.</comment>

<comment>A real, wide open campaign is always more interesting than a coronation. Especially a coronation where the royalty is so unappealing that the only way to keep her numbers up is to keep her in hiding! thus the Saturday night before Christmas debate schedule. I'm only surprised that Hillary's loyal servant, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, didn't schedule the debate for 3 AM.Your candidate is like Dracula, she cannot stand the sunshine.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they will cover him when he runs as an Independent!RUN BERNIE, but not as a corrupt Democrat.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>um, he is running for the Dem nomination.Let's call that "Democrat".</comment>

<comment>With whom? The 1%? I guess you own both parties now - imagine that.</comment>

<comment>So why was he at the Democratic Candidates Debate????Do you own a TV or read newspapers?  Perhaps you were kidding?</comment>

<comment>People all over will be saying Who's this Sanders guy - ha ha.  Clinton will be left looking like Wiley Coyote after his Acme bomb blew up.</comment>

<comment>Who knows?  Its a while before November 2016.</comment>

<comment>When the DNC establishment starts acting like the establishment Sanders is pointing out in his campaign, then that makes the DNC the problem.</comment>

<comment>Don't be ridiculous & hypocritical. If this were the other way around, the  Sanders campaign would be howling that this was an example  of "Clinton politics" that Sanders has been campaigning against. Your guy is being held accountable for a screw up by one of his over-zealous employees/supporters. There are zealous idiots with poor judgment in every campaign & it's the responsibility of each candidate to make sure those supporters toe the line & don't go overboard by violating campaign rules. Accountability is not conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>The data was on the DNC servers. Why can't Sanders access the data on the servers, inquiring minds ask.</comment>

<comment>All campaigns have access to the server's main data, but data added by individual campaigns' field workers (i.e., greater details such as which issues are most important to specific voters) is protected for each campaign by individual firewalls.  Again, don't ridiculously confuse being held accountable to rules for there being some sort of conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>Then why didn't the Clinton campaign use their own servers?</comment>

<comment>Why are you trying to blame the victim?</comment>

<comment>Dude, your car was in your garage, but you left the door open and the keys in it. It's your fault I drove it to California. Really man, do better.</comment>

<comment>They should be careful.  People who live in glass houses.... </comment>

<comment>sounds like another Wasserman-Shultz stunt. Maybe we can talk about it at the debate on saturday night. UGH!</comment>

<comment>No, it sounds like Sanders has the exact same problem of any major campaign: difficulty in making sure that his supporters don't become lost in their passion and go off the reservation and do something stupid in the belief that they are helping their candidate. Happens all the time, but this situation is more visible because it is also a hacking case.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps, but his campaign has been bringing this security failure to the DNC and the tech company's attention before this happened. The DNC has already said that nothing was taken or copied. I betcha if this street were driving the other direction, it would be a different story. The only reason that this is "more visible" is because the BS people in the media finally found something that is at least a little bit salacious, at least to them.</comment>

<comment>It's Gray Hat (hacking), at best.</comment>

<comment>So who's the victim?</comment>

<comment>It's not a 'hacking' case. Nobody did any 'hacking'.A user in a shared computing environment was giving incorrect permissions by the system.  They then used this to access some stuff that they "weren't supposed to", but in a way allowed by said system.That is not a 'hacking' case.  It's an 'incompetent IT' case.</comment>

<comment>Wasserman-Shultz needs a happy Bernie. Her timing to withhold is strategically blunderous. If Sanders has an ounce of Machievelli in him he should threaten to run independently.</comment>

<comment>Her won't do that Im afraid, however, I hope he stands up to this and gets it fixed right quick!</comment>

<comment>dream on jeff</comment>

<comment>NGP VAN, the IT Company who contracts the DNC voter database has on multiple occasions failed to keep Sanders and Clinton data separated.   The Sanders campaign has reported the problem at least three times to NGP VAN.  They have repeatedly failed to fix it.   It should be noted NGP VAN CEO and founder is Hillary Clinton's 2008 Campaign CTO and remains a supporter and donor to Clinton.   The DNC is finally starting to act on their internal panic.   Sanders is pulling ahead on ground game in Iowa and way ahead in NH - So now Debbie Wasserman Schultz needs to manufacture negative press (which she has done rather well) and Hillary Clinton and her former campaign CTO get to giggle Sanders is being blamed for NGP VAN's errors, and use it as an excuse to kneecap Sander's winning field and ground-game of Sanders by cutting off access to data.You can read a very clear reporting on the issue, which has gone on for months in the British press. http://www.theguardian.com/us-...</comment>

<comment>Sounds like the DNC and the Clinton campaign are getting nervous. Good!</comment>

<comment>Nervous about what?   A guy who's been stagnant in the polls since August?  The Democratic primary is effectively over.</comment>

<comment>Polls? Traditional polling probably not a very good measure of Sanders' support.  He has 2 million people contributing to his campaign. I'd say the polls are missing his demographic.</comment>

<comment>Bernie recently said they cannot hire people fast enough.  The speed and pace of the Sanders campaign was stronger than they could have anticipated.Keep in mind, Sanders has been running for a matter of months, while Hilary has been running for much longer and with a lifetime of friends and supporters.Americans say, "Who?  Bernie who?"Vermont sends him back by 40% when they get asked.</comment>

<comment>If the DNC thinks shutting out the voters that Sanders brings to the polls is a winning strategy, then they deserve to get clobbered again.</comment>

<comment>Don't let the infighting distract you.  Democrats never get along but they know which side of the toast has marmalade.</comment>

<comment>Not sure what you mean about marmalade. isn't that a big dog? ha ha.The problem I suppose, is that people are excited that Bernie is not working for special interests. He has engaged a lot of voters who, in the past, saw both candidates' strings being pulled by the banks and big business and decided to stay home. I don't see a lot of people who traditionally wouldn't vote getting excited about voting for Citibank.</comment>

<comment>Those voters need a reason to vote. In 2004 Howard Dean gave them a reason but couldn't hold it together. During the election they stayed home.  In 2008 Obama took those same voters, kept them and went to victory. He repeated the same thing in 2012.Sanders's support is coming from the same group. If he can go on to the nomination he will win in November. If he loses then many (most) will stay home. These high energy voters are not mainstream, enthusiastic center supporters, I don't see them going for Clinton. Some may if they see the choice is a Trump or Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.Anecdotally, I was excited about Obama in 2008, until he decided to turn "Hope and Change" to more of the same and started accepting campaign contributions from big banks.  I voted for President in 08 and 2012, but not for a D or R. My state is solid blue... it's hard to say what I would have done if I lived in Ohio of Florida, probably would have held my nose and voted for Obama.You might be right about voting against Cruz. I'm afraid that Ralph Nader was right when he said that "there isn't a dime's worth of difference between the Democrats and the Republicans".  I just don't believe that Hillary isn't going to do anything that threatens the profits of her big donor friends.</comment>

<comment>"Vermont sends him back by 25% when they get asked."In a close election.  More like 40% most of the time.</comment>

<comment>fixed thanks</comment>

<comment>Much ado about the same old mistake: ideology does not fundamentally alter human nature; bad apples are in every bunch of any size. To think that lofty ideals guarantee reformation of all character is a chimera, and yet this misconception consistently serves as a trope by opponents to undermine any value those policies might contain.Get over it. Human nature isn't going anywhere anytime soon. The only matter to judge is how well the campaign explains, remedies, and acts to lessen such actions in the future.</comment>

<comment>The irony. Or wait: is this a political false-flag operation to draw media attention to the campaign?</comment>

<comment>Protip:  if you start calling something a "false flag operation" it just tells the rest of us to ignore you as a tinfoil-hat wearing crazy person.</comment>

<comment>Or maybe a failed attempt at comedy?</comment>

<comment>Well, damn. You go to bed thinking your guy is morally superior to the Cardinals, and you wake up to find out he still is, by a lot, but also by a little bit less.</comment>

<comment>Supporters, ALLEGEDLY, not the Senator.Can you differentiate?</comment>

<comment>Eh, doesn't really matter, because he's going to get knocked out in the early rounds by a North Sider. JUST LIKE THE DIRTY BIRDS</comment>

<comment>1908 friend... 1908.</comment>

<comment>Everybody bugs everybody else. The fact that it is Hillary Clinton complaining about it, of all people, is the exceptional fact.Of course, there is also the possibility of a false flag.</comment>

<comment>Great moments in technology:2008: Secretary of State Hillary Clinton implements homebrew email server 2013: HealthCare.gov serves 6 users on its first day2015: Socialists access DNC voter dataI assume that Republicans are just as inept as Democrats when it comes to these things. But all the interesting stories are coming from the donkey side of the aisle.</comment>

<comment>All according to the  master plan.  Next step, Bernie stops being the 'loyal opposition' and throws support behind hillary's coronation.  A well executed plan is a beautiful thing to watch.</comment>

<comment>The DNC is in Hillary's pocket. None too shocking-just look at what they've done with the debate timing.Sanders has served his purpose for them, now they will give him the knife.</comment>

<comment>Hillary, on paper, is the most qualified person to run for the office in many generations.We do realize the haters can't help themselves.But she deserves a chance to lead this country as much as any of them do.Bernie has better grasp of the real fight and the real disease in America.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is not qualified.</comment>

<comment>To be starting QB for the Ravens this Sunday?Trigger Warning?  What's that name about?  Are you a man with a gun?Do you hate Democrats liberals progressives or just certain Americans?</comment>

<comment>I do hate Democrats liberals progressives.  And Hilary is not qualified to POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your self-identification.  I thought you were serious.</comment>

<comment>Your polices always fail.</comment>

<comment>Always will outlive the both of us.</comment>

<comment>Yes..the progressive failed polices will outlive us.</comment>

<comment>BTW...If you are going to use the world "socialism" in a sentence. You should know what it means.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I've never been able to get into the pathology of the Clinton haters, much like the Nixon haters before them and the Obama haters after them, even if I theoretically understand the basis of it. Though to be fair, Hillary does a lot to feed the hatred. Listing half of the country as your "enemy" with a proud tone (if you want to believe that in private, fine, but getting applauded for it at a primary is a different matter) isn't exactly an indication that she'll do the work necessary with Congress.On paper-in reality, it's a little less impressive, IMHO. That being said, while we've had more qualified candidates in the past(Eisenhower, Lyndon Johnson, Nixon, the first Bush), but in this race, undoubtedly. And she's the favorite. Clinton is on planet Earth, for all her faults. Though I take issue with the word "deserves"-nobody deserves anything in politics, it's about who wins.Yes, at least socioeconomically, but there is absolutely no way he's winning 270 electoral votes. Hillary, on the other hand, is increasingly using identity politics as a substitute for real reform. Nothing wrong with identity politics by itself, but using it in that fashion is deeply irresponsible.</comment>

<comment>"Deserves a chance"???As for "most qualified": Her politically motivated vote to kill hundreds of thousands of people in Iraq disqualifies her. She has a history of poor judgment, and that's at the top of the list.In order to appear "tough," she'll have the US invading wherever her neocon buddies think it's time for more democracy. Clinton: More war, more nothing for average Americans.</comment>

<comment>She's  a decent Republican candidate. I'm beginning to understand what Soviet elections must have felt like.</comment>

<comment>To expand on your timing point, the three debates have been*on a Saturday night, during college football season, when Iowa was scheduled to play a major game*this one - on one of the last Christmas shopping weekends of the yearand the kicker - the third one is *scheduled to take place during the NFL playoffs*Could they make it any more obvious? </comment>

<comment>This could be changed yes?</comment>

<comment>If there's enough outcry about it I'd hope so. Something funny is going on.</comment>

<comment>I think it WILL change.(but that's a guess)</comment>

<comment>The debates have little meaning when there are just two candidates. The media will tell us the next day who blew what. Those who don't know yet who they will support won't be convinced by a TV debate.Currently the debates are watched mostly by those supporting a specific candidate. They want to see their knight slay the other impostors on the stage. They watch to see the candidates they don't support step in a pile of poop.</comment>

<comment>yes. in 2020.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter, Bernie is the DNC in 10 years and he knows it.The blue dog, establishment, Wall Street, appeal to neo-liberalism, crowd is slowly becoming irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>The DNC is trying to sabotage Sanders.  Good stuff.</comment>

<comment>Sanders supporters are doing just fine sabotaging their own campaign.</comment>

<comment>In what way?</comment>

<comment>Everyone knows the DNC is bought and paid for by the Clinton Machine.  Aren't they afraid of exposing Hillary for the power hungry paranoid b*tch she is?  BERNIE, RUN AS AN INDEPENDENT.  Forget the corrupt DNC.</comment>

Shouldn't be too hard to snatch it from him when it's time to take his heart meds.</comment>

<comment>Settle down, Beavis.</comment>

<comment>Where is the DNC's reassurance that the Clinton campaign did not access Sanders' data?It seems to me that the only reason they are aware of the breach was due to the decision by the Sanders' camp to report it. Hell, Clinton camp could have been using it for who knows how long.</comment>

<comment>The DNC works for Clinton (in case we needed further proof).It will be fun to see what payoff Wasserman-Schulz gets after the coronation of Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Whether it's true or not Bernie will not be the nominee. He is doing a great job and drawing fantastic crowds which bodes well for Democrats. As much as his supporters love him and they certainly do they sure as heck won't vote Republican should he not get the nomination that's for sure. No way can we let a Republican anywhere near the White House. We know how they roll. Get in, cause havoc and get us in more wars than you can shake a stick at & then get voted out. In comes a Democrat yet again to clean up their mess. Happens every time.</comment>

<comment>Check your calendar.  Keep in mind over a billion dollars will be spent to stop her, and there will be some bombshell/October surprise/smear campaign redux.Therefore, keep your powder dry and your politics principled.After all it is the effect of a progressive POTUS we need, not necessarily the body.</comment>

<comment>I think you are a little overzealous in thinking that Bernie's crowd sizes are necessarily a great thing for the Democrats. There were many Bernie supporters that were not going to vote for Hillary and go third party or abstain. I can't imagine how this issue with the DNC, when you hear very vocally that his supporters think they are in the wrong, will endear them to voting for Clinton.I think the Clinton campaign & the DNC are actually going to have to woo them if the time comes. I mean, I've seen 1/3 to 1/4 of the party choosing Sanders in polls. Come general election time that is no little number.</comment>

<comment>Can't see Democrats abstaining just because Bernie isn't going to be the nominee.  Especially when they know what faces the country God forbid a Trump or any Republican come to that take back the White House. To think by them not voting for Hillary could maybe put the people back in power that only run the country into the ground.  That would be pure insanity.</comment>

<comment>I am a registered Independent, auto-donate to Bernie every month, and refuse to hold my nose and vote for Hillary in the general.Similarly, a significant percentage of my registered "D" and "I" friends, family & colleagues have stated their intent to abstain in the general if Hillary is the nominee.Talk is cheap, of course, but the motivation is real.*shrug*</comment>

<comment>People have the right to vote for whom they wish of course but to not vote for Hillary with the chance of letting a Republican back in the White House is sheer folly.</comment>

<comment>Bernie is a great guy.  I love how he's transformed the dialogue.  But he can't win the primary.  Endorsements from congressmen, senators, governors, mayors, etc (they will commit their district to voter turnout): Hillary- 455Bernie- 2Superdelegates-Hillary- 359 Bernie - 8As for the general election, if the GOP grows up and gets their act together and puts Rubio forward, Sanders would lose to him.</comment>

<comment>Most voters don't care about who their elected officials endorse. Endorsements are all about politics. If I endorse Sanders, will President Hillary shut me out? If I endorse Hillary early, will she reward me with a cabinet position?</comment>

<comment>When a mayor of a major metropolitan city endorses a candidate they are committing their entire political machine to voter turnout for that candidate.  That's boots on the ground and it's a big deal.</comment>

<comment>Nurses, Communications Wokers and several other national unions have endorsed for the Senator.That's a big deal too.</comment>

<comment>wow.</comment>

<comment>You can cite endorsements as much as you want. But you have to prove that they actually matter to voters.</comment>

<comment>Got another synapse?  Or is that one firing at will?</comment>

<comment>Try coming up with something more clever. While you're at it, tell me why endorsements matter to voters.</comment>

<comment>I think it should be differentiated that there are some unions that decide who they back, and others that have the members vote on who they back.I wonder if there is information out there that shows how things pan out with the former.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't matter if they can't convince me to vote for the candidate they endorsed.</comment>

<comment>You're voting for Bernie in the primary, that's good.  But Bernie won't be in the general election is my point.</comment>

<comment>You're changing the subject. We're talking about the value of endorsements. People aren't going to suddenly vote for Hillary in the primaries just because all the party bigwigs endorsed her. As for the general election, I live in a red state so my vote for President is pretty much wasted anyway. I'm certainly not going to waste it voting for Hillary who I despise. If Bernie were the nominee, my vote still wouldn't change the outcome. But at least I'd be proud to cast a vote for him. This is the lesson the Democratic party has yet to learn. When you pick a candidate who doesn't excite the base, you get low turnout. See Al Gore, John Kerry, Alison Lundergan Grimes, Michelle Nunn, Jason Carter, and Mary Landrieu.</comment>

<comment>You're changing the subject.I'm the OP in this thread, remember?  ;)</comment>

<comment>I know you are. So tell me again what your point is. You say Bernie can't win the primary because Hillary has all the endorsements. But I already told you that people who vote in primaries don't care about endorsements.</comment>

<comment>You mean you don't care about endorsements.  Fine.  But when the governors of New York, Virginia, Colorado, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, etc endorse a candidate it means their political machine will be put to use at the grass roots.  They will make phone calls, give out the lawn signs and go door to door for that candidate.  This is why endorsements are crucial for voter turnout.  It's not some hollow gesture as you seem to think it is, it's a commitment of their network to the campaign.It's how politics works.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I get how politics work. But here's what you're failing to show. How does any of that cause me or anyone else to support Hillary if I didn't already?</comment>

<comment>You say you get how politics work but your question shows that you don't.  So, yeah.</comment>

<comment>No, my question shows that I understand how people work. Now either answer my question or I'll take that to mean you don't know the answer.</comment>

<comment>Think of it as a concerted advertising campaign for a brand of shampoo.  Yes, you may be very happy with your brand and won't try another but there are lots of people who haven't made up their mind or are open to persuasion.  They see their neighbors are using that shampoo and so they think maybe they should try it too.  This is basic human nature.Anyway, my original point is that Hillary has the primary locked up.  The international betting markets agree with me:Clinton 1/12Sanders 6/1These are people who are putting their money, not their politics, on the line.  They also show Rubio as the 6/4 favorite for the GOP nomination.  With Clinton's odds at 8/11 and Rubio 9/2 in the general.http://www.paddypower.com/bet/...</comment>

<comment>Here's where your analogy falls apart. I can try a different shampoo, but I'm always free to go back to the one I preferred. With voting, you don't have that luxury. Once you vote in the primary, you can't go back and change it. Besides, the idea that there are still a lot of people who haven't made up their mind or are open to changing it is a myth. People made up their minds about Hillary a LONG time ago. Notice how the polls really haven't changed that much in the last few months. And if you understand the appeal of Bernie Sanders, you'll see why establishment endorsements of Hillary will only reinforce their support for Sanders. Why? Because the endorsements confirm what they already think of Hillary, that she's another party insider out of touch with the real world.</comment>

<comment>Tell you what.  I'll meet you here March 2nd 2016, the day after Super Tuesday and we'll discuss the results.  Is it a date?</comment>

<comment>I'm not disputing that Hillary will be the nominee. My point is that the endorsements won't be the reason. She already has 2/3 of voters. Will the remaining 1/3 who now support Bernie suddenly vote Hillary in the primaries? I doubt it. Endorsements are about bragging rights and little more.</comment>

<comment>I'm not disputing that Hillary will be the nominee. Thank you. Shows over folks, nothing more to see.</comment>

<comment>Nope, show's not over. Cause you still failed to show how endorsements will cause Bernie supporters to switch. Hillary supporters are hilarious. They're always anxious to declare things finished. Why is that? Fear?</comment>

<comment>I hope you're not correct because I'm very afraid that a Hillary win in the primaries will essentially be giving the oval office to the Republicans. Where she fails to excite the Left, she sure does energize the Right.I will be voting for Bernie regardless. Go ahead and tell me how naughty I am for exercising my sovereign franchise and remind me how easily American "democracy" slips into Stalinist party politics.</comment>

<comment>I'm just reporting what the betting markets are saying.  These aren't people who were passively polled about who they want to win, an emotional choice with no consequence if they are wrong.  Gamblers, on the other hand, make a rational decision to put their money on the outcome of who they believe will win regardless of their own politics.  Notice the difference?  Betting markets are historically better at predicting outcomes than polls.But polls still offer useful information.  Sanders' problem in a general election is his poor polling with minorities.  A friend of mine said Bernie is the 'Phish' candidate.  He mostly appeals to young white liberal males.</comment>

<comment>You should brace yourself for some kind of dirty trick surprise from the right.  Hillary is too hated and they are too rich to let this election unfold holistically.You may be right.But Democratic voters won't suddenly vote for the reactionaries, no matter who is the Dem standard bearer.</comment>

<comment>But they will likely stay home as they did in 2010, 2012. Clinton doesn't energize.</comment>

<comment>Its the big moment for Americans when they get to vote.Most of them won't.</comment>

<comment>They certainly won't be more inclined to vote just because their mayor or Senator endorsed Hillary.</comment>

<comment>name and policy recognition</comment>

<comment>So? Hillary already has name recognition. How does my mayor endorsing her make me more likely to vote for her?</comment>

<comment>I guess Bernie benefits more than Hillary from increased name recognition.btw, you aren't going to vote for any Dems anyway, right?</comment>

<comment>Hillary already has maximum name recognition so any endorsements she gets won't make any difference. As for who I'm voting for, I live in a red state so my vote is wasted on the Presidential election. Even if Bernie were the nominee, he wouldn't win my state. I plan to vote for Dems in lower elections where it matters, like governor, Senator, state legislature, mayor, etc.</comment>

<comment>good dawg.</comment>

<comment>Really? Is that all you have? Sad.</comment>

<comment>Rubio does not even have an organization.  His campaign, when it hits the states, is bringing a pea shooter to a gun show.</comment>

<comment>I have stated this in other places. I do agree with you that SOME of these endorsees will get their political machines to go to work for Clinton, however a lot of them are using their political capital in other ways. Chances are they are more concerned with their own necks.Also, in the Democratic Party superdelegates only make up 20% of the vote of the convention. The other 80% are delegates which come directly from the primary votes (so in a way, if you live in a red state this is when it matters who you vote for).Superdelegates can also switch their votes and sometimes do. They can cite anything from, "I want to vote with my constituency" or "I don't like your campaign tactics" (this happened to Clinton in 2008, someone switched to Obama). It could happen that if the primaries shake out in Sanders favor, some superdelegates will switch.I'm not saying Sanders is going to get it; I'm just saying this is a more complicated process than already highlighted.</comment>

<comment>It is complicated, I agree.  And there's no single factor that will determine the outcome.  What I am saying is Sanders won't win the primary.  And it will be for a number of reasons.  His extreme deficits with regard to endorsements and superdelegates are an example of the obstacles he faces.  His poor polling with minorities is another and perhaps it's his biggest problem.I think Bernie is a great guy and the part he's playing in this race by forcing voters to confront certain issues like inequality is awesome.  He's forced Clinton to position herself more to the left and it's great.  Still, when it comes to electing a president, I'll take a hard nosed realist over an idealist every time.[in case it's not already obvious, the first § is my take on the outcome, the second § is my personal view]</comment>

<comment>A bug in the code? Yeah right. Looks more like a setup.</comment>

<comment>Is the Sanders campaign getting a little desperate?</comment>

<comment>no.  It has growing pains, yes.Bernie is out there talking you don't have to guess his thinking, as it is straight-up honest.</comment>

<comment>He calls himself a socialist. That's doom for getting moderate and Independent votes.</comment>

<comment>Show us polling data to back up this claim.</comment>

<comment>He's been in Congress for a long time, I mean, for a guy that can't win an election...</comment>

<comment>Winning a Senate seat is the same as the presidency?</comment>

<comment>"That's doom for getting moderate and Independent votes."He gets plenty of Republican and Independent votes today.  More than she ever did.  Can you spell election?</comment>

<comment>What? A Senate race is limited to the state the candidate is running in. A presidential race is national. You might want to do some Googling and get back to us.</comment>

<comment>I think the argument is that Sanders has more independent support, and even to a degree Republican support. This is true. Neither of those groups look favorably on Clinton.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Sanders has the kind of support you think he does. If we believed the propaganda coming out of extremist candidates, Trump would be King of the World. Smaller, fringe campaigns tend to yell the loudest making themselves sound much bigger than they actually are.</comment>

<comment>I think Clinton has more of the moderate vote, but Sanders has more of the independent vote from what I've seen. I'm not saying these are large numbers by any means. I think more people report themselves as being independents than they actually are.At this point considering the numbers both Trump & Sanders are pulling I wondering call them fringe, although they certainly started that way.</comment>

<comment>Running for the Democratic Presidential Nomination.jus sayin</comment>

<comment>Yes, and he won't get it.</comment>

<comment>Take your pick; Cruz, Rubio, or Trump versus Sanders. Do you stay home, hold your nose, or vote for the least crazy guy?</comment>

<comment>Ah....Clinton? She's leading Bernie by a wide margin in most states and beats the GOP candidates.</comment>

<comment>And if Hillary Clinton has a severe stroke or becomes incapacitated tomorrow, ...</comment>

<comment>This strikes me as the Clinton campaign getting a little desperate, doing everything it can to survive. Kind of sad really.</comment>

<comment>What evidence do you have of that? Seems that the story is about a Sanders staffer going too far to help Bernie gain an edge on the Democratic front runner.</comment>

<comment>It's rather hard to "gain an edge" on the Hillary Clinton campaign when the DNC is firmly in her pocket, debates have been limited to a paltry few and scheduled for times like tomorrow night when nobody will be watching.  Curly-toothed Debbie has made sure that the DNC's handpicked, preordained Republican, war-mongering candidate will get the nod.The article itself contradicts the data contractor who clearly stated that while someone might look at Clinton data, there was no way to download it or otherwise save it.Right on cue, the media, who've never missed an opportunity to note that Bernie is "a Socialist" were more than happy to jump on this and it will be all over the news.  Some reports are asking if this is the end of his campaign already.  God knows, they wouldn't want to get involved with breaking down the numbers on his policy proposals!It couldn't come soon enough for a front-running candidate with nothing to offer but duplicity and right-wing Defense Department thrall, and a free rein for her very special friends on Wall Street.</comment>

<comment>"Socialism" is no different than "Communism" and "Marxism" to most Americans. And, Bernie won't be able to educate them on the differences. Its a non-starter from day one.</comment>

<comment>"And, Bernie won't be able to educate them on the differences."Ding Dong Debbie is trying very hard to make sure of that...Have you thought about what happens when ten million Democrats smell a rat and stay home next November?</comment>

<comment>Smell a rat? What?! I don't understand your fantasy there, Irish. You think - with corporate wh*ring, theocratic, trickle down conservatives controlling the House, the Supreme Court and maybe the Senate - liberals are going to allow the presidency to go to Trump or Cruz? Really?! Come on now. You're getting too worked up over some talking points from the Sanders campaign.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm a life-long Democrat who's fed up with a political party that has lost its way.  If we're going to have a Republican in the White House, it might as well be one who's brave enough to admit it.I supported Hillary in 2008.  I've learned a lot since then.  I have no problem whatsoever filling out my ballot and mailing it in with no entry for President.  She's a serial liar in thrall with Wall Street and ready to start another war.She's hellbent on enriching her family and little else, and she's as phony as a three-dollar bill.</comment>

<comment>I don't buy it. You've got right wing style, over the top outrage that doesn't make sense. Conservative trolls pretending to be ex-Democrats is a fairly common game on these comment threads.</comment>

<comment>Let me assure you that, as a Bernie Sanders supporter who donates automatically to him every month, I know what my political affiliation is.  You can Google "desperate" and reflect on your reaction to the very real disgust tens of millions of registered Democrats have toward Debbie Wasserman Schultz and the DNC.  We can stay home on election day, no problem.</comment>

<comment>We can stay home on election day, no problem.========Nope, still don't believe that empty threat.</comment>

<comment>You might as well start counting yard signs in Ohio, too.</comment>

<comment>What does that mean? Does yard signs equal winning?</comment>

<comment>If you don't know what it means, I'm wondering if you aren't a GOP troll.</comment>

<comment>Huh....yard signs = electoral success. Who knew?</comment>

<comment>If Clinton's side had been doing the probing, the Sanders folks would be screaming "Watergate!"</comment>

<comment>Much ado about nothing. Nothing to see here, move along...</comment>

<comment>Hillary was probably storing all that data on her highly secure personal server!!</comment>

<comment>The DNC is a creature of the Clinton campaign.  This is not news, nor is it a criticism.The DNC engaged an incompetent IT vendor.  This is news, and a criticism, maybe not so much a surprise.Sanders employs smart young IT people, who do not know the Ways of the World, but discovered the flaw in the DNC procedures, handled it wrong, and one got fired.  Also news, not surprising.The DNC slaps their monarch's rival.  Also unsurprising news.The Clintonista ConcernTroll CommentBots are turned loose.  Welome to the 20th Century.I bet the Clinton High Command is just terrified that the Sanders campaign had access to a list of donors with palms that are both damp and green.  What are they going to do, overwhelm the chicken flock's spam boxes?Man.  Slow news day.  Lotsa news,  none surprising.</comment>

<comment>Never mind Sanders and his free stuff. The real issues are Benghazi, e mails and more juicy expensive wars to wage.</comment>

<comment>Drink!</comment>

<comment>Who's Ben Ghazi? And, why do the right wing propagandists obsess over him when everyone has moved on with their lives?</comment>

<comment>The DNC certainly has an iron hand on the presidential campaigns this year.</comment>

<comment>Punishing a campaign for a major rule violation is "an iron hand"?</comment>

<comment>Seeing as this was caused by a computer glitch, and campaigning is a world of backstabbing and underhanded deals, yeah; seems like the DNC would really like to take a shot at Sanders.</comment>

<comment>a computer glitch==========Suuuuuuuure it was. They fired the staffer for a "computer glitch".</comment>

<comment>The software vendor seems to think it's a computer glitch too, and I'm inclined to agree with them.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>She should have had her data on a more secure server. Again.</comment>

<comment>Reading.... it's what all the cool kids are doing.</comment>

<comment>I suspect we'll see more of this as the Sanders campaign fails to make significant inroads into Hillary strong base of support.</comment>

<comment>Sock puppets.</comment>

<comment>Clinton is using her power to make this happen. Glitches don't just happen at the perfect time like this. Right after Bernie gets great endorsements and right before the debate? Clinton did this on purpose</comment>

<comment>Low on tin foil for your hat?</comment>

<comment>Because it's beyond the realm of possibility for someone like her?</comment>

<comment>The Sanders campaign got busted cheating. Just deal with it and stop wasting time with that BS.</comment>

<comment>Right, because the former Walmart lawyer Clinton wouldn't use her power to trash a rival</comment>

<comment>She'd make a better Republicanhttp://m.huffpost.com/us/entry...</comment>

<comment>There's also a chance that Hillary staffers have captured a Big Foot and is using him as bait to trap the Loch Ness monster.</comment>

<comment>Sure, and she didn't set up the Democratic debate schedule to suit her own goals either</comment>

<comment>Whatever. Moving on now.</comment>

<comment>Remember how confident Hillary was around this time in 2008? Or maybe you weren't born yet</comment>

<comment>Using the same logic, it may just as well have been the Illuminati.</comment>

<comment>I dismiss this idea not because I think Clinton is above such devious tactics I dismiss this idea because Sanders has never and will never be a significant candidate for President.</comment>

<comment>Oh No's, not St.Bernie.</comment>

<comment>My guess is the patch went through and the glitch opened the data.  Some folks in the Bernie campaign noticed it, and it sounds like 4 folks were at least curious enough to look into it.  That's bad, but not really surprising.It doesn't sound like the Bernie campaign intentionally tried to create access to the data they weren't supposed to have.  As far as "dirty tricks" in campaigning go, this seems pretty minor.Bernie's campaign will explain what happened, maybe someone(s) gets canned or otherwise punished, the glitch will be fixed, and all will go on.It actually is very similar to the Congress/DOD kerfluffle over DOD data that was unintentionally released to the Congress.  Its hard to get too mad at folks when data they aren't supposed to have is dumped in their lap by no fault of their own.</comment>

<comment>Some one already got caned and yes the Sanders campaign will resume it course to obscurity.</comment>

<comment>The Sanders campaign caned one of their own, you say?Hmmm...maybe I'll have to take a second look at Sanders...</comment>

<comment>There is a global shortage of N's. have you not heard?</comment>

<comment>Oh, I had not heard.Is this like when the ancient Hawaiians migrated from Tahiti, and to save weight mid-journey, had to toss "B", "C", "D", "F". "G", "J", "Q", "R", "S", "T", "V" and "Z" overboard?There's also the alternate theory that they ate them, just as they did with the menehunes.</comment>

<comment>If Bernie Sanders had the intent of stealing a list of Hillary Clinton supporters, he could have gone to the New York Public Library and ripped the Yellow Pages out for "Lower Manhattan-Stock Brokers and Hedge Fund Managers."</comment>

<comment>She has enough money to fight the GOP financial onslaught to come? Good. She has my vote.</comment>

<comment>The "onslaught" isn't coming from the GOP.  As Bernie says, we all were led to believe that our society was at risk of being destroyed by Communists.  Instead, it was the Capitalists that trashed our economy, sent our jobs overseas, ruined our portfolios, decimated our housing equity and ruthlessly destroyed our democracy with money in politics.She has "enough money" because the same Capitalists are banking on her to win.  All they need do is donate tons of money and count on idiots like you to vote for her.</comment>

<comment>Oh please. Socialism is just feudalism minus chivalry.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it's Social Security and Medicare, here in America.  You don't like that?</comment>

<comment>brainwashed to repel reason.</comment>

<comment>So, Bernie hired a hacker and he got busted. That was pretty risky. Best just accept the DNC's punishment and try to move on.</comment>

<comment>I thought Hillary had her own server.</comment>

<comment>You misread.Hillary has her own *sewer*.</comment>

<comment>It's kind of like an intra-party Watergate.Data is insecure these days. We need to do all we can to ensure our data is secure.</comment>

<comment>"It's kind of like an intra-party Watergate."This is very funny!!!Good, ironic observation, IMHO.</comment>

<comment>Nathaniel Pearlman is the founder and co-owner of NGP VAN, the company that is in charge of the Democratic National Committee data allegedly breached by Sanders' campaign. Pearlman was chief technology officer for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.Debbie Wasserman Schultz is the chair of the DNC. Wasserman Schultz was campaign co-chair for Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign.The breach has the appearance of being orchestrated by two former high-level Clinton operatives. Even if true, the punishment doesn't fit the staffer's misdeed.</comment>

<comment>There is a horrible, cynical irony at play here...Sanders seems, to me at least, to be one of the few fairly transparent and open candidates: I have very little doubt about what he'd like to do, if given his druthers.But he is being screwed to the wall as a shamelessly unprincipled opportunist, which I do not think he is. Hillary, however, is just that, I believe.So Sanders will get screwed over for being a crook, which he probably is not, and not for being a socialist, which he is.</comment>

<comment>What is happening here is more than it appears to be --- it is a fight not only between Bernie against Clinton, the DNC's neoliberal-con 'D' Vichy party, the neocon 'R' Vichy party, and the media/propaganda-sector of the Empire, but between restorative democracy and Empire in America.What we are actually seeing of necessity is a "Truth and Reconciliation Commission" on America as the metropole of the Disguised Global Capitalist Empire beginning to be exposed and rectified in what will hopefully be a non-violent Second American Revolution against Empire again.I had told Bernie's campaign early this year in Rochester that to come out of this thing, one way or the other, that he would have to address the seminal meta-issue of the cancerous tumor of Empire, and although his NH campaign manager tried to ignore this, it is now turning out to be more of a confrontation than I had imagined.Now that the Clinton and DNC attack on Sanders' truth telling campaign has employed an electronic false-flagged attack reminiscent of Polish soldiers supposedly attacking a German radio outpost or the Gulf of Tonkin attack on the 'Maddox' it is clear to me that Bernie is truly facing the entire force of the Empire --- an Empire which is both truly a Global Empire, more extensively metastasized and deeply hidden than any empire in human history.Bernie's rational, restrained, and non-violent response to this attack by the whole Empire reminds me of Nelson Mandela's resistance and confrontation to the semi-disguised cancer of the apartheid empire in South Africa in which he was initially imprisoned and immobilized (as Bernie was in Congress), and from which the brilliant non-violent response of a 'Truth and Reconciliation Commission' was the peaceful path out of Empire.Since we are just now at the beginning of this path toward full recognition, diagnosis, understanding, exposure, and public 'calling-out' of this cancer of Empire --- which is the cause of all our Maladies and our entire "ailing social order" [Bauman] --- it is not clear yet (except to the youth in college campaigns noted here) what the end point of this Second American Revolution against Empire again will be.As Zygmunt Bauman hauntingly puts it, “In the case of an ailing social order, the absence of an adequate diagnosis…is a crucial, perhaps decisive, part of the disease.”13Berman, Morris (2011-02-07).
