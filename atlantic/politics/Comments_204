<comment>My mother stood on tip toes to get in to the WASPs.  The height requirement was 5'2" and she was just a hair over 5'1".  But she could fly!Walt Disney developed a character for the WASPs, Miss Fifinella.  She was a blonde girl with wings who looked a lot like mom.  If you wanted to make mom smile, all you had to do was call her Miss Fifinella.  She was so proud that she wrangled B-52s just like the men.The WASPs had a song, to warn new recruits.  She sang it to me as a lullaby.  I hope you like it.Zoot-Suits and ParachutesBefore I was a member of the AAFTDI was a working girl in Washington, D.C.My boss he was unkind to me, he worked me night and dayI always had the time to work but never the time to play.(CHORUS)Singing zootsuits and parachutes and wings of silver, tooHe'll ferry airplanes as his mama used to do.Along came a pilot, ferrying a plane,He asked me to go fly with him down in lovers' laneAnd I, like a silly fool, thinking it no harmCuddled in the cockpit to keep the pilot warm.(CHORUS)Early in the morning before the break of dayHe handed me a short-snort bill and this I heard him sayTake this, my darling, for the damage I have done, For you may have a daughter or you may have a son;If you have a daughter, teach her how to fly,If you have a son, put the bastard in the sky.(CHORUS)The moral of this story as you can plainly seeIs never trust a pilot an inch above the knee,He'll kiss you and caress you, and promise to be trueAnd have a girl at every field as all the pilots do.</comment>

<comment>What a great post!</comment>

<comment>You and your yarn collection and crazy yarns. :)</comment>

<comment>Respect Ms. Simpson.  My Mother was a Navy WAVES during WWII, one of the first batch accepted and shared amusing stories and anecdotes of the thrust and parry with sailors.</comment>

<comment>Very enjoyable post.One point: not B-52s. That aircraft (a jet) did not enter service until the 1950s. They're still in use today.</comment>

<comment>I love this song and know it well. The WASP sang it at reunions - with gusto! Who was your mother? And I'll bet she flew B-25s, didn't she? Thanks for your post!</comment>

<comment>Why would the Secretary of the Army deny women who served their due? Has he no shame?</comment>

<comment>I didn't realize there was this discrepancy. Are WACs eligible for burial at Arlington? My grandmother was a WAC (Women's Army Corps) during the Korean War. We'd rather bury here right here in town with us, of course. When the time comes, the inspirational lady is still kicking! Only get to Arlington once or twice a year, after all. But I'm still curious about her eligibility.</comment>

<comment>These brave women pilots are more eligible than the non-serving contiguous family members buried at Arlington. Besides, this case involved a cremation; space is not an issue - continued discrimination is.Many of the top tier WWII female pilots were part of the first space program and passed the NASA and military rigorous physical, mental and skills testing with higher scores than the males that were eventually chosen as astronauts - and with flying colors. Right stuff, wrong gender. We are a worse nation and world when shutting out half the population that is not just equal but sometimes better able to both lead and excel.</comment>

<comment>The WACs were officially a part of the Army during the war so your grandmother should be eligible if she served active duty. You would need her Honorable Discharge and for DD214 to confirm. The WASP were technically civilians during the war despite the fact that the AAF wanted them. They were recognized as veterans in 1977. It is this recognition postwar rather than during the war that is distinguishing them, according to Sec. of Army, as not qualified for Arlington National Cemetery.</comment>

<comment>They were contractors who were not given combat roles.Including them would be making an exception because they were women not the other way around</comment>

<comment>These women should be top of the list to be granted the limited space left at Arlington.</comment>

<comment>More about respect than space as this woman is seeking inurnment and not burial, and the honors that have been granted to them since 2002 by a prior Secretary of the Army and the DOD.  A needless and foolish change of policy at a time when very few are left who might even apply for such honors.  See www.fifinella.com/anc_rights.h... for more information.</comment>

<comment>Should anyone doubt the skill and courage of those, including this particular WASP, who flew this aircraft, including Jimmie Doolittle over the beaches at Normandy, and Richard Bong in the Pacific theatre, please check out the history of the P-38, the test pilots who were killed in it, the work on the modifications that made this a superior fighter, as well as the recovery of "Glacier Gal" from the "Lost Squadron" of P-38s that were attempting to fly to Great Britain.  http://www.popularmechanics.co...</comment>

<comment>These women were prepared to risk their lives for their country and not good enough to be buried alongside the men who died for the same reason. That is an absolute disgrace. We love to talk about our brave fighting men and women yet here we are not giving those women the respect they deserved all those years ago. Shameful.</comment>

<comment>They were ferry pilots NOT military members.</comment>

<comment>In response to some of the comments... the women were not contractors and certainly weren't paid like contractors. They were technically Civil Service. In 1977 Congress and then the Department of Defense determined that they had indeed served and issue Honorable Discharges and DD214s. They did not serve combat. Combat is not a requirement for Arlington National Cemetery. Perhaps it should be, but it is not. Less than 30% of WWII vets saw actual combat.</comment>
