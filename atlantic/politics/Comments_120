<comment>Well.....this may finally hurt him. So little has, but this might. Does anyone else think that his demand that CNN pay $5 million for him to debate sounds like a whiny baby who doesn't want to go to the debate anyway??</comment>

<comment>Jeff Zucker said CNN will not pay Trump anything because it is their policy not to pay those who appear on the network. </comment>

<comment>Good for Zucker! That's the right position to take here, I think.</comment>

<comment>It's not a position, it's a policy. Has nothing to do with Trump, or any of these other jackasses.</comment>

<comment>I hope Trump dispenses with CNN and holds a counter debate via Twitter or something</comment>

<comment>That might hide his utter lack of policy knowledge. You should pass that idea on to his campaign.</comment>

<comment>Then Trump should say BYE BYE!!</comment>

<comment>No. He is asking for it to be donated to the vets. Anything wrong with that? I thought you chaps were against corporations making obscene profits. In any case the so called " winners " Fiorina, Carson yadda yadda have all faded. Trump not participating will blow these nonsensical debates away</comment>

<comment>You have to be touched in the head to believe that...which presumably explains Donald Dump's success in GOP circles.</comment>

<comment>Like Sanders beating Hillary in the Dem debate lol</comment>

<comment> You do understand that a $5m donation to the vets results in a $1.2m reduction of his taxes, assuming he pays taxes, right?</comment>

<comment>Uh, no Trump wants to donate the money he's demanding CNN pay him to vets. Not have CNN pay vets. Big and obvious difference when it comes to taxes.</comment>

<comment>Trump is Robinhood, Bruce Wayne and Tony Stark rolled into one. The rest of the GOP field are the henchmen who get their backsides handed to them. Hillary is Bane and Sanders is the bishop of Lancaster.</comment>

<comment>No.. it sounds like somebody who is sick of showing up with half the MORONS on the stage even having 3% in the POLLS and it is someone who has made MILLIONS for CNN for them to only TRASH him and LIE about him every 5 minutes!! Most people would not go for ANY amount of money... but he is saying give it to the wounded warriors!! I guess he feels he would MUCH rather see them have it then the GREEDY LIARS at CNN!!</comment>

<comment>I see you are drinking the kool-aid.</comment>

<comment>Listen buddy. Our government really cares about the people they send to get their arms and legs blown off and their faces melted off.They care so much that an organization exists that has commercials on TV that asks us to pay for the treatment of the people they send to get their arms and legs blown off and their faces melted off.Pfft.</comment>

<comment>And then the government asks those that they sent, and those that they will send, to take a little cut in pay, maybe close a  PX or two, cut Tri Care a bit, so that Boeing and their ilk can keep selling more war chit to the government.</comment>

<comment>A bit of an exaggeration. Uncle Sam provides very good care to the wounded. (I live near Walter Reed and know Marines and sailors treated there.) Gifts to charity aren't needed for medical treatment. Gifts are used primarily for support for their families and for benefits that aid their rehab and accommodate special needs. (And those organizations that advertise on TV can be outright or borderline scams.)</comment>

<comment>I was refering to wounded warrior project</comment>

<comment>So was I. </comment>

<comment>So was I. </comment>

<comment>It should not need to exist.</comment>

<comment>WWP does not do what you think it does.  Read their website and look them up on Charity Navigator.  They certainly don't provide direct medical care to active duty soldiers and Marines. As I said, Uncle Sam does that.By the way, last year, WWP raised over $312,000,000 and spent $150,000,000 on "Program".  They spent $99,000,000 on fundraising.  And WWP spent $94,000,000 on nothing at all.  They raised far more than what they use and have for several years.  I don't think they need the Donald's $5,000,000.</comment>

<comment>Check out how each year it's a new record of veteran suicides. Must be all the SSRI's that are pumped in to them from the VA.</comment>

<comment>My post was about care for wounded being provided  through military hospitals, not by charity. That has nothing to do with VA. Those are very different things.</comment>

<comment>I was on the fence on this issue, but your use of caps lock convinced me. Wow!! I'm sold now!!</comment>

<comment>CNN should raise a bar and offer him 10 million for not showing up. I'll bet other candidates would pitch in.</comment>

<comment>I could go for that!</comment>

<comment>no one would watch</comment>

<comment>The probability of him being assassinated has drastically increased, all of a sudden. Not sure how many of his supporters will care though. Most of the Israel-first crowd is with Cruz, Rubio or Carson already. </comment>

<comment>thats cause those guys like the snipped tips</comment>

<comment>You like them uncut?</comment>

<comment>what does that mean?</comment>

<comment>unsnipped.</comment>

<comment>youll have to excuse me, my verbal IQ is breddy low</comment>

<comment>Wow he won't cuck to Israel, and that will hurt him? Are you kidding? That's going to help him HUGE</comment>

<comment>In a general election maybe, not in a Republican primary</comment>

<comment>NOT PAY HIM! The 5 million dollars where going to charity to help the vets. This is why people don't trust the media. They mislead people.</comment>

<comment>Calm down, Trunpette  I know what he demanded. And didn't get </comment>

<comment>HmmmThe reason Bill Q's comment is so cogent isn't that you know what he demanded. It is so cogent because as a result of the zionist main stream media continually slandering him the majority of the voters DON"T KNOW THAT. All they see and hear is that Trump was trying to extort money from CNN for himself. And his demand does beg the question: why should CNN which is a private for profit corporation be allowed to profit handsomely from his presence without compensation to him? Do you work for free?In point of fact Bill Q's comment worth repeating again and again. Your obvious attempt to undermine its importance  not withstanding.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who isn't a low information voter would know that none of the networks compensate debaters, nor make contributions on their behalf, ever. Trump was asking for unique and special treatment,  and got slapped down. He deserves it.</comment>

<comment>HmmmThere is no denying these "debates" generate a huge financial windfall for the networks. And the fact that it hasn't been done in the past, is hardly justification on either moral or ethical grounds not to change. It seems to me that Trumps idea was far more equitable. As it stands now the Networks are primary beneficiaries of these debates. They also often fail to serve the best interests of the voters by failing to conduct honest, unbiased debates. They intentional structure the debates to favor one candidate or another. They also have a real knack for making sure the most important issues of the day are not covered during the debates.  Obviously charities don't get a dime of the networks windfall profits. And the candidates themselves get screwed twice unless they happen to be  a favorite of the network. They don't get paid, and they don't get equitable treatment during the debates. And obviously Trump is no favorite of CNN. And the fact remains that the MSM has gone out of its way to misrepresent Trumps intentions on this issue by often failing to mention that he intended the money go to charity .So I have to disagree with you. I believe it is your commentary that displays obvious ignorance. And given your childish unprovoked personal attack it is hard to discern whether it was willful or not.........</comment>

<comment>You vile liberal scum Donald Trump said that he should be given $5 million which would be given to the Wounded Soldiers chariety, and why shouldn't he, CNN will make $20 million from that debate and most of that earnings will be because Trump is at the debate. If you going to tell a story tell the whole story you pathetic douche bag.</comment>

<comment>I don't think it will, or at least not in the way Rubio hopes. Maybe it would have it were in July, but Trump's inertia is too much for any once incident to deflect in the course of a couple of weeks now. Besides, the neoconservatives and Adelson are not held in high esteem by the base(and they can tell that they are immediately jumping on Trump here), and Trump is "strong" enough on Israel that he could probably get away with this. Trump isn't proposing that we side with the Palestinians or anything like that, and they know it.Now, something that CAN deflate him if blown up enough lies elsewhere: he has a senior advisor with ties to Semyon Mogelivich. That's huge, especially given Putin's connections with him. Discrediting him won't work because the people trying to do so are discredited themselves. Legal processes might.</comment>

<comment>HEY!I like those things and I'm not in any of those groups.You make them sound like bad things, but they are good things - except the part about hating Muslims or anyone else, which is a bad thing.</comment>

<comment>So he's an equal opportunity offender?  </comment>

<comment>Hahahah. Bullshit.</comment>

<comment>That was freaking funny! LOL</comment>

<comment>The whole Republican Jewish Coalition was offended by this?  I'm amazed both members were there at the same time to hear it!Jokes aside, the Jewish vote went 69-30 in 2012 for Obama, the supposed worst President for Jews ever.  If that's what the Democrats get with a candidate who supposedly hates Israel, what is the point of the Israel pandering by Republicans?  The Jewish vote isn't going Republican, so why spend so much energy having a race to see who can be the most slavishly devoted to Israel?I'm a Republican who is hardly a Zionist.  Apparently the Republican Party hasn't quite heard about the recently released Jonathan Pollard, but many Republicans consider him the perfect symbol of U.S.-Israeli relations.  Israel gets massive amounts of foreign aid (the largest recipient country, by far), military aid, protection, and an unwavering commitment from the U.S.  We've squandered trillions of dollars advancing Israeli interests, and for what?  What return has the U.S. gotten on this investment?  What are the Israelis willing to do for us, other than steal our government secrets?Trump found another kernel of truth within his bloviating.  I certainly won't fault him for it.</comment>

<comment>Evangelicals.Or more explicitly, Evangelicals with their weird apocalyptic beliefs about the importance of Jewish Israel to the Christian Armageddon.</comment>

<comment>Specifically, evangelicals with Dominionist tendencies; and there are plenty of those in the Republican party.</comment>

<comment>And you know what the Dominionist interpretation of Revelation has in store for (all but 144,000?) Jews.</comment>

<comment>Cruz. He's a dominionist. Folks thought rev wright was scary...they ought to get a load of the cruzs religious beliefs. </comment>

<comment>Very true! They are way out there.</comment>

<comment>I always thought it was because Jews were enemies of Islam, and Evangelicals are also against Islam. Enemy of my enemy and all that.</comment>

<comment>That's more recent, and bled into evangelicalism from other far-right groups.</comment>

<comment>There may be some of that, but for much of Evangelical Christianity, the support of Israel is largely because it (the country, not the people) plays a pivotal role in their eschatology.  (Their obsession with bring about divine armageddon is oddly consonant with the similar motivations of ISIS.)</comment>

<comment>Republicans have always coveted the Jewish vote, or more accurately, the Jewish checkbook.  Evangelicals dont care about that, but the politicians certainly do.Evangelicals have an odd relationship with Judaism because the formation and then the destruction of Israel is central to end days prophecy.  They don't necessarily care about Judaism or Jews itself, but they're very concerned about the state called Israel.Both of these considerations predate Islamic terrorism by a century or more.But I'm sure that 9/11 "clarified" the issue for some people (even though we, and Israel, are allied to Saudi Arabia, from whence al Qaeda sprang).</comment>

<comment>Oh no- "god gave Israel to the Jews" and "The temple must be rebuilt so Christ can return"  are two of the most common, if wackiest beliefs among pseudo-christians like the Seventh Day Adventists and Southern BaptistsIts heresy in Catholicism but that's a different story</comment>

<comment>Part of it is donors too. Sheldon Adelson is the biggest overall GOP donor. Rubio also has a wealthy jewish backer in Norman Brahman,  so they're under pressure obviously. Trump doesn't have that problem. </comment>

<comment>Which puts him in an exclusive class of his own.</comment>

<comment>Yep, Trump is a bold guy. He is playing people but still he is better than all the other no good pols</comment>

<comment>I can't get over the fact that you are 100% correct, or that someone with no experience or knowledge of governance and no policy stances is by far the best Republican candidate.</comment>

<comment>What is 30% of 2% of the population?Votes? I think the "support" is defined in terms of media influence.</comment>

<comment>Israel is way, way, way down on the list of foreign aid recipients. Nato, Saudi Arabia, Japan, South Korea all get way, way more.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it's at the top. Why lie about something that is so easily checked?http://abcnews.go.com/Politics...http://beta.foreignassistance....</comment>

<comment>No moron. The US defending Europe from Russia, Saudi Arabia from Saddam and Iran, South Korea from the lunatics in the North, Japan from China all are foreign aid, all cost far more than $3 very very very large and all put American lives on the line. Israel only gets subsidized weapons and no American blood.Try again.</comment>

<comment>I just provided a link to the actual .gov site on foreign aid.You're making a dishonest argument to try and obfuscate the simple fact by claiming, without any sort of attempt at objectivity or accuracy, that you can just inflate the numbers based in what seems like a half-understood version of the "free rider" problem.Just FYI, Israel is a "free rider" just as much as any of those. But thanks for so quickly discrediting yourself by posting an easily disproven lie.</comment>

<comment>No idiot. I'm redefining "foreign aid" in a much more realistic way. Yes, I know very well that the cash going to Israel is more than other countries, but that is a stupid way of thinking about what constitutes foreign aid, _even though it is the legal definition_. The US aids other countries much, much more than it aids Israel in money and blood.Those troops in the Gulf aren't defending the US in any way shape or form.But what can you expect of a troll that thinks UN Resolutions mean anything more than dead trees and wasted bandwidth.</comment>

<comment>"Facts I disagree with are stupid and need to be changed to suit my political ideology". Yeah, no. I'm not buying that. There's no way to accurately calculate your supposedly superior metric, and coming from an ideologue like you it's inherently suspect. You do not act in good faith or with honesty.Where is the rest of your posse of fools? I see now why you always hide in packs; you look so alone and illogical on your own.</comment>

<comment>You are up against a Zionist Jewish casuist of the calibre of Dershowitz. Better give up.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, we're just uppity dhimmis these days who don't know our place anymore. Our success just points out the utter failure of Arab society. I understand, it's hard to jibe with the glorious past of 1000 years ago.If your pathetic culture ever decides to value success over revenge, you guys may actually contribute something positive to the world. Why don't you give it a try?</comment>

<comment>Ah look, and now his racist shtick comes out as well.</comment>

<comment>There's nothing racist about pointing out the failures of cultures. C'mon scholar, tell me of an Arab living under an Arab regime who produced something the rest of the world wanted since that guy who kind of invented sociology in the 1300's."I don't play those racist games" will be your response.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I'm just going to flag your comments and hope others do the same. I flagged the real anti-Semites here, and yet you slime still slur me as an anti-Semite. You're the exact same sort of bigoted trash as them, so I'll treat you the same.I hope you have a bad day. You really deserve it.</comment>

<comment>What, you're not going to wish death and suffering upon me? Ye gods below, what have you sunk to man? No curses for me? I'm hurt tateleh. Aren't I worth it?</comment>

<comment>No. You're not worth it. You're a pathetic angry old man spewing racism on the internet in service of your hate ideology. A dime a dozen.</comment>

<comment>Haven't you been banned like, 5 times or so so far?</comment>

<comment>Nah, OMG has been a Jew hater for a long time.  These latest comments are nothing new for him.</comment>

<comment>You are mendacious and petulant to boot. Your success is only visible in your expert grasp of 'Goebbelsian' principles'. Repeat something often enough and ..... .I suggest you read a few Jewish historians to learn how the Muslims kept the Jewry alive.</comment>

<comment>So tateleh, prove me wrong. Tell me of some Arab living under an Arab regime who produced something the rest of the world wants since the Mongol invasion. The faux-Irishman told me once of a guy living in Morocco in the 1300's who invented sociology. I guess that's an accomplishment.I put out a falsifiable assertion. Falsify it and I'll take it back.It's been 800 years of failure. Time to stop blaming others.</comment>

<comment>For once I agree with you. When one's exertions in order to keep the Jewish people alive while all others were striving to cook their goose results in the fullness of time in the birth of an ingrate like you, then it must have all been in vain.</comment>

<comment>Ingrate? Huh?You don't refute me because you can't.Anyways, you and your societies are utter failures. Your only hope of making any kind of better life is to capitulate to the fact that the Jews are no longer dhimmis, the Land between the River and the Sea will be forever controlled by Jews, and Jerusalem Ir haKodesh will never again be Al-Quds. Then, maybe, just maybe, you could escape the trap of honor and resentment and hatred that keeps you backwards and failures.</comment>

<comment>And besides, there were a few periods of tolerance, but other than that, Jews lived as miserable dhimmis under Arab rule; it's only good compared to the savagery of the Europeans.</comment>

<comment>The ironic thing is that the vision that Arab liberals put forth during the failed Spring was basically Israel.</comment>

<comment>you are disgusting.  Full of hate.  No redeeming value</comment>

<comment>Did I say anything not true?</comment>

<comment>It is dead easy to calculate my superior metric. Money spent and lives lost and destroyed. Only pool boys with delusions of scholarship find that hard to understand.</comment>

<comment>You should demand a refund from wherever you went to college, because you clearly got ripped off. That comment is hilariously ignorant. No one, and I mean no one, with any experience would accepted that half-assed cobbled together but of partisan nonsense you just tried to toss out.Keep trolling. You got caught lying here. Maybe you should go back to your echo chamber. I'm sure they'll promptly hail your anti-intellectual posturing as genius.</comment>

<comment>How is adding up the money given to A and adding up the money and lives spent and ruining doing B a lie? That's basic accounting.No, it just points out that you are a pathetic Jew-hater trying oh so desperately to feed us to the ISIS equivalents in Gaza.</comment>

<comment>It's actually not, which is why you're being such a defensive troll about it. Apparently you have some shriveled shred of honestly left.Comparing Hamas to Daesh? Lovely. Thanks for again proving your ignorance and utter lack of intellect. Go back to your racist arguments about Arabs.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely valid comparison, aside from some trivial theological differences. Pancreatic vs. lung cancer.</comment>

<comment>A completely invalid one, and even the Israeli military agrees with me. There is no valid comparison between them at all. But no amount of inaccuracy or bigotry can possibly bother such an immoral person.http://972mag.com/no-hamas-isn...</comment>

<comment>Here's a quote from that article:"Just to be clear, I know very well that Hamas is a brutal, dictatorial organization; the term “Islamofascist” is indeed descriptive of its character. So in that limited sense, it’s the same as ISIS."The difference is that Israel and Egypt prevent Hamas from acting like ISIS; were they to ease up on their oppression, Hamas would certainly equal ISIS in their barbarity.So, tateleh, the only real difference is the amount of opposition each faces.</comment>

<comment>Read the rest of it you dishonest troll.I take it  back. You don't even have the shriveled shred of honesty or integrity left. You replaced it with your hate ideology.</comment>

<comment>I did. The rest of it was silly. All theoretical questions with the wrong answers.Why don't you check out Memri.org and see for yourself Hamas's ISIS wannabee fantasies?</comment>

<comment>MEMRI is not a credible group. Want to link me to any other far-right groups that serve to shill for the Israeli government? How about StandWithUs? Or the JDL?It wasn't silly. It was factual. I can see why a deranged troll would get those confused though. Your experience with facts must be limited.</comment>

<comment>Why isn't it credible? Do you speak Arabic? or Persian?</comment>

<comment>Because it was founded explicitly to promote Israel. It's a hasbara site. They've been caught mistranslating and other dishonest behaviors to serve their propaganda goal.That'd be like me linking to Electronic Intifada. Worse actually, since EF doesn't have explicit ties to the Palestinian government.</comment>

<comment>What is wrong with Jews defending themselves? That is, after all, all that "hasbara" is.Any links to someone credible who caught them mistranslating? People I know who do actually speak Arabic have vouched for their accuracy.</comment>

<comment>People you know, meaning other extremist partisans? I'm sure they have.Jews don't get to lie and create propaganda and get a pass. No one does. It's not about being Jewish, it's about lying. Not that you mendacious fools that spend your free time shilling for the government online care. Propaganda is just patriotism to you right?</comment>

<comment>You've never, ever have caught me in a lie. Ever.</comment>

<comment>Funny how many different definitions of "hasbara" Zionists seem to have, depending on what they're trying to prove/disprove.  That shifting of goalposts is characteristic of hasbara itself, as practiced by salaried employees of the Zionist state.</comment>

<comment>And Irgun Terrorists blowing up hotels in Palestine with Israeli "Defence" Force blowing up Palestinian apartment blocks?</comment>

<comment>didnt you repeat this insult twice?</comment>

<comment>I've repeated it many times.I do apologize to pool boys around the world, mean them no disrespect comparing them to this idiot SJW...</comment>

<comment>Don't worry, PP. We all know Zionism is a racial superiority movement. Considering most Israelis trace their family tree back to Europe, which race is it that you believe to be superior?Bear in mind that Judaism is a religion, not a race.</comment>

<comment>Actually, most Israeli Jews trace their family tree back to Arab countries, not Europe, not that that matters to a Jew-hater like you. And BTW, FWIW, my Orthodox Jewish wife is Korean and I have an interracial daughter.So yes, I know very, very well that Judaism is a religion and a nation, but not a race.</comment>

Who's next, Hitler?But to correct your ignorance, very few Israeli Jews trace ancestry directly to Spain. However, about 800K Arab Jews were ethnically cleansed by their Arab Muslim neighbors; the Ashkenazi Zionist pioneers took them in and made them citizens. Baghdad, for example, used to be about half Jewish. Now there are no Iraqi Jews left at all, the Babylonian exile is over.</comment>

<comment>Not many. Read Mark Twain on his travels to Palestine. It was a sh1t hole, and it continued being a sh1t hole until the Jews arrived in force.Looking back on it now, B"H it was Arabs who squatted in Palestine during the exile.

Jews dare to not be victims, they dare to defend themselves and it bothers the p1ss out of you. All you want is for us to be pathetic victims again. Sorry dude, not so easy to fock with Jews anymore and we're not going back.Better your condemnation than your sympathy--Golda Meir.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, because no racist has ever married an Asian girl.  Spare me your weak Hasbara, Ziotroll.  If you're like most Zios, you wait until the Ethiopian Jew leaves schul so you can talk shit behind his back.  Maybe have a word with the Israli minister who called Sudanese people "a cancer", putz.</comment>

<comment>Tell that to my non-white wife and my interracial child. Moron.No sir, you are the racist here.</comment>

<comment>Hmm, is your non-white wife also non-Jewish? Because you must be aware that the Book of Ezra would have you abandon both your wife and your child if your wife isn't Jewish.There's a whole bunch of evil BS in the Old Testament, and that "commandment" is a prime example of it. But you keep studying it and believing it, you of the "Chosen" people.</comment>

<comment>LOL. My Korean-born wife is a Righteous Convert, as Jewish as Sarah Silverman and Jerry Seinfeld.You've never read the "Old Testament" (hint, it's not its name) and you have no idea what's in it.</comment>

<comment>Only God is righteous, Whom your Khazar ancestors impaled on Golgotha for Roman gold...just as your satanic cult psychosis, Gog, yet seeks with Babylon to enslave and crucify True Zion, America.Repent.</comment>

<comment>Hey Atlantic, isn't it time to ban this lunatic already?</comment>

<comment>You are a very bad representative of your religion and your people.</comment>

<comment>Why do you say that?</comment>

<comment>I say that because your posts are creating ill will towards Jews and Judaism and that is the last thing you should want to do. </comment>

<comment>Why do my posts create ill will towards Jews and Judaism?</comment>

<comment>Read them. You are a smart man. You can figure it out. Adios.</comment>

<comment>Read them? I wrote them.I was only messing with you, see if you would be honest about hating Jews and Judaism. I guess not.</comment>

<comment>That you would even type that word is both heinous and unsurprising, given your views on European racial superiority.  Which part of AmeriKK Ka did you say you hail from again, Ziotroll?</comment>

<comment>No Zionist can be American, for America alone is God's prophesied "Zion" - as foretold now under attack by the false-Jew Khazar Christ-killers' "Synagogue of Satan" ("Gog") and the Roman Anti-Christ ("Babylon").</comment>

<comment>He openly admits the cult psychosis taught from birth to members of the "Synagogue of Satan," "Gog," prophesied to attack and usurp "Israel," (viz. America) with their ancient partners of the Roman Anti-Christ (viz. "Babylon") for whom their false-Jew Khazar ancestors performed, for Roman gold, tens of thousands of impalements on Christs and Immanuel, God Incarnate (prophesied by the Hebrews), for twice being convicted of "sedition" under codified Roman law - to deny Caesar was God.They then went on to do the "MBA" work running, for Rome's satanic ruling false-elite, the "Wall Street of slavery" for over 2,000 years, at Rome.They now perform the same function for Rome, now seeking to crucify True Zion, America, just as they crucified The Christ before.</comment>

<comment>Be careful. The term "fascist" has become as meaningless as "antisemite" and "politically correct."True fascists, after all, tended to be Catholic.</comment>

<comment>Today the true fascists can only be found among the Jewish people - the zionists.</comment>

<comment>genius. did you go to Harvard?</comment>

<comment>Why? They are there too?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I don't want to be a pathetic victim. F me man, f me.</comment>

<comment>I also killed Jesus. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>Ah, so once you disagree with something then its not real?You would have made a great accountant for the mafia.Unfortunately for your argument, dollars spent are real costs.  That they show up under the line of the US military doesn't mean we aren't aiding these countries.Make sure you get someone else to do your taxes otherwise the IRS might want to have a word with you.</comment>

<comment>Accountant for the Mafia? I thought they had enough Judaic ones for that. What with Mr Lansky and others! You speaking from inside knowledge?</comment>

<comment>You're watching too many movies on HBO, OMG.Try again.BTW, you do realize that Lansky has been dead and buried for over 30 years.  I know keeping up with modern history is a challenge, but seriously.</comment>

<comment>I find it funny that this troll asked you about your posse. He was losing a battle to me on another page and asked me to stop writing to him.  I did, yet was curious how he handled himself with others. Similar.  He gave links to me too that were irrelevant in supporting his point.  Entertaining if not so scary. </comment>

<comment>He's quite delusional, but he really can ruin a discussion.</comment>

<comment>He works hard to maintain his illusions, hence his request for me to stop writing to him - it was too hard for him to answer simple questions without cracking.  You and John Jett seem to do a good job (not that it will budge people like Naidm, but it will hopefully to those reading who are forming opinions).</comment>

<comment>You're not the first person he has made that comment to, nor are you likely to be the last.  Don't sweat it too much.  He will also likely claim at some point that he will ignore you and never write back again - that promise usually lasts until the next post.</comment>

<comment>Welcome to Roid world.  He is TA's SJW supreme - but has no problem voicing his hatred of Jews.</comment>

<comment>Thank you.  Nice to see some friendlies here.  Naidm does try to mask his hatred of Jews with a few snow flakes here and there - but they melt quickly - sadly, not before he is content with himself.I am too well versed with similar trolls in varying degrees on JPost.  I used to post there regularly but they just got rid of disqus and replaced it with an inferior substitute.  Checkin' out this 'hood;-)</comment>

<comment>Aww, Naidm isn't such a bad guy, once you get past his inflexible, high-handed self-righteousness and condescension.Other'n that, he's a real sweetheart.</comment>

<comment>I'm kinda likin' it here. :P</comment>

<comment>*touches brim of Stetson, nods almost imperceptibly*</comment>

<comment>A little cryptic, but I think I get it...</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the neighborhood and enjoy.JPost stopped using disqus?  Didn't notice that.  It's a shame because it's a good system.  Ability to edit, and comments get posted in real time rather than hours later like Ha'Aretz used to do.Unfortunately, its difficult to have serious discussions with a number of posters and some threads more than others bring out the looney bin.Roid is special though because he lets his emotional SJW pedestal get in the way of any rational discussion.  He is like Billy Joel's proverbial "Angry Young Man".</comment>

<comment>I thought I recognized your avatar - but maybe a different moniker from JPost?  But that wouldn't make sense because I'm thinking of that when it was using disqus at the time.Ha'Aretz vets comments before putting them on.  I always stay within the realm of rules and respect and they only allowed for a tiny portion of my comments to appear.  What a farce.  They employ the likes of David Sheen who has outright lied and been called on it - and yet he still keeps his job there.  I have no patience for people who deliberately lie to forward their agenda - and less so when they lie to themselves.  Papers that only print the opinions of those they agree with are also out the window for me.Thanks for the welcome.  I know that disqus is a time sink - one I am more than happy to contribute to - with caution.</comment>

<comment>I've been using Jacob Blues as a screen name for roughly 15 years now across all discussion boards.  For about a year I used the moniker Blues Brother on a board that is now long defunct, but this name is much better for several reasons, most notably its an actual name.Ha'aretz editors didn't really vet much and given what they do find acceptable, points to either some very warped thinking on the part of their moderators or just people who prefer to take coffee breaks for hours on end.There were times when you literally needed to pound them over the head with your comments, and then a whole flood of back and forth's would pop up - including EVERYONE's claim that they alone, and not their ideological opposite was getting blackballed.  In fact, a bunch of us got fed up with the glitches and for a while had an interesting talkback discussion board, which unfortunately fell apart after a year or two.Now though with the pay-wall, its just not worth it.  Their articles aren't much different than can be found on ynet or Times of Israel and their op-ed department took a nose dive off a cliff after 2008 following Akiva Eldar's brain dent myopia.</comment>

<comment>atlantic is now a substitute for the JPost?</comment>

<comment>I'm guessing they both initially commissioned disqus independently.But you can conclude whatever works for your narrative.</comment>

<comment>no what I'm saying is that JPost and Atlantic are not equivalent are they?  One that reads the JPost seems to have a different world view POSSIBLY than one reading the Atlantic.  So I was confused as to why you came here.  Thats all</comment>

<comment>What I've seen in posts, whether or not they were generated by disqus, is that readers who contribute to them hold an abundance of "world views" or opinions/passions.Would you say that all contributors to the Atlantic have identical world views?  From what I've seen - they do not - and that is the same with JPost.  I wouldn't assume that anyone who reads from a news site, reads from that news site exclusively - though some people might be narrow about where they get their news from.In any case, I personally read articles from the Atlantic M much more than I post within them.  I posted months ago and it didn't stick for me.  JPost has a smaller neighborhood (readership) and so it is easier to "kick the ball around" and run into the same people - trolls and friendlies - informed and uninformed.  Of course JPost news is primarily limited to news about the Jewish people, Israel or like matters.  But most people who I know who are interested in those topics - tend to have other interests as well.Imagine that;-)</comment>

<comment>"The US aids other countries much, much more than it aids Israel in money and blood."Bull. The Bush Regime went into Iraq - spending trillions - partly on the desires  of greedy oil types and partly on the desires of "Israel is my spiritual homeland" Jewish NeoCons like Pearle and Wolfowitz.</comment>

<comment>Dude. Not all Jews are Israelis. Those guys were and are American.Don't blame Israel for that.</comment>

<comment>Blame Israel for what? I was pointing out that we spent a ton of money "defending Israel" so we can add that to the aid that we give Israel, pushing them way beyond Korea or any other place that gets American troops. The Iraq war has cost trillions.</comment>

<comment>Dude, Israel is not to blame for the idiocy of the Bush administrations invading Iraq. That was the US's fault, and the US's fault only.</comment>

<comment>We spent a fortune on the military to support Israel. They get the most "foreign aid" by far. That includes the definition of foreign aid, and your definition.</comment>

<comment>Like I said below, Israel is not to blame for the 2 Iraq fiascos. In fact, getting rid of Saddam was the worst thing any American President ever did to Israel.</comment>

<comment>Like I said, we did them partly to protect Israel. It was part of Israel's foreign aid. We give them so much more than just their annual welfare payment.</comment>

<comment>No, no one really knows why Bush II invaded Iraq. If we did it to protect Israel (not that I think so), that's not Israel's fault.But that doesn't matter to you, does it.</comment>

<comment>Fault? Why are you talking about fault? We spend a military fortune because of Israel which you want to call foreign aid. And that's fine - just make sure you put Israel at the top of your self-made "foreign aid" list.</comment>

<comment>We spend nothing to defend Israel. Nothing. We give them $3 billion to help them defend themselves. Not Iraq, not 9/11, not Kuwait, nothing.Listen a$$hole, we're not pathetic victims any more and never will be again. Go f yourself.</comment>

<comment>Without Israel no 9/11. Without 9/11 no multi-trillion dollar Iraq fiasco and ISIS. Israel has cost the United States a huge amount  of "foreign aid".</comment>

<comment>Idiot. Read what Bin Laden wrote in 1998.But that doesn't matter for someone who sympathizes with fascist murderers.</comment>

<comment>Bin Laden gave the Israeli occupation of Palestinians as one of his top reasons for 9/11.</comment>

<comment>It was an afterthought, a sop. His real passion was the infidels on Arabian soil.</comment>

<comment>Israel manages to play the victim regardless of what US does. It's all leverage for AIPAC et al. come the next election...</comment>

<comment>Why would you lie about something so easily confirmed? Israel is the recipient of more US foreign aid than the next two countries down the list, Egypt and Afghanistan, combined.Maybe it has something to do with the high rate of schizophrenia among Ashkenazi Jews? LOL</comment>

<comment>You have a very narrow definition of foreign aid. Mine is a better definition.But I guess you don't care about Americans dying for no good reason.</comment>

<comment>There is no other country on earth that US gives $3B a year to ***in any form***.  You're a liar.  Period.</comment>

<comment>$3 very very very large in cash, yes, Israel is the biggest recipient of cash gifts (though it's really subsidies to US defense contractors). But sorry moron, to only look at cash is stupid, particularly when American lives are at stake defending Saudi tyrants.But you just hate Jews, can't stand that we're not pathetic victims any more. Tough.</comment>

<comment>Actually, US "aid" to Israel comes in the form of military equipment and funding for its development. But hey, keep pretending that the victims are the ones with fighter jets and tanks,a nd the aggressors are the ones DEFENDING their land from invasion with rocks, steak knives and rockets that rarely kill a soul.P.S. Before the 20th century, JEWS (of which you aren't truly one) lived by the word of God, which explicitly forbade "Israel" until the coming of Meshiach. Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism.</comment>

<comment>No, we're not victims anymore. And sure as sh1t don't want to be again. And I've got no problem with Jews preventing those who want to genocide us from doing so.The Palestinians attempted genocide and failed, and got expelled, just like the Germans, just like the Serbs in Albania. Palestinians dream of one day finally getting to drive the Jews into the Sea, the fact that they are incompetent is both good and no excuse for their evil.Finally, I really am enjoying your Torah drashas. Tell me tateleh, where did you go to Yeshiva? Could you even tell me the first sentence in the Bible? Bwahahahaha....</comment>

<comment>"We" who? Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism, so you cannot possibly mean Jews. Maybe you mean the American wingnut Christians that your political movement have duped into believing otherwise?Never mind. You're rubbish, and it's garbage day. To the curb with you!</comment>

<comment>Where do you get this Zionism has nothing to do with Judaism? You do know we pray 3 times a day for the restoration of the Davidic Monarchy and the Rebuilding of the Temple, don't you?Where did you learn in Yeshiva btw?</comment>

<comment>Zion is only what Isaiah says it is and only America is Zion.Those who deny prophecy deny God and are not Jews.</comment>

<comment>LOL...I bet you can't tell me the first sentence in the Bible...</comment>

<comment>There is no private interpretation of prophecy: Only America, as prophesied now under attack by Gog's Christ-killing "Synagogue of Satan" Khazars and Rome, the Risen Babylon, fulfills Isaiah's half-dozen interlocking prophesies of "Israel Restored."Atheist Herzl's and Vatican banker-catspaw Rothschilds' slaughterers of the innocent, White-slaving, sex- and organ-trafficking, USS Liberty-attacking, 9/11-committing tribal racist Organized Crime Capital of the world, the "State of Israel" meets not a singe one.</comment>

<comment>You're too much man. So, Mr. Prophecy expert, can you tell me what is the first sentence in the Bible?</comment>

<comment>You are no Jew; but Satan's Spawn of Uz-ben-Shem.</comment>

<comment>You've never read the Bible in your life, not a single word, and you tell me what's in it. Ok tateleh.BTW, it was me, I killed Jesus. Sorry, didn't know the trouble it would cause, but you've got to admit, he had it coming.</comment>

<comment>Causeless the curse shall not come. Isaiah also prophesied the coming of Immanuel. Repent, for Christ Immanuel is God Incarnate and the Beast you now ride shall soon be cast down, praise God.</comment>

<comment>You do know that Isaiah 7:14 refers to King Chizkyahu, not Yashke, don't you?</comment>

<comment>You'd do well to leave Zion and meet the fate in store for you in the "State of Israel." America is only for God and Americans.</comment>

<comment>You realize dude that I'm more American than you, don't you?</comment>

<comment>God is America's Sovereign. You deny prophecy and God and call yourself "Jew" therefore you are a false-Jew Talmud Khazar Christ-killer of the "Synagogue of Satan," Gog, a follower of the fully accursed atheist Herzl, and no American - or Jew - whatsoever. Your "team's" time is running out in True Zion. You'd do well to be gone.</comment>

<comment>I already told you dude that I killed Jesus. But I deny no Prophecy from True Prophets whatsoever.But thanks, you've been great entertainment.</comment>

<comment>The Hebrew Isaiah is a true prophet of God, to Whom you are abomination.</comment>

<comment>I betcha don't even know his real name.But it's been fun. I'll leave you with this: if Jesus is lord, then I happily condemn my soul to eternal damnation. I'd deny him then and I'd deny him now. Luckily for me, he's spending eternity boiling in a vat of sh1t...</comment>

<comment>Christ Immanuel, Whom you admit to having impaled for Roman gold, was God Incarnate's Manifestation to secure the miracle of "physical" Creation of sentient beings capable of communing with the Creator of the universe, the perfect, infinite, eternal, living, present, ineffable, invisible, holy, righteous, and unique, God Almighty, the God of Abraham, Issac, Moses, Isaiah, Adam Smith, and Thomas Jefferson - anointed by the One God as True Zion's Founder, a prophet of God.</comment>

<comment>Are you a bot? Cuz dude, you are one fantastic troll...</comment>

<comment>As an American only God is my Sovereign, under Truth and Justice alone. You are neither American nor Jew. You are of the Synagogue of Satan, with all other "Zionist" Khazars of the Roman Anti-Christ.</comment>

<comment>My passport says otherwise.It must really irk you that real Americans like Jews more than they like the likes of you. Watching Adam Sandler sing about Chanukah must really frost your tuches, huh? All those Frum Jews out and proud? Proving that Jesus wasn't the Messiah after all? Heh...</comment>

<comment>It is treason to teach one's children, as you and Sandler were raised, that all Black, White, Red, Yellow, and Brown Americans are "sub-human animals," "Goyim," "a mindless herd of cattle" your duty is "to lie to, cheat, rob, enslave, and kill, with impunity."You are doomed and no longer to be tolerated by God's sovereign People. Get out while you can.Over the millennia you false-Jews have been "invited out" of dozens of countries...soon America shall be added to the rather long list.Read prophecy and know God's truth. Come out of Gog and repent; or else you shall be departing true Israel, America.</comment>

<comment>You pray for it because GOD is supposed to bring it about.  You know, the same God that told you to take a hike from Eretz Yisroel for being disobedient little Jews.  Zionism (a modern political movement) is a short-circuiting of the will of God.  But you surely knew that.Nuts to you, troll. We don't all get paid to type online.</comment>

<comment>And, H"K"B IS bringing it about. Check out Rav Kook and learn something. Sorry, but the Satmar Rebbe and those NK a$$holes are wrong.You know, if you're going to argue Torah with me, you can at least learn how to read Hebrew.But boy, it sure does bother you that you can't torment us anymore, doesn't it? Those Jews kicking a$$ and taking names just makes the world feel upside down, no?I don't get paid to type online either.</comment>

<comment>To be a Jew one must love God and seek holiness and righteousness. Zionism's inventor was an avowed, and commensurately accursed, atheist. Those who follow Herzl are not, and cannot be, Jews.Zion is only what the prophet Isaiah says it is and Vatican banker Rothschilds' Organized Crime Capital, the "State of Israel," meets not a single one of his several interlocking prophesies...while America meets each and every one.Those who deny prophecy, for which there is no private interpretation, deny God, America's only Sovereign.</comment>

<comment>You are clearly using too broad a definition of "foreign aid". And since we asked them not to join us in going after Iraq - TWICE - then you can include them in the countries we defend. OR, you could include a large part of our military as existing BECAUSE of Israel's existence, so they would trump all others in military expenditures by the US on that score. It was the "Israel is my spiritual homeland" Jewish Neo-Cons that helped lead Dubya into the multi-trillion dollar fiasco that has taken place in the middle east. Which raises another thing - Israel and their occupation of the Palestinians was a big reason for 9/11 and other similar acts - more dollars spent defending Israel - that is, their right to exist as a synthetic country of European Jews in an arab land.</comment>

<comment>My definition is much, much better and accurate.We told Israel not to defend itself against Iraq, like we prevent Japan from defending itself. That doesn't count and doesn't apply anymore.No part of our military exists because of Israel. It's merely a very inefficient jobs program.Neo-cons were both Jewish and non-Jewish. The ethnicity wasn't a factor.Israel had nothing to do with 9/11--it was American bases on Saudi soil.More than half the Jews in Israel are descendants of Arab victims of ethnic cleansing. Descendants of Europeans are a minority.</comment>

<comment>Even with your personal definition of foreign aid, we still have "given" much more to Israel. Spent trillions on the second Iraq invasion and will spend trillions on ISIS - all to defend the spiritual homeland of Bush Regime members and one of the biggest employers of the American Congress.</comment>

<comment>No, not at all.  Here, you can see exactly who the largest recipient of foreign aid is, provided you can get your cursor over Israel to see the $3,100,000,000 in promised aid.  Of the places you mentioned, only Saudia Arabia receives foreign aid - a whopping $10,000 worth.</comment>

<comment>Saudi Arabia gets very, very expensive bases and lots of American blood to protect it. Those troops in the Indian Ocean don't defend the US at all.That is foreign aid, whether you call it that or not.</comment>

<comment>This is a one sided relationship with jews mostly having nothing but contempt for GOP voters. I think some of this "support" is media generated astroturf though. I doubt this affects Trump much at all really. It's sickening seeing Mr. Amnesty himself, Marco Rubio, trying to seize on this and score points. </comment>

<comment>Marco Rubio will do anything that the big money wants.  Once  Trump is through the primary it won't matter.  The Evangelical Wackos won't trust Hillary at all</comment>

<comment>In the Cold War Israel was a valuable proxy, and the "plucky little Israel" meme had a great deal more truth in it. But nowadays, with Israel overwhelmingly stronger than its neighbors (and having played the game long enough to commit plenty outrages of its own), unwavering American support makes little-to-no sense. All it does now is appease those evangelical "Christians" who seem to wish Christ never came, and that the Torah was still the only law. And the odd right wing Jewish American. </comment>

<comment>There's no cost to the US for supporting Israel.</comment>

<comment>Tell that to George Marshall. He was right going on 70 years ago.</comment>

<comment>I would. Marshall was dead wrong on Israel and the Arabs; Israel has given the US and the world so much, and the Arabs, only oil. Which is really a curse, if you think about it.</comment>

<comment>No. But there is tremendous cost, mainly to ourselves, in handing out blank checks to Israel. Which we have hitherto done with abandon, and with next to no return on investment.It is easy to wave Arab, Muslim terrorists in our face and go "boo." Naturally Israel is better than Hamas. But as this sh!t storm rolls endlessly on, Americans are beginning to wonder (rightly so) just how much better they really are. And if our time and effort is really worth it.</comment>

<comment>What cost? What can Americans not buy, what can Americans not do because we support Israel. True, lots of ignorant impoverished people who don't produce anything are mad at us, but so what?As far as return on investment, it's been incalculable. Half of the technology you type with spoke Hebrew when it was born. So much medicine, so much water technology, so much given to the world. The "cost" to the US today is mainly at the UN, and really, who cares about that?</comment>

<comment>the Araba oil embargo, the Iraq War, 9/11, Afghanistan, the Libyan War, foreign aid to Israel, foreign aid to Egypt (not to attack Israel)And of course the lives of our brave sailors of the USS Liberty</comment>

<comment>the Araba oil embargo--a failure, won't happen again.the Iraq War--nothing to do with Israel9/11--nothing to do with IsraelAfghanistan--nothing to do with Israelthe Libyan War--nothing to do with Israelforeign aid to Israel--a drop in the bucket, mostly subsidies to US weapons manufacturersforeign aid to Egypt (not to attack Israel)--a drop in the bucket, keeps Egypt from turning into Libya.And of course the lives of our brave sailors of the USS Liberty--friendly fire mess up.</comment>

<comment>The Israelis will find more ways  to spend America's blood and treasure but so far they've cost us trillions of dollars and thousands of dead and tens of thousands of woundedDid I mention the 5 mph speed limit?</comment>

<comment>Wow. That's seriously stupid. Sieg Heil moron!</comment>

<comment>What is seriously stupid is the notion that Israel had nothing to do with the Iraq Wars, the 55 mph speed limit, the destruction of our economy in the 1970s, the prolongation ofthe Soviet Union and a host of other evils</comment>

<comment>55 MPH speed limit was enacted by Carter after the Iranian revolution.But now you're going to blame Khomeini on Israel?</comment>

<comment>Um your totally clueless- Nixon imposed the 55 after the Arab oil embargoe</comment>

<comment>nothing to do with it-Its the rapture- nothing can interfere with the Rapture</comment>

<comment>Here are the three crucial differences between Israel and other recipients of US foreign aid1. most of the money that goes to Israel comes back.2. Israel is the only country that is proud of its relations with America, is loyal, and espouses its values.3. Israel is the only country that makes major returns in terms of military testing, innovation, and intelligence to the UShttp://www.washingtoninstitute...http://www.frontpagemag.com/fp...https://www.foreignaffairs.com...</comment>

<comment>Then explain:- The terrorist assassination of Folke Bernadotte as supervised by a Lehi official and future Israeli PM- The nakbah and its effect on US-Arab relations- II Rabi's betrayal of US nuclear bomb secrets to the Weizmann Institute (where he was a governor) - The Suez crisis and Ike's reaction- Zalman Sapiro and the diversion of naval-grade HEU from NUMEC- The USS Liberty murders- Bibi's theft of krytrons- Jonathan Pollard.Your premises are entirely bogus. And WINEP and Front Page Mag!With friends like these . . . .</comment>

<comment>I don't need to explain any of your points since non of them contradict what I said.It is a well known fact that supporting Israel is not an issue at all for the Gulf States; its the deal with Iran that bothers them.See  Dennis Ross's book and article in Time Maghttp://time.com/4072475/u-s-is...Everyone knows the USS Liberty was a horrible mistake which Israel has profusely apologized for unlike 9/11 done on purpose by the people whom you so cherish and value a relationship with.your points are clearly agenda driven and I am sorry you prioritize your shallow bigotry over our national security and over what is moral and right and that you would side with terrorists for the right price.</comment>

<comment>1. You don't have to explain my points. You should respond to them if you have a shred of honesty in the flabby tissues of your cerebral cortex.I know; they're awfully inconvenient.2. Who do I cherish? The Saudi terrorists?3. The Liberty attack was premeditated and intentional. Ask any survivor (I have)--or the CNO at the time, if he were still alive.4. You in some kind of run-on sentence contest? It mirrors the hyperfine structure of your thought.</comment>

<comment>The only thing that is inconvenient, is that you rather support the Saudis and Qatar and you don't mind their deliberate and ongoing terrorism. You would rather sacrifice the only democracy in the Middle East, and gained imagined favor in the eyes of terrorists. Indeed inconvenient.All investigations conclude that USS Liberty was a tragic mistake.http://www.sixdaywar.org/uss-l...All investigations conclude 9/11 was an act of terror yet you would prefer to side with the Saudis, Qatar and Iran who sponsor terror against Americans to this day.Shame on you.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>I used to know someone--a tech exec--who knows George Gilder. He sez Gilder's a know-nothing crackpot.I have no use for Quatar and the KSA. I have somewhat more for Iran--at least they're fighting Da'esh.I gather you are a firster. Shame on you, traitor, if you're a US citizen.PS. I would direct you to James Bamford's Body of Secrets, but think you'll be unlikely to read it.https://hayaryakanch.files.wor...FWIW, I have no idea if this is an authorized copy.</comment>

<comment>while I am proud of being an America firster, I would much rather be an Israel firster than be a terrorist firster and am saddened that you and your ilk choose to be terrorist firsters.How much did your standing with the Saudis and Islam help us on 9/11?</comment>

<comment>1. I have never stood with the House of Saud. They may be as dangerous to US interests as Pakistan.2. Israel was founded by terrorists, including your namesake.</comment>

<comment>Its very simple, all those who support Israel are pro American and anti terrorists, all those who are pro terror are anti Israel, and you my friend, are a philo terrorist. If you call Menachem Begin a terrorist I assume you think the same of George Washington which is typical among moral relativists like yourself.God bless America.</comment>

<comment>Fred, let me ask you a question in regards to the USS Liberty.What's your take on the US Air Force turning the MSF hospital in Afghanistan into a pile of rubble?Part two of the question, what is your stand on the USS Vincennes affair?</comment>

<comment>I think the first incident is probably a war crime. The second is a case of gross negligence, which can mean the same thing.That said, I'm sick of the reflexive drawing of false equivalences. That's a standard tactic from the hasbara handbook. The USS Liberty mass murder was clearly premeditated.And my other points--Sinai/Suez, NUMEC, Pollard--go on unrefuted.</comment>

<comment>It's interesting to find you so absolute on Israeli premeditation despite the absence of modern technology, while you can only deal with possible flaws in the two American attacks.As for false equivalences, why should questions about friendly fire issues and fog of war errors not be analyzed against each other?</comment>

<comment>Fog of war, my ass! It was clear as a bell, broad daylight in the eastern Med. The Liberty was flying a large American flag and had its name, in Roman letters, prominently displayed. With all the antennas, the silhouette of Liberty was among the most distinctive in the world. It was making at most 5 kts (not the 20-plus claimed by the Israelis).The Mirages and Mysteres attacked for over twenty minutes, then the PT boats follows up. The intention was clearly to kill the entire ship's complement, including crewmen in lifeboats.The lame IDF excuse was that the ship was misidentified as an Egyptian horse transport. The ship had about one half the length of the Liberty, and one quarter the displacement. Israeli intelligence must also have known the vessel was in port in Egypt.Have you even read Bamford's chapter on this massacre? Or are you just another hasbara sockpuppet, a Sgt Schultz at that? Heavens I hope you're not getting paid for this, because your response is lame beyond measure.</comment>

<comment>Roman letters?  Kind of like when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor?  And seriously, the size of the lettering at the stern is small.And the flag, was flapping in the strong breeze, old Glory taut in the wind, the Stars and Stripes waving for all to see?Or, has been seen, draped straight down, with the most of the flag wrapped in on itself.But its amazing, how you can sit there and defend Americans blowing up civilian targets - let's forget the idea of friendly fire, something that has occurred in every war up through the present day.  But ONLY Israel of all states was out to do some inane double-cross.Spare me the hyperbole.  There were not one, but 10 separate investigations into the attack, which Israel both apologized and paid reparations for.  It's been 50 years, you might as well jump down the throats of the Japanese today for Pearl Harbor or the British for the sacking of the White House during the war of 1812.</comment>

<comment>Where have I defended America bombing civilian targets? I called both MSF and Vincennes likely war crimes. I want this nation the hell out of the region.We dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese. We kicked British ass as New Orleans. Does that imply something> I don't know.Have you read Bamford's chapter or not? I can give you a link. But you're far too intellectually dishonest to pursue it.</comment>

<comment>I read Bamford's chapter when it originally came out and didn't think much of it then.  I also read a number of rebuttals to his claims and find that his arguments don't hold water.That you claim any disagreement is premeditated dishonesty shows that re-reading his claims won't be meaningful in any way and not worth my time.You've gone down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole.  Enjoy.Just don't be surprised when you're called a conspiracy theorist, at least have the honesty to own up to it.</comment>

<comment>You and honesty are completely orthogonal.Are you, after all, paid hasbara?</comment>

<comment>Sorry that you're unable to deal with people who differ in their beliefs than you.And for the record, no, I'm not on the Israeli payroll.  Never have been.But thanks for trying to push that accusation, it shows more of your desperate need to believe in conspiracy theories.</comment>

<comment>I have recited the evidence on the USS Liberty murders. I could do the same for the NUMEC thefts of HEU, and Bibi's theft of krytrons (you do know what those are, don;t you?). Jonathan Pollard's depredations are matters of public record. Yet--no real refutation from you.One need not be supporting conspiracy theories to cite and adduce evidence. Do you think pointing out the existence of a Greater Israel Lobby with influence in Washington on a par with the NRA or AARP is conspiracy theorizing? Are Mearsheimer and Walt conspiracy theorists?</comment>

<comment>Then explain Bibi going behind Obama's back with his March address to Congress re: the Iranian nuclear deal. For a country that shows such respect to us, they sure don't give a crap about diplomatic protocols and the constitution itself (i.e. it's the executive branch that crafts foreign policy).</comment>

<comment>So now you've decided to eliminate the first amendment?</comment>

<comment>That's a hell lot different when it comes to foreign affairs:a) When foreign leaders visit the US, especially to give speeches to Congress, they're SUPPOSED to give the President a heads up, at mimimum. Bibi ignoring that just showed massive disrespect on his part.b) The executive branch is responsible for foreign affairs. c) How did you even bring up the first amendment in the first place?</comment>

<comment>a:  Obama received a heads up and the fact is, Netanyahu was invited by the Speaker of the House, hardly a minor official.b: The executive branch is not in charge of the Congress.c:  Complaining about Israel voicing its concern over the Iran nuclear deal is trying to stifle free speech.  Especially when whining about Israel going behind Obama's back.This is the same Obama who shut Israel out of the negotiations with Iran despite the significant and direct impact it has on Israel's security and well being.Oh, and the March speech comes six months after the anonymous 'chickenshit' comments.  So much for Obama and respect.</comment>

<comment>a) Ok, I should've amended that slightly: http://blogs.reuters.com/great...b) See part ac) Israel's free to do so...the problem is that right doesn't extend to undermining a sitting President like thatWe don't if it was an Obama official who made those comments. The state department's huge and everything. Could've been a republican official for all we know.Besides, there's a good reason for obama shutting Israel out of negotiations: Israel spied on the US talks before hand in 2012 when we were just getting started and threatened an attack on Iran to scuttle any talks. How's that for being a good ally?</comment>

<comment>No one was undermining Obama.  Netanyahu is rightly concerned that the Iran deal was a bad one and one that seriously threatens Israel.Iran is not a passive actor in pushing for Israel's destruction and post deal, its actions seem to have borne out its PM's concerns.Obama has done everything including call the opponents of the deal warmongers.  As an American who opposes the deal I find his stand offensive and with family living in Israel, I am more than a little concerned for their lives given Iran's rhetoric and deeds.As for the slur, we know this.  Jeff Goldberg has had a tight enough relationship with Obama to gain access to do not one, but multiple interviews with the President, including a visit to Jeff's own synagogue for a Presidential speech.Do you really think that he would risk that access by not checking with the POTUS before publishing such a slur?If Obama didn't say it himself, he surely approved it.  2012 was when Obama blocked Israel from any information about the negotiations.  Given Iran's repeated threats to destroy Israel would you sit on your hands if you were Israel's leaders?</comment>

<comment>Not at all.Beyond the enormous amounts of aid Israel receives from the U.S. government, Israel is heavily dependent upon capital inflows from U.S. citizens and U.S. businesses.  Capital most definitely is not flowing back to the U.S., at all.Israel is the only ally of the U.S. that had one of its citizens sentenced to life imprisonment for espionage in the U.S.  If that's loyalty, it's certainly a strange way of showing it.  When has Israel ever made a sacrifice for the benefit of the U.S.?Israel is indeed quite capable of developing outstanding military technology, intelligence, and innovations.  Those things beg the question as to why Israel needs such significant aid from the U.S. when the country seems perfectly capable of providing for itself.</comment>

<comment>get your facts right, Pollard was not an Israeli citizen.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Looks like you can join the ranks of James Baker, Colin Powell, and R. Nicholas Burns:http://www.politico.com/story/...http://www.jpost.com/Middle-Ea...https://www.bostonglobe.com/op...</comment>

<comment>A loss of 5% of the vote in key states is not insignificant. So the 70-30 number leads to the wrong conclusion. He can afford to do without the donations, not the votes.Trump doesn't want to touch the ant-Semitism nerve in his nativist base because it will be just as ugly as his previous appeals to racist sentiment. That would be where Trump would have to go to make up for lost jewish votes.</comment>

<comment>The Saudis do not pay the soldiers' salaries. They do not treat the soldiers' wounds. No, the US troops bleed for the House of Saud, not for Israel, not for the US.</comment>

<comment>Wow, Jews being huge crybabies, making a political issue out of nothing, and then demanding everyone beg at their feet.  What a huge surprise, this has never happened before in American politics.</comment>

<comment>Dude, what?</comment>

<comment>You should learn the difference between Jews and Zionists, though I admit that shlock like that penned by Chandler above will not help you in that endeavour.</comment>

<comment>I wonder how Spudwhisperer will take this? Lol.</comment>
