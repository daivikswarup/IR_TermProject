<comment>It's difficult not to lose respect for Cruz after listening to him speak numerous times.</comment>

<comment>Who can listen to that voice for more than a few minutes?Fingernails on a chalkboard.</comment>

<comment>Thank you I thought I was alone on that point, the guy is a creep and his voice makes you want to puke.</comment>

<comment>Great people often do that to small, petty people.  Guess which one you are?</comment>

<comment>GREAT PEOPLE yes! but we are talking about Ted cruz here.</comment>

<comment>Plus he lies constantly. Cruz defines "Smarmy Texas Politician"</comment>

<comment>Dimwitted leftwits that voted for 0bama twice all agree, Cruz looks like something.  Anyone with a brain is voting for the only man that can save this once great country form Libidiots like you and his name is Cruz..  Of course hyper-emotional dimwitted indoctrinated Democrats despise Cruz.  He is Americas only hope as Democrats actively destroy America..</comment>

<comment>@Dusty Thompson -- I hate to break it to you, but most Republicans despise Cruz as well. He is thoroughly unlikable, and he has ZERO crossover appeal. Not only will he NEVER get the nomination, he wouldn't have an ice cube's chance in HELL of winning a general election. Yes, Mr. Cruz has his fans among the far religious-right evangelicals, but that is where his support ends.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think I'm buying your complete fabrications?  A statement does not an argument make.  Watching CNN has stunted your ability to think.Cruz has been in second place and rising.  Trump is an 0bama wannabe and rational people are figuring this out for themselves in larger and larger numbers.Religion has nothing to do with it.  Morality still does...Democrats are intentionally throwing this election because they know 0bamas bill comes due Jan 20th 2017 and Democrats want to blame the GOP for it just as they did 2007..SHrillay and Bernie?  Really???</comment>

<comment>"Things I disagree with" ≠ "Complete fabrications." Calm the hell down.</comment>

<comment>Religion has nothing to do with it, you fool did you here Cruz say that every President should begin the day on his knees. If that was NOT a religious statement then  the men in Cruz's staff should be very careful.Ted would not be president his raving fire and brimstone father would be in charge.</comment>

<comment>I am not religious at all and the ONLY person I am voting for is Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Unlike Trump.  Hopefully, Cruz will get at least a VP or Supreme Court Justice position.  If not the presidency.I'm glad to break it to YOU, though, Jackson F.  NEITHER Hillary nor Bernie have any crossover appeal, either.  BOTH are way too far left.  Plus, Hillary's scandal is even bigger than Nixon's, and may well be indicted yet.  And, both the stock market and the economy are in the process of tanking.Both should bottom out about the time of November 8th, the second Tuesday in November, this year.And that's not right about about Cruz's support, either.  I'm a Roman Catholic who hasn't been to church in 2 years or so, and he is MY first choice (though Trump runs a close second).The reason Democrats don't like Cruz is just because they are racist.  The only reason they will vote against Cruz is just because Ted Cruz is Hispanic.  There aren't any Hispanic candidates running for the Democratic nomination.Add to all that, the fact that once the 3rd tier of candidates bow out of the race, they well may go to Cruz, and not Trump.  One prominent political scientist that I follow closely is seeing that possibility.  We'll know, after March 15.</comment>

<comment>Wow, you lost any shred of credibility you might have had when you suggested that Dem voters are racist against Hispanics.  That must be quite the bubble you live in!  I suppose you're probably just a troll working for the campaign.I guess you'll be completely shocked once again when Dems win the Presidency against all your party's published polling.  Enjoy!</comment>

<comment>Wow, you lost any shred of credibility you might have had when you suggested that Dem voters are racist against Hispanics.So why aren't Dems going to vote for Cruz, for president?  That IS the only reason that Obama could have possibly lost either of his elections for president, correct?  At least, that's what I read in the Leftstream media.So, by simply abiding by liberal logic, the only possible reason that Democrats, Black and White, are not, to a man, supporting either Cruz or Rubio.  There are no Democrat candidates, other than White.</comment>

<comment>Just because some people make a claim of racism, doesn't mean the majority of a group (in this case Dems, believe it).  I do believe that maybe 10% or more of US voters were racist enough to vote AGAINST Obama mostly because of his skin color.  Maybe another 5% because of his name.I lived in Cincinnati, which is a mix of Ohio, Kentucky and Indiana-types, and it was FULL of vocal racists.  History tells us that much of the South was even worse, and so could be expected to be comparatively so still today.That leaves at least 80% of Republican voters who are NOT racist, if you grant that 1/3 of those folks might have been potential Dems to start with.Regardless, you're making a straw man argument by deflecting criticism of Cruz via Dem statements from 2008 and '12.Even further, your radically "conservative" views are thankfully in such a minority that folks like you will only help elect the Democratic nominee by selecting the Republican primary candidate least palatable to the vast majority of swing voters.  Mark my words and check back in after November :P</comment>

<comment>I have news for you Cruz has no crossover appeal he is far to far to the right. So far that even Republicans hate him.</comment>

<comment>So I guess that, with neither Hillary, Bernie nor Cruz having any crossover appeal, Trump will be our next president, for sure!And then, he can either select Cruz for VP or nominate him for Justice!  Sounds great to me!</comment>

<comment>Trump is actually the ONLY candidate on either side with crossover appeal</comment>

<comment>Trump has the MOST crossover appeal.  But Cruz will still get a good portion of the swing vote.Particularly after both the markets and the economy bottom out, as is already well in progress.</comment>

<comment>Wow! You're truly delusional</comment>

<comment>You haven't been following the stock market?  It has come off its highs some time ago, and has been continuing to correct for the loss of Helicopter Ben(Bernanke)'s Quantitative Easing (read: printing money/expanding the money supply).The economy has been going south as well, as the Leftstream CNN is reporting in this column: Cracks in America's economy are growing,  by Patrick Gillespie January 29, 2016: 5:12 AM ET.I'm not seeing just what's so delusional about that.</comment>

<comment>Of course I've been watching the stock market. I've lost a fortune already the 1st 6 weeks of 2016. I said you were "delusional" regarding Ted Cruz -- he is NOT going to get the nomination.</comment>

<comment>I never actually said that Cruz will get the nomination.  I said he will get a good portion of the swing vote (meaning in the general election, should he make it that far).  It's certainly looking like Trump will get it, at this point.As far as the primaries are concerned, DickMorris, whom I follow closely,  has been saying that despite that, there are some signs that those who are supporting the "lesser" candidates may well prefer Cruz, to Trump.  And if that's the case, if you take all the support that Cruz now has, with the support from the "lesser" candidates after their first choice falls out may well total more than Trump's support, alone.He's been saying that there is no way to know for sure until after the March 15 primaries.  (I have sensed a new hesitation by him, though, as these "lesser" candidates have proven more resilient than he had anticipated, meaning that Trump will indeed keep his lead throughout.)While Cruz is certainly my first choice - Rush has recently endorsed him -  I'd most certainly be quite happy with a President Trump.   Either one.</comment>

<comment>Cruz will be done after South Carolina...bet he drops out after the SEC</comment>

<comment>He has a great ground game, and good funding.  But I still won't bet against you.  People rightfully love what Trump is offering.Cruz would make a great VP choice, ensuring a strong conservative turnout on November 8th.  And a strong Justice nominee.  It's looking like whichever Republican wins the nomination, will win in a landslide (January 10, 2016, 06:00 am "Economist: GOP may win 47 states in general election"), so if we can keep Obama's choice from being confirmed, Cruz won't need to win any popularity contests.  Unlike Obama, Cruz is an actual Constitutional Scholar.</comment>

<comment>Cruz would hurt more than help Trump if he was his VP choice because he's simply TOO far religious right for mainstream voters, and they won't want Cruz a heartbeat away from the Presidency. Personally, I don't think Cruz will ever be POTUS. Not in 2016...not in 2020...not in 2024....not EVER! That being said, I do think that Cruz has his plusses in terms of what he could contribute -- perhaps Attorney General -- Perhaps even on The Supreme Court (though he'd have a tough time getting confirmed since he has few, if any, friends in congress.</comment>

<comment>If and when Cruz gets selected VP, non-conservatives will forget that he's there, but will still drive the base, who's motivated by such things.But, who know?  Maybe you're right.</comment>

<comment>Cruz won't be POTUS or VP. He's just not likable</comment>

<comment>Wait, you're basing your opinion that the Republican nominee will win in a landslide on that article you noted?  Here's the beginning of that article:"Supply-side economist Arthur Laffer is predicting Republicans will win the White House in a landslide this year, regardless of the nominee.“I would be surprised if the Republicans don’t take 45, 46, 47 states out of the 50,” Laffer told host John Catsimatidis on “The Cats Roundtable” on New York’s AM-970 on Sunday."So, a clearly partisan Republican hack says so on AM radio and it becomes gospel?  Wow, just wow.  This is how you brainiacs were so confident then blindsided when Romney got shellacked in 2012.  You guys live in an echo-chamber of misinformation so vast it boggles the mind.Come find me after the election to let me know how it goes ;)</comment>

<comment>This is how you brainiacs were so confident then blindsided when Romney got shellacked in 2012.I couldn't help but notice that you failed to provide the link/reference to the polling firm that told only Democrats, and not Republicans, the foretold the actual outcome of election 2012.  Now why would that be?And of course, the answer is that there was no such firm.  And you still can't provide the name even now, after I've challenged you on this.  So all that you are really doing is, with benefit of hindsight, is simply SAYING that you Democrats correctly predicted the election outcome, again, after the results were all in.  Boy, you Democrats really are so brilliant to have to rely on history to "prove" that you were right all along!So now, let me tell you what actually happened.  The polling firm Gallup, which had always been the gold standard for horse-race presidential politics, was calling the race wrong (Gallup gives up the horse raceAs pollsters confront unprecedented obstacles, the biggest name in the business backs away. By Steven Shepard 10/07/15 05:09 AM EDT).  Their polls had shown that Romney would win.  (What - you thought that Republicans were saying that just be reading tea leaves, or some such BS?)  Then Hurricane Sandy struck, and knocked out power to a pretty good sized area of NY/NJ.  Obama was excitedly greeted by NJ Governor Chris Christie.  (Ever notice that Christie has never again been embraced by Republicans, since then?)  One of America's most densely populated areas of the country fell in love with Obama, all over again, and there was no way for Gallup to see it, with all of the telephone lines down.  And all of this was right before the election.  And Gallup has quit doing horse race polling as a result.So you obviously expect me to be humbled by Democrat's hind-sight, think again.   Your 20-20 hind sight ranks right up there with your straw-man arguments and your ad hominem attacks.If you really want to impress Republicans, finally make wealth-redistribution economics work.  The reason none of the variations never have worked, to date, is because they all carry with them an intrinsic flaw: All people under such a system lose any incentive to be productive.  You simply can't have wealth without production.  The only person to ever come close, at all, was Josef Stalin.  He provided negative motivation.  That is, closely monitoring the production of everything, himself, and ruling through a reign of terror, he would identify people, or groups of people who, in his view, were not productive, then have them arrested and either executed or sent off to the gulag.  Is that how Hillary and Bernie plan to make their economics work, should they win?Bernie can't attract enough swing voters, Hillary is alienating just about everybody, even if she never gets indicted before the election, and BOTH have a collapsing stock market and economy to contend with.  And Trump has had substantial crossover appeal.Come find me after the election to let me know how it goes ;)Sure!  Be glad to do that.  Glad we have Disqus to help us!</comment>

<comment>I don't have much time to address each point in detail right now, but here are a couple good links:http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.n...Oct 24 - "Mr. Obama’s chances of winning the Electoral College were up in the FiveThirtyEight forecast to 71 percent on Wednesday from 68.1 percent on Tuesday."And then up to 92% by Nov 5th -http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.n...compared to:http://www.breitbart.com/big-g...  ...which was a more nuanced analysis than I believe most die-hard Repubs were reading.You suggest it had much to do with Sandy and Christie, whereas I recall it had much to do with Obama recovering from a very poor first debate, plus Romney's fatal 47% line and overall weakness as a candidate (as opposed to leader).  Perhaps we're both right (or wrong), but regardless, my favored prediction source (Nate Silver's comprehensive meta-analysis in "fivethirtyeight") in 2012 turned out to be far more accurate than your party's.You could do well to learn your lessons from this and give his analyses more credence, lest you be surprised yet again.  His primaries analysis is less impressive, so I wouldn't pay too much attention to his stuff until later.Btw, you do realize that the US tax system was HIGHLY redistributive in the roaring 50's, right?</comment>

<comment>Republicans should accept Obamas nominee ASAP because Hillary will nominate a true left winger. Not some sap who moans about the 2nd amendment and the erosion of religious rights.Religious rights my foot.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.  Hillary would nominate Obama as a Justice.  Heaven Forbid.And, aren't "religious rights" also civil rights?  Do atheists have their beliefs protected?  Are their religious beliefs more protected than the rights of theists?</comment>

<comment>Alright you can have your religious rights, yu have the right to praay to Mickey Mouse or Pluto the dog  or the friendly GHOST whatever his name is. You have the right to crawl on your belly before graven images and ask them to tell you the winning lottery numbers. I prefer the company of human beings especially my grandchildren, we just fall  all over the floor when we hear the bleating sheep surrender any vestige of self respect with ludicrous remarks like "it is gods will"".You can have your religious right but keep the hell out of my way.</comment>

<comment>Are you really sure about that?  It's uncommon for typically intolerant atheist to allow anyone else to have religious beliefs.  I feel that I'm getting off light with you just settling for engaging in (what you Democrats would typically define as) hate speech.  That wouldn't be enough for most atheists.Today must be my lucky day!</comment>

<comment>The reason Republicans do not like hm is because he goes after them too. That is another one of the good things about Cruz. You really are lost.</comment>

<comment>We'll actually know after Saturday when Trump trounces Cruz. Also, you don't think Hillary has crossover appeal? Just wait and see if Cruz, by some freak of nature, gets the nomination. You'll see Repubs crossing over to vote Democrat --- me included</comment>

<comment>We'll actually know what, after Saturday?Absolutely.  Her scandals total MUCH greater than Nixon's.  Nixon didn't endanger national security.  Or result in needless loss of life.Hillary is way more progressive than Bill.  People won't buy it.</comment>

<comment>You are just a sucker for punishment aren't you. Just read about the criminal incompetence of Ron Reagan when he sent the marines to Lebanon. He and the marine CO, I think his name was Kelly, where warned on several occasions that the marines were housed in very dangerous quarters, but the warnings were IGNORED. The Marine commander was a jerk who wouldn't listen to anyone, after all he was a US MARINE and The result was that 241 marines died in a suicide bombing, YES 241 MARINES DIED. Their deaths could easily have been avoided if the many warnings had been acted uponTheir deaths can be laid directly at the door of Ron Reagan and you complain about Hillary.You people are SOOOOOOOO BLIND.Once again 241 marines DIED and Reagan was the supreme commander.Where were the congressional hearings? were was the outcry, if anything screamed impeachment the deaths of 241 Marines did. No one was even reprimanded.</comment>

<comment>Brit1066?  1066 was the year when you Brits were defeated by the Duke William II of Normandy, correct?  Talk of incompetence!And only a Leftie would see a national defeat as something that you would want to associate yourself with!So if that "scandal" was bigger than Watergate, why hasn't the Leftstream media proclaimed it as such?Pollster Pat Caddell: Hillary Clinton Email Scandal ‘Worse Than Watergate’ by CHARLIE SPIERING 13 Feb 2016And this guy supports Jimmy Carter!</comment>

<comment>No.  I could never do that.</comment>

<comment>You seem to totally miss it. 1) It is because he has gone against the Republican Establishment that he is such an attractive candidate and 2) You do not have to be religious to like Cruz. I am not religious at all -- but Cruz represents my other values perfectly.</comment>

<comment>VALUES what VALUES? Republicans cannot even spell the word. Teds dad is a raving drooling preacher, those of us who want NOTHING to do with religion will have OUR RIGHTS taken away by the Cruz clan</comment>

<comment>Not to worry, Brit. The Cruz Clan will be going down in flames sooner rather than later. He has no appeal outside of The Bible Belt</comment>

<comment>And Hillary oozes in values, I suppose.</comment>

<comment>Values, the people of SC re-elected a governor who stole State funds to skip the country to screw his Argentinian GF, while telling his family he was hiking on the Appalachian trail. He was hiking alright but not on that trail. Then there is senator Vitter from LA who hooked up with HOOKERS then dragged his poor wife to a news conference to humiliate her.Values! what a joke.There are hundreds more.Both sides have problems but Hillary has far less then most</comment>

<comment>You have GOT to be kidding me.  You obviously stick to Leftstream Media,</comment>

<comment>Cruz would get me to vote for Hillary. He is a smarmy Texas politician --- NO THANK YOU!</comment>

<comment>I know ZERO non-religious people who can't stand Cruz. He's got ZERO crossover appeal.</comment>
