<comment>Gary Johnson</comment>

<comment>On Twitter a few years ago, I sent a series of questions to Johnson during an online event he held. He answered one or two with weak canned responses, but couldn't answer followups (the 4/25 post):24ahead.com/s/gary-johnsonThe only thing Johnson is qualified for is endurance sports, and to that I tip my hat to him. His policy ideas are in left field.</comment>

<comment>All Trump does is read the news, then shout out the news he read during the debate and his uneducated voters thinks he is making a point.Trump's debate material is all the news that I read.The other candidates debate like scholars and with new material that I am learning.</comment>

<comment>all Hillapottamus and Mr. Socialist do is talk about free stuff, raising taxes, economic plans which would destroy the economy, and other fantasy land things.  Hillary even laughed off how others are in federal prison for lesser offenses than what she has done with sending state secrets over insecure networks.</comment>

<comment>All Jim Smith does is give spoon-fed strawman arguments.</comment>

<comment>They don't let him use the forks.</comment>

<comment>Rubio should have to graduate from junior high before he can be president.</comment>

<comment>And lose the high heels!</comment>

<comment>#LITTLEBOYRUBIO!That's what Trump should call him.ALWAYS.</comment>

<comment>because height...that's what makes a president successful. I guess you must like Obama and Bill Clinton then.</comment>

<comment>Rubio proved he is a disrespectful smart mouth Cuban wet back period</comment>

<comment>From the racist crap spewing out of your whatever, I assume you are a Trumpkin.</comment>

<comment>He look like monkey.</comment>

<comment>Carson and Kasich should not be in debate.  Good on CNN to cut them out of the frame!</comment>

<comment>Rubio says his mom was "made at a hotel".</comment>

<comment>What? omg</comment>

<comment>He might have said, "a maid at a hotel" who knows. Haha.</comment>

<comment>he did say maid. he also proved he is a disrespectful smart mouth Cuban wet back punk</comment>

<comment>You must be Trump's key man in "Get out the vote for Trump".</comment>

<comment>Wolf Blitzer is great.  This is how you do it.  Last real journalist on TV.   Maybe anywhere.</comment>

<comment>He's not bad for a canine.</comment>

<comment>Haha!</comment>

<comment>Blitzer scored $-5000 or so on Jeopardy (that's negative $5000).In any sort of business not involving nepotism, you can't just propose wild ideas and say things are going to be great. You have to answer question after question and defend them. Yet, all Wolf did was ask Trump a couple of weak questions about how he'd cut spending, and then dropped it.Trump wants to radically change the govt structure, and hacks like Wolf treat it like they were just discussing the plans for a Sunday picnic.</comment>

<comment>Wharton  unfortunately I did not realize people like trump also attended </comment>

<comment>??? Wolf got steamrolled by everyone... even Kasich!OOF!So far, I think Dickerson was the best moderator.He STOOD up to them all like a man.</comment>

<comment>Romney WAS terrible!!</comment>

<comment>I'm a DEM... and I watched Romney CRUSH Obama in all categories in ALL 3 debates.(Both are liars, but Romney was SKILLED at it!)(by contrast, Biden obliterated Ryan in one of the worst beatdowns ever.)Obama is a moron... the BLACK Bush... so Romney REALLY had to suck to lose to him by ten MILLION votes! OUCH!Shillary is also a worthless debater. She's not even a legit candidate! (She's a FAMOUS WIFE. Let's stop pretending anything more.)(I'm voting BERNIE!)</comment>

<comment>Boy, you must be smoking something.</comment>

<comment>Your entire comment pretty much sums up why people have such dislike for some Bernie supporters.  Too much like Trump supporters in the disdain you have for anyone who might think differently than you do. We're electing a president not a messiah.  Bernie has some good ideas that I hope will be incorporated in the platform but Hillary has the history and the knowledge to have earned a chance at the job in my opinion.  A "worthless debater"?  If you call a command of facts and practical ideas worthless I guess....</comment>

<comment>...on the COUCH, cuz even his wife is ashamed of him.</comment>

<comment>Every time the plants in the crowd cheered Rubio's rehearsed "zingers", Trump SHOULD'VE pointed it out by saying "please clap!" (Ha!)</comment>

<comment>We don't pick winners and losers.... except for a tax plans.</comment>

<comment>Works every time.</comment>

<comment>I'm beating you in the polls! It's fantastic, wonderful, beautiful!</comment>

<comment>... and that's what's ASTONISHING about his aplomb.That he's killing it, even phoning it in like he does is WHAT makes his candidacy so impressive to many of us. BRAVO!!!!They're ALL full of shit (especially Shillary)... but somehow TRUMP pulls it off with pure chutzpah!</comment>

<comment>CARSON IS A BRAIN SURGEON LIKE TRUMP IS A BILLIONAIRE (nope; he's only worth many hundreds of millions, but that doesn't roll off the tongue nor sound as impressive).... LIKE SHILLARY IS A LEGIT CANDIDATE (and not just a Famous Wife)!</comment>

<comment>He's ruined his reputation for life. You've got to feel bad for the guy.</comment>

<comment>Just fail to understand why these guys are refusing to take Trump to the mat. Same stump bullcrap, but they should be attacking relentlessly, mercilessly, and non-stop.</comment>

<comment>They're WEAK!</comment>

<comment>That's actually issue -- they come across as fearful, and it reinforces Trump's position.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, one of these clowns is going to be the party's nominee. Equally sadly, none of them deserve it. And neither do we Americans.</comment>

Not even subtle how weak they were.(which is why the press is hammering their script about how take-no-prisoners both were!)</comment>

<comment>I think it's because they don't know how.  Rubio just looks silly with what he did.  Honestly I can't think of anything positive about any of the top three contenders on the Republican side.  They're all scary.</comment>

<comment>The rich and elite can't hear words let alone actions.</comment>

<comment>The basic trick the GOP has long been pulling is exploiting the fact that the base only pays attention to the words the candidates say while the rich elites only care about the actions the politician takes.  So, if they say what the base wants to hear and do what the rich want done, then they get both the donations they need from the rich and the votes they need from the base.</comment>

<comment>I pay $1700 for ER visit under Obamacare while uninsured pay $0.</comment>

<comment>It was like that before Obamacare. I'm not a fan of the ACA but I've also been paying for insurance for a long, long time and do not see how the prior system was better.</comment>

<comment>My insurance changed a lot.</comment>

<comment>I'm paying a bit more, but much more important to me is that the ACA essentially got rid of the exclusion clause that let insurers discriminate against people who have a disease. Excluding people from healthcare because they have a pre-existing condition (which, btw, includes many millions of hard-working Americans) is pretty lousy if not immoral.</comment>

<comment>It's coming down to pro-sidewalk death and anti-sidewalkers.</comment>

<comment>There are Republican primary voters who would buy tickets to watch people die on the streets.</comment>

<comment>Authoritarians.</comment>

<comment>So long as those tickets are not too pricey. Those people are not worth expensive tickets...</comment>

<comment>Remember Wolf Blitzer's 'gotcha' question?"Should we just let them die?"</comment>

<comment>This exchange shows how far out of the republican mainstream Trump is, because most republicans are actually in favor of people dying in the street.</comment>

<comment>And then eating them</comment>

<comment>No. Only feeding them to Zoo carnivores to save on their budget. Some of those people dying on the sidewalk are not USDA approved, you know...</comment>

<comment>You don't have to leave so many comments, especially since they have no content.</comment>

<comment>Hey Bubba – it's sad that you are so lonely but how about keeping to yourself.</comment>

<comment>That was mean to a mean girl.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that's one of the ten commandments.</comment>

<comment>They're not in favor of saying so publicly.</comment>

<comment>See not wanting people to die on this street is obviously socialism.  A capitalist country usually encourages people to step over the dying carefully.</comment>

<comment>"Step[ping] over the dying carefully" is the mark of a "compassionate conservative."</comment>

<comment>exactly.</comment>

<comment>Ah, Lincoln destroyed the country? Poe's Law?</comment>

<comment>Clearly he did</comment>

<comment>The only country he destroyed was the CSA - and bully for him.</comment>

<comment>The entire United States </comment>

<comment>But, you, Donald, will make America great again, right?...</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>Whine more.</comment>

<comment>I just thought it was funny.</comment>

<comment>So this is the pander-to-Israel section?</comment>

<comment>Equal parts somber and gratified.</comment>

<comment>"I was the Grand Marshall...."   every Trump supporter in the country was worried about how that sentence ended.</comment>

<comment>I love Trump on Israel.  This is substance.  No other candidate says this.</comment>

<comment>ha ha. Yes, of course you do.</comment>

<comment>My cable is out. What happened?</comment>

<comment>Not much really.  </comment>

<comment>No I mean, Trump on Israel what did he say?</comment>

<comment>Bring peace by being neutral</comment>

<comment>Ugh... I agree with you and Donald Trump. I'm upvoting, but then I'm taking a shower.</comment>

<comment>He said he supports genital mutilators.</comment>

<comment>they ALL said that! (EX: Christian church!) (ex: Judaism)!</comment>

<comment>BERNIE ALSO wants to scream "ISRAEL IS A TERRORIST NATION!" but can you blame him for playing it extra safe?(They'd strap a bomb to his bus in 30 minutes!)HUGE props to Trump for saying what no one else will.</comment>

<comment>"Moral relativism." Everyone drinks.</comment>

<comment>Why does Trump even bother to respond to Cruz?  He should just ignore Cruz.</comment>

<comment>not a bad idea:just PUT HIS HAND UP and that's it!</comment>

<comment>WE ALL <3 Israel....because of the endtimes.....We support ALL the genital mutilators.</comment>

<comment>It is.  Donald Trump's dominating  the Republican debate ( at least as of 10:15 P.M. ET )</comment>

<comment>The "we" Kasich is talking about, that's the Obama administration right?  Did a Republican president just accidentally compliment Obama.</comment>

<comment>Kasich is a centrist. He'll compliment anyone</comment>

<comment>Did you ever wonder why he's losing?</comment>

<comment>Actually, Marco, the Palestinians are a real estate deal.</comment>

<comment>I know right?</comment>

<comment>MAYBE the dumbest line of the nite... AND he said it twice!</comment>

<comment>Shrill Rubio... it is unpleasant just how high his voice rises when he is under attack.</comment>

<comment>Teacher!  Teacher! Teacher!</comment>

<comment>All we are say-ing....Is give Trump a chance....</comment>

<comment>...and Ben Carson says... "... huh?"</comment>

<comment>Why does "Wolf" Blitzer even have a job?</comment>

<comment>true.really drowned tonite.</comment>

<comment>Carson's complaining about time, I'm waiting for a moderator to say "with all due respect, we're not sure why you're still on the stage."</comment>

<comment>Possibly too late.</comment>

<comment>Is Carson reading from a script? He keeps glancing down at the podium every time he launches into a speech.</comment>

<comment>It's the notes written on his hand.</comment>

<comment>Ben Carson says that Israel is our child.</comment>

<comment>Never understood their Israel fetish.</comment>

<comment>It's the evangelical thing with their "end Times"</comment>

<comment>Oh. This would be a good night for the end times.</comment>

<comment>HINT:$$$$$$$$$$</comment>

<comment>Trump...about ...to blame....Bush</comment>

<comment>Israel's Shaked love tryst with Cruz AND Rubio 3-Way !  Trump calls Robio joke artist, Cruz a liar.  LOL</comment>

<comment>So....Israel....Republicans and genital mutilation.</comment>

<comment>Trump calls Cruz a "basket case"</comment>

<comment>yeah, but THAT is a weak insult.Trump can and should do better.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is a basket case!</comment>

<comment>Reince needs to cut the power.  This is beyond parody.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is now certified tragedy.</comment>

<comment>ha ha haWatching this clown crash is amazing. AMAZING.This is the Republican party???What a bunch of losers.</comment>

<comment>at least they're INTERESTING!TRY watching Shillary speak. She's unlistenable and unwatchable.Like an early version of animatronics.Yikes!Bernie is surprisingly agile and witty.</comment>

<comment>Interesting to watch the debate and several websites.Watching the drivel roll in at Breitbart, I'm not sure I registered that the only viable GOP alternatives to Trump are both Cuban. Let's just say lots of these folks took "Red Dawn" a little personally. They dislikes them some Cubans.</comment>

<comment>" Let's just say lots of these folks took "Red Dawn" a little personally."Yeah, but version 1 or version 2?</comment>

<comment>Which one involved "letting the Cubans fight it out"?</comment>

<comment>Dunno... I prefer version 1 since it was so much more baldly a paranoid right wing fantasy.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely, you can't just fake or reinvent 80s hokey.I probably shouldn't be surprised at the Breitbart trolls and must have registered that some certain righties wouldn't vote for a Cuban as dogcatcher. I just didn't think there would be so many of them...</comment>

<comment>No one has mentioned EMPs yet.Cue Ben Carson.....</comment>

<comment>Trump/Carson (???)</comment>

<comment>Carson is not....</comment>

<comment>Kasich wants Carson to anesthetize Apple and "the security people" .</comment>

<comment>And tonight is the night this life-long Republican decided to vote for Hillary.</comment>

<comment>It's the right choice. The people on that stage are fcuking insane.</comment>

<comment>HURRAH.  You won't be sorry.  She'll be a great president.</comment>

<comment>ARE YOU KIDDING?Have you been living in a cave for 30 years?ex: Billary Clinton ran the most RIGHT WING WH in history, from Glass Steagall to welfare reform and on and on.ex: "I WILL TELL WALL ST TO CUT IT OUT" was THE most childish and inept sentence EVER uttered during a debate!I can list 20,000 more concrete examples like these.She's not even a legit candidate!</comment>

<comment>Pretty much. You can excuse a lot, but that was a balls-out clown show.</comment>

<comment>LOL! If you do, you might as well surrender to the bad guys now. You won't have a gun much longer!</comment>

<comment>I hear you. I'm just so, so embarrassed that my party has allowed Trump to happen. I've given a lot to that party, and maybe turned too blind an eye to the criticisms that we harbor lots of racists, dummies, and know-nothings. It's funny that The Purge commercial aired during that debate. The conservative movement needs a purge. Trump-style know-nothing populist statism is NOTHING like small government conservatism.</comment>

<comment>Bernie SUPPORTS many gun rights, coming from Vermont, where 2/3rds of the state own guns!BERNIE is actually a life-long independent. (Look him up. Seriously.)Bernie says BOTH parties are crooked and full of shit, and videos from 30 years back PROVE his story has never changed.</comment>

<comment>Um... Shillary IS a Republican, in ALL categories!(You should look into BERNIE: lifelong INDEPENDENT who has beaten BOTH GOP and DEM candidates in prior races; he only registered DEM last year for ballot access. Smart move.)(EX: Bernie has slammed Black Bush Obama many times (Obama SUCKS, says this Democrat voter) and tried to roust up a primary challenger in 2012, as even Shillary pointed out!)BERNIE says BOTH DEM/GOP Machines are DIRTY!WHO can disagree with him?I know lots of REPUBLICANS who are voting for him... just like I know many LIBS who are considering voting for Trump thanks to his Planned Parenthood defense; slams of 9/11 and The Iraq War; etc.WEIRDEST. ELECTION. EVER.BEST. ELECTION. EVER.</comment>

<comment>Even HILLARY has said it in all the debates so far:"I WAS OUTSMARTED BY W. BUSH ON IRAQ... losing you trillions... but BERNIE was much much smarter!!"</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Rubio are tag-teaming Trump.  They do not look presidential.  They look like midgets in a battle royale...</comment>

<comment>You think Trump looks presidential?  Kasich is the only one who looks presidential to me.</comment>

<comment>Yeah... until you look at  Kasich's record and policies.</comment>

<comment>Right.  And I'm left ... to the extreme.  I'm just saying how he looks.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I know – I felt the same until I read up on him. He is as batshit insane as the rest of the clowns on that stage.</comment>

<comment>he does NOT look presidential.Trump, like him or hate him, DOES look the part: VERY TALL and big.You could EASILY see him standing down Putin or ANYONE.Kasich is a dork.</comment>

<comment>Is Kasich there tonight?</comment>

<comment>very much so. you hadn't noticed?</comment>

<comment>No. Colbert is right: Kasich looks like a chumpy substitute jr high teacher.Yes, K comes off as more sane / mature... but it's a front his coaches told him to play. (ALmost worked for him!)his record proves he's just another lying psycho.</comment>

<comment>I'm so ready for Trump to Make America Great Again. Trump 2016!</comment>

<comment>Time to stop supporting the joke candidates.</comment>

<comment>Sigh. The wall again? Is Pink Floyd available?</comment>

<comment>How many Republican primary voters are shocked to find out that Puerto Ricans can come to the U.S. main land legally.</comment>

<comment>Puerto Rico citizens? Who can't vote and have no representation?</comment>

<comment>And pay no taxes!</comment>

<comment>Speaking of Puerto Rico, I always hoped Freddie Prince would be the first Hispanic presidential candidate.</comment>

<comment>Ben "Jazz Hands" Carson!</comment>

<comment>Puerto Rico se tornou Puerto Pobre, de repente.  O Donald esta dando uma porrada a esses escrotinhos.  Presidente Donald J. Trump em 2016 !</comment>

<comment>Yes, I agree: Trump is a scrotum dipped in acid.</comment>

<comment>Carson sounds like a motivational speaker.  He did everything but plug his book.</comment>

<comment>Because....hands.... are good for jerking off.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is so shiny.</comment>

<comment>And damp</comment>

<comment>The only way Trump can lose is if he slips in a puddle of Rubio's perspiration and cracks his noggin on the podium.</comment>

<comment>Marco "Canned Speech" Rubio!</comment>

<comment>Donald "Facial Expressions" Trumpet!</comment>

<comment>"On day one I will initiate an investigation into Planned Parenthood ... " Ok, you are actually insane.</comment>

<comment>To go with the multiple Congressional investigations that already exist.   What's really silly is there's no reason to believe that he wouldn't just de-fund it.</comment>

<comment>No – that is just masturbatory right wing dog whistle.Toot! Toot!</comment>

<comment>Go Trump.</comment>

<comment>Every speech that Cruz gives is for the far right.   How much more evidence does he need that the majority of the Republican primary voters aren't that conservative?</comment>

<comment>Cruz is a pander bot (or a fluffer, in cruder terms).</comment>

<comment>Right but he's got to get to 51% at some point.</comment>

<comment>Or not ...</comment>

<comment>This debate was a disaster for CNN.  They should be ashamed.</comment>

<comment>No, the candidates and Republicans are the ones who should be ashamed.</comment>

<comment>You can't put this on CNN.</comment>

<comment>it WAS the most poorly-run of them all so far. in many ways.</comment>

<comment>They didn't control the dialogue.  People were allowed to speak as long as they wanted, talk over one another, and on and on.  It was not good.</comment>

<comment>Danny Bonaduce and Tanya Harding and their cohorts on "Dumbest..." would have been a step up in class from Blitzer/Cuomo.</comment>

<comment>You would have needed Tasers to control the dialogue tonight.</comment>

<comment>Where is Diane Rehm when we need her?I once listened to her "stand down" a retired general, a guest on her show who was talking out of turn. Awesome!</comment>

<comment>they could EASILY have wolf with cutoff switches for microphones... but they WANT it to be crazy and exciting so you can see the pickle they're in... some of the BEST lines come  when someone breaks "the rules"!</comment>

<comment>why.</comment>

<comment>It was a disaster for the GOP!</comment>

<comment>much better thought.</comment>

<comment>Typical Repuke, blame others for your own failures.</comment>

<comment>Wrong.  I'm voting for Bernie.  But I know bad moderation when I see it.</comment>

<comment>CNN lost their shame years ago.</comment>

<comment>i can't stomach that they think we need to WATCH THE CANDIDATES WALK ON STAGE... then STAND THERE.... THEN watch the singer walk on stage... THEN watch her sing.... THEN we begin by explaining the "rules" (are you fucking KIDDING me??)</comment>

<comment>Somewhere, Hillary Clinton is gazing into her crystal ball, cackling hysterically.</comment>

<comment>She'll be trading "cackles" for "shackles" directly.</comment>

<comment>Wait – you forgot Trump, the obese, bald guy with the bad combover and the ludicrous tent suit.</comment>

<comment>My only regret is that I have but one up-vote to give you ;-)</comment>

<comment>The cackle of FREEDOM</comment>

<comment>WHO IS THIS "HILLARY" SOME OF YOU KEEP MENTIONING?EVERYWHERE I GO... people are voting for BERNIE SANDERS.I don't know anyone voting for this "hillary" person you mention.Oh wait! Is she the horrible candidate who was rejected by DEMOCRATS in 2008 (against an unelectable BLACK guy) (with a terrorist's name)??OH YEAH!What ever happened to that war criminal?I heard she started fucking Kissinger.</comment>

<comment>TRUMPty DUMPty just claimed he has been "audited" for the past five years because he is a "strong christian"!!!!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>He is freaking hilarious. ;-). I think he is an atheist, which is good. Too bad you cannot admit it.</comment>

<comment>The Donald is not an atheist. He worships the almighty Dollar...</comment>

<comment>Ah, at least the dollar is not a make believe supernatural entity. Well, in a way it is. </comment>

<comment>Bernie is also a clear ATHEIST, but he doesn't want to drop that bomb yet.</comment>

<comment>He has basically said he is, without using the a word. ;-)</comment>

<comment>Someone want to remind him that 'you cannot serve God and Mammon'</comment>

<comment>that WAS pretty funny.but he PULLS THIS WILD SHIT off... and you have to give him points for that!</comment>

<comment>Yep. That's the case.</comment>

<comment>Keep swallowing his spew like a cheap $25 hooker.</comment>

<comment>Atlantic AIPAC hasbara are out in force diluting the breaking news of Trump's debate victory.  Trump clearly loves these debates, and he's got Super Tuesday super-duper locked up.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the genital mutilators HATE Trump.</comment>

<comment>No matter how many craven things you post about Israel, let's remember: The muslim  world is much worse.In the Muslim  world people are slaves to their religious laws and to their dictators.In the muslim  world homosexuals are being executed. Women are being executed for being raped.Thieves get their hands chopped off. Women don't have freedom to dress as they want and speak their mind. Political opponents are arrested and executed without trial. People can get 500 brutal and barbaric lashes for all sort of crimes in the city center so that everyone could see,  including children.You are the worst of the kinds of hypocrites. You are all hypocrites liars who live in dark societies, primitive like in the middle ages.</comment>

<comment>Stop apologizing for and excusing Israel because "they are not as bad as..."They are bad. Just admit it.</comment>

<comment>Israel is the only country on the CONTINENT OF ASIA to treat gay people with a shred of decency.Israelis are rich while the syrians, iraqis, jordanians, afghanis and yemenis are poor as dirt.Israel is a superior nation.</comment>

<comment>They are genital mutilators. Israel supports genital mutilation.That is your "superior" nation.</comment>

<comment>What garbage lying source did you get that from?FGM is done 99% exclusively by Africans. ALL CHRISTIAN OR MOSLEMhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Wow – are you really that ignorant?Of course Israel supports genital mutilation – they do it to males, tiny babies only 8 days old. They slice off flesh off their penises.So yeah....genital mutilation and sex crime.</comment>

<comment>stupid, ignorant, comment.FGM is not the same as circumcision</comment>

<comment>You're surprisingly patient with that one.Just so you know, they're literally on Lithium</comment>

<comment>Who said they were the "same" aside from both being forms of genital mutilation?No my sad, pathetic, friend, it is you who is ignorant and stupid. You support some forms of genital mutilation but not others because of your ignorance, and your sick ideology.What child, male or female, should have their genitals mutilated? Smart, civilized people say none.</comment>

<comment>Your comments are idiotic. I'm done</comment>

<comment>You were done before you started your idiocy.</comment>

<comment>Your IQ is lower than Antarctic Fahrenheit temperatures </comment>

<comment>instead of BACKING UP your claim that they're different, you RAN AWAY.Game Over. Mean Girl CRUSHED YOU.</comment>

<comment>You can bring a horse to water, but....I couldn't make her drink</comment>

<comment>If that were true, you'd have LISTED AT LEAST ONE REASON WHY IT'S DIFFERENT.YOu didn't because even YOU didn't believe what you typed.</comment>

<comment>DON'T FORGET THEY ALSO SUCK THE BABY's PENISES!!LITERALLY!!! !</comment>

<comment>Then WHY do they tolerate Bigot Shillary who said "gays should NEVER have equal rights in this nation of EQUALITY"??</comment>

<comment>All your comments are idiotic, stupid, and totally worthless </comment>

<comment>HITLER: "but STALIN KILLED FIFTY million!!!!"</comment>

<comment>A woman in TelAviv by herself, safe.A woman in Cairo, run to the hotel.An Arab in Jerusalem, ok.Wear a kippa in Amman... or many Paris neighborhoodsSay you are atheist in Haifa, who cares?Say you are atheist in Ryad...</comment>

<comment>Lets face it, the longer Israel exists in that shitty part of the world the more it becomes like the rest of them, just with skullcaps instead of beheading knives.</comment>

<comment>If you lived in a sea of genocidal moslems, you would also maintain a strong army.</comment>

<comment>HITLER SAID THE EXACT SAME THING.LOOK IT UP: "we have a right to protect Germany from terrorists".BIG FAIL, herr Homo!</comment>

<comment>except Jews in Germany weren't  genocidal jihadists. Your comparison is false </comment>

<comment>did you know when a thief gets his hand cut off he has to eat alonebecause they think it's disgusting to eat with the same hand youwipe your ass with?</comment>

<comment>hand soap is as novel to them as everything else we enjoy in western civilization !</comment>

<comment>like sucking baby's cocks after you chop part of their dick off?"civilized"???WOW. No wonder ALL my jewish friends say you israelis are insane nazis!</comment>

<comment>I'm American </comment>

<comment>That... was a terrifying mental image after midnight.Thank you for that.</comment>

<comment>hahaahha, you can count on me...hahaaha</comment>

<comment>I won again. Solid. </comment>

<comment>You got banned again, apparently.But it is good that you have a hobby in your sad, lonely life.</comment>

<comment>Whine more, cuck</comment>

<comment>Yes, yes, you sad, lonely guys always attack with some sexual reference. I guess that is because you are so isolated and unwanted. Maybe you should take a bath.ha ha</comment>

<comment>Trumpzilla Destroys the Gee-oh-Pee!</comment>

<comment>Rubio and Cruz made the media happy who love the fight club circus components of these debates, but they descended into Donald's wheelhouse and so while they had a few good lines, they ended up looking the least presidential they have looked the whole cycle. Trump baited them in and they fell for it.</comment>

<comment> Cruzio was nipping at Trump's heels tonight. </comment>

<comment>Neither of them are  being sued for fraud, for running a phony online university scam. Wimps!</comment>

<comment>They've never had real jobs before.</comment>

<comment>Nice to hear trump defend planned parenthood though</comment>

<comment>Did he? Wow, makes me wish I could vote for him twice!</comment>

<comment>But they do support those phony universities getting lots of federal funds . . .</comment>

<comment>And the winner of the debate is ... Hillary Clinton.</comment>

<comment>The Oval Office will be in the Big House with her legal problems. </comment>

<comment>Better the Big House than the Nut House.</comment>

<comment>Hillary belongs there too. She's toast once he starts with her. 10/10 in attacks and wins.</comment>

<comment>UM... YOU ALL SAID HILLARY HAD 2008 LOCKED UP TOO.... remember?Good to see NONE of you can learn from the past.</comment>

<comment>SHILLARY is more hated by DEMS than the GOP hates her!</comment>

<comment>.Donald Trump = the best thing to happen to the Democratic party since Sarah Palin.</comment>

<comment>Palin has been quiet recently. Dealing with her dysfunctional family perhaps?(..because obviously she is a *great* parent... a Huuuuge parent).</comment>

<comment>She is a phony panderer. The media keeps her hid, she's not dynamic, people don't like her, and she's a criminal. Decades of corruption! Trump will destroy her!</comment>

<comment>Trump won't get NEAR Hillary.(Did you just wake from a coma? EVERY DAY Bernie grows in power and Hillary sinks further... and we're STILL this early in the game!!)</comment>

<comment>Trump is playing a game of whack-a-mole (as the mole) with liberals and winning.</comment>

<comment>Terrible night? He's way ahead on the survey of "who won" on Drudge (and also on Slate).</comment>

<comment>"Terrible night"?On one side he had Baby WaWa whining about nonsense and on the other he had the Wacko Cruz, lying about everything and anything he could think of.Trump is a clown and a bigot but I find it hard to believe that anyone would claim that he had a "terrible night".Or is thus just Atlantic's usual clickbait?</comment>

<comment>"Carson's litmus test for Supreme Court nominees: “The fruit salad of their life is what I will look at.” (Your guess is as good as anyone else’s.)"  .. in my view, this is a rewording of verse from the Bible, which is something that Dr. Carson would say. In other words, "You will know them by their fruit" [Matthew 7:16]. Basically, he would examine their record. This seems like a fair and solid statement.</comment>

<comment>I thought he was drawing an analogy to the word salad that constitutes his answers.</comment>

<comment>are you freaking kidding me?? EVERY single poll shows Donald winning, wow You are so wrong. Could you be any more biased</comment>

<comment>Robotic Rubio looked like a Cuban Chiwawa trying to ankle bite Trump and Trump just kicked his scrawny ass across the stage....lol</comment>

<comment>http://theconservativetreehous...</comment>

<comment>You mean the online trumpkin polls. The only people being polled are those losers who opt-in and live in their parent's basement. These are polls are jokes.</comment>

<comment>um, you have heard of ACTUAL VOTES (like primaries)... right?</comment>

<comment>Hey trumpkin,  what are we talking about.  Duh</comment>

<comment>Just posted David Graham's home address on ISIS's website...</comment>

<comment>That's not an overreaction at all.</comment>

<comment>Just giving my jihadi homies some fertile leads...</comment>

<comment>Seriously, this piece on Trump's "bad night" borders on journalistic malpractice. Every on-line poll, even the WSJ, has Trump rated as the winner by a 40-50 point margin.</comment>

<comment>"Every online poll" went for Ron Paul in 2012. That's how these things go.In an actual focus group (as shown on Fox), a crowd came in with most of the supporters saying they supported Trump, but when asked aftewards who won the debate they said unanimously, "Rubio."</comment>

<comment>ANOTHER LIAR who says "TRUMP IS LOSING ALL PRIMARY VOTES SO FAR! You can't trust these polls! Trump is NOT popular!"</comment>

<comment>EVERY billionaire-owned media outlet said the SAME script they always do:RUBIO WON BIG!!TRUMP LOST BIG!!and it's magnificently backfiring: nevermind just killing off Rubio... the MSM is killing off... THE MSM!Please clap!!</comment>

<comment>bit of news for youonline polls are a joke</comment>

<comment>Another debate where I won again. Undefeated!</comment>

<comment>Trump won, hands down! Robot Rubio with his high heels, big loser. Cruz held his own. Carson is not allowed to speak. Kasich did well.</comment>

<comment>Trump was left a smoldering pile of rubble with an orange hair piece on top. I've never seen such a beatdown in a political debate before. In any other debate, just one of Marco Rubio's haymakers would be the viral clip afterwards. In this debate, there were a dozen of them. It was wild. Trump wasn't just rattled, he was exposed, embarrassed, and utterly destroyed, and the 'post-game' coverage has been terrible for him. Even the Breitbart guy who is on the news networks to be...Breitbart, had to admit that Trump got stomped. Trump on CNN afterwards wasn't just rattled, he was pale, clammy, and utterly incoherent.What an awful, awful night for Trump. It was epic.</comment>
