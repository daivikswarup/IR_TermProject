<comment>White people need to chill tf out and realize things are so good for them under Obama. A white President would only ruin things.</comment>

<comment>Well killing private sector jobs did force me to bid a lot more government projects that does pay considerbly more. It's also forced me to require federal background checks, drug testing, and credit checks on all employees. It's been over six years since I've had a black employee now. Things are going great!</comment>

<comment>This is a funny post.</comment>

<comment>And you think a Republican president would not have you doing background checks, or drug screening or credit checks on your employees for federal projects?Both comment and reply are silly.</comment>

<comment>No I think I'd still be busy with commercial projects and allow to hire qualified workers. Instead it takes months to find help and there's excellent help that I can't send to jobsites.For perspective a single wide 32" commercial glass door and closer cost under $1000 and takes about four hours to install. Commercially it would bid out close to $2000-2300 range, federally we got that bid accepted at $8900.It's a nice bump in pay but guess who's footing the bill.</comment>

<comment>Well how does the increased pay integrate with the incompetent help? Does the door take 2 days to install now? What's the take-home about having incompetent help and no black employees - black people do drugs but are better workers?</comment>

<comment>Not to mention he is basically admitting to overcharging us taxpayers. It's like committing medicare fraud and blaming the government for letting you get away with it.</comment>

<comment>Well yeah, there's that, but he's in good company there. Paul Ryan, I'm lookin at ya!</comment>

<comment>Blacks folks need to stop judging people by the color of their skin.</comment>

<comment>He's Slovakian, not black.</comment>

<comment>that fact doesn't mitigate my comment, as surely you can see based on what he's saying here.</comment>

<comment>Yea this January my net worth dropped only 10% SO FAR.  I am looking forward to retiring on dog food, I hear it is low in sodium and cholesterol.</comment>

<comment>Run don't walk down to your Black Panther recruiting office and see what it gets you! Why not hold your racisim in check rather than spout off in such a stupid way?</comment>

<comment>You, my friend, are hallucinating!</comment>

<comment>A preeminently racist point of view. Minister you say? Related to Wright perhaps?</comment>

<comment>Terror is a useful word here: chronic anxiety is addictive and will always seek a succession of substitutes. American consumer capitalism actively cultivates chronic anxiety in people so that they seek the (very temporary) alleviation of anxiety promised by consumption. This is the basic grid of our culture now.</comment>

<comment>I think your irony-meter is on the fritz. You should have one of Trump's imported IT guys look into that for you.</comment>

<comment>Obama was a decent president. He is reasonable, thoughtful, and careful. Like Bush before him, the amount of crisis and problems in the country prevented a lot of good getting done. He would have been a better president in a better time.</comment>

<comment>Obama has been a disappointment to the left and not wanted by the right.  As for the middle, they are  lukewarm on him.  Nuf said about O.</comment>

<comment>as far as the left being disappointed, i haven't seen any polling that could safely speak for the entirety of the left so i'll disagree.</comment>

<comment>No single payer, no public option.  those alone are cause for great disappointment.  But the list is long.</comment>

<comment>How about all those unemployed black kids. Right, they are too stupid to realize their black hero is incompetent.</comment>

<comment>don't quite get your point; sounds like you're being sarcastic but not sure.  nowadays sarcasm is hard to detect.</comment>

<comment>Kool.</comment>

<comment>The president's approval numbers are not bad, given the usual mess the world is in.  Only two presidents since WWII (that is, from Truman to Obama), never went below 50%:  Eisenhower and Kennedy, and Kennedy was not in office long enough for Americans to get restless.  That leaves Ike.Being president is a helluva job (even sunny Reagan dropped into the 30% range at one point), not one that normally wins friends easily.  Dan</comment>

<comment>Not sure your point.  I'm a leftie who likes Ike, by the way, and am old enough to remember him and even saw him as a kind of father figure in grade school.JFK was always overrated.  Camelot and all that you know.</comment>

<comment>Obama compared to JFK.  That's a laugh.</comment>

<comment>Ah . . . not crazy about either of them.</comment>

<comment>"...Obama was a decent president..."If you thought he was really any good - you wouldn't have been so quick to use the past tense.</comment>

<comment>I thought that commenter in Notes earlier today actually put it really well. Don't vote for a candidate's promises; vote for your measure of their intelligence and tenor. 70 consecutive months of positive job growth. That alone is worth enough to ignore the haranguing ideologues.</comment>

<comment>True, but he crashed the economy before he even took office. I mean, who does that?</comment>

<comment>I like his forethought in arranging a real estate bubble before he even took national office. That's the kind of quantum chess-playing we need more of!</comment>

<comment>You mean like how he arranged for that birth notice to appear in that Hawaiian newspaper over 54 years ago in order to fool everyone that he wasn't born in Kenya? Pure genius!</comment>

<comment>More proof he is a bumbling incompetent evil genius manipulator who can't get anything done, but has willfully ruined the entire country, nay, the world.edited for extended snark</comment>

<comment>He willfully ruined the country, it was not his incompetence, and it certainly didn't take genius.  Destroying a bridge is easier than building one.</comment>

<comment>You and Esther deserve each other.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the country is ruined. Bring back W. Bush. We need more stock market crashes, deficits, unemployment and 9/11s.</comment>

<comment>Bush didn't cause the stock market crash, ask any economist or read a book, moron.</comment>

<comment>I especially like the imams' foresight in naming him "Barack" so as to make his un-Americanness so obvious that we would think that he couldn't possibly be un-American.</comment>

<comment>You don't remember the whole Barry thing?</comment>

<comment>No, but he did arrange for the world to be fooled as to who his real (biological) father was.</comment>

<comment>When will people learn or admit that something that happens when a guy is President does not mean it happened as a result of him unless of course you are going to give him credit for Uber hiring drivers.</comment>

<comment>Part time and low paying jobs. Yippee!</comment>

<comment>What was the unemployment rate when W. Bush took office? and when he left?</comment>

<comment>Most of his terms had full employment, and don't be an idiot and blame the recession on him. It just screams ignorance.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't we all be better in a better time?</comment>

<comment>I'm commenting here because Mr. Coates, as is his wont, has no space to comment.  He either closes his commentary or never has it in the first place.  Great democracy at work.Well, what to say here?  Obama wants out of the Middle East--a bit late for that, grossly late, but better than staying in.</comment>

<comment>You sound like an entitled child, not everyone has to hear your thoughts, my thoughts or anyone's.Comments sections are dying off, you know that right?</comment>

<comment>Like everything, I got to comments sections too late...that sucks.</comment>

<comment>Rationalization city, huh El?comments dying out?  I think not.</comment>

<comment>Not really, the "end comments sections" movement has been growing. Look at CNN and the Daily Beast.</comment>

<comment>hardly comprehensive.  Anyway, El, let's move on before we both start to bore each other.  Cheerio until next time.</comment>

<comment>I never read Coates' articles on principle for that reason. Don't give him the clicks.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, if I'm not allowed to smear feces on something, I won't read it either. That will show them.</comment>

<comment>I hope you don't practice your literacy skills on friends and family too much.</comment>

<comment>Well you have higher principles than I.  you see I make comments not for the writer but for the other commenters and readers.</comment>

<comment>I will do that sometimes if the writer indulges in an urban myth in need of debunking.</comment>

<comment>Good idea.</comment>

<comment>This is a privately held news site.   You are a consumer.  What does it have to do with democracy?</comment>

<comment>The ethos of the web is not BROADCAST - it is two-way dialogue.Maybe you should go back to the TV days - it might suit you better.</comment>

<comment>It's a commercial transaction.  You're not entitled to anything other than to consume a different product if this one doesn't suit you.</comment>

<comment>Clueless. You sound old - like Dick Cheney.</comment>

<comment>You appear to be confused about products and markets.  The Atlantic is a product.  You are nothing more than a consumer of that product.  Don't like the product.  Consume something else.</comment>

<comment>That's probably why you are divorced, Terri. You told your husband that you were a product, and if he didn't like it - he should consume something else. (:-)</comment>

<comment>A kernel of truth is required for a slam.  This is a swing and a miss.</comment>

<comment>You get the most flak when you are directly over the target.</comment>

<comment>Jesus H. Christ on a Sybian, man, that's a fucking out-of-line comment, even for you.</comment>

<comment>Ahhh chill out. She is not divorced. I'm just responding to her dumb comment with an even dumber and nonsensical comment.</comment>

<comment>That is waaaay over the line, Mr. Potato Head. Guess some dickless wonders just can't handle it when a woman is right.</comment>

<comment>There's no fairness doctrine, liberal.  Get used to the free market.</comment>

<comment>Nathan Brittles, is that you? You scamp, you got a new sockpuppet account, didn't you?</comment>

<comment>Nonsense, liberal.  I trust you're not so blind as to notice there was no long line of periods in my original post.I may have taken inspiration from Nathan, tho ........................................</comment>

<comment>And what a stellar role model he is...I mean, you are...damn. This whole sockpuppet thing is confusing.  And just to repeat, I told him, I mean you (see what I mean?) a long time ago that calling me a liberal isn't nearly the insult you, I mean he, seems to think it is. As long as liberal denotes the opposite of what belligerent, know-nothing types like you espouse, I'm proud to be called a liberal.</comment>

<comment>Come on Terri you gotta be smarter than that.</comment>

<comment>I am. It appears you are not.  Disappointing.</comment>

<comment>Still like your online drawing though.</comment>

<comment>Don't hate on you. Just don't agree with you.</comment>

<comment>Thanks. It's the best representation I can come up with in the virtual world for me.</comment>

<comment>Why not your photo there.  I don't have one because I'm too lazy to learn how to do it.</comment>

<comment>Privacy. I want to be as close as I can to the 'real' me without being  easily identifiable.  Being readily identifiable on line would conflict with my job.</comment>

<comment>Actually my teeth are rather good, but of course not perfect, nobody has such teeth, which I suppose was my original point.</comment>

<comment>Did I miss a recent Coates article on Obama?</comment>

<comment>You missed my point.  I'm commenting on the other article today by Coates.  See what I mean?</comment>

<comment>Coates closed his comment section because he wanted it to be a place where reasoned discourse could take place. Instead, it became a place where some variation of the same three things would be said over and over regardless of the subject at hand:  1) I never owned any slaves. 2) But what about BLACK ON BLACK CRIME?!?!CHICAGO!!1!  and 3) It's really the blacks who are most racist.Those three things, and their variants, were addressed and discussed in depth over and over, ad nauseam, for a couple of years. Finally (and who can blame him?) he got sick of it and closed comments. And the very people who caused comments to close have complained about it ever since.</comment>

<comment>And why is it people never complain about Goldberg or Fallows? Hell, Fallows never had comments -- for precisely the reason TNC closed his -- and Goldberg closed his within a year the first time he was at The Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>But.. but.. aren't they going to miss shining examples like at the top of this thread (oldest setting) where some idiot right winger parodies a liberal strawman, and his unwitting ideological brethren try to troll him with their usual stale garbage "arguments"?</comment>

<comment>Dream on, dave in texas.  I never had such opinions and barely managed to get a few probing comments in before his commentaries were closed.  After awhile I only saw them closed all the time, or, as in this one, never opened in the first place.Wanna try again?</comment>

<comment>Stock ?  Like chicken stock ?</comment>

<comment>Like they said in the 1970s "jive turkey" stock.</comment>

<comment>I actually can speak some jive. Yah dig ?</comment>

<comment>Better tell the pilot, quick.</comment>

<comment>Can you speak Carny?</comment>

<comment>Surely there must be something you can do?</comment>

<comment>Nope.  I can go unwashed for days on end though.  That's at least living like them.</comment>

<comment>I have man parts and I'm not addicted to meth.</comment>

<comment>Wait....it's have you ever seen.  Of course you have.</comment>

<comment>"...Obama mentioned... nor the Afghan War. Both were ambitious, American-dominated, efforts to remake a far-off corner of the greater Middle East...".Yeah, the Pew Surveys report that 99% of Afghans support Shariah Law.  That's right. US troops have been fighting and dying to prevent the Taliban from taking over and imposing Shariah law on behalf of the one percent of the Afghan population that would rather do things American-style.</comment>

<comment>This doesn't really mean anything since sharia law differs radically from place to place and how its employed. It can mean anything from Saudi Arabia to using the Qu'ran in civil law.</comment>

<comment>Yup, he should have made a much cleaner break with the wars and foreign policies he inherited from his predecessor. The Republicans and much of the public would have crucified him, but the person willing to be a one-termer on purpose is a rare bird indeed.</comment>

<comment>That's quite an understatement - saying he should have made a cleaner break. I mean - the guy campaigned on doubling the size of the US involvement- and he carried out that promise.The Bush policy was a big failure - and therefore, the Obama policy was double the Bush failure.  He came to the casino table and instead of walking away - he doubled down and turned a $100,000 loss into a $200,000 loss.What Bush should have done was bombed the sh*t out of the Taliban in both Afghanistan and Pakistan - with the goal of causing a huge amount of casualties. And then finished.  Simple payback for 9/11.</comment>

<comment>I don't agree that Obama's failure was double Bush's failure. If we've learned one thing from the last 60 years of foreign policy, it's that foreign entanglements have an inertia that is hard to resist. Bush put us there for that long, so I mostly blame him. The Afghan Surge was just an ill-begotten attempt to correct an existing problem. Dumb, but not as collocally dumb as the whole Bush enterprise in Central Asia. More importantly, the real debacle of the Bush presidency was in Iraq, not Afghanistan. Rather than bombing, which doesn't really work well in those mountains, I would have settled for closing the ring at Tora Bora rather than diverting resources to gear up for Bush's main purpose all along - the deposition of Saddam Hussein. In any case, I think nation building in places where there is virtually no pro-American sentiment is an absurd exercise regardless of who's in office.</comment>

<comment>"The country, in Obama’s view, has regained its balance. Unfortunately for him, large chunks of the American public have not."Even more unfortunate for the people comprising those chunks of the public.</comment>

<comment>President Obama's speech was wonderful. People tend to forget that he has to work with a Congress that has had no intention of working with him on anything. What he has got done he has done basically on his own where he can. Republicans have been and continue to be obstructionists and will not give our president any credit for anything that he has done even when it's good. They are like a bunch of petulant children who if they can't have their own way they kick and scream and sulk. He has kept our country safe, we have not had thank God an attack on a scale anywhere near like what we had on 911. High profile terrorists have been either killed or are in jail but this is not seen as anything to be proud of in the eyes of Republicans. How quickly they forget that George Bush came on T.V and actually said that he didn't think/care about Osama Bin Laden anymore! Are you kidding me? The guy who masterminded 911! Can you imagine the response had President Obama said that? ACA, although not perfect was historical and must never be taken away which is what Republicans want to do and have no earthly clue what they would replace it with. All jobs lost have been regained and unemployment is down dramatically to what it was. The Iran deal was a big deal but if left to Republicans we would have bombed them years ago alongside God knows how many more other countries. So all in all President Obama's done a great job with the hand he was dealt and I for one couldn't be more proud of him.</comment>

<comment>OMG this so much. Obama is great and the only thing better than Obama is our diversity which makes us super duper stronger and totally prevents us from being divided along racial religious or ethnic lines. Republicans should embrace diversity and they will be so strong too.</comment>

<comment>Republicans were going to do an autopsy even Reince Preibus realized that was much needed. Well that has worked out well as they haven't changed one iota.  As for diversity I don't think they even know what that means. Have you seen the crowds at Trumps events and others come to think of it? Still full of generally older white people. A few young people but very few minorities. Sadly the Republican party is still the party of the older generation and white. That is a fact. The HUGE crowds Trump loves to brag about prove it over and over.</comment>

<comment>I found it ironic that this president --  The Great Divider -- was lecturing the GOP on the tone of politics.  Obama has damaged political discourse in the USA beyond repair.  He has damaged trust in high office beyond repair.  There is always an opposition party and the GOP behaved like the opposition always does.   If you did not agree with anything Obama ever said or did, then you were branded a racist.  We were promised "hope and change".  Look what we got.  We got hate.</comment>

<comment>yeah, that hate? it's a two way street.</comment>

<comment>According to Dems, if you are opposed to open borders then you are engaging in hate.  This is nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Migration is a human right. Also cell phones, high speed internet, and non culturally appropriative cafeteria food.</comment>

<comment>i don't believe that's true.</comment>

<comment>So, can you please tell me how the GOP is engaging in hate?  I am not a Republican.</comment>

<comment>i never said they were.  now, are their politicians in both parties who have engaged in hate?  absolutely.</comment>

<comment>Oh please, stop with your tiresome right wing rhetoric. Obama tried to engage the GOP most of his time in office. Or is it  that for you yahoos, simply the fact that he is not white makes him "The Great Divider"?</comment>

<comment>I voted for Obama.  Twice.  But I am white, so that does make me "right wing" now, thanks to the political discourse ushered in by The Great Divider.</comment>

<comment>"I voted for Obama.  Twice."Why do you right wing trolls persist in making that claim?</comment>

<comment>Why do you Social Justice Warriors come back after you have been banned?  Can't you tell no one wants to hear from you?</comment>

<comment>Hey Gramps, you are just full of right wing troll whine today, aren't you?</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. How sad that you have no life outside the Atlantic forum, Grampy. Were you banned from bingo for being a  disagreeable troll?</comment>

<comment>I have had one Disqus account, this is it.</comment>

<comment>Ok, Grampy. But why were you banned from bingo?Ha ha, you sad troll. Get a life</comment>

<comment>Why reply? He's a fool.</comment>

<comment>It's not just that he failed to engage the Republicans, he also failed to engage the people.Obamacare had to be shoved thru a democratic Congress without public support using payoffs and deception.  Massachusetts even went so far as to elect a Republican to the Senate to strangle the ACA in it;s crib.Nothing has unified the people of this country and the international community like the opposition to the Iran deal, yet Obama got his way.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. What utter nonsense. Is that what your right wing hate radio has been telling you?(hint: MA had RomneyCare for years before the ACA)But keep whining – it makes us normal people smile.</comment>

<comment>I didn't realize that there were deniers out there on this.from the globe " the poll shows Massachusetts’ independent voters — the largest bloc in the state, at 52 percent — to oppose by a two-to-one margin President Barack Obama’s signature initiative, his universal healthcare proposal. Brown is against Obama’s measure"RomneyCare does not equal ACA</comment>

<comment>Yawn. Keep spouting nonsense. it amuses us.</comment>

<comment>Obama -> second coming of GWB</comment>

<comment>They were both addicted to budget deficits and open borders.</comment>

<comment>And yet you claim you "voted for him twice"...ha ha. Isn't it time for your bingo, Grampy?</comment>

<comment>Do you think I voted for Bush?  You must not read very well.</comment>

<comment>Time for your Jello, Grampy, you are making even less sense than usual.</comment>

<comment>This is just dumb.</comment>

<comment>Obama was dealt a pretty tough hand walking into the presidency. Looking at the country now and looking at the country 8 years ago, it's amazing how far we've come.I truly believe that people have forgotten the fear of eight years years and how Bush had basically checked out and kept the system afloat long enough to get the hell out.Individuals are struggling, but the country is strong and that creates the foundation for a better tomorrow, if we're willing to fight for one.</comment>

<comment>“… it's amazing how far we've come.”All in spite of Obama, not because of him</comment>

<comment>If you understand the the economic stimulus, the ACA's economic stimulus, Obama's appointments to the Fed, saving Detroit, and energy investment; it's improbable to come to that conclusion.Your opinion is an ideological point of view, not a logical one.</comment>

<comment>Ha, let me finish laughing</comment>

<comment>Amazing how conservatives demand they're right, yet continually fail to do anything other than demand they're right.You've never actually offered anything close to intellectual insight? Are you paid to be here, otherwise your kind of wasting your life by failing do anything remotely productive.</comment>

<comment>Sorry not done laughing</comment>

<comment>It's okay, you'll never be done. Laughing is your only defense. I guess you have insults as well, a real intellectual double-threat  ;-)</comment>

<comment>That obama has done nothing positive for america? That is a fact</comment>

<comment>That is not a fact, that is an assertion, a demand that you are correct. Glad you stopped laughing long enough to prove my point."Amazing how conservatives demand they're right, yet continually fail to do anything other than demand they're right."</comment>

<comment>You had no point, just an incorrect opinion</comment>

<comment>Your failure to understand, participate, or refute any of the conversation is noted.</comment>

<comment>That obama has ruined america? </comment>

<comment>The stimulus didn't stimulate , the country is more divided now than at any point since the 1960's, and his foreign policy adventures have been overall failures.Your opinion is an ideological point of view, not a logical one.</comment>

<comment>Liberals having logic?</comment>

<comment>The idea that $787 billion dollars pumped into an economy doesn't create stimulus, is a ridiculous notion.Stimulus aside, the economic confidence caused by an infusing  of nearly a trillion dollars has its own effects.</comment>

<comment>So then, you acknowledge that the nation is more divided now than at any point since the 1960's and that his foreign policy adventures have been overall failures. You're correct.</comment>

<comment>Nope. The country is more divided because economic structures in place long before Obama, created a low wage service sector that has created a greater parity of the white working class with minority communities.Leading the white working class community to anger that their living standards have dropped while other have risen.</comment>

<comment>So then, Obama gets to take credit for that which has "succeeded" and takes no  responsibility for that which has "failed." Yep, that's Obama's narcissistic character in a nutshell. And you enable it.Your opinion is an ideological point of view, not a logical one.</comment>

<comment>Obama can take credit for that which has succeeded in some measure due to policies he championed, as I've described.Blaming Obama for not fixing every problem in America is faultfinding. It's not logical to say that any failure deriving from limited time & resources, creates an overall failure.Your ideological madness demands you find any fault or problem in order to discredit his ideas, it is not logically driven.</comment>

<comment>I didn't blame Obama for every problem in America. Yours is a straw man argument. And in that you are acting like Obama.You should be thanking companies like Anadarko for the economic recovery, not Obama's policies which did little or nothing constructive, and in some cases were counterproductive.Your opinions are ideologically driven, and your psychological projection is noted.</comment>

<comment>The ACA implosion will accelerate next year – as planned and expected.</comment>

<comment>If liberals go we will have a better america</comment>

<comment>The problem is that while we keep thinking that this economy will strengthen and start to take off, that is not going to happen.  Believe it or not, this 'recovery' has about run it's course and we are heading back to recession.Economic cycles are fairly predictable, of course the economy is better today than it was during a recession, the goal is aught to be to get all the losses back during the recovery and be ready for the next recession.  That is the failure.</comment>

<comment>The events that might trigger another recession are not in evidence. Private debt is low, & inflation is low. No obvious bubbles. Recessions don't happen because of calendars. They happen when we overheat.</comment>

<comment>Guess that you have not been watching China or listening to the Fed talk about how to raise interest rates.Inflation is being captured at the asset level vs. consumer prices.  Take a look at the S&P or commercial real estate.Oh, and the Oil bubble just burst.</comment>

<comment>China's stock market, which has almost zero US investment, is shaky. Inflation is nearly non existent. Cheap oil is generally not a precursor to inflation. It usually leads to higher growth.I'm not saying some event could not trigger a panic that creates a recession. But I don't see why we need to get into one soon. I do worry about the Fed raising interest rates. That could do it.</comment>

<comment>The problem with China is not equity investments, the major banks have somewhere between 200 and 700 Trillion USD exposure to China.</comment>

<comment>In 2013, I always said the US  would be back in recession around 2017 because around the typical 10 year business cycle of slowdown. That's a problem to be solved by the next Congress & President to determine the length and severity and solutions, more than it is Obama's.Also, you can't get the economy back to where it was before the recession, because it was propped up by a housing bubble and before that, a tech bubble. Pre-recession prosperity was a lie.Weakening consumers was the state of the economy long before 2009, pretending that Obama could stabilize the economy, add jobs, and rebuild the middle class with an intransigent Congress, is crazy.</comment>

<comment>crazy but that is what he ran on</comment>

<comment>That's what everyone runs on. No one is going to vote for the guy that says he can't fix the middle class.</comment>

<comment>We will know how well Obama has done 10 years from now when the true cost of Obamacare is known, the extent to which he failed in the Middle East and whether the economy really grew or was it the Fed priming the pump for so many years.  Other than the unknowns, much remained the same.  The rich got richer, the poor are still poor, blacks are still at the bottom economically, socially and every other bad measurement, Asian are still leading the pack, immigration is still broke, the tax code sucks, technology is killing jobs....etc...etc....and last but not least, our politicians and people running the country still sucks.</comment>

<comment>Obama has failed</comment>

<comment>Obama believes that man can change the climate .....Obama is obviously an uneducated_moron.</comment>

<comment>Eight years of perpetual war, thousands of innocent civilians assassinated for thought crimes with a drone terrorism campaign (including US citizens), Libya is destroyed and devolving to a failed state, four years of trying to do the same in Syria, Guantanamo still open, still at war in Iraq, still at war in Afghanistan, bombing Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Israel still blindly supported, tens of thousands of "moderate rebels" armed with US weapons . . . And as a final parting gift, he's leaving us with a $1 trillion tab to build an entire new nuclear arsenal.  http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01...But yeah, he's been great.</comment>

<comment>The country, in Obama’s view, has regained its balance. Unfortunately for him, large chunks of the American public have not.=======Specifically, blue collar white men in rural areas. They got hit hard by manufacturing offshoring and Bush's economic collapse. They've also been whipped into a frenzy over the rise of minorities by right wing propaganda. Just look at a Trump rally. That tells the whole story. Hearing a "seig heil" is not really a surprise.</comment>

<comment>you mean the Pelosi, Reid, Dodd, Frank collapse</comment>

<comment>Unemployment among young African-Americans has increased under Obama.   More women live in poverty.     Household wealth has declined and healthcare is more expensive. </comment>

<comment>Increased African American unemployment? More women in poverty? Household wealth decline? Ooops! You're describing the long reaching fallout from Bush's total economic collapse and resulting severe recession.</comment>

<comment>All economic indicators are lagging because of Obama .... but hey ..... it looks like he's going to attack the overpaid professors to make college affordable.I can get behind that.</comment>

<comment>Name them....</comment>
