<comment>I am mighty tempted.</comment>

<comment>Take a look around the world, revolutions rarely produce the desired results.</comment>

<comment>Sure they do.  Chaos is a ladder.</comment>

<comment>Ok, Littlefinger!</comment>

<comment>Yes. Let's keep quiet and let misery preside.</comment>

<comment>What about 1776?</comment>

<comment>How true!</comment>

<comment>Nobody is asking for a revolution. Bernie for President is hardly a revolution. It is electing a Senator who has been serving for over 10 years and was a representative before.</comment>

<comment>Giving up is not an option.</comment>

<comment>Electing a candidate in a democratic process is by definition not a revolution.</comment>

<comment>I am voting for the nice Jewish Lady Doctor who won't continue bombing the hell out of Muslims in the Mid East.Guess why you haven't heard of her.</comment>

<comment>If Dr Ruth Westheimer is running she got my vote.  Remarkable woman.</comment>

<comment>Jill Stein.Dr. Ruth made cucumbers very popular.Being dead, she would make an excellent president, one we could all trust.</comment>

<comment>What?! Dr. Ruth isn't dead!!</comment>

<comment>SHE IS RISEN!!!HALLELUJAH BROTHER!</comment>

<comment>I didn't even know she was sick...</comment>

<comment>I didn't know the was so damned healthy.</comment>

<comment>Although I find your ideas intriguing and wish to subscribe to your news letter please be aware that Dr RW and her garden are still very much alive.  : )</comment>

<comment>damn you Insurance Panda, damn you.</comment>

<comment>HA! Insurance Panda! This one isn't as good as calling Trump a "vaginal success". But thanks for the yucks, anyway.</comment>

<comment>While I admire your passion, please bear in mind there are structural limitations to Presidential power. We don't live in a parliamentarian system where the prime minister embodies both law making (policy creating) and executive (policy implementation) power.The US President is accountable for executing the laws (or implementing policies) from the Congress.  While this is a great power--how legislation is implemented as regulation is a big deal--without the law making powers the President can't drive the policy making bus.   The only way for policies to change in the US is to change Congress and write new laws.</comment>

<comment>Congress WILL be changed once we get corporate money out if it.....which, coincidentally, Sanders is fighting to achieve. You know, those corporations that have given Clinton millions upon millions over the past three decades?</comment>

<comment>I'm not a constitutional scholar, but here's what I understand.The Supreme Court struck down the Bi-Partisan Campaign Reform Act (BCRA) otherwise known as McCain-Feingold in "Citizens United" and conflated money with speech.This action by SCOTUS means that the regulations which were created under authority of BCRA were rendered null and void.   Without a mandate from Congress the President (and the executive branch) cannot act.   If the country wishes to reimpose some semblance control on campaign finances it will require an act of Congress.You'll need to explain to me how the President figures into this picture.</comment>

<comment>It'll really require a constitutional amendment.</comment>

<comment>... and if I recall, doesn't that require Congress to act? https://www.archives.gov/feder...</comment>

<comment>There are two ways to amend the Constitution. So far only one has been used. The second one does not require Congress to act in any way, a cinch for that august body.All 27 Amendments have been ratified after two-thirds of the House and Senate approve of the proposal. it is then sent to the states for a vote. Three-fourths of the states must affirm the proposed Amendment.The other method requires a Constitutional Convention to be called by two-thirds of the legislatures of the States. That Convention can propose as many amendments as it deems necessary. Those amendments must be approved by three-fourths of the states.</comment>

<comment>I stand corrected.Although It seems from a level of effort perspective the constitutional convention is far, far, far more challenging.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, the effort would be considerable, which accounts for why it has never been used.However, how much effort would it take to get anything done through the U.S. Congress, unless it was a tax cut for the 0.1%, or a deregulation or something else that benefits they who finance "our" Congress members? Care to ask Obama?Also, with the GOP controlling so many state governments, the right might use the convention method to make amendments that, say, eliminated any and all regulation of private business. I am sure they have thought of it. Appreciate your astute comments.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, I appreciate your comments as well.Something I've always wondered about is if turnout went up if that, in and of itself, wouldn't blunt money in politics.Today you can pretty much predict the way partisans are going to vote. If they're on your team they vote for you.At low levels of turnout, since the only people left in the voting pool are mostly partisans. Elections become less about debating policy and persuasion and more about getting as many members of your team to vote.  The other side are no longer patriotic citizens with different opinions, but "enemies."It's my sense that the big money folks like this state of affairs. Dividing the citizenry helps insure that citizens won't discover that they have shared interests.  Also, and perhaps more importantly, low turnout makes elections predictable meaning that big money donors aren't "wasting" their money on losers but investing those dollars with people who will have positions of power.Now lets say turnout went up to 80%-100%.  All elections outcomes would suddenly be extremely volatile.  And it creates an "investment" problem for the big money donors. At this point what do you do? Do you bet on everyone? No one? Concentrate all your firepower on one candidate?   For the candidates this changes the kind of campaigns they run. Now they can't just appeal to their team they must start trying to persuade the other side to support them.I guess long story short, my personal opinion is that the quickest way to blunt money in politics to to inject anyone and everyone (irrespective of political beliefs) into the voting process.</comment>

<comment>I was going to answer your wondering about voter turnout but one of my nightmares is came true in an email from Common Cause. See below.First, though, voting should be mandatory as in Australia, with fines for non-compliance. And it should be on the weekend, preferably Sunday, when most working people can vote. When Americans are surveyed broadly on many issues the results are virtually always in favor of the progressive position, often overwhelmingly, e.g. 75 to 80 percent saying they want single-payer/Medicare for all. But, those people must be staying home on election day, which lets the right wingers say America is going or already is conservative. No, It isn't, but they've got you by the election results in which their passionate (read fanatic) supporters show up and vote as instructed.I'm totally on with your logic and conclusion: When everyone votes it becomes much more difficult for the big money folks to own the race...and the winners.Here's what showed up from Common Cause, looking for a petition signature:"The same Big Money forces buying our elections are trying to rewrite our Constitution -- and they’ve almost succeeded. They're working with groups like ALEC (the corporate lobby disguised as a charity) to ram a so-called “constitutional convention” through state legislatures1."Exploiting obscure provisions of Article V of our Constitution, they’d grant delegates unprecedented and unlimited power with zero checks or balances. In other words: political ideologues could enact their entire agenda without voter input -- costing the rest of us our fundamental rights and liberties."This ALEC-led campaign has already succeeded in 27 of the 34 states they need. And, they’ve got the money and organization to go over the top this year. That means we’ll be fighting back in states like South Carolina, Wisconsin, Virginia, and more -- and we want you on our side."Having 27 of the 34 needed states in your pocket is frightening and it should be. What would we do if we saw someone we've known and loved all our lives being abducted, kidnapped? America is almost in the van.</comment>

<comment>The president appoint supreme court justices.</comment>

<comment>This doesn't really answer the question about how a President could affect policy change without the assistance of  Congress.Keep in mind that SCOTUS can't overturn a ruling unless a court case makes it to them.</comment>

<comment>Bernie has said that if he becomes President he will only appoint Supreme Court Justices who oppose the Citizens United decision.  So if he becomes President and appoints a Justice who replaces a Justice who voted for Citizens United it will be easy to find a party that opposed Citizens United to bring a lawsuit once that is achieved.  Of course 2 conditions are necessary for that to happen and one or both may not occur.</comment>

<comment>Appointing new justices to SCOTUS that are pro campaign finance reform is great, but in order for them to act they would need a case to hear.   In order for them to have a case to hear there would need to be a lawsuit.   And in order for there to be a lawsuit, the law would need to restrict campaign spending in force a legal challenge from the untrammeled spending crowd.  FWIW: this is the strategy that the pro-life/anti-abortion activists have used to constrain reproductive rights.  Such a strategy could be used over a period of ~30-40 years to iteratively shave back the right.... now to make this happen you would need control over congress or a state legislature. Again ... congress et al matters because that's the branch that sets policy.</comment>

<comment>As Jim Hightower has pointed out Sanders has said "I will not be elected unless there is a huge increase in voter turnout."  With that huge increase there should be an increased vote for Democrats for Congress over and above the increased turnout in a Presidential election year.  That would mean Democratic control of the Senate which is all that's needed to approve Supreme Court Justices.  As to grounds for a lawsuit it could be anybody whose freedom of speech is overwhelmed by the overwhelming political spending of super PACs.  Four present justices voted against Citizens United.  It would take only one new appointee replacing any of the other 5 two of whom have their 80th birthdays this year for that vote to happen,</comment>

<comment>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought the 1st amendment only applies to government restrictions on free speech.</comment>

<comment>Well by the Citizens United decision was made by part of the government.</comment>

<comment>Let me clarify here's  the first ammendement:Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievancesNow I'm not a constitutional scholar but all this seems to says is that congress can't do anything to prevent you from exercising your right. It says nothing about all voices being heard equally.  (FWIW: voting is were we're all equal).In Citizens United (terrible decision btw) SCOTUS found that the Federal limits imposed by BCRA abridged the petitioner's ability to engage in political speech.Now that there's no law that's abridging speech  --- I'm not sure how you get to the court to overturn the decision.</comment>

<comment>If they want to they will.  The Roberts Court has already told the people bringing the suit to reframe the terms of the suit which is how the most effective Section of the Voting Rights Act was invalidated.  However, this is a theoretical discussion.  First Bernie Sanders has to be elected President and the odds are still against his winning the nomination.  Second if he is elected one of the Justices who voted for Citizens United will have to leave the Court and be replaced.  Since 2 of them turn 80 this year that may be more likely but both events have to occur for this to be considered.</comment>

<comment>Your comment on the VRA is exactly my point.The courts (SCOTUS is the last stop) perform judicial review on existing laws. They make law by clarifying definitions and the scope of the law.  In the case of the VRA various southern states keep challenging portions of the VRA with the aim of limiting scope.  You saw the activities in the cases around the PPACA (Obamacare) the court clarified the meaning things such as state exchange and it classified the mandates and fines.In the case of Citizens United struck down the campaign finance bits in BCRA (McCain Feingold).  What this means is that there nothing upon which SCOTUS can perform judicial review.To mount a challenge through the courts that could eventually lead the court to overturn its previous decision, we would need a pass a new law that would (hopefully) end up being reviewed by the courts.So, going all the way back up the thread, this is why I keep saying that if you want to change polices in the US you change the policy making branch in the US Government --  the legislative branch.  The president (or governor for that matter) cannot act unless provided a legislative mandate through the law.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the information.  However, doesn't the Supreme Court decide to consider a case if at least 4 Justices agree to consider it?  Aren't some cases proposed directly to the Supreme Court although they are almost always rejected?  A Supreme Court determined to reverse the decision could accept one of them?  If that's not correct prospects look remote.  However, if the Republicans nominate Cruz for President the public may react like they did with Barry Goldwater and drag the entire Republican ticket down which would not only give the Democrats the Senate but even possibly the House in spite of the gerrymandering.  The same thing might happen if Trump is the nominee but the reaction is not as likely to be that strong.  Otherwise we will have to wait for the 2020 redistricting in a Presidential election year.</comment>

<comment>There's a reason why SCOTUS is the highest court in the land, it's at the very, very, very end of a marathon appeals process.   And on appeal is how most cases get there. The only cases the court can hear directly are disagreements between states, state/federal gov't, and lawsuits against countries.Again, for the most part, to get a case to be heard by SCOTUS it would need to go to federal court (ie. federal laws).  And, as i said, given that there is no longer a law or regulation to violate (they were struck down) I don't even know how you make a case.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the clarification.  If you are correct it is discouraging.</comment>

<comment>6 coin tosses, and she wins all of them? LOL Rigged buddy, rigged!</comment>

<comment>What, you don't trust stage magicians?</comment>

<comment>An initial primary "won" by coin tosses points out the pathetic nature of the U.S. Presidential election process.   May as well determine the president by a coin toss.</comment>

<comment>Given how problematic the Iowa caucus results are in very close elections, (Remember the 2012 Republican caucus won initially by Romney and ultimately by Santorum.) it would make sense for Iowa to switch to a primary.</comment>

<comment>Heads Hillary, tails Bernie loses.  What is not fair about that?</comment>

<comment>6 times in a row? Really? haha</comment>

<comment>It is an old trick. If it's heads, Hilldogg wins, if it's tails, Bernie loses, so Hilldogg wins either way.</comment>

<comment>There are two separate videos of Sanders winning coin flips Here is one https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>BERNIE was berned then!!</comment>

<comment>Did you even read the article?</comment>

<comment>I am tired of being sick over this women. I am increasingly worried that I will begin punching people who support her. She has clearly committed treason and somehow people in IOWA are ok with it !  WTF is wrong with you people ?!</comment>

<comment>Insufficient evidence to support allegations of treason. Try to get out of your echo chamber.</comment>

<comment>The information given to us over the weekend not good enough for you ?  We are at war so treason works for me.  Bottom line is that I agree with Christie and Rubio on this.</comment>

<comment>I don't even know what you're talking about. Do you mean the email thing?</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>Okay. So it was revealed that several of the emails on her server, 22 IIRC, contained material which later became classified.And that constitutes treason how?Just to help you out, because I get the feeling you don't know what treason is, here's a quick definition:trea·sonˈtrēzən/nounthe crime of betraying one's country, especially by attempting to kill the sovereign or overthrow the government.</comment>

<comment>Pretty much sums up how I see this.  She has betrayed the country and in more ways than this one.  Is it textbook treason ? Maybe not.  Should she be running for President ?  NO.</comment>

<comment>Arnold, who sold secrets to the British is a traitor  Walker, who sold secrets to the Russians is a traitor. A lot of people argue that Pollard, who sold secrets to Israel is a traitor.Now I'm not sure if I'd put "mishandling classified information" in the bucket of treason.  Is it a mark of incompetence, yes. Malfeasance, not.Heck, if we're going to be classifying "mishandling" as treason then ... how would you classify all those people who were involved the program that sold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of advanced weapons and spare parts to the Iranian government?</comment>

<comment>Or guns to Mexico.   It's all the same to me and I will call them all out.  In secret, I hope the country actually implodes and we all have to live like frontier folk for 50 years.  Those who survive anyway.</comment>

<comment>Why?</comment>

<comment>Why not.  I could thrive in that situation so I guess it's just me being selfish.</comment>

<comment>I'm still not sure I get it.Right now there are a whole slew of places where you could live out your dream of being on the frontier. There are sparely populated rural areas in the lower 48 and then there's always Alaska.  So why care on whit about what or how the rest of us are doing? That's the beauty of the American project you don't need anyone's permission to make decisions such as that.</comment>

<comment>I feel as if humanity has hit evolutionary wall.   how do you fix it so "the project" can continue ?  Depopulation seems the best road.</comment>

<comment>20 of them to sensitive for public viewing.  That's bigger than just classified.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't call it treason, but I know if I had mishandled classified information like her office did when I was in the military, it would have ended my career. High level officials tend to get away with things the rank and file would suffer severely for. Double standards for the wealthy and powerful are what Sanders is attacking--which is why so many people like him.</comment>

<comment>Tell that to David Petraeus.</comment>

<comment>He was let off easy with a misdemeanor. He could have been charged with felonies, lost his pension, dishonorable discharge, etc.</comment>

<comment>the uranium deal engineered by the Clinton Foundation...it had to be approved by State Dept. Hillary claims that a lower level official took care of that...ahem....it was beneath her. and we have turnip dust in our eyes...but treason? HOW DARE YOU!  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04...</comment>

<comment>More information came out yesterday, and it's much worse than imagined.  For two reasons.  The obvious one is very bad; the non-obvious one is potentially catastrophic.INFO:  the TS e-mails contained real identities of overseas undercover CIA agents, and also the identities of foreign assets.  Note that the server was basically off-the-shelf; it had a public-facing login, so it was no more difficult to hack than a person's Disqus login (username/password).  In other words, 99.99% chance that Russia, China, etc. have the entire thing.Obvious problem - it's very bad for those specific agents and assetsNon-Obvious problem - Hillary deleted 30,000 e-mails, and the CIA doesn't know what was in them.  That means the Russians and Chinese have 30,000 e-mails that likely have TS information, but the CIA has no idea what it is.The best analogy is when you break a clear glass next to a swimming pool.  The problem isn't the broken glass; it's that you have to drain the whole damn swimming pool to make sure there's no glass in there.I don't know where the "treason" thing comes in.  Perhaps conflating the uranium deal with the server investigation, but we aren't at war with Russia, and Public Corruption =/= Treason.  </comment>

<comment>I like the analogy, and in general I agree the whole kerfuffle is bad for Clinton. My personal opinion is that she's almost pathologically cagey and probably covers her tracks when she walks from the living room to the kitchen. I don't think it speaks especially well for her character -- unless you like that sort of thing, which some people do. But it's still not treason or anything near it, it's some blend of incompetence, largely feigned, and careerist secrecy, which is bad but not deliberately-betraying-your-nation bad.</comment>

<comment>Please, man.  There are plenty of reasons to hate the vile Hillary without having to make stuff up.  It just makes you sound nutty.</comment>

<comment>Lol.  I can't take you seriously. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>Oh dear. Look up intellectual honesty. It's what you lack.</comment>

<comment>Walmart, China, Goldman Sachs, loyalty to Israel, Monsanto and Libya yielding ISIS.With patriots like these who needs treason?</comment>

<comment>"Had those six tosses gone differently, Sanders would have edged ahead by a couple tenths of a point, and it would have been his campaign declaring victory."This is FALSE! The tosses determined county delegates, of which there are thousands, NOT statewide delegates which were reported. Even if Hillary lost all 6 tosses, the difference would have been miniscule (much less than a tenth of a point statewide). She still would have won with a similar margin.Quote from the Des Moines register:"Similar situations played out at various precincts across the state, but had an extremely small effect on the overall outcome, in which Clinton won 49.9 percent of statewide delegate equivalents, while Sanders won 49.5 percent. The delegates that were decided by coin flips were delegates to the party's county conventions, of which there are thousands selected across the state from 1,681 separate precincts. They were not the statewide delegate equivalents that are reported in the final results."</comment>

<comment>He wasn't saying that it would've changed the delegate count, just that it would've changed the "SDE total," which is correct.  The total was:701 - Hillary697 - BernieWithout coin tosses:695 - Hillary696 - Bernie</comment>

<comment>There are 3 kinds of delegates. In order of lowest "value" to most value: County delegates, state delegates, and delegates to the national convention.The coin tosses determined the county delegates, NOT state delegates. The 5 extra county delegates would have given less than one extra state delegate (SDE). That being said, without the tosses, yes, the lead would have narrowed (even with the recently reported news of Sanders winning the last caucus to report) but Hillary would have eked out a little bit higher SDE.Of course, as you point out, the delegates to the national convention are also unchanged either way.</comment>

<comment>Clinton didn't win - she tied.  And given that she was supposed to win, and was leading by double digits as recently as Thanksgiving.</comment>

<comment>There are no ties in politics.  Bush VS Gore was a "virtual tie" and Gore won the popular vote yet Bush "won" the election.</comment>

<comment>It's hard to see Sanders doing well once the primaries move to states with minority populations, especially since the Democrats are so dependent on the Hispanic vote - many of them either fled from or have family in socialist sh!tholes, so they know socialism leads to the knock on the door at @2am and the secret police dragging you and your family to an unmarked cell, and food shortages and hoarding of toilet paper.Socialism only really appeals to lily-white progressives who haven't yet learned to think for themselves (why it appeals mostly to the young), what Lenin called useful idiots, who probably have never even read Marx and don't realize that socialism was simply meant to be a stage on the road to communism.</comment>

<comment>You don't really know what "socialism" or "communism" means, do you?  What's next, exhuming "Better dead than Red?"</comment>

<comment>So Bernie isn't being quite forthright when he identifies himself as a 'socialist'? His political differences from Clinton are largely a matter of branding.</comment>

<comment>No, shinynewtoken doesn't know what he's talking about when be conflates "socialism" with "communism."</comment>

<comment>And doesn't even bother to discuss "social democracy" or "democratic socialism", which are descriptors of what Sanders is about. Free markets with appropriate regulation, personal liberties, ending the militarized police state that we now have...</comment>

<comment>And that is different from the other candidates who are running as Democrats how?</comment>

<comment>It's the OPPOSITE of the establishment Democrats, so yeah.</comment>

<comment>Not Democrats, but "establishment Democrats". Do these other non establishment Democrats call themselves socialists?I thought the opposite of Democrat is Republican.</comment>

<comment>LOL You think "opposite" and "different" mean the same thing. That's adorable.</comment>

<comment>It's the opposite of what the establishment Dems want. Clear enough?</comment>

<comment>Why did Sanders run for the Senate as a socialist, but now want the nomination of the Democratic Party?</comment>

<comment>He didn't.  He ran as an independent.  Historically, he has caucused with Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Independent socialist. He must want to make a distinction by calling himself a socialist and not a Democrat. What is it?</comment>

<comment>He's to the Left of Clinton, who is more of a Wall Street centrist. The democratic socialist label is a great way to get out the word on how he is different. He's not much of a fan of big banks or big anything, really. He's a protectionist, in some ways like Rand Paul, and not a big fan of foreign adventures.Establishment Democrats, like Establishment Republicans, tie the fate of the average citizen to the health of the business community--that whole "job creator" nonsense. It's all trickle-down economics in the end and it doesn't work as advertised. Bernie eschews all the voodoo and supports a more bottom-up approach.Republicans differentiate their various sects through labels too, like "Tea Party" and "Family Values Conservative."</comment>

<comment>Love it or leave it!God is on our side!</comment>

<comment>You are going to really poop your pants when you learn that we have a socialist education system.  And despite all its failings, our public education system has served the United States remarkably well.The world is more complicated than labeling broad ideologies decisively good or bad.</comment>

<comment>Tell that to people who hate 'conservatives'.</comment>

<comment>Since you want to call the educational system socialist.   Why does socialism always fail, and why do the politicians always send their kids to private school?</comment>

<comment>You sir are correct.</comment>

<comment>The progressive mantra is always: Do as I say, not as I do.</comment>

<comment>The regressive/con mantra is always: I got mine. Screw you.</comment>

<comment>forgot the second Progressive mantra: You earned yours, now we are going to use the force of government to steal it from you and redistribute to the welfare leeches.  After all, you did not earn it.</comment>

<comment>Specifically, what socialist aspect always fails?  Finland has socialistic aspects and has one of the best education systems in the world. Do you think Social Security has been a net negative on the country?  Are senior citizens lives worse now because of it?  That's a socialist program...</comment>

<comment>Educate yourself. Don't allow yourself to live in a bubble. "I'm right, you're 100% wrong" is a sad way to live. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/....</comment>

<comment>Educate yourself a$$hole.  Socialism means the people own the means of production.Socialism is a political ideology and movement which has proposed a set of social and economic measures, policies and systems characterized by social ownership and democratic control of the means of production.</comment>

<comment>Jiffy Pop You are confusing socialism with communism. In communism, "the people" control the means of production.See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Look it up.</comment>

<comment>I did. I posted the relevant link.</comment>

<comment>I posted the reverent definition. Socialism always fails.</comment>

<comment>Just like it's been constantly "failing" across the Western European nations for decades now. Yet they still seem to best the USA in education, medical, and other quality of life metrics while being in a constant state of "failure." I'm sure those countries eventually fail due to "socialism" at some very distant point in the future, or not.</comment>

<comment>Again, they are capitalist societies.</comment>

<comment>With socialist controls on the capitalism. The world is rarely black and white. The US isn't a pure capitalistic society. If we were, we'd not have Social Security, Medicare, Welfare, and minimum wages nor would we have government-granted monopolies like municipal water departments. Financial and environment regulations, zoning, and all of the other democratically passed legislation that sets limits on capitalism is, at its roots, socialist in nature. We, and Western Europe, are not pure capitalist societies.</comment>

<comment>The US is capitalistic society.</comment>

<comment>::eye roll:: if you need things boiled down to the most basic and simple form, sure.But, it's about as true as saying "The US is a Christian nation." Which is to say, not really accurate enough to say much.</comment>

<comment>True or false. Is the US a capitalistic society?</comment>

<comment>Duh. Both "true" and "false."US is a blended society with both socialist and capitalist ideas in balance.</comment>

<comment>We are not socialist.  Look up the dam definition.</comment>

<comment>I already posted the link for you to read. Did you bother?</comment>

<comment>Your link is wrong.</comment>

<comment>OMG. Education is a great, great thing. Please read some basic definitions of the terms you're misusing. And you should really look up social democracy. ...Then make up your mind and contribute to discussions, meaningfully.</comment>

<comment>OMG.....you don't live in a socialist world.   Socialism always fails.</comment>

<comment>Please, please inform yourself. The world wide web was created for the purpose of making information easily accessible. Could you actually give a definition of the term socialism? Do you know how it differs from capitalism or plutocracy, social democracy and communism?Why does socialism always fail? Do you know of any historical examples of actual socialism?Or will you again answer with a dogmatic one-liner that only serves to painfully underscore your ignorance?Edit: Actually I do live in a social democracy with a regulated capitalist economy. The world is not black and white. Nor does it consist solely of the US.</comment>

<comment>We have an example of actual socialism failing as we type. Venezuela.  The perfect storm of progressive polices.</comment>

<comment>Interesting, although I do think that what Chavez did to Venezuela was more of a facade for authoritarianism, which runs counter to the basic ideas of socialist theory."The perfect storm of progressive polices."? lol, come on. Also, Bolivia under Evo Morales seems to be doing rather well...</comment>

<comment>Oh! It's in a book, is it? Then it must be TRUE! Why didn't I think of that? Political terms, especially in the past fifty years, have become extremely slippery as to meaning. Take the word "conservative" for instance. Many politicians, in the past 35 years especially, who call themselves conservatives do not have any desire to conserve the environment. They only want to conserve their hold on power (and their owner's wealth).</comment>

<comment>What do you call yourself?</comment>

<comment>Mysterioso ....</comment>

<comment>Yes, Social Security is almost bankrupt...it is a huge wealth redistribution system.  It reinforces the lack of personal responsibility in the low IQ progressive crowd.</comment>

<comment>So, social security payouts that the people receiving them PAID INTO is redistribution of wealth? lmao  Ummmm.... no.</comment>

<comment>the problem with welfare is people get way more from it than they paid in.  Hence why it is going broke.  The government should get out of the ponzi scheme called Social Security and let people manage their own finances.</comment>

<comment>Oh yeah?Explain people voting for all these ass clowns.</comment>

<comment>Here's the problem: increasingly, a lot of people (including plenty of Democrats) don't like our "socialist education system." I'm not one of them, but if you look at what many, many Dems (including Obama, Arne Duncan et al) have done to the public education system and how they constantly run it down, running on "hey, our public education system is already socialist" is not a winning argument for a general election.I haven't even gotten to the Republicans, whom I have noticed increasingly call traditional public schools, "government" schools. They have even more disdain for it.Again, I think our public education system is/was one of the great successes of the last 100 years, overall. But increasingly it is getting undermined by both sides of the aisle.</comment>

<comment>I've read Marx. You should too. Then you would begin to understand that Sanders is not preaching socialism or Marxism. But like Marx, he's looking out for people who work for a living.</comment>

<comment>Chelsea Clinton is the spittin' image of her grandmother, Bill's mom.Cruz' kids are cute, if that is your guiding force on whom to vote for. </comment>

<comment>In terms of perception, I think this may actually end up being a loss for Clinton... I have yet to hear any discussion about the optics of winning all 6 coin tosses in the media, but on Social Media, people have certainly taken notice. This definitely doesn't help dispel the view that Clinton is not trustworthy, and that the Democratic establishment is rallying to ensure her victory</comment>

<comment>Yeah okay.... I'm sure it's just luck.  Sanders needs to win bigger to get her out of the picture. I'm her luck has finally fun out. For how long can a criminal get lucky? She should not get the honor of being this country first female president. She doesn't deserve it.</comment>

<comment>Luck Hell!Ever hear about them coins with two heads or two tails and any magician worth their salt could have palmed it either way.See if the guy who flipped the coin has been on Penn and Teller's "Fool Me".</comment>

<comment>Lucky... right. Clinton is so corrupt I have little doubt she had the coin toss rigged with a two-headed coin. I still have a very hard time believing that there are people in this nation who seriously think it would be a good idea to hand this arrogant, greedy, corrupt, scheming politician the presidency.</comment>

<comment>With enemies like you, who needs friends?  That's got to be the stupidist load of paranoia I've ever heard.</comment>

<comment>If her last name was not Clinton, she would be in federal prison right now.</comment>

<comment>So you're claiming that the Clintons were prepared for the possibility of a tie vote, and brought two-headed coins to all the different precincts.I don't think any politician thinks that far ahead.</comment>

<comment>And if they do, perhaps we should elect them.</comment>

<comment>Oh I agree, that level of foresight and planning is a definite plus.</comment>

<comment>"Coin Toss" Clinton.Not exactly good press.</comment>

<comment>This Iowa reminds me of 2012 Iowa for the Republicans. It proved Santorum was viable, not that Romney was the loser. Likewise: Sanders is viable, Clinton isn't the loser. This won't be a blow-out.</comment>

<comment>Lady luck favors the Clintons. ;)</comment>

<comment>So does George Soros! </comment>

<comment>This is a blog post with a really silly premise. The vote was a tie. The only people to whom it matters that HC was declared winner are people who made bets on the outcome. The only political news out of it is that both sides had a ground game that did ok, and that HC is still drawing enough votes from her expected constituencies to win other primaries where the voters are more representative of Democrats and independents as a whole.</comment>

<comment>Valid point. Iowa is overwhelming white and evangelical. Let's see how well everyone does in other states.</comment>

<comment>If the workers for both candidates worked together for the nominee whoever that is, they would increase turnout and win the general election.</comment>

<comment>Bill or Bernie? Anyway there's always the dept of the Interior.</comment>

<comment>Bernie needs to find his area of strength. Foreign affairs isn't it. He can't be a vice president, the supreme court is out, so I am trying to think of what he does if he doesn't get the nomination. I doubt that he wants to go back to the Senate. President of Occupy Wall Street?</comment>

<comment>Lucky would have been winning the state handily.  I expect she'll still win the nomination, but Bernie looks poised to make this a long race.</comment>

<comment>Sanders' demographics do not match those of winning Democratic candidates.</comment>

<comment>They do more so than Clinton's.  Her complete and utter failure to attract young voters, including young women who are supposedly her natural demo, is a death knell in the general election.  In the past 35 years, we've had two Democrats who won presidential elections.  Both did so by mobilizing a significantly high turnout from young people.  If you can't do that as a Democrat, you can't win.</comment>

<comment>Tie votes are often settled with a coin toss after a recount in the US. Small groups can more easily produce tie votes. Caucus votes are small groups. Voters had a chance to move to one or another candidate during the vote.http://2016iowacaucus.com/how-...</comment>

<comment>I understand the rules m w, I am not questioning that they exist for a reason - I am saying that the way they decide a split vote is sort of hilarious.</comment>

<comment>OK, but it seems ok to me, especially since people could realign an not waste their vote on a non viable candidate. There is no reason that a majority is taken to be the will of a body of people, except historical (Locke). As you know sometimes rules require more than a majority but that would not make much sense in this instance because ultimately another vote on a different day with an about 50% split might go either way anyway.</comment>

<comment>Is it true that there were 6 coin tosses, and Hillary won all of them?</comment>

<comment>Can we have an instant replay?(It doesn't matter. Each will get about the same share of delegates anyway. If one or two more people came out the outcome would have changed slightly and no coin tosses.)Option Two: Cruz had it rigged to divide the Democrats with conspiracy theories.Option Three: Putin did it for the sake of option Two because he likes Trump.</comment>

<comment>Nah, most smart people in the world and even in the US know our "democracy" is a sham.</comment>

<comment>Do you realise that in the original democracies of Greece, the people who filled government posts were selected by lot from all citizens.</comment>

<comment>The citizens actually got to vote on issues.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Not true. There were many educated people among the citizens. It is true that the gods were thought to influence events, but the greatest weigh was put on the ability of people to use their judgement and reasoning to decide things.They invented logic, geometry and rhetoric. Many logical fallacies they identified as such are used to deceive people today in politics, and are not recognized as such.In terms they invented, for example, the US was designed as a 'polity' but has become an 'oligarchy'.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps I was too brief. I don't lionize Athens. I did not suggest choosing officials by lot was a good idea. I raised the matter to suggest that a random choice has the value of being impartial. People generally have no conception of democracy--and none of ideal democracy-- except that gained from the usual practice of politics they experience together with the commonly used expression "American democracy".</comment>

<comment>Grammar is not your strong suit. Your comment has an unclear reference in its use of "It's" which in your comment refers to the subject of the preceding sentence--"Athenian democracy".You wanted the reference to be to the subject of the first sentence--"people". And "people" is also has an unclear referent in that it might refer to people making comments or people generally.Don't blame others for your own deficiencies.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That isn't how the English language works, sorry. If you have a pronoun with a reference to a subject previously stated, then it refers to the immediately preceding subject. That is the benefit of grammar, it disambiguates reference in a predictable way when its rules are followed.This might help.http://partofspeech.org/what-p...Andhttps://webapps.towson.edu/ows...</comment>

<comment>Just read the grammar site I mentioned or find another under the topic "unclear reference" of pronoun 'it',(The word 'rhetoric' doesn't mean what you think it means.)</comment>

<comment>You didn't construct any rhetoric. You simply used "it's" with a vague referent.  And you used "people" in a similarly a vague way. Now reflect on the difference between "grammar" and "rhetoric" or "substantially" and "substantively". Go over that. (The link works now.)</comment>

<comment>I would term it as a representative democracy fronting for a plutocracy. I think this could be understood as a type of oligarchy, but because it identifies wealth as perhaps the key component, I prefer plutocracy.</comment>

<comment>OK, I'll bite. What would non-sham democracy look like? Rulers would not be chosen by lot from citizens, and laws would not be decided on the basis of a majority vote by the citizens assembled for the purpose. Instead...what?</comment>

<comment>I see, another monarchist, but that isn't what I asked. What form would democracy take with citizens of the best kind.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I see, the best society would not need a government because it would be entirely voluntary. "Cheating", I presume breaking promises, would have to be excluded rather than punished.So all promises would have to be immediately carried out (as described by Hobbes) which of course would make cooperation that extends through time impossible.Yes I have seen proposals along that line from Kropotkin and in Marx as his version of the post scarcity stateless society.I say monarchist, because if there were  perfect rulers then there would not be any effect from a defective human nature as long as they were excluded from rule.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Monarchists believe that since no perfect people exist, and since people need government, then the best rule would be by the best person --either chosen by god, or wisest, or holiest. On Hobbes, he assumed that people would not keep promises without fear of punishment in a hypothetical state of nature without government. LeviathanOn Kropotkin, he was quite influential and many organizations were formed to live according to his conceptions of social anarchy, as given for example in Mutual Aid.see:http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/ANA...You ideas are similar in many ways to Kropotkin's. Just not as well thought out.</comment>

<comment>Your reading skills reflect the state of our education system.First of all, Athenian democracy was pretty much direct. No scholar of ancient Athens really deny that and you haven't provided any evidence to counter it.Second, I didn't say nor imply that Athenian democracy wasn't a sham. I said our democracy was a sham. Someone else brought up classical Athens.Third I did not "lionize" Athenian democracy.You thought that I implied the lionization of Athenian democracy because you lack basic reading skills. Much like most Americans. Athens actually lacked some of the things a healthy democracy ought to have (for example only 15% of the population could vote, and most of those voters were hopelessly poorly educated). But at least they could vote directly on the issues which was my point.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>"Have you read Aristotles Politics?"Yes, actually I have. He has several different political systems which he advocated and the Athenian one wasn't one of them. But he never denied that they could vote directly on the issues. His issue is with the ignorant masses (demos) and the corruption which are separate issues."What I'm telling you is that Athenian democracy always was a sham."That very well might be but like I said, you mistakingly thought I denied it when I did not. And neither did I "imply" it. You thought I did because your poor reading skills led you to a false implication.</comment>

<comment>In the Greek democracies, citizens voted on laws, but officials for domestic affairs (not the military) were filled by lot. People could only serve once though.</comment>

<comment>We ought to try that.I suspect a couple hundred random citizens could function better than Congress and be more "of the people, by the people.... yadda yadda."</comment>

<comment>The founders thought that voting would be better. The remnant of it the US is in jury selection.</comment>

<comment>Remnant of random selection among citizens, right?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yes thanks for the expanded account. There were many democracies some less complex. The use of selection by lot was said to epitomise the democratic form because it was a means of giving each citizen an equal chance of ruling and being ruled in turn. More complex forms--mixtures- give other factors a part in rule and make it less equal. I prefer 'polity' which resembles the form the founders tried to create.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You mean in practise in Athens, which was not a pure democracy as you note.In principle it is true that a random selection from a population gives the best sample of the characteristics and is most representative of it.That principle runs through all modern scientific research.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Fine. I agree. However do you agree that citizens deserve equal rights and equality before the law? As for government, do you believe that government should take each citizen as deserving equal concern and respect?The argument for representative government as the best form rests on the premise that if rulers and ruled are equally affected by laws and have to anticipate that they may change places, then it will be in their individual interests to rule in the public interest.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>There was a version of the argument given by Aristotle in his defence of 'polity' in that each part of the society is present in the institutions of government playing a part suited to their different natures and all alike are subject to laws applied equally to all.For the argument against the "most men are bad" again see Aristotle. You haven't actually said anything until you give an account of 'bad' -- what it is, why it effects are, and how it comes to be. If you mean 'selfish', that is addressed in the Republic as given by Glaucon and is answered by Socrates.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I am not, perhaps you are unfamiliar with the texts I mention.And, there is a difference between the meaning if of the words "substantially" and "substantively" You wrote the former but probably meant the latter. If you look them up you will see that and not repeat your mistake.)(You say all men are bad, but don't say what you mean by that. You need to explain what you mean and why that rules out democracy.)</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You said that there is no "good system for people ruling people". I guess you mean perfectly good. That does not follow from the premise you propose as true: that people are 'bad' in that they have "flawed perceptions of self interest". "hatred" and so forth. None of these leads to the conclusion that is no system of government that is good unless you silently add the word "perfectly" to the sentence. You say you are (sigh) familiar with the texts I mention, yet you seem to have missed the fact that all of them recognise that people are not perfectly good, yet each of them, different ways, concludes that there are governments that are good.You didn't invent the idea of social anarchism as a candidate to replace government. You might want to read Kropotkin to see it argued.</comment>

<comment>The obvious question then, is does this result in an optimally efficient and reasonably equitable stable government?</comment>

<comment>Would Charles Manson, had he lived in this period and a been resident of that polity, be perhaps chosen by lot?</comment>

<comment>Thank you TA, for providing yet another reason why Iowa should not be first in the primaries. Yeesh.</comment>

<comment>Every system has to have a tie-breaker. One is nearly as good as any other. I would have accepted "pistols at dawn" or "jello wrestling" as well.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't that let her off the hook?</comment>

<comment>still more democratic than a court decision.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't say democratic, but more equitable, yes.</comment>

<comment>equitable, yes i would say that is a better word.</comment>

<comment>I don't get the indignation here. It's a tie, on several minor delegates, who all totaled up equal less than a single state delegate. It's not the "fate of the country" or even the "county" nor is it unreasonable to use a game of chance to settle a tie with such low stakes as those.</comment>

<comment>Well which is it? Is it a tie or does Hillary officially get the win from a coin toss?Do the results of the caucuses determine the candidate? Do the candidates have the potential to be our next president? Will our next president play a role in shaping the fate of our country?</comment>

<comment>This is a "butterfly's beating wings" situation. Bernie can still go on to beat her in 49 more states.In the end, she performed worse than anticipated and Bernie came up with gold stars. That's the real news here.</comment>

<comment>So what they're saying is, she didn't win an election, she won a couple coin tosses.</comment>

<comment>In essence, yes.</comment>

<comment>She tied the election. She won the coin tosses.</comment>

<comment>False. Sanders won 2 or 3 more "delegate equivalents" when you remove the coin tosses. Still essentially a tie, but in the media, that would count as a win for Clinton, since apparently winning coin tosses count as a win for Clinton, so... Let's call it like it is.</comment>

<comment>Where "they" is the group of people dedicated to radically misinterpreting events, sure.</comment>

<comment>We still got a looooooonnnnnnnnng way to go until election day and I'm already over it. Seriously, elections in this country last way too long.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand how Hillary supporters can be so cocky. She is a terrible candidate. Despite enjoying incumbent levels of support from the Democratic Party, and starting up 30 percent over Bernie Sanders, she ended up winning six precincts by only a coin toss. Clinton seems to have a stronger base of support among Iowa coins than she does among Iowa caucus voters.</comment>

<comment>Well, yes. Money loves her more than people do.</comment>

<comment>Bernie won his first election by only 10 votes. It happens.</comment>

<comment>Too bad Al and George didn't settle 2000 this way; it wouldn't have changed anything, either guy was a trainwreck looking to happen.</comment>

<comment>Everyone knows coins are part of the establishment. Of course they're going to favor Clinton over Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Six coin tosses in a row? She must have duped Bernie with the old, "heads I win, tails you lose" gambit.</comment>

<comment>Did his representatives say "Yeah, whatever."?</comment>

<comment>Yup. And they also wanted 90% of the value of the coin.</comment>

<comment>I'd say a tie is a de facto victory for Sanders, considering where things stood only a few months ago.</comment>

<comment>I would love to agree, but Nate Silver makes a compelling argument that Sanders needed a clear win in Iowa. He's got New Hampshire locked but South Carolina looks pretty hopeless and Super Tuesday is going to be very rough. A Sanders win would've been much bigger headlines; as it is he's just managing to stay in the fight.</comment>

<comment>Or it could galvanize support for him and put him over the top, since now everyone can see that he really is a contender with a genuine shot at winning.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Sanders manifested himself as a real contender</comment>

<comment>COINGHAZI!!!1!1!!!!!!1!</comment>

<comment>Revenge for Bush - Gore.</comment>

<comment>If it was so close that you'd flip a coin six times, what not just give each half and only flip a coin for the last vote if there was an odd number?</comment>

<comment>They made up rules and these are them. Next time maybe they will do it your way.</comment>

<comment>Hillary "wins" the Iowa caucus election with SIX coin tosses in a row in her favor? I call shenanigans. There is only a 1.56% (1 in 64) chance of that happening. Flip a coin yourself and see how many times you'll get heads or tails six frigging times in a row.Top-heavy coins can easily be obtained when your main political donors have combined assets in the trillion-dollar range.</comment>

<comment>Trump's casino pals did the coin tosses  fix to sow discord in Democratic ranks.</comment>

<comment>There is a 1 in 64 chance of ANY result, including an exact split. Its not enough tosses to even out.</comment>

<comment>It was not that close, remember the popular vote does not count in Democratic primaries.There were 44 delegates at stake last night, Hillary already locked the additional 8 Iowa super-delegates. Hillary would have been the 'winner' even if she only gathered 19 of the 44 delegates picked by voters (19 + 8 = 27 of 52 Iowa's delegates.Supporting Bernie is like rooting for the Washington Generals vs. the Globe Trotters.  You can't beat the house and the Clintons own the DNC.</comment>

<comment>"Supporting Bernie is like rooting for the Washington Generals vs. the Globe Trotters."So, you're saying that the primaries are fixed, and should only be viewed as entertainment and not a real competition?</comment>

<comment>Yes, the party has built in a Hillary advantage, before any voting started she had about 350 of the needed 2,382.She can loose most states but if she keeps it close, she will win the nomination.</comment>

<comment>Correct, Bernie needs to beat Hillary by about 15% in order to pick up more delegates than she does.If Hillary flames out it will not be because of Bernie.</comment>

<comment>Its over Hillary...but think how great you are going to look in prison stripes.</comment>

<comment>If Ms Clinton doesn't sit 'Bill' down at home to watch soaps, she's going to curry even more difficulty.  He is not and candidate, nor do democrats want him as one.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Many do.</comment>

<comment>I would say not, if they were truly faced with the fact of him running.</comment>

<comment>He is quite popular. I don't think we mind having him around the white house so long as the interns are well monitored.</comment>

<comment>The 60 missing  people needs to be found. The coin flips... I have My doubts as AT LEAST ONE Caucus Captain is a CLINTON STAFFER and the DEMS of IOWA knew it! So how many others have "Pledged allegiance to the flag of the Hillary States of America"?</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz has people chained together in his basement.</comment>

<comment>An HONEST Dem Party would release the ACTUAL TALLIES. Bernie wins massively in the Metro areas, coin flips out in the Grange Hall caucus places and Hillary was already GUARANTEED the 'superdelegates'. I am not saying it was DIRTY, but it would be LESS SCUMMY if there was a HINT OF TRANSPARENCY in Iowa by the PARTY OF CLINTON.</comment>
