<comment>Goes to show the political bloodsuckers respect no party</comment>

<comment>Wish it was so easy. The DNC has other plans and to hell with actual voters. Note how Hillary has all the superdelegates in her corner thanks to the financial support of Wall street so even if Sanders wins, he loses. And even if Hillary was to drop out the DNC would stick Biden in and take it away from Sanders. The best that can be hoped for is they MIGHT ask him to be vice president.</comment>

<comment>VP would be an acceptable compromise. It would be extremely difficult for Bernie to implement most of his platform as POTUS as the house stands. In fact, he may cause even more gridlock and stonewalling from the right as they throw more toys from the pram. As VP he would be able to keep the conversation going and exert some influence while still being in a prominent role.</comment>

<comment>That goes for you too. Bernie for VP? Not going to happen.</comment>

<comment>"The best that can be hoped for is they MIGHT ask him to be vice president." That is the stupidest thing I have read all day, and that is saying a lot. Anyone who would suggest that has no understanding of Sanders' strong principles. And Biden hasn't a chance either. He never did.</comment>

<comment>This is a mindless reflex from someone who doesn't accept that Sanders could win.Sanders has even less use for Clinton than Clinton has for Sanders. They have as much in common with each other as they have with Donald Trump.Actually, that's an unfair statement. When Trump snapped his fingers and commanded Hillary to show up at his wedding, Clinton said:"Where, when, and what color pantsuit you you want me to wear?"As Trump has bragged, he gives out bribes to ALL politicians of all stripes to hedge his bets, and it ALWAYS pays off. Any time he wants anything, he get its it, having paid in advance.</comment>

<comment>You underestimate the power of the DNC leadership. All women BTW. They will not accept anyone BUT Hillary. They allowed Obama thru because he was black but NO WAY will they allow another white male.Now shut up and be a good little democrat and do what the DNC says.</comment>

<comment>But, Hillary will be indicted in March.  Hardly auspicious timing for her "run", no?</comment>

<comment>A socialist, anti-globalist, anti-capitalist, anti-trade, pacifist is to be the next leader of the sole hyperpower on the planet and protector of the free world? Not likely.</comment>

<comment>Ignoring the rest of your comment for a moment, what's wrong with pacifism?</comment>

<comment>Is this a serious comment?  You realize the US of A wouldn't exist of the colonists were all pacifists, right?  And that all manners of tyranny would easily supplant any form of democracy.</comment>

<comment>The problem with this argument (as I see it) is that it assumes that everything in history would have turned out the same, just that some people would not have thought back.Like, I don't know, let's go with Hitler. Hitler should of been stood up to, of course. Nobody doubts that. But the thing is, if people had been more pacifist before him, there might not have been a WW1, or perhaps not the terrible Versailles Treaty that led to WW2.You understand where I'm coming from, right? Besides that, pacifism doesn't mean rolling over and letting people oppress you (see Gandhi for example, or MLK).What's wrong with a leader whose first instinct isn't to sabre rattle?</comment>

<comment>A few German generals did, in fact, "stand up to" Hitler, not that it did them any good.  Heinz Guderian comes to mind, for one.  Funny thing is, the standard Hitler response to second-guessing or disagreement was invariably a Hillary-esque ("What DIFFERENCE does it make ? ) tirade.  Hillary reminds me of Magda Goebels, wife of the Nazi propaganda minister who murdered her own kids.</comment>

<comment>"Hillary reminds me of Magda Goebels, wife of the Nazi propaganda minister who murdered her own kids."___You remind me of Hillary Clinton.</comment>

<comment>It's not that the Founders were pacifists. The point is they were, wisely, opposed to what they called "foreign entanglements." Or what today we'd call "quagmires," "Iraq," or "Afghanistan." Go read some of Geo. Washington's thoughts on being a global power.</comment>

<comment>I have.  But the US of Washington's time was markedly different than the US of the 20th century.  It was a new and relatively unstable republic.  It was largely agrarian and had a small economy relative to European powers.  It was very pragmatic for a new, weak nation to avoid foreign entanglements.</comment>

<comment>We're a country that has been at war 93% of the time since we began, what need do we have for a pacifist president?</comment>

<comment>Considering how many of those wars were started by American aggression (See: 1812, everything done in Central and South America, the Philippines, Vietnam) I'd say it couldn't hurt.</comment>

<comment>I was trying to sound ironic -- I'm upset about living in a perpetual war machine society</comment>

<comment>Try living in perpetual war!</comment>

<comment>Not sure if you know this or not but the "protector of the free world" has more people in prison than any other nation.  Now I know lots of people are pretty stupid but I can't imagine how stupid you have to be in order to believe that the country with the most people in prison in history is the "free world."</comment>

<comment>He's not a pacifist. He says so repeatedly. He voted for Afghanistan and Kosovo.</comment>

<comment>He was a Stalinist even after Stalin's crimes against humanity were documented. He was a frequent visitor to the USSR, visited Cuba and Nicaragua, where he went to celebrate the rise to power of the Marxist-Leninist Sandinista government. He honeymooned in the USSR and had a USSR flag in his office for years.</comment>

<comment>Red-baiting.  Classy.</comment>

<comment>Since you mentioned Nicaragua, you believe the Reagan administration did the right thing by arming and funding the Contras with money that stemmed directly from the crack/cocaine explosion in the US? I don't think so. </comment>

<comment>The Reagan disciples conveniently forget about those nuns who were murdered by the Contras.</comment>

<comment>Nevermind selling Iran weapons that had been prohibited, then using the funds to further prop up a regime whose time was long overdue. Anyone care to guess how many times the USA intervened in Nicaragua up until the late 80s? And the Somozas were generally the beneficiaries, by the way.</comment>

<comment>Guess who else were Stalinists? The Allies. I hear Churchill and Roosevelt met with him quite often, and even...collaborated with him.Anyway, Sanders isnt a Stalinist.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is a Bolshevik.</comment>

<comment>"He was a Stalinist."Obviously a Bernie supporter in disguise.  :)</comment>

<comment>The great thing about being a Bernie supporter is that we don't have to disguise ourselves, unlike the ignorant Cons who must tell complete fabrications to justify their scumbag positions.  And Hills ain't much better.</comment>

<comment>You'd like a list of the Democratically elected governments the US overthrew and installed right wing dictatorships in their place?Lumumba, Allende, Mossadegh? Any of these names sound familiar to you?Didn't think so.</comment>

<comment>Great article. God his foreign policy would be a breath of fresh for anyone who has lived and worked abroad and understands our overwhelming influence on the rest of the world.</comment>

<comment>We can see right now what kinds of half-truths and lies Breitbart,com is starting to gin up. Thanks, dull old coin</comment>

<comment>Post some examples.</comment>

<comment>HA ha ha, the guy above me already has. I researched it and saw it was stuff from Breitbart.com. Hence, I called him on it. I am done with you trolls.</comment>

<comment>Post some examples.</comment>

<comment>"Post some examples." Oh, now I'm saying it!</comment>

<comment>"Post some examples." You sound like a broken record. You have google. Do your own research.</comment>

<comment>You people can't back up what you say.</comment>

<comment>It sure is nice and refreshing to read a post about Bernie that is factual, not a hit-piece and that demonstrates just how straight his head is on.</comment>

<comment>You mean a puff-piece?</comment>

<comment>What is there to criticise? That he challenged reagans policies in the iran-contra scandal? Pretty sure he was on the right side of history. Is he perfect? No, but he deeply gives a damn and has empathy for others... A rare thing these days in this country</comment>

<comment>Wait, I though foreign policy capability was judged by how many bombing targets you can identify, how many tanks, ships and aircraft you propose to build and how many sanctions you can implement.  Are you suggesting there's another approach?</comment>

<comment>He seems like an honest and sincere man, and much of how he views the world and US foreign policy sounds good on paper.But then you read how he thought the South African transition towards a true democracy could be a beacon of hope for the world and you realize that, as a socialist, Bernie is and always will be naive.For those who haven't followed, South Africa has become a hellhole that is far worse off today than it was 20 years ago, not because apartheid was good, but rather because blind belief in democracy (and democratic socialism) is in denial of the lessons of history. The will of the people must be strictly checked by Constitutional balances and democratic decision-making must be limited to election of representatives who themselves must be strictly limited in what they are allowed to do.Sadly, Sanders represents a strain of thinking in America and the world that is based on ignorance of history and economics. The American founders knew that democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for dinner, and that the passions of the mob must be held in check by extreme limits on what the government is allowed to do. Sanders wants to effectively extend democratic decision-making to huge new sectors of the economy that should go organized by free actors who make decisions via the pricing mechanism, (they vote with their wallet). If we were to implement his ideas for America, it would be a disaster.</comment>

<comment>While I agree with some of your comment, namely that democracy is a check on the powers of both govt and the people to achieve a workable balance, "the passions of the mob must be held in check by extreme limits on what the government is allowed to do."I strongly disagree with this section:"Sanders wants to effectively extend democratic decision-making to huge new sectors of the economy that should go organized by free actors who make decisions via the pricing mechanism, (they vote with their wallet). If we were to implement his ideas for America, it would be a disaster."Democratic socialism is not totalitarian communism where all power sits in the hands of the govt. It is also NOT control of the "means of production" such as corporations. It would be the implementation of equitable taxes on corporations and individuals, in order to pay for societal good such as universal healthcare, education and infrastructure, all of which would be a benefit and impetus to economic growth. The checks and balances of the American democracy would not only be in place, they would be strengthened by being brought back into balance. In short, what Sanders proposes is trying to reach the ideals of the American Experiment by creating a society where opportunity exists for all the citizens.As to foreign policy, Sanders does not advocate a roll over and play dead isolationist stance, but rather a stand back and work with allies through diplomacy to achieve goals rather than using the blunt force of military intervention, which has not worked very well for us.Sanders does not have all the answers - no one does - but I feel he is pointing in the right direction to return America to a democratic balance.</comment>

<comment>The Sanders govt essentially will have control of production and policy of private companies via specific federal policy, in the name of social equality. His biggest selling point is providing 'free' goods and services to the electorate by taxing the rich and teh corporation like an endless golden goose.A strong economy is not based on high taxes on the top 10% of people who pay 90% of all income taxes. Nor is it based on cheap economic populism. Sanders has never ran a business, doesnt understand basic economics and is more naive than Obama when it comes to foreign policy.</comment>

<comment>What are you, 5?</comment>

<comment>It both cracks cracks me up and deeply saddens me when I see ignorant morons try to pretend that their regurgitation of Con talking points and trickle down economics is some kind of intellectual argument.  You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about, NONE!  And Sanders supporters, in general,  are far more informed and are not dumb enough to entertain your ignorance.  If you have the desire to pretend as if you have some intellectual ability go spew your ignorant tropes at one of the Con sites 'cause those people are morons and will believe anything!!</comment>

<comment>Either you don't know what the rate of taxation was in the years after WWII, or you think we don't. And foreign policy is usually a version of domestic, which should engender feelings of dread in you, since what is practiced overseas has, indeed, come home to roost. Seen any police departments, lately? Are you old enough to remember when they weren't outfitted with gear one would previously only have found on a battlefield?</comment>

<comment>Because US initiated regime change has worked SO WELL all over the world for a century.</comment>

<comment>You mean naive like George Bush, who thought Iraqis would greet us as liberators?South Africa did not become a hellhole because the will of the people was not checked sufficiently through Constitutional balances. Limiting representatives on paper does not lead to the Hand of God appearing and forcing those representatives to respect their limitations. South Africa is a hellhole because it had zero traditions of democracy. Democracy is something that must evolve. It cannot simply replace autocracy overnight.We overlook that we, the US, inherited at our founding centuries of democratic traditions. By the times of George III, the monarch was no longer an absolute ruler and had not been for more than 500 years. Democracy means to give up the idea that "might makes right" in your politics. It would be unthinkable for an American politician, upon losing an election, to say, "Oh, hell no!" and shoot his opponent dead. But that's politics-as-usual in many other countries. That's why they're hellholes even when they have elaborate constitutions closely modeled after the American one.</comment>

<comment>McGovern was my first vote, Nixon took it in landslide, Carter was first "win" and Reagan pulled his op with North to get prestige and won election; Clinton slipped in and slick out greased the cons with welfare reform and trade deals, but the country made money, ignoring the real cost, we faltered badly, Gore just caved, and they, the "cons" drove into ditch, taking the west along on the slide, Obama pulls it off! We had such hopes, the world ponies up prize to enhance his status and maybe invest in peace? nah, we have been robbed since murder of Kennedy's and the doublespeak has reached a sophisticated level not even Orwell/ Huxley could have imagined, I am sad for my country, we have generations of us who sacrificed and bled, the price is still being drawn, taken, pension in ashes, SSI anemic and medicare medicaid is illusionary... Bernie? por que no? why not, Warren would have been my choice, Biden may be drafted, the problem is faith...so eroded from any side, but as grandfather still hope for America the cons have soiled themselves in greed, avarice, and power, and yet know somehow we can bridge and be better for it, lucky, we are lucky.Thanks to all those in uniform serving to keep us safe, Bless you.</comment>

<comment>Like him even more after reading this.  But I still doubt he can win, leaving us with a far worse cast.</comment>

<comment>Democracy is about the power of your own vote, not about your duty to rubber stamp the wishes of the establishment.</comment>

<comment>Paid-for vacations are the best.It's patently absurd for a mayor to visit another country and criticize US foreign policy. I don't care which way the mayor leans or what the particular policy is.  Your job is to govern for your citizens.  The day-to-day concerns of a city in New Hampshire have zip to do with the Contras and the Sandanistas.BTW, I've been to Denmark, and it's lovely.  I have friends there.  But Bernie's conception of Denmark and the reality are very different.  CNN had a recent article that summed this up very well.</comment>

<comment>Bernie travels a lot, he must be wise and capable!</comment>

<comment>The Clinton team keeps reminding us about the millions of miles she traveled as SoS. So, what's your point?</comment>

<comment>my statement was sarcastic.</comment>

<comment>The article clearly states, as I'm sure you're aware, that he also went on trips that he paid for himself. They weren't all joyrides on the government's dime. Stop cherry picking.</comment>

<comment>We must have different definitions of "clearly."  The article states his travels were government and privately funded.  That does not mean Bernie paid for them himself.  The Teamsters trip was privately funded.  Bernie didn't pay for it.  In fact it's normal for politicians to take privately funded junkets, usually paid for by lobbyists like the Teamsters.  Again, paid-for vacations are nice.  If Bernie paid out of his own pocket for any of those trips, the article could have "clearly" stated "Bernie paid for  trip to X himself."</comment>

<comment>Is this truly your gripe? That he went on vacations to other countries as mayor?If this is the best you've got then Bernie is the best presidential candidate we've ever had.</comment>

<comment>It shows Bernie isn't above dipping into government coffers to benefit himself rather than his constituents.  Then again, a socialist like Bernie thinks the the government should pay for a lot of things, so even though I think it's a criticism, he probably thinks it's staying true to his principles.</comment>

<comment>What it shows is your narrow view of government is ridiculous and that some people recognize the value of seeing first hand what other countries are going through. Keep in mind the places he visited were important countries to U.S. Foreign Policy at the time he was visiting.And seriously, you might try not being scared of a label you don't understand if you want to be seen as more credible.</comment>

<comment>My narrow view of government?  Actually, it's the Founder's view of government as well.  What Bernie is proposing is a fundamental departure from limited government.  It is indeed a revolution.  Opposing that revolution and choosing to maintain the original regime isn't "narrow."  It's actually American.I'm not "scared" of socialism.  I have a very good understanding of it.  I just think it's a bad idea.  It's only successful in small, homogeneous countries, and even those countries have recently rolled back benefits.  In other countries it's been ruinous (e.g., Greece, Venezuela). Capitalism needs curbs, but socialism is several steps too far.</comment>

<comment>Ahh, the morons!!  The "founders" view?  Really?  Where dop you idiots come from??  A sad commentary of the American education system and society in general that we have a country that creates so many people as ignorant as you.  Why don't you tell us how many times the "founders" mentioned capitalism in the Constitution?  Plus help us remember the parts where the economic system of the U.S. was described in such vivid detail that even an imbecile like yourself knows their intentions almost 300 years later?</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the kind words.If you want socialism, great.  But considering the US has been a capitalist country since its founding, it doesn't take much effort to conclude that the Founders wanted to leave that system in place.  They could have created a government that heavily taxed it citizens in return for a welfare state guaranteeing shelter and food, the two biggest concerns of that era, but they didn't.  So what economic system do you think they intended to function in their new nation?  Only a mouth-breathing troglodyte would reject all history, logic, and common sense, and arrive at the conclusion that socialism is what the Founders intended or even allowed for.  They could have implemented it.  They didn't.  That's some pretty hard evidence, maestro.Oh, and please bring up slavery as a rebuttal. Yes, they intended slavery to be an aspect of the economic system.  You know what happened when the government wanted to abandon slavery?  A revolution.  So yes, abandoning capitalism for socialism would be a revolution.  Even St. Bernie himself calls it that.  Maybe not a guns and ammunition revolution, but a revolution nonetheless.</comment>

<comment>As proven over and over again, there is no point in arguing with moron Cons, they're just too frigging stupid.  Too stupid and just filled with conservative mythology for idiots. Slavery? Who said anything about slavery? But you being a moron and  so filled with the Con non sense that you THINK is factual, you can't wait to repeat that "slavery was about economics and the civil war wasn't about slavery but economics and maybe throw in some of the "Africans sold slaves too." You're too dumb to recognize your own stupidity and won't recognize that we already know your stupid Conserva troll re-interpretation of everything including history. But what you don't get and will never get is that it's only you ignorant Con morons who are too dumb to know that it's made up crap designed to keep you stupid, angry, & in fear of something, anything, all in an ongoing scam to separate the fool from.his money. But hey keep on keeping on, being stupid</comment>

<comment>Jesus, you're an angry dude.  And you're a liberal?  Or one of those ironic misanthropic liberals?  The kind that hates everyone and wants to see the rich burn because of your own feeling of inadequacy and that the system is rigged against you despite your associates degree?  Do you have friends?  Does anyone like you?  You seem far too angry to form any positive relationship. Maybe step away from the keyboard and put a dip in you mouth.  Most people from Alabama find that satisfying.BTW, the Civil War was absolutely about slavery.  In fact my comment pretty much depended on that.  But like I said above, reading comprehension isn't very strong for Alabama educated folks.  Roll Tide!</comment>

<comment>Staunch progressive and Bernie supporter here...perhaps you mean well but you will convince no one by arguing with insults no matter how righteous the cause, and may be turning open minds away in the process.If you're trolling well done I guess.</comment>

<comment>Hey Vince!! I'm thrilled to hear you are Feeling the Bern!! And I understand where you're coming from. We've taught for much of our lives that reason and logic are our guides and logical arguments will persuade. I myself subscribe to that belief. But it only works when dealing with human beings who are also capable of reason and logic. The Cons are neither. No amount of reason or logic will persuade this group who have chosen ignorance as their rallying cry! And believe me, I didn't arrive at this conclusion overnight. I actually live in Alabama and I've watched people I've known my whole life including my family go from reasonable rational people to complete nonsense. It's like they're in a cult and you know when a person is in a cult logic does no good because a cult always teaches that any other viewpoint is false prophecy, just as the Con entertainment complex does. So the Con ideology is not just a viewpoint that you can reason with, it's a sickness that needs to be shamed and ridiculed for the evil that it is. So, truly, with all respect, I understand your position but I definitely see it quite differently.</comment>

<comment>I can pretty much guess that you're one of those morons that thinks the USA and it's "founding fathers" created capitalism. That belief is a true proof of how ignorant Cons are.</comment>

<comment>And I can pretty much assure from your comment that you have a problem with reading comprehension.  Capitalism was already in place with the Constitution was drafted.  The Founders didn't invent it, just kept it.  Everyone knows Adam Smith invented capitalism.</comment>

<comment>Eh... "Wealth of Nations" was published in 1776, the same year the American Revolution started. Capitalism didn't really start until the Industrial Revolution.The essence of capitalism is the harnessing of paid labor for profit. Slavery-based farming was not capitalism unless you want to claim Ancient Greece, which was a slavery-based farming society, was also a capitalist society. Capitalism thus began with the Age of Factories.</comment>

<comment>And Jebus helped write the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>I know, right! It's right there in genesis, where God creates Uhmerica and then commands his chosen people, Uhmericans to go out get as many guns and weapons as possible and to hell with the poor, I got mine. God said, "if I liked those poor fuckers then I would have had them steal a bunch of shit from other people so they wouldn't be poor, so screw them!" It's fascinating to watch people who first, claim to believe in Iron Age fairy tales and then two, don't even get the frigging fairy tale right! In Con world Jack and the bean stalk would be about how to monetize my magic beans and charge admission to climb the stalk. No refunds! Cons are seriously sick people!</comment>

<comment>They didn't, but not because they didn't believe a democratic society could instruct its government to guarantee shelter and food. The reason they didn't is that they were creating a federation government, by definition a type of government that concerns itself only with interstate issues, leaving the intrastate issues to each state to resolve.The Founders had no ideological opposition to the notion that the state, as directed by its master, the People, should feed its poor and care for its sick. If they had, they would have been sure to have mentioned it in the Constitution or Bill of Rights, something like, "No citizen shall be taxed on the pretense of benefiting another citizen" or something like that. But they didn't. The Founders were careful to lay down some basic ground rules, and beyond that, every state was supposed to be like a bedroom -- what happens inside is nobody's business.Actually, no, food and shelter were not big concerns at the time. They were in Britain but not in the US. Americans lived better than Brits did. Well, free Americans did, anyway. Even those who didn't own farm land could easily live by hunting and trapping. But most did own farm land. It wasn't expensive, and besides, most white indentured servants got land at the expiration of their contracts. When Ben Franklin visited Britain for the first time, he was astonished to see ragpickers, beggars, and street urchins. There was simply nothing like it in the US of the late 1700s.Slavery-based agrarianism. The US came before the Industrial Revolution.</comment>

<comment>Social democracy is what you're describing. He's not calling for the end of capitalism; he's proposing more checks (of the sort we already have) on capital to regain an equitable balance in favor of the majority of people. The current trajectory is plutocracy.</comment>

<comment>He's not calling for "checks on capital."  He's calling for a very large redistribution of income and the creation of even more entitlements.  That sounds great on paper, but in real life there are very mixed results.  Small homogeneous countries like Denmark can support that system.  Other countries, like Greece and Venezuela, have wrecked their countries with that system.   The chances of it working in a country as diverse and large as the US is very slim.</comment>

<comment>Another key factor in recognizing an ignorant Con is the use of the word "redistribution."  See normal intelligent people recognize that "redistribution" occurs all the time in all economies but the simplistic Con mind is so damaged and ignorant that they equate the word with some other meaning of "stealing" from the wealthy,  And even more fascinating is that every trailer park red neck and every joe six pack idiot thinks he's part of the wealthy elite and they're coming to take his money.  This is in no small part to the sick people who have continued to promote the idea to these morons that somehow they're better than those darker skinned "moochers."  Only the fundamentally ignorant could fall for such stupidity.  I'm a white Southerner, my family has been in Alabama for over 200 years and through the continued research of my father we have found that our family has "mooched" off the government starting 200 years ago with taking freebie in land grants from the government.  And yet my ancestors had towns areas named for them?  Weird, how could they have been so respected when they were taking handouts from the government?  It must be a very tragic life to live when saddled with the ignorance of the Con mind.</comment>

<comment>Of course redistribution occurs.  A customer buys my company's goods--redistribution.  My company pays me--redistribution.  I go buy goods--redistribution.  But all of that is voluntary.  A larger tax burden for the sole purpose of income redistribution can be considered a boon to the poor on one hand or a massive government overreach on the other.  It's pretty clear which side we're on.  BTW, that government land grant was the government giving its OWN property away.  It didn't take property from the top ten landowners in Alabama, then divvy it up and hand it out to a bunch of white trash like your family.  What Bernie wants to do is very different.  He wants to take even more of other people's property and give it to more white trash like you and your family.  It's easy for you to elide this point because you were educated in a state that's an enigma wrapped in a riddle wrapped in illiteracy.  And Bernie's idea is that basically the government is smarter than you and knows how to spend your money better than you.  Despite your white trash circumstances and laughable compulsory education standards, I'm assuming from the tenor of you comments that you have absolute confidence in your intelligence.  Great.  Bernie doesn't.  He knows what's best, kind of like a father or maybe a big brother.</comment>

<comment>Every time you say "homogenous," my dog jumps up and looks around. So because we have Negroes, we can't have nice things? Really?</comment>

<comment>FDR taxed the rich at 94%. That was the largest redistribution in America which also funded social security, the WPA, and created the necessary conditions for the middle class to arise. The privatizers have been working to reverse this ever since and are working like hell to get what they want. But it is NOT what the people want.</comment>

<comment>The U.S. is a socialist government. It has a huge influence on the distribution of wealth. But the distribution is being funnelled into programs that benefit only a small minority of American citizens. That wealth is then reinvested into propping up and supporting government representation that will maintain or broaden the minorities' hold on that wealth. The most grievous example of this is the bailout. Ultimately, it may have been necessary to stave off disaster, but the disaster wasn't built upon the backs of the majority of U.S. citizens. A wealthy minority played loose and fast with the rules (or the lack of rules) and almost imploded the economy (and did implode the economy of middle class individuals). Yet there's still advocacy for this "status quo." It's not a status quo anymore. It has deteriorated dramatically since the early 90s. You know one of the biggest "socialist" programs in the U.S. that no one seems to acknowledge is the military. It's a money pit that props up an ideology that has proven to have done more harm than good (going on 50 years now). This stuff needs to be addressed, the "socialist" system that currently exist isn't doing enough for the majority of its members. Adjustments need to be made and "status quo" ideology needs to be questioned. To not, allows for special interests to manipulate the system to their benefit and so far this has proven problematic. If allowed to continue, it will prove disastrous.</comment>

<comment>I doubt very strongly that you have the Framers in agreement with your views of government, nor do I particularly care even if you did. Do notice that the "Founders" completely re-did our government within their lifetime and Jefferson believed the Constitution should be thrown out and rewritten every 10 years to better reflect the times. Calling your stance "American" is just nauseating considering how little you did to earn such a title.As for not being scared, perhaps you're right and I misjudged you (very plausible). Hopefully you would acknowledge Bernie isn't even a socialist even as he embraces the title of democratic socialist. His policy views are mainstream even as they're "radical" when put alongside what our corrupt politicians consider acceptable.The size of the country undertaking large social safety nets are a concern but it mainly depends on how far the safety net is taken. What is clear however, is that our current safety net isn't working and corruption within our allocation of wealth is out of hand in this country.</comment>

<comment>Even the Founders didn't  think they had created a suicide pact. Thomas Jefferson was of the opinion that we should start over from scratch every 19 years (odd number, but that's what he said).And Sanders is not proposing anything that FDR wouldn't have proposed. He's not proposing Soviet-style communism. He's proposing that we be more like the Northern European countries, whose systems are not all about the 1%. In the US, all interests have been aligned in favor of a tiny minority of very wealthy people. Anybody from the 1950s would be horrified.Why are you so against changing the current system?</comment>

<comment>I like Sanders, but this was a puff piece by any measure and more appropriate for an inflight magazine.  Because anyone on other side of the ticket is a certain path to double the pain of the eight years under Bush, if Sanders wins the nomination he has my vote.</comment>

<comment>But you won't vote for him in your state's primary or caucus?</comment>

<comment>Still undecided.</comment>

<comment>Awesome! As long as you're thinking about it, that's what matters. Thanks for keeping an open mind.</comment>

<comment>The Craplantic strikes again!</comment>

<comment>Based on his being mayor of Burlington and Senator from Vermont I hope he has a better understanding of Canadian -USA relations. President Obama has proven woefully ignorant (or that might just be indifference) to America's most important bilateral relationship. His administration has made crossing the Canadian/USA border even more unpleasant that under President Bush. He has even authorized the start of drone use over the border. Obama could not even rouse himself enough to get a new bridge built between Detroit and Windsor. Of course that might just mean that he valued the political contributions of Manuel Moroun more than trade with Canada.</comment>

<comment>I don't care if Bernie had zero interest in foreign policy, a claim some of Hillary's surrogates have been making. I'll still take him over the Democratic Margaret Thatcher. Hillary voted for a war that so many of us knew was based on lies. For her to go along with it tells me she's either a liar or just an idiot. The lesson of Iraq was "don't topple dictators if you have no idea what to do afterwards." It's a lesson she apparently failed to learn since she pushed for regime change in Libya as well and now seems to be leaning in that direction in Syria. A lot of Americans think women can't be strong leaders. The problem with Hillary is that she's focused on proving that she's as tough as any man. IMO, that's why she voted for Iraq War. It's as if she feels the need to compensate for her gender. I don't want that kind of leader. We already had a President who was obsessed with showing the world how tough he is.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is an economic nationalist, similar to Trump. He is not a socialist. A socialist's perspective on Bernie->http://www.wsws.org/en/article...</comment>

<comment>Bernie was right about voting against the Iraq war it was a huge mistake. He and others have very right to criticize the government on foreign policy. We do poke our noses into other people's business at times. I also don't understand why we are so far up the backside of Israel. They say jump and we say how high no matter what party is in the White House. President Obama maybe the first one to keep somewhat of a distance but at the end of the day we hear 'our good friend Israel' from him as well. Good friend! We are their good friend! Keep giving them money. They have land, sea and air troops. The iron dome. Even nuclear weapons for Gods sake. Just what help do they need?</comment>

<comment>Face it Boomers.....you no longer own the election process.</comment>

<comment>This is a sterling article, much needed.The man is anything but a foreign policy lightweight: the man is rad!He is the conscience of the US political culture, for what, thirty years.  And nobody knew for a long time, but that was immaterial to his feeling of obligation to justice and truthful public conversation world-wide.He was one of us in the 60's, who knew what Dylan was talking about in Masters of War, and he never varied from that clarion call.Which other politician has held fast all these decades?  I can't think of one.  Wellstone, maybe, but they killed him.  Kucinich tried hard, but he couldn't muster the angular momentum, the flywheel effect that Bernie has got whining now.I stand in awe of this man, and I'm putting all my meager weight behind him and this movement, because that's what it's all about.Once again, many many thanks for a superb and classy article.Check out this relevant clip — no other candidate would admit these things.</comment>

<comment>I'm no fan of Bernie Sanders but his foreign travel are to his credit. Its the height of patriotism to pretest polices you believe are wrong and when he went to foreign countries, including our "enemies" to criticize US policy, he did it in a respectful, dignified manner. Our Nicaragua policy in the 80's was very wrong (and as it turns out, highly illegal), we SHOULD have normalized relations with Cuba long ago and the Cold War DID cost the US money and time better spent on other things. I imagine the Chinese must have found it odd to hear a man criticize US corporations while in their country - corporations that were selling Chinese made goods at a high markup. From their perspective, it was probably that US companies were ripping off the Chinese workers for the benefit of US consumers.Regardless, its usually a good thing when US government officials travel abroad and demonstrate that Americans are not a monolithic block and not all US policies enjoy unified American support - especially if those policies are unpopular abroad. Compared to Dick Cheney insulting Obama from the living room of the Saudi king, or John McCain trying to pick a fistfight with Nicaraguan diplomates, I'd say Bernie showed restraint, dignity and class.</comment>

<comment>If you want to talk about which relatively recent Presidents did more harm to our image overseas due to bad policy decisions, hone in one the years 1992-2016.  As a result, a voting majority would like to see less hubris in our foreign policy-period.</comment>

<comment>We first have to live up to our own ideals before we can tell anyone else how to live...#FeelTheBern </comment>

<comment>You'll settle for Killary.</comment>

<comment>Bernie has yellow teeth.</comment>

<comment>A Bernie Sanders presidency would likely not have included overthrowing the Democratically elected government of Mossadegh in Iran, which would have forestalled the Iranian revolution that overthrew the Shah the US placed on the thrown.More unintended consequences, like Hillary's support for regime change in Iraq and Libya.</comment>

<comment>Didn't Donald Trump already call The Bern out as pretty much of a Communist? </comment>

<comment>I do not like Bernie Sanders' past at all at all.  He really doesn't seem to give a @#$# about family.  I don't like his divorce to his first wife, I don't like his having had a child by a girlfriend he didn't stay with, and I absolutely do NOT like his current wife as First Lady.Of course, on the other hand, when I take a look at Hillary Clinton I scream from the horror of the nasty possibilities this weirdo could bring upon us.  Basically she's a white Obama, and a female Bill Clinton, 2 of the worst presidents ever.Think I'll stick to Republicans.</comment>

<comment>I hope based on that comment you aren't a Trump supporter or you are a hypocrite on that divorce thing.</comment>

<comment>I think divorce is horrific for society, for kids, for human beings.  I think people are getting divorced for stupid sh*t.  I think people have an infantile way of looking at relationships.As for Trump - I have no clue what to think of Trump.  I will say this - his popularity is due to the fact that he rejects political correctness.  People are tired, exhausted, sick of PC.</comment>

<comment>If you are writing off Bernie Sanders because of a divorce and do not write Trump off who has had multiple divorces, then yeah.. double standard.That's not even getting into the "moral" question of whether divorce is right or wrong.</comment>

<comment>Divorce is almost always done for the wrong reasons, and it damages  everyone involved.</comment>

<comment>Divorce = Bad when Sanders does it.Trump gets divorced = I don't know what to think of him.Not seeing the consistency.I know why Trump is popular. What many people view as "not being PC," I just translate to the "I want the right to be as offensive as possible and be applauded for it." He also tells some people what they want to hear. "I'll make America great again. You'll be sick of winning so much. I'll build the wall and Mexico will pay for it." Let's not even get into what he's said about Muslims and repeat other things he's said about Mexicans. He plays into the worst part of human nature. Fear, anger, nationalism.. it all sells very well. He is a businessman. He knows his market and his product.End of rant.</comment>

<comment>I'm not fond of Trump's family life.  Nor Bernie's.As for Muslims, I'm guessing you want hordes of Muslims in the U.S., huh?</comment>

<comment>Imagine having a US president that spent decades traveling, learning & researching the world so as to pursue the best policies in his political job serving Americans?    Not as sexy as bloviating about biblical mandates or massaging EU presidents?</comment>

<comment>This is all very nice. But (and I say this as a strong Sanders supporter) it needs to be distilled into a coherent worldview that the Senator actually talks about and connects to his domestic agenda. His heart is in the right place, but his garbled pronouncements on foreign policy aren't enough to match the coherence of Clinton's neoconservatism. And we need something strong and coherent and actionable, infused by social democratic values, to meet what Clinton is selling.</comment>
