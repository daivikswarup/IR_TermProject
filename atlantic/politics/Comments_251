<comment>A president elected by a coalition of the poorly educated and the evangelical poor.  What could possibly go wrong?</comment>

<comment>Those are your countrymen.</comment>

<comment>They are citizens of Eagleland, which I'm not entirely convinced is the same country as America</comment>

<comment>How is this kind of rhetoric any different from that of some conservatives who call liberals un-American?</comment>

<comment>Balkanize. Let us go. Have your Bernieland on the coasts.</comment>

<comment>If the US does Balkanize, good luck trying to run Trumpland without the tax income that comes from Bernieland states.</comment>

<comment>You mean like Texas?We also won't need high taxes after all the worthless people flee for the coasts. </comment>

<comment>Wonder if the new liberal land will allow open immigration when the welfare class faces their income cuts if they don't go to work?</comment>

<comment>Where would you get your military protection from? I'll wait.......</comment>

<comment>I'm sure we could beat it out of you little men.</comment>

<comment>Food and Oil from flyover States will be priced accordingly for the Liberals to pay for.</comment>

<comment>A large % of U.S. food comes from California.Either secede or be an American. Choose a side, fake patriot.</comment>

<comment>Not after Water from the Colorado River stops.</comment>

<comment>Another problem fake patriots in red states have is a failure to understand geography.</comment>

<comment>You don't understand that previous agreements would be voided.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>You mean Colorado who voted D for president 2008 & 2012?  That place with legal grass and a top destination for immigrants?   I think in 2013 they voted in one of the strongest voting rights packages in the nation increasing turnout.</comment>

<comment>Still Flyover country.And Colorado doesn't control all the River, Cali has to worry about the States in-between</comment>

<comment>If they're lucky the fertile and productive farm lands of California will secede from the coastal disaster.</comment>

<comment>Food and oil are available on the global market, and "flyover" states (I'm typing this from the dreaded Flyoverland) aren't as red as you think they are.  Even if you succeed in succeeding, demographic shifts suggest Trumpland would eventually morph into something resembling Bernieland.   Progress has a pesky way of continually rolling forward, whether you want to keep up with it or not.</comment>

<comment>Look at the county map for Red v. Bluehttp://www-personal.umich.edu/...Mostly Red.</comment>

<comment>We will buy the grain and vegetable oils from Canada, which we might even confederate with.  California will produce the rest. We will also use the Mojave Desert to generate vast amounts of solar power.</comment>

<comment>Why do you think Canada will do that? Their Farmers will also like the resulting higher pricesYou still need real petroleum- Cars don't run on Canola or Solar.Cali still has around a quarter million electric and hybrids on the road, vs around 29M autos total.Besides, you would also lose power cheap power from Hoover Dam.Cali just has too many people living in desert to play with Autarky.</comment>

<comment>What are you going to pay for all of the stuff with?  Everyone knows in a socialist society EVERYONE is poor.  Except for the dear leaders.</comment>

<comment>Let the damn Yankees freeze in the dark!</comment>

<comment>Trumpland and Bernieland would be indistinguishable, except for the wall around Trumpland.</comment>

<comment>We will not need the same tax base as we do not believe government is necessary for livelyhood.</comment>

<comment>Maybe not "livelyhood", but it would obviously be useful for educational purposes.</comment>

<comment>bernieland would be devoid of productive, profitable businesses in six months. and filled with slack-offs looking for a free ride.</comment>

<comment>I feel at this point we must be able to come to some amicable solution to this. If the South agrees not to come up North to capture any more slaves, I feel like we can deal with that.</comment>

<comment>That sounds reasonable.In exchange we would ask that no more Yankees move to Florida. They can come visit but that's it.Restrictions:1. A week in the summer- restricted to the Tampa/Orlando/Cocoa Beach belt as followings:  a. No further than 10miles north or south of the Beachline Expressway to the east and b. No further than 30 miles north or south of Interstate 4 to the west.2.  90days in the winter - restricted to an area south of Tampa Bay and west of Interstate 75.Exceptions:Miami-Dade County shall be open to all who wish to risk their lives but any who enter shall have neither criminal nor civil recourse against the State of Florida nor it's representatives for any harm that may come to them either physically or mentally as a result of entering this zone.Deal?</comment>

<comment>I'm actually perfectly okay with no Yankees moving to Florida ever. No problem. My only regret is that Arizona would probably prefer to be with Texas and New Mexico, with California and the rest of the west/north. I'm not sure what to do about that. We can't just move all of Tuscon to Albuquerque. Other than that it should go pretty smoothly.</comment>

<comment>Nah, we have the guns and all of their men are girly men. I'm pretty sure we could take it all.</comment>

<comment>We don't need that many guns you silly billy.We make the bombers... and the bombs. And the hackers. And the chemical weapons. And the nuclear power for dirty bombs.This always struck me as comical. Like, I get that people have a gun to protect their TV from getting stolen, which is apparently worse than, you know, killing a thief, at least in the south. But having a gun to wage revolution against the most well-armed, highly militarized nation int he world?That's just adorable.</comment>

<comment>All the fighting men would be red staters.  Blue staters are momma's boys like their dear leader obama.</comment>

<comment>Hey, don't let the spring door hit your tukus on the way out.</comment>

<comment>I'm with you. How great would it be if the two parties could no longer demagogue about the evil "others". Like either party has done a particularly good job. We have debt 100% of GDP and have had 2% GDP growth for 15 years with median income flat for that 15 years. The transition to the 21st century has been dismal under (D) control AND (R) control.</comment>

<comment>If you support Trump, you are supporting the equivalent of Sanders. They are both leftists, but at least Sanders supporters actually realize they are following a lefty.</comment>

<comment>Short answer: It isn't. </comment>

<comment>The hyper aggressive non English speaking aliens you see clogging up traffic all over  this country doing landscape work  are 99.9 percent illegal aliens. They can't be vetted like Americans. There is no social security number that tracks them for life in the countries they are from. You have no way to know if they are murderers, child molesters, or the anti Christ, because the third world hovels they are from are not automated and don't keep records. You really can't reliably vet individuals from third world societies. Even the millions of Indian computer programmers imported to the US can't be vetted. That's why they should all be deported and only the best allowed back in, after they have been thru a meaningful vetting process, that must be devised. Also, when corporations bring unvetted individuals into our society, they should assume liablility in the form of some type of bond. The open borders philosophy defies all common sense. That's why its almost too easy to win the debate against the open border proponents. The open border proponents don't even have the moral high ground. Because to proscribe any moral component to the open borders philosophy, you have to ignore and deny the harm this philosophy does to the native born, particularly the most vulnerable of the native born.</comment>

<comment>"the hyper aggressive non English speaking aliens you see clogging up traffic all over this country doing landscape work are 99.9 percent illegal aliens"That explains all of those dead white land owners strewn all over our green lawns and floating in our pools.  It also explains why all those BMW's are abandoned on the side of the road in LAX and good hard working Americans can't get to work.  I wondered.</comment>

<comment>You have the voice of a foreigner, Xenophon!</comment>

<comment>Is that the same as the United States?</comment>

<comment>Do you have to keep reminding us. Jeez!!</comment>

<comment>I wonder if you like illegal immigrants better?"Unauthorized immigrants tend to be near the bottom of the U.S. skill distribution and to hold low-wage jobs. Almost half of adult unauthorized immigrants have not completed high school, and they comprise a startling 22 percent of all non–high school graduates in the United States.http://object.cato.org/…/f…/ca...…more family members crossed illegally to join legalization beneficiaries in the United States…giving an almost universal amnesty to una..."Even worse educated and more fatalist than your countrymen.</comment>

<comment>See the link in my first comment. Trump would deport all illegal aliens, then let the "best" back in. Due to politics (the Dems, business interests, far-left NGOs filing lawsuits, etc.) that means most illegal aliens would come back as legal residents.Add in the big door in the Trump Wall, and Big Business would have a field day.The alternative is to do things the smart way for once.</comment>

<comment>He said only some (the best ones) will be let back in, after undergoing a vetting process. The vetting process must be meaningful. It will also be smart to make corporations put some skin in the game, by requiring them to post some type of security bond for these individuals.  If Trump is elected, the voters will just have to keep him honest about this.</comment>

<comment>Something needs to be done but the ecosystem has evolved to such degree that Trump's word sound like another politician's sound bite. We have all kinds of relations from synnecrosis, commensalism and mutualism to parasitism; we need effective co-operation but it is difficult when the relation is not balanced.</comment>

<comment>I have a question, if all these 11 million undocumented are hidden in our society, how do we know so much about them?</comment>

<comment>Your ignored and overlooked countrymen.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  I'd advise intelligent liberals to disassociate from those who seem to forget their loyalty to the U.S. and enjoy deriding their fellow countrymen and women who are not as intelligent as themselves.</comment>

<comment>nothing new thereDuring his 1956 presidential campaign, a woman called out to Mr. Stevenson "Senator, you have the vote of every thinking person!" Stevenson called back "That's not enough, madam, we need a majority!"</comment>

<comment>Did I say there was?This is pulling a fire alarm.  Even though it's been done before, it's still  necessary to do again from time-to-time.</comment>

<comment>Yep. I believe that there are socio-political re-boots. This could be one of them.</comment>

<comment>Always liked that one!!!</comment>

<comment>Hm.  People who enjoy deriding unintelligent fellow Americans are - Progressives who laugh at Trump supporters for thinking that the Big Boss is interested in raising their pay.</comment>

<comment>Per se, I don't think they "believe" that.I think they correctly deduce that they MAY benefit -- psychologically,  if nothing else -- from a reduction of illegal immigration in the US and its depressive effect on wage-rates, from tariffs which may encourage domestic-manufacturing of certain goods and from favorable corporate tax-rates and corporate tax-enforcement which will strongly encourage the repatriation of hundreds of billions of dollars which corporations have sheltered-abroad and which may, then, be engaged in the domestic economy or at least contributing to the nation's tax base (and perhaps used to pay workers decently to build new roads, schools,  and public works).   </comment>

<comment>"I think they correctly deduce that they MAY benefit..."That's it in a nutshell. The feel that with the opposite choice, they have little to no chance of any benefit.They perceive that with Obama this has not been the case, and further, would extend it to anyone from Obama's party.What I've found over the years is that all I need is to have a stable set of rules and to be left alone. Given this, I will be OK.I have not felt a sense of stability under Obama, although he needs to be given credit for certain accomplishments. He needs to be damned to the dustbin of history for dividing the citizenry along lines of race, sex, and wealth. He didn't need to do this, but perceived it was politically expedient during his term in office.That, and I suspect that it resonated with a certain ideological stance that he successfully concealed during the 2008 cycle.</comment>

<comment>Indeed. And they need a good talking to. They keep falling for charlatans, from Frank Bates (Power4Patriots, Seeds4Patriots, etc.) to Trump. Given a choice between a smart road and a lunkhead road, they invariably choose the lunkhead road. They're intellectually incapable of defending themselves against the depredations of the cultural far-left, and they're emotionally incapable of helping those who could help them against the cultural far-left.They're now following Trump, someone who has a mass *legalization* plan for illegal aliens:24ahead.com/n/12107Trump is the worst of both worlds: he proposes a completely unrealistic mass deportation plan *plus* a mass legalization program that would expand to cover most current illegal aliens. Plus, the Trump Wall would have big doors so Big Business can drive wages down even further.</comment>

<comment>Charlatans? You mean like Obama?</comment>

<comment>The "poorly educated" does not equate to "unintelligent." Often times it is the reverse. Of course the "over-educated" aka indoctrinated, couldn't be expected to recognize that.</comment>

<comment>The "poorly educated" does equate to ignorant though, and they are proving that this election.</comment>

<comment>Your mistake is in assuming that education equals understanding or access to balanced information. The wrong "education" can be worse than ignorance because it convinces it's pupils that the world operates in ways that it actually does not. The "poorly educated" i.e. those who didn't go to college, tend to have a gut level understanding of the way the world actually works.</comment>

<comment>No, really, the poorly educated are just that. Poorly educated, and generally lower intelligence, who fall prey to populist rhetoric that is irrational and fails on basic economic principles.</comment>

<comment>Wrong he won tops in 'highly educated' too  - all demographics fool. Research 1st. </comment>

<comment>Where?His core is the ignorant.  Just read the comments here.Besides, the majority of the highly educated vote D.</comment>

<comment>Like Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown?</comment>

<comment>Leave them out of this, they dindoo nuffin.</comment>

<comment>What, exactly, did Trayvon Martin do? Walk down the street while wearing a hoodie and carrying Skittles?</comment>

<comment>Mr Zimmerman was cleared of any wrongdoing. Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Indeed and look at what a model citizen he has been since then.</comment>

<comment>bouncing a noggin off  the pavement is nothing?</comment>

<comment>Travon wasn't old enough to vote. </comment>

<comment>Is that what passes for humor where you live?</comment>

<comment>nevada, trump won every demographic there.regardless, with all the BS progressive studies offered nowadays, and the general dumbing down of universities - to accommodate people the left are shoehorning in who are otherwise too stupid to be there - you could just as easily say the majority of people who went to adult daycare vote D.</comment>

<comment>Letting the intelligentsia run things hasn't worked out so hot for the past few decades, so yeah, how about we try populism again. Worked out pretty well for FDR and Truman, didn't it?</comment>

<comment>This is more like electing Eisenhower or Andrew Jackson, but without the military experience.</comment>

<comment>No, it's more like electing Frank Bates-meets-Sheldon Adelson.P.S. Why aren't more people wearing track suits at Trump events?</comment>

<comment>You're kidding, right?  Roosevelt was, and was surrounded by, the embodiment of the Northeastern, liberal elite.  More Obama than Trump, any day.</comment>

<comment>So? Trump is the embodiment of the northeastern, liberal elite, too. Doesn't change the fact that blue-collar workers were a - probably THE - core part of the New Deal coalition, and that Trump appeals to the grandkids of those blue-collar workers. Also doesn't change the fact that those elites despised FDR more than they currently despise Trump.</comment>

<comment>A president elected by the people !? Oh, the horror...</comment>

<comment>You mean, he might blow up even _more_ babies than the Nobel Peace Prize winner?</comment>

<comment>Nothing if it upsets idiotellectuals such as yourself.</comment>

<comment>My grandpa was not college educated yet he was one of the most intelligent and thoughtful men I have ever met. I'd say your comment reeks of elitism, however I assume you are college educated and therefore would never lower yourself to being a snob. A person's education level isn't necessarily a gauge of how intelligent they are, as your comment proves . It's much more likely to be a gauge of how wealthy their parents were, though not in every case. I would say the working non-college educated are in a much better position to know what this country needs to build up it's foundation and to alleviate the problems of the working poor then any college educated person ever could.</comment>

<comment>Great point just like asking an immigrant what is the problem with our immigration system, I mean, free for all.</comment>

<comment>"I would say the working non-college educated are in a much better position to know what this country needs to build up it's foundation . . . ."Based on what?  To date, they've failed to successfully demonstrate that in any way whatsoever.  In fact, they've failed to even demonstrate that they even know what they personally need to build up their OWN foundations.So now, they're victims of powers beyond their control - or, worse, of those "other people".  The fact is, their victims only of their own failures.  Failures to educate themselves and understand the crucial issues to their economic well being.  Failures to vote for politicians who might actually implement policies that might help them.  It's hard to accept, but they chose much of what they presently feel victimized by.I'm not offended by being labeled an elite.  After College, Grad School, Law School, years of contributing to the advancement of society and not just my own personal existence, I've earned it.  While I recognize that there are parts of this nation where there are serious economic problems, I also am in a position to understand that nothing Trump has offered to date is going to alleviate that suffering for these "victims".  Similarly, I'm damn certain I'm not going to idly permit the ignorant to use misdirected anger to spread their misery across the entire nation.  America, after all, is the wealthiest, most powerful country in the history of the world.</comment>

<comment>>contributing to the advancement of society>earned it>Law SchoolBAHAHAHAHAHA</comment>

<comment>From the story: "On the other front, polls show Trump leading in mostly white-collar, far less evangelical states including Vermont, Massachusetts, and Virginia."</comment>

<comment>The working class, who have been destroyed are now rebelling.  And it's about time.  Your contempt for the working class is palpable but just remember that pride comes before the fall.</comment>

<comment>They haven't been destroyed, merely have not been able to keep up.  Now they're displaying why their suffering, by throwing support at a charlatan who has offered no substantive plans to help them.  Their continued failure to channel their anger constructively may result in a Trump presidency, and thus the inevitability of their continued demise.</comment>

<comment>The difference between intelligent and stupid people, is the intelligent research things before buying into what they are told. The difference between a bias or intellectual preference and bigotry, is bigotry is rooted in ignorance. Reading the polls themselves over the mast  who have quickly dispelled the  NRO inspired mythology that Trump supporters were all poorly educated, with a few exceptions. But, had you actually read the exit polls of the primaries, you would know Trump has taken every single demographic, be it educational (all levels through post graduate, gender, rural, urban, religious, secular, independents (more than Clinton or Bernie) all income levels, moderates and conservative, and all races. So, speculation is over. Given your remarks are not informed by facts, I can only conclude you are a manipulated bigot.</comment>

<comment>You know as well as I do that his margins in SC were really only significant with the no college crowd.  Rubio and Cruz combined received more votes from educated voters.Trump likewise did very well on the issues of the ignorant - returning the Confederate flag to the Capitol, whites are victims of discrimination, etc.  It's not surprising, given he's running a shiny object, distraction campaign that is devoid of any articulated substance or policy.  Those issues on which he has offered some detail, suggest no benefit to these angry folks - unless they're actually in the top tax bracket?</comment>

<comment>Barack Obama</comment>

<comment>Clever, but, statistically speaking, Obama lost the evangelical vote in both '08 and '12.  He also won both the college and post-graduate educated demos.Or, were you trying to imply something about his overwhelming numbers with the black community?  I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you just didn't know the numbers, ok?</comment>

<comment>I know you nmean to use the term "poorly educated" as a slur, but the large percentage of the country who did not get to go to college and instead got technical training, or work in the trades still make a contribution to the country that we can't live without and they are not stupid. These are the people who make and maintain the plumbing, electrical, engines, powerplants, heavy equipment, air conditioning, elevators, and many other systems we all rely upon . The same people you look down on also make the steel, produce the oil and gas, supply the food, drive the trucks,  and build the cars.Try watching an episode or two of "Dirty Jobs" with Mike Rowe on discovery channel sometime and learn a little about the great working blue collar middle class that used to make up the majority of the American Electorate. The idiotic national policies on Trade and Immigration that are destroying the middle class and causing our massive trade deficit ( and therebye our budget deficit ), the flight of jobs and capital overseas, wage stagnation, low GDP, permanent structural unemployment/underemployment and a looming debt crisis are all things that Trump speaks to. The establishment of both parties is destroying America. The great unwashed masses whose job it is to slave away and never make any progress- whose job it is to work to pay for liberal utopia but not benefit from it because the programs are for people who do NOT work- are speaking through Trump ( an admittedly flawed messenger ). The idiots you look down upon are letting you know through him that they want national policies that actually benefit working Americans for a change. That used to be a universally accepted thing that such policies were a good thing. News flash for you Mr. white collar genius- in just a couple of years, we will be spending more paying interest on the national debt than we spend on national defense. And  FYI our borders are non existent. The president has told the border patrol to stand down and release everybody. And he is trying to bring a million muslims a year into the country LEGALLY. How did that work out for Europe mister smartypants? Achmed, Mohammed, and Tashfin will be living next door to your family too. Thank your lucky stars for the people you hold disdain for. They appear to be the last bastion of common sense that remains in the country. Maybe they can pull us back from the abyss before its too late.</comment>

<comment>If you had read the article, you would have seen that the phrase "poorly educated" is the one Trump himself used to describe those folks.  Judging by the substance, structure, and grammar in your post, I see you may be one of them.  From what I can manage make out of your rant, however, you appear to be seriously misinformed about a great deal of things.  For example, there is not a single, supportable fact in any of this gibberish:"FYI our borders are non existent. The president has told the border patrol to stand down and release everybody. And he is trying to bring a million muslims a year into the country LEGALLY."</comment>

<comment>Does that not describe minorities you racist?</comment>

<comment>Senseless.  It describes the Trump voters, no mention of race, as detailed in the article. Perhaps you read it?</comment>

<comment>You sir don't seem to understand that a factory worker or farm hand may not be highly educated but he is smart enough to know when things are going very wrong.   I have lots of education.  More than you can imagine.  I have learned that these people are very smart and really do know how to run their own lives and they are sick of the arrogant people who by virtue of a document given to them by "the wizard of OZ" think that they should be able to rule over those who carry the weight in the country.</comment>

<comment>"[S]mart enough to know when things are going very wrong."The question is, are they smart enough, knowledgeable enough, to know what to do about it.  Supporting Trump suggests the answer is a resounding, "No".</comment>

<comment>Aren't poorly educated folks going to vote Democrat, too? What is the difference? Poorly educated folks are all across the United States.</comment>

<comment>just look at the past 7 years.</comment>

<comment>My husband just voted Trump in early voting. He is the VP of risk management for the North American division of one of France's largest companies. I literally screamed at him when I heard this. I'll give you his explanation. I'm not voting for a socialist. Hillary is corrupt. Cruz is crazy. Rubio has no experience at anything and is just a GOP puppet creation. Trump is no worse than the rest, and he doesn't talk about abortion every time he opens his mouth.</comment>

<comment>Frankly, ggm, your husband's views and mine are not far apart.  Overall, it's a pretty horrible group of candidates.  I think where he and I disagree is that Hillary is any more corrupt than Trump.  (After all, he's one of her donors.  There's a lot of irony in that alone.)The other difficulty is that Trump has yet to articulate any viable policies that would do anything he's promised.  Bankrupting the nation to build a wall and deport immigrants, will not alleviate middle class woes, but will actually take a net benefit out of the economy.  Likewise, I believe in the cherished, foundational notions of America - Trump, on the other hand, only believes in "Trump".All in all, it really kind of sucks.</comment>

<comment>Very little.  The self styled elites (overeducated atheists)  Have been running this country during it's decline.  Logically, for those too educated to think, If they keep running the country, the decline will continue.  To put in terms simple enough for the over educated to understand;The establishment (You can used other words such as elites, Mandarins, Cronies ) has been driving the clown car off the cliff since 2008.  The passengers are tired of it and want control of the clown car.  Since the passengers outnumber the establishment, they will gain control.I don't think Trump can be stopped.  He can beat Hillary.  Trump is the change that Obama promised.  Young democrats have figured that out and will vote accordingly.  Only history can determine if Trump is a good POTUS.  Anyone with a brain, no matter how damaged by education, can see Trump is better then Hillary.  After all, isn't that the question?   Trump isn't perfect and if he was foolish enough to claim he was, one of his ex-wives would correct him.  He is, however, good enough.  Only a fool gives away good enough on the off chance of finding perfection.  Only God is perfect.  Trump isn't god but then again none of the candidates are.</comment>

<comment>No worries, Trump's winning plenty of college grads, including those of us with advanced degrees like me. Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Didn't you also read he is leading with white collar college educated voters as well in Mass, Vermont, etc.The fact is the people are fed up with the ruling class. Only the plantation, naive and elite voters support the party whether Republican or Democrat.  </comment>

<comment>MZale - you sir - are a snob!</comment>

<comment>This is what happen when Average Joe stop caring about artificial lines dividing people like God, Guns, and Gays, and start caring about the real line that divide people and their interests: Class</comment>

<comment>That sounds vaguely marxist</comment>

<comment>Trumpism is ideologically flexible.</comment>

<comment>by the minute/tweet</comment>

<comment>"Religion is the opium of the people" - Karl MarxBut that's not my point. I have no problem with Christians except when they get driven around like sheep by shrewd politicians over issues like God, Guns & Gays. I'm exited to see that they finally are waking up and realizing that they've been screwed by establishment all along</comment>

<comment>Lol.  A billionaire tells them that he can give them the world, offers no specifics, and feeds them slogans instead of meat. Have they finally woken up, Claus? Have you?</comment>

<comment>Rather than promises from an old Socialist or a creature of Wall Street?</comment>

<comment>Marxist as in Karl Marx's claim that the defining force in history has been class struggle. Which is a hypothesis that I have some issues with, (not even getting into the butchering of Hegel that is Das Kapital) as helpful as it may be in understanding some things.</comment>

<comment>Marx had some points but as many philosophers and politicians before and after him, he fell prey to intellectual hubris believing his insights were the ruling force of the UniverseClass certainly plays an important role in today's societies. It is a much more dividing force than any other in contemporary USA, yet until Trump it was virtually absent from the political discourseI don't believe class is the only force, culture may be even more important, but realizing that class is a factor is progress at least</comment>

<comment>Absent? Republicans have been whining about class warfare everytime Democrats try roll back top income tax cuts. You obviously weren't paying attention to John Edwards campaign either.Of course the history of Marxism is that all they end up doing is replacing one establishment without another.</comment>

<comment>Dems have done their best to deride the Guns and God crowd for over a decade now.Surprised they moved to Team R?I'm not</comment>

<comment>Guns and god crowd has been over there since at least the late 70's. History didn't begin at the millennium, I should know</comment>

<comment>The problem with a reductionist approach is that it isn't just one of these things. They're all parts of a larger identity, one that many of these people feel is strongly threatened. It's a mistake to think you can win them over just by appealing on one aspect, while they think you're a serious threat to one or more of the other aspects, or even if they just don't identify with you as being sufficiently "like them" in those ways. One of the things that Trump has managed to succeed at is getting these voters to feel like he's on their side, one of them, and they now identify with him, which is why he has such a core of support. It comes from the heart/gut, not from the head. The latter can be changed a lot more easily than the former.</comment>

<comment>I talk about what happens internally in the GOP. Just read through the article and notice how the author and his sources divide people based on religion and try to assign them to certain politiciansI don't buy it. It's a false narrative. The real fault line is not between more or less religious establishment candidates but between candidates more or less aligned with the establishment</comment>

<comment>No, it's both, but ignore religion at your peril. It's a significant fault line and has been since 1980. </comment>

<comment>>> since 1980Last millennia. Times change</comment>

<comment>I am with your line of thought, though I can't believe even DjT would buy his own words.Maybe a variant of your theory? I think the electorate can get behind the idea of a protest/repudiation vote on the establishment. So far this line of thought explains a lot that seems to escape ALL the pro commentators, whatever their political stripes</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, poor white trash doesn't interest me.</comment>

<comment>reverse racism is good, eh?</comment>

<comment>That isn't racist.</comment>

<comment>Because only Whitey can be racist, yes?</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>And team R can have them, with my compliments.</comment>

<comment>So don't cry when Hill loses by a slim margin, provided by them</comment>

<comment>Meh, their guns and god won't save them. In the end they'll just be shooting themselves in the foot.</comment>

<comment>After which, due to a lack of adequate medical treatment, they will meet their maker in person.</comment>

<comment>MOVED to Team R?  You're seriously suggesting this began in 2006?</comment>

<comment>I think Marx was a fairly astute economic observer.The medicine he prescribed, however, was not so astute.</comment>

<comment>He's an interesting thinker to be sure as far as economics go. Its where his economics crosses over into philosophy and discussions about what is dialectically necessary that I start having serious bones to pick with him and his very impressive beard</comment>

<comment>Mar was the classic "High IQ genius" with little common sense. Especially where it relates to human nature.</comment>

<comment>His children were starving, he lived off of other peoples' money(multiple inheritances, cash from Engels) but decided that labor was beneath him, so he could write.Nobody could make a living from just writing back then.But he tried, and mooched his way thru life</comment>

<comment>I agree with this assessment.  Marxism is terrifying not because it acknowledges class struggle or the naturally accumulating power of capital, but because it is totalitarian in thought and action.  The Marxist cannot tolerate the notion of being wrong, because Marxism is the very end of human progress, the pinnacle of social and intellectual perfection.  It's a perfectly circular philosophy.Once Marxism has power there is nothing except Marxism.</comment>

<comment>But vaguely Marxist, i.e. Marxist in analysis, isn't so bad.The totalitarian part is bad.</comment>

<comment>The Marxist can, the Bolshevik cannot. Most Marxists aren't violent revolutionaries, and sort of understand that pure Marxism can't be forced from on high.</comment>

<comment>Vaguely? I thought we had permission what with Sanders as the candidate to be openly Marxist. I write this as someone who is somewhat sympathetic to Marx (but not entirely).</comment>

<comment>You're overthinking Bernie.  He is not driven by an academic theory; he wants for the US to be like Denmark or Finland.</comment>

<comment>Bullshit. Poor minorities hate Trump.</comment>

<comment>Minorities don't count in the Trump analysis.</comment>

<comment>Trump is running a racial campaign.</comment>

<comment>Class is actually even more artificial than ideology.</comment>

<comment>Does tribe trump class?</comment>

<comment>If that were true they'd vote for Bernie. </comment>

<comment>The Republican voters are in revolt. The DNC establishment seem to have quelled their rebellion as Sanders is expected to go down in flames when he hit Hillary's racialist "firewall" in the South :-(</comment>

<comment>What does Trump's mojo imply for the Democrats?</comment>

<comment>The Democrats will probably win the White House. It will take a cycle or two for the changes Trump is making to the electorate to play out.</comment>

<comment>Never happen...women like Trump...only the bitter, angry ones will vote for Bubba's wife.</comment>

<comment>There are a lot of bitter angry unmarried women in America.</comment>

<comment>We all know what they need............</comment>

<comment>Not enough.</comment>

<comment>Wow.</comment>

<comment>You sound like you know a lot about women.</comment>

<comment>Only the one I married, and still not that much.</comment>

<comment>Let's see: he's pro abortion, uses illegal immigrant labor, has a history of donating to liberals, pro-gun control, but he draws huge crowds for his speeches.I'm trying hard to distinguish this guy from Obama.Ted Cruz for President 2016 and 2020</comment>

<comment>Total lies. Dems without reading comprehension are pathetic. </comment>

<comment>I'm not sure I would call someone who posts "Ted Cruz for President" a Dem.</comment>

<comment>Trying to remember Obama's use of illegal immigrants. </comment>

<comment>So which-Koch brother-owned-empty-suit do you intend to vote for?</comment>

<comment>Looks to me like Christie is hoping to be named as Trump's running mate!</comment>

<comment>Fat chance.</comment>

<comment>I see what you did there. Lol</comment>

<comment>In the beginning, the Trump candidacy was amusing, and I figured he'd be long gone by 2016. That he has garnered so much support astonishes me. In every election you'll find people projecting their own thoughts and desires on candidates -- I recall one notable Obama supporter who thought he would give her free gas for her car -- but I cannot wrap my head around what is happening with Trump. How can so many people look at him without actually seeing him? Are people just blind? Not that the rest of the field looks much better, but come on!</comment>

<comment>informed Americans understand that Hillary is epidemy of deceit and corruption while establishment USA political establishment lives in comfort at expense of average citizen</comment>

<comment>👆An uneducated Trumpster diver; It's epitome fool, not "epidemy". You don't even know how to use the spell check function.</comment>

<comment>Lame to go after someone on casual comment board about typos being from "uneducated". Especially when you are one from the 65% Obama 'poorly educated' voters. </comment>

<comment>That wasn't a spelling error, more of a language error. </comment>

<comment>The comment box automatically applies spellcheck. Think about that for a second.</comment>

<comment>Go look at your Reagan picture book.</comment>

<comment>He troll from Russia.  English not first language.</comment>

<comment>Recalcitrant Polish Trump worker??</comment>

<comment>I thought Putin was referring to  a skin condition.</comment>

<comment>They don't need to use spell-check, it's automatically applied as you write. Which really makes you wonder how anyone could misspell anything.</comment>

<comment>You hit it on the last line.  The American people are so disgusted with the political/media establishment that attacking it gives Trump a level of credibility that no other candidate can match.  That's why he is picking fights with everyone.  Did you hear him today, that he wants to make it easier to sue newspapers for libel?  He knows the more vigorously they run him down, the higher his standing will rise.  And, the more and more the whole process looks like a circus, the more people's expectations are diminished, the more acceptable he begins to appear</comment>

<comment>Trump is true man of the people.</comment>

<comment>Sure, if "the people" were all take-no-prisoners corporatists who grew up in extreme privilege and would sell their own children for a profit. But you go on drinking that Koolaid.</comment>

<comment>Trumps speaks for those who have no power with political establishment.</comment>

<comment>Hahahahahahha! Good one!</comment>

<comment>"Just over a year ago, two political scientists, one from Princeton, one from Northwestern, Gilens and Page, did a study looking very carefully at about over 2,000 policy issues. And their conclusion was that the wealthy and big corporations and Wall Street were the only ones that had any influence.The average American had literally no influence at all.According to an investigation by The New York Times, half of all the money contributed so far to Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, $176 million, has come from just 158 families, along with the companies they own or control.I used to think — and I used to write about it — inequality as being the result of globalization, technological change. But what has happened, particularly over the last 20 years, is that there is a third factor, political power. It is this vicious cycle of the wealthy and big corporations and Wall Street getting rule changes, legal changes that advantage them and really disadvantage most other people." PBS</comment>

<comment>So then you think the answer is to vote for a billionaire who is only wealthy because he was born that way.Makes sense.</comment>

<comment>Which is to say, illegals, who have neither money nor votes. Trump loves to hire illegals, because they work for 60 cents on the dollar.</comment>

<comment>Man of the people = 40% of one American political party that gets minuscule amounts of the minority vote.</comment>

<comment>SO, you just now realized it's a turnout election.</comment>

<comment>Any nominee with an R next to their name is guaranteed 45% of the vote in the general election.</comment>

<comment>Maybe 42-43, but point made.</comment>

<comment>Enjoy defeat. I want Trump and his supporters committing suicide in their trailer parks.</comment>

<comment>If your people forget to blow the grass clippings off my driveway one more time..</comment>

<comment>Don't worry, with demographics being the way they are and open borders, one of us will remember eventually.</comment>

<comment>Forget it. I might have to pay them more than $5 for the privilege of cleaning up after me if they actually did a good job.</comment>

<comment>Won't matter with a white minority.</comment>

<comment>I plan on finishing the plunder of this continent that my ancestors started and leaving if it ever starts to look like a losing deal.</comment>

<comment>Please leave, we won't miss you.</comment>

<comment>I need all my kids to be born here so they can get citizenship before I finally upsticks. Mail those Social Security and Government Pension checks to my address in Fribourg, thanks!</comment>

<comment>You should be beating up a queer, since you're a homophobe.</comment>

<comment>I hear Rubios not a homophobe.............</comment>

<comment>Rumor has it Rubio is ridiculously gay</comment>

<comment>Where you gonna go? Mars?</comment>

<comment>Ah yes, it's only bigotry if you're not the one saying it, right?</comment>

<comment>I've always realized this troll. Eat shit and say something substantial.</comment>

<comment>Goodness but you're a rude 'little' guy.</comment>

<comment>He virulently hates gays.Something is wrong with him,</comment>

<comment>Only to people who waste my time. You're generally better than this.</comment>

<comment>And you're a homophobe</comment>

<comment>Evidence?</comment>

<comment>Oh hi. You get back from beating up another queer? Good for you, buddy.Rest up. You can only beat up a few per day.</comment>

<comment>You're are rude 'little' narcissist, sorry,  I stand corrected.</comment>

<comment>^ its depressing how stupid is the vast portion of the American electorate.</comment>

<comment>Stupid and bigoted.</comment>

<comment>Ironic, you, a homophobe, calling someone else a bigot.</comment>

<comment>You're absolutely correct.</comment>

<comment>Oh, look a Putler - trollski Trump - Troll lovematch.  Get a room you two!  We don't want to watch your repulsive bedroom behavior.</comment>

<comment>The Fries smell strong on this one.</comment>

<comment>All you have to do is show his base that Trump is just using them and doesn't care:- His illegal labor force- His tax plan which gives even more tax cuts to the wealthy- His failed businessesRubio was on point for a sec last night, he might be getting it.</comment>

<comment>White voters don't care about Polish illegals. We love them.His tax plan includes tariffs on imports to companies that NAFTAed American jobs to Mexico.Failing at business doesn't bother his supporters. (How do you lose money on a Casio???)You've got the right idea: he doesn't care about his voters. I just don't think you can break the bond he forged with them over the past six months in a few weeks. What's done is done. The Republican Party is going to be much different from here on out. You thought the obstruction of the last 7 years was bad?</comment>

<comment>Deflection.Protectionism only hurts the US.If he invested in the S&P500, he would be wealthier. Some deal maker.I know, I cannot wait to see this white supremacist construct crumble.</comment>

<comment>All of these things have been debunked, you bigot.</comment>

<comment>None of that even vaguely holds water.</comment>

<comment>It wouldn't, Trump is right, he can do and say whatever but he'll still have his supporters support for reasons of just emotional rage towards government/brown people/etc.</comment>

<comment>True. That black preacher who just spoke clearly hates black people.</comment>

<comment>His ego, Trump's, is one of his few chinks in the armor because it effects his brand.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, fam, that black vote is totally what we should be concerned with!</comment>

<comment>Poor Rubio. None of his attacks, if you can call them that, even landed</comment>

<comment>Rubio wants to cut capital gains tax to 0. Zero. Do you think that will benefit you?</comment>

<comment>Think there's still hope for logic at this late date?</comment>

<comment>Yeah but what about the Wapo freaking out. Their whole staff could turn into another Jonestown.</comment>

<comment>We would all be so sad to see that happen...</comment>

<comment>Go Trumpster.  I love it.  The best entertainment anywhere.  Nothing in Vegas could beat two hours of Trump onstage ---  i.e. on Cruz - "He's like a baby, a little, soft baby. But he's the best liar I've ever seen.I'm still laughing on that line.</comment>

<comment>It's gonna be so cool to see Trump take the nomination......and then take the entire conservative movement with him down the toilet and totally destroy the Republican party.This is like going to a two keg party with giant bongs.</comment>

<comment>Like the Hindenburg crashing into the Titanic.</comment>

<comment>Last nights debate was like watching the Three Stooges and the Marx Brothers rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic.If I had been stoned it wouldn't have been as funny,....</comment>

<comment>It was like Rocky vs ISIS only bloodier.</comment>

<comment>Wow Chris Christie is Sucking up to the Donald. they are made for each other. The scumtard Bromance! I bet Christie wants to be vice prez...to make you not smoke pot. He Hates YOU!</comment>

<comment>Don't sweat the small stuff Canook, I'm sure both of those guys will find a way to get you cheap dope like we already get you cheap pharmaceuticals.</comment>

<comment>Best moment of the debate when Rubio pressed Trump on his Obamacare replacement specifics. Trump had none and kept repeating the same idiotic talking point.The emperor has no clothes. And neither do the court jesters.</comment>

<comment>"I'm going to win, win, win.....in fact; I am going to win so much you will ask me to stop winning.......but wait....there's more.LMFAO</comment>

<comment>You know better than that.It's all about competition.</comment>

<comment>Rubio has no health care plan either. Show me a Republican who does.</comment>

<comment>None of the other GOP candidates have any better ideas.</comment>

<comment>Fox News Election Night Fiasco IISponsored by Trump supporters nationwide.</comment>

<comment>It's gonna be YUGE. Roll out Rove and his marker board. </comment>

<comment>Kind of like when Ohio posted in 2012. Karl Rove's head exploded live on Fox. Priceless</comment>

<comment>Of course I am winning.The other candidates are unelectable.</comment>

<comment>Tautology rocks!!</comment>

<comment>(((Buzzwords)))</comment>

<comment>In other words "What?"</comment>

<comment>Long story short...Trump already won...</comment>

<comment>As the old Hank Thompson song says, you gotta sell those chickens before they die, and the eggs before they hatch.</comment>

<comment>Crubio would let Americans die in the street.  </comment>

<comment>Of course he would, he's GOP.Don't you remember Blitzer's 'gotcha' question, when he rhetorically asked "Should we just let them die?", and the GOP audience cheered?</comment>

<comment>The GOP donors? Yea, they hate poor people. You know that.</comment>

<comment>(((((Sheldon Adelsteinbergblatowitz)))))</comment>

<comment>Which is why I am not voting for Crubio.</comment>

<comment>Trump has been an executive for over 4 decades.  Crubio has no relevant work experience.</comment>

<comment>You've added more substance than any of the people down there thus far.</comment>

<comment>Because we need to help make America great again.</comment>

<comment>Crubio lost the Taco Bell debate.</comment>

<comment>Cruzio is unelectable. Weird how that works.</comment>

<comment>Can't understand how anyone could vote for weasels Cruz or Rubio. With Trump, I think he's a blank slate people project their hopes on. His authoritarian manner gives the poorly educated the sense that he'll take care of all their problems.</comment>

<comment>The only way Trump loses is if Rubio or Hillary cheats. Then there will be riots.</comment>

<comment>Watch out for dirty tricks</comment>

<comment>Of course the long-deceased in Detroit, Camden, Newark, Baton-Rouge, Compton, East Chicago, Cleveland, Flint, Baltimore, Trenton, St. Louis, and Hattiesburg will be voting again just like the did for King O'bongo.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. I don't see any way he loses an election against Hillary Clinton.I couldn't have come up with a better candidate to run against if I had drawn them in a computer.</comment>

<comment>Um, or Hillary could turn out the vote. Not saying there's as much enthusiasm for her as some of her fans think, but she has got a pretty broad support base. </comment>

<comment>ugggh....I hate to say this, but I will #feelthebern before supporting trump.   that's really bad.</comment>

<comment>Okay, Hillary.</comment>

<comment>right.</comment>

<comment>You will feel the burn of that 16" dildo you like to use so much to stretch yourself just right before the fisting guys come over for your standard Rubio foam-party.</comment>

<comment>you're just being sad now.   I mean, gay/sexual deviant jokes that were unprovoked?    The other troll is a lot more clever than you.    You should listen more and type less. You could learn something.</comment>

<comment>Come out of the closet already and stop hating yourself.</comment>

<comment>For the first time in decades, a pro America candidate.Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Self-hating Americans are in a frenzy about what to do.  </comment>

<comment>I love the extremely butthurt minorities on this board."But but but he's racist!"</comment>

<comment>Actually, "he's literally Adolf Hitler!"</comment>

<comment>I demand a DNA test!</comment>

<comment>I love watching the mainstream media finally figuring out what a lot of understood the day last June (July?) when he declared he was going to take defending our borders seriously: that this guy might not win the gay vote or the black vote or the college professor vote, but he's going to more than make up for it everywhere else.</comment>

<comment>Hispanics who are actually citizens (born to Hispanic citizens in turn) actually love Trump.</comment>

<comment>ithink will probably kill himself with a 3D-printed single-shot pistol when Trump wins. He might even off his frail NEET self after Bernie doesn't get the nomination because of the DNC super-delegates for Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Trump is empowering all of those people without a voice. An American hero.</comment>

<comment>definitely would be wise to keep records of trump supporters.  It will then be easy to round them up for forced sterilization.</comment>

<comment>75 Hillary Cents have been donated to your paypal account</comment>

<comment>story was cool the first time, now you're on repeat.  troll better next time.</comment>

<comment>Another 75 Cents. Thanks, Shillary!</comment>

<comment>Does Donald pay you in semen, then?</comment>

<comment>Interesting idea for a future career for you.</comment>

<comment>wow, trump supporters.  just wow.  how much time have you spent doing this today?  Is it hard to masturbate and troll at the same time?  Shouldn't you be looking for a job?  Can't live in mom's basement forever...you know.</comment>

<comment>^Liberal hatred</comment>

<comment>Trump supporters are working/middle class. All the basement dwellers are for Bernie.</comment>

<comment>Won't it be funny when Hillary gets the DNC nomination and out of sheer butthurt and rage about the super-delegate process, Bernie supporters vote for Trump in November?</comment>

<comment>Keep projecting, NEET fagg0t.</comment>

<comment>wow.  now you're just getting angry.</comment>

<comment>What a come-back! Wow! That's just classic, classic stuff right there! Nice intellectual reasoning there as well! You done read gud, broski!</comment>

<comment>They are called "Americans"</comment>

<comment>so then we will call them sterilized americans.</comment>

<comment>Most of his supporters already have kids, but if you want to go around sterilizing 50 year olds, have at it.</comment>

<comment>alright, then will gas the voters, and sterilize their kids.  problem solved.</comment>

<comment>Why not ovens?</comment>

<comment>that's after the gassing, duh.</comment>

<comment>Would you like a free helicopter ride in Trump's helicopter?</comment>

<comment>I thought only Bernie was given handouts?</comment>

<comment>Trust me, we'll make sure you're at the head of the queue.</comment>

<comment>I'm not interested in being in a queue for Bernie or trump.  so, nope.</comment>

<comment>Ah, the totalitarian fagg0t side of you comes out. I see you're only for self-determination through the exercise of suffrage if it means that your side wins, but no other views or votes are legitimate! Great hypocrisy, bro, profess it again!</comment>

<comment>I dunno, they're well armed.</comment>

<comment>It would be safer to deport them. Like the Mooslims.</comment>

<comment>So he's leading in the South and the Midwest.  And the Northeast.  With evangelicals and with socially liberal types like himself.  How can he possibly win then?</comment>

<comment>It's a mystery. Clearly he's Satan.</comment>

<comment>I hope he got a good deal for his soul.</comment>

<comment>He lost so many family members within a very short timeframe.I feel bad for him</comment>

<comment>He has broad appeal. He can never win.</comment>

<comment>The only way he can salvage his campaign is to blow off the Republican base and devote himself to wooing Hispanics and blacks.</comment>

<comment>And the Jewish feminist vote.</comment>

<comment>just the transgendered ones</comment>

<comment>I love all the trump rubes hear.  The death throes of the knuckle dragging mouth breathers from the bible belt is entertaining.   They can't stand becoming less relevant.</comment>

<comment>New Hampshire is the Bible Belt?Nevada?</comment>

<comment>His best states are blue states in the Northeast.</comment>

<comment>wherever there are people like you (mouth breathers, bible thumpers, blue collar wastes of life), there are trump supporters and that is the bible belt. </comment>

<comment>True. The backbone of America, white middleclass, is now awful.Poor guy.</comment>

<comment>it's actually changing.  whites are becoming a less dominant majority, soon to be minority within our lifetimes.  Understandly, you and the cleetuses of the world have trouble accepting this.</comment>

<comment>What language are you speaking?</comment>

<comment>is that what you say, when you're stuck?</comment>

<comment>No I'm legitimately curious.Are you retarded?What's it like having down syndrome?</comment>

<comment>I've met cleverer trolls.  you fit in better with younger folk.</comment>

<comment>Likewise. Although right now, you're my favourite.</comment>

<comment>Ah yes, because you are such a tremendous wit! An absolute side-splitting comic talent!</comment>

<comment>We certainly understand. That's why we're finally rediscovering our identity.</comment>

<comment>it's a numbers game.  sorry.  trump may win this time, but 8, 16, 20 years from now?  get used to being the minority the educated elite have been ridiculing all these years.</comment>

<comment>I actually do quite well by myself. I just haven't forgotten where I come from and who I am.</comment>

<comment>neither has anyone else?</comment>

<comment>Not a problem if we do an Eisenhower-era inspired Operation Wetback II, and deport the 11-14 million and their children (can't separate families now, that'd be cruel!) back to Mexico over the next four years.</comment>

<comment>yeah, we'll just find all 11-14 million people all over this gigantic country and send them all back.  I don't see any logistical problems with that at all.</comment>

<comment>I'd like to see your log plan, there, stud.</comment>

<comment>And that's why it hurts the left-liberal hegemony so much. We were not supposed to react and realize this until much later, 10-20 years from now.</comment>

<comment>I know, those damn inferior subhuman blue collar workers... They are really the scum of the earth, doing all those disgusting, badly-paying jobs, taking them away from all those good unemployed illegal aliens, I mean, "undocumented citizens". Everyone should be an awesome HR staffer like you, working in a nice open-plan office with a brand-new MacBook Pro, because that's how you really know you're doing important work, when you're just emailing all day and going to meetings about meetings.</comment>

<comment>now you get it.  We keep you people around to do the crap work.  I.e. you're expendable.</comment>

<comment>Meetings about meetings about meetings if you're really good. Sigh...</comment>

<comment>What have those conservative megachurch pastors ever done for us?</comment>

<comment>Mark Driscoll taught us that women are just penis homes.</comment>

<comment>My favorite part about Trump is watching the self-hating liberals come to terms with the fact that people love this country.</comment>

<comment>Marco Rubio? Your campaign is almost over, buddyTrump 2016</comment>

<comment>derp derp, I love trump.   I don't like specific policy platforms.  And it's totally a good idea to ban muslims from the US.  That won't instigate more terrorism.  Nope.  none at all.   Also,  my favorite book involves this one where this talking serpent convinces this naked couple to eat magic knowledge fruit.....</comment>

<comment>(((Blame the West for Islam)))</comment>

<comment>duh. those idiot folks with their HS diplomas want us to differentiate between different types of mooslems, but I know better.  Jesus said so.</comment>

<comment>You're my favourite troll.</comment>

<comment>After Tuesday it will all be over.</comment>

<comment>Hopefully not literally. I have such plans. </comment>

<comment>you're a fucking brit?  wtf?</comment>

<comment>Scary, right?</comment>

<comment>Stockholm syndrome I guess, then.   You guys have been are puppet on a string for quite some time.   Special friendship?  yeah, your country is our protectorate state in Europe.</comment>

<comment>Lol. Not European.</comment>

<comment>no one but a limey little b   tch would misspell favorite as favourite.  At least not anyone who loves 'merica</comment>

<comment>What's your favourite colour?</comment>

<comment>seven</comment>

<comment>And you're some American SJW SWPL dildo, right? How's that Hillary lookin' to you right now? Must really ache to have to swallow that hag and her megalomania...</comment>

<comment>actually, reading an article by Christina Hoff Sommers right now.  Is she an SJW?     I don't even know what an SWPL is, but I'm sorry about your dildo.Not breathing through your mouth and not  dragging your knuckles =/= Hillary supporter.I generally don't vote.  But Trump is awful.</comment>

<comment>What's wrong with him?Seriously. As a candidate.What's wrong with his views?</comment>

<comment>are you joking?</comment>

<comment>Serious.Strong borders.Anti Muslim migration.Anti-intervention.Stop right there, and he's the best candidate</comment>

<comment>building a wall?   Mexicans have airplanes and boats.Anti muslim immigration -  not a realistic policy.  has no chance of going through congress or standing up to supreme court scrutinyAnti intervention - are your serious?  saying Iraq and Libya were ill conceived doesn't make you an anti interventionist.   That ship sailed when Rand Paul left the race, not that he had a chance.   Carpet bomb Syria, isis. etc.  Yup, Trump's anti intervention alright.</comment>

<comment>If the Mexicans had boats and planes, they wouldn't be leaving Mexico, you moron.Anti-Muslim Immigration is completely constitutional. And yes, vehemently anti-intervention</comment>

<comment>wow ok.  no planes or boats in mexico.  right.  The constitution means whatever people want it to mean, regardless of what's right or wrong, and there's no way that in this country the supreme court would ever find a blanket policy banning a certain type of immigrant based on religion constitutional.  sorry dude.Again, he said he would bomb the crap out of Isis, and send troops into Syria to take care of the rest.  That's intervention.</comment>

<comment>Yea? Letting Putin handle Isis is intervention?And if the cowards fleeing Mexico had planes and boats, they wouldn't be fleeing.And once again, it's constitutional.</comment>

<comment>saying it's constitutional without any supporting evidence merely an arg by assertion as this point.Bombing the shit out of isis is letting Putin handle it?WSJ and WAPO etc estimate that 1/4 immigrants are illegal, and 40% of those are people who overstayed visas.  I.e. the crossed the border legally.</comment>

<comment>I'm aware. We're going to round them up and deport them.Letting Putin handle ISIS is the way to go. Which is what he advocates.And finally, I love how constitutional it is to ban Muslims.</comment>

<comment>I think you can be more obnoxious </comment>

<comment>also, bring on the unskilled immigrants.  They push labor costs down which make people like me richer.</comment>

<comment>Your welfare check doesn't make you rich.</comment>

<comment>No. My W2 does</comment>

<comment>How is a religious test constitutional?</comment>

<comment>Tests for immigration have been around since the writing of the constitution. Luckily, religion is a criterion we can use.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure a big argument about religious tests for immigration in the colonies is a big part of the reason the First Amendment was written.</comment>

<comment>The first amendment doesn't apply in this case though.</comment>

<comment>"Mexicans have airplanes and boats." Then why do they walk across the desert and die?</comment>

<comment>Boats aren't so handy for crossing into Arizona</comment>

<comment>Why don't you ban terrorists instead of Muslims. And back away from torturing folks. Cuz I like the non intervention bit.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that we aren't sure how radicalization works. The two in California were pretty well assimilated.The Tsarnaev brother who is going to be executed, went to a party after he set off the bomb in Boston. If we don't know how radicalization works, what do we do? I think it's an immigration issue for now.</comment>

<comment>What about converts to Islam?</comment>

<comment>Echo alert, echo alert!</comment>

<comment>I stopped voting Democrat because I could no longer belong to the party that hates America.</comment>

<comment>He's going in on the media again.</comment>

<comment>He should.  I love it when he calls out those liars who masquerade as journalists.</comment>

<comment>You and I both switched parties because of Trump</comment>

<comment>A lot of people did.</comment>

<comment>You too, right?</comment>

<comment>No doubt. I never vote in primaries but I'm gonna selfie this one.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a true patriot who speaks for the backbone of America.</comment>

<comment>I somehow doubt that you ever voted Democrat. I do, however, applaud you for a truly excellent screen-name. "Deus ex iguana" works on so many levels.</comment>

<comment>He's a troll.</comment>

<comment>And you're a homophobe</comment>

<comment>Behave Sayain.  Do not piss me off again.</comment>

<comment>And if I do?</comment>

<comment>You know.</comment>

<comment>He's virulently homophobic. This is just who he isNasty guy</comment>

<comment>A troll in your world is someone who disagrees with you.</comment>

<comment>I would swear on the Bible if I were not an athiest.</comment>

<comment>After Obama was elected he continued doing what Bush had been doing. The same lefties who had been wailing and screaming for 8 years suddenly did a complete 180 defending O for the exact same things W had done.That's when I realized (R) and (D) were irrelevant. The rhetoric changes but the results are the same.</comment>

<comment>Democrats only care about the party and power.</comment>

<comment>Trump won't win. His followers are unwashed hicks who would be better off dead. Thread over.</comment>

<comment>The homophobe speaks again.Hey little guy!You get done beating up a queer today?</comment>

<comment>Thread over has a meaning amigo.</comment>

<comment>So does homophobia.Maybe you should quit with that.It's 2016, ese.</comment>

<comment>Cut him some slack Don, he and his band of special snowflakes rarely venture out of their little safe space, echo chambers anymore.Just imagine the amount of courage it takes for someone like them to hear or read views that dissent from their own.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry. I like bashing the guy. He is vehemently anti-white. He's very homophobic, and he's very anti-America.It's funny</comment>

<comment>Does it bother you that people with post-graduate degrees and high six-figure salaries are also eagerly lining up behind the Trump? How butthurt will you be if he wins the election? Will you leave and go back to Mexico? Your tears will definitely be many and delicious!</comment>

<comment>He hates this country so much, but in Mexico he would be found without a head in the desert.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You're literally on welfare.</comment>

<comment>It's ok to be mad. But good news! Trump will clean up this mess that the Dems have made of this country.</comment>

<comment>You've been wrong about Trump up to this point, why stop now ?</comment>

<comment>He's wrong about everything, but that won't stop his BS</comment>

<comment>So many flavors in the world and you choose bitter.We'll make America great again for you too.</comment>

<comment>Just tired of looking at the current shitstain for the last 7 years, that's all</comment>

<comment>He is going to win.</comment>

<comment>That's what wrong with you little tawts.  If anyone does not agree with your views, they are unwashed hick.   The people who talk about tolerance don't show any tolerance.</comment>

<comment>I stopped reading when there was a talking snake convincing naked people to eat magic fruit.</comment>

<comment>And, what was up with those Adam & Eve belly buttons?</comment>

<comment>And, hmmm.. so original peeps Adam & Eve bore 2 sons, Cain and Abel. Cain murdered his brother, and then (Genesis 4:17) got HIS "wife" pregnant, who bore son Enoch...Where did wifey come from?</comment>

<comment>Genesis 3:20, "And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the mother of all living."this doesn't leave a lot of options for Cain.  Either his sister or his mom....</comment>

<comment>Lilith.</comment>

<comment>Gensis 5:4 ....adam and even begat sons AND daughters...</comment>

<comment>Nephilim. Keep going.</comment>

<comment>Magic fruit has that effect on you, though. Doesn't undermine the credibility of the storyline in that case. ;)</comment>

<comment>Maybe it was really magic fungi. As in shrooms.</comment>

<comment>This is where ol' commie Russell was wrong. We know from the records of the Roman governmental records for the province of Judea that a person of that name was condemned to death following the Judaic custom. Even non-believers don't dispute that unless they are absolute morons.</comment>

<comment>There's no governmental documents of Jesus' existence. That's totally false on your part. There was however a Roman historian named Tacitus who spoke of the execution of "Christus" in Judea. However, Tacitus himself was not a contemporary of the historical Jesus. However, it is true that nearly all scholars accept that there was a historical Jesus.</comment>

<comment>Gosh, you're uneducated.</comment>

<comment>So as I stated to you last week, if any candidate attacks your guy on substance it's over for him. Trump was a bumbling idiot in the last debate when asked to go beyond sloganeering by Rubio. What a loser. He's the stupid person's candidate which explains why you like him.</comment>

<comment>You were wrong last week also.</comment>

<comment>You can't stump the Trump! Trump 2016. </comment>

<comment>Daddy didn't wuv widdle white supremacist Louis Marchalko so he needs big, strong Daddy Twump to hold his widdle hand.Fascist fool.</comment>

<comment>Ya like "Foam Party Rubio"? http://tinyurl.com/jt6lb4r</comment>

<comment>This rally in Oklahoma is absolutely amazing. He just keeps getting better! Is that even possible?Seriously.Watch it:http://www.mediaite.com/online...</comment>

<comment>Just blasted the environmental horseshit lol</comment>

<comment>"My people don't leave me. My people don't leave me."</comment>

<comment>"I'm supposed to say I'm not angry..."hahaha</comment>

<comment>He went off about the air conditioning company moving its factory out of Indianapolis to Mexico. It's still going to sell those air conditioners in the US.</comment>
