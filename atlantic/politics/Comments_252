<comment>How come the Atlantic is ignoring the Dem party's rigged super-delegate system, which makes the actual popular vote into a useless joke?Right now - Hillary and Bernie are about the same in regular delegates - but with superdelegates Hillary is dwarfing Bernie 505 to 71.There is nothing democratic about the Democrat party - only the Republican party is democratic.</comment>

<comment>Is the impulse to channel Joe McCarthy irresistible?</comment>

<comment>Yup.   Dems learned their lesson (I hope) from past debacles and have indeed rigged the system to make it more likely that a party favorite will win over a popular favorite the party dislikes.Not very democratic indeed, but definitely consistent with the notion of a political party.</comment>

<comment>spud's point is valid, but you're absolutely right -- primaries are held by parties, and they get to run them so that the party benefits.  Citizens get to vote in the general election, but there is really no reason that a party has to provide a purely democratic means of determining its candidate.  If people don't like the results the system produces, they can vote against the candidate in the the election.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, sure - similarly, if you don't want to vote for Kim Jong Un in the North Korean election, I am sure there is a space for a write-in.</comment>

<comment>Yes, because the US with a choice on a ballot is exactly the same as a communist dictatorship.</comment>

<comment>Not with the US - only with the Democrat party.</comment>

<comment>Oddly enough, practically every other democracy on the planet runs by people electing candidates chosen by parties.</comment>

<comment>Having fake elections is even odder.</comment>

<comment>Primaries aren't elections.  That's why they're not called "elections".</comment>

<comment>Just a suggestion, dude. Learn English first  -  give English lessons, second.pri·ma·ryˈprīˌmerē,ˈprīm(ə)rē/Submitadjective....noun1.a preliminary election to appoint delegates to a party conference or to select the candidates for a principal, especially presidential, election.2.a primary color.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, spud -- I was indeed incorrect definitionally.</comment>

<comment>Technically true, but as I was explaining to my buddy, its like rigging the playoffs.  You prevent the most capable team from winning in favor of your chosen team.  Their opponents, who went through a robust playoff are likely a stronger team.  The people who own stock in the party just want to make sure that the winner is somebody they own.  If HRC loses or Rubio loses, well, the difference is very small to Merril Lynch and McDonnel Douglass.  It is, however, very large to the people who are actually care about the party.  This is how Sanders came about.  I'm not sanguine about Sanders, but if all the other people have been scared off (again), I guess I'll take him. And we're seeing a 74-year-old who sounds like Judd Hirsch in a tight primary because HRC just ISN'T A GOOD POLITICIAN.  If she makes it to the general, the D's will have a serious problem because they've let a rigged system nominate a weak candidate.The people who own HRC... meh, they won't worry as much.  Trump is pretty business friendly. They hope.</comment>

<comment>Or, alternatively, the party that is deciding on its candidate wants a candidate that is dedicated to the party.  Again, the primaries are party affairs -- it's the process they use to pick the candidate that they will put forward for election.  We may think the process is "undemocratic" in some fashion, but then so is the whole primary system (with staggered votes, and different rules in different states, and the need for vast amounts of money to even compete, among other reasons).</comment>

<comment>The GOP is almost certainly envious of the super-delegate scheme right about now.</comment>

<comment>They might be implementing a super-delegate system after this year.</comment>

<comment>What percentage of total delegates are super-delegates?</comment>

<comment>It varies, but in the Nevada caucus, less than half the total delegates from the state were actually awarded based on the caucus.  A slight majority of delegates are either "super" or "at-large" delegates, neither of which are awarded based on primary results.Both systems attempt to give party insideas the ability to put their thumbs on the scale.  The Democratic version seems to be more effective in this regard.</comment>

<comment>I may be wrong, but my understanding is that the number of super-delegates is relatively small (certainly not a majority). There's a fixed number of super-delegates (712), meaning that more than 4000 delegates of the 4763 available delegates (~85%) will be chosen by popular vote.</comment>

<comment>As I said, that number includes both super delegates and "at large" delegates.  The number of super delegates may be "only" 15% (still a high number IMO), but at least for Nevada, a very high number of delegates are awarded by means other than the caucus.</comment>

<comment>I just tried to figure it out.  Pledged PLEOs, unpledged PLEOs, left-handed unpledged PLEOs from asymmetrical districts, etc.).  What a mess.  Spuds may be right after all.</comment>

<comment>I just gave you the numbers.</comment>

<comment>Sorry.  Let me type more slowly for you...1.  How many total delegates are available in the entire Democratic primary (not just primaries held to-date)?2.  How many of those delegates are super-delegates?3.  What percentage of Democratic delegates will be chosen by popular vote?</comment>

<comment>What nobody is mentioning is that super-delegates are not obligated to stay with the candidate they're currently backing. Hillary's several-hundred-super-delegate lead could easily be a deficit if Bernie wins a bunch of states on Super Tuesday and super-delegates start to flip. And if he does start winning more primaries, I guarantee that lead is going to be reduced.</comment>

<comment>Clinton also led with the super delegates in 2008 and won the primaries, right?</comment>

<comment>They are not, this article is about the REPUBLICAN party not the Democrat party - did you read the article at all? You might as well be asking "Why is the Atlantic ignoring dolphins". If you want an article that talks about the rigged superdelegate system against Bernie go here:  http://www.theatlantic.com/pol... As it stands, your reading comprehension could use some work</comment>

<comment>"Why is the Atlantic ignoring dolphins"Because they thanked us for the fish, and left.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but that post hardly goes to the extent about the Democrat rigging that this one does about the Republicans.  It is mentioned, but glossed over when you consider Hillary was handed a sixth of the delegates needed to win before the actual voting even started.</comment>

<comment>Once you win these delegates, they're yours.  Superdelegates are fluid until the convention.  So its less of a concern.  They aren't some sort of star chamber. They are people, many of whom are political operators or otherwise in the public space. They are susceptible to pressure and if one person is the clear winner, they change their commitment.  See Also: Obama.</comment>

<comment>Thats because that isnt the main focus of the article...  it is a part of the article which looks at a wider question, while the main focus of this article IS about that.</comment>

<comment>Its a black thing.</comment>

<comment>Do you mean like the super-delegates?</comment>

<comment>Almost like Ted doesn't have a chance...</comment>

<comment>Scared by a real conservative, eh?Cruz for President 2014 and 2020</comment>

<comment>Also, the voters should be required to write down their 2nd and 3rd choices. When you have 5 candidates that have the same platform and 1 that doesn't, the oddball will win with 30% even though the majority voted against them.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>That would never fly with the Republicans.  I'm showing my age here, but I remember what happened to Lani Guinier.http://archive.fairvote.org/re...</comment>

<comment>Just another irony in this baffling election season that that Texas chart looks like a big ol' Texas twister leaning across the landscape ... because tornado is as good a metaphor for the chaos in the Republican primary this year as anything.</comment>

<comment>Hmm. That actually doesn't seem that impenetrable to me.  Complicated?  Meh. A little.  1)If you get over 50%, Winner, Winner, Chicken Dinner. Take All2)Less than 50 but more than 20.  You get some.3)Less than 20.  Go home Kasich/Huckabee/Bush, we don't do small potatoes in Texas!Of course, once you've played German boardgames, you get used to FAR more rules than this.</comment>

<comment>"Yes, Marco, i know you have what look like a lot of cities, but none of them are actually completed, whereas Donald here actually has several cloisters, and all these roads, and a lot of farmers..."</comment>

<comment>The real danger as things now stand is if Trump and Clinton promptly wrap everything up, which would leave about eight months with nothing but methane-like emissions escaping an army of nervous pundits.</comment>

<comment>Methane like emissions... Good one.</comment>

<comment>My biggest disappointment when I got my Canadian citizenship was when I figured out that my vote does not matter. I lived in an area that voted strongly with the Conservatives for more than 30 years by a big margin. There is no meaning to the popular vote. In order to have an impact one needs to live in a swing state.When I came to California and got the US citizenship I was already disappointed and it did not matter much. I already knew how the system works.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, in Canada the government has promised electoral reform to deal precisely with that issue.</comment>

<comment>And considering that reform might cost the Liberals in the future, that's saying something.</comment>

<comment>The Trump Train has left the station and it won't stop until it gets to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue after making a victory lap of America. Donald Trump is the only candidate in either party who is not owned by the special interests of the left and of the right. He represents America's silent majority of decent men and women. </comment>
