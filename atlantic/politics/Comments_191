<comment>Back in the Dark Ages when I went to college, I loved the dining hall. All you can eat! And I wasn't the only one. our "freshman fifteen" club was pretty big!</comment>

<comment>I'm not even that old but I loved going to the dining hall... best place to be in the world if you have a hangover or the munchies</comment>

<comment>The food at my university, UMass, Amherst was quite varied and fairly good--also all you can eat.  I was there 1966-70 when the tuition for all four years remained at 200.00 dollars a years--yes, you heard me right, 200 a year!!  But hold your breath, at the same time CUNY was free tuition--yes Lord, I say it again--FREE tuition.Things be changed now!  Instead of complaining about microaggressions and other megastupidities these college pupils today should complain about the REAL OUTRAGE in their lives--college tuition (and don't forget the scandal of textbook costs)--two things these pupils today are unaccountably passive about.Strange world today.</comment>

<comment>"these college pupils today should complain about the REAL OUTRAGE in their lives--college tuition"Bingo. College administrators *love* food protests because it distracts from the real issue. Today's students, however, don't see the bill for their tuition. Either they have scholarships, or more likely student loans and it's all taken care of electronically, or their parents pay. So their tuition rates are completely unknown to them.</comment>

<comment>This is especially true at filthy rich schools like Harvard, where practically every undergrad student is on some sort of grant.  the same for the grad schools there as well.</comment>

<comment>They are complaining about college tuition, and they get called lazy freeloaders by Boomers for doing so.</comment>

<comment>Not evident from the articles I've been reading about all this microaggression insipidity.  But I know there are general complaints about the high cost.  Anyway, I appreciate your correction.</comment>

<comment>Colleges and universities seem to have become places of taxpayer funded and student loan (again taxpayer supported) "Disneylands" as ways to get kids out of the house?</comment>

<comment>Glen, did you actually go to college?I went to Mizzou.  Activism there is nothing new.  In 2003 our big fight was for LGBT people to be included in the university's non-discrimination policy, and we won that fight. (Even in the face of a state legislature threatening to kill federal funding for the university.)College is hard work, and students should demand that university administrators address problems when a school environment has become hostile.  (Even more so when you're paying the tuition costs that these kids are paying for their education.) When a university president is ignoring crimes against students that have been reported to the police, they should lose their job.I don't agree with everything that the current student body is fighting for (and in fact, I hate the elements of their politics that are in direct opposition to free speech) but I'm glad they're not content to be ignored when other students are creating a hostile environment for them.I do agree that the issue of funding needs to be addressed, as student loans have become a bubble.  We all know what happens when a bubble goes 'pop'.</comment>

<comment>"When a university president is ignoring crimes against students that have been reported to the police,..."This, of course, appears to have happened nowhere at all.If anything, it's the reverse. Rape crisis feminists actively discourage women students from reporting rape and sexual assault to the police. This leaves rapists on the streets. Where's your outrage?</comment>

<comment>A real question, Jack, not an attack--where is the source for your observation about the feminist (you mean radical feminists I think) discouraging women from reporting?  An interesting notion but could you expand on that a bit and perhaps offer a source?  I'm no fan of the radfems in universities myself.</comment>

<comment>"When a university president is ignoring crimes against students that have been reported to the police, they should lose their job."Please share with me an example of this happening (a university president ignoring crimes) so that I can be appropriately outraged.Didn't happen any place as far as I can tell.The problem is that this lunatic fringe on campus has convinced itself not only that unfriendly or non approved speech ought to be a crime, but that it IS a crime.  They also expect DRAMATIC action even when there's nothing to act upon.  Assume the president at Mizzou had treated each incident with the seriousness that some one normally treats a murder.  Assume YOU are in charge.  What's the correct way to even assess whether something happened, much less who did it?The only people at Mizzou or elsewhere who have been caught in racist rants, using violence and harassment against others, and so on have been the wackjob activists.</comment>

<comment>The most obvious example is the feces swastika, which Tim Wolfe admitted he'd ignored. (Which is especially egregious in light of the fact that the victim confronted him in person and still couldn't be heard.)  The police report's online if you want to read it yourself, but that was only the highest profile incident.Contrast that against the actions of the University of Oklahoma president who shut down the SAE chapter that posted a racist video on the Internet. He still has his job.All he had to do was listen and take steps to create a more inclusive environment and condemn the actual whack jobs. For the money he was making, and the huge money these students are paying, there's no reason why they should be ignored by university administration.I do agree that some of the demands made by student activists are patently absurd (particularly the ones directed toward free speech rights), but their demand that the university work to end the hostile environment other students have created is not one of them.You must have missed the whole thing about racist conservatives making death threats after the hunger strike at Mizzou started. Two people were arrested for threatening terrorism.</comment>

<comment>"The most obvious example is the feces swastika, which Tim Wolfe admitted he'd ignored. (Which is especially egregious in light of the fact that the victim confronted him in person and still couldn't be heard.) The police report's online if you want to read it yourself, but that was only the highest profile incident."I'm sorry, but according to that report, the incident was in the hands of both the police and multiple school officials within hours of it occurring, and was followed up on multiple times within days of the incident.So what, exactly was the president supposed to do about it?  Report it to the police that already knew?  Report it to various Jewish and other ethnic/racial group representatives on campus?  Report it to the Title IX office for compliance?  It was all already done.  Police had followed up on both this incident and a report of an earlier, possibly related incident of some one saying "nigga" (yes, really, police had to investigate that) in the previous week.When you say he "ignored" it the implication is that he failed to do something that he should have done.  So what should he have done that would have made his response appropriate?http://thefederalist.com/2015/...One thing that's clear is that there IS a very weird racial environment, at least within that dorm, but it also seems as if a lot of that is being manufactured deliberately by administrators and students who then turn around and use it as evidence of victimization.</comment>

<comment>And perhaps also that dorm was reacting to the oppressive demands of these protestors.  there are two sides to all of that.  thumbs up.</comment>

<comment>Those counter actions appeared only after the whack jobs started ranting about microaggressions and firing people left and right, demanding censorship and so on.  Be fair now.</comment>

<comment>And not confined to U of Missouri either.  Unhappily!</comment>

<comment>The terms "hostile environment" and "violence" (when discussing speech for the latter) are pretty suspicious, and I'm inclined not to trust any argument that's centered around that.</comment>

<comment>When a student has to go to the police because the university is ignoring their complaints, 'hostile environment' is probably an understatement.</comment>

<comment>you ever think they ignored their complaints because they never bothered to provide any evidence beyond "well, it happened! i said so!"?</comment>

<comment>Read the police report.Contrast President Wolfe's actions against OU's President Boren when SAE posted a racist video online.That's the difference here.</comment>

<comment>there's a difference because those racist turds put a video on the internet (physical evidence). where was the Mizzou students physical evidence?</comment>

<comment>Photographic evidence. (Link.)But that's just one incident.  The university admitted that it ignored numerous reports. Wolfe himself admitted it, in fact.  That's why he lost his job.In 2003, when we were fighting for inclusion, the university worked with us.  They didn't ignore us.  They addressed the needs of the student body and Mizzou staff and, as you'd expect, no national media incidents ensued. </comment>

<comment>he "lost his job" because he succumb to the incessant child like behavior of the student population and the university looking to lose over $1 million on the football game the team planned on sitting out, and he quit.http://thefederalist.com/2015/...is that really something worth publicly character assassinating a man and forcing him from his job over? i think not.</comment>

<comment>I think Wolfe probably lost his job because complaints from staff/etc. about his cuts to graduate health care in particular and a handful of other boneheaded administrative moves which caused a lot of his lower-level support to fall out. Certainly though yes, the football team threatening to not play was the final strike against him.</comment>

<comment>Ya, money has a way of getting people's attention that marching with signs doesn't.</comment>

<comment>You're welcome to your opinion.I'm glad my alma mater is no longer represented by a man who ignores students who are being harassed on campus.</comment>

<comment>thank you for keeping it civil and you are indeed welcome to your opinion as well. that being said, what was he suppose to do about these supposed cases of harassment? the most "damning", if you will, case of harassment came from that sniveling little shit of a student body president and he couldn't even describe the vehicle that supposedly drove by yelling racial slurs at him and all of that aside, if someone drives by me as i am walking and yells "wetback", am I suppose to just internally break down and then call the police demanding justice? no thanks, i'll take them for the racists idiots they are and ignore them knowing with full affirmation i'm a better person</comment>

<comment>There are many things he could have and should have done.Ignoring the problem was not one of them.</comment>

<comment>at least we both agree on that. thanks for the actual intelligent engagement. it's getting rarer and rarer around these boards.</comment>

<comment>Sure thing.I've seen a lot of folks making the same arguments, but I think if we think a little and look at how other schools have handled the problem, it's very easy to see how Wolfe could have done a better job to confront the problem.</comment>

<comment>you're right. do you think any of the things you suggested would have been enough to curb the rising tide of dislike for the man? i'm skeptical but maybe if he had done it right away instead of waiting too long. who knows</comment>

<comment>Hard to say, really.I think they'd have helped in the beginning, but the situation became impossible to manage.  Mizzou's had activists working for many causes for as long as I can remember, and nothing's ever exploded like this situation did.</comment>

<comment>I was speaking a bit more broadly about the term, but...It was a poop swastika. And it was reported, as mentioned. What was Wolfe supposed to do, exactly? A REALLY strong email? This is why he had to step down? I get the sense Wolfe left because of his generally bad administrative role and cuts to health care making a lot of his support amongst the staff fall out - the poop swastika incident (which, by the way, got casted as an anti-black action despite being, y'know, a swastika) felt like a way to get him out, to me. I don't see this as comparable to the racist chanting in the slightest.The incident was also mixed in amidst a bunch of nonsense about "whites only" frat parties that never actually happened and a complete moral panic about the KKK invading Mizzou which spread amongst even the class president based on a handful of tweets.</comment>

<comment>If only for PR, there are many things he could have done.He could have released a video on social media affirming his commitment to an inclusive student environment.  He could have met officially with student leaders to hear about their experiences.  He could work with university police to determine what had been reported and formulate a plan to act on the reports they'd received.Instead... he did absolutely nothing.  He thought ignoring the problem would make it go away, and that's no way to run a major university.</comment>

<comment>that's a fair critique and you're right, he could have at least done the political dog and pony but when you have one side with their numero uno demand being "admit your white privilege", how can you even begin to take them seriously?</comment>

<comment>That occurred after he'd decided he was simply going to ignore them, and in making the decision to ignore the problem (as he admitted to), he gave them evidence that their critique was accurate.</comment>

<comment>Disagree with you Blog that the student groups have a hostile environment at the universities.  Mumbo jumbo, let's face it.  Utter nonsense.  you seem to agree in part.  I think I need a safe space myself away from this insipidity for awhile.  Ha ha.</comment>

<comment>"taxpayer funded"Don't make me laugh.</comment>

<comment>It did make me laugh, then I realized he was serious, and I got more than a little depressed at the brazen ignorance.</comment>

<comment>He didn't say the country of the origin of the taxpayers he was referring to.  His statement is true if you include wealthy (tax paying) foreign nationals.</comment>

<comment>Chinese, Muslims, etc.  At least the Chinese behave themselves.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't matter. The article is about US universities. The level of taxpayer funding of US universities varies by state, of course, but it's around 34% in total. North Dakota is on the low end, at about .8%. Most states have been in steady decline since 1980, and at current downward trends most will reach 0% within abotu 20 years.</comment>

<comment>My comment was meant as a tongue-in-cheek commentary on our lack of financing of colleges and universities.</comment>

<comment>Ah. My apologies.</comment>

<comment>My apologies for an unclear initial post. :)</comment>

<comment>Good description.</comment>

<comment>Much to be said for that observation.  Take a google earth trip down the streets of most American university campuses and you see sports palaces, skating rinks, a huge physical plant like Disneyland.  That's one of the reasons the tuition is so high.  Also too many people employed there doing too little.  I'm a retired university professor of 35 years.  I must admit the universities in this country are too extravagant and much of that has to do with government grants and loans.</comment>

<comment>Whoaa. Did Conor just say that not only didn't whites get exactly what they wanted but they were forced to pay a steep price for their actions.  Thank goodness the kids aren't at college because this article needs a trigger warning!</comment>

<comment>Most kids in today's colleges are inept to deal with the real world.  Administrators have coddled them into becoming soft, incapable people that will be on welfare roles for most of their life.  College has become for many a real waste of money that leaves these folks saddled with debt and little skills applicable to today's economy and job seekers.</comment>

<comment>Administrators have coddled them? Try helicopter parents, who had them for their first 18 years. I doubt administrators are doing much of anything to change their personalities and skills.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it all comes down to not mistreating children enough. Beat 'em harder is the solution to everything.</comment>

<comment>Uh, welfare rolls. Well, the ones who become Hollywood actors may play welfare roles, but most won't.Lists of people are called "rolls," which derives from "roll call." The term "roll call" comes from the military practice of calling the names of those expected present to find out who's not present. Way back then, the names were written in scrolls, which officers rolled as they read through them -- thus "roll call."</comment>

<comment>Far out, man!  Some worlds are realer than others? Whoa... You really blew my mind!</comment>

<comment>Wait until you find out why the Navy calls it the "head".</comment>

<comment>Tell me all about it, after I pump out.</comment>

<comment>Were they served by slaves?  Was this part of their "honor" culture?</comment>

<comment>How do you figure?</comment>

<comment>A pre-Civil War institution in South Carolina... I'm going to make a wild guess that they used slave labor.  What that has to do with the point of the article I have no idea.</comment>

<comment>Biscuit rebellion. Are you kidding me? If that's all they had to rebel about it's a wonder  those who rebelled graduated with any common sense at all.</comment>

<comment>See:Above post by this writer..............................</comment>

<comment>An article about white men?  I thought we were officially in the dog house now.  Must have slipped past the Mag editors.  Tee-hee!</comment>

<comment>Try this for a much more modern ''rebellion''............http://www.thedailybeast.com/a...</comment>

<comment>"For better and worse, today’s administrators are more inclined to indulge and even celebrate “a spirit of rebellion” in students. (Vietnam War protestors (sic) of bygone eras sit on boards of trustees today.)"Vietnam has nothing to do with it. Declining state support for public institutions means that colleges have to market themselves and compete for students. They do so by offering more services, by making life as generally easy as possible, and by making students think that they're "customers" who are always right.And if the author thinks that "in loco parentis" is anything other than alive and well, he's got no idea how a university operates.</comment>

<comment>Like Conor, I'm tempted to roll my eyes at the seemingly trivial complaints today's students have on their campuses.  But I'm not sure these 150 year old examples do much to convince anyone of their triviality.  Just because the institutional food on campus today is far better and healthier than that of pre-Industrial Revolution campus food (duh) doesn't mean the students aren't allowed to complain. It would be like saying "when I was in college, I actually had to do term paper research in the library without the Internet because it didn't yet exist."  Students today would hear that and stare blankly, wondering what the point is, shake their heads and say, "wow, you poor thing."Yup.  Life was tough back in the 1800s. It was even tougher than today in the 1980's.   But with fewer life-threatening food issues and no civil war to deal with in this century, college kids are focused on societal problems.  I can't say I always agree with the battles they pick, but I'm glad they're in a position to question what they believe are injustices.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Someone 150 years ago could also have told the students, "Wormy biscuits? That's your problem? Listen, when I was your age..."</comment>

<comment>No one in any era is going to defend today's rich kids getting butthurt at $10 / hour cafeteria workers who couldn't figure out how to properly navigate the 'cultural appropriation' maze of the contemporary hipster.</comment>

<comment>Nothing changes. A letter home from a college student to a parent, in the 1200s. Bacchus was the god of wine and partying, Ceres was the goddess of fertility, Apollo of music. So, the kid needs money for wine, sex, and music.B. to his venerable master A., greeting This is to inform you that I am studying at Oxford with the greatest diligence, but the matter of money stands greatly in the way of my promotion, as it is now two months since I spent the last of what you sent me. The city is expensive and makes many demands; I have to rent lodgings, buy necessaries, and provide for many other things which I cannot now specify. Wherefore I respectfully beg your paternity that by the promptings of divine pity you may assist me, so that I may be able to complete what I have well begun. For you must know that without Ceres and Bacchus Apollo grows cold.</comment>

<comment>i think he meant apollo as a god of knowledge.  the saying was venus (love) grows cold without bacchus and ceres, so he substituted apollo.  He can't learn without the funds for reveling.</comment>

<comment>If those Oberlin students think their cafeteria food is their most concern, then they are the most fortunate students in the whole world</comment>

<comment>"The college had even built a brick wall around campus" - Too bad Trump didn't built it, it might have worked.  "Although college authorities praised the bursary, students did not, and ... demanded that the trustees abolish the compulsory requirement." - The original Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>Biscuit Lives Matter?</comment>

<comment>I wonder if Oberlin students would be willing to leave school en masse to advance their cause.  After all if their cause were not such petty nonsense, a little self-sacrifice might be worth it.</comment>

<comment>"“Students were required to eat at the campus dining facility, which frequently served wormy biscuits and rancid meat.”Yes, but was it AUTHENTICALLY wormy and rancid food?  Or was it just appropriated from some rancid, worm infested place, but then served with a vegetable or beverage that not all worm ridden food eaters would have been served in their native place?</comment>

<comment>Hopefully those were free-range worms, not factory farmed.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure if those 19th-century students had had to choose between eating wormy biscuits or seeing "I-A" on their draft cards and thus heading to Vietnam for a couple years, they'd be asking for more biscuits.</comment>

<comment>Actually - Most of these 19th century students died fighting for the confederacy just a few years after this protest.</comment>

<comment>Where they would also get hardtack full of weevils and badly cured salt-pork</comment>

<comment>When I went to college, we had 1 cafeteria and about 3 choices of entree.  We all looked upon them "with a jaundiced eye."  And I'm not ancient!  Things have gotten good at universities!  They're living (and eating) luxuriously.  And yet the students complain more now than ever.  Go figure.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, they're paying a s*** ton more than you did.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they are.  On the other hand, when I was in college, salaries in general were s***, and products at the supermarket were super cheap.  :)</comment>

<comment>Just to be clear, they aren't "maybe" paying more than you did.They're definitely paying a LOT more than you did (this is figurative, of course. I don't know what you paid, but I can get some numbers on what previous generations have paid).... and if you think that isn't at the heart of these very real issues they're bringing up, you're mistaken.</comment>

<comment>Maybe people need to study something else.  I hear welders are making 6-figures nowadays.</comment>

<comment>Bad (false) example to use with me. I know about 200 welders in one of the largest naval port cities in the world who would love to know they're making about $60k too little.</comment>

<comment>Maybe your 200 welders are in the wrong place, or are just awful at their job, or being ripped off.Here you go:http://www.wsj.com/articles/th...</comment>

<comment>for one, that's a paid article which I can't read.for two, it wouldn't even be an article if that weren't an exception to the rule.Like I said, you have an example from a paper. I have 200+ (as I know the market in the surrounding area quite well also) examples from my life.</comment>

<comment>Well, I know someone who is currently studying welding because he researched it and there are some great career offers for welders, since welders are few.</comment>

<comment>Of course, when young people protest over very real and valid concerns, such as war or wealth concentration, they are also contemptuously dismissed.For such a young nation, America sure is a country full of old farts.</comment>

<comment>Crying wolf will do that.</comment>

<comment>60s radicals protesting the draft are (mostly) honored in our history.Occupy Wall Street hipsters, who created a den of filth where rape was rampant in order to express their anger that some people were rich but do so without articulating any policy prescriptions...not so much.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, but the term "draft dodger" is still one helluva pejorative.</comment>

<comment>I'm honestly perplexed as to why they couldn't just make better biscuits.  How hard would it have been to store the damn flour properly, or at least sift it?</comment>

<comment>low bidder 'wins'  the contract.In this case, unpaid, so made money by skimping on the food budget.This was  common in many 19thC dining arrangements</comment>

<comment>is the Atlantic seriously trying to compare people being pissed off about being fed rancid meat and biscuits with worms in it to a bunch of spoiled shits complaining their sushi wasn't "authentic" enough? christ, i've heard of jumping the shark but this takes the cake</comment>

<comment>I am pretty sure he was mocking the spoiled shits, pointing out just how pathetically privileged they are. That is how i read it.</comment>

<comment>Might as well bring on the armageddon if one cannot complain about food, but no surprise that a supposed libertarian blogger would deny others the right to democratic protest.</comment>

<comment>Where in this article does he propose denying the right of protest to anyone?</comment>

<comment>This is but one in a series of his blogs on this topic, all have been condescending and questioned the legitimacy of students' protests.  It is also core to libertarian thinking that rights are not for other people.</comment>

<comment>Being condescending and questioning the legitimacy of the protests is not the same as attempts to deny them those rights. I find the protesters to be shallow and self absorbed, but that doesn't mean that I believe that they should have their First Amendment rights curtailed.</comment>

<comment>It is absolutely the same.  Were he a legislator or part of the executive of any government, the blogging would take a different form altogether.  Aiding and abetting is a crime.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. What you want is the infantile actions of the protesters to be free from criticism.Aiding and abetting? What are you even talking about? Aiding and abetting only refers to helping criminal enterprises. It doesn't apply to making fun of idiots.</comment>

<comment>"What you want is the infantile actions of the protesters to be free from criticism."What I want (and I think I can cut in here, as I've been making a similar argument to QFAs for 5 articles now) is for Conor to let the marketplace of ideas at the school handle this themselves instead of, on at least 5 occasions now, sticking his nose into something that has absolutely nothing to do with him and trying to sway public opinion with his public persona. Did you read the first response in his article about responses from Oberlin? There's legitimate issues underlying all of this and Conor's on his personal vendetta to smear and smear and smear these kids. It's frankly getting a little bit sad how much of his time he's dedicated to shaming a bunch of kids who are simply speaking their minds.</comment>

<comment>Connor is part of "the marketplace of ideas", as are the rest of us commenting in the public sphere. If the overly sheltered cry babies can't handle the critiques of their arguments, maybe they should look at what they are arguing for instead of blaming others for showing how misguided and shallow their demands are.</comment>

<comment>he's not a part of the localized marketplace of ideas at the school.what f'ing say should HE have as to what these kids want to eat for lunch? THEY'RE paying tuition. Conor is not. To me, that gives them infinite more value in that particular marketplace than Conor has.He's been complaining about people using their free speech for 5 articles now. Who's the one being PC again?</comment>

<comment>Your argument is silly. Should the New York Times opinion columnists only opine on issues directly involving them?By the way, he isn't complaining about them using free speech. He is exposing the shallowness of their arguments.</comment>

<comment>He's talking about kids asking for better food! How does that "directly involve him?"</comment>

<comment>Uh, you need to reread what I said again.</comment>

<comment>And was he not satisfied writing 4 articles about them, he had to write 5?Like I said, it's getting sad at this point, but people who jerk off over "anti-PC" outrage love s*** like this..... so they keep clicking.... and clicking....  and clicking.....</comment>

<comment>and again, go read the first reply in that other blog entry.These are real issues the school is handling, and frankly, I've started wondering where Conor comes in....</comment>

<comment>They aren't "real" issues, and the demands are utter claptrap beyond the food service issues. Many are contradictory, and others would utterly destroy what is left of what is hoped to be a liberal education at the institution.</comment>

<comment>"It is also core to libertarian thinking that rights are not for other people."That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever read.</comment>

<comment>It is a regular feature of conor's blogs and indeed many others professing a libertarian outlook.  The basic intent of libertarians is to freeze out any class or group not already at the top of the pile, thus this blogger's regular pieces against any group asserting their right to freedoms others enjoy.  Individual rights are only for the privileged few in the libertarian book.Are you the same Robert1111 who believes the UN is a conspiracy against the US ?</comment>

<comment>The entire outlook of Libertarians is to respect rights of everyone because it is only on the basis of mutually respected rights that our claim to rights have legitimacy.  It is the epitome of "live and let live".The UN is just fine...</comment>

<comment>I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of the food in my university's dining hall,  but I'm also not really going to blame the people making it for its low quality. As someone who's worked in food service, there's only so much you can do to serve to hundreds of people day in and day out.</comment>

<comment>I, for one, will click on any article that makes fun of the Oberlin brats. Keep them coming Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>fake story</comment>

<comment>Most school dining halls today are supplied by companies  like Sysco, that supply to corporate cafeterias, prisons, etc. Like it or not its pretty hard to escape the ubiquitous mass-food system in America. Lo and behold when these students (the current complainers) leave college to find themselves in the real world...eating the same crap. (I stayed away from it then I stay away from it now)</comment>

<comment>Prices for college when colleges served rancid meat and wormy biscuits was affordable.Prices for college now give college students PLENTY of room to complain about whatever the f*** they want without big-time national writers sticking their noses in the students' business.Conor's vendetta against these kids is getting to be pretty sad.</comment>

<comment>I recall standing in the cafeteria line at International House, Berkeley, when the guy in line ahead said, "I wonder what nationality the meatballs are today."</comment>
