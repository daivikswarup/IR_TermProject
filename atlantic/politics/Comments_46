<comment>We don't care if you represent Christian Values, We care you hate the right people#Evangelicals</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I don't see how the "evangelical" group is actually demonstrating Christ-like virtues -- they instead seem to be garden-variety right-wing populists whose political views aren't really influenced by their religion.</comment>

<comment>They are actually rejecting Christian Values by opposing immigration.http://www.coistine.ie/resourc...Change Egypt to America and note hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>Trump stopped into a Presbyterian church service in Iowa and was told this by the minister. Asked afterword, he said the she probably was aiming it at him.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>I like this minister.</comment>

<comment>actually there are no christian virtues, they reject god and appropriate jewish virtues as their own ............yet still 100% of humanity rejects islam, the cult of murderers and thieves</comment>

<comment>Last I saw, at least 23% of humanity disagrees with you.</comment>

<comment>Depends who you talk to today.  There are plenty of evangelicals who take the Gospel seriously.  Lots of the old style 19th century social justice movement had its roots in older evangelical denominations, especially Methodism.  There was always the condemnation happy bunch who sort of ignored the Gospels in favor of Paul's theology.  They were terrified of the Catholics then, of the Muslims now.One thing that has always puzzled me is if their message is so obviously wonderful, why would they care if the opposition got to talk too?  So what?  After they've had their say, everyone ought to flock to them.  Instead they act as if the slightest mention of Islam would send everyone facing east.  I don't get it.</comment>

<comment>nearly 100% of human beings want muslims deported</comment>

<comment>Nearly 100% of not terrible people want trash like you deported.We are as likely to get our wish as you.</comment>

<comment>There are over a billion Muslims, a billion Hindus, a billion Chinese and only  350 million Americans, I'll let you calculate how many Americans are actual Christians sooooooo -  who the heck are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>I said human beings, not muslims, christians, hindus or any other false cult</comment>

<comment>You see the same elite/populist divide in Catholicism. The elites, empowered by a radical Pope Francis, are taking Catholicism to a place where the people who actually sit in the pews are not comfortable going.</comment>

<comment>The people in the pews are more liberal than the hierarchy on average.  White Catholics, as a group are more liberal than White Protestants, especially White Evangelicals.  Most of us are very uncomfortable with the recent alliance with consevatives, especially those of us who know the history of the church in America.</comment>

<comment>The White Catholic- Religious Right  alliance is over thirty years old. Is anything further back than that actually relevant to today's politics?</comment>

<comment>Ever hear of the pope as anti-Christ? Familiar with the term "Reformation"? The alliance you mention is the religious version of the Hitler-Stalin Pact. (Google the terms you are unfamiliar with.)</comment>

<comment>What m w said.  There are a number of evangelical leaders TODAY who go around spouting the old nonsense.  The pograms of the 1840s and 1850s were motivated by real racism.  Catholic children were taught that the pope was the anti-Christ in public schools, hence the rise of parochial schools.  We are bound for eternal torment according to them.  No, I don't trust the Falwells of the world as far as I could throw old fat Jerry.  </comment>

<comment>Depends on what people in the pews you mean.  In the US, people who sit in the pews use birth control, so I don't think they are typically all that conservative.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I'm guessing the Amish don't use most modern methods of birth control.</comment>

<comment>This is actually something I wonder about.  I was watching a documentary a few years ago where the host was talking about the changes in Amish life over the last few decades.  One of the observations was that they were "limiting family size".  I immediately turned to my wife and asked "how are they going about that?"Maybe an Amish person on here will jump in and explain it?</comment>

<comment>People in the pews literally means just that: the people who consistently attend Mass on Sunday's and Holy Days. Using birth control and thinking it is morally wrong to do so are two different things. All Christians will fall short of perfect discipleship, hence the necessity of Reconciliation. But family planning is a relatively minor Catholic-only  issue, not really worth bickering about compared to abortion, euthanasia, and SSM.</comment>

<comment>What, family planning is a "relatively minor" issue?  How so?  It it involves directly contravening God's will that every sex act be open to the gift of life, and it is an issue that involves direct sin by the participant, unlike opposing or favoring government policies around same-sex marriage.(And while we're on sex, 86% of American Catholics believe pre-marital sex is OK.  Again, I don't know how one can pass this off as a "minor" issue, when it goes to the heart of Catholic teaching on the role of sex in human life.)</comment>

<comment>The Catholic Church hierarchy was strongly opposed to making contraception legal in the US and fought it as hard as they could.</comment>

<comment>So you have any evidence for this? A poll?</comment>

<comment>"Their views are more nuanced, and their rhetoric is less bombastic than evangelical populists."In other words, I can make a buck under the right circumstances when I say I'm evangelical. Just don't want to be seen as one of those crazies by my fellow businessmen who aren't evangelical.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is hardly a significantly different alternative to Trump. Any disagreement between Trumpites and Cruzistas is one of style, not substance. Besides that, plenty of the "rabble" love the quintessential Tea Partier from Texas too. The co-pilot and the pilot in this race are far-right darlings. There are no moderates in the cockpit.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is radically different in the characteristic that should presumably matter most to evangelicals, which is religious commitment.  Cruz is a genuine religious conservative, whereas the multiply-married casino impresario who mangles Biblical references and has been pro-choice is hardly a conventional religious conservative, much less evangelical.</comment>

<comment>Not so loud, Donald -- Jerry Falwell Jr. might hear you!</comment>

<comment>Not really. Cruz is the personally unappealing embodiment of the conservative movement's intellectual infrastructure. He believes all the right things, channels the id's energy, and everyone who has to actually work with him hates him so much they want him to fail and/or die horribly. Trump believes very little of what the movement's intellectuals advocate (he's pro-eminent domain, for crying out loud!); both of his appeal and his challenge to the movement is found in that he is a genius at electrifying the id and channeling it into action.</comment>

<comment> is one of style, not substance.It could only be style given the lack of the later.</comment>

<comment>Golly, that was both extremely amusing and completely relevant to the topic of the article.  Good job!</comment>

<comment>They don't make trolls like they used to.</comment>

<comment>That is Pat, a troll of many screen names.</comment>

<comment>Trump:“I turn down so much money,” he lamented. “I feel so foolish. My whole life, I take. Greedy. I take. I take! Greedy! Greedy! Now I’m going to be greedy for the United States. I’m going to take for the United States. I’m going to be so greedy.”What's not to like?</comment>

<comment>Ole Bern is gonna take care of that with his 91% tax on the rich!! LOL</comment>

<comment>Don't quit your day job, or maybe your welfare.</comment>

<comment>Is greed an Evangelical value? What do you think?</comment>

<comment>I don't know, what do you think?</comment>

<comment>Love how the BERN is exposing the leftwing white socialists and the entitlement punked DEMS.</comment>

<comment>Pop or soda? Or do you go for the New England tonic?</comment>

<comment>I drink water. I don't like the fizz of soda.</comment>

<comment>"They are working-class Americans who are pragmatic in their politics."A self-congratulatory delusion of pragmatism does not mean that such politics are, in fact, pragmatic.</comment>

<comment>This article uses some highly loaded terms without definition. Highbrow, (Christianity Today, really?)  and most significantly, "elites." What exactly is an "ordinary evangelical."  I'd like to know how regular their church attendance, for example. I've also read that among (evangelical?)  clergy,  support of Trump is a mere 5 percent. The really interesting question is, were people's political opinions shaped by their religion, or by a variety of other tributaries, which may in the end be far more important to them than religion.  Is everyone who identifies as an evangelical really one? All sorts of religious organizations opposed the war in Iraq, when a majority of Americans thought it was a wonderful idea. Maybe religion is never so potent.</comment>

<comment>Among the adjectives Junior Falwell used to describe Trump was generous.  Was the endorsement cash on the barrel head?</comment>

<comment>So evangelicals are not monolithic?  Whoda thunkit?  Next thing you'll be telling us is that not all Black folks like basketball...or that a some Jews aren't bankers.</comment>

<comment>I always considered myself an evangelical until all the political craziness and decidedly non-Christian hate and judgmental attitudes reared their ugly heads. Suddenly, I was surrounded by evangelical Pharisees. Jesus would never recognize either faction as His followers. A prime example is the variety of ugly attitudes toward immigrants.Matthew 11:28-30 is typical of the actual teachings of Jesus,        "28 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.               29 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.         30 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light."I no longer call myself an evangelical because the current interpretation does NOT include the all-encompassing love of Jesus. Forgiveness, sharing, sacrificial giving - these are all part of the teachings and the behavior of Jesus. Greed, selfishness, huge collections of "stuff" may engender material envy from Americans, but those are not character traits which come from faith in and a relationship with Jesus Christ. We cannot turn away the immigrants, fail to care for the poor, the children, the elderly - i.e. others in need - and sit on our overweight, overfed, overmedicated, and selfish, self-centered rear ends judging our fellow sojourners on the planet and call ourselves followers of Christ.Matthew 6:24 (New International Version)   "No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."</comment>

<comment>The saddest thing to me is that evangelicals have stressed scripture and faith-in-Jesus as their primary touchstones, and yet after decades of pastors preaching these values, evangelicals ran after Donald Trump, someone who objectively does not represent orthodox Christian values with regards to mercy, love, healing, and inclusion.I can't imagine the Jesus of the New Testament saying the things Donald Trump does about women, the poor, gays, minorities, and his enemies.And yet, after all those years of reading and memorizing Bible verses, Evangelicals abandoned the principles of their faith and flocked to Donald as their shepherd.Maybe Evangelicalism has a false basis for its claims of changing people to be more like Jesus.I still consider myself Evangelical because it's my home, but I have really, really questioned the past few years how my brothers and sisters have lost their collective minds.</comment>

<comment>Yes, tribalism is at work in us all, and the oppression of the PC world combined with the erosion of nearly ever collective moral value has caused many to seek relief in the form of a truly horrible man.Two things however are important:1.  They are sophisticated enough to realize they aren't voting for the pope, but for a political leader.  Jimmy Carter was a truly great man, but not a great president.  2.  Those whose view of Christianity is the sermon on the mount exclusively, with little understanding or interest in other parts of scripture probably will never understand the average evangelical.  Inclusion, biblically, only goes so far.</comment>

<comment>I think I hear what you're saying.I don't, for the life of me, as a life-long Evangelical, comprehend how people like the president of Liberty University can endorse a man like Donald Trump, however, and I cannot, for the life of me, understand how my fellow Evangelicals can abandon the principles of Jesus and the teaching of our faith to follow Donald Trump.I get it that we're all fallen humans in the eyes of the teachings of the New Testament. (It's not the same in all religions, but it is a common doctrine in most Christian faiths than humans are fallen.) And when we pick a leader, they will have flaws.I just cannot accept that, given the field of candidates for the office of the presidency, Evangelicals would coalesce around someone who represents the worst qualities of fallen humanity, namely an outright and open hostility to the poor, the weak, the crippled, the oppressed, and the marginalized.I'm not voting for Chief Pastor of the United States. I'd vote for a pagan or atheist or Muslim if they were the best candidate and the opponent was a Christian but completely unqualified to be president.I just don't understand this one. Trump isn't the exemplary Christian as we might think Carter to be. Trump isn't the great Republican like Dole or McCain or Reagan. Trump is, well, a black swan event for Republicans. Evangelicals who support him simply have to abandon their faithfulness to their teaching to do so.</comment>

<comment>I don't disagree.</comment>

<comment>When the very personification of greed and hate is embraced by those who claim to live in the words and works of our Lord, well thats a good a sign of the end times as any.</comment>
