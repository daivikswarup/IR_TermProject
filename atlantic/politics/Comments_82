<comment>I fear Cruz doesn't understand math. How does he plan to add 75,000 soldiers (with training, pay, and benefits, plus medical costs, relocation, etc., and then GI Bill benefits and other VA benefits for them in the future), 77 ships, 12 nuclear subs, and 1,000+ planes, all while cutting federal spending by $500 billion over a decade?</comment>

<comment>"and then GI Bill benefits and other VA benefits for them in the future"These last two will be addressed through speeches with the message 'If you REALLY loved your country, you'd have died for it'</comment>

<comment>And,  lest we fail to point out one of the classic Republican rules of Accountancy,  profligate Defense spending is only valid for contractors and their wares.   Things like Veterans Healthcare,  retirement,  education and disability benefits are someone else's problem.   They suggest running more ads for Wounded Warrior Project and crying that there's no money for the veterans since it was already spent,  you know,  on the welfare Queens of the Defense industry. </comment>

<comment>I suspect the people listening to him understand math even less. As such, it's all good.For my part, not that I actually care, but I simply assume that Cruz is lying his a$$ off. From what I understand, the really strange thing is that people, some segment of them anyways, will actually believe that Cruz is telling them the truth.Which is downright bizarre to me, but there it is.</comment>

<comment>Got that right...</comment>

<comment>It's pretty simple - once you add his 16% VAT to the 77 ships, 12 subs and 1000+ planes, everything is paid for.....  (And, once FICA is eliminated, you don't need to pay old people SS/Medicare, so you easily save $500B a year....)  </comment>

<comment>So, Cruz is going to tell people who have worked and paid into SS for decades that they get nothing in return? I can only hope that's true. Nothing will turn Baby Boomers and retirees against him faster than saying SS was a huge bait-and-switch.</comment>

<comment>Retirement's going away and being replaced by a 401K-type money market account that can't be withdrawn from until you're 65.  The admittedly overgenerous education benefits (I'm going to be getting paid to go to grad school later this year after retirement unless someone screws it up between now and then) are eroding more slowly, but definitely getting scaled back.  Medical coverage is no cheaper and certainly no better than a civilian HMO, and also rising in price.As long as we continue down the road of prioritizing hardware over people, it'll be a cinch to save that much and more while simultaneously upgrading equipment.  Of course, the people operating it will go back to being the modern day equivalent of uneducated peasants--though that seems to be just what a lot of the leaders I deal with want anyway.</comment>

<comment>Well, then he should be prepared to be bombarded with "Cruz hates the military and our veterans!" messages if his answer to my concern is to cut benefits.Though, this really just reinforces my belief that Democrats are the ones who actually are about veterans. They're less likely to send us into war, and more likely to take care of us after the fact.</comment>

<comment>This was pretty much my takeaway. I do think there are some Republicans in office who actually do care about veterans, but that's mostly because they are veterans themselves, and they're growing vanishingly small in number.</comment>

<comment>well you can't count on McCain, as he has denied every thing to make it better for our wounded veterans, he has done everything he can against our returning military survivors.</comment>

<comment>I don't love McCain, but I think he's one of the few GOPs who will take a stand for veterans. Lindsey Graham, too, seems to have half a brain, and is also a vet. Most of the rest of them, it's all lip service.</comment>

<comment>Same as everyone else has:  Credit.</comment>

<comment>Credit doesn't address the issue I raised. I didn't ask how he would pay for it, I asked how he expected to simultaneously spend hundreds of billions, maybe even trillions, of dollars, while also reducing federal spending. Credit is irrelevant in that issue.You can't both spend more and spend less at the same time.</comment>

<comment>Sure you can - you just run up the debt, saying that "deficits don't matter", and then when the Democrats retake the White House, you scream about how they're bankrupting us with their lack of fiscal discipline for not immediately repaying all the debt you ran up.</comment>

<comment>he will give the same old over-used comment that the GOP always uses, tax cuts for the rich. their answer to anything you ask them. but they ignore the outcome of their stupidity.</comment>

<comment>Ronald Reagan did it and thats why the fright-wingers love him so much.  If the apostle Ted gets elected he's gonna  work the same miracle.  PRAISE BE,</comment>

<comment>He wants to get rid of the IRS, Department of Ed, Department of Energy, Department of Commerce, and Department of Housing and Urban Development. He wants halt hiring of bureaucrats, specifically hiring 1 new employee for every 3 that quit/retire. He wants to end all energy subsidies (fossil fuel and clean energy).And as he said, his tax plan will boost the economy. We'll get more money returning home, more investment from the wealthy, and more investment from abroad. That means more money to tax and more revenue acquired in a productive way that helps everybody.</comment>

<comment>hahhahahaa, that's funny, thanks</comment>

<comment>So, what that (hiring one for every three who leave) means is that the remaining employees will have to increase their workloads. One person will be expected to do the work of three.His tax plan won't boost the economy. You must have taken math at the same place he did.</comment>

<comment>On federal employees working harder, good. They are called civil servants yet they get better wages than the average American by about 78% plus benefits and a pension. Federal government work should be as close to slave labor as we have in America. All of their income and benefits come from taxpayers. And DC is now the most expensive place to live in America. They have abused our generosity long enough. They currently do about 1/4 of the work of an average person. Three times as much would still fall short.Every analysis of Ted Cruz's tax plan says it will boost the economy. You're basing your opinions off of your feelings and prejudice.</comment>

<comment>I worked several years with the U.S. Forest Service before moving into private sector consulting. I worked much harder for about 40% less money when I worked for the government. Frankly, I find the private sector quite slow paced compared to my work for the federal government. Now I can't speak for all agencies, but neither can you. Where on earth did your 78% more money for the same job come from? Your 1/4 of the work number? And get this, we did NOT have a pension, we had a TSP-style savings plan with employer support that was terrible compared to the private sector. Many of these jobs require advanced degrees, and you think slave wages are the way to go?</comment>

<comment>78% is average Americans vs. average federal employees, not people with equivalent jobs. It was recently reported that there are now 500,000 federal employees making over $100k per year. And since there are between 2-2.5 million employees, we're talking about 1 in 4 or 5 of them making that kind of cash (funded by the taxpayers of today and tomorrow).1/4 of the work was hyperbole. While I'm glad to hear you were working hard, "lazy government worker" is an often accurate stereotype. I assume I'm quite a bit younger than you (I'm an older millennial)? But all I hear about from people who currently work for the feds is that they do very little work and see massive amounts of waste. Also, doesn't your wage increase reflect your experience? Having worked for the US Forest Service seems like it would look good on a resume, no?The way to go is to start dissolving federal agencies and letting taxpayers keep their earnings. Privatize as much as possible. Slave wages is hyperbole too. But Washington DC should not be the new Beverly Hills.</comment>

<comment>Just FYI - you do realize that a huge chunk of that is in Defense and Law Enforcement/Homeland Security, right?As for "lazy feds" - I used to work for a federal agency (first as a contractor, then as a fed). I saw some people who were worthless, and some who were awesome. The problem was less the ones who were worthless, because you get those in the private sector too (as I've seen firsthand when working for a major corporation), but more that the ones who were awesome didn't stay around, because they got hired away by the private sector for more money, the same or better benefits, and to get treated better. It gets very tiring when you're trying to do your level best, and make a difference for the better, and random people assume you're a sh*tbag because you work for the Department of Whatever. Also, Washington DC is crazy expensive, so good luck even if you do make $100k, when even a townhouse an hour's drive away costs $300-400k+.Myself, I followed that route out of the government - found a better job, doing interesting work, paying better, in a more affordable area, working in the private sector. But we get what we pay for - if we treat government workers like crap, we shouldn't be surprised that crap is what we get.</comment>

<comment>That 500,000 figure does not include military personnel. I'm sure plenty of the 500k are in DHS, but even if the entire DHS made over $100k, there would be hundreds of thousands of others.The gripe with lazy employees in private vs. public sector is that we don't pay for the private employees. If a corporation wants to pay a bad worker, that's the corporation's prerogative. Government workers are employed by us, but we have no say in their employment status. From what I understand, it's very difficult for them to get fired too. Any experience in that aspect of it you can share?The cost of living in DC is driven by the resident's ability to pay. The most expensive suburbs in America are the ones surrounding the White House. That should make taxpayers angry, not bureaucrats.I'm glad you're in the private sector now. I don't always hear better pay, but I always hear better work and more room for creativity.</comment>

<comment>Firewraith did not say military personnel; he said Homeland Security and Defense, by which I presume he means the massive civilian bloat of the DOD.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think the military doesn't have civilians? Go take a look at the Department of Defense. DoD would grind to a halt without them.As for hiring and firing - yes, it's hard to fire a GS employee, but it's really not that much worse than in the private sector in terms of being fired for misconduct or poor performance.  They could certainly do better - but part of the problem that's resulted from pursuing that in turn is the rise of reliance on contractors as FTEs, or Full Time Equivalents, which is basically hiring a private company to act as a staffing firm. But they're pretty much just hiring from the same pool of people, and charging you more for the privilege, because now you're paying for salary + benefits + admin costs + profit for them. That's something that should piss anyone off, because we're paying more for it.For the record, during my year and a half, I was in a group with 7 Feds counting myself. In that time, 1 left to go to another agency (taking a better job), 1 left to take a better job in the same agency (and later moved to the private sector), and 2 others quit rather than risk being fired (which they would likely have been if they'd stayed).And yes, you could just make it easier to fire people in civil service, or even make it at-will, but that has a lot of issues too, not to mention the fact that then you're largely going to be forced to compete directly with the private sector on salary, meaning paying a lot more, at least if you want a snowball's chance in hell of getting halfway competent people.Also, DC cost of living isn't driven by federal employees' salaries, so much as a number of factors including the money that goes into the area, the lack of housing  compared to demand, and the lackluster transportation infrastructure that's perpetually 10-15 years behind what it should be.</comment>

<comment>I see where I was confused in DoD. Thanks for clearing that up.</comment>

<comment>Firing people isn't the herculean task some say it is, but most managers, for a host of reasons, don't.I will say that your best people are often found at the lower levels, rather than the higher.  Being promoted requires the appearance of doing an enormous amount of work for little expenditure, without rocking the boat.  That translates to people not doing the hard jobs, and glossing over actual requirements.</comment>

<comment>Fed pay/workforce size is tough.1) Much of the leadership is ABYSMALLY bad.  They either don't know how to lead, aren't given the authority to, or simply won't2) Those pulling the sled do, genuinely, work their arses off.3) The ratio of sled-pullers to dead weight varies from about 1:1 to 1:2 in the areas I've seen.  Because of point #1, the dead-weight is not shedI donk know how, specifically to fix it, but effective leadership, and 'flatter' org structures would probably double efficiency.</comment>

<comment>I appreciate your analysis. But Cruz (and I) are suggesting less federal government responsibility as the solution. Return power to the states and the people. It's less about reforming the fed, and more about reducing it.</comment>

<comment>I'm actually (largely) in agreement with you (and him).  My issue is with the blanket assertion that we ought to let 3 retire for every one we hire.I want the lead out, but we have to make it such that we enable those who care, and work hard, to succeed.  I'd love a smaller IRS, and I'd love to see us shrink even some sections of DoD.  But to do that WITHOUT fixing the problems we have, we'll just end up shoveling money to contractors to do jobs that actually SHOULD be done in-house.For example: Budget, Cost, and Planning analysis is often shipped out to contractors when there aren't competent Government departments to do that work.  That puts private (hired) individuals in a terrible spot: their job depends on delivering an answer that isn't unpalletable, otherwise they risk losing the work.  This, consciously or otherwise, puts pressure on them to find out what answer the sponsor wants, and then to deliver that, or something close.  A civil servant experiences MUCH less pressure in such a situation, and is at considerably less risk pushing back.</comment>

<comment>I see.What a clusterf*ck!I'm sure it would be more nuanced than hire 1 for every 3 who leave, as would be abolishing the IRS, DEO, and the others. You shoot for the stars in hopes of getting the moon!I'm starting to think Rubio will get the GOP nomination anyway.</comment>

<comment>My concern, which I'm hoping isn't going to happen, is that Trump does OK thru the primaries, loses fair-and-square, makes up some BS conspiracy, and runs 3rd party.He won't get elected that way, but he would almost certainly guarantee a HRC win.  And I have no clue what happens if she wins.  I can tell you that, in my corner, she's almost universally reviled, because this e-mail thing is completely beyond the pale.  You can (and rightly so) be fired for having a spill in your e-mail that you don't report.  Setting up your own server would be unthinkable, and having a spill on that server would be certain dismissal, with prosecution to follow.  I don't know how broadly the attitude goes, but I suspect a huge chunk of DoD/FBI/IC agencies have reacted similarly.It's amazing how much 'narrative' plays into whom people support.  It's also interesting how much shallower that narrative is with the Rs than the Ds right now (in my own opinion).</comment>

<comment>I have the exact same fears about Trump. I still think there's a chance he's sabotaging the GOP for the Democrats. As George Will said almost a year ago, "If Trump wanted to sabotage the GOP for the Clintons, what would he be doing differently?"The other shocking thing about Clinton is the precedent the appeared to be set with General Patraeus. I admit I'm a bit confused about the matter as a whole, but Patraeus' discretions don't appear to be any worse than Clinton's, and he served our country with such honor. What in the world has Clinton ever done for us that she needs this kind of protection?I'm grossed out by this entire election. I'll settle for anyone other than Clinton, Sanders, or Trump. But holy shit... what's gonna happen to our country? It seems like we are descending into mob rule. In "Democracy in America" De Tocqueville spoke about how societies tend to either enslave themselves in order to make the powerful less powerful, or become so equal that they have no power, and an opportunistic tyrant seizes control. I have to say I'm concerned.</comment>

<comment>Federal workers make less than private sector, at least in the professional ranks.</comment>

<comment>The 78% number refers to federal employees vs. private sector workers in general. It's not like private accountant vs. public accountant or something like that.</comment>

<comment>So you're just lying.  The reason for the number you cite would be that there are no government factory workers/servers/etc - actually very few unskilled jobs at all.  I'm sure you could compare the average salary at all law firms against the total population, you'll see even bigger numbers.Maybe you want unqualified hacks to carry out your slave labor, but I'd rather pay a little more for people who are qualified to do their jobs.</comment>

<comment>"They are called civil servants yet they get better wages than the average American by about 78%"Where did I lie? I was very explicit.</comment>

<comment>If you think people with graduate degrees should work for minimum wage or less, good luck.  Comparing apples to chainsaws is meaningless.</comment>

<comment>Which is why it's misleading, because the government doesn't hire many low-wage employees at all. In fact, even most of the janitorial and other services is simply contracted out now (which probably makes sense, as opposed to the hiring of FTEs).In fact, it's partly why it's so hard to get good people, especially in high demand areas like Information Technology/Security. Would you rather work for the government, or would you rather work for Google/Apple/Microsoft/etc? And that's even before we talk about how much less the government will pay you. Is it any surprise that the government can't compete for the best people, and is stuck with who's left?</comment>

<comment>Really? (referring to the Tax Policy Center) Link Link"Cruz tax plan would cost $8.6 trillion, second only to Trump, analysis finds" Link"Ted Cruz's Naive VAT Plan Would Lead Federal Tax Rates To Soar"LinkAlso, you realize federal employees are people, too, right? DC being an expensive place to live isn't because of them--it's because of all the lobbyists, law firms, and government contractors which naturally congregate around the seat of the nation. Cutting the number of government employees, and increasing their workload, won't change that. What it will result in is disgruntled federal workers who are overworked and out of fucks to give, meaning we'll just have shittier interactions with the federal government. And, right or wrong, when the federal government is dysfunctional, who gets the blame? The President, largely. And, in this scenario, that would be the hypothetical Pres. Cruz. And the Republican-controlled Senate and House will also take their share of the beatings for it.</comment>

<comment>Unless those analyses are taking into account the economic growth Cruz's plans are projected to have, you're talking apples and oranges. Do they? Or are they just talking about a finite economy? If they aren't considering economic growth and invest thanks to deregulation and friendlier taxation, what you've posted is irrelevant.You're also missing the entire point of what Cruz wants to do. He wants less reliance upon the federal government and more intimacy within the states, communities, families, and individuals. The idea is to get the federal government out of our lives so we can get back to self-governance. You're creating a false dichotomy of happy federal workers vs. unhappy federal workers. How about less federal government?I obviously realize they are people. But I'd rather see them in the private or local government sector. Everyone I've conversed with in this post says life is better outside of federal government employment. I'd like more people to come to that realization.</comment>

<comment>You're creating the false dichotomy of more vs less government. We could have the same amount of government, but functioning better. That could also account for why people think working in the private sector is so much better--because people like you are holding down their pay, and increasing their workloads. If I couldn't get a raise, but had an increasing workload, I'd be unhappy, too.I worked for the federal government before, albeit as a military service member, not as a civilian.And yes, at least some of those links I posted judged his plan on both a static and dynamic basis. I can't say for sure that they all did, as I don't remember anymore, but you clearly didn't bother to even read them, or else you would know the answer to your own question.</comment>

<comment>First off, thank you for your service.I am not creating a false dichotomy. I'm just explaining the concept behind Cruz's policies. His aim is to lower taxes, reduce spending, and boost the economy in a big way. If you don't look at it without considering the option of trimming the fat in the public sector and ripening the economy for economic growth, then Cruz's plan can't make sense.I don't agree with your assertion that taxpayers are holding federal workers down because you have to consider the fact that we'd like to keep our own money and take care of ourselves at the state/local level. I think federal workers are holding the rest of us down in many areas, particularly in the EPA, both DOEs, and some others. The private sector creates its own wealth and is free to experiment. The public sector takes money from people and is extremely rigid and dull.I've reached my limit for WSJ articles this month, but the others you posted only discuss Cruz's tax plan with no spending cuts or consideration of a boosted economy. They mostly say things like "we'd need spending cuts", which Cruz is all about.I think it's fair to believe that Cruz's play won't work and the economy will not improve, but from what I've been reading, I'm convinced that it will and support him. Anyway, Cruz is shooting for the stars in his campaign. He'd only accomplish some of his goals as president.</comment>

<comment>I agree that there are some problems with the federal government, both in terms of wasteful spending, and in terms of overreaching regulations.But, all of those agencies you just listed do a lot of good, too. The private sector piggybacks on the infrastructure and investments of the government. The internet that we're using to discuss (Disqus) right now? A DoD project. Some people are able to be net energy producers, with solar panels that were at least partially funded by government grants and loans. Not that our literacy rate is perfect, by any means, but the reason most of this country can read and write is due to public schooling.Sometimes, the private sector experiments and creates its own wealth by dumping waste into rivers, or burying it in the ground, for "free," rather than paying someone to properly store or dispose of it. The EPA prevents that. Yes, it costs the companies, and, ultimately, us, more money. But it's a lot cheaper than ending up with, say, cancer. The problem many people have is that it's easy to see the expense--taxes, fees, etc., but it's hard to see the benefit derived. You can look at an income statement and see how much firm X paid in waste disposal taxes and fees, but there's nowhere to look, no line item, to see how much the nation saved by forcing firm X to properly dispose of its waste, rather than dumping it. If allowed to dump, the firm would be privatizing the savings in foregone fees, but socializing the costs of contaminated land and/or water, and of the later cleanup. We, the taxpayers, would be subsidizing the firm, by allowing ourselves to pay for the cleanup, rather than either making the firm pay for the proper disposal in the first place, or the cleanup after the fact.Where I live, I don't really see the police that much. But I pay for them, indirectly, through my taxes. But just because I don't see them doesn't mean I'm not deriving any benefit from them. I also don't see or hear about much crime where I live. We could figure out how much of my rent goes to taxes, and what portion of the taxes goes to the police, and so we could say that I pay x dollars per year in taxes. But how much is the low crime worth? I don't know, because it's a lot harder to quantify, and, to some extent, it's a qualitative attribute, not really measurable.Also, austerity measures don't fix the economy. Look at Greece. Several states have been cutting taxes for several years now, and stagnating teachers' pay. On paper, it may look good, but they have teacher crises in many of those states, where experienced teachers are fleeing, and no new ones are coming in because they can't afford to make so little money. It's shortsighted. To put it colloquially, it's being penny wise and pound foolish. Energy, education, the environment--these are all investments which will pay dividends in the future. But, if you're so concerned about not spending any money on them now--seeing them, instead of as investments, as cost centers--then there will be no dividends in the future from them.Reasonable people can disagree about which investments are worthwhile, whether a given investment is, how much regulation is too much, and whether a given regulation makes sense. But it's hard to argue that investments, in general, are bad, or that regulations, which allow the market to function, are bad. They're never going to be perfect, but nothing ever will be. But don't let perfect be the enemy of the good. On the whole, we enjoy a net benefit from all the taxes and regulations we have. Sure, there will be some losers, as there always are (e.g., the company which can't turn a profit if it has to pay to dispose of its waste), but, overall, we're better off.</comment>

<comment>Neither Ted Cruz nor myself are talking about cutting the DoD. First off, it's authorized by the Constitution. Secondly, it is the most vital and basic purpose for having a government and a country in the first place. The military is one of few areas of government that undoubtedly makes our lives better by keeping us safe, and, as you mentioned, innovating. Computers themselves are a result of military spending as is NASA and everything they've come up with. Ted Cruz actually wants us to go to the moon.When it comes to the private sector damaging the environment, it's certainly true that that happens and there should be a mechanism for preventing and addressing it. Ted Cruz obviously agrees because while he has spoken about limiting the EPA, he has not come close to suggesting we abolish it. But there are many people who believe the EPA has become ideological rather than responsible and that they are killing jobs and industry far more than they are protecting the environment. Marco Rubio called them the "employment prevention agency" which I found pretty funny. I'm not sure what their role was, but Obama vetoed the Keystone Pipeline despite the science which claimed it would not be a threat to the environment. From an economics and humanitarian standpoint, it is also undeniable that environmental regulations hurt the people who need the most help. Cutting carbon emissions doesn't bother rich people who already have cars and enough money to adapt to changes, but the poor who need to be gritty to advance in life suffer when options are taken away from them. The result is a third world that can't develop when environmental regulations are on an international scale. The Paris Climate Agreement is great for people in the Hollywood hills and DC, but not for the rest of us. I think that's immoral and anti-American. I could go on and on about this. The ban on DDT (which occurred despite scientific evidence it was not a threat) has caused millions of deaths from disease around the globe and prevented agricultural development and wealth creation because families have to spend their money on healthcare instead of saving and climbing the ladder.When it comes to police, that's all state taxes, right? I have no desire to tell states other than mine what to do. That's the beauty of the 10th Amendment. If the citizens of a state want to spend more money to enhance their safety, they can elect officials to appease them. If other states have more of a "give me Liberty or give me death" attitude, they can design their states correspondingly. I think getting more Constitutional and more local (as opposed to more Socialist and Statist) would solve a lot of our problems, especially when it comes to happiness and fulfillment in life. And that is certainly a Ted Cruz agenda.Per the Constitution, education should be a state and We the People issue (as should energy). I agree that public education helps a lot of us read, but our current education system is not something to be proud of. The unions and bureaucrats ruin everything. They get in the way of voucher programs and charter schools to protect their salaries. It's just too big. Localizing is the answer. The only response people have to that is "what if the parents teach creationism instead of evolution!". The problem with our country is that people are allowed to get involved in the private lives of families this much. It's killing our country. We are literally descending into mob rule.I'm a teacher myself, but I'm teaching abroad. There is no way I'll go back home to work for a union in our public school system. I'm finishing my MEd now, and will either get a job at a private school in the states, or stay abroad where I am appreciated and able to actually teach. The school system I'm in is horrendous, but one unintended consequence of that is that I don't have to deal with administration cramming curriculum down my throat. I get to diagnose my students' needs, and address their weaknesses. I'm having the time of my life and actually making a difference in the lives of children. I could use some more money, but I couldn't be happier. lolGreece is not a fair example. That's a trainwreck on so many levels. If anything, they prove that the welfare state causes poverty and the disintegration of work ethic and character. No matter how Greece behaved, Germany and the other productive nations paid for their needs. That's inhumane and destructive. Germany is one of these places that should preach what they practice. A fiscally Conservative and well-to-do wonderland that refuses to judge the behavior of others and might be destroying the world thanks to their political correctness.We can certainly disagree, but since our government is bigger than it's ever been outside of WWII, I don't think it's unreasonable to start talking about scaling things back. I'm not proposing anarchy, but at least getting closer to our Constitutional Republic.</comment>

<comment>So let's starve the civilian side of things in favor of the military? I doubt that is what the military actually wants, especially after the Iraq war where the military had to take on civilian roles better suited to state, usaid, etc. Because civilian agencies didn't have the people/resources.</comment>

<comment>The civilian side works despite of not because of the government. The EPA and IRS are an albatross around the next of business due to onerous regulations.</comment>

<comment>Growth over environment sure seemed to work well for the PRC.</comment>

<comment>Nothing in China isn't following exactly the normal Industrial Revolution pattern. People care about the environment only when they aren't starving.</comment>

<comment>And your point is what, that their environment is currently not f@#@ed? That we should just ignore the environment for the economy like that is some good bargain?</comment>

<comment>It's massively better. People who are healthy and wealthy care about the environment. Greens push things that hurt the environment by lowering standards of living. Look at the organic food scam. It causes deforestation.</comment>

<comment>Because it's so easy to fix once you start caring about it? What's good for business is not de facto what is good for society. </comment>

<comment>Things are fixed easily. London fog ( really coal smog) is long gone, water is cleaner and there are trees in America in places that had been completely deforested a century ago. </comment>

<comment>Cutting top tax rates does not boost the economy.  That's the "supply-side" theory, aka "trickle down".  It does not encourage investment.  It encourages businesses to run up profits by cutting worker pay.  The whole race to the bottom for workers to the benefit of companies harms the economy, 70% of which is based on consumer spending.High top tax rates encourage businesses to invest profits back into the company, either through worker wages or expansion.  Lower tax rates in the lower brackets do give workers more to spend.  With much higher numbers of workers  - when they earn higher wages and pay lower taxes - they demand things, and supply will be created to meet that demand.</comment>

<comment>I think that's the conclusion people came up with after the Bush tax cuts, but there were so many other variables to account for and it was very short term. If you convince job creators that America is a good place for business, they will invest here.  A low, flat tax and low corporate tax rate is a good selling point.And I fully agree when it comes to lowering taxes on the middle and lower class.</comment>

<comment>The conclusion comes from farther back than Bush.  The whole theory makes no sense.  But its implementation (yes, it is still in place) is resulting in transferring the little wealth held at the worker level to those "job creators".  When there is eventually no demand, and especially no demand growth, there's no reason to build supply regardless of tax rates.</comment>

<comment>I don't think it's fair to use that explanation at the moment because people who would like to create demand are unable to start businesses. The permits, licensing, and regulation in the US are out of control. I can't imagine how many good ideas vanish into thin air thanks to how hard it is to be entrepreneurial. I guess a lot of  that is at the state level? But Cruz talks about deregulating too.</comment>

<comment>That's not true at all.</comment>

<comment>Be nice if he added the wildly corrupt ATF to the chopping block.</comment>

<comment>Why would the jobs come back when labor in Asia is 1.25 per day. You want to do that</comment>

<comment>You're fucking with us, right?</comment>

<comment>I don't like spending/raising taxes at all.  But if I had to choose, I'd rather be taxed for improving our military.  Both Bernie and Hillary would tax us to death to pay out to the freeloaders/moochers to have free college and sit at home salaries. </comment>

<comment>"And as he said, his tax plan will boost the economy. "Small wonder Trump is accusing him of being" the biggest liar I ever met!

<comment>Math has never been Rightie's strong subject. Way he saw it, only pointy heads and girls were good at Math.</comment>

<comment>That's why Cruzers hate common core.</comment>

<comment>cruz's tax plan calls for $8.5 tax cuts over 10 years.  truly voodoo math until you realize the obvious ravages he'd do to social programs.</comment>

<comment>Well, until the Republican beneficiaries of these programs realize what's going on. Analysis shows that there are more Republicans than Democrats on welfare. The older Americans on Social Security also tend to lean right. They like to talk about cutting benefits, but they literally can't, because they'll be voted out after the next election if they do.</comment>

<comment>The CrusTed one hates common core.  People might be able to the math.</comment>

<comment>Exactly how Reagan did, borrowing and creating a massive DeficitYeah Republicans!</comment>

<comment>Borrowing doesn't reduce spending. All it does is shift who is making the payments, and when. He'll still increase spending, while reducing revenue.</comment>

<comment>the Teabaggers/Republicans intend to spend no money on medical cost for our wounded soldiers. The GOP has cut or denied every suggested increase to help our veterans. Even Paul Ryan said it was the duty of our returning injured veterans to have died over there so they would not cost any medical in the states. That is they GOP way.</comment>

<comment>The GOP is a double-whammy for veterans: more likely to send people to war, and less likely to actually take care of them afterwards.</comment>

<comment>get with the program.  like every president he will crack down on waste, fraud, and abuse and be as successful as they were</comment>

<comment>Well, if they'd knock off the spending on ridiculous things such as $750,000 on a new soccer field for detainees at Guantanamo Bay, $700,000 to study methane gas emissions from dairy cows, and $25,000,000,000 per year maintaining unused/vacant federal buildings, we might be able to afford all that!</comment>

<comment>To all dumb people : illegal immigrations cost us 100 billion a year . Useless Department of Endoctrinations , EPA , IRS and  about 70% of government bureaucrats - get rid  all of them and we will have plenty of money left to support our military .</comment>

<comment>But if you get rid of the IRS, why is anyone going to pay taxes to support the military?Could you explain that one to me?Thanks!</comment>

<comment>That's easy, you just use cops to squeeze money out of all those lazy poor people that haven't been paying any taxes, because there's where the real cash is.</comment>

<comment>Look ,  I said we have to get rid of IRS .I didn't say we don't need  some kind of tax collection agency .In 1913 income tax code was 15 pages .They told us income tax would never exceed 3% of income . Now it's 30+ thousand pages and so much complicated you have to hire accounting to do your taxes . Using the tax code politician reward their buddies and punish  political opponents  . GE made billions $ profit and paid no taxes . Why ? They in bed with Hussein O Did you have tax exemptions ? Yea , right .</comment>

<comment>Ah yes, the military.  The jobs program that fiscal conservatives will throw unlimited money at.</comment>

<comment>Remember, it's not Big Government if its painted olive drab!</comment>

<comment>So what ? i don't care how much money we have to spend in order  to protect the nations . The world  is far from safe  hippie paradise  with stupid " Imagine " .</comment>

<comment>We already spend 2times more then no 2 country. And what are we getting 1.2 trillion F35 that doesn`t work. billion dollar Naval vessels that break down on maiden voyage.</comment>

<comment>You are wrong . Now we are spending much less . Russia , China , Iran building their military like crazy .Ours is shrinking .Besides there are huge difference in $ spending between USA  and Russia or China .  When russians  or chinise invest  $100 ml  into the military it's not the same $100ml  we do . We would have to spend  1 billion to get the  same result .  For example : salary  Army Lieutenant in Russia is 125 $ monthly . In USA it's about 5 k . So all this talk how we spend 2 or 4 or 10 times more than others country , is a bull crap . The truth is right now we are not spending enough . Do you know we  are having bad bombs shortage ?  Yea , we don't have enough bombs to bomb ISIS ! We ran out of them ! </comment>

<comment>you are so wrong on your information. do you always get all your information from Fox, Rush, Bill-o, Glenn ?</comment>

<comment>Prove I Am wrong .  What ? I can redirect you to russian and chinese website where you can read yourself . Well , I don't think so . Cos you don't read russian . I do . And I know cos I lived over there .  And how many times I have to repeat : I DON'T WATCH BLOODY FOX !</comment>

<comment>How does one collect the $ without an IRS?</comment>

<comment>Do you pay your taxes when taxes are due, or do you pay them when an IRS agent comes to your house with a gun?</comment>

<comment>Then the question is, would you pay if there's no one checking to ensure you pay? I mean, there's no carrots for paying your taxes are there? Thus the stick, even if applied lightly.</comment>

<comment>People in this country are responsible and feel it is their duty to support their nation. People pay taxes out of duty, not out of fear. (Thought I worry about the upcoming generation of radical leftists continuing this tradition... anyway, about 43% of Americans pay nothing in income taxes at this juncture. I believe that number is on the rise.)Do you think there is an IRS equivalent in every country? There is not.</comment>

<comment>it's a good thing you are not old enough to votestop skipping school, child</comment>

<comment>Re: IRS equivalents and their lack in other countries, care to name a country without an equivalent? Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Well, we already have a Treasury Department. The IRS functions as a special agency within that department. Most countries do the same. A handful just have their already established departments handle it. Examples would be Brazil, Czech Republic, and Poland. I don't think any countries spend as much money on their "IRS" equivalent as we do, but I could be wrong.By abolishing the IRS (which is unauthorized under the Constitution unlike the Treasury Department itself), you could just give them the responsibility of collecting taxes without needing a massive agency. And with a flat tax like Cruz supports, paying your taxes would not be a hassle. You'd fill out your taxes on a post card, and keep much more of your money. From the opposite point of view, the Treasury Department would not be tasked with the arduous responsibility of calculating everyone's finances. You just look at their income above the exemption line, and multiply it by 10 or 15.We'd need to get the "ask not what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for your country" mentality back, but it might be a bit of a pipe dream with Trump and Sanders telling everyone the government will take care of them.</comment>

<comment>Wrong every country has a method of collecting taxes. So we are paying on the honor code? Corps don`t pay taxes now, self employed? Hedge fund guys? There is absolutely no thought in what Cruz is saying</comment>

<comment>There will still be a means of collecting taxes. But without the Biblical tax code, you don't need a $12 billion agency to handle it. I think it's highly unlikely he'll literally abolish the IRS, but by simplifying the tax code (he wants it to be simple enough to fill out your taxes on a post card), you can downsize and cut some spending.</comment>

<comment>Good luck getting that through congress. They (both parties) are all bought. I have an idea, why don`t we pay 18%, and capital gains pay 32% Ef the job creaters, they are making them in Asia and Mexico (note Indiana)</comment>

<comment>I ran away to live in a corona commercial with two beautiful women.</comment>

<comment>Listen , of course  it's going to be some agency to collect taxes . But not this IRS Monster we have now . First tax code was 16 pages and they told it's temporary and will never exceed 3% of income . Now it's 30 thousand pages and idiot in White House making it bigger and bigger every year . All his buddies , crony capitalists  enjoying tax exemptions . Are you ?</comment>

<comment>Sure and so are you. Remember all those rules have to originate in the house of representatives so you should try to get your head around the fact that those increased rules come from a repubican majority house.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about ?  From 1931 to 1997 Democrats control Congress all together 58 years . Republicans - 4 years . And now we paying the price for democrats  social experiment  and thousands of regulations which destroyed business in America . So it's you are the one who should try to get your head around .You , libs , really not so bright  are you? That's what they call you "low informations  voters ". I call you - useful idiots .  </comment>

<comment>the military get almost 70 cents of every tax dollar now, we outspend the rest of the world every year on military and we overspend more than 6 times than the other top 7 countries on military and some of those other top spending countries spend less than 5% of their budget on military. we are spending ourselves into bankruptcy on a dying nation. and get rid of the EPA, right now in America over 34% of the people do not have safe drinking water and if it was not for the EPA, that would be much higher now. so you want to spend more for war toys on a nation that has no safe water, poor education, crumbling infrastructure, where workers are all falling behind and cannot afford to live in a nation of over inflated prices on slave wages.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about ? Pentagon budget for 2016 is $ 612 billion which is 54% of GDP . 90% of EPA regulations is leftist crap which is killing american farmers and businesses . And I have lived in many states and NEVER had problem with drinking water .Cut the crap. Most amount of money which has been spend on education is in Chicago . And they give us worst performance .  Slave wages? Get yourself a good working skill . Learn . Businesses looking everywhere for skilled workers who knows the trade . And  they are paid good money .

<comment>DetesTed is a shameless bullshitter. He will tell anyone anything they want to hear.The defense contractors must be loving this little agenda of DetesTed's.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure the contractors don't believe him. I'd like to think they aren't that dumb. I could, of course, be wrong.</comment>

<comment>Do either DetesTed or his audience realize that the Soviet Union destroyed itself by spending itself into bankruptcy on "defense?" Just like DetesTed is proposing.</comment>

<comment>Put the social agenda on a starvation diet, and inject the military with steroids. Those states that live off military spending will love him, our educational system will shrivel down to match some Eastern European State, and for all this we will still get the home grown attacks, and Prez Cruz can get his P.R. jollies meeting body bags.</comment>

<comment>Hey now, the majority of Eastern European states have very good educational systems nowadays. Estonia and Poland, for example.</comment>

<comment>November 2016 will mark the 13th Presidential election in which I will have voted, assuming I live that long. Experience has taught me to mostly ignore what candidates say about defense, for several reasons:* They don't act in a vacuum. There's Congress' machinations to consider, for one, along with NATO and any number of allies, foes, frenemies etc. who have their own agendas, all of which affect the U.S.'s plans and responses. * Political capital, or lack thereof. For example: had Bubba not been mired in his own impeachment hearings he might have green-lit a missile attack on our friend Mr. bin Laden, who was conveniently shacked up with a handful of wives in the middle of the desert in almost plain sight, back before you-know-what. But Congress on his ass post-Monica took the wind out of those cruise missiles' sails. If the next POTUS somehow soils the nest all the military build-up on the planet might not accompany the requisite gonads to actually use it.* Unforeseen events. Economic spasms, guys flying planes into buildings, etc. Things change. Outliers exist. Hell, who knows what's crawling around in Kim's reptilian brain, really? Meanwhile if Ebola figures out how to stay alive indefinitely while airborne, the number of ballistic-missile subs is suddenly irrelevant. Hint: mosquitoes showing up in Moscow is not a good sign. Thanks, fellow fossil-fuel burners!* An under-informed, largely knee-jerk electorate squealing like a Greek chorus on bath salts when stuff happens that they think they understand but actually don't because when you start peeling back those onion layers the tears start flowing. Media fan the flames and there's President Dog being vigorously wagged by his/her own tail.* Bureaucracy. Sometimes I think we should have sixteen or twenty branches of the military because then they could have playoffs, like in professional sports. We could elect a devoutly pacifist Quaker as POTUS and we'd still have multi-gazillion-dollar military-hardware cost overruns lasting decades. Funding the Pentagon is mostly a spectator sport for the average American who's in a tizzy worrying about how much Mexican immigrants are costing his county emergency clinic. Cruz doesn't mention if he has the administrative chops to rule DOD. (I'm inclined to think he doesn't.)So, yeah, Ted, you and your fellow Kabuki dancers can show me who can tinkle higher up the wall, and I'll vote accordingly. Or not.</comment>

<comment>Electing ted 'crazy' cruz would guarantee at least two wars for the US, yet more blood and treasure to spill, all in the name of...jesus.  And this is the absolute worst area on which to spend more money.  The US already spends more than the next nine countries...combined.  The US should be looking to other nations to step up to the plate in spending on military (Japan, Germany etc) and put more emphasis on domestic infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>We don't have enough money to fix our roads or educate our children, but there's always enough money for killing people. The truth is that the military is a big jobs program. If we want to to fund jobs programs, we can find better ways to employ our citizens than war.</comment>

<comment>They are actually more effective in generating jobs than military spending is.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I have flagged you for disguising an advertisement as a comment.</comment>

<comment>The $1.5 trillion figure is the estimated cost of the program over 55 years and includes orders for 3500 F35's. The development cost it split between multiple nations. Please stop pushing this F35 myth/slander</comment>

<comment>Haha. The F35 is universally seen as a boondoggle and pork pie.</comment>

<comment>Only to the media. On a technical level it is an amazing piece of engineering and weapons technology.</comment>

<comment>No.A. It doesn't work. B. It is a hugely expensive piece of pork.</comment>

<comment>Yeah the not working thing seems kind of important when you're spending that much.</comment>

<comment>It's an amazing piece of technology that is expensive and unnecessary. The program is also an excellent example of the inefficiency and lack of accountability that is common in the defense industry. You could even call it a boondoggle.It's a boondoggle because it's not military requirements that are driving these programs, they would get more bang for the buck by maintaining and upgrading current technologies. It's the defense industry that is driving the idea we need a completely new next generation fighter, whatever that means.</comment>

<comment>They need to be smarter. Not bigger.</comment>

<comment>If we were to stop pretending that we're the Eurasian land power that we're not, and stop trying to intervene over there any time something happens that we don't like, then we would be able to cut the army back to little more than the National Guard plus a few specialist units. This in turn would enable us to fund the naval and air procurements that we actually do need for our real national security - and maybe still even be able to realize a net cut to the defense budget. This is what we really need to do, but we won't be doing it - much to our long range harm.</comment>

<comment>we have the largest air force in the world,)USAF)  we also have the secondlargest air force in the world, (us navy), and the largest navy in the worldwhat the hell are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>So he can cut taxes and then claim that all the jobs are created via military spending are a result of the tax cuts.  These guys never hold military spending constant when they cut taxes.</comment>

<comment>so true</comment>

<comment>We actually DO need such large air and naval forces. If we were not able to project power across the oceans, then we would need to massively fortify our coasts, and that still not be enough to secure our territory. And lest you claim that there is no nation that could mount such a threat, I would respond that it is precisely because we DO have such large air and naval forces that they know they need not even bother to try. Eliminate those, and the temptation to at least give us a good punch might become more attractive. USAF and USN are NOT the services that we need to cut.What we DON'T need is a huge land army traipsing around obscure, dusty, but troubled places on the other side of the world. Perhaps we could participate in multi-national forces intervening in various hot spots, especially in providing logistical and intelligence support, but we neither need nor can we afford to be doing this unilaterally. Cut out the neo-imperialist pretensions, redeploy and retrench back to our natural defensive perimeter, and we can cut back the army to little more than the National Guard and a few specialist units, resulting in huge savings in the defense budget. We can and should apply some of those savings to prudent investments in planes and ships, but still realize a net saving.</comment>

<comment>so you are an  isolationist, that's just begging for trouble</comment>

<comment>As opposed to going out and looking it for the past 70 years.For the record, I do think we need to be responsibly engaged in world affairs. However, trouble spots need to be dealt with on an international, multilateral basis. There are things that are the world's responsibility to solve, but that doesn't make them our unilateral responsibility to solve. And by the way, our track record on our unilateral interventions has not exactly been fantastic. The real trouble we've been begging for is the national bankruptcy that comes from overextending ourselves and trying to do everything for everybody, instead of what is actually necessary for ourselves.</comment>

<comment>bankruptcy?? oh, okay, your an idiot, never mind</comment>

<comment>Per-capita national debt to per-capita GDP is now >100% and is rising fast. That should be setting off alarm bells, but just remain blind and deaf and continue heaping verbal abuse upon everyone you disagree with, if that is your preference.</comment>

<comment>you don't know anything about money, kid, how canwe go bankrupt when we print our own money?you are way out of your league when it comes to international finance</comment>

<comment>These ideas are all reasonable. The problem is how to pay for it rather than it not making sense to have. Raise taxes on the wealthy and corporations, reform various parts of our government to save money and free up investment and then build a bigger military.</comment>

<comment>Except even the Navy doesn't want more ships.</comment>

<comment>Why on earth would we need 12 new ballistic missile carrying submarines?</comment>

<comment>the air force has almost as many warplanes as the rest of the world, combinedthe us navy is the second largest air force in the world, how many moreplanes do we need? come on</comment>

<comment>Right wingers sure to love their "tough talk" and playing army.</comment>

<comment>And spending unlimited amounts of money on defense is why every great empire in history is still around today.  What's that, they invariably spent themselves into bankruptcy and were either overthrown by their own unpaid soldiers or were conquered when it turns out spending lots of money only creates a bloated military not a strong one.</comment>

<comment>Of course Cruz and others will spend like no tomorrow on building up the military. It's what they do best, who cares about it being paid for? Must make sure though that any programs that help the poor, unemployed or seniors be paid for!! Republicans have never seen a war that they don't want us to be involved in. Boots on the ground in the thousands just as long as it someone's else's child and none of theirs! It's stunning to me how many in the military vote for Republicans as it is they who send their them off to war at the drop of a hat. Then vets have the nerve to complain that nothing is being done for them. If they were to check Republicans voting record they would find out why and exactly who it is who does nothing for them.....Republicans!  It's about time veteran woke up and smell the coffee.</comment>

<comment>$$$  Blood = Money</comment>

<comment>If we only had a couple more aircraft carriers those San Bernadino jihadis would have thought twice or something.Republicans have gone insane.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure the idea of undermining civilian control of the military will go over too well with the military.  That might play well with the redneck militias who don't like the idea of a Commander in Chief who is a black man but I'd say for the most part the military would like to keep things the way they are.</comment>

<comment>Just plain nuts. We already spend more than the next ten countries combined.</comment>

<comment>Could cut a lot of this by making the Europeans cut their welfare state and actually defend themselves.</comment>

<comment>They don't have to cut their social programs to do more militarily.   But the US has to quit spending money on them.  Our problem isn't that the Europeans,  Israel,  South Korea and Japan LET us spend money on them,  it's that we offer it for free in the first place because we're spending SO MUCH on the military that the cash frenzy spills across the globe. </comment>

<comment>500 Republican economists are going over every detail of Bernie Sanders' platform,  shaking their heads at the taxes he has outlined and free public college,  free universal Healthcare,  family leave and more.   They're wailing that America can't AFFORD to be so generous with its citizens.Meanwhile,  nary a word about Trump's $20 trillion giveaway tax plan for the 1%, or any of the other proposals from Republican candidates all of which heavily favor the wealthiest.  Our national debt is nothing but a memorial to the tax cuts that have enabled the 1% to do fabulously well and sock it away in the Cayman Islands.You can't make this stuff up.   Meanwhile,  Hillary promises to fulfill low expectations,  more of the same,  but promises we'll all feel better when she's in the White House.  They're planning for bigger boats headed for the Caymans.Back in Denver,  right-wing commentators are scratching their heads,  wondering how Bernie Sanders could draw a crowd of 18,000, standing room only,  last weekend.   I think a good number of people are going to be shocked that American voters are waking up and voting for real change,  not chump change. </comment>

<comment>Hillary promises incremental progress that won't break the bank. Its not sexy, but it is more responsible than what Bernie is promising.As for Republicans, don't get me started.</comment>

<comment>"Hillary promises incremental progress that won't break the bank."From the mouths of babes... ROFLMAO!Indeed,  Hillary Clinton arouses no expectation OTHER than the fact that she'll NEVER touch or 'break'  up the banks.  She's on a mission to earn that $15 million the finance industry bribed her with! </comment>

<comment>Break up the banks. That sounds so...I don't know....uninteresting.Break them up into what? A bunch of smaller banks? What is the point now that we have a way to unwind them through Dodd Frank?And by the way, was Obama bribed?</comment>

<comment>We'll need Glass-Steagall.  Hillary's money men said no to that. What's the point in giving her $225,000 if she won't do what they want?And yes, Barack Obama went onboard the yacht and took the promise of money, hired his AG from Wall Street and the rest is history. Read "Confidence Men" for a complete rundown.I'm not doing that again.  I'm going to vote for the guy that didn't get bought by Wall Street and the rest.  Bernie Sanders offers us one thing:  an honest politician.There's no one else.</comment>

<comment>No amount of money spent on the war machine is ever too great for Republicans. You have to laugh at some Republicans when the call themselves fiscal conservatives. There is nothing fiscally responsible about spending more and more on a military that is over bloated already! To hear them speak about how our military is shrinking you would think we only have one plane and one ship left! It's pure scare tactics which works for those who are all for going to war with anyone who even looks at us the wrong way! All the war talk goes down well the warmongers out there who have never seen a war they don't want us to get involved in. Those in the military who are so enamored with Trump better get suited up and booted up because it will be a case of hi ho hi ho it's off to war we go should he ever become POTUS!</comment>

<comment>If it's called "Don't Tax" and spend, then it's all good.  Cause we're not raising taxes, we're just spending.  Because we're broke.  And and and....  The right wing bullshit never seems to confound those too stupid to know they're that stupid.  They just rabidly go along with it if it means "mo guns!"</comment>

<comment>Our country already spends more then the next 8 or 9 countries combined, we don't need to spend more!!!!</comment>

<comment>I just want a candidate who is fiscally responsible and believes the following (and I don’t care what party he/she is with), please add to the list as you see fit.:1.	As new things are added, old things must be divested.  There is a finite amount of taxpayer money, and politicians must work with that amount.  IF you want a bigger well do it through Private Sector JOB CREATION – grow the economy.2.	Entertain seriously some approach to a zero based budgeting: recognize there may be expenses that, though once well intended, need phasing out.3.	Make fraud of government funds a quickly and severely punishable offense, including monies spent on military, welfare, IRS, every single government agency in existence.  Those knowingly abusing the taxpayer’s money – lose their jobs, their pensions, and if not jailed at the very least community service.4.	Take an oath that if you defraud the taxpayer, you lose your job, your  pension, your right to vote, and your right to ever seek public office again.5.	Never, ever send any American off to war in some God forsaken place under the bs guise of national security.  NEVER.6.	Defends the laws of the American constitution, period.  No choosing the ones you like.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, our military budget is already 54% of the total, and bigger than the next 9 nations combined! Sure, we need to expand that...</comment>

<comment>Interesting how all the God-people want such a big military...if God is on their side, what do they need military for at all?</comment>

<comment>The devil made them do it.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is quite the socialist, eh? Then again, he is Canadian.</comment>

<comment>TRUMPy DUMPy is saying the same thing, about how awful and unprepared our military is, despite the fact that it CONsumes more than 50% of federal expenditures. Just where are TRUMPy and CRUZ-boy going to come up with the cash, considering they are both promising massive tax cuts at the same time.</comment>

<comment>He is right, actually, he just frames it terribly, because he doesn't realize WHY he's right. Our resources and our commitments are out of whack, and since we refuse to reduce our commitments - the opposite, really - it's the other side of the equation that we have to address. But you can either do that by piling on more stuff, or by being smarter with the resources you've got. And he wants this stuff to fight who? We're not fighting WWII, where we have to bury Jerry under Shermans and Jeeps; we're fighting low-cost insurgencies. We spent a couple trillion dollars in Iraq, and managed to eke out a draw against people who maybe spent a couple billion. That's not sustainable. Either we stop fighting those sorts of wars (impossible without retreating behind the oceans), or we try to make them more cost-effective, and piling on ballistic missile subs is the opposite of that. AFRICOM is stupid, but at least it's trying to be smart.>Instead he eagerly negotiates with terroristsThese guys desperately, desperately need a Littlefinger in their inner circles https://youtu.be/ggwT_-vlTM8?t...</comment>

<comment>I bet Ted Cruz's "hugely expensive plan" costs far less than Bernie Sanders' "hugely expensive plan."</comment>

<comment>Perhaps, but with Bernie's plan at least the American people get something out of the deal.</comment>

<comment>we spend about 70 cents of every tax dollar now on wars. Cruz will cut S.S., Medicare which is not a part of the tax dollars used for the running of this country, SS and Medicare, along with unemployment are insurance trust funds which do not add to or are a part of the budget, but the GOP starting when Obama became President chose to lie about it and convince the sheeple it is. Tell a lie often enough syndrome. Russia spend itself into bankruptcy not that long ago and America is also. right now 34+% of Americans DO NOT have safe drinking water and that was at the end of last year, we let schools fall apart and close while building more prisons for profit, our students are falling behind and people like Cruz want to make America a Theocracy-he has said it several times-thus taking us back to the Dark Ages in education, our infrastructure is crumbling and while the rest of the world advances, America is continuing to go down. So Ted, just what the hell are we protecting aside from the spoils of war the rich demand be stolen from other nations ? we certainly are not protecting a crumbling nation, no sane country would spend more money to defend a terminal country.</comment>

<comment>Cruz wants to increase work visas by 500% knocking Americans out of jobsDid you know that Ted Cruz voted in favor of Obamacare?"He spent more than 21 straight hours railing against any government funding forObamacare. Then Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas joined the other 99 senatorsfrom both parties in voting Wednesday to move ahead on a spending plan expectedto do just that." Yes, but.... WHAT BUTT?Did you know, that on the Trade Deal Cruz voted NAY on HR 1314 - he voted against an amendment to the Trade Deal that would require congress to be consulted if China (or other nations) were to join after the fact. Directly saying he did not want congress to be consulted before other countries, namely CHINA, could join TPP? Yes, but... WHAT BUTT?Did you know that, In the 114th congress, Charles Schumer and Ted Cruz have voted together on 61 of 339 roll call votes in which neither abstained, representing a voting similarity of 18%. Compromising the conservative platform, giving Obama whatever he needed.Did you know that Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio voted to block further action on a bill that would have enhanced benefits for veterans including guaranteeing in-state tuition rates at all public universities for post-9/11 veterans.For once Marco Rubio told a truth: Ted Cruz is a liar.Why did Ted Cruz gave Obama executive action in Iran?Ted Cruz spoke powerfully, as have most of the GOP presidential candidates, as to the reasons why the Iran deal should never have been agreed to. He listed the reasons why it is so morally objectionable. He articulated the very essence of why theAmerican people know beyond any doubt that it is the single biggest foreign policy mistake made in our lifetimes. He properly communicated why it will be seen historically as worse than Neville Chamberlain upon his return from Munich in 1938.So imagine most Americans' surprise when they learn that Cruz actually voted to do the opposite of what every American wanted done with the deal: make it a treaty, enforceable under real congressional teeth. Americans did not want to let President Obama use his "pen and phone"-style executive order to wield foreign policy insanity.But that's what the senator voted for in May of this year.Yet there also is a Machiavellian element to Cruz’s gambit. Cruz positioned himself in a way so that he would appear pro-legalization if an immigration overhaul passed — or appear anti-legalization if hard-liner stances became more acceptable. We wonder how Cruz would frame his 2013 public statements now if an immigration bill hadpassed both houses of Congress and enjoyed popular support.Everything Cruz performed in the Senate for years was only an act that will convince "stupid" voters to think he was and is a hero of the conservative cause.A lawyer, like you, his performance was totally aimed at the jury. Setting up the stage for his future presidential campaign.</comment>

<comment>it WAS NOT 21 straight hours, he took a break about 45 minutes into is bogus and not legitimate filibuster. rules of a filibuster are that once you take a break, it is over. well it used to be until the Teabaggers decided to make their own rules up on everything.</comment>

<comment>Two Presidents of the United States with personal experience in LEADING our armed forces, v a Republican that's trying to scam the Citizens of the United States into electing him as "Commander and Chief" of our armed forces that's never even served as a private."Of all the enemies to public liberty war is, perhaps, the most to be dreaded because it comprises and develops the germ of every other. War is the parent of armies; from these proceed debts and taxes. And armies, and debts, and taxes are the known instruments for bringing the many under the domination of the few. In war, too, the discretionary power of the Executive is extended. Its influence in dealing out offices, honors, and emoluments is multiplied; and all the means of seducing the minds, are added to those of subduing the force of the people. The same malignant aspect in republicanism may be traced in the inequality of fortunes, and the opportunities of fraud, growing out of a state of war...and in the degeneracy of manners and morals, engendered by both. No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare." --James Madison, April 20, 1795President 1809 - 1817A Colonel in the Virginia militia during the American Revolution."Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. This is not a way of life at all in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.""I hate war as only a soldier who has lived it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its futility, its stupidity."Dwight D Eisenhower WWII 5 Star General President of the United States 1953 - 1961Republican2015 World military spending #1 The United States $618 billionThey're scamming people into believing we have to worry about China #2 China $171 billionThat's less then 3 times what the United States spent.SLASH every single thing in the budget, SCREW the Citizens of this country,QUADRUPLE the amount spent by China "LOOK AT US!!,"LOOK AT US!!" "WE'RE SAVING THE WORLD" while they pound their chest's like Gorillas in a cage in a zoo.The REAL future of this country? the economy, jobs? we'll never admit it, but we don't have a clue,</comment>

<comment>This makes me sick, not the military spending but where the money goes. Since 9/11 the military budget has exploded but where has it all went? To war profiteers like Halliburton and KBR and NOT our soldiers or veterans, my brother before he passed fought in Desert Storm and the soldiers pay / benefits have not kept up with the times. I would support an increase in military spending if it went to better treat the men/women who put on the uniform.. Then you have these war profiteers get billions from taxpayers and move outside America to avoid paying their taxes like Halliburton or getting away with murdering a dozen soldiers in the cheap showers like KBR.Please help a disabled veteran who lost his wife of 50 years to cancer and veteran son suddenly www.gofundme.com/robertstreich</comment>

<comment>Cut taxes to create a huge deficit, expand military expending to make the deficit even worse.I am more convinced than ever that Ted Cruz is part of Canadian conspiracy to ruin the USA. Either that or he is the actual Antichrist.</comment>

<comment>Have you ever met any Canadians?They will not attack you unless you have the puck.So, yes, he is the antichrist.</comment>

<comment>But if you do have the puck they will bash your head in with a stick. What's up with that?</comment>

<comment>Wash...rinse...repeat. The Republican formula. Cut spending on anything that might help poor and middle class people. Cut taxes on the rich. Raise spending on defense and then invade somebody because they looked at us funny.Wake up America. These people are not on your side.</comment>

<comment>None, absolutely none, of the obscene US military spending is about defence or national security; it's about feeding the war products machine. Ted Cruz is merely signalling to the military contractors who suck up US taxpayers' money with no let or hindrance that if they support him, there will be more pork for everyone. More F35s (The Plane That Ate The Pentagon), more bulging aircraft hangers full of Strykers, Abrams, Baileys etc that there is no possibility of using.. what could go wrong with POTUS Cruz?</comment>

<comment>the moron has voted against funding the military every time it came up.Send this idiot back to Canada</comment>

<comment>Who said freedom is cheap??? Answer: no one!!!How much is mandated ACA (aka slavery) cost us??? Answer: too dam much!!! Especially when you can't use it (deductibles).</comment>

<comment>Typical Republican that NEVER met a war he didn't love, just as long as it means that the defense contractors can reward him with their usual bribes...er..."Campaign Contributions", never mind the fact the he will be taking the deficit higher and higher and higher...and higher. Just following in the footsteps of shrub, and putting everything on the national credit card for future generations to pay, just as we are STILL paying for shrub's wars.</comment>

<comment>tl;dr. Just wanna say, good luck with that auditing the Pentagon thingy. There's about five trillion they simply can't account for. Heck, there's about $12 billion, a comparatively small amount, in CURRENCY, actual paper $100 bills, that they cannot account for. That was shrink-wrapped, palletized, currency that was sent to Paul Bremer and they just let the pallets sit in an unsecured office and let people walk in and help themselves. There were hundreds of billion paid to KBR and Halliburton for contracted work thatwas never done. There were more billions spent on projects that cost ten times as much as in neighboring provinces, were never finished, and could not have done any good anyway. Some of those things have been thoroughly documented, to include the names of people who approved the projects, the names of the people who were supposed to oversee the projects, and the people who promised to do the work, took the money, and did not do the work. How many people want a system like this to continue? Thousands! They'll never allow you to "reform" it any more than we can get rid of that godawful F-35.</comment>
