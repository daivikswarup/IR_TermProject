<comment>On the GOP side, that reflects..what? 5-6000 people? Total?</comment>

<comment>Growing. Like my wife's family. Most of them voted for Gay Barry the first time around. Most didn't the next time.</comment>

<comment>That's still more than all the people that voted in the democratic primary in Nevada.</comment>

<comment>Nope. About 80K voted in the Dem caucus.</comment>

<comment>According to Politico, about 11.000 people voted in the Dem caucus. Check it out here: http://www.politico.com/2016-e.... Still more than 8000, but a painfully small number nonetheless. And nowhere NEAR 80k.</comment>

<comment>NBC and CNN are reporting 80,000 Dem caucus goers. I think the confusion arises because the Dems have some weird system where they don't count voters directly.</comment>

<comment>But a 70.000 voter difference? Seems weird...foul play?</comment>

<comment>Jeez, you're right. Shouldn't have grabbed the first result that I found.</comment>

<comment>Mind telling me where you found it? The difference is just WAY too big for it to be a mistake.</comment>

<comment>I don't recall my specific source, but it seems there is more than one place reporting 80,000. I assumed I made a mistake, but the error must be Politicos. Republican turnout was 75K, after all. A Dem total of about 10K is ludicrous.</comment>

<comment>Well, I was watching Fox News as the results were coming in, and the numbers were similar to Politico's. I just don't know which other trustworthy source I can check...maybe the Nevada government web? I'll check there I guess...</comment>

<comment>Look, I checked in the NY Times, NBC, Fox News, WaPo, and they all have numbers similar to mine.</comment>

<comment>Hispanic citizens are the most harmed by illegal immigration. Trump's wall protects them too.</comment>

<comment>Paul Krugman“The New Deal made America a vastly better place, yet it probably wouldn’t have been possible without the immigration restrictions that went into effect after World War I.”“Once immigration restrictions were in place, and immigrants already here gained citizenship, this disenfranchised class at the bottom shrank rapidly, helping to create the political conditions for a stronger social safety net.”“I like to say that if you don’t feel conflicted about these issues, there’s something wrong with you.”http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11...Lourdes Gouveia, a sociologist who directs UNO’s Office of Latino/Latin American Studies, said she fears that Hispanics — who have surpassed blacks as the metro area’s largest minority group — could be falling into the same cycle of multigenerational poverty that has long ravaged black communities in Omaha and across the nation.http://www.limitstogrowth.org/...“I think it’s really important to sound this alarm,” she said. “If there are not sufficient interventions to halt this downward trend, we are going to see poverty rates close to African-American poverty, and neighborhoods with pockets of violence — because that’s what happens when young people lose hope.”</comment>

<comment>Blacks want to co-opt Hispanics into their world of deprivation and pain because they recognize the fact that Hispanics will surpass them in the social order. Hispanics only need look at the failed black experience to know that following them down a darkened pathway leads only to individual muggings and institutional ruin.</comment>

<comment>Guess what? Conservative hispanics LOVE Trump! You wanna know why? Because when they or their parents came to America...SURPRISE...they didn't wanna bring they're country of origin along with them! They wanted to LEAVE Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, or wherever they came from, behind. So yeah...expect to be surprised, liberals.</comment>

<comment>Trump can't even pull half of Republican Hispanics, I'm not worried.</comment>

<comment>Trump's a liberal.</comment>

<comment>He's not a "liberal" in any meaningful sense that he believes in civil liberties & rights, or enlightenment ideals. He's actually very anti-liberal.</comment>

<comment>Like eminent domain.  FOOL</comment>

<comment>Eminent domain is not liberal in the sense I used it. By all means, continue insulting people because you fail to understand words in context.</comment>

<comment>Trump is very liberal in his conservative positions.</comment>

<comment>No he's not.</comment>

<comment>Here are facts: 20% of 20%, 4% of Hispanics. Fun.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>More than Romney. Fun.</comment>

<comment>"85 percent of Latinos in California have an unfavorable opinion of the Donald compared to just 10 percent who rate him favorably."Mexican, without a high school diploma and tribal, of course you get 85% against Trump's soundbite in California but if you didn't deal with Mexicans, lowly educated and universal in outlook numbers might change but that would require a grain of salt.</comment>

<comment>Ah ha, which is why literally the least educated Republicans support Trump.</comment>

<comment>I don't know chief, people might support him holding their thumb and index to their nose. "Trump’s electoral strength—and his staying power—have been buoyed, above all, by Americans with authoritarian inclinations. And because of the prevalence of authoritarians in the American electorate, among Democrats as well as Republicans, it’s very possible that Trump’s fan base will continue to grow."Most Latin Americans are caudillistas: Typically, the caudillos took it upon themselves to attain power over society and place themselves as its leader. Caudillos were capable of commanding large numbers of people and holding the attention of large crowds with growing excitement. cultural phenomenon that first appeared during the early 19th century in revolutionary Spanish America.http://www.politico.com/magazi...</comment>

<comment>You seem to be under the impression that Hispanics will vote for an authoritarian that scapegoats them for societal problems to win votes from snarling racists and virulently angry white voters.</comment>

<comment>"'Trump has also—to the chagrin of nativists in the GOP—said that, in the case of Mexico, he would put “a door” in that giant border where immigrants could re-enter legally. But that point was obscured because liberals didn’t want to give Trump credit for complexity, and conservatives preferred to think of him as more solidly in line with their desire to give the undocumented immigrants a one-way ticket out of the country with no return.The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems…When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”'</comment>

<comment>Not true at all. But you should be beating up a gay person, since you hate them.</comment>

<comment>Considering my son is gay and I supported him coming out, I'll laugh.</comment>

<comment>Sure thing, homophobe.</comment>

<comment>ummm, I don't know, most H i s p a n i c s are Mexican (and socially, their similar Central Americans) and culture doesn't vanish easily w/o intermarriage and education. They are likely to remain alienated and blame outside factors like the same factors that kept them down in Mexico: racism, exclusion, discrimination, lack of social cohesion..."More than any other factor, Telles and Ortiz said, education accounted for the slow assimilation of Mexican Americans in most social dimensions. The low educational levels of Mexican Americans have impeded most other types of integration."Their limited schooling locks many of them into a future of low socioeconomic status," they said. "Low levels of education also predict lower rates of intermarriage, a weaker American identity, and a lower likelihood of registering to vote and voting."Second-, third- and fourth-generation Mexican Americans speak English fluently, and most prefer American music. They are increasingly Protestant, and some may even vote for a Republican candidate.However, many Mexican Americans in these later generations do not graduate from college, and they continue to live in majority Hispanic neighborhoods. Most marry other Hispanics and think of themselves as "Mexican" or "Mexican American."…The study's authors, UCLA sociologists Edward E. Telles and Vilma Ortiz, examined various markers of integration among Mexican Americans in Los Angeles and San Antonio, Texas, including educational attainment, economic advancement, English and Spanish proficiency, residential integration, intermarriage, ethnic identity and political involvement.Key findings from "Generations of Exclusion" include:• The educational levels of second-generation Mexican Americans improved dramatically. But the third and fourth generations failed to surpass, and to some extent fell behind, the educational level of the second generation. Moreover, the educational levels of all Mexican Americans still lag behind the national average.• Economic status improved from the first to second generation but stalled in the third and fourth generation. Earnings, occupational status and homeownership were still alarmingly low for later generations. Low levels of schooling among Mexican Americans were the main reason for lower income, occupational status and other indicators of socioeconomic status.• Adult Mexican Americans in the third and fourth generation lived in more segregated neighborhoods than they did as youths. This was due to the high number of Latinos and immigrants moving into these neighborhoods, the researchers said.• Most Mexican Americans identified as "Mexican" or "Mexican American," even into the fourth generation. Only about 10 percent identified as "American." Moreover, many Mexican Americans felt their ethnicity was very important and many said they would like to pass it along to their children.• Among Hispanic 16- to 24-year-olds in the United States, 17.6 percent were high school dropouts in 2009, compared with 9.3 percent of African-Americans and 5.2 percent of whites in the same age group, although the rate for Hispanics has steadily improved, according to The Condition of Education 2011, published by the U.S. Department of Education.♦ EDWeek.org♦ Barbara A.

<comment>Trump received less than 50% of GOP Latinos (8% of the caucus) in a small caucus of politicos and that means he's strong among Latinos? It's like I'm taking crazy pills.</comment>

<comment>SP*CS AND YARDAPES ARE SUB-HUMAN</comment>

<comment>How did you find this place? Was there a link posted in Stormfront or something like that?</comment>

<comment>I'm confused. is Cruz Cuban or Canadian?</comment>

<comment>I'm Cuban American and will not be voting for Cruz or Rubio. If you believe that folks of Latin American origin will vote for someone sharing the same language but not similar views, you are not well informed on this very diverse (not monolithic) group.   Frankly, most Latinos for well founded and not well founded reasons don't particularly like Cubans.  I could bore you with specifics.Stone Soup:  don't understand your premise that Hispanic citizens are more disenfranchised by immigration. Yes, a significant percentage of undocumented may come from Latin America but not all. And many of us "Hispanics" as we are collectively called but frankly do not identify with, are highly educated (Bachelos, Masters, PhDs, etc) and do not "compete" for the low wage jobs that these folks are willing to take since most US natives feel to far above to do (like pick the vegetables that end up at your dinner table).To Redneck sensei:  There may be Latinos who support Trump but I highly doubt your reason.  One of the reasons that you "Dial 1 for English and 2 for Spanish" is because unlike the waves of immigrants from Europe in the 1880s-1920s, Latinos do bring their country of origin with them. They do not discard their identities; instead they fuse their origins with their new land.  Many do not want to leave their homelands. They leave for economic reasons and faithfully send their earnings from their meager wages to family back home.   Let me know how many of us you truly know.Finally, to Beelzebub:  only people that insult others in the fashion you have employed do so because by putting others below you gives you the perception that you are above. Your caps demonstrate your anger and your choice of epitaphs demonstrates your degree of ignorance. </comment>

<comment>Amigo, who gives a shit? This group of people are dying day by day.</comment>

<comment>You are Cuban and educated not Mexican and average, uneducated. You do not represent most Hispanic voters who vote with the tribe against imaginary or real external enemies.This is by the Pew Hispanic Research Center, pro illegal data: Educational attainment. Mexicans have lower levels of education than the Hispanic population overall. Some 10% of Mexicans ages 25 and older—compared with 13% of all U.S. Hispanics—have obtained at least a bachelor’s degree. Mexicans born in the U.S. are almost three times more likely to have earned a bachelor’s degree than those born in Mexico—15% vs. 6% respectively. About six-in-ten Mexican immigrants have not earned a high school diploma (59%), compared with 21% of Mexicans born in the U.S.You see, the positive narrative changes not reality.</comment>

<comment>Why is the standard White in your narrative an urban liberal who has abandoned their European heritage? Most conservative Whites I associate with know exactly where their ancestors are from and are quite proud of it. There's nothing like meeting someone who comes from the same part of a European country as you do. White ethnic clubs are very popular among both recent immigrants and the descendants of immigrants. A White will always go out of their way to help another co-ethnic (even if that co-ethnist is a liberal!). My Church has a yearly European pilgrimage. The local Catholic College requires every student spend one semester at its sister school in Bavaria. Recent immigrants even help the American descendants of immigrants apply for citizenship in their countries of origin.</comment>

<comment>Jajaja, Republicans concern trolling. Trump appeals to 20% of Hispanic conservatives or 4% of the Hispanic vote.He won 3% of the Hispanic vote in Nevada, the highest of any Republican. Good show.http://fivethirtyeight.com/fea...Good luck putas. Going to need it.</comment>

<comment>Conservatives keep saying Trump will get Black and Hispanic votes, but Trump is a virulent nationalist with a base of pissed off white people. It makes me laugh that they think this is how to win over minorities.</comment>

<comment>"The N*GGERS and S*ICS will vote Trump!"Amigo, no Democrat has gotten less than 86% of the black vote since 1960 and Hispanics hate Trump more than blacks.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should focus on not hating gays.Thanks, puta!</comment>

<comment>This is a nonsense article.  Of the very very few Republican hispanics 43% plus or minus 10% (!!!) voted for Trump.Big deal.  More than half did NOT vote for him out of this tiny group of Republican hispanics.  To connect that to a changing electorate is really bad, even ludicrous, journalism of the absolute worst kind.Shame on you.</comment>

<comment>About 28% of Nevada Hispanic caucus-goers were GOP, according to the published numbers.</comment>

<comment>The author should have made the racial distinction.  Latino or Hispanics are not one homogeneous group racially. White Latinos of Spanish descent of which there are going to be millions both sides of the border are more likely to be Conservative.  They are also going to be familiar and have a great deal of fear about the other 'latinos' ie the full blood and mixed blood mestizo gangbanging welfare dependent La Raza supporters who see the Democrats as their ticket to flood America with their rat breeding brothers sisters and cousins. That's about the gist of the situation.</comment>

<comment>Whites of Spanish colonial descent actually have quite a bit in common with Americans of French and British colonial descent.</comment>

<comment>To all that responded to Cuban gal....Truth be said, we all have valid points in this discussion.  I appreciate the respect that we can demonstrate to each other as we posit our views.To Courageous:  No one said that White Europeans haven't kept their roots.  It is purely observational, but as many of Europeans migrating over to the US made a conscious decision to abandon their native language as soon as they arrived. Granted they all spoke different languages unlike Latin Americans who share a common language.  I spoke to nothing else but this observation.  Of course, as generations are removed from that first immigrant, they further assimilate as well as add to what is the new culture but slowly move away from the language and customs of the original immigrant.  I can't expect my son nor did I ever want to inculcate in him my "Cubaness".  Yet, there are customs that my mother and I brought with us that I continue to uphold but have fused with customs and mores of the culture I've lived and participated in.  And once he visited Cuba and his Cuban family, he found a deep love and attraction for that side of his heritage.   This came from him organically.To Antony Palmer:  correctTo Alec:  Please refer to The Immigration Act of 1965 that changed the pattern of predominantly letting in White of European background (there are 34 ethnic groups comprising the label of "white") to accepting all nationalities (which of course is identification along the lines of nation states) on a roughly equal basis.  You are on the mark on the issue of authoritarian tendencies both Dem and GOP and how Trump is leveraging these tendencies.  Beware, we may end up having reverse immigration going back to ancestral lands.  You are right that intermarriage does not erase or blur the lines.  This is quite evident along racial (Black, White, Mulato, Mestizo) Latin Americans and Europeans who (in the case of Latin America as I can only speak to this) who find us-the children of the Europeans who came to the New World (Criollos), less than.To Stone Soup:  "Hispanics" "Latinos"-terms that for the most part we do not label ourselves with as we are diverse despite sharing a common language, probably won't be co-opted by Blacks.  It is not social order but political power that drives social order.  Look at the Cubans as an example.  We represent 3% of the "Hispanic" population and yet the political power that has kept an immoral blockade (refer to Lester Mallory Assistant Secretary of Western Hemisphere April 6, 1961 referring that the objective of the embargo should be to "cause hunger, starvation, depreciation in real wages for the Cuban people") against a small (yet geopolitically and geographically strategic land mass) island in effect for more than 54 years has come from the very Cubans (Batistianos) that left the island losing all of their power then and hoping to restore it through its machinations and narrative.  The very Cubans who are the nephews of Fidel Castro in the US Congress and more.  It is their power that has driven countless of Presidential hopefuls to Versaille Restaurant in Little Havana to pander to the power brokers who finance them.  So, a blanket statement on Latin Americans in the US (as we are Americans too) is not fully descriptive.Thanks to all for a lively, healthy and respectful discussion.  I hope that as I pass along my perspective, others learn as well as I learn from others perspectives.  .</comment>

<comment>They'll have to show IDs to vote.Good luck with that. hahahahahahaha</comment>

<comment>Trumps boast is indeed a boast.But his showing does indicate that his support from Hispanics is more than people thought.Support enough? Who knows at this point. But better than his detractors would have expected.</comment>

<comment>Can't stump the Trump! We can't afford another politician in the White House. Donald Trump has no political liabilities because he has been in politics for less than a year. </comment>
