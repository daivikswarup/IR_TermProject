<comment>Is that $27,000/family regardless of family size? Is Obama going after large Christian families with this tax?</comment>

<comment>Yes, but only large white X-tian families. Large Latin families that are here legally and are Roman Catholic are exempt.</comment>

<comment>Every plan I've ever seen is either Single or Family.  I guess you'd have a valid point if you were buying a single plan for each individual in the family.  But that's not how it works.</comment>

<comment>You don't have enough experience, then.  A lot of plans I've seen are (a) employee only, (b) employee plus spouse, (c) employee plus children but no spouse, or (d) employee plus spouse and children.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, but even those options do not meet the original complaint about going after large families.</comment>

<comment>If you have a nice heath plan.  The Democrates going to tax that heath plan.</comment>

<comment>I thought the first "heath" was a typo, but then you wrote "heath" again.  And then you started talking about an obscure Greek philosopher. Is there a secret message here? Something to do with the "Joker"?</comment>

<comment>One of the least discussed factors in the upcoming elections is this tax and the increased costs and ridiculous deductables  that obamacare is inflicting on the middle class workers.  There will be a backlash that the democrats have completely ignored .</comment>

<comment>You only have a high deductible if you choose a high deductible plan, bud. There is a plethora of choice in this regard.</comment>

<comment>And if you choose a lower deductible then you pay a much higher premium. Many middle class families are forced into the higher deductibles due to the premium costs.</comment>

<comment>It's the same as it was when they were on employer sponsored plans. When annual enrollment came around, you chose your plan...if you wanted the lower deductible, you payed more. This is not new, it is how insurance works.</comment>

<comment>Yes true but under obamacare you are getting less for more.</comment>

<comment>Finally, you get to your real point.I'm not going down that rabbit hole with you, I have to do some actual work at some point today. Have a good one.</comment>

<comment>Running from the facts? OK  Have a good one.</comment>

<comment>This was supposed to be an improvement both in the number of insured, and the quality of insurance for those already insured. It has mostly screwed those already insured with worse options than before. Many people have increased premiums/deductibles, and many lost the plan they were told "if you like...you can keep". So even if what you are saying is true, the overall costs for many have increased, making the "plethora" of choices you mentioned a non-starter.</comment>

<comment>There's no free lunch.  If you're healthy, go low premium/high deductible.  If not, go high premium/low deductible.  All of the exchange plans have a max out-of-pocket, too.</comment>

<comment>I agree with the premise but want to point out that the tax hits AFTER the current Presidential election.  So people who do not pay attention to health care politics will be largely unaware.  </comment>

<comment>Nope, Bernie hasn't ignored it at all.</comment>

<comment>lol. </comment>

<comment>The idea that companies will use savings on healthcare to pay higher wages is laughable. It's not like the first thing companies think to do when they have an extra pile of money lying around is to raise wages. Additionally, given that the cost of premiums continues to rapidly increase, these companies literally might not have any savings at all. Whatever money companies could save by trimming "Cadillac" healthcare plans (and thus pass on to workers) is quickly eaten up by the rising costs of basic plans themselves! The trimming of healthcare benefits is a natural reaction to rising healthcare costs which was already happening before Obamacare and the "Cadillac tax." Companies are trimming healthcare plans because their healthcare costs already exceeded their healthcare budgets years ago. All the "Cadillac tax" has done is speed the trimming of benefits up by 5-10 years.</comment>

<comment>It's not like the first thing companies think to do when they have an extra pile of money lying around is to raise wagesThey give the executives raises along with bonuses.</comment>

<comment>Well, it hasn't done anything because it hasn't come into effect yet. There was some talk in the recent UAW-GM negotiations that the Cadillac tax might become an issue in the future, but as it was delayed they're sitting pretty.</comment>

<comment>Conservatives say Obamacare is free stuff, and also makes insurance too expensive to buy.  It does nothing to contain costs, except for discouraging "cover every service you could ever want" plans that increase costs.  It's a government takeover that is a gift to private insurance companies.  The article even says the insurance companies are looking for ways to reduce costs to keep the plans profitable and under the tax threshold.  That reduces costs.The average family plan costs around $16k, so it is indeed only the plans that lead to higher costs that will be affected.  If the insurer decides a $30k plan is worth the $1,200-ish tax ( (30k-27k) * .4) , they'll keep them going.  Congress can always adjust the threshold, too.</comment>

<comment>It would be nice if the article made it clearer whether the tax applied to the entire cost of expensive plans or only to the portion over the threshold.</comment>

<comment>Only above.</comment>

<comment>At least my situation has been impacted. My company switched (10K+ employees) from a PPO to an HDHP with an HSA account. Works out great for me bc I'm a young invincible and never use heathcare. The company is throwing in $600 pretax seed money every year. I been able to save $6700 (again pretax) in two years, well more than enough to cover the max out-of-pocket if something happens.</comment>

<comment>My previous company offered that as an option before Obama was even elected.</comment>

<comment>Agreed that was an option before Obamacare. But it was Obamacare that caused the entire company to be pushed into a HDHP bc of the Cadillac Tax.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't make sense.  If you were getting a $27k plan, how would cutting it back to basically nothing be forced by this tax?</comment>

<comment>Here is what I want to know. Before Obummercare, private insurance for my wife and I was $600/month. Now it is $1500/month. What gives? Apparently very few people who make good money go to the doctor if they don't need to, and screwing the consumer has little effect on healthcare costs. If a doctor did start having fewer visits, why not raise fees 10%? His costs for rent, insurance, accounting, etc aren't any getting any cheaper. A nurse did tell that people on welfare will go to the doctor for entertainment, so we can expect the most abuse from the expanded low end. The whole thing promulgated by those who live in their liberal fantasy and can't be bothered with untidy reality. A pox on them all.</comment>

<comment>You should shop around for a better plan.  With millions of people getting insurance, and annual checkups being covered with no co-pay (making "good money" is irrelevant) , doctor's offices are busier than ever.</comment>

<comment>Congratulations, you are now paying about what I am paying and I don't have ACA coverage. My employer-based insurance has been cruising the upper atmosphere of expenses for some time, way before the ACA was even a topic of discussion.</comment>

<comment>That to me still seems awfully generous. I have pretty good health coverage via my employer, single, and its only $375/mo total. To hit the level for Cadillac tax, the premiums would need to more than double. At that point, I would say that's awfully expensive coverage that should get an extra tax</comment>

<comment>I doubt that tax hits anyone on this site...</comment>

<comment>I already pay double what you do for my family of four and on top of that, have a $3,000 deductible for each member of my family. So we don't run to the doctor for every sniffle since it is all out of pocket expenses for us. That tax will hit a lot of people as the cost of insurance keeps rising faster than the threshold.</comment>

<comment>That's still 9k a year, which is far far below the cadillac threshold of 28k for a family.And of course if the cost of insurance keeps increasing faster than inflation that's a problem that will hit everyone eventually, whether they have expensive health insurance or not.</comment>

<comment>And what share of your health insurance premiums is your employer paying? I pay about $400/month, but my employer is paying 4x that much, for a total of almost $25,000/year. I might get hit with this tax even though my coverage is crap.</comment>

<comment>No, I pay ~$50/month of my share, and my employer pays about $350 for their share. So $400/mo total, leading to ~$4800 total cost to insure me (single adult) for the year, with decent coverage, at a small/middle sized, privately owned firm</comment>

<comment>I don't get the concept of a Cadillac health plan. It's not a luxury. Who goes to the doctor more because it's insured, unless you're sick?Unless it covers plastic surgery and trips to the Bahamas, why is a health plan considered a frivolity?</comment>

<comment>Maybe it does? The average insurance cost for a family is 14K, this only applies to those twice that.Anyway I believe the point is to gradually break the connection between employment and insurance. Many (large) companies like to pay insurance as a form of compensation because they can avoid taxes.</comment>

<comment>Then just make health insurance illegal. That would have been the way to do it. </comment>

<comment>There has GOT to be a better way to do health care finance in this country.</comment>

<comment>If the government had just made health insurance illegal that would have chsnged everything for the better. Prices would have fallen to what people can actually pay. </comment>

<comment>It's hilarious to listen to conservatives blame Obamacare for the increase in premiums and deductibles, as if those things wouldn't have increased anyway. The real problem with Obamacare and the problem that neither the Republicans nor Hillary Clinton want to solve is that a for-profit health care system where consumers rely on insurance companies will always be one with rising costs. Why? First, you have a system where most of the players (doctors, hospitals, drug companies) have a huge incentive to recommend drugs, tests, and procedures that patients don't actually need. Second, you have the moral hazard problem the article mentioned. People who have insurance are more likely to use it, especially if they're paying a lot for it. Third, you have a food supply which is making people sicker. We subsidize corn which leads to cheap junk food, but don't bother subsidizing farmers who grow vegetables. We don't regulate sugar, which has to be one of the most dangerous, not to mention addictive, substances around. And we put out nutritional guidelines telling people to eat a ton of bread and dairy, no doubt because those industries have spent millions lobbying the government. We constantly hear about a shortage of doctors and other health care professionals. But it doesn't help matters that those professions do everything they can to limit supply, thereby protecting their high salaries.Getting rid of the Cadillac tax, which should really be called the Mercedes tax or Lexus tax since people stopped buy Cadillacs in the 80s, won't solve the problem. You have to make the health care system no longer for-profit, you have to give people a stronger incentive to take care of themselves and not abuse the health care system, and you have to change the food supply cause the one we have now is only making Americans sicker.</comment>

<comment>You are the hilarious one. You mentioned that GOVERNMENT is responsible for sugar in everything which is making so many of us fat and ill...but then you don't bother to ask why?! And if the government is getting fatter and more powerful by poisoning us with cheap sugar then, and if government can't stop doing this, then what makes YOU think this same government is honestly trying to help us with healthcare?!Look at Flint, MI. That was government doing the poisoning of those kids. What is our government doing to hold government official accountable for that?! Nothing! They are doing nothing. They are doing nothing! They are doing nothing! The EPA kept lying to those people. The EPA lied. The EPA lied! And nobody is being held accountable. Why can't you get it through your head. Government only cares about itself.The more power you give government the worse things are for everyone. </comment>

<comment>Well, at least with the delay to 2020 this year's bargaining agreement negotiations won't suck on that particular issue.</comment>

<comment>Amen, my bargaining unit's contract is up June 30 and we will be bargaining over this.</comment>

<comment>The irony being the unit's only choice would be to leave CalPERS -- which they bargained for twenty years ago -- if they want to avoid the chance of eventually being sucked in to the Cadillac tax.</comment>

<comment>The exact thing that makes my health insurance more affordable overall (enrolling younger, healthier workers) is what they are going to tax!  My union insurance has the same premium no matter whether it only covers the employee or the employee plus spouse and dependents, and it will likely be taxed under this part of ACA.</comment>

<comment>If your plan is becoming cheaper how will it hit this tax, which only applies to those more than twice the average price?</comment>

<comment>I never wrote that the plan is becoming cheaper, but that it is more affordable overall-that is, to the union Trust as well as to us employees.  For the premium we pay (actually my employer fully pays the premium, but not all employers in this Trust pay the full premium), the market doesn't offer health insurance coverage as good as we have, and that premium also covers vision, dental, and short-term disability pay.  The reason it works is that employers have to pay the premium (which is a flat amount per hour worked per employee) even for 16-year-old employees who work at least 20 hours in a month (and of course, they get the insurance too).For a 40-hour-per-week employee (regardless whether it's just that employee or that employee plus 12 family members) the premium is about $900 per month right now.  I think that is the lower boundary of the Cadillac tax.</comment>

<comment>Healthcare costs continue to rise. If you owned a hospital and the government paid for everything why wouldn't you keep raising fees? </comment>

<comment>TotoCatcher wrote: "Healthcare costs continue to rise. If you owned a hospital and the government paid for everything why wouldn't you keep raising fees?"Nice strawman you have there, hope nothing happens to it.</comment>

<comment>When the government has placed itself into the middle of something when has the costs ever decreased?! How could they? There is no incentive to reduce costs when it impacts everyone.Our population is growing thanks to government immigration policy. The envrionment is more and more depleted. And resources are more expensive while wages are not keeping up (thanks to government defegulation of borders and trade). </comment>

<comment>What BS. My huge corporate employer had their Deathstar full of lawyers ruin down every possible angle of Obamacare. The result was eviscerating our middling "OK" medical plan to a bare bones miserable joke- Out of fear of "the Cadillac Tax".The plan was in no way "Cadillac" before, now it's not even Hyundai.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't go into effect for a couple of years, why would they have done this already?</comment>

<comment>Many tax laws look at the past too. They average things. Also they may have started now because they are a very large corporation and things take time to implement. There are lots of reasons corporations do things. </comment>

<comment>But look at how well its controlling costs...oh wait, no its not.</comment>

<comment>Obamacare is such a bad piece of legislation. Its corporate welfare. It does nothing to improve healthcare or lower costs. It just props up insurance corporations. And that is what Obama meant for it to do.Progressives just want bigger and bigger government. Look at Flint, MI. The government poisoned those kids. Is the Obama administration doing anything to hold governmenf accountable? No.Look at Obama's record on the environment too. The largest environmental disasters in our history are happening under his watch. Fracking, deep ocean drilling, etc. Look at what is happening in California. These are more examples of big government. </comment>

<comment>A great healthcare plan is one of the incentives that my employer advertises to potential employees. Living in Rural Alaska where healthcare is scarce to begin with good benefits are a must to keep good employees.  We do have awesome healthcare ($50 deductible, no copay, $1500 max out of pocket, employees only pay $72 a month for premium costs) .....but why should my employer and consequently employees be penalized for it? When it comes down to it I would rather keep our healthcare plan than receive a pay increase, which is what advocates of the tax are saying will be the result.</comment>
