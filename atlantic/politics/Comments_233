<comment>"Is a multiethnic democracy possible?"Probably not. Where has it ever been successful?</comment>

<comment>Switzerland</comment>

<comment>Switzerland is a very prosperous, stable, Western country. Why would the USA want to be anything like Switzerland? /s</comment>

<comment>Its certainly on my list of places to move to if Bernie Sanders gets elected.</comment>

<comment>But, but, they have a Federal mandate to buy health insurance. Mandatory universal health insurance. The tyrants! /s</comment>

<comment>Switzerland's health insurance system is a little more complex than that. Their universal insurance is meant to be supplemented by private policies. It's not quite like the single-payer in other countries.</comment>

<comment>It's not a revelation that national health insurance policy is complex and differs between countries. I'm just saying that Switzerland has universal healthcare coverage, mandated purchase of insurance, controlled costs and very good results.My response was to Courageousmisterj who says he'll consider moving to Switzerland if Sanders is elected. My assumption is that he would want to get away from that democratic socialist Bernie by moving to 'free market' Switzerland. Thus my sarcasm.</comment>

<comment>They also take that “organized militia” thing pretty seriously. You really have to join the military and train--universal military service--and not gather down at the bar and talk to the other barflies about your right to own firearms.</comment>

<comment>From two issues that I've examined Sanders and Clinton's policies, it seems that Clinton is the more extreme. Sanders may bend socialistic, but he is for proportional equality much like Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. They don't have federal power like we do at all.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't change the fact that they have a Federal mandate to purchase health insurance.</comment>

<comment>They are a tax and regulatory haven in Europe. Besides, I don't really care if my taxes go to people I like.</comment>

<comment>At least you're honest...</comment>

<comment>Taxes going to support the Swiss welfare system is A OK, but taxes going to the American welfare system is illegitimate. Got it, that sounds totally well thought out!</comment>

<comment>That's a great idea, that's exactly the system that Bernie is pushing. So you can see first hand how well it works.</comment>

<comment>70% Christian, 70% German. They have a dominant ethnic group. Also, every major ethnic group is white.</comment>

<comment>Switzerland is one of the most xenophobic countries on Earth.</comment>

<comment>I think Switzerland is pretty awesome but I am not sure it is a very good example of multi-ethnic. It is a country of white people speaking 4 different languages. </comment>

<comment>Switzerland is the equivalent of Bob's Country Bunker from the Blues Brothers.  "We have both kinds of Music here, country and western"</comment>

<comment>You know, you're going to look pretty funny trying to eat corn-on-the-cob without no fuckin' teeth.</comment>

<comment>Like most civilized European countries that the Bernie Sanders and the rest of the socialist left love so much, Switzerland probably requires voters to present identification before they can exercise their democratic rights.If we can't put an ID in every citizen's hand we should just give up.  No hope for us to educate the population or keep civil order either...Without photo ID you can't get a job, open or attend to a bank account, get on a plane, enter many public buildings, etc. etc.  Without ID these citizens are disenfranchised in more ways than voting.</comment>

<comment>That's all true. So let's establish a program to provide everyone with Voter ID's that can be used for everything except driving. We'll set it up so that anyone who wants one can get it at the local post office. We'll keep those open on Saturdays and Sundays so poor people who work can get them. We'll pay for the new hires and expanded hours through the general revenue.. . . And the moment you propose that, you see what the whole idea of "Voter ID's" is all about. If it's so important, why not make it a free public service? And the question answers itself: because the importance of the "Voter ID's" was never really the issue for 99% of the people advocating so strenuously for them.</comment>

<comment>No kidding. It's also why the voter ID's tend to come with massive purges of the voter roles that disproportionately targets black and Latino voters, restrictions on early and absentee voting, and fewer polling stations located in cities. You know, all things any reasonable person can agree make the vote freer and fairer.</comment>

<comment>The idea of a photo ID isn't a bad one, it's they way it's being implemented that is the problem. And its intention is to prevent the poor from voting. Republicans have already stated as much.http://billmoyers.com/2014/10/...The IDs should be free and available at every Post Office in the US.</comment>

<comment>Does no one know that the poor can get free ID's? And even then, does not every state offer a non-drivers license ID as well? I know I had one when I was younger.Honestly, getting an ID is super easy. If you're too old to get an ID (you didn't already have one during your life?) maybe you shouldn't be voting anyways, considering you're going to be dead soon.There is no argument for the poor. Laziness (which is typical of the poor) is the only reason they don't have an ID (but then, how do they collect welfare?).The people arguing against having an ID to vote (also, aren't there about 10 different acceptable forms?) have no ground to stand upon, pure and simple.</comment>

<comment>How about (as another poster has already written) if we initiate a national voter ID program. The federal government could ensure that every U.S. citizen recieves a photo ID, free of charge and by way of post offices and/or other government agencies, shortly before their 18th birthday, which would be used in all elections at the federal, state and local levels.Could you get behind something like that?</comment>

<comment>As long as it wasn't mandatory, sure. The thing is, state's already offer basically that. Programs are already in place to help get people an ID if they want an ID, it just takes a very minimal effort. Hell, illegal aliens can get ID's, what's stopping supposed red-blooded Americans from getting one?The whole argument about ID's is basically about laziness, which, honestly, is the real argument under-girding most political discussions. If you are arguing against requiring an ID, you are either for laziness, or you are for voter fraud. Neither is a very flattering position to hold.</comment>

<comment>It's not laziness. It's a deliberate undermining of the system. The pro-lifers do the same thing. You don't just shut down abortion clinics, you pass byzantine laws about hallway width so they're forced to shut down. It's the same thing Chavez did in Venezuela to consolidate power. If you have to take time off work in your hourly job, find a babysitter, lose money, get to the one office across town without a car, present multiple forms  of ID you don't have (renters are less likely to have bills in their name, for example), it's a deliberate effort to stop certain people from voting. You know that and you're trying to be cute, just like the people who used to demand "literacy tests" were trying to be cute.And democracy equals one person, one vote. You're a citizen, you're over 18, you're not a felon, you get to vote. Full stop.</comment>

<comment>Firstly, yeah, no problem with what we do to stop baby killers. Won't even protest that.Secondly, how the f*ck do you propose we actually determine people are citizens, are 18, and not a felon, if they don't show an ID?  Force them to speak English, 'cause we know everyone speaks English in the US<sarc>? Do an American tap dance? Twirl around all pretty-like? Every valid form of ID is acceptable. Birth certificate, military ID, regular ID, drivers license... Like, sh*t, you literally just want to be able to walk in and vote with zero restrictions, eh? Fine, as long as I can drive a few counties over and drop in 500 yes votes for every Republican on the ballot.</comment>

<comment>If, to receive food stamps, you are required to show up at an office during regular hours, is that the government's covert way of making poor people starve? There has to be a minimal effort on people's part.There are laws regarding employers letting people have time off to vote. Why not the same when you're getting an ID?</comment>

<comment>Have you reneewed your driver's license lately? It's not so simple.Even if you've had a valid license for decades, you now need a bunch of documents that you didn't need before. Each state has its own list of what is and isn't acceptable and there is no consistency or reason to what is OK in one state vs. another. It's not always easy to get yet another copy of your birth certificate or whatever else is required.Once you have gathered all the required documents, you need to be able to take time off on a workday to go hang out at the DMV. And you need reliable transportation to get there.All of these things are hard for poor people working 2 or more jobs. There are plenty of poor folks who are not lazy. But the non-lazy ones have little time to go through these hoops to get or renew an ID. And that is the goal of these laws, to make it hard enough that a significant number of poor voters stop voting. That's why the ID laws also roll back early and weekend voting--to prevent working people from getting to the polls.Why isn't Election Day a legal holiday in the US? It is in many countries. But again, that would help poor people vote--which is what the the supporters of these laws don't want.</comment>

<comment>Meh, not really. I can get a new one by simply going on-line, typing in a few numbers (the most important being my old license number), hitting send, and I have a new license in a few days.And who said voting was supposed to be so easy that we literally have no checks on who is voting? If even one person votes who shouldn't vote, your vote counts less, and the process has no value or meaning. It's how 110% of people end up voting in certain places.And boohoo, it's "hard" to get an ID. DMV's aren't as bad as they used to be (here in Texas, you can sign up on-line, reserve a spot and time, and show up then). Don't have a birth certificate? Sucks, but that's on you or your parents, not anyone else's fault. I took mine from my worthless sack-o-shit mother a long time ago for the explicit reason of not wanting to go through the horror that is getting a new one. But guess what, it should be hard to get a new birth certificate, for obvious reasons. Can't just have any ol' f*ck walk up and say they are xyz person and get a birth certificate. Sh*t, at this point, all you seem to be advocating for is easier identification theft.I'm all for having an election day holiday, and have never come across anyone who said it would be a bad idea. But, guess what, voting is always open for more than one day. There's early voting almost everywhere, and early voting has longer, more flexible hours. Not to mention, you can vote damn near everywhere, and there is absentee voting. And if you did a little studying of history, you would know why election day is on a Tuesday (wikipedia explains it succinctly).Still should have robust voting ID laws. It's the only way to guarantee that only US citizens are voting, and voting in the correct place. In a country this large and diverse, it's our only option.</comment>

<comment>One citizen, one vote. Not one property-owning, driving, international-travelling citizen. One citizen. Did you miss the first day of civics class?That's why the GOP uses tricks to ensure that by total coincidence, some IDs matter more than others. Student IDs (young people are more likely to vote Democrat) don't count. Passports (poor people are less likely to have them) do. And then use bureaucracy to stop people from getting IDs. Locate the offices in inconvenient places and at inconvenient hours. Wait a few years and they'll probably bring back poll taxes.Of course, it should be the number one priority of the Democratic party to ensure every likely voter HAS the ID and votes consistently, but the system is still massively unfair and probably illegal.</comment>

<comment>Know why student ID's don't count? Because our grade schools and colleges are chock-full of non-citizens, all of whom have ID's. And no shit a Passport counts for more than a school ID. Wtf are you smoking? Can I have some? I'm all for a good smoke if it makes me that f*cking retarded.</comment>

<comment>Democrats don't have the power to effect changes. And because of disenfranchisement of Democratic-leaning voters AND with the connivance of the Supreme Court, that is essentially what we'll have for at least another 15 years, after white conservatives are simply too small a demographic to retain control of the majority.</comment>

<comment>Got it. Democrats will sit on their butts for 20 years and then the magic of demography will usher in a liberal utopia. And meanwhile, the GOP will continue to push their economic, social and foreign policy agendas.Everything about your theory is false. Over the past 40 years, as America became less white it became more economically right-wing, to the point where Eisenhower would now be considered a socialist and Obama is to the right of Nixon. Our military budget blew up, our foreign policy moved far, far in the direction of "intervention for the sale of intervention" police power, the "War on Drugs" and the security state increased, to the point where these are bipartisan policies (even as non-whites became the majority among hard Dem voters). And now, people are finally talking about left-leaning economic policies for the first time since Johnson, and it's Trump. It's the right. They're calling for New-Deal-style policies (with a huge side of racism and xenophobia). And the Democrats are stunned by this development, and now they're watching helplessly as the well-being of the poor is separated from the well-being of minorities, and that will screw everyone, destroy the left and destroy America.</comment>

<comment>The best thing about the Internet is that I don't have to pay attention to anonymous voices who just wander in to spout their thoughts.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Have a certified copy of your birth certificate? What do you mean you don’t, and you were born several states away? Once you can get it to prove your birthright and make your way to the DMV during their hours to get the approved government-picture ID we’ll let you vote.And don’t complain to me how you have to show up, in person, at the county courthouse where you were born--with approved ID--to get that certified copy (What with identify theft and all you’d be surprised how hard it’s become to get that original, certified copy that’s needed.) Taking the time off from work to travel there and pay your way isn’t that big an issue for real Americans.</comment>

<comment>Can't tell if you're agreeing with me, or just being sarcastic, lol</comment>

<comment>Sarcasm. Some variant of Poe’s Law in action, I suspect.I'll contend that if the requirements for voter ID impacted numbers of middle-aged and older white voters the requirements would disappear faster than last week’s snowfall. If people in my Dad’s assisted living facility had to produce a valid, current ID from the DMV with their current address to vote there’d be an uprising. In the last election when a number of them couldn’t vote in the local precinct the facility was bussing them to because THEY HADN’T BOTHERED TO REGISTER TO VOTE THERE (no ID required--BUT YOU HAVE TO BE REGISTERED!) the wailing was awe-inspiring, and the complaints that the facility wasn’t rounding up emergency transport to carry them over a five-county area so they could vote where they had previously been registered (even though voting in a precinct where you don't live is illegal) were amazing.</comment>

<comment>And? Old white people too stupid, lazy, old, unfortunate, or all of the above, to even register correctly, shouldn't be able to vote. If it comes to the point where they need an ID, and don't get one, they shouldn't be able to vote.At the Constitutional level, something like, "The right of citizens of the United States..." is used to preface the right of voting. If you can't prove you are a citizen, you don't have the right to vote. We'll help you out the best we can, but damn, ID theft is rampant in this country, and the results of elections are important. And have you ever head of Tammany Hall? Voter fraud has history in this country. In many districts, all you need to vote is have the head election official vouch for you. You don't even have to go to the second page of google to find stories about all sorts of abuse. Double registrations, stuffed ballot boxes, shady dealings, bussing- and by white people at that.Having an ID just makes sense. And Lifelock, they do work.</comment>

<comment>Except somehow, strangely, the laws passed to date seem to only impact minorities in significant numbers. And somehow, when my state legislature proposed a voter ID law they exempted elderly residents of assisted living facilities and nursing homes from needing a government-issued photo ID (driver’s license or military ID) (the driver’s license that wasn’t available in 9 counties and could only be obtained one or two days of a week in 22 additional counties, out of a total of 67 counties). For the elderly though, as a special good deal, a facility-issued ID was more than good enough. Facility or organizational (school, business) issued IDs weren’t good enough for anyone else, though. Surprising how that works. Need to take care of our valued senior citizens and all that, especially since those valued seniors swing Republican in large numbers and a Republican-dominated legislature wanted to make sure they weren’t potentially disenfranchised.I go back to my original point--if voter ID laws began to disenfranchise significant numbers of middle-aged and elderly white voters they’d be immediately overturned.</comment>

<comment>My license was revoked on a first-offense DUI, so I got a state-issued ID card. I don't really need a license where I live.I agree - I don't think it's too much to ask that people get their butt down to the post office or DMV to have their picture taken and an ID made.</comment>

<comment>Switzlerland also likes guns.</comment>

<comment>But they don't carry them around in the streets. They're sane people.</comment>

<comment>What are their demographics again?</comment>

<comment>What are Vermont's demographics?</comment>

<comment>It's not that they like guns, they require gun possession as part of their national defense effort.  The Swiss system is kind of like what the U.S. would be if we had something in the 2nd Amendment about a "well-regulated militia".  :)And BTW, while guns are relatively unregulated in Switzerland, ammunition is not. Each eligible male receives an ammunition supply, and needs to account for any that is missing.  So it is really not all that close to the unfettered access to gun use we have in the States.</comment>

<comment>I would hardly call Switzerland "multiethnic."</comment>

<comment>Switzerland is the rape capital of Europehttps://upload.wikimedia.org/w...</comment>

<comment>I don't see Switzerland on there at all.  Sweden looks bad according to that graph, though.</comment>

<comment>A lot of it has to do with how rape is defined.  As we saw in the Assange case, rape in Sweden includes consensual sex where the woman doesn't know a condom was not used.</comment>

<comment>I know nothing of Swiss or Swedish rape law.  I do know that Joe made a claim that Switzerland is the rape capital of Europe and then cited a graph that didn't include Switzerland on it.</comment>

<comment>Categorically not true. http://gawker.com/5714896/leak...But you keep on with that MRA victim narrative.</comment>

<comment>Even if you accept the Gawker version as completely accurate, the sex appears to be consensual except for the condom usage or lack therof, and the woman doesn't seem to know with any certainty what happened with that.</comment>

<comment>Where has it been tried previously?  The problem isn't multiethnicity.  The problem is lack of common/shared culture.  What is the "American" culture?</comment>

<comment>We used to have one. We used to talk about "the American way". That was all destroyed in the 1970's as we shifted to liberal immigration, free trade, and identity politics took over.That is also when wealth inequality kicked in.</comment>

<comment>You don't know much about US history or immigration history do you?</comment>

<comment>"American culture" has always been a mish-mash of cultures from other countries. Also, a static culture is a dying culture.</comment>

<comment>What is the "American" culture?The American culture manifests itself in its ARTS, Jazz, various pop genres, broadway and orchestral. It's also in dance; Tap, Modern contemporary...etcVisual arts, drawings, paintings advertizing, propaganda, comics, graphic/digital arts.American Literature Twain, Faulkner, Ellison, Hurston, Tennesee Williams, Hawthorne, Roth... etcOur sports and the games we watch and our level of fanaticism to the teams.POLITICAL SYSTEM, our brand of democracy replete with voter procedure, protests, demonstrations, riots, etc, as well as our particular brand of justice system.FOOD- our various delecacies and food prep techniques.ARCHITECTURE/DESIGN our relationship/pride/disdain to our buildings, monuments, automobiles, house style and road/highway design.Our various attatchments to RELIGIOUS organizations and religions in general.Our evolving version of EnglishFOREGIN OUTLOOK Our level of xenophobia or lack thereof plus our particular level of respect or lack thereof for other countries and other countries.DIVERSITY- the fact that almost every group immigrant/slave/itenerant group has added to and enhanced our culture in all of the above.</comment>

<comment>Our evolving version of English, e.g., "I'ma let you finish..."</comment>

<comment>Oh so much much more than that.</comment>

<comment>Are you kidding? It's the dominant global culture at this point. Some combination of independence, Horatio Alger, worth as defined my money, and of the musical styles, comedy styles, films or TV shows that the US has created over the past 100 years and exported around the globe, icons like pioneers, farmers, ranchers, David and Goliath.It's a hell of a lot easier to point to than trying to define French or Australian culture.</comment>

<comment>India--second largest country in the worldThe USEnglandBut beyond that many countries which no look to be uniform were multiethnic, because differences that now don't seem to matter were subsumed under an national imaginary</comment>

<comment>Most countries with multi ethnicities have internal strife. There will always be some resentment from the majority to the loss of their authority and some xenophobia of becoming subservient to another race / religion / culture / etc.</comment>

<comment>It's actually the opposite. The most successful societies (Rome, London, ancient Egypt) have many ethnicities/cultures because they expand rapidly and people from all over move to that culture. Success attracts success. It's when places turn inwards and xenophobic that they run into trouble.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Canada was an English nation until the French part got tired of being second class citizens. The only reason that itra rivalry has been cooled any is because they are now molding Canada as muti-ethnic.England has a lot of strife between its white population and the Caribbean and East Indian immigrants.Belgium is rumbling between its French (Flemish) and Dutch (Walloon) factions.Yugoslavia broke into a half dozen countries.Czechoslovakia broke up (amiably) into the Czech Republic and Slovakia.Indonesia has rebellion constantly from their disenfranchised minorities.Until recently, London has always been uniform Anglo Saxon.Ancient Egypt had to enslave all outsiders.  Rome and Egypt had several eras so it is difficult to determine which you refer to.</comment>

<comment>Actually, no. Medieval London, in particular, contained immigrants from Flanders, Germany, Scandinavia, Southern Europe, the Hugenots (as refugees), as well as some North Africans, Middle Easterners and northern Indians. There were Catholics and Jews, and a few Eastern Orthodox as well. Many were merchants.Even in present-day America, people migrate from small towns to big cities, which contain significant immigrant populations, because these areas are the most dynamic and prosperous and offer the most social mobility and economic opportunity. And in Canada, the English and the French have lived side-by-side for centuries and there have been constant tensions, whereas Asian and Eastern European immigrants have historically gotten along with the native-born population very well.</comment>

<comment>As I wrote, until recently, London has been uniformly Anglo-Saxons. England was never a primary destination for refugees. Yes, there has always been some refugees, but the Channel has acted as an effective barrier. Most Hugenaut refugees went to Switzerland and the Germanic States. Only those with money could afford to escape to England.You don't know Canada.</comment>

<comment>Whatever you want to tell yourself. Yes, the head tax and internment camps. But in the second half of this century immigrants have assimilated very well. The main ethnic tensions comes from the French and the First Nations.</comment>

<comment>India and Pakistan had a messy divorce. Plenty of ethnic and religious tensions in India today.Scotland nearly left the UK last year. A large minority of Northern Ireland have a long standing desire to leave the UK.Ask the First Nations and black folks how they feel about the US.You have a wide strike zone for success. To be fair, mine is probably a little too narrow. </comment>

<comment>Nowhere.</comment>

<comment>There is always a dominant 'in group' and a minority 'out group'.Current white anxiety is based on the very credible belief that they are headed toward 'out group' status.</comment>

<comment>Well not credible so much as bat... insane but yes that...and just for the record many have been saying that since before the Civil War.</comment>

<comment>So you believe white people will be the dominant in group as a minority?</comment>

<comment>You think that not being dominant is the same as being "out"?</comment>

<comment>Are you familiar with the Herrenvolk system of democracy?</comment>

<comment>Vaguely. Similar to the US pre Civil Rights yes?</comment>

<comment>From wikipedia:  "Herrenvolk democracy is a system of government in which only the majority ethnic group participates in government, while minority groups are disenfranchised."While minorities in this country have been historically discriminated against, they still participate in the political system.  That means we aren't a Herrenvolk style democracy.I am a little unclear why you brought this up.  Are you saying that we should become a Herrenvolk democracy?</comment>

<comment>Whites managed that in South Africa for several decades, but it required a brutal system of segregation and disenfranchisement of the majority population.As much as i think the US deserves criticism for our treatment of black citizens, I hope that our system is fairer than Apartheid was. And I hope we can continue working to improve it peacefully.</comment>

<comment>And what exactly is the problem with whites no longer being the majority?</comment>

<comment>See:Chad.Venezuela.Compare to Switzerland.</comment>

<comment>Wow... went the full Jared Taylor did we JohnJ?</comment>

<comment>Plenty of numerically-minotity communities have been dominant.And the definition of "white" constantly changes. It used to exclude Jews, Southern and Eastern Europeans. Now it doesn't. Throughout Western history it included Middle Easterners, Northern Indians and North Africans. That's changing now. There is no logical reason why being half white and half Chinese makes you Chinese. But being half black and half anything else (or even a quarter black) makes you black.There's also no logical reasons that black immigrants should identify with black native-borns, any more than there is than you could take a white person with the last name Seminovich, drop them into Russia, and expect them to be comfortable. European history is loaded with ethnic strife, even though everyone there was white. (Same with African and Asian history).</comment>

<comment>African immigrants often get offended if they are mistaken for African-Americans and tend to view A-As as wild and uneducated.</comment>

<comment>What? With all our "white privilege"?</comment>

<comment>Don't have to look far really. Canada!</comment>

<comment>Canada doesn't have a dominant ethnic group?Tell that to the Québécois and First Nations.</comment>

<comment>Made no claim in that regard but it is both successful and multicultural/ethnic.</comment>

<comment>It's not multiethnic. There is a dominant ethnicity and several minor ones.</comment>

<comment>Hence multi- ie. more than one.</comment>

<comment>Being multi-ethnic doesn't mean that you have a society that is equally divided up between different ethnic groups.  It just means that multiple ethnicities exist within a country and that the minority groups aren't being actively suppressed or expunged by the majority.  Basically, they are supposed to try and get along.  That is what Canada tries to do, more or less.</comment>

<comment>It most certainly is multi-ethnic and has been from day 1. This fact is ingrained right into the constitution of the country as a matter of fact. It has always had the English and the French and if you don't understand that about Canada, you don't understand Canada period.</comment>

<comment>Canada also requires everyone to produce a provincial, Federal, or Tribal Council ID in order to vote!</comment>

<comment>"Is a multiethnic democracy possible?" Actually, Kenya is an example of a very diverse democracy that works, kind of. Well, maybe not all the time, but the difference between Kenya and the US in terms of politics is shrinkingly small</comment>

<comment>Yeah. My definition of successful is probably too narrow. I'm more of a pluralist than a multiculturalist.</comment>

<comment>So you have concluded that the US is not a successful democracy? What does success look like to you? If near perfection is the answer, the answer to your question is no system of government will be successful. </comment>

<comment>Plenty of places. Generally the first step is to ditch antiquated first past the post systems and implement some form of proportional representation. If each State elected their Representatives at large and divided them according to the proportion of vote received, there would be no more gridlock in Congress, people's votes would matter (no safe districts), and many of the voices that are silenced today (Libertarians, Socialists, Greens, etc.) would be heard.</comment>

<comment>Gridlock isn't always a bad thing.</comment>

<comment>It generally is a bad thing.  It prevents our government from providing essential services to the public.  It prevents our nation from responding quickly and effectively to threats.</comment>

<comment>Which essential services are not currently being provided?  What threats are not being responded to?Note:  Both "essential services" and "threats" are matters of opinion.  Your opinion does not necessarily equate to fact.  Nor does mine, for that matter.</comment>

<comment>Instead of "proportional" representation, I want instant run off or Australian voting, where voters indicate their first through Nth choice for each office.</comment>

<comment>The total "non-European" citizenry of Switzerland is less than 16%. Of those only 4% are of African origin. The US is FAR more racially diverse than Switzerland, with well more than 50% of "non-white" racial origins. A multi-ethnic society is a VERY hard thing to integrate peacefully, just from the standpoint of different cultural practices.</comment>

<comment>As many progressives have noted, the United States is starting to look like a democracy ruled by billionaires. Ironically, many of Donald Trump’s supporters agree.Now, is that ironic because they agree with progressives, or because their silver bullet to the rule of billionaires is another billionaire?</comment>

<comment>Can it be both?</comment>

<comment>It's only ruled by billionaires if you're lazy and dumb enough to be influenced by billionaires.  If you inform yourself instead of relying on what the SuperPAC commercials and slanted news outlets tell you to do you can make your own decisions and actively participate in the government process.  If everyone did this, then billionaires wouldn't be a problem.</comment>

<comment>Well, communism could work if everyone spontaneously gave up their individual desires and worked for the common good.  This never happens, so communism is a spectacular failure.Any system that requires nearly everyone to spontaneously change their thoughts and behaviors is just not realistic.</comment>

<comment>If asking people to actually be informed about the politics and system of governance to which they belong is such a crazy idea and "just not realistic," then we're already done for.</comment>

<comment>Cut out the middlemen and save money.</comment>

<comment>It is very difficult to understand legislation that fixes a problem that doesn't exist without considering the discriminatory effects of that legislation.</comment>

<comment>An ID is required to receive government benefits, to acquire a marriage certificate, to purchase a firearm, and to open a bank account. Are any of those things so vastly inferior to voting as to not be discrimination as well? It seems like a double standard that voter ID is attacked, but not any of those areas - some of which you could easily make a case are also very fundamental rights. (Note that my personal opinion is that voter ID is totally reasonable, and that there should be programs in place to ensure the wide and equal access to photo ID, which as noted above is critical in many basic aspects of modern life.)</comment>

<comment>Indiana solved that problem by assisting citizens to get the ID necessary to vote. South Carolina's law doesn't.</comment>

<comment>Ding Ding Ding. We have a winner.</comment>

<comment>Yea no shit. Why doesn't every state get their people a damned ID?</comment>

<comment>This is what makes Texas -which started closing its DMV offices and making it more difficult to get licences- look suspect. The other thing which makes many ststes look suspect is that most of these states did the change within days of the gutting of that provision of the votor rights law even though there is no evidence supporting large scale or even small scale votor fraud.</comment>

<comment>And we should never discuss these issues without mentioning states that restrict or cancel early voting days -- or refuse to consider alternate methods like vote-by-mail -- and closing polling stations in certain areas so that it's much harder for many people to cast a ballot even if they have an ID!</comment>

<comment>As I understand it, Alabama (surprised anyone? I thought not) has done the same.</comment>

<comment>I believe it's my mistake. Alabama, not Texas. thanks</comment>

<comment>I can't help but feel that part of the problem was that the Voting Rights Act only applied to specific states in order to address a specific problem. If it had applied to the whole nation as a matter of common sense, it wouldn't have been so easy to convince even a conservative Supreme Court that the issue had been resolved and the act no longer required.</comment>

<comment>But the northern states didn't have legal segregation, and statistics didn't show voter suppression in the northern states. The act addressed the problem where it existed</comment>

<comment>There was legal segregation in the North. It was just seg-lite.</comment>

<comment>And now mostly Northern justices--only Thomas is from the South--have said there is no longer a problem to be addressed. Federal laws should address the whole nation and should be intended to function in perpetuity. To do otherwise is to open the door for strange disparities and long-lasting resentment. Furthermore, now that the South is free to do as it wishes again under the guise of race-neutral laws, how long before it spreads beyond the South?</comment>

<comment>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 did place restrictions on those states that had the most egregious voting laws on their books - the Old Confederacy states.  That federal action was warranted and justified.This nation has become even more polarized today, politically, than it was in 1965.  Lifting federal oversight over the racist Southern State Houses, opened the door for these unrepentant states to return to Jim Crow and white supremacy.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Within days in some cases.</comment>

<comment>It was absolutely predictable... how could Clarence Thomas sell his people out like that and still look himself in the mirror?</comment>

<comment>I recently read a poll which says that he is the single most hated political person in the US amongst black citizens. Even more than Alan West, Alan Keyes, Limbaugh, Reagan or W.I know this is true for me and most people I know.He gives ole Uncle Tom a bad name. He's Uncle Ruckus.</comment>

<comment>It's good to see that a lot of his supporters now realize that the man was and remains a phony baloney.The Atlantic ought to do a story on all that?</comment>

<comment>His people? What the f_ck "his people" supposed to mean?Fellow judges?Fellow Georgians?Yale alumni?Negroes?Who are"his people"?Twit.</comment>

<comment>At the time, the problem was confined to the former Confederacy. In hindsight, it may have been wiser to be more encompassing, but that should not be a barrier. Congress may enact legislation on Native Americans that would have no effect on those living in Rhode Island or Delaware.The XVth Amendment gives Congress the authority to enforce the Amendment. It doesn't specify how.</comment>

<comment>Race is not a real thing. What you people are is racist. You want to label people by race which means you are a racist. What you are ignoring is the real issue which is ideas and culture.</comment>

<comment>Race is a social concept, not a biological concept, but that doesn't mean it's not real.  Slavery and discrimination based on race were and are real things.  It's reasonable, and in fact necessary, to take this into account when crafting public policy, especially when attempts are made to restrict voting rights.</comment>

<comment>Race is biological and real. Nevertheless, people are equal before God and ought to be equal before the law.</comment>

<comment>Find credible published scientific research on the biological basis of race and come back here and cite it.We won't ever have to read your idiocy again.</comment>

<comment>Really, so a flat nose, dark skin and curly hair are a "social concept"?  Then so is a small nose, milky white skin and straight, blond hair.You must be a recent graduate of an "institution of higher learning" in the United States.</comment>

<comment>If you cannot understand that "who is white" has been a constantly evolving social construct since the beginning of the United States - if you are not aware that Irish, Italians, Jews, Germans, and Poles were once "not white" - I doubt whether you have graduated from any institution of learning in the United States.</comment>

<comment>I agree, however it may have been hard to pass a law in the face of resistance of a great deal more states in that case?</comment>

<comment>Get ya Jim Crow on!</comment>

<comment>If you don't like voter ID, maybe you should jump the border into Mexico and try to vote there.</comment>

<comment>Or move to new york.</comment>

<comment>Or move to anywhere in the EU. To vote in almost all Western democracies, you must be registered in advance and show government-issued picture ID. The only exception I'm aware of is SOME US states.</comment>

<comment>President Obama just passed an order that employers with 100 or more employees have to label their employees by race and gender. I don't hear progressives or liberals howling about that either!President Obama believes that race is a real thing. Let that sink in. He is using his power to reenforce the idea that there are races. There is NO scientific evidence for race. None. Its like denying climate change. Its like denying evolution. Yet here is the progressive hero labeling most of the nation by race and liberals cheer. </comment>

<comment>Get ya race redistribution on!</comment>

<comment>Actually there is scientific evidence for races. Scientists refer to them as population groups, race being a fairly accurate folk categorization of a population group.</comment>

<comment>Voter ID = Jim Crow. Maybe Jim Crow wasn't so bad, then? Ah! Thank you for the history lesson, the Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>Get your attack you for being off message on!</comment>

<comment>But I'll put it this way,that Black woman has voted for White liberals for 50 years.And she deserves some answers.</comment>

<comment>The author didn't mention it, but I will: Clarence Thomas voted with the majority in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in Shelby v. Holder—which gutted Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act.You gotta hand it to the Bush family, they knew a race traitor when they saw one; Clarence Thomas is still working on the Bush Plantation.</comment>

<comment>"...a race traitor..."Dont blame it on race.That makes you stink.</comment>

<comment>A black man voting for a return to Jim Crow, as a valid  "states rights" issue is beyond ironic, Thomas has demonstrated that he is indeed a traitor to his race.This racial turncoat enjoyed overwhelming support from black folks during his turbulent  confirmation hearings; this is how he repaid his people... a knife in the back.</comment>

<comment>Dont flatter yourself,States rights are not about you.</comment>

<comment>States rights and human rights are two distinct items.Historically, states rights arguments have been used to justify horrific abuses of human rights.Federal legislation, not state legislation, has advanced human rights in the USA.  If given the chance, the states will regress back into undemocratic governance.  NC proves that is the case... the rest of the Old Confederacy will follow that shameful lead.</comment>

<comment>"Historically, states rights arguments have been used to justify horrific abuses of human rights."Have they?</comment>

<comment>Have you read the Confederate Constitution?  Here it is:http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19t...Use your "find on page" function to locate: "African Negro slaves", "slaves" and "slavery".As I said, historically, states rights arguments have been used to justify horrific abuses of human rights.</comment>

<comment>So liberal state legislation in places like California doesn't advance human rights? Interesting.</comment>

<comment>When it comes to protecting  human rights, state laws can be more strict than the federal statutes, but not less strict.Some states, like CA and NY,  are champions of human rights, other states, like NC, prefer using "states rights" as justification for dragging their feet on this issue.</comment>

<comment>You'll be a big states rights fan under President Rubio.</comment>

<comment>I live near the Canadian border, on Lake Ontario.  I have my inner-tube raft ready, just in case.</comment>

<comment>If Rubio wins I might just poke a fork in it  LOL</comment>

<comment>Some of us saw him at the time for what he was. His career arc gave it away.</comment>

<comment>The pubic hair on the Coke can was also quite revealing.</comment>

<comment>Just call him an Uncle Tom you racist moron.You know you are dying to.</comment>

<comment>If Clarence Thomas is a race traitor, what are white liberals?</comment>

<comment>White liberals.</comment>

<comment>Mmm Hmm</comment>

<comment>How in your mind are white liberals, race traitors? Liberal policies help white people too.</comment>

<comment>I really don't believe in the term race traitor. I wouldn't even normally use it, but I did here to call out a liberal for using it. I'm not really going to get into it with anyone else.</comment>

<comment>Race traitors have always been a part of human culture.Today,  any Jew who questions the wisdom and efficacy of Zionism, is routinely referred to as a, "self-hating Jew".Considering their stands on immigration, one could accuse Cruz and Rubio of being, "self-hating Latinos".Considering his votes to gut the Civil Rights legislation of the Great Society programs, Clarence Thomas is arguably a self-hating Negro.</comment>

<comment>Just plain traitors?</comment>

<comment>The GOP kinda gives the game away by being steadfastly opposed to any innovation that makes it easier to vote while maintain "security." The love absentee ballots... unless everyone can cast them like in Oregon.</comment>

<comment>It's funny how making it harder for the stupid and incompetent to vote seems to target Democrats most. I thought the media blasted 24/7 that the Republicans are the stupid party!</comment>

<comment>Enough with the "Voter ID = Jim Crow" bull$hit. You have to show an ID for just about everything else in this country from boarding a plane to buying a gun and ID requirements are standard in most every part of the world.</comment>

<comment>This NC law is an attempt to suppress the black vote; it's Jimmy Crow... in a 3-piece suit.</comment>

<comment>So you say north carolina?</comment>

<comment>NC = North Carolina.</comment>

<comment>Why was black turnout higher than white turnout in 2014?</comment>

<comment>Wrong question. the question is how many people couldn't vote or how many people found it difficult to vote versus in the past.</comment>

<comment>Black turnout goes up after I.D. laws are passed. They apparently aren't as helpless as white liberals imagine.I do get the meme.  HRC needs black turnout, and what better way than to go back to the "voter suppression" canard.</comment>

<comment>ok how many?</comment>

<comment>It wasn't.</comment>

<comment>http://politicalticker.blogs.c...</comment>

<comment>You said 2014, not 2012. Black turnout was not higher in 2014.</comment>

<comment>Ah, typo.</comment>

<comment>Because there was a black candidate.</comment>

<comment>Not in 2014. That was a midterm year. </comment>

<comment>I think the original poster corrected his first statement to say he meant "2012."</comment>

<comment>The time for proof is during registration.</comment>

<comment>How dumb.  The time for proof is when you are at the polls.  Anybody could be carrying a copy of your voter ID with them.  It is the picture that counts.</comment>

<comment>How dumb there are no credible accounts of large scale or even small scale votor fraud.</comment>

<comment>"How dumb is it that there are..." or "how come there are...".  You lost me on which one you were aiming form.  That said you did pretty great for a Zinjanthropus!  I am impressed.</comment>

<comment>LOL I missed a period  "How dumb. There are..." I was mimmicking your post...poorly.There may be minute scale voter fraud but not a critical amount that warrants new policy."Which one I was aiming form?" "which one I was aiming from?" You lost me as well, but then again, me Zinjanthropus.</comment>

<comment>Even if there minute voter fraud voting is a pretty important part of government.  I say lock it down.</comment>

<comment>For generations the biggest problem our democracy has is that people don't vote at all and the solution to increased participation isn't "let's make participation more difficult" - Odd that we're willing to do things that make it easier for desirable voters to cast ballots (pre-voting for those who can't break away from their high-powered jobs during polling hours -- absentee ballots that benefit, yes our brave fighting men and women, but that mostly benefit wealthy retirees and vacationers) But  we are busy building obstacles for others. Please tell me - when Millie sends in her pre-vote from Rounding-Third Manor in Boca Raton, who's checking her ID? </comment>

<comment>Maybe. But that requirement was watered down or eliminated by Federal "Motor-Voter" laws that required states to ask everyone who applied for a driver's license if they wanted to register to vote. And then letting everyone who asked register, with no more proof of identity or citizenship than was required in each state for a driver's license.  Also with no provision for automatic updates provided to other-state election officials when a person changed residences and therefore both their license and voter registration. Many "snowbirds" now vote both in their retirement residence and vote absentee in their pre-retirement location. Some of them even brag about it around the condo club house pool! </comment>

<comment>Perhaps where you live, But here in Michigan, each person who registers' name has to be submitted to the Qualified Voter File system. https://www.michigan.gov/docum...This is why you don't immediately get a voter's card. It's mailed to you after the QVF process.Re-your snowbird anecdote; If only everything people brag about were true. This should be easy to check and discover, no?</comment>

<comment>I actually do live in Michigan.  The requirements to prove citizenship for voter registration were initially watered down quite significantly when the state lost an appeal over Motor Voter, and were tightened back up slightly after 9/11.</comment>

<comment>A photo ID is also required for every legit job in America, any type of banking (having a checking account etc), getting a hotel room, and signing up for social services. In the modern era, it's a basic necessity of responsible citizenship and is easy and cheap to acquire.I really wonder about the argument that African Americans are so uniquely and overwhelmingly uninterested in the basics of a modern economy that this represents voter suppression. I don't think it's true. In fact, I think it's a racist claim on par with those who claim a genetic IQ difference. The only possible reason to push this lie is that it enables voter fraud.</comment>

<comment>Voter fraud?  That's an unsubstantiated right-wing canard.  This NC voter law is a solution in search of a problem.  We heard the "good reasons", it's not difficult to decipher the "real reasons" for this attempt to suppress the black vote in NC.</comment>

<comment>There is TONS of voter fraud across the country . In Chicago where I live and Worked for the Daley Machine voter fraud happens in EVERY election . It is common in every big city controlled by democrats .</comment>

<comment>I am not going to defend Mayor Daley's regime.Do you have a shred of credible evidence to back up your allegation that voter fraud happens in EVERY election... and that voter fraud is a big-city Democratic conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>Yes I have participated in it myself . Over the years hundreds of times as a poll worker .The mayor use to send out bulletins on what percentage of votes was expected for each candidate the machine was backing .</comment>

<comment>How about the 6/6 coin tosses for your boy Bernie.?Do you honestly think people who spend hundreds of millions on these campaigns wouldn't cheat? </comment>

<comment>hence the W selection in 2000.</comment>

<comment>And yet you still claim there is no voter fraud...</comment>

<comment>Geesh are you paying attention to what you're posting?</comment>

<comment>Write this down: I don't believe that African Americans go without photo ID at rates any different from any other race.The false claim that African Americans in general don't have ID- a basic tool of responsible life - is racist. Any of the tiny slivers of any population segment that doesn't have ID needs to be addressed by getting them ID. Otherwise they have no opportunity.Why are you making false racist claims in order to oppose a minimal requirement for voting? Why are you suppressing economic opportunity for the tiny minority of African Americans who don't have ID by encouraging them not to get ID?</comment>

<comment>Have to show ID to get a fishing license.Need one to get a library card.Can't join Sam'sClub w/o a picture ID.Try cashing a check. It ask someone to have an ID before voting for a person to represent them and...raaaaacist!</comment>

<comment>I don't really actively support voter ID laws because I think the myth of widespread voter fraud is just that: a myth.  Yet at the same time, I am left wondering how these mystery hordes who apparently have no ID can even function in modern society with no ID. Is this not in an of itself a problem?  How can these people have jobs? How can they drive?  Heck, how can they buy beer?  If people are really concerned about this, it seems some momentum to help poor people actually get IDs is in order.</comment>

<comment>In a few large cities, you don't need to drive. In rural areas, if you don't have a car, you don't drive.</comment>

<comment>I'm just using it as one example.  There are dozens of other things you need an ID for.I also have to admit I'm not seeing the disconnect.  I work in a public library where you have to show an ID to get on the computers.  We get hordes of low income minorities *and* white people in all day who have no problem producing IDs.  Our one homeless patron (smaller town so not many thankfully) even has an ID for god's sake.  </comment>

<comment>My mother in law's licence expired back when her 1985 Crown Victoria dies after 20 years. She gets a ride to church with a friend and the grocery store. She hasn't seen the need to renew her licence. Now, for the first time she's had to show her license to vote and she marched the streets in detroit after growing up in Mississippi for the right to vote. I know this is only anecdotal but for many of the elderly, they don't have to show id that much.</comment>

<comment>That's odd. Has your mother had the same doctor(s) for a long time in a small community?  My 80-year-old mother, who still has a driver's license but will be converting shortly to a non-driving state-issued ID, has been told repeatedly by staff members in both Florida and Michigan that no doctor's practice, pharmacy or clinic can bill Medicare or Medi-gap insurance for her treatment or medications unless she can produce a state-issued ID and let them photocopy it.  This was presented to her as an anti-Medicare-fraud measure.</comment>

<comment>No, it's a large community, but she has been going to the same doctor for decades.</comment>

<comment>The left constantly needs a civil rights struggle to stay relevant. They are the cultural bourgeoisie, constantly needing to remake themselves.</comment>

<comment>Naah, it's the same old fight. Voters rights. Didn't you read the article or at least the title?</comment>

<comment>Yeah you've clearly imbibed the koolaid. The eternal civil rights struggle will live in your useful heart until it stops beating. You're like the old horse in animal farm.</comment>

<comment>....and you're like the illiterate poster on an internet message board.</comment>

<comment>If you live in a large enough city, you don't ever need to drive and the rest is manageable as well.</comment>

<comment>You still have to have an ID for even day-to-day transactions and if you ever expect to go from one city to another. States issue photo IDs that aren't driver's licenses for this purpose. Those IDs are just as valid as a driver's license for every purpose except operating a car. They are extraordinarily easy to get - especially for the elderly who want to switch from a license to a simple photo ID.</comment>

<comment>You need three forms of identification in Michigan to get a license or state ID. The elderly lady who goes to church with my aunt had her purse stolen. The requirements at the secretary of state's office is an SS card with either two utility bills with your name on it, an old high school or college ID, an SS card, a work ID from certain places or a few select membership IDs with picture, a military ID...or a passport.She doesn't pay her utilities/lives in an apartment, has direct deposit, school/college iD was out of the question, SS card needed birth cert plus state ID. I drove her around for three days trying to construct the puzzle of getting her SS card, her State ID, her medicaid card, her birth certificate from Alabama and her ATM card. The birth certificate never came, the ATM card was the easiest.It's extremely difficult and daunting for a partially blind elderly widow.</comment>

<comment>And yet, amazingly, people in Michigan have IDs. Go figure.</comment>

<comment>The point, jeffn, is that most people do so in linear fashion from High school on gathering more forms of ID as you move through life so that a lost license isn't as difficult to replace. But when you have to start from scratch all at once due to a purse snatch, or other clamity, it is difficult.</comment>

<comment>One protection is to hang on to old expired IDFor example I'll punch a hole in an old driver's license, and hang that from my neck when running or biking and not wanting my wallet alongSince I'm not driving, I don't need the current one, but it's still legally a valid ID for purpose of identification. Some people may foolishly want to tell you otherwise. But think about it.Is that your picture ?Is that your DOB and address ?And even if it's NOT your current address, your driver ID# will be the same.In other words, it's may be expired for driving, but otherwise it's STILL government-issued ID.I have unofficial copies of key documents in secondary locations.At least with photocopies, you have proof that the documents existed and that you had possession of themThat speeds up the process of proving who you are and getting replacements.When I travelled, I used to have assorted copies of documents or expired ID stashed in different luggage.Nowadays, I have encrypted copies on my phoneAlso on the cloud.There is enough free cloud storage around fro key documents to be available anywhere, easily downloaded and decrypted.</comment>

<comment>Oh I agree whole heartedly. The state of Michigan believed that I was me from 2005 to 2011. so why can't we believe the state from 2005? but it's strange how many people, (a couple of banks) refused to accept my two years out of expiration Licence for a cash withdrawl so I caould get another license after I had lost my current one. Luckily I had a valid passport.</comment>

<comment>The way to do that is to incrementally put them in a position that is embarrassing and plain stupid.With my bank, I went in on a Saturday morning, made sure I said hello to everyone and made a deposit and withdrawal, requiring my current IDCouple of hours later, I showed up again to make a withdrawal.But this time I was in running gear with my old driver's license hanging from my neck.When I got rebuffed, I simply asked to see the manager.Explained that I was the very same person who had been in that morning for a deposit, and that the ID number of the photo ID was the same..Were they suggesting I was less of a customer ?Once the problem was resolved, I wrote a nice letter to corporate complimenting the manager for such an good solution, and suggested that they should realign their policy accordingly.Corporate balked, and gave me the same song-and-dance.So I responded that I could always go look for another bank, that had more intelligent policies that didn't make life difficult to their customers because of an ID that was not valid for driving but was still otherwise a perfectly good a legal photo ID, correctly identifying who I was.Copies sent to all people above my respondent, right up to the CEO and Chairman of the Board.Never had a problem since.</comment>

<comment>I've had my wallet stolen with my driver's license in it. Replacing it was the easiest part of what I lost.  The point I'm trying to make here is that this is a cutting off your nose to spite your face argument. Everyone rational person reading this knows that having a state-issued photo ID is about as basic to life in this or any other country as you can get. It's a minimal requirement of modern life on par with waking up in the morning. And some goof is trying to argue that an entire race can't be bothered (and that this should have no consequences). I think that argument is false and racist- because in no small part it would then be reasonable to determine that this certainly explains housing and employment discrimination.  It's entirely reasonable to review obstacles to getting an ID, it's entirely reasonable to demand that states both encourage and support getting ID. There should, for example, be a DMV van that can visit shut-ins and shelters to issue them. There is no opportunity without an ID- voting or otherwise.It is entirely unreasonable to argue that we need to accommodate the decision to have no ID.</comment>

<comment>No one is arguing that an entire race can't be bothered. They're arguing that... "Everyone rational person reading this knows that having a state-issued photo ID is about as basic to life in this or any other country as you can get. It's a minimal requirement of modern life on par with waking up in the morning" ...isn't true for everyone. It's NOT TRUE for some people and that's the point of the complaints. Not everyone lives the same life as you and your "every rational person". Some people are different, but not so different that they shouldn't vote.."I've had my wallet stolen with my driver's license in it. Replacing it was the easiest part of what I lost.  "Yes yes and as I already stated, so did I. But the Lady I mentioned had to rebuild from scratch. So no, she's different from you and from me.  No Highschool ID, No Alabama birth cert., No utilities. There are many people who don't operate within the box you've constructed for various reasons.My daughter thinks it's strange that grand-ma doesn't have an ATM card or a cell phone. Hers is both a rational concept and an incorrect one.</comment>

<comment>"Some grandmothers have difficulty pulling together the stuff for a drivers license right away" is very very different than"requiring a photo ID is suppression of black people"The latter is the context of this article. I've no doubt that some people choose to live differently than I. I've also no doubt that these choices impact other differences between us- standard of living, opportunity, housing options. The "box (I've) constructed for various reasons" is extraordinarily minimal. You might as well say: "well, Jeff, we can't expect EVERYONE to wear clothes when they leave the house." You said that you helped this lady replace stolen ID, which means she was in the state's system including a photo. This should have been a 10-minute process - compare her face to the photo on the computer screen, show the clerk her most recent Social Security or SSI or medicare or medicaid correspondence. Done. You aren't arguing that she was totally without any connection to any government agency and never, ever received any mail are you? Fix the ID access issue, don't leave her without ID.</comment>

<comment>"Some grandmothers have difficulty pulling together the stuff for a drivers license right away" is very very different than requiring a photo ID is suppression of black people" Change that to suppression of SOME people and I'd agree.My responce was to your post which said " They are extraordinarily easy to get - especially for the elderly who want to switch from a license to a simple photo ID."And I gave you an example of how  it can not be extremely easy. That was the remark of yours I was answering.This should have been a 10-minute process -...agreed, but it wasn't, I already explained a small portion of the process we underwent. They didn't have the technology, or if they did ,they didn't want to or didn't know how but this was in 2013 so perhaps it has changed since then."show the clerk her most recent Social Security or SSI or medicare or medicaid correspondence. Done. You aren't arguing that she was totally without any connection to any government agency and never, ever received any mail are you? ...."...No, but then again, with so much ID theft, they weren't about to go by some mail which could've been stolen."Fix the ID access issue, don't leave her without ID."Yes yes exactly, which is why people like me are crying foul that within days after the elimination of that portion of the VRA, many of those states immediately enacted the ID laws and Alabama closed a lot of their DMV offices.(or whatever the name) Thus making it more difficult to get IDs.</comment>

<comment>Older folks, many of whom may be in care, those too poor or too young (to buy beer etc) and the infirmed or invalid all struggle to 'fit' into or access things in the modern world many take for granted, including having a bank account, internet access, proper ID etc.  However, they still have the right to vote.</comment>

<comment>If they get ANY type of government assistance , They have ID .</comment>

<comment>If those older folks get medical care that's billed to Medicare, they are supposed to have ID.</comment>

<comment>And If they are so poor as to  not have bank accounts they need photo ID to cash their SS checks .</comment>

<comment>You are left to wonder because the experience of the bottom 20% of this country is so different from yours it is as if they were aliens living on Mars.</comment>

<comment>My daughter thinks it's so strange and stupid that her grandmother doesn't use an ATM card or a cell phone. In ten years or so we will have the same conversation when/if cell phones or ATM cards become a requirement for something important.</comment>

<comment>Undoubtedly widespread voter fraud is a myth, and these laws seem like an attempt to actually disenfranchise voters that might vote for the opposite party.But I also agree it seems pretty unbelievable that people don't have a driver's license or walker's ID for the state they live in. And it does strike me that the NAACP could use the money they are spending litigating this mess to re-enfranchise the voters that need help.</comment>

<comment>That's one of the few things they the NAACP still do and do well, the voter requirement education efforts.</comment>

<comment>That is a very interesting position for The Atlantic to take given that we currently have a two term black president occupying the White House. This position essentially assumes Americans are too racist to vote for an African American. That has already been refuted by reality.May I remind The Atlantic and this author that Jim Crow laws mandated racial discrimination in the South. The reason there were laws mandating racial discrimination is because most Southerners were not willing to do so voluntarily. </comment>

<comment>You will be taken,under the rtitious justification of me...</comment>

<comment>It might just be me but I have no idea what you wrote.</comment>

<comment>Serious question, Did you once post at tabletalk?It's got to be you.</comment>

<comment>No, I am a real person, no troll, no BS.Check my youtube channel - music art politics and theremin.</comment>

<comment>No, not saying you aren't real. It's just that your writing, political bent and grammar and the cha cha cha remind me of someone who used to post on Tabletalk.</comment>

<comment>We are legion.</comment>

<comment>I read articles like this and it makes me think that many people have no perspective on the culture war between the south and the north that persists today. Northerners tend to still believe that all the whites in the south are seriously racist, and Southerners are repulsed by the Northern "holier than thou" attitude and values such as "work work work" and "faster faster faster". There's a lot of misunderstanding between these camps, and US news and other media is making it worse and making a fortune doing it</comment>

<comment>Maybe.</comment>

<comment>In the south, most people got along and lived in close proximity. Whites and blacks would talk to each other, and they ate the same foods. sure segregation was wrong, but that was how people were brought up.in the north people kept apart. I heard the "N" word more in the north that the south.. Whites would avoid black people walking on the same sidewalk, often crossing the street.BTW - most white southerners have a little African DNA somewhere in their woodpile. And that is fine with us. i am more comfortable around black people than being around white liberals.Those who cry racism are generally the most racist of all.You generally see faults in others that are actually your own faults.</comment>

<comment>No one is holding anyone back from voting. This is so stupid.. if you have an ID you vote.. Any American should want people who vote to have an ID this is to prevent fraud and honest voting practices.  This whole thing is bull we live in different times this is the Democrats scam to get illegal votes.  If you don't have an Id you have plenty of time to get one.  If you have TIME to stand out in the cold protesting about voting, than you have time to get an ID. </comment>

<comment>"Voter fraud", and "Ballot stuffing" have been the post-election cries of losers for generations - look no further than Trump right now. Despite all the crying, I'm not aware of a single incidence of voter fraud resulting in the arrest and prosecution of anyone - anywhere - ever, and so "Voter ID fever" is right up there with the "Ban flag-burning" fever of a generation ago - at best, a solution in search of a problem but at worst, a Trojan Horse and a page from the con man's playbook -Step 1-- take a system that isn't broken- Step 2- convince people that it is --Step 3 - get yourself put in charge of "fixing" it.</comment>

<comment>WRONG Back in 2008 in Milwaukee An older Black woman voted for Obama 8 times and then went on local TV and proudly declared what she did  LOL</comment>

<comment>And the slogan in 1940's Boston used to be "Vote often and early for James Michael Curley" - but back to the present day, - had we somehow prevented this "older Black woman" from casting seven "extra" votes for Obama would we now be in McCain's second term or would the stress of passing a voter ID amendment have killed poor old John, in which case this would be the final year of Sister Sarah's first term?</comment>

<comment>...and for the first time in your life, you believed something a black woman said. because, "you know, it's on TV, it must be true."</comment>

<comment>No actually she was arrested and charged but the democrat DA would not prosecute her.</comment>

<comment>because they could find no evidence that she voted more than once?</comment>

<comment>To be fair, there really were like 65 instances of prosecuted voter fraud in Milwaukee in '08 - but almost all of them were technical violations - Common among them are individuals violating terms of their early release from prison (Paroled felons are not eligible to vote in Wisconsin) - so some poor slob parolee decides to same-day register and either never knew or forgot that he wasn't eligible and now some over-zealous Junior Assistant DA riding the white horse of election purity is grinding this poor bastard into flour and charging him with a new felony while keeping the election process safe for "good Americans like you and me"</comment>

<comment>Because "they never knew or forgot"  Haha  Good one . Just "technical "And all the assistant DA s up there are big time leftys . Their boss is infamous for the John Doe witch hunt on Walker  that found  NOTHING and wasted millions .  You don't get a job there unless you are.But heck it was just technical all 65 of them.</comment>

<comment>"How HOLLYWOOD and the MUSIC  INDUSTRY  Raised Jim Crow From the Dead" - FTFY!Or perhaps the grandsons and granddaughters of Mr. Crow.Got negative stereotypes much???</comment>

<comment>Another thing that's being left out is that in order for Jim Crow to really work, there had to also be a hefty intimidation factor along with the poll taxes and literacy tests and whatnot.  Black people didn't just fail to register to vote because the rules were onerous.  They didn't even try because in certain parts of the South (Mississippi in particular) they knew that being seen even *trying* to register could result in being fired from their job if they worked for a white person, physically assaulted, or worse.</comment>

<comment>"A far-right takeover of the state’s General Assembly in 2010 led to gerrymandered voting districts and, in 2012, a conservative win in the governor’s office."Explain this to me.1) What's "far right"?  As opposed to "right"?  Or is anyone who is not a Democrat "far right"?2) If gerrymandering was necessary for the right to win the State's General Assembly, how did the right win the General Assembly in the first place to put gerrymandering in place?3) How were the districts apportioned in the first place?  Was it gerrymandering in favor of Democrats (and don't tell me THAT doesn't happen - I live in Illinois!)?4) The Governorship of any State is a statewide election.  How does any alignment of the voting districts - gerrymandering or otherwise - lead to any party's victory in it?</comment>

<comment>Dont bother them rational  with facts . This is JIM CROW!!!!!!   Its hate time at TA .</comment>

<comment>Your daily red meat served by your host The Atlantic . Come on in  leftist and chew on some Jim Crow and spew out  all that hate that is all bundled up inside you from yesterday.</comment>

<comment>I love how "voter suppression laws" gets substituted for "voter ID laws" in the liberal press.  At times the liberals act as if they think black and Latino people are too stupid to obtain state photo ID.  Yes, it is harder for poor people to get photo ID and the states should provide a basic photo ID for voting to every citizen regardless of how remote their location is.Still if you cannot show proof that you are the person on your voter card you should not be able to vote.  Period.</comment>

<comment>This has always been the sticking point with me. What kind of screwed up system do we have were we can't even get people photo ID's?!</comment>

<comment>How is Selma Alabama now, these days year 2016?Does Selma have a prosperous local economy, successful racially integrated public schools, or Blacks and Whites living longer, safer, better lives in a post Civil Rights progressive, post racial society?Afraid the answer is a definite "no"."Here’s a brief overview of Selma in 2015:In 2015, Selma is 80 percent black and now has a black mayor, a black chief of police, a black district attorney, a black school superintendent, a majority black city council, and a majority black police force.In 2015, Selma City Schools are 97 percent black. Last year, the Alabama Department of Education’s Board of Education voted unanimously to take over Selma City Schools in the aftermath of a scathing state investigation.In 2015, fifty years after the Voting Rights Act was passed, Selma has lost a third of its population, around 10,000 White people.In 2015, 42 percent of the population of Selma lives in poverty, which is twice the state average in Alabama.In 2015, Selma is represented in the US Congress by a black woman, Rep. Terri Sewell, in the Alabama House of Representatives by a black man, State Rep. Darrio Melton, and in the Alabama Senate by a black man, nine-term incumbent State Sen. Hank Sanders.In 2015, Selma is the fourth most dangerous city in Alabama with the third highest number of murders per capita and the fourth highest number of property crimes.In 2015, Selma is struggling with code enforcement on numerous blighted, abandoned homes.In 2015, Selma is one of the worst cities in which to do business in Alabama.In 2015, Selma is an epicenter of new HIV infections in rural Alabama. The HIV infection rate in Dallas County is 106.8 percent above the national average.http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/...</comment>

<comment>Another GLARING example of how a disasterous  liberal law gets passed and the Right gets blamed for the predictable  results .</comment>

<comment>Am trying to find the majority black city or country that doesn't have the same depressing litany of statistics.</comment>

<comment>For North Carolina, this voter suppression law is a step toward modernity... this is a lot more humane than the traditional methods of suppressing the black vote: Lynchings, Cross-Burnings, the KKK and the Poll Tax.Yes indeed, Jim Crow is now James E. Crow Esquire.</comment>

<comment>alito, scalia and thomas would all be comfortably at home on taney's court.</comment>

<comment>The 3-Stooges of the SCOTUS.  "Hey, Moe!"</comment>

<comment>And you belong in a rubber room . You live in a dangerous delusional world.</comment>

<comment>So...black voter turnout > white turnout in 2012.  And, we have a two term black President.  The state of SC, the very heart of old Dixie, voted in a black Senator and an Indian governor.But, the Atlantic thinks it is forever Selma 1952.</comment>

<comment>Tokenism runs strong in the GOP... there's always a willing submissive looking for work and the GOP is hiring.</comment>

<comment>Or- perhaps the SC voters looked at the content of character instead of skin pigmentation.The race card is about all you guys have left.</comment>

<comment>We are talking about a voter suppression campaign in NC... surely, SC and the other "Confederate" states will follow suit.Hey, it's the Republican Party in the State Houses  and the Evangelical Southern Whites who are playing the well-worn race card.</comment>

<comment>You should change your name to new_york_bonehead .</comment>

<comment>Hmmm... I like that... I'll consider the suggestion.As for your screen name, limoman, I'm guessing that you drive a limo for a living.  Not well-paying, but the tips are good... driving young ladies around from one winery tasting room to the next must be a demanding job, but somebody's gotta do it.Of course, cleaning up after one of those princesses yacks in your limo must be one of the drawbacks of the profession.I salute the limo men of America!</comment>

<comment>I am retired I do it to get out of the house . I dont need the money . I was one of those investors that you and Bernie want to tax the hell out of me. So I drive my Escalade and I am  saving up a rainy day tax fund ;)</comment>

<comment>So, it's money for nuthin' and the chicks for free?  Cool!</comment>
