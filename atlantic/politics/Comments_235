<comment>So what does Bernie present to the young voters that HRC does not?  To me, they know the game is rigged, that wall street controls the country/Congress/Senate, that they have huge student loans to repay, that decent paying jobs are hard to find and have been shipped overseas, they are connected to progressive ideals and Bernie's message connects with them.  HRC's vote on Iraq and her coziness with wall street, among other things, turns them away from her, IMO.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is asking you to ignore the fact that the Clintons have been raking in millions from Wall Street for decades, while doing things to benefit their funders and not average people.You are just supposed to not think about that.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely right.</comment>

<comment>Hillary's "coziness with wallstreet" is no different than accepting bribes.I would rather not have a politician that was bought well before the election.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Wall Street is doing several separate but related things.Paying Bill for services rendered as POTUS.Paying Hillary for services rendered as Senator.Paying Hillary in advance for services to be rendered as POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Low cost, low skilled manufacturing jobs were shipped to China...they were jobs no one was willing to do for the wages provided. This is how globalization works. Why should someone be paid $15 an hour for a task that someone in China will gladly do for $1 an hour? Interestingly, Chinese manufacturing is now losing out to other regional competitors that are even lower cost.Of course, Sanders offers no solutions for these realities-- he's selling a socialist utopian fairytale of free education and universal healthcare...with no possible realistic way to pay for it. The solution, of course is to embrace globalization, continue lowering trade barriers, engage the 21st technological century with dynamism, creativity, and entrepreneurial spirit. </comment>

<comment>That's the point, why should we reward corporations who are paying horrible wages to workers in China, regardless of the min. wage here, be it $15 or $7. Large businesses will always pay less in those countries. They should not be rewarded is all, you don't get subsidies for that, you can't put your billions in offshore bank accounts, when you're already saving mass amounts of wealth by taking away jobs here and paying workers in other countries less than nothing. Do what you must for profit, but Those huge corporations are no longer going to get subsidies from the government(our tax dollars) for taking jobs away, or paying us crappy wages. That should not be rewarded by the American people. They need benefit us, or others in a way that matters, otherwise why are we helping them? It is possible to pay people a decent wage and to make sure people get the services they need. It all depends on our priorities.</comment>

<comment>Just one point.  If the Low cost, low skilled manufacturing jobs were not shipped to China, they would be here and we would have more employed individuals paying taxes on earnings and less people on welfare.</comment>

<comment>Maybe it's time to return to tariffs that increase or decrease based on the unemployment rate. For example, 5% unemployment equals a 25% tariff on imported goods or foreign labor, 10% unemployment equals a 100% tariff, full employment equals no tariff.</comment>

<comment>Bernie reminds young voters of the old uncle that came to Christmas dinner.I'm guessing that if he wins the nomination "Pull my finger" will be part of his acceptance speech at the convention.</comment>

<comment>If there's one thing that liberals and conservatives can agree on, it's that Justice Scalia is far and away the best candidate for "grumpy uncle that farts at the table on Christmas".</comment>

<comment>It's the feeling that she's unwilling to make the case for progressive/liberal/etc ideas. She's not established herself on that side of things. She's established as a "third-way" moderate, who preemptively compromises. At best she advocates incremental change, and at worst she's willing to make deals that just agree to roll back less of the advances we've already made. It's that sort of feeling - that she doesn't really believe, and that she's just saying what she thinks she has to, to get elected.</comment>

<comment>One key difference, at least going from the CNN town hall last night, Clinton sounded authentically presidential in her replies, ranging from a self awareness of the philosophical and religious facets of leadership, to sifting through the politics to maintain focus on the core issues driving long term goals (domestic and global), importance of building incrementally on past successes, all the while expanding the sustainability of those gains. Sanders sounded like a used car salesman in comparison. </comment>

<comment>And that's why people like you fall for her bullshit. Millenials can see past the surface and actually do some research. Millenials have grown up during the great recession and have heard their parents shitting all over wall street. Why would any of them vote for a smooth talking wolf in sheep's clothing who's unabashedly lined her pockets with wall street $.</comment>

<comment>She reminded me of Jeb last night. A bit uncomfortable, and unable to connect to ordinary folk, she's used to democrats splooging their pants once she get's on stage, and Bernie just through her for a loop, he just says straight up what a lot of people feel. He comes off more compassionate as well. I respect Hillary a lot, and know she's been shit on, and is a hard worker, but she has been insulated by wealth. It's like she just found out democrats were privy to the systemic economic issues of our time(money in politics, college debt etc.). Most of us can read and we have the internet!!. Anyone will tell you, follow the money. It's common sense.</comment>

<comment>You obviously watched a different town hall than I did. Hillary sounded as scripted as usual.</comment>

<comment>Totally agree. You hit the nail on the head. Get ready for the Berniebots to freak out and attack you. I'm with you all the way. We need a leader not some talker or dreamer with unrealistic promises.</comment>

<comment>It's called "vision," a philosophy of government, something that the former Secretary conspicuously lacks. When she is on stage pre-conceding the fight against the Tea Party Congress, it makes me noxious to think that she thinks she's most qualified. We need someone who understand POLITICS - as the art of the possible, yes, but also someone who understands what real leadership is about: not merely competent, pragmatic management of the status quo, but someone who can supply the vision for a popular re-orientation of the status quo, a vision that can re-configure what is possible. Our political opponents sure as Hell have got that; and when we elected Obama in 2008, we very reasonably supposed that that was what we were voting for. Alas, in Obama we got a lover, not a fighter. Well, enough is ENOUGH.</comment>

<comment>What does it mean to sound presidential? Reagan sounded "presidential". Nixon sounded "presidential". Jeb Bush sounds "presidential". Sounding "presidential" is another term for "supports the current Washington ideas".</comment>

<comment>They said that those darn Millennials would turn on Obama in 2012 because he lost his cool factor and the economy hadn't recovered enough. Then look what actually happened: http://www.politico.com/story/...Young people may love Sanders more than Clinton, but they will adore Clinton more than any creep that the GOP nominates.</comment>

<comment>Adore is the wrong word here.Tolerate would be better.</comment>

<comment>Adore clinton? Please. Let's not go overboard here.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that young people traditionally are unlikely to vote when compared with their elders.  Bernie has generated their enthusiasm and has increased their turnout.  If Hillary is the nominee they may not feel there is enough distinction between her and the creep that the Republicans nominate and many that would have voted for Bernie as the nominee may just stay home.</comment>

<comment>My point is that youth enthusiasm for Obama was noticeably down in 2012 than in 2008. In the end, however, the youth vote was decisively in Obama's favor. They didn't adore Obama anymore, but they still came out for him. With Hillary being the obvious successor to Obama's policies, there is a strong likelihood that young people will come out once again.We're still an eternity away from the actual election. Remember that in 2011, there were polls that showed that Rick Perry was going to beat Obama, lol.</comment>

<comment>I agree that we are a long way from the election and things could change.  At present I see signs of a lack of enthusiasm even hostility of youth toward Hillary.  When she made her "victory speech" in Iowa she was booed at Sanders headquarters.  That booing was probably from young people.  When reporters interview young people as reported in the New York Times for example that seems to be the attitude of youth at present.</comment>

<comment>"We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."Sounds more like Hillary or Bernie? Young voters know the difference.</comment>

<comment>People like Hillary were there to say that abolishing slavery or giving women and minorities the right to vote were unrealistic goals.</comment>

<comment>Or the "it has to be gradual, not all at once" BS.</comment>

<comment>Hillary would have called the civil rights act "unrealistic given current circumstance".</comment>

<comment>I think that politicians who are timid lack faith in us and themselves. If Clinton can't understand this, she doesn't deserve to lead us. Americans are willing to forgive a president who fights the good fight and fails occasionally, but not a fake. </comment>

<comment>The cold war is ancient history. Actually, American private industry is a world leader in Space technologies, no need for grandiose proclamations from the POTUS, the free market is doing the work.</comment>

<comment>Almost all of the Apollo project was farmed out to the defense contractors. That rush job got 3 astronauts killed. Thankfully we've since learned not to blindly trust the corporations. </comment>

<comment>The free market is doing splendidly at holding wages down for the past 30 years.</comment>

<comment>You missed the point entirely. The point being made was one of inspiration via rhetoric and toward seemingly unrealistic goals – yet ones that were not only achieved in spite of that unrealistic expectation but because that expectation was set.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, young people will vote for whoever the Dems nominate.They're as much for the 'lesser of two evils' as anyone, but for me, it'll be a symbolic vote for Bernie or an actual vote for Jill Stein if the DNC nominates Hillary.  I'd love to see young people assert their electoral power and vote en masse for Bernie in defiance of the DNC. </comment>

<comment>I hear you.  I just don't see myself voting for the Republican-Lite in a pantsuit.  She is completely compromised by Wall Street, and is in favor of endless war as her first option in Foreign Policy.  Sh!t, if I want that, I'll vote for any of the Klown Kar Kandidates.</comment>

<comment>I've met many a millennial that have voted third party, but you're right most of us will probably vote for the 'lesser of'...</comment>

<comment>Clinton's concern is less that young voters will swing red, and more that they will stay home.</comment>

<comment>If that's her concern, she needs to give them a reason not to.</comment>

<comment>And what caliber of judges do you surmise that Donald Trump or Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio will appoint?</comment>

<comment>Not as good as Jill Stein or Bernie would.</comment>

<comment>Neither Jill Stein nor Bernie Sanders will ever appoint a federal judge.  To nominate Bernie Sanders would result in a loss on the magnitude of Nixon/McGovern or Reagan/Mondale.</comment>

<comment>You vote your conscience.I'll vote mine, and my conscience will not permit me to vote for a war criminal.  Thank you.</comment>

<comment>War criminal?  Hyperbole much?Especially when your vote may help to elect an advocate of carpet bombing in the Middle East.</comment>

<comment>My vote will help elect an actual liberal, not one who pretends to be. Further, I'm not sure what else you'd call a person who supports torture, renditions, perpetual imprisonment without trial, extra-judicial assassinations, drone warfare, and unlawful spying on all American citizens but a war criminal.If the candidate you like wants my vote, they need to give me a reason to vote for them, plain and simple.</comment>

<comment>Maybe but not what is indicated at the moment.  Bernie does better in polls against specific Republican candidates than Hillary and in some cases leads them when she trails them.  Also as Bernie pointed out last night he appeals more to independents than she does.  Some of the Trump supporters have Bernie as their second choice because of their shared protest attitude whereas Hillary said one of her enemies is Republicans.  The picture may change but at the moment Bernie appears to be the stronger candidate.</comment>

<comment>Polls in February preceding a November election mean nothing.  The Republicans will savage Senator Sanders if he is nominated.  They have not done so to this point because they fear Hillary Clinton's nomination more.</comment>

<comment>You didn't read very carefully.  Read my last sentence again.  At least I gave some reasons to back up my opinion.  If Bernie is nominated time will tell.</comment>

<comment>The age gap is because the young use the internet for news.When you have access to the internet it becomes clear Hillary is a elephant in donkey's clothing.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Milennials have faces "unlined with care" and don't "carry disappointments".  How about, Milennials are burdened with debt, facing in many cases being the first generation to be worse off than their parents after years of progress, and want a candidate who speaks to that frustration, not one who thinks business as usual is a good plan?It's kind of ridiculous that young and old votes are weighted the same way.  If you're 70, the president you elect will have a minimal impact on your few remaining years unless they touch Social Security or Medicare.  If you're 25, the president you elect will affect the job market you see in 10 years, the environment your children grow up in, and the taxes you'll pay for the next 50 years.  In any equitable system votes should be proportional to youth.</comment>

<comment>Worse yet, some 40% of potential voters don't pay any income tax. That's a bad deal for those that do pay.</comment>

<comment>They do pay federal taxes however.  If they work they pay social security taxes and at a higher rate than the higher income earners because of the income ceiling on the tax.  If they drive they pay gasoline taxes.  If they use the telephone they pay a federal tax.</comment>

<comment>I'VE ALWAYS SAID PEOPLE OVER 75 SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO VOTE!</comment>

<comment>My Dad’s in an assisted living facility. When I watch them line up all of the people in their wheelchairs, people who struggle to check off menu boxes to select tomorrow’s lunch and dinner, to take them to vote I have to wonder if there’s some point the right to vote should be overridden. I don’t have an answer, but I see a definite problem.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, which is why I get so annoyed when I see some 85-year old woman say she's voting for Hillary because she wants to see a woman President in her lifetime. She doesn't have to be there to see the consequences of electing Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Which Bernie was more entertaining last night - Sanders or Madoff?</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton's Recurring Struggle to Connect With Young VotersProbably because she has a recurring struggle with telling the truth.</comment>

<comment>Where's the struggle? Tell the truth and be poor - or lie and be rich.</comment>

<comment>How does lying about dodging bullets help you to get rich?</comment>

<comment>It makes people more likely to vote for you.</comment>

<comment>Young voters have problems with candidates with baggage.</comment>

<comment>We say a lot things about younglings but these kids have really good bullshat meters inside them.</comment>

<comment>I don't necessarily think electing Obama was breaking a more profound barrier.  Look at how women are valued around the world.  Clinton went to college at a time when most women became wives and mothers.  I think we easily forget Mad Men times.  It wasn't that long ago that women didn't have the option to be educated and be leaders, much less be president.  To be anti Establishment, you need to be allowed into the Establishment in the first place, and women haven't been yet.  I think young college students don't understand the discrimination that still exists in the working world for women.  It's true that the same is true for minorities but there is no reason to rate one over the other in terms of importance.</comment>

<comment>Not all millennials are in college. Many are in their late twenties & early thirties and are in the work force facing these things daily.</comment>

<comment>Here's the thing.  I don't really believe Sanders can achieve his lofty goals.  I just think he will fight harder to push the country in the right direction than Clinton will and thus might actually succeed in doing more.</comment>

<comment>And this is why so many of us support him. Clinton has no vision for America. Imagine working towards a goal that you haven't clearly defined.</comment>

<comment>Sanders will have a Republican Congress that disagrees with much of Bernie's policy, but has no personal animosity.  Hillary Clinton has directed so much hatred at Republicans, they'll oppose her policies on general princicple.</comment>

<comment>I agree with this too.  Clinton will be Obama 2.0, except with much less of Obama's momentum and only like 25% of his charisma.  She will be stonewalled immediately and hard.</comment>

<comment>25% of his charisma?Hillary has, I believe, actually negative charisma.  She should be -25% in that department.  Which is why nobody is energized by her...Bill Clinton has all the same baggage as she does, except for the emails/Benghazi but Democrats don't care about either of those issues....but I'm pretty sure if Bill was running then the communist grandfather would be in single digits...because that's Bill Clinton.  People like him, he resonates, he has tons of charisma.</comment>

<comment>Hillary does not care about Congressional gridlock. She is being paid by Wall Street to maintain the status quo of corporate welfare and bailouts.</comment>

<comment>If there's a President Sanders, (or even a nominee Sanders), the personal animosity will develop very quickly from a Republican Congress.  When Obama was a Senator, he got along fine with his Republican colleagues working with them to propose multiple bills.  Then, as the Democratic nominee, he became the biggest threat to American democracy that Republicans had ever seen.</comment>

<comment>True, but the republicans have a 2 decade head start on hating Hillary. </comment>

<comment>EXACTLY. That's what a lot of Hillary supporters don't seem to get. We are realistic about what we think bernie would be able to (not) achieve.</comment>

<comment>And we will push back that much harder, just as you would do if a someone you opposed won the office. That's how the country rolls now.</comment>

<comment>The pundits are pretty clueless as to why young people like Bernie. I regularly hear people say it's because Bernie is promising free stuff. You have older Clinton supporters looking down on these younger people saying they're naive and clueless about how the world really works. But I'll tell you why young people prefer Bernie. First, they see a guy who isn't afraid to think big. None of these people actually think Bernie will be able to pass single payer or make college free. But the fact that he's willing to even try is what makes him appealing. Second, he comes across as far more authentic than Hillary. Young people are pretty good at spotting liars. And it helps that young people get more of their news from sources other than the corporate media. They're more aware of Hillary's ties to Wall Street and big corporations. Third, young people see Hillary as a part of a generation that is responsible for a lot of today's problems. The irony is that their hero is a guy who's even older than Hillary. Lastly, younger voters resent being told that they should vote for Hillary in order to make history. These people grew up with a black President. They don't look at Hillary as the only shot at electing a female President. They're confident that they'll see a female President in their lifetimes even if it's not Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is attracting the disaffected, misguided and poorly educated Obama youth who grew up and suffer under his failed economic policies and 1% GDP. They haven't lived under a expanding economy and pro growth policies and they are delusional in the belief that a 74 year old Socialist can change things. I agree that the Hillary is also a serial liar and also a terrible option.</comment>

<comment>There is no one smaller than HRC.</comment>

<comment>I think he's the stand-in for Elizabeth Warren, for me anyway. I'm 62 and female and don't want to vote for someone Untrustworthy. When Clinton stated in her I'm not sure if I won speech, I was checking the stats online. When she said I am a progressive, I looked up from my task, because I had never ever heard her state that about herself. It shocked me! It's now quite interesting to watch her argue about who's more progressive. Sanders is making her move to the left during the primaries, a sight to behold! </comment>

<comment>Progressives were looking for a candidate who shared their values. When Warren didn't run, Sanders saw his opening. As for Hillary, this is just another example of her political shapeshifting. She has to claim to be something she's not only because she thinks it'll help her win. And it's exactly that type of behavior that turns people off to her.</comment>

<comment>The rubber mask takes a decade off of her face.Latex is magic!</comment>

<comment>Wait--so a 70 something baby boomer grandmother who’s campaign platform is built around doing what’s practical and implementing modest changes to current policies and programs is having trouble getting 20 somethings to support her instead the idealist? Go figure.</comment>

<comment>You might have noticed that her opponent is also a 70-something Boomer.  The issue is that she doesn't stand for anything, other than "Hillary."</comment>

<comment>Sander's isnt a boomer, He's from the silent generation</comment>

<comment>Depends on which info you use. In the strictest sense, yes Clinton is a Boomer & Sanders is from the Silent generation.However, they are both kind of the cusps of those, which is always a little tricky when trying to make demographic, overarching calls.Helpful link that I use a lot when discussing generational things:http://www.cnn.com/interactive...</comment>

<comment>scum always floats to the surface...</comment>

<comment>Younger people like Bernie because like Obama he's promising them free stuff and free education. Even though its not possible to wipe out everyone student loan debt people like that Bernie is promising that even though its not realistic.</comment>

<comment>You clearly don't get it.</comment>

<comment>Grandma Sociopath is going to have to learn reaaaal quick, that the only way to my generation's heart is A LOT of free sh-t.</comment>

<comment>Before reading other comments, I have to say this is spot on for my group of millennial friends.For a grand majority of my group we want that fight, we want that tenacity that we felt we were let down by in 2009 with the beginning of the Obama administration. We wanted real progressive change, and we do understand that change is limited and incremental, but we'd like to see it incrementally move towards Sanders' vision.We're not naive. We know how this works, many of us millennials, except the very youngest have voted in a presidential election or two.Lastly, I don't see Clinton as very firm in this regard. I'm glad she has come around to progressive ideals, but really they have all come late in the game. I feel that Sanders has better judgement, even if they are mixed with lofty ideas. What is so wrong with lofty ideas?Edit: To say fight can be collaborative, involve compromise, can be diplomatic... the fight is more about clear goals in mind in my usage.</comment>

<comment>Trump's plane had to make an emergency landing today.  Trump has had the plane since 2011, nary a problem with it.  But suddenly he is on the campaign trail and it develops "problems"  -- these a little arranged justification, a precedence for what will certainly be the big, arranged Trump plane crash later that has no survivors.Most likely this sabotage will be executed by a team dispatched by Hillary's foreign allies.  Hey It worked great for the Clintons in the case of Ron Brown, back in '96.We're on to you, Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Goldman paid her $600,000 for a 3 hour speech. She lies serially. She is a relic of the 90's. Even the misguided and uninformed Obama youth know a loser when they see one!</comment>

<comment>It might help Hillary with the younger voters if she showed videos of the puplic talks she gave while a student at Yale.</comment>

<comment>The thing is that Hillary has nothing to offer ordinary Americans other than "I'm not as bad as my Republican opponent."</comment>

<comment>Hillary's position regarding foreign policy is preventing myself and the countless other University students from voting for her...she is leaps and bounds to the right of Obama and Sanders on foreign affairs. She orchestrated a horrendous military intervention of Libya, among other blunders (including but not limited to her Iraq and Afghanistan war support, her desire to establish a no-fly-zone in Syria (which Obama opposes), her desire to arm unpredictable Islamic rebel groups in Syria, and her defense of Israel's actions in Gaza). I refuse to vote for a candidate with such a morally corrupt, unrealistic foreign policy. We need a candidate that will not drain our resources and  kill 200,000 innocent people in countries of our choosing. I will not be voting for Hillary in the general election, as my conscience cannot bear the slaughter of civilians in the name of my country. Perpetual intervention and warfare is ill-conceived from not only a moral standpoint, but from an intellectual standpoint as well. Hillary would choose the consensus Hawk policies, while ignoring the advice of realists (offshore-balancing strategy, among others). The liberal interventionist consensus has fanned the flames of radical Islam, further destabilized an already unstable Middle East region, and resulted in thousands of poor and middle class American women and men dying. What benefit have we gained form our continuing world police role? End the madness. Protect our borders, engage in extensive diplomacy and international agreements, shift our focus to the real foreign threat to American interests (i.e. Russia), and move resources into intelligence gathering instead of invasion. Rant over.</comment>

<comment>It could have nothing to do with Ms. Clinton spending the better part of a decade insulting and attacking the women who came forward to claim her husband was a serial sexual assaulter and harasser.  I know Ms. Clinton really, really, really wants the narrative about Bill's assaults to be focused on his mere harassment of Monica and not his rape of Paula Jones but if you're a 21 year old woman in college, and the only story of sexual impropriety you've been hearing about is Bill's BJ from Monica, and you go looking into his history, what do you think you're going to feel about the woman who attacked all his victims?</comment>

<comment>How many more articles can be written explaining how HRC should run? My GOD .Her tone. her dress. her voice. all critiqued yet you don't see any think pieces on Bernie's disheveled style, his loud voice. UGH"Clinton risks positioning herself as the chaperone at a frat party." WOW wow wow Men are simply terrified of having a women president.</comment>

<comment>The author is afraid of progress, preferring the familiar comforts of status quo.  But the Progressive Sea Change has been stifled for too many decades.  Suck it up. Democracy coming.</comment>

<comment>Actually, you don't get it. The real reason why Hillary is going to lose is simple - it is the economy stupid. This generation is set to earn less than their parents, while paying more. The slow incremental route has been favoured by the Democratic Party for decades, and from the younger perspective that is how things got that bad - because the Democratic candidate constantly runs away from "socialism" and tries to "fix the poisonous nature of our politics".You have students who have to worry about being decades in debt - in order to earn the basic qualifications they need to get good jobs.Trying to reach middle ground and "incremental change" has failed utterly and completely. I mean FFS I'm a South African. South Africa is not a rich country, it is strictly third world.I get 4 weeks paid leave a year, the national minimum is 3. If I get sick, I get legally mandated paid sick leave.If I get a glass of water at the tap, I can drink it without worrying about lead poisoning. Our food standards were recently an issue because we actually have higher standards than yours. That is why Obama threatened to cut our trade deal with America - your meat exports did not meet our standards.And yet in my country I can buy fresh food - on a relatively poor salary.I can't say I am happy with my government , but in a lot of ways I have it better than the average person working my job would have living in say Michigan.How did Michigan get like that? How did the US get to the point where someone living in Africa can say "Hey, I have it better than you"?Incremental change, in which the Democratic candidate runs away from the label socialist, attempts to end the poisonous nature of politics, attempts to find middle ground rather than standing your ground.</comment>
