<comment>Is this the real Spudwhisperer?</comment>

<comment>He is only trying to atone for his white privileges. </comment>

<comment>That is a fallacy. The idea of white privilege is a made up term to give the perpetual victim class an outside reason for their life's mistakes so they do not have to take responsibility for their own choices.</comment>

<comment>So when will you and yours begin your atonement, we candy canes  have had it with everybody else having privilege!</comment>

<comment>Diversity is working great in St. Louis and Detroit.</comment>

<comment>Black people are misusing guns in Chicago, Baltimore, Detroit, NOLA, LA, Atlanta.   You should be proud.</comment>

<comment>They've misused government even longer, which is one reason why the people that built this Country explicitly included the right to keep and bear arms.</comment>

<comment>Just remember that your support for using the "no-fly" list as a test for gun ownership means entirely disavowing due process. I genuinely hope that no sane Americans actually want that, regardless of your stance on laws relating to firearms.</comment>

<comment>Yes it means no bras too. Don't forget that it means no bras.</comment>

<comment>Did you mean no BRASS or do you expect all women to give up their bras?  If the latter, I approve.</comment>

<comment>but it sounds so smart to say it.....</comment>

<comment>The left does not care one bit about due process, or the law. One of Obama's EO, goes agist HIPPA.</comment>

<comment>Exactly which EO goes against HIPPA(I assume Trigger's question was directed here.)</comment>

<comment>HIPPA, he is removing the privacy from, and telling doctors to report mental heath issues to law enforcement.</comment>

<comment>Exactly which EO and in what manner did it violate due process? Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Read the F'ing EO yourself.</comment>

<comment>What F'ing EO?</comment>

<comment>I did and you are fullofshit</comment>

<comment>They are already required to report potentially dangerous patients to law enforcement.</comment>

<comment>Invasion of privacy of medical records.</comment>

<comment>Exactly which EO and in what manner did it violate due process?  Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Didn't mention an EO....</comment>

<comment>“necessary to save lives and prevent criminals from obtaining weapons.”Right.  Just like outlawing drugs resulted in their complete elimination.It will not save lives either as criminals have no problem obtaining illegal guns already, and crazy people usually don't have criminal records.  Or even if they do, nothing stops them from killing law abiding gun owners and just stealing their guns, like that kid in Sandy Hook.What those laws will do instead is expand international black market in firearms in the US (so that gang bangers will use rocket launchers like they do in Mexico, rather than be happy with just stealing grandpa's handgun), and prevent people with mental health issues from seeking help they desperately need.Feeling depressed and feel like you need help?  Congratulations!  You are now in a national database!  And of course, it can never be hacked, and in our electronic records obsessed society no potential employer or insurance company will ever discriminate against you based on that.  Sucker.And if you actually enjoy hunting or shooting targets, forget about it.The legal incentives are set up in such a way that instead of seeking mental professional help you are far better off not telling anyone about your problems, and stewing in them until you blow up and murder a bunch of people in the shopping mall.</comment>

<comment>You are owing to do that soon right!  That shopping mall thing!  Guns are good for that.  More guns.</comment>

<comment>Everyone needs lots of guns.  More guns.  This makes so much sense.  What can stupid people not see that many more guns means many less killing.  Except for that shopping mall thing.  You really gonna do that?</comment>

<comment>I have no idea how many guns do different individuals 'need', and nobody else does either, except people who buy them.And no.</comment>

<comment>I need a bazooka.</comment>

<comment>You can order one from Mexico.  They have tough guns laws there.</comment>

<comment>Is your name mal because you are gonna attack the mal?</comment>

<comment>No, I'm not going to attack myself.  Self abuse is only appropriate in moderation.</comment>

<comment>Great you have no idea and that is why you posting diatribe.</comment>

<comment>I'm posting a diatribe because Gun War is another silly culture war, just like drug war, but the last thing US needs right now is millions more people in prison.  We have enough already.</comment>

<comment>So the drug war is just silly culture. While I admit some aspects are silly, do you really want to return to no restrictions on drugs? Seriously dude, how many people ripped out of their minds on heroin behind a wheel will it take before you begin to understand that drugs aren't benign.</comment>

<comment>I think you are confusing alcohol with heroin? And alcohol is legal.  If people switched to heroin they would just pass out peacefully, best for the rest of us.</comment>

<comment>Yes, people would just pass out peacefully and never wake up. Opiates are generally a respiratory suppressant. Heroin users fall asleep and stop breathing.But apparently you don't see a problem with that.</comment>

<comment>There are risks in life.  If product is properly labeled and user knows what he is getting into, it is his responsibility.  Just like skydiving, or motorbike riding.I commute on motorbike in the summer, I know perfectly well what will happen if deer crosses me on the highway.  Risks are risks.</comment>

<comment>The drug wars are run via gun industry so you are ranting.  In fact regulating importation and sale of guns which require factories is not the same as drugs unless you are addicted to killing people.Are you addicted to murder?!</comment>

<comment>What?  Drug wars are run by DEA. Stopping drug war would result in significant reduction in gun deaths too.And drugs require factories to manufacture as well, at current rates of consumption.  You can't make a ton of cocaine in your kitchen.</comment>

<comment>Nope, the  police are involved and a lot of arrests that fund the prison industry are drug arrests  ""US police departments are increasingly militarized, finds report• ACLU cites soaring use of war zone equipment and tactics• Swat teams increasingly deployed in local police raids• Seven civilians killed and 46 injured in incidents since 2010""""The Swat team that burst into the Phonesavanh’s room looking for a drug dealer had deployed a tactic commonly used by the US military in warzones, and increasingly by domestic police forces across the US. They threw an explosive device called a flashbang that is designed to distract and temporarily blind suspects to allow officers to overpower and detain them. The device had landed in Bou Bou’s cot and detonated in the baby’s face.""http://www.theguardian.com/law...</comment>

<comment>I agree with you on drugs and excessive police force when carrying out raids.</comment>

<comment>Police,  gun industry and prison industry are all clients of  illegality of drug industry</comment>

<comment>There's much truth to that, yes.</comment>

<comment>No; we are just getting started. Don't do the crime if you can't do the time. Hopefully you will be the victim of a crime soon and will 'see the light'; but I doubt it.</comment>

<comment>Lol, since violent crime rates have been dropping like a rock in US, it is less likely that i would a victim of a real crime than ever in US history.  Meanwhile, society can not afford to more people in prison than North Korea.  National output can not be maintained by retired old farts and ex cons, the only two categories of people left on a current trajectory.</comment>

<comment>It is the Bill of Rights, not the bill of wants or needs.</comment>

<comment>No, more like outlawing drugs can reduce addiction and overdoses.  It's not a cure-all; it's just a step in the right direction.</comment>

<comment>"No, more like outlawing drugs can reduce addiction and overdoses."That is a very bold statement.  I strongly doubt that this is the case, and in case of overdoses, I think the opposite is true.  Since drugs are black market, you can never be sure of purity or strength.  This leads to overdoses.Properly packaged and labeled drugs would allow users to select correct dosing, leading to reduction of overdoses.</comment>

<comment>Maybe!Or maybe legalization would result in more users and more addicts.</comment>

<comment>just when I thought you couldn't get any more stupid, you go and out do yourself! bra-vo!</comment>

<comment>I think this is unlikely, at least as far as addicts go.  More casual users maybe.There are two types of people in the world - those who can handle recreational substances, and those who can't.  Those who can are never a problem.Those who can't are the ones who get addicted, and it doesn't matter if the substance is alcohol, tobacco, pot, or heroin.  They suffer from mental health issue, and they need help, not prison.  Without help, they will do anything to get it, law or no law, prison or no prison (you can easily get drugs in prison, for a price).Basically, what I'm saying is, all available addicts are doing drugs already, and legalizing drugs is  unlikely to increase a pool of addicts.</comment>

<comment>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Well, sure, lol.  I probably should rephrase the first part of my statement.No drug has 100% addiction rate.  This means some people get addicted and some don't.  The question is:  if you legalize drugs,1.  Would more people try them than before?2.  Of those extra people currently deterred by the threat of punishment, how many would get addicted?My thinking is, if you are deterred by the fear of punishment right now, if drugs are legalized, you won't be tempted then either due to fear of negative consequences related to drug abuse.If you desire drugs strong enough to overcome fear of negative consequences of abuse, I don't see how fear of punishment would play into it either, hence current addiction epidemic (legal or illegal).If drugs are legalized, there could be reshuffling of addicts from one substance to another (like prescription drugs into heroin), but overall increase would be minor, I think.</comment>

<comment>its not that i don't understand your logic about the possible benefits of legalising drugs. Yet many different solutions are arguable and and will all make sense. More importantly, i feel like it's makes more sense to consider how realistically probable are these positive consequences in this case.my reservation about your proposed action is that we aren't talking about any undesirable substance of alcohol or even marijuana.. We are talking about hardcore drugs. with chemical effects of getting a large portion of first users to be hooked on to it. (You argued that yeah, some people don't get addicted but would you not concede that the rate that WOULD be addicted first few try is a high number. More than first time consumption of alcohol or other legalised undesirable substances)Drugs, like heroin destroys life. Even El Chapo said it himself. It's not just the price of drugs that takes away from people's lives. Its the effects of drugs too. The bad bad bad negative side effects on health, on lifestyle etc that made it so undesirable and offensive as a substance in the first place.Which is not such a bad idea for legalisation if the "addiction" part isn't so prominent. If it gives people the kick but have crazy negative side effects then legalising that might still be ok because most people in their rational state can make the equation and stay away from those harmful stuff.But the drugs are not being ABUSED because they are expensive or illegal. They are abused by addicts because its made to get people hooked on it. And how would making it more available not result in a future where a great proportion of the population in search for some spark in life (inevitably) get hooked onto it despite the bad effects?Making it legal makes it easier for them to get help, true. A lot of people will be more willing to get help, and a lot more will need to get help after legalisation, but help is not just therapy or rehabilitation facilities. Its also hospital bills for the failing liver or whatever bodily functions drugs corrupt.And in the end, if taxpayer's money being thrown to maintain the big population of drug users in jail is one of your worry when drug is illegal, then i think the tax burden to pay for people getting help for drug addiction but can't afford it is not going to be any cheaper imo. In fact, medical anything is definitely more expensive.</comment>

<comment>Well, you are going to pay for addicts either way, in prison or rehab.  But in rehab they will more likely to get help and get better, while in prison they will continue to do drugs and get their lives destroyed.</comment>

<comment>It's a guess that people in rehab are any more likely to not go back to drugs. Alot of peopl that go to rehab go back to using drugs too. The number of people needing to get help when legalised and the number of people getting thrown to jail when illegal may be very different. Possibly a very large on in the former than the latter. And you can imagine their respective impacts on govt budgets.not to mention the cost on the society of destroyed lives.</comment>

<comment>(think i forgot to post my previous reply)That is a guess, and i think a poor one. Alot of addicts go back after rehabilitation too? More importantly, the number of people needing help compared to the number of people thrown is jail will be different. The former being much greater than the latter. By pure economics.And you can expect the respective impact on govt budgets too.</comment>

<comment>I strongly doubt that.  I have no desire to try heroin.  I tried smoking when I was a kid and didn't like it.If wanted to, I'm sure I could get heroin today.  But even if it were legalized, I'm simply not interested in it.So the assumption that everybody will rush to try heroin once legalized is overblown, I think.</comment>

<comment>...why would you assume the rest of the population to be as sensible as you. You dont like smoking but exactly! Look at how many people in America are smokers today. Are they not aware of the health detriments? Nope, they are just addicted.And we arent talking about cigarettes. We are talking about hardcore heroin. You cant transpose the same logic to a substance where we know of cases of people selling their bodies and their child to get their hit. The addiction factor is too powerful and the detrimental effects on not just health but their life is just too destructive to leave it up to the general public to handle. I don't doubt that you can. But the truth is, they cant.</comment>

<comment>Well, despite highly addictive nature of smoking (no doubt about that), smoking rates are decreasing in US, to a large degree thanks to a public awareness campaign, not making smoking illegal.If public can be educated about dangers of smoking, i'm sure public can be educated about dangers of heroin too.  Horror stories about people selling their children are case in point.  I'm not against public awareness of dangers of hard drugs at all.</comment>

<comment>It's decreasing cause of public awareness instead of illegality. ofc. because smoking is not illegal. but who could guess the effect of making cigarettes illegal, maybe that would decrease smoking even more. But that would be dumb because cigarettes dont call for such strong actions.The public is aware of the dangers of heroin. They are and have been for the past 10 years. Much stronger campaigns are not going to do much in my opinion because who at this age doesn't know drugs are bad. That;s a poor mitigation to complement such a big and risky action of legalisation.And you want to equate cigarette with drugs again. How cigarettes are addictive and legal and yet it's not that big a problem. I've said it before. The reason you can't transpose the same logic is that it would very dangerous to view stuff like heroin in the same class of cigarettes or alcohol. No one sells their kids for a pack of cigs. But why do people become so compulsive with heroin. Why does their life get turned to shit and they have to become street walkers? No one does that over cigarettes.It's the too destructive and too addictive nature of heroin that makes your proposition hard to swallow. That makes the theoretic benefits hard to materialise realistically. Maybe i have too little faith in the public. But too many teenagers would accidentally waste their lives away over a few stupid mistakes.</comment>

<comment>Well, i think a big part of the reason people sell their kids for heroin and not for cigarettes is because cigarettes are legal and are therefore cheaper.  Heroin is illegal and is thus more expensive.  If you increase prices for cigarettes to heroin levels, you might see similar response.  I mean, see Eric Garner and NYC cigs taxes - we are already creating black markets and killing people over cigs.And as far as teenagers and heroin goes, they can get it illegally today anyway, but once hooked, they can't really ask for help once they get in trouble.  They risk prison time if they come out publicly.  That is a bigger worry to me.</comment>

<comment>They def can get it illegally too but the exposure to it is def different. It is possible to get anything illegal if you try hard enough, doesn't mean it has the same effect of it being made legal or that things illegal should then be made legal.Sorry, equating cigs to heroin is bizarre to me. There are glaring differences  which you dont seem to acknowledge.For you heroin can model after cigs.For me, the equation is simplistic.Let's just agree to disagree!!!</comment>

<comment>No drug has 100% addiction rate.Opiates, by their nature, are 100% addictive. Physically and psychologically addictive. Some people may be more resistant to the addiction, but everyone is.If drugs are legalized, there could be reshuffling of addicts from one substance to another (like prescription drugs into heroin), but overall increase would be minor, I think.Do you really think I would stay with my Valium when I could get Percs or even morphine?</comment>

<comment>I strongly doubt that.  I have never seen any addiction rate over 40%, and was for crystal meth of something like that.  Funny enough alcohol and tobacco had higher addiction rates than heroin from what I recall.Anyway, 100% addiction rate is pretty wild statement.</comment>

<comment>heroin is 100% addictive. The current meth on the market is close and alcohol is way down the list. Alcohol needs an addictive personality, opiates don't.Edited to addhttp://mentalhealthdaily.com/2...</comment>

<comment>Not really.  It has more like 23% lifetime dependence rate.http://marijuanapolitics.com/a...This link links to a PDF of a paper on the subject.  Tobacco is the worst at 33%.</comment>

<comment>Nope.http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2...Your article measures a different scale that isn't a measure of addiction (dependency)</comment>

<comment>Well, that ranking system doesn't show addiction rates, and if you read about what it says about newer studies, they seem to rank heroin, crack and nicotine almost the same. (2.89 vs 2.82 and 2.82).And we know nicotine/tobacco have very high addiction rates, but nowhere near 100%.</comment>

<comment>Nicotine does not have near the intoxication effect that heroin does. Nicotine is psychologically addictive in that it is cool to do which leads to repeating use. Heroin is euphoric pleasure which brings repeated use. If heroin, or any opiate, is taken long enough, it will become addictive.</comment>

<comment>Well sure, I think that's the case with most if not all drugs.  Take alcohol - if you drink too much for too long, I think you can actually die if you try to stop too fast.</comment>

<comment>Maybe!  (That wasn't the experience in this country when heroin was first manufactured (by Bayer) and was legally and widely available, but maybe things have changed in the past century.)</comment>

<comment>Well, right now we have prescription opioid abuse, which is semi-legal.  I think if heroin is legalized, addicts will shift from prescription drugs into heroin, so you will see increase in heroin addicts, but decrease in prescription pill addicts.</comment>

<comment>RantPrescription addiction burns my butt. If a patient becomes addicted to a pain reliever, the first reaction is to remove the person from the drug and leave the patient in pain. That only encourages them to search the black market for pain relief.There needs to be more effective methods of pain relief which would include the use of opiates. I'm not a physician so I can't tell you what we need to do. But there is no reason to save someone from cancer or severe injury if we allow them to suffer in pain out of fear they will become addicted.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>Heroin wasn't as much of a problem. It was opium, morphine, and cocaine that were the drugs of choice before being banned. Heroin came on the American market in 1898 and  was made a controlled drug 16 years later before being banned outright in 1925.Opium was readily available in Chinese opium dens and more so in laudanum, a potion marketed to women. Morphine was still the pain reliever of choice for severe pain. Cocaine was widely used by dentists and as a local anesthetic.</comment>

<comment>We had fewer addicts when you could buy heroin in a Montgomery Ward catalog.</comment>

<comment>Uummm, ALL prescription drugs are already labeled, yet people do become addicted.I remember a few years ago, after a surgery, why my pain medicine instructed me to take one every four hours when the relief only lasted two and a half to three hours. And you want me to adjust the dose to suit my needs? Dude, that WON"T reduce addictions, it would increase them.It is also possible that it would increase ODs as some times the drugs don't stop the pain. some illnesses, including some cancers, go past what prescriptions can treat. All one can hope for is some relief in reducing the pain, knowing it won't be relieved.100+ years ago, many people were addicted to morphine, opium, and cocaine. They were legal and sold over the counter. Many died from overdoses.There is a reason anarchy is thought to be a bad idea.</comment>

<comment>Like I said, people who become addicted will become addicted.  It is true, prescription painkillers can be addictive.But keeping people off painkillers all their lives is unrealistic - sooner or later they will try it.  At that point they will either become addicted or not.  If they won't become addicted then, the odds of them reaching for legal heroin is pretty low.And if they will, putting them in prison is not going to do them much good.</comment>

<comment>You know very little about addiction. Very little.People do not become addicted the very first time they try a drug. It takes repeated uses over a period of time. Most patients that are given opiate painkillers do not become addicted because they are only given enough to last through the pain. If they were on longer then they would develop a dependency.</comment>

<comment>Maybe.  Still, I believe that addiction is best dealt with by qualified health professionals and not prison guards and inmates.</comment>

<comment>That is a separate issue from legalizing drugs.</comment>

<comment>Nope.  That's what it is really all about.  With drugs being illegal, addicts have hard time asking for help without fear of going to prison.  Likewise, some styles of treatment are likely off the table as well, such as controlled drug use and gradual reduction.Those sorts of things need to be sorted out by health professionals without fear of prosecution.</comment>

<comment>You have been arguing that drugs should be legalized and then eff off onto a tangent about rehabilitation is better than prison. You just don't know what you are arguing.</comment>

<comment>I'm arguing that drugs should be legalized.  This will keep recreational users out of prison, a good thing.  This will also keep dependent addicts out of prison, even better thing, because now they can ask for help without fear.</comment>

<comment>possibly the single largest dumbass comment ever posted on the Atlantic. bra-vo! take a bow</comment>

<comment>So you are saying that you are addicted  to guns and need to shoot people, is that right!!</comment>

<comment>No, I'm saying that most people respond to incentives and disincentives.</comment>

<comment>Obviously they do.  But it is beyond that.  Weapons can be used to kill others while addiction leads to self harm.</comment>

<comment>Addiction harms those around the addict as well.</comment>

<comment>It does but it does not kill the non-addicts in a mass drug fart or something!!</comment>

<comment>It does.http://www.cincinnati.com/stor...</comment>

<comment>Operating motor vehicles  while under influence is illegal but not when operating guns that require no registration to even operate you clueless one</comment>

<comment>But, but, you said it doesn't kill others.</comment>

<comment>That is via a secondary item that regulated.  You can use drugs and use guns under influence of alcohol just the same.But drug addiction alone can not kill other people by itself.</comment>

<comment>Prohibition causes overdoses.</comment>

<comment>Over indulgence causes overdoses. We see many prescriptions as well as OTC drugs being overdosed.</comment>

<comment>But Prohibition directly causes them by creating a situation where product strength is unknown and wildly variable.</comment>

<comment>There are more ODs every year from using known quantities of pure drugs than there is from using smuggled drugs.In 2014 there were 47,055 drug deaths, of which included 18,893 were prescription opiates and 10,574 were illegal opiate drugs. The rest were non-opiate drugs. (I assume Xanax, tranquilizers, and other mood stabilizers) http://www.drugwarfacts.org/cm...</comment>

<comment>And illegal drugs are massively higher. Especially when you take into account how many legal drug ODs are intentional.</comment>

<comment>I will be more than happy to continue to leave loopholes in background checks if you will recognize that your argument applies equally well to drug interdiction.  Its achieving very little and creating bigger problems than what it was designed to solve.</comment>

<comment>You are correct.  I support ending the drug war.  Drug war raises profit margins for cartels, and every time DEA takes down a cartel a new cartel needs to establish its authority over territory, which fuels incredible violence.Reduce profit margins, and establish a way for organizations involved in drug trafficking to resolve their disputes via some sort of court system rather than mass murder.</comment>

<comment>Great you will be happy to leave the loopholes in background checks like gun industry is happy to leave the loopholes..</comment>

<comment>But here is the real question: There are, about 310,000,000 guns in America. More than 60% of gun ownership occurs in states with absolutely no requirement to register a firearm.  This means that more than 1,860,000 guns exist where there is no "record" of "proof of ownership."  How, then, does one regulate the sale of a gun one cannot prove an individual has?  If the government cannot prove whether I have one gun, five guns, or a hundred guns, then how can they possibly know to regulate my sale of any guns I may own? Now do the math and see how this translates out when it comes to private party sales of any gun, anywhere, at any time.  How, exactly does one regulate this function, in any meaningful way, when one cannot prove the transaction has occurred?</comment>

<comment>The gun laws can be established to effect the future purchases.  The criminals arrested with guns for a given crime would be offered lesser  period of time served leniency they identify the seller and path and location of  the sale who has to prove the he has not been involved in the sale.</comment>

<comment>First, your assertion turns American jurisprudence on its head by adopting a "guilty until proven innocent" standard.  Somehow I don't suspect that will fly.  Second, all the person (accused) has to do is to deny the gun was sold...and that it was lost or stolen.  Now what?  Third, if there is no registration, how are you going to backtrace the gun in the first place?</comment>

<comment>No, the accused are taken to the court and they have to prove their innocence just the same.You are playing games.</comment>

<comment>Nope.  The law (in America) requires the STATE prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  It doesn't require the defendant to prove anything.  And you still haven't answered the question:  How do you propose to "prove" the gun was sold when you can't "prove" ownership via a registry?  How can you prove I ever owned a gun if I am never required to register it and background check data is destroyed once the clearance to purchase is granted?</comment>

<comment>You are assuming that criminal gun salesman would never leave evidence.  If they are named, evidence can be collected.</comment>

<comment>Nope.  YOU are the one asserting that the government will "magically" discover who sold the gun to a criminal. I am simply suggesting that you demonstrate that your assertion has some basis in reality.  How, exactly will the state make such a discovery?  An unsupported assertion, by a criminal (who is making that statement in exchange for something of value) is not proof of anything.  60% of all firearms (conservatively) are not registered.  How will the government prove its assertion?  How will it regulate a transaction it can't prove has occurred?</comment>

<comment>Police can gather evidence once an individual is named.Keep posting diatribe</comment>

<comment>Ah, so it's a diatribe to ask that you prove your assertion?  If you say so.</comment>

<comment>what does that even mean! !</comment>

<comment>It's your assertion.  If you can't defend it, why should I?</comment>

<comment>So you don't know what you post</comment>

<comment>I understand my posts just fine.  YOUR reading, for comprehension, skills do seem to be lacking.  Was it NCLB or Hooked on Phonics that made you so incapable of reading colloquial American English?</comment>

<comment>No you don't.  There is no proof to be had for hypothetical case  so you are posting diatribe.  In real cases if someone is named to have to sold a weapon, evidence can be collected.  That includes other witnesses,  DNA, residues, bullets found, credit card transactions,  pictures, phone records,  any ad related to sale, IP addresses, bullet purchases, lie detector,  police line up by witnesses if the seller claims that he does not know the buyer and so on.   It is like any other crime.Gun registration would trace the guns once in effect, tracing would be easy then.</comment>

<comment>First of all, let's deal with the grammatical/semantic issue.  "Diatribe" doesn't mean what you seem to think it means.  Nowhere did I post "a forceful or bitter attack against someone or something."   I asked a question, which you failed to answer in any, substantive, basis.  Secondly, your, feeble, attempt at explaining your argument discloses how little you know about any of the things you are discussing on this topic.  DNA is only meaningful if the suspect has a record on file.  In some states they can collect a sample if one is arrested for a felony (but that begs the question of the basis for the arrest...as in how they prove the gun was ever yours in the absence of a registry.)  Witness testimony is extremely unreliable and is subject to impeachment and suppression. Expended rounds only serve to identify which firearm was used, not who owned it...and are only useful if the barrel to the firearm has not been changed (which is a relatively simple function for any gun owner to perform.)  Credit card transactions?  Must have probable cause to obtain those, and even still there is the question of cash transactions (which would be most illegal sales.)  Pictures and phone records?  Pictures of what, exactly?  Do you honestly believe that people go around taking pictures of gun sales?  Phone records?  That amounts to a "so what" bit of evidence unless you can establish the underlying crime (sale of the gun, which you can't in the absence of some form of registry.)  Ads related to the sale?  That might be enough to establish PC IF you can link the ad to the individual selling THAT particular gun.The question still remains as to how you prove that one ever owned a particular gun if there is no registered ownership per se.  This is the point you are willfully ignoring:  Absent some proof that someone ever owned the gun, that was sold, one cannot establish a foundational element of the crime you are purporting to regulate.  A conservative estimate discloses that 60% of all gun ownership occurs in states that have ABSOLUTELY NO requirement for gun  registration of any kind.</comment>

<comment>No you didn't ask a question as you are not now.  You demand that the link can not proven. You demanded that the sellers can not be prosecuted by saying that nothing be done to prove the seller has sold the gun which is not a valid hypothesis in any real case.  Witnesses for everything including murder should be then called unreliable because you say so.    You are posting nonsense.Now you are attacking the grammar as the hacks often do so you are a hack.Probably you have sold a gun illegally and worried that will come back to hunt you someday.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Go back and READ what I actually wrote.  My question was exactly as I stated it (then and now.)  How do you propose to regulate a transaction when you can't prove it has happened? Sale of something  requires a transfer of ownership.  If you can't prove that "A" owned the gun, previously, then you can't prove he sold it to "B" ("B"'s claims not withstanding.)On edit:Ah the ad hominem attack...the last bastion of the failed argumentoh and btw, correcting your incorrect use of the word "diatribe" was my contribution to your education...you're welcome.  Perhaps next time you'll save me the trouble and learn to use words correctly?</comment>

<comment>No you are wrong.  Ownership of guns that have not been traced are not possible but they are possible if the item is traced, go back and read what I posted and if you have problem understanding it then go suck a lemon</comment>

<comment>You need to stop living in the world of "NCIS".  Your post only serves to demonstrate what you DON'T know in this matter.  You, blithely, assert that the state will, somehow, magically, discover who sold bad people a gun (illegally), but can't articulate any substantive way this will be done.  When challenged on this issue you spout memes about DNA, photographs, charge card records, and phone records...as though this were the answer.  Your last post is so nonsensical, both grammatically and rhetorically, that it simply staggers the imagination.Ultimately it comes down to this:  You are the epitome of the neighbor in Frost's "mending wall."  You have learned a meme and cannot think beyond it.  You do not question it, but hold yourself in high regard for being able to repeat it so well...</comment>

<comment>You repeating yourself.  Time for me to ignore you.Keep posting diatribe claiming nothing can be proven unless you say so.   Ya right..</comment>

<comment>Nope.  I see your reading (and your writing) have not improved.But do carry on...</comment>

<comment>Oh, and btw (as another grammatical aside) the word is 'haunt" not "hunt."  Just consider this another contribution to correcting your, woefully deficient, education.</comment>

<comment>I don't care about spelling.  If it bothers you then don't read my posts.  Nobody forced you to..You are playing the hacking game of grammar and spelling when you get stuck for valid response.Go suck a lemon.</comment>

<comment>Maybe it's because you haven't yet mastered the art of the English language, lolo....</comment>

<comment>Lol, you just got owned...</comment>

<comment>Lol, you're literally full of sh*t...</comment>

<comment>And that "defendant" is not required to testify in court nor talk to anyone other than their lawyer at an time after being charged with a crime.</comment>

<comment>You can't commit a mass murder with illegal drugs</comment>

<comment>Lol.</comment>

<comment>Excellent points.The War on drugs should have taught us that no matter how illegal you make something people can and will get it in vast numbers.Mental/emotional illness is heavily stigmatized, putting the mentally ill in a national database will likely result in fewer people seeking treatment. So I might have the opposite effect.Glad he is wanting to spend more money on mental health however.The measure the President wants would not have prevented the very acts he uses to justify enacting said measures.And hiring more LEO's is seldom a bad idea.But its nothing he could not have done any time in the last 7 years either.</comment>

<comment>By that account, bombs and rocket launcher, machine guns, nukes should be also legal to own because their illegality could cause them to have a black market!!Law abiding gun owners can easily become non-law-abiding gun owners and terrorize people so that rant is a hacked one as well,</comment>

<comment>I don't know about nukes - they are not easy to construct, but the rest of what you describe is indeed available on the black market.The only reason people choose not to have them is it is too difficult to operate.  That said,  I think there is a company (private) in Vegas that lets you shoot machine guns and maybe tanks??? On a range, so I don't think that's illegal.</comment>

<comment>Whether they are easy or not easy to construct is not material argument.  Rocket launchers are not easy to construct either and neither are semi automatic weapons.Your claim that people are not choosing to have them is fraudulent because there is market for all kinds  weapons.You are running on a fraudulent and dishonest argument, period.</comment>

<comment>My argument is, I don't think machine guns are illegal at the very least.  There are companies out there offering you to shoot them.  They are a hassle to get, but not exactly illegal.There is indeed a market for all kinds of weapons, but most people are not interested in them.  Those who are, get them anyway.</comment>

<comment>Machine guns are restricted.  If you don't believe that is a lot of restrictions then that is fine because you would be fine if it is applied to  semi automatic guns with low trigger weight just the same too then""Federal law strictly regulates machine guns (firearms that fire many rounds of ammunition, without manual reloading, with a single pull of the trigger).Among other things, federal law:1. requires all machine guns, except antique firearms, not in the U.S. government's possession to be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF);2. bars private individuals from transferring or acquiring machine guns except those lawfully possessed and registered before May 19, 1986;3. requires anyone transferring or manufacturing machine guns to get prior ATF approval and register the firearms;4. with very limited exceptions, imposes a $200 excise tax whenever a machine gun is transferred;5. bars interstate transport of machine guns without ATF approval; and6. imposes harsh penalties for machine gun violations, including imprisonment of up to 10 years, a fine of up to $250,000, or both for possessing an unregistered machine gun.""https://www.cga.ct.gov/2009/rp...</comment>

<comment>So they are legal, with restrictions.  Yet their overall contribution to murder rate (by both legal and illegal machine guns) is negligible.Therefore, I would conclude that they are not really to be feared at the moment, and if regulations on their ownership were relaxed even more, it would not lead to a spike in murder rate by machine gun.</comment>

<comment>I am asking for the same restrictions for semi automatic guns with low trigger pull weight so agree that it is fine to be regulated in the same manner.Not many people own machines guns because they are restricted</comment>

<comment>Why?  On what basis?  Majority of gun crime is committed with illegally obtained weapons anyway.I don't think gang bangers are queuing up at sheriff's office to clear their firearms purchase.</comment>

<comment>Tanks are actually less regulated than full auto small arms.</comment>

<comment>Yea, I was thinking about that.  I know there was a tank destroyer Hetzer for sale in California about a year ago, and I know private people fly WWII era Mustang fighters and bombers (B-17??), and even Soviet MiG jet fighter, all legally.Is it expensive?  Sure.  But not really illegal.</comment>

<comment>Explosives are perfectly legal. You can get tannerite delivered by mail.</comment>

<comment>No you are lying.  In fact people can not purchase explosives without having authorization.</comment>

<comment>They're a basic part of farming and industry. You can buy stuff like tannerite for stump removal with ease.</comment>

<comment>More lies on your part.  You are just proving yourself to be a fraudster.    Here is the law""since explosives can cause great damage if used accidentally, negligently or criminally, the Federal government maintains strict controls over explosives use. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), U.S. Department of Justice, regulates the explosives industry and issues licenses and permits for lawful uses, ATF.The Department of Transportation regulates the methods of transporting explosives in the United States.  The DOT also decides if a new explosive may be imported or manufactured in the U.S. If the new explosive is too dangerous to be safely transported, it will not be approved for importation, manufacture or sale.""http://www.fedcoplaw.com/html/...</comment>

<comment>Walk into any rural sporting goods or farm supply store.http://m.gandermountain.com/mo...http://www.tannerite.comANFO can be made with common fertilizer and fuel oil. You can't run an industrial society without explosives.</comment>

<comment>First you lied and when faced with documented evidence now you are claiming that fertilizer will deliver a bomb and that is untrue too.  Firstly sale of large amount of fertilizer is monitored and secondly blasting such a bombs requires other chemicals that are banned</comment>

<comment>So tell us, where are these criminal types getting their guns now? Not just those in America, but also Mexico, France, Canada, ... .HINT: It isn't from Jamaica.</comment>

<comment>Depends on the gun.  RPGs come from global black market, small personal arms are from US.  It is best kept this way.</comment>

<comment>It would be even better if those guns weren't on the black market.</comment>

<comment>That would be an impossibility as long as there a percieved need for them that feeds demand.</comment>

<comment>“necessary to save lives and prevent criminals from obtaining weapons.”===================================How about sanctuary cities and Kate Steinle?</comment>

<comment>so more stringent background checks are going to keep firearms out of the hands of criminals? interesting. so about Chicago and D.C. ...</comment>

<comment>...and don't forget the part about where they are not going to bother prosecuting any prohibited person from trying to buy a firearm.It's really an interesting strategy:  complain laws aren't stringent enough, issue more stringent laws/executive orders, don't enforce them at all, scream that they aren't working, complain laws aren't stringent enough...</comment>

<comment>Most of the reforms the president is calling for are supported by vast majorities of Americans, for example - universal background checks, closing the gun show loophole. Obama taking this stance means (caution: pun inbound) that Democrats are actually sticking to their guns.</comment>

<comment>just because most Americans are for it doesn't mean we all get to sit here and pretend it's actually going to do anything. you will not stop the majority of gun violence just by having more stringent background checks. that's a ridiculous fallacy</comment>

<comment>No. But you probably prevent a lot of suicides, and force a lot more criminals to buy their guns illegally, or increase the likelihood they get caught buying them.</comment>

<comment>force a lot more criminals to buy their guns illegallythey already do! this is what you and many others fail to understand. gang members on the south and west sides of Chicago are not going to a gun store and buying firearms, they're doing it on the street already. these measures do nothing. they are an empty gesture from a guy on his way out who doesn't give a shit because if he did, he would have enacted some sweeping measure years ago when the Democratic party controlled Congress but he didn't, and you know why? because he knows gun control doesn't work in America. this is a lazy attempt to help paint the legacy. a piece of paper historians can point to and say "see! he tried to do something!".</comment>

<comment>Criminals get their guns in a variety of ways, but the largest way is a small percentage of legal gun dealers selling them illegally on the side. Closing things like the gun show loophole makes it easier to prosecute these dealers for illegal sales.</comment>

<comment>such an idiotic response, it warrants no rebuttal. keep your head in the sand kid, i guess you think it's safer down there.</comment>

<comment>He could do nothing but cut firewood at his ranch for the next year and shepherding the country out of the great recession, the iran nuke deal, and the recent global warming accords would seal his legacy.  He has to go to all the mass shootings.  I think its starting to get him down.  I don't think this tact is good for the D's, but I don't think its calculated either.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>1) You're far too literate to be Donald Trump. Also, he may sue you for impersonating him. Fair warning.2) Suicide rates vary all over the place, but Alaska is known for having a very high suicide rate, and a high suicide rate by firearm, because firearms are the most effective way to kill yourself.</comment>

<comment>Japan is very much anti-gun in terms of allowing people to have them. They have a very high suicide rate--esp for such a small nation.Its not the guns. Suicidal people will likely not stop because they don't have a gun.Besides, if you want to die why should you not be allowed to do so? And if you to die then why not use a highly effective means of doing so?</comment>

<comment>Japan has a much different attitude toward suicide than the United States, including a long history of honorable suicide. No such history in the US.Most people who try to commit suicide have several failed attempts before they succeed. The easiest way to commit suicide is by gun. Not having a gun might not stop someone, but there's always a chance that they fail, and get help before they try again."Besides, if you want to die why should you not be allowed to do so?"Which argument do you want - the moral argument, the economic argument, the social well-being argument?</comment>

<comment>Maybe, but we need to have a discussion on if a person has a  right to die if they so chose before listing suicide prevention as a positive.I'm sure you can male all three, and I can counter them.We allow abortion under a right to privacy, why not suicide? If you can kill a baby then why not yourself?We allow people to take substances that are deeply harmful--such as alcohol, tobacco, etc. and there is push to legalize drugs. You think drugs and alcohol don't play a roll in suicide?What is the real difference between allowing people to die slowly over a number of years in great pain and just letting them do it quickly and painlessly?</comment>

<comment>I don't believe there's such a thing as a right to die. I'm not a moral fan of abortion either, but it's legal under the current legal framework, and the current legal framework hasn't pushed to de-value life in other areas, so I'm okay with it.I'm deeply uncomfortable with the idea that a government, or anybody but me, gets to make a judgment call about it being okay to take a life when someone else's life isn't on the line. I'm not okay with me deciding I shouldn't be alive anymore either.If I had some painful disease that made normal function impossible, I'd rather be in a coma perpetually with a chance of a cure being found.As for drugs and alcohol, they're certainly enablers of suicide, and direct causes of accidental suicides. The only drug I'd be for legalizing is marijuana. I don't see a lot of suicide related to that.</comment>

<comment>So you do not believe that a person has a right to control their own body?Because that is fundamentally what were talking about.If you can legally take a life by abortion under the "penumbra" of privacy. Then you should be able to take your own.BTW, suicide is illegal and people do it anyway.If you can legally slowly poison yourself to death with alcohol and tobacco, and BTW I'm pretty sure that smoking weed isn't going to be much better as sucking burning plant matter into your lungs isn't likely to be good for you--then why not make it quick?So in the name of preventing a "suicide enabler" we should get rid of alcohol and hard drugs.......pretty sure we already tried that, and the result is why I'm highly skeptical of many gun control measures.</comment>

<comment>Of course people have a right to bodily autonomy, nobody has absolute rights, however. Abortion has little to do with bodily autonomy, it was about government justification for intervention in medical care. I think killing yourself is a hard limit on the right to bodily autonomy.Alcohol isn't bad for you. Alcoholism is. There's a big difference. I never said I was for banning anything. Also, do you mean "gin control," or "gun control" measures? If the former, I'm impressed by the pun.</comment>

<comment>Abortion has everything to do with "bodily autonomy" signs and t-shirts that say, in effect "keep your hands off my body" and "my body my choice?"Guns are not "bad for you" either, them being used improperly/illegally  is. Same argument applies to firearms as alchohol in context.Nope typo. I spell poorly and type worse. Don't care much for gin.If I had thought about it I would certainly have made the pun on purpose. But I missed it.</comment>

<comment>Just because it's on signs and t-shirts, doesn't make it true. Roe v. Wade was about fetal viability and the right to privacy. It doesn't assert any kind of right to bodily autonomy any more than the government couldn't halt a certain medical procedure pending certain conditions.Alcohol vs guns is a bad comparison. Alcohol is a chemical that effects your brain, and effects certain brains more than others. Guns are tools.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it does, first the same right to take a life falls under the "penumbra" of the right to privacy. Surely if you have a right to end a life you can take your own.And the shirts/signs matter because that is how the argument is made. If people invoke the right to the control of ones body to make their case---"my body my choice" etc. then they make it relevant.Yes, guns are tools---but just like alcohol they are safe and effective and endanger nobody when used properly and legally.But here is an interesting question. The idea that people with mental and emotional problems should not be able to buy a gun seems reasonable.But do we apply that same standard to other serious things. Do we for example make women take a mental stability test prior to an abortion? Do we deny the right to an abortion to women with emotional issues---do we keep a data base of women with mental/emotional problems that we check to deny them abortions.Do we cross check the voting record with the mental health records to keep people with mental/emotional problems from voting?Do we apply the same standards to other Constitutional rights?</comment>

<comment>Please explain, in detail, how more background checks would reduce suicide rates in any meaningful numbers.(Bearing in mind background checks don't even ask if someone is suicidal)</comment>

<comment>Mental health professionals could elect (or be required) to submit mental health records to NCIS. Records submitted could include people legally ruled mentally ill, so designated by a qualified mental health professional, designated to likely harm others or themselves by one, or submitted by one on behalf of a patient who the professional to do so.Said people would not be allowed to purchase firearms. Said people would have a harder time committing suicide. This isn't rocket science.</comment>

<comment>Hey, look, by overlooking second and third-order effects and policy implications, anything can be oversimplified to something less than rocket science.Bans for "mental health" are for life is some states, which causes some people to avoid seeking help.Due process should be used when depriving people of rights.Buying a firearm, despite what you may have read on the internet - and doing it legally - is not an instantaneous process.  If someone has to buy a gun, then there are quicker methods (e.g. Toaster in the bathtub, jumping in front of a train, or the worldwide most popular - hanging - which some studies have shown is close to firearms in effectiveness (which, you may be surprised to know isn't 100% guaranteed to work)(And this doesn't even address the fact that many people experience a temporary period of depression due to an event, and are otherwise fine for the rest of their lives)</comment>

<comment>Closing loopholes in background checks is the minimum.   The next thing is to restrict the lethal semi automatic weapons with low trigger weight pulls and large magazine.  Those will reduce accidental shootings.</comment>

<comment>is this satire? please don't tell me you're being serious. do you know what semi-automatic even means?</comment>

<comment>The people who are for such things and support Democrats and President Obama were going to vote Democrat anyway.  The people who are not Democrats, but still agree with the Democrat's stance on background checks, etc are not going to vote Democrat because of all the other positions of the Democrats (for example, an Evangelical who supports "universal background checks" will not vote for the Democrat who supports them because that Democrat is pro-abortion, which is anethma to the Evangelical).</comment>

<comment>The Democrats have traditionally held this problem, but given the character of the Republicans as of late, I think you'll find more middle-of-the-road voters voting for Democrats in increasing numbers.</comment>

<comment>I hope that is true, but 1)I don't think this is the issue that will peel them off, and 2)elections are about mobilizing the base. I am concerned this will hand R's a galvanized 2nd amendment cadre in the next election.</comment>

<comment>1) I agree, gun control/gun rights are still a highly divisive issue.2) There's too much going on at any given time in national affairs to know what the ultimate base-mobilizing issue will be. Remember that in the 2008 elections the War in Iraq and foreign policy were the driving issues until the Great Recession started.</comment>

<comment>Which in other words  means its not a much of a "stance" at all.Deciding to do after 7 years what is "already supported by vast majorities of Americans" is not exactly showing leadership.</comment>

<comment>You're conflating political reality with political ability and will. Most Americans support more investment in mental health services but with our divided Congress, this won't happen for years.</comment>

<comment>But as I understand it the Present is using executive orders to enact his measures. Which requires little more than his say-so.</comment>

<comment>We're both smart enough to know there are obvious limits to executive orders.</comment>

<comment>Which presumably limits them now.Its a Catch 22.If his orders will accomplish nothing little to nothing because of limits. Then they are little more than political theater.If they will solve the problems then it begs the question of why he didn't act 7 years ago, esp during the period when he had veto proof majority during his 1st term.</comment>

<comment>They will accomplish (at least in a legal sense), what they were intended to, unless a court rules otherwise. You have a weird obsession with trying to prove that Obama isn't courageous. I simply couldn't care less.</comment>

<comment>No, I take issue with painting his actions AS something they are not.Its a response TO  a deeply flawed narrative being told, not an stand alone argument on my part.</comment>

<comment>Simply because you can do something doesn't mean its a good thing to do at the time. Executive orders are unpopular with the people generally.However since Obama is leaving office now, he can do more or less whatever he wants. 54% of Americans don't like this executive order from what I read but that really doesn't mean shit to him.</comment>

<comment>So he let people die because it was "unpopular" to take actions that he thinks could save lives?And now that he is leaving office and is has nothing to risk politically he can now take action that will save lives?</comment>

<comment>When did I say these things?</comment>

<comment>Say what things?I quoted your post directly.</comment>

<comment>I never said the words "firm stance." When did I make the argument that the president was showing leadership?</comment>

<comment>I seem to have added the "firm" part.My mistake, changing post to reflect that.But that does not change the either your basic stance nor my response.</comment>

<comment>My stance is basically that the Democrats are finally taking action on positions they've held a long time, which is basically the same as your stance.Sometimes being courageous is smart politics. Sometimes being cowardly is smart politics. Like I said, I really couldn't care less what the narrative is, I care what the results are. If you're expecting politicians to develop a moral backbone, you're bound to be disappointed.</comment>

<comment>So the President decided to let people die because it was smart politics?I'm just tired of article after article after article painting the Presidents actions as something they are not.</comment>

<comment>You don't think politicians of all stripes don't let people die because it's smart politics? You're much less cynical than I am.</comment>

<comment>Then if that is the argument we should neither accept it as voters nor allow it be done without comment and calling out those who do so.We most surely should not be penning articles defending such choices and those who do should be called out their failure to attack such behavior.Yet, that is really not what is happening is it.If that is argument than the problem really isn't guns. It really is people.</comment>

<comment>And 4 in 5 Americans support full body scanners in airports, despite them not working and Europe banning them.  And I'll show you States that still have vast majorities than don't want gays to marry, but that ought not be a reason to deny them to people.Also, can you name the last mass shooting that any of these measures would have prevented?  It wouldn't have stopped San Bernadino or the Oregon college shooter.  Or Virginia Tech.  Or Dylan Roof (who amusingly should have been prohibited, but the system failed).http://www.cbsnews.com/news/po...</comment>

<comment>My most didn't mean to suggest that they were the right thing to do, just that they were popular to do.</comment>

<comment>Guns are not the problem....it's a government who close mental hospitals and a government that slaps the hand of someone who uses a gun in the commission of a crime.....THINK ABOUT IT?</comment>

<comment>I have to chuckle a little.  This is magical political theater.  If a candidate is in a state where Obama's popularity is good, he's also probably in a state where the background checks are popular.  Blue dog dems will be able to sister souljah the background checks and make a show of rejecting Obama, increasing their chances of making it in their territory.</comment>

<comment>Ironic--I have read repeatedly that 90% or more favor background checks.http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-...Still chuckling? </comment>

<comment>Pew says 85% - 79% of Republicans, 88% of Democrats. A wide majority, and bordering on universal popularity.</comment>

<comment>So the President shows bold leadership by waiting 7 years to do what most people already want?Again,. if its really "universal popularity" then its not really leadership is it.</comment>

<comment>You keep making an argument that's besides the point. It's either the right thing to do, or it isn't. The policies either benefit people, or they don't.</comment>

<comment>If its the right thing to do it should  have been done 7 YEARS ago.If the policies benefit people then they should have been enacted 7 YEARS ago.</comment>

<comment>People support background checks at those levels when no details are provided in the poll.The answers change if you ask, for example, "Do you support universal background checks if it means you cannot loan a rifle to a friend?"</comment>

<comment>That's not what universal background checks actually are. A "transfer," refers to a legal transfer, not a loan.</comment>

<comment>So you are ok with a system that allows for indefinite loans? You are creating "loopholes" in your background check system already!</comment>

<comment>Yep. An imperfect system is better than no system.</comment>

<comment>90% favor happy babies and rainbows too.  The question is whether they will switch parties for it.  The reason I want D's out of the gun control business is that there are very, very few people that are so committed to gun control they'd switch parties, donate to a candidate, or advocate for a candidate based on that issue.  Second amendment supporters, OTOH are numerous and vocal.The simple math is, will gun control give democrats more seats, will it cost them seats, or will it be neutral?  I believe it will end up costing them seats and governorships.  If this were a really big issue, that would impact millions, then I would take the hit.  Abortion, for example, is a net loser for D's, but access to abortion directly and indirectly affects millions.  Increased background checks will have a very, very minimal impact.  Nobody says otherwise.  Its not worth the political cost.  We are giving away the chance to impact policy on other issues (health care, tax structures, foreign policy, abortion, etc.) for the chance that we might stop twenty or thirty murders a year.  We could approach these problems in other ways that have less political liability (increased mental health funding, legalizing marijuana so there is less illegal drug traffic to fight over) but we don't for some reason.</comment>

<comment>what if one of those murders is your spouse or child?</comment>

<comment>Then its improbable I will translate that anger into "We need more gun control!"  In fact, there is a high probability I'll become a law'n order republican, and contribute to the problem by feeding more people into the machine that makes them broken, violent and unemployable.  LOL  This reminds me of the Dukakis debate question.Actually, on reflection, the statistics suggest that if its my wife, I was the one who would have shot her.  So I'd be frustrated her life was saved.  If it was my kid, again, statistics suggest that they made some choices that put them in the path of that violence, either choosing violent friends/partners or dropping into a drug subculture that put them in proximity to the violence.</comment>

<comment>Even gun owners favor background checks in general, but when a law is written so one guy handing another guy his gun at a range to try out for a few minutes is considered a transfer under the law, then people start rejecting it.</comment>

<comment>wrong--it pertains to gun SALES</comment>

<comment>True, background checks are widely favored.  The catch is the gun rights people read the actual bill and then get politically active over the entirety of the bill.  Most gun control bills work by PR the bill on things people like and then backdoor things that only some/most gun control people support.</comment>

<comment>Regulations are only meaningful when the risk of evasion, or avoidance, is so high that the majority refuse to accept the risk.  This is not the case in the Presidential Action Items.</comment>

<comment>What Blue dog Democrats?  In 2008 there were 54.  Today there are 14.</comment>

<comment>Hooray gerrymandering and big money. 8/</comment>

<comment>The Democratic Party is not divided on guns? Says who?  If one examines this assertion, closely, one sees that any time Democrats have come out, strongly, against guns (in battleground states) it has proven to be a problem for them.   This dynamic is, currently, playing out in Virginia where AG Mark Herring has chosen to redefine which states qualify for CCW reciprocity.</comment>

<comment>Maybe Obama read Trump's book: The Art of the Deal.</comment>

<comment>Two things are required to reduce mass killings and accidental shootings1- closing the loop holes for background checks2- restricting semi automatic weapons with trigger pull weight less than 12 pounds and magazines larger than 6</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.</comment>

<comment>No you are wrong.   Semi automatic with light trigger pull weight allow for easy to shoot bullets one after another during a mass shooting and accidental shootings by mere touching of the trigger</comment>

<comment>You do realize you can customize triggers...NYPD has their own issues with too high a trigger pull, aka killing citizens and having to mag dump cause you can't aim.</comment>

<comment>Do you realize that customizing triggers can be regulated.  That is the whole idea.  It is bullshit that that it will harm aiming because revolvers have been used for aiming accurately for ages.   In fact low trigger weight can cause accidental shootingsYou must an NRA hack lying for gun industry</comment>

<comment>Really? You can regulate 5lbs vs 4lbs? Lol.It's ridiculous to have an issue with trigger pulls. It literally has no difference. You have issues either way. Ban ARs if you fear semi auto rifles...getting upset about trigger pulls literally makes nobody safer.Light trigger pulls has negatives. Heaven trigger pulls have negatives. Just outright ban guns dude!</comment>

<comment>Guns with low trigger weight and trigger mechanism to lower the weight can restricted... really..All the guns with low trigger weight including semi automatic handguns like glocks are dangerous because they can release many bullets with little effort.</comment>

<comment>"Guns with low trigger weight and trigger mechanism to lower the weight can restricted."Possible, but they won't,because nobody but you supports such silliness and even if you wrote a new law doing so tomorrow, there are likely tens of millions of triggers out there that have already been modified and you can't and won't do a thing about them. P.S., anybody with a little bit of common sense and a india stone can make a trigger lighter. Good luck regulating that."All the guns with low trigger weight including semi automatic handguns like glocks are dangerous because they can release many bullets with little effort."And as pointed out, you don't know that because you yourself have never fired one. Your opinion doesn't count when you have no experience with what you are complaining about.</comment>

<comment>The nobody that you rant about is NRA hacks and nothing new there.The definition that I provided is simple and defines assault weapon of all kinds without much fuss.</comment>

<comment>You have accused probably 100 people in the last year of working for the NRA. The chances of you being accurate on even one of those accusations is less than you being the winner of the latest powerball.The "definition" you provided is your own invention. Nobody but you have ever, EVER mentioned trigger pull as a defining feature. Get over it.</comment>

<comment>You claim this because you have posted under 100s of IDs.</comment>

<comment>Nope, not even close. Please, feel free to prove that i have more than this one ID. I'll wait.</comment>

<comment>Do post more diatribe.  The proof is the canned diatribe that you post</comment>

<comment>It's not diatribe. You are making baseless accusations. and trust me, the last thing my posts are, especially to you, are "canned". You heard that somewhere and use it without knowing what it means. try again.</comment>

<comment>No restrict anything less that 12 lbs.</comment>

<comment>Impossibleto do.</comment>

<comment>Not it is not.  Manufactures are  already able to do it for police force</comment>

<comment>If every gun from here out was made with a 12 lb trigger, people would simply modify them to be less. You also have over 300 million other guns that DON'T have a 12 lb trigger to contend with. You really need to think your posts out more.  Putting a trigger in a firearm that won't allow people to shoot it accurately isn't doing anyone any favors. The results would likely be more like the cops in new york. More innocent people getting shot, more collateral damage. The rate of fire wouldn't be that different and as stated, people would simply modify them.</comment>

<comment>The modification can easily be made illegal.You obviously  have nothing.   Keep posting diatribe</comment>

<comment>WTF?  Changing the trigger pull on some firearms can be done with a simple metal file.  Anyone could do it.  What are you going to do, have "trigger pull testing stations" everywhere?  Will they be offered "no questions asked" for criminals to use ??!</comment>

<comment>That is according an NRA hack.  If you think it can be done they you should shut up now and welcome such a regulation</comment>

<comment>WTF, tstev?  Only one "hack" ...and not a single "goebbels"???This isn't like you, tstev...</comment>

<comment>LOL.  You know that you are proving to be NRA's zillion IDerJust for many faces of youNRA = Goebbels of gun industry</comment>

<comment>There you go...Thanks for hitting the reser Prjijador.We all feel better now, and are worrying that tstev is off his usual off-track.</comment>

<comment>Keep confessing</comment>

<comment>" It is bullshit that that it will harm aiming because revolvers have been used for aiming accurately for ages."Revolvers usually can go into single action mode where the trigger pull is less than half the double action pull. That is why they can be fired accurately. Anyone shooting a 12 lbs trigger on a revolver, double action, will likely not be accurate whatsoever."You must an NRA hack lying for gun industry"That is always the excuse you use when someone disagrees with you. You literally accuse multiple people, daily, because i see it in my news feed, of having more than one ID or working for someone. You are paranoid delusional and can't accept the fact that A, you are flat out wrong, and B, other normal people not affiliated with any company of movement disagree with you,.</comment>

<comment>More of the same, that is NRA diatribe and they agree with themselves quite often with zillion IDs that are constantly flipped</comment>

<comment>You have never provided any proof of that, only repeated paranoid accusation. You have literally accused hundreds if not thousands of people of being someone with a "flipped ID" when that isn't true nor relevant to the conversation. It really wouldn't matter if it were Wayne LaPierre himself on the other end of the screen name. The point is if you are wrong and someone shows that, you are still wrong.You don't like being proven wrong, do you? That's why you always divert to accusing someone of being something they are not, as if that somehow excuses you from being wrong.</comment>

<comment>I have accused you and you have zillion IDs and you are hacking for NRA...</comment>

<comment>Lol, no, i don't. You have never proven ANYONE has more than one ID. You are simply paranoid and use that as an excuse to talk about something else other than the conversation at hand, like you're doing right now.</comment>

<comment>You are the one with zillion IDs otherwise you wouldn't be complaining</comment>

<comment>No, i'm simply pointing out that you're delusional. It's rather amusing to me that you think you can just claim someone is "flipping ID's" to get out an argument you're losing.</comment>

<comment>Keep posting the same  diatribe over and over , you are paid per post</comment>

<comment>You are too clueless to debate it.</comment>

<comment>In what way? You want to make it harder to hit your target...</comment>

<comment>Aim has nothing to do with load on trigger.NRA is Goebbels of gun industry to claim such a thing</comment>

<comment>"Aim has nothing to do with load on trigger."Thank you for proving you have never used a firearm. There is a reason that every single target shooting firearm on the planet has a lighter trigger than it's self defense or hunting cousin. Because it's easier to shoot a gun with a lighter trigger, accurately. This can be sen in glocks line up, where a NY compliant pistol has a 12 lb trigger so cops don't shoot people accidentally, to where a typical self defense gun has a 5.5 lb trigger, to where the target pistols, the G34, has a 3.5 lb trigger. The reason isn't speed, it's because it's easier to shoot accurately. Not that you will listen to reason or fact, as you are all about trying to be "right" at all costs, even when it means you have to lie through your teeth to keep that appearance. The fact is you have no idea what you are talking about because you have admitted in the past that you have never actually fired a gun, so therefore you have no credible opinion on the subject of trigger weight.Fact: heavy trigger weight can induce flinching which drives bullets off target. Nothing you can say will change that. </comment>

<comment>You are product of bullshit factory and logical reasoning does not work for you.The load on the trigger has nothing to do with accuracy and self defense does not require massive serial shootings.Fact:  NRA trolls are in pocket of gun industry and they willing to lie to prevent logical restriction of  the most lethal weapons</comment>

<comment>You don't have a logical thing to say. you are blaming mass shootings on the tools used to perpetrate them instead of the crazy people doing them. You have zero experience with firearms and zero knowledge of them. Everything you post is assumption."a. The firing of an accurate shot depends to a great extent on the quality of the trigger adjustment. An incorrectly adjusted trigger aggravates the errors committed by the shooter as he exerts pressure on the trigger. Incorrect adjustments include: (1) Excessive trigger weight.(2) Excessive long creep (movement of trigger).(3) Too light trigger weight.(4) Variable trigger weight."http://www.bullseyepistol.com/...That is undeniable proof you are absolutely wrong.</comment>

<comment>Now you just flip your ID and posting NRA's links which is hacking for gun industry.The truth""Accidental gunshots by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have more than doubled in two years, endangering bystanders and occasionally injuring deputies. The jump coincides with the department's move to a new handgun that lacks a safety lever and requires less pressure to pull the trigger.""http://www.latimes.com/local/c...</comment>

<comment>And your typical excuse comes out. Nope, i'm still the same joe that has been making you look bad for the last year or so. No need to pretend i'm anyone else to do that.That isn't a NRA link, that is a link to bullseye shooting, which is THE most accurate pistol shooting there is. You are objecting to is, calling it what it isn't, because it proves you wrong. That is using the genetic fallacy. Feel free to prove what that link says wrong.Sorry, your link is irrelevant. It explains it right there, less pressure required. when you are used to carrying a firearm that has a EXCESSIVELY HEAVY TRIGGER, anything else feels light. It doesn't mean it is.Sorry, your post is irrelevant. My facts stand. Blaming triggers for mass shooting is like blaming gas pedals for speeding.QED</comment>

<comment>Again, for nth time.  I have posted evidence that the "police" have had more accidental shooting with low trigger weights and and so that is the proof that you lied.   So the link you have in produced by NRA hacks.  In fact any gun toting hack can produce a site and that is what NRA hacking is involved in.  Zillion of trolls and hacked literature.</comment>

<comment>The police having accidental shootings isnt' proof of anything except the police having accidental shootings. I've explained it's because they weren't used to the lighter pulls of the semi autos. The fact is that currently almost every single cop in the country uses a semi auto and i don't see a national issue with cops having accidental shootings still. There is no proof i lied, because i didn't. Everything i have typed is factual, you just don't like it because that proves you wrong.No, the link i supplied has nothing to do with the NRA no matter how bad you want that to be true. It's not propaganda, nor is it a lie, as it's instructional how to for the discipline of bullseye shooting. If you think different, than prove any of it incorrect. Note, your bs link to a LA times article isn't acceptable.You sir, are a bullheaded liar. Pretending there is a conspiracy of disinformation going on so that you can claim what you post, with no supporting data, to be proof.Credible proof or don't bother getting back to me... My facts still stand.</comment>

<comment>No your rants are not evidence.   That is evidence.</comment>

<comment>I supplied evidence. you attempted to claim it was wrong by employing the "genetic" logical fallacy, but you have yet to disprove a word of it. You have no evidence.If one group of people have guns with extremely heavy triggers, (triggers so heavy that the public doesn't willfully purchase guns with them), then that same group is given triggers half that weight, then of course it takes a while to adjust muscle memory. You seem to be ignoring that little fact. It doesn't mean the triggers that weigh 6 lbs are unsafe or overly light, it means that people used to 12 lb triggers tend to fire guns with 6 lb triggers without meaning too.  Since you have never fired a gun with either weight trigger, or any gun for that matter, your opinion is irrelevant.Try thinking for yourself once in a while.</comment>

<comment>I don't accept sites that have been hacked by gun nuts to be evidence or  supply evidence</comment>

<comment>Dude, who else is going to write explanatory articles on firearms and competitive shooting that people who are knowledgeable about firearms?It's not "hacked" nor does that word mean what you think it does here. I personally don't care if you believe the link or not, because it is accurate and factual regardless of what you think. you have nothing to refute it, so it stands. It is outright illogical to assume that someone would go through the trouble to try to invent all the information contained there simply so they could make a lighter trigger appear to affect accuracy the way it does. Anybody who really wants to know about and understand the dynamics involved in accurately shooting a handgun will quickly recognize my link as 100% factual.Refusal to accept facts doesn't make those facts incorrect.  I proved you wrong, you just refuse to accept it.</comment>

<comment>Now you are double posting.Get lost you hack</comment>

<comment>Double posting?Another lie, imagine that...</comment>

<comment>Lol, you fraudster hack! You triple posting now! You flip your id's to rant like illogical bafoon!</comment>

<comment>The genetic fallacy (also known as the fallacy of origins or fallacy of virtue[1]) is a fallacy of irrelevance where a conclusion is suggested based solely on someone's or something's history, origin, or source rather than its current meaning or context.Sorry, unacceptable. Either prove the information wrong, or the information stands:)</comment>

<comment>I don't even press on your links from land of fraud and gun nuts  because you are a hack.   You have proven to me that you don't have a straight bone in your body.  You are full blown fraudster in every category that there is.  You have a zillion IDs. You are a stalker and you have been stalking me over and over and flipping IDs.  You post fraudulent rants over and over.   You are constantly posting NRA's rants and NRA links.</comment>

<comment>So you ignore facts in favor of pretending you're right.Good to see you finally admit that.You have never, ever proven me wrong.You have never proven me to have more than one ID, because that is your excuse to not answer questions and to get out of arguments you are losing, like this one now.  I don't stalk you, i prove you wrong repeatedly and you can't accept that. You are paranoid delusional if you think that everyone who posts to you is the same person. I showed no less than 5 examples of you accusing people of that yesterday... Not one thing that i post is sourced from the NRA.You're a liar in denial.</comment>

<comment>So how does trigger pull stop gun violence?</comment>

<comment>It reduces the RPM of guns and serial shootings, that is how. Also it reduces accidental shootings with small amount of force.Lower RPM, less bullets per minute, less dead people in mass shootings</comment>

<comment>Have you ever shot a gun? You sound ridiculous. My finger pulls a trigger just as fast...You are just making operating a weapon safely and engaging your target, more difficult.</comment>

<comment>No, he hasn't. He admitted that years ago and has a thing against firearms because a friend of his was shot to death. He doesn't listen to reason whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>Keep posting diatribe .   You are ranting about me at flipping  your zillion IDs</comment>

<comment>Sure it does. Excessive trigger weight will cause a person to pull the firearm off target while trying to get the gun to go off. If you had ever fired a gun you'd know that, but you haven't. It also induces flinching which is anticipating the recoil before it happens. Now you have no reason to lie anymore.</comment>

<comment>No if So by that account most  revolvers and most no semi automatic used for 100 years    are useless.    Obviously you are just ranting.   In fact it is the apposite, accidental shooting is more likely with a light trigger.Stop post to me you fraudster and Goebbels for gun industry</comment>

<comment>Once again you showcase your ignorance...Most revolvers, old ones, are single action, which doesn't have a long heavy double action trigger pull. Before semi auto, all you had was revolvers. Duh.The revolvers cops carried DID have a long, heavy trigger pull, which is one reason they went to semi autos, as well as added capacity.Stop lying and i won't have a need to post truth that makes you look stupid.</comment>

<comment>Keep posting diatribe.   Nope you are lying to claim revolvers are old because you are a fraudster.   There are tons of brand new revolvers in the market and they are not old or single action.Joe = Goebbels of gun industry</comment>

<comment>Revolvers ARE old. "The first guns with multichambered cylinders that revolved to feed one barrel were made in the late 16th century in Europe. They were expensive and rare curiosities. Not until the 19th century would revolvers become common weapons of industrial production. One of the first was a flintlock revolver patented byElisha Collier in 1814."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Hey look! Brand new single action revolvers!http://www.ruger.com/products/...Tstev = anti gun zealot/fact denier.  That's cute how you pretend that i have a different ID so you can ignore the facts i'm posting. Sorry, you have to actually prove them wrong. If you can't, they stand.</comment>

<comment>No revolvers are not oldThis is just one company'shttp://www.smith-wesson.com/we...</comment>

<comment>I didn't say all revolvers were old.That's obvious because i just linked you to brand new single action revolvers. I said old revolvers are single action, which is true. You jsut choose to not believe me because you want to be right. I own 3 smith and wesson revolvers, so you could say i'm pretty familiar with them...</comment>

<comment>Nope  you did lie.These are all double actionww.smith-wesson.com/webapp/wcs...</comment>

<comment>So what? I never said Smith & Wesson made single action revolvers. I did not lie, dummkopf.Gets your facts straight before accusing me of lying...  It's not my fault you are wrong. It's yours. you literally refuse to learn and refuse to accept that not every piece of information regarding firearms that is presented to you is false. As a matter of fact, you haven't ever proven a single link provided to you as false, you just use the "hacked NRA" excuse to pretend it's false. You are in essence, lying to yourself. It's pathetic that you are so ingrained in the need to be right that you ignore everything that might prove you wrong.</comment>

<comment>You did lie, period.Stop stalking me. Go float your lies to someone else.</comment>

<comment>Where did i lie and why have you not proven it?</comment>
