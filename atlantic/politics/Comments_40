<comment>More reason to use Uber I guess.So it goes.</comment>

<comment>the self driving cars that this magazine likes to write articles about are all going to feature WAY more than point-in-time license plate captures.</comment>

<comment>An excellent point. Time to become a hermit I guess. Thank goodness Amazon can drone deliver stuff right to your doorstep. Now, just gotta remote access the worksite and never leave the basement, wallpapered with tinfoil and other materials.</comment>

<comment>They'll never find you that way.</comment>

<comment>The amount of info Amazon has on you is scary too.</comment>

<comment>A better solution would be to defund the surveillance agencies and rewrite the laws to stringently prohibit this panopticon tracking . Civil liberties review boards might be a good idea, too.</comment>

<comment>Robert Stephenson is a loser.</comment>

<comment>How so ?</comment>

<comment>I was annoyed when people were complaining about the NSA collecting metadata but weren't bothered by the fact that companies were storing all this information in the first place. Especially since random corporations are much less responsible and trustworthy than the government. At least the NSA wasn't trying to auction off what they found.</comment>

<comment>That's free market capitalism for ya.</comment>

<comment>Stalin, now he was a great guy!</comment>

<comment>And most definetely the only person who ever criticized unregulated capitalism.</comment>

<comment>Oh, maybe you prefer Xi Jinping.</comment>

<comment>[facepalm]</comment>

<comment>Wait, are you being sarcastic?  </comment>

<comment>I hear a lot of people complaining about that, too. But not on corporate-owned media outlets, of course.At this point, (a few specific, not 'random') "corporations" and "the government" are essentially the same.</comment>

<comment>How about Google keeping track of all your searches? Or your email - somewhere on the server that belongs to the company you probably don't even know?</comment>

<comment>It's time to push back hard on ALL that stuff.</comment>

<comment>I hear you, but I am curious how this stuff can be prevented even in theory. We had law enforcement writing down the license plates of the suspicious cars since the days license plates were invented - this is the same idea, in automated fashion.</comment>

<comment>Fashionable plate-covers for when you are parked, for starters.</comment>

<comment>Illegal.</comment>

<comment>So what?Turnabout is fair play, and when the Law has no respect for the people, the people will dutifully return the favor.(And if the cover said "Tag Applied For" it looks like a recent used-car purchase and so would be more legal-looking)At some point, compliance becomes complicity.</comment>

<comment>The Germans were right to obey the Nazi party. Because they would have been shot had they not.</comment>

<comment>That's cowardice, and is what allowed things to get so out of hand back then.</comment>

<comment>It has happened many, many more times than that. The outcome is always the same.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's ultimately defeated by the majority, at least once they find their collective spine and DO something about it. “At what point, then, should one resist? When one's belt is taken away? When one is ordered to face into a corner? When one crosses the threshold of one's home? An arrest consists of a series of incidental irrelevancies, of a multitude of things that do not matter, and there seems no point in arguing about one of them individually...and yet all these incidental irrelevancies taken together implacably constitute the arrest.” ―Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</comment>

<comment>The 3rd Reich could have lasted forever. Oppressive systems do not fall from within, they can only be pushed over from without.</comment>

<comment>Like the USSR?</comment>

<comment>An anomaly. They threw in the towel rather than get really oppressive. And we were kinda pushing on them at the time...The further back you go the more you see peasant rebellions being successful. Because the military/information/messaging advantage the state had over the citizens was smaller.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that what went on in the ussr can be qualified as really oppressive. I think my coworkers who came here from Ukraine back in the 90s would disagree with the assertion that the soviets weren't really oppressive.Agreed on your point about information and communication being an advantage for the state. Though it seems we're on the brink of turning that cart over, with all these encrypted messaging services etc being decentralized and private entities.Coupled with the general distrust of the state by the people, it seems that's the direction in which we're headed.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps 'really oppressive' was softballing it. I meant genocidal.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, but I don't think they would consider the collective farms and mass starvation under soviet rule as anything less than genocide.</comment>

<comment>At the time of the USSRs collapse it wasn't nearly that bad. You're  conflating seriously different time periods - Stalin vs Gorbachev.</comment>

<comment>I understood what you were saying. The system is the problem, the people are interchangeable cogs -regardless of the form of government.For example, I would bet that one of the things keeping the hardliners in check was the reality of economics.There's probably not much that can compare to living under Stalin, it's a shame he lived as long as he did.</comment>

<comment>Put a few infrared LEDs around your plate and it will be unreadable by cameras.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't actually work very well.You need to use a bunch of unlensed IR LEDs from an old DVD burner (e.g. relatively high-powered but still unobtrusive) or LLEs (laser light engines) to effectively wash it out (I've been experimenting...)</comment>

<comment>what about those "whole car" covers that you use to protect your nice ride from the nasty weather? Deploy, deploy?</comment>

<comment>Still doesn't matter. They also get moving-cars.</comment>

<comment>Aside from the point that this is illegal - your plate number would be taken down every time you pass an intersection with the camera - read: pretty much any busy intersection. If enough statistics is gathered, one won't care about where you park - they can deduce it based on your movements.</comment>

<comment>Every little bit counts.Increase the friction.</comment>

<comment>Laws can be rewritten (the government does this all the time to legalise whatever it does - even retroactively) , civil liberties review boards instituted , surveillance agencies and police departments defunded , cameras taken down . It's not impossible .</comment>

<comment>Ride a bicycle. Seriously, ride a bike.It makes you exponentially harder to track. Take public transit. If you don't have access, push for access. Work to find solutions that allow you to use your bike together with transit to solve "last mile" problems, then press your local government to implement them. If you drive a car you pay 30 times as much as a bicycle will cost you to make yourself physically and mentally weaker, sicker, and an easier target for surveillance.</comment>

<comment>Public transit doesn't help in many places, as they can track your farecard. This is less so in some places that use individual ride tickets, but if you have a metrocard or an oyster card or something similar, it's relatively easy to compute where you've been.</comment>

<comment>Re: the Oyster card (you mean London, right?), it's still possible to buy one without registering it. The authorities could then prove that card # (fill in the blanks) had made trips X, Y, and Z, but unless they supplemented this with other kinds of evidence, they couldn't prove that the same *person* had used that card for trips X, Y, and Z.Of course, facial recognition software is getting more and more sophisticated, so the Oyster card will be a moot point soon enough.</comment>

<comment>It's true that would have a hard time pricing in a court of law that you were the only one using the oyster card absent other evidence, but for investigational and data gathering purposes, it's close enough, especially if you use a credit card to buy it, or they can correlate it with cell data. If you think about the license plate trackers, they know where the car is, buy not who is driving it, which again provides information, but isn't dispositive in a court, especially if the household had more than one driver.</comment>

<comment>Have a cell phone? Have WiFi on? You are telling every router you pass "I am here" as well as everywhere else you have EVER connected to WiFi... So biking or public transit will only do so much. Vigilant has cameras everywhere apparently. Maybe they also put routers nearby?http://arstechnica.com/informa...</comment>

<comment>That still doesn't explain the exact harm to me personally from someone knowing that yes, I am indeed out and about in a public space. The router discovers "I am here". Frankly, so what? The department store camera also discovers "I am here" when I walk in. That's my face on the image.Is the ideal here really for nobody to ever have any idea you do, in fact, exist? Because that's what it sounds like.</comment>

<comment>Because humans aren't perfect and everyone makes mistakes. But we aren't well equipped biologically for forgiveness.It's a harsh, cruel, uncaring world where an arrest when you are 6 years old ruins your life. And exactly that has happened many times in America.85-90% of teenage boys admit to an offense that would land them in jail. When every one of them is punished for his *CRIME* then the world becomes a worse place.</comment>

<comment>Yeah... several years ago a bunch of my friends and I were discussing that African-American kid in Georgia who ended up in prison for having oral sex with a 15-year old girl when he was 17, and they both attended the same high school.Most of our discussion hinged on "so what's the statute of limitations on this kind of thing... it's been 20 years since I was 17, so I'm in the clear, right?"</comment>

<comment>Can't say for your state, but in Texas it's when the 'victim' turns 28.</comment>

<comment>Of course you are right. No harm could possibly come from entities collecting vast amounts of personal data on their (potential) enemies. Oh, I see, you have no enemies. I get it.</comment>

<comment>And the data bases are ever so secure . I mean , they're never hacked or stolen . No one with illegal software ever uses them for voyeuristic or malicious purposes . Never , ever , no , not ever .</comment>

<comment>Because it is possible that your perfectly harmless daily activities will suddenly be deemed "suspicious" by law enforcement for reasons beyond your control. And if they can track you, you will pay a price for their decision.For instance, let's say you went to a local shopping center, had a couple too many at the bar, and spent the night at the motel next door. That same night, a person was murdered by the dumpsters behind the shops and the cops are under major pressure to identify a suspect. Your car was the only one in the lot at the time of the crime and they have a shot of your plate to prove it. Such false positives happen and will only become more frequent with the spread of this sort of surveillance. Thanks Vigilant(e) Systems!Or perhaps your everyday activity that you have engaged in for years suddenly becomes politically unpopular. A peaceful American Muslim could go to the mosque daily with no problem in 1998. But after 9/11, he could find himself profiled and investigated by a task force of the NYPD (no matter where he lived) based only on the fact that his car parked at the mosque regularly.There is no telling what law enforcement fads or short-term needs could turn you into a "person of interest" needlessly. But if they can't track you without a warrant, it really curtails this sort of fishing expedition. If we know enough about anybody, it will be easy to create a scenario where they look suspicious. Especially if we are under pressure to "get the perp" for some awful crime. We have a warrant system so that we can track people who really are suspicious. We should not treat US residents as if they were criminals just for living here or parking a car in a public place.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, that motel/ dumpster example doesn't need contemporary surveillance methods to become a reality: totally incorrect eye-witness accounts have made your scenario a low-tech reality for as long as we've had our legal system.</comment>

<comment>Well said !</comment>

<comment>You posit a false dichotomy . There's an ocean of difference between nobody having any idea ever that you exist and 24-7 surveillance of your every move . How would you like a jealous or vengeful ex-spouse or ex-lover or malicious neighbour with ties to law enforcement to target your every move with the aim of finding something - ANYTHING - on you ? Would you like your medical records to be public knowledge ? Or just simply personally embarrassing photos of you yawning gapingly, sneezing , looking stupid - then posting them online or on bulletin boards where you work ?And you never know what can be retroactively criminalised or become a socially unforgivable gaffe in the future .</comment>

<comment>If you really don't want to be tracked, you can always turn your cell phone, or its wi-fi features, off. In any case, an effort to track passing cell phones would make it quite clear that the companies involved are selling surveillance of people pure and simple. Companies that sell license plate tracking can claim they only sell the tracking of assets to enable companies to enforce vehicle liens, for example. Riding a bicycle makes it harder for companies and governments to track you and also makes it harder to justify that surveillance.</comment>

<comment>>you can always turn your cell phone, or its wi-fi features, offNo, you have to take the battery out. Because the GPS chip can't be turned off in any way.</comment>

<comment>and more and more of these phones have a sealed case such that the battery really can not be removed.  Need examples?</comment>

<comment>With some of the newer models , you need a Faraday cage to keep off the surveillance . Removing the batteries is not enough .</comment>

<comment>This sort of data is often resold and packaged for various markets. By the time the insurance company or mortgage company, etc. get the data they probably don't know how the identification was made - license plate, cell phone tower, WiFi, face recognition, etc. They just know you wake up at a certain time, go to bed at a certain time, live here, work there and spend your free time at these locations.</comment>

<comment>Did just that for years, but then I moved to a city that treats bikes like most U.S. cities do (as children's toys, exercise equipment, or the last resort for people who got too many DUIs).That is to say, no appreciable accommodation for anything human powered (few sidewalks or bike lanes, no awareness among most residents about sharing the road, etc.). I was hit by a car on two occasions in the city that DID accommodate bikes well, and stopped since I really don't want to be a martyr for alternative transportation.I'll  be moving back to where I can ride instead of drive just as soon as I can.</comment>

<comment>... until they add the cameras that watch over the bike lanes. All in the name of security, right?</comment>

<comment>There's still a difference between a state-issued license plate with standard fonts and a human face (to the extent the cameras can catch it), as well as a difference between a commercial incentive (or excuse) to track cars versus a purely political choice to track bikes.Look, many cyclists (full disclosure: including me) consent to have some of our rides tracked for planning purposes. I have an app that I can turn on or off for that purpose. But for those people who don't consent to have anyone track them, a bike or a bike plus transit gives the best option. Anyone can legally pay cash for transit if they want privacy; they can also legally obscure their face while riding.</comment>

<comment>In theory. In practice - are you sure it is, in fact, deleted? Did you try to really clean, say, IE? It's not as straightforward as hitting a button "delete all history".</comment>

<comment>That's what Disconnect is for:D</comment>

<comment>... which is great to clean stuff up on your end. Won't do much good against, say google searches - that stuff gets saved on Google end. And yes, they have already figured out how to identify the user based on the digital blueprint only.</comment>

Or use Tor browser.</comment>

<comment>Tor, while good, isn't a bullet-proof solution either. http://motherboard.vice.com/bl... , for instance.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and as I've said I don't do the squicky or drug stuff, so I'm not particularly worried about the NSA. I'm more concerned with civil liability.</comment>

<comment>Embassies and consulates the world over (and not just ours) have explosive devices attached to their computers in order to detonate them should the building be taken over by hostiles . The hard drive has to be physically destroyed to make it unsearchable and the information on it irrecoverable .</comment>

<comment>Not that simple either. They can do a lot with a modern-day electronic microscope.They typically use rapid-acting acids and the like to really destroy the data.</comment>

<comment>Google sells that to third parties who don't delete it.</comment>

<comment>No, Google does not do that.They take all of your information--search history, emails, whatever--and put it into a big black machine-learning box containing their secret sauce. This machine then chooses ads for you to see and possibly click on. If you click on a higher proportion of the ads, the advertisers make more money, and Google dips their beak in the middle. Hence the importance of the secret sauce.Google does plenty of creepy/spooky things (their whole schtick is balancing creepy and useful), but using your search history to customize ad views is one of the most straightforward parts of their business, pretty much unchanged for the last decade and a half. Here's a good explanation and discussion.</comment>

<comment>It is possible to buy access to google data and credit card data using that along with other data such as metadata to individuate people as individuals.http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/..."In fact, knowing just four random pieces of information was enough to reidentify 90 percent of the shoppers as unique individuals and to uncover their records, researchers calculated. And that uniqueness of behavior — or “unicity,” as the researchers termed it — combined with publicly available information, like Instagram or Twitter posts, could make it possible to reidentify people’s records by name."For cell phone data:"In other words, to extract the complete location information for a single person from an “anonymized” data set of more than a million people, all you would need to do is place him or her within a couple of hundred yards of a cellphone transmitter, sometime over the course of an hour, four times in one year. "http://news.mit.edu/2013/how-h...</comment>

<comment>Neither of those articles mentions Google specifically. I can see them funding research on de-anonymization here, and I'm faintly aware that you can get anonymized or aggregated datasets from them (generally researchers request it--do they actually sell it?), but can you point me to somewhere that you can buy access to "google data" which is vulnerable to de-anonymization?</comment>

<comment>If you're worried about Google keeping your search history, you can delete your existing history and prevent them from saving any more. If you'd like to add an extra layer of privacy, you can use Incognito mode as well. (Generally available on mobile as well!)</comment>

<comment>Use Disconnect Search, or a different search engine, and they can't keep track of your searches. We can't do something simple like that to stop Vigilant.</comment>

<comment>"random corporations are much less responsible and trustworthy than the government"  I disagree</comment>

<comment>Yeah? Do you get to vote on who becomes CEO of AT&T?</comment>

<comment>Do we get to vote on who becomes president really ? What with the duopoly and Citizens United and paperless electronic voting machines where exit polls differ significantly from voting results everywhere they're used and all that ?</comment>

<comment>I think a key difference is that Vigilant Soln doesn't have the legal ability and right to imprison or kill.  I'm not a fan of what they're doing, but the private sector doing it is a little less worse.</comment>

<comment>Citation please.  For a contrary data point:Ferguson, Missouri, an overwhelmingly black and Democratic city:Washington Post: Ferguson shows how a police force can turn into a plundering ‘collection agency’</comment>

<comment>Same difference.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, no.  That would be an important life lesson to understand.</comment>

<comment>Welcome to Earth. You'll catch on eventually.</comment>

<comment>If no data was collected or sold, government would not have it.Read the "privacy" statement for this site and tell me if that is a promise of privacy. You have no clue as to what happens to the metadata collected by this site.</comment>

<comment>You mean you don't surf through TOR and a VPN?!?</comment>

<comment>I am not, nor are most people. By the way did you know that the law gives greater freedom to collect data to government when that data is directed to Tor and uses a VPN? I guess not.Do you wear a mask and a hood when you walk around? Why not?Connect the dots as to why that wouldn't be such a good idea.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but this isn't the context for a primer on basic 'Net privacy and how to circumvent most eavesdropping.And go study Chaos Theory.</comment>

<comment>I am familiar with "chaos theory" so called. I don't think you get the idea that it is not possible for most people to achieve "net privacy" given the way the economy works together with the induced addition to social media, streaming entertainment, game playing and so forth.All of these provide a real time psychobiography which is much more intimate than data that governments have so far tried to generate on their own.Oligarchy has no interest in removing the possibility of using the net and all communications to gather and monetize information. The fiction that it is otherwise reflects the success of that effort.</comment>

<comment>Privacy is easily attainable once one has decided to no longer buy what they are selling.Granted, that makes it inconceivable to most but once the cost (in terms of money and sheer annoyance) exceeds the perceived benefits of anything, people tend to walk away.It literally doesn't matter who is on the other end of the wire (or what they're doing) if you go ahead and cut it. Why just ask the Iraqi insurgency...</comment>

<comment>People are not able to decide to walk away because they depend on the economy for everything, and that now includes mediated association with other humans. People text each other while sitting next to each other. There are not enough cabins in the woods for six billion people and not enough roots and berries or rabbits to snare.The fiction of return to individual self sufficiency is a fiction another version of pie in the sky.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say it would be easy, or that very many would be able to even imagine such an option, but that dependency you speak of is a function of one's desire for certain things that we can live without.We'll have to learn how anyway since our current path is completely unsustainable (as we'll all see soon enough).</comment>

<comment>I agree that the current world economy is unsustainable. I disagree with your assumption that individuals are in a position to change their desires and in so doing transform the world economy. I think you have cause and effect backwards which is what capitalists claim when they say that "the market" is giving people what people want.Capitalism creates the wants that suit its goal of maximum profit and denies the wants (needs) that are incompatible with it. That is the reason that oligarchy opposes environmental constraint on its enterprises</comment>

<comment>Time will tell.</comment>

<comment>And it's not "so called."It's an actual, robust Theory in accordance with the technical, scientific definition of the term. So it's just as robust as gravity, and the math suggests that one day we'll probably beat gravity, but we'll never be able to crack Chaos and predict the behavior of highly-complex systems beyond their relatively near-term future.</comment>

<comment>The part that it is a so called theory applies to the contention that it explains anything.  It is a description of macro events as if they were fundamental particles. That makes it a metaphor, not a scientific theory. Transposing a theory to a new field of application and then pretending that it has imported its support to that new field is junk science.</comment>

<comment>You mean like the weather?A highly-complex system is just that, regardless of the context. And the higher the complexity, the higher the unpredictability with regards to the effects of even minor perturbations of said system (e.g. the "butterfly effect").</comment>

<comment>Weather models used in forecasting and climate models, are not examples of "chaos theory" at all. Facts matter.</comment>

<comment>Meteorologists were integral in the formulation of it.Yeah, facts matter.</comment>

<comment>That is not a reply at all. Weather models are not pure formalisms since that have explicit empirical content that isn't a formalism.Every aspect of such a model that make it about weather is added to the formalism to make it useful in application to the actual world.</comment>

<comment>I wasn't talking about modeling.You could look into the history of it yourself, you know.</comment>

<comment>Dude, you're on another Chaos theory kick. You don't know chaos theory, don't pretend you do.</comment>

<comment>I've studied it for a while now (years).</comment>

<comment>Who is delivering free potable water to the Flint citizens who were knowingly sold poisoned water by their government?</comment>

<comment>As bad a Flint is (and it's pretty bad) it's not as bad as this: http://knowledgenuts.com/2015/...Intentionally poisoning people during the Prohibition Era was something else.But I guess you get the government you deserve, or something like that.</comment>

<comment>They (corporations who elect state legislators) first demand and get the budget cuts at the state level that make Flint bankrupt, then the state takes over Flint and refuses to add treatment to the cheaper supply of water it decides to use, which poisons people.Then they hand out water to prove that government doesn't work.</comment>

<comment>Please support these three and a half contentions you put forward -1.  "They (corporations who elect state legislators) first demand and get the budget cuts"     Who, what and when here please.2. "the budget cuts at the state level that make Flint bankrupt"    Attributions here please.3. "the state takes over Flint and refuses to add treatment to the cheaper supply of water it    decides to use"     Please provide documentation for state assumption of Flint's water supply and the state's   refusal to treat the water.TIA</comment>

<comment>They're still being billed for water they can neither drink nor use to the tune of $400+ per bill . If they don't pay , a lien is put on their home . If they have children , CPS will remove them , because it is a crime not to have running water , even if it is poisoned water unfit for living beings . Those who want to throw in the towel and move away are not allowed to put their homes up for sale until or unless they spend $10,000 - $12,000 to replace the water pipes corroded by the chemicals flowing through them for the previous two years . A win-win-win for crony capitalism .</comment>

<comment>Taxation without Representation. The people who made the decision to poison the citizens by selling them contaminated water ought to be imprisoned and given nothing to drink but that water. Poor people. Poor children.</comment>

<comment>Governments have a monopoly on legitimate force, which corporations don't. Corporations are basically limited to negative actions, while the government can take positive actions. While for most people, the practical day to day effects may be more dire from private actors, like if you get denied a loan or a job based on your web browsing visits, they can't throw you in jail or shoot you, which the government can.</comment>

<comment>It's a different picture , however , when the corporations own the government .</comment>

<comment>A government that is too weak to take away from you anything will be too weak to serve you</comment>

<comment>You know, if we have a choice between big government and big private capital, I would prefer the government. At least, their tracking would suck.</comment>

<comment>Hey stupid, Big Government loves Big Business.  It is called crony capitalism.  Big government makes things easy for the Goldman Sachs and GEs out there.  Why do you think they are run by Democrats, and giving Hillary money?</comment>

<comment>Hey idiot, do you prefer the government or the private capital to keep the records on you?</comment>

<comment>Private capital.  They can't arrest you. Duh!   Wow, you are really stupid.  Did Ford or GE ever have concentration camps or gulags? </comment>

<comment>No, they aren't going to arrest you. They will just sell all your data to the highest bidder. Did it ever occur to you that they don't collect the data just because they like watching people?</comment>

<comment>I.G. Farben just supplied the Zyklon-B . Corporations and even small factories made thrifty use of the slave labourers provided by the government . They used them up by working them to death in unspeakable conditions , then got resupplied with human protoplasm units from the concentration camps .</comment>

<comment>In Nazi (big government) Germany, corporations did what they were told.  Look up Gauleiter .  They were the ones who controlled civil affairs in Nazi Germany.

If you think big corporations are what caused all the problems in post WW1 Germany, you are a complete idiot.</comment>

<comment>CF, will you tell us what becomes of the metadata collected from this site? Or do you still believe, as you once wrote, that it would be a violation of your professional obligations to do so?Collecting metadata from this site by 20 or so third party agents who resell that data to anyone is also a  means of tracking people. The difference between this practice and the license plate readers is that CF is paid from fees collected from selling the metadata.There is no privacy for anyone connected to the internet or anyone who uses a credit card or debit card at checkout. Cell phone apps allow tracking in real time of individuals using data collected invisibly and continuously which is then sold.CF has been campaigning against government collection of data for years and has been indifferent to the facts about the end of privacy as a result of the monetization of the data collected by Google, Facebook, and so on because his libertarian ideology is based on the fiction that government is the prime enemy of privacy.  This is a deliberate misdirection.</comment>

<comment>" This is a deliberate misdirection."Indeed.Just to be clear, you were referring to your own comment, correct?</comment>

<comment>It is clear that the data collected by private corporations and resold is the origin of the problem. So pretending that the "privacy" protections offered by this site or google or disqus (which is google) actually provides privacy is a misdirection. Is that clear enough?</comment>

<comment>Way to completely miss the point.Did you know that there are people who leave their houses and go do stuff who don't even have computers?I'll just leave it at that and see if you can connect the dots all by yourself.</comment>

<comment>It should be noted that, contrary to the author's assertions, the Supreme Court has never adopted "mosaic" theory and under current precedents, this is probably legal. "Mosaic" theory is a favorite of Orrin Kerr and Eugene Volokh, and some federal circuits have adopted this libertarian theory, but at present it is primarily something winning praise from legal scholars and devotees of the Federalist Society.</comment>

<comment>I had never heard of this (as a non lawyer), so for others in the same boat:http://repository.law.umich.ed...As I understand it, the question is at what point in a series of steps does a collection of information by government become a search subject to the 4th amendment. (A legal zeno's paradox)The parallel for privacy would be at what point in the aggregation of "anonymous" bits of data is the promise of anonymity broken. It is evident that in this version, the answer is that it is broken when an individual can be identified with a high degree of confidence from the aggregate.</comment>

<comment>It is appalling that a private organization can collect and profit from this information without the consent of the people involved.   Our law is profoundly lagging technology at this point, with scarcely any meaningful leadership or commentary on the consequences.    All of these bulk surveillance technologies (public cameras, phone tracking, browsing profile creation, etc.) need to be required by law to have simple opt-out provisions to prevent collection of data where people don't wish it to be collected, and provisions that give the individual control over how their information is released and used, absent a warrant issued upon probably cause by law enforcement.And if providing that means some business model doesn't work, so be it.</comment>

<comment>Very soon we will all long for the quaint old fashioned technology of license plate readers..... said every software engineer working on facial recognition algorithms.</comment>

<comment>I think that we have to admit to ourselves that the old notions of privacy have been swept away by technology, and turn our attention to regulating how information about citizens is handled. We must acquiesce to the fact that privacy as we know it is simply impossible. As I write this, there's an ad on the page offering to sell me variations on a product that I was looking at at Amazon.com yesterday. People know almost everything I do on the web; I can't stop it. However, we CAN write laws restricting the access that the government has to various kinds of information. At this point, I think that's our best hope.</comment>

<comment>Why must we acquiesce ? We weren't consulted about any of this . I don't recall a popular vote or a referendum ever . Right now , your most personal information is for everybody to slice and dice , except for you . For every measure , there is a countermeasure . With the law on the side of protecting our privacy and the appropriate countermeasures , we don't have to relinquish privacy .</comment>

<comment>I am NOT a fan of this or any other tracking or data gathering.  That said, I think we are past the point of return.  Big Data will antiquate technologies like LPR's within 10 years.  Everything we buy and everywhere we go will be recorded in real time by service providers and the government.  The only way to avoid it is to go off the grid and move to someplace like Alaska where it's still possible to get lost.</comment>

<comment>If you don't need a warrant or a subpoena for the data, then there should be a website where anyone can search for a plate number. I don't expect it to be free, but it can't be priced so a normal person wouldn't use it. Looking at Vigilant Solutions website they only offer a subscription service (and don't provide pricing.) If it was the law that any "privacy data" available without warrant or subpoena had to be offered to the public at large for a reasonable fee, then the public would be well informed about exactly what this data could do. Instead of theoretical situations, there would be an informed debate. Data society deems to be private could be protected by law (requiring a warrant) and the rest would be treated no differently than it is today.</comment>

<comment>You can do web searches on license plates right now. I did one a couple of months ago on a habitually dangerous driver, one who has endangered my life multiple times, and once I knew what her name is, where she lives, where she works, car make, model and year, I called the cops to report her. Of course without actually observing the bad behavior themselves, they won't do anything.Cost? $20</comment>

<comment>Not if that's all it was. But if she had a kid and you called CPS that's the end of her relationship with her child.</comment>

<comment>And rightfully so. The stuff she's doing is threatening the safety of everyone within range of her car as well as the people in it.</comment>

<comment>No, not rightfully so. The kid will be raped 2-30 times in foster care and probably drop out of school. Not a better situation.</comment>

<comment>So you really think I should consider what might happen to her kid at some unknown - and unlikely - point in the future, when she is actively endangering my life, along with hers and everybody else's anywhere near her?First of all, she didn't have her kid in the car with her. Second, it is not my concern what happens to her or her offspring if she is endangering my life.What if I had my kids in the car with me? Would some far-fetched, unlikely scenario about this foster care hallucination of yours trump my need to protect my kids? If so, I would like to know what planet you live on.</comment>

<comment>Did she hurt anyone or did she just drive in a manner not pleasing to you?You are blowing this out of proportion, I'm sure.</comment>

<comment>You weren't there, so you know nothing about it. Piss off.</comment>

<comment>So I'm right and you siced the worse police state in the world on someone for displeasing you and hurting no one.I'm sure you call it in when you 'smell something' too.</comment>

<comment>Well meaning citizens should follow the Cops and report on their whereabouts 24/7.</comment>

<comment>Comparing this to 1984 is a little bit of a stretch. If I recall correctly, the cameras in 1984 were also in private locations, such as households.To begin, I hate this. I absolutely hate this. But if a citizen is free to film in any public area, where do we draw the line? Is the filming by the company illegal? It would seem no. Is selling the information illegal? Probably not. I think the onus is on law enforcement to use the information responsibly (which we all know would require laws and oversight). Technically, it is similar to interviewing a witness. Now maybe the company should be held liable for not vetting who they give the information to. If a stalker with a restraining order pays them for information that then allows him to go and kill or assault someone he couldn't otherwise find, should the company be liable?The distinction seems to be between "seeing" and stalking". And there really isn't a legal distinction. Though of course, just because something is legal, it does not mean it is right.</comment>

<comment>In your stalker scenario, yes. Yes they should be held accountable for selling that information.</comment>

<comment>When Orwell wrote 1984 he had no idea how much information could be gleaned simply from the back of an envelope (metadata) or location tracking (this).Really, they don't need to look at what you are doing inside the house to know what you are doing.

If you attend a female's house at 5pm when your wife is not at your home they know you are cheating on her.He simply didn't know what was possible with metadata.</comment>

<comment>Another point to this article, and the one about using a company to determine a person's threat level before responding to 911 calls is that police should be required to make public the tools they are using to police the public. And the public should have some say into how they are used, as well as knowledge of the processes used by these private companies.</comment>

<comment>Recently, a collections agency has been harassing my mother because I allegedly hit a car and owe the driver's insurance company money. According to the agency, they are working on behalf of a specific, well-known insurance company to collect this payment ($200 or thereabouts).But when asked, they can't provide any contact information for the specific insurance agent in charge of the case. They provided me with a police report number (which I never checked out), then later told my mother that there was no police report. They did not know that I am the owner and sole driver of the car in question (my mom co-signed). They did not know that my mother and I live halfway across the country from each other. All they had was my license plate number and my location.Now I'm wondering if a company like this supplied my information to this shady collections agency in return for a percentage of their profits. It's a good scam, and I'm sure they have extorted vast amounts of money with their scare tactics. It was very stressful and frightening, and if I hadn't had a friend who'd been through this to talk me down, I might have paid them the relatively small amount of money to make it go away.Does anyone have any tips for people who are victimized by agencies like this?Edit: Everyone who is saying that no one has a right to privacy on the road should also consider the fact that operations like this allow for massive and widespread scams like the one I've described. Sure, any company can hire people to go out and write down random license plates and manually add them to a database, but if you can have software scanning continuously and assembling such a huge pool of people, it allows companies like this shady agency to scam huge numbers of people simultaneously, at a fraction of the cost.</comment>

<comment>The American government has proven itself time and again by standing against the average citizen. It does not care about the vast majority of its citizens - only those at the top who can lobby their way out of trouble. As Americans, we eat toxins for food, and drink toxins for beverages. Our infrastructure crumbles, and we haven't a clue why. Better yet, we KNOW how to solve these solutions. Our refusal as Americans to own up to our end of the civil/government contract we put in place over two hundred years ago, is responsible for what's happening right now. And we, the average citizen, are to blame. Until we make our government respect us as citizens, they will continue to walk all over us. Plain and simple. We need to stop worshiping sports, and celebrities, and start paying close attention to our laws and our corporations.</comment>

<comment>people who try to fix those things get jfk'd or mlk'd.  the best we can do today is the black lives matter movement blocking highways.  that's no way to 1776</comment>

<comment>Most of this is true , except for the victim-blaming ,"And we, the average citizen, are to blame ." No the the corporate greedheads who profit from these devices and the omnivorous security/surveillance agencies are to blame for it . We were never consulted about any of this , and as Edward Snowden revealed , most of it has been concealed from us and lied about .</comment>

<comment>Good point, but it all started when we decided to send our politicians to govern, and then stepped out of the voting booth. Most people I know, only vote in Presidential elections - if that. I for one, choose to be as informed as possible on who I am voting for, and will vote, sign petitions and join movements that I am aware will benefit our country. I don't care about the lines of principles. I don't care about socialism versus capitalism, or middle east/Europe versus America. I only care about what works for this country and what doesn't. And that requires research and time and energy. What makes it harder, is when people WE all send to Washington, decide that corporations should control our media and values. Since when should any government allow such a travesty, is beyond me. They say money talks, bullshit walks, and I for one believe that  the vote is mightier than the dollar. And an informed citizen is more powerful than a lawmaker.</comment>

<comment>The telescreens in Orwell's 1984 were in everyone's homes; these cameras are in public spaces. Public space is, umm, public.If you think this company should not be able to take photos in public spaces, should you also be restricted from taking photos in public spaces? Or, perhaps, you would be permitted to take photos, but only if you don't show them to anyone (let alone distribute them on the Internet)?Why would anyone have an expectation of privacy in public spaces?</comment>

<comment>When Orwell wrote 1984 he had no idea how much information could be gleaned simply from the back of an envelope (metadata) or location tracking (this).Really, they don't need to look at what you are doing inside the house to know what you are doing.

<comment>What most people forget about George Orwell is he wrote fiction</comment>

<comment>It was pretty accurate in predicting the police state. Not so much the exact mechanisms, but the totality of monitoring to harshly punish all people who stray. And it accurately predicted the culture of paranoia that it would create.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't a prediction, actually. Orwell was describing the same authoritarian impulses potentially corrupting states since the dawn of man, only with a technological and cultural innovation we had not imagined yet. Monitoring for punishment is certainly a problem for modern citizens and their right to privacy, but that problem is mostly exacerbated not by photographing license plates, which to date has harmed literally no one as best as I can tell, but by the voluntary submission of damaging information through social media, which has harmed thousands.</comment>

<comment>It's harmed drug dealers, they just don't tell the public where they got the evidence. The cops make something up about a random stop for speeding.The problem is that, as a species, we are equipped to live in a small town where you know the bad things about a person but you also know them as a person and so are more forgiving - and where you can pick up and start over if you screw up.When you apply such instincts to a place where "the internet never forgets" you get this thing where people dox someone back to middle school, find some racist tweet, and ruin a career - and that person never recovers, because the ruckus is on the internet a search away forever.Or where someone tweets something that's off-color and generates a huge political backlash that gets them fired.Humans are simply not equipped to self-police 100% of the time. Nor are we equipped to forgive people we don't know personally.Human nature *is* to find the wickedst thing a person has ever done and hold it against them forever. The worst thing you ever did is the first thing everyone will know about you, forever.</comment>

<comment>"It's harmed drug dealers"Correction: it has harmed criminals.If the evidence is already a matter of public knowledge, as your public visage is, and always WILL BE, then it is admissible.</comment>

<comment>>criminalsSon, we have a million laws. 85-90% of teenage boys have committed a crime that would land them in prison. Will land them in prison, once we get around to it.</comment>

<comment>I'll take your word for it. But I don't make my decisions on the law based on some vague overarching theory about the malevolence of everything. I judge on a case by case basis, depending on both the individual's personal actions as well as the merits of the law they are accused of violating.</comment>

<comment>And you know photographing license plates has harmed no one HOW ?</comment>

<comment>He wrote prophecy !</comment>

<comment>I'm not really understanding the nature of the threat here. Theoretically, any citizen could be tracking your license plate for years. When you go out in a public space, you are in the public eye. Nobody has a right to be invisible in public. Sure, Johnny NoGood could easily phone up Vigilant Solutions and find out that was indeed my car parked at Target on Tuesday, Smarch 32nd, but what can he personally do to hurt me with this knowledge? Maybe if I were a politician or a celebrity caught doing something perfectly legal, but embarrassing, that would be a problem. But that is a personal problem, not a rights problem.</comment>

<comment>Citizen! I say to you, if you have nothing to hide then you have nothing to fear!</comment>

<comment>Everyone has something to hide. What is at issue here is under what exact circumstances you have a right to hide it. Yes, your medical information is nobody's business. No, your visibility in public is not a threat to your rights.</comment>

<comment>Certainly, if you are a good citizen then you have nothing to fear! Only those who make mistakes should fear the government!</comment>

<comment>It is responses like these which make me think the privacy rights movement is composed mostly of a bunch of conspiratorial loons who want to pretend their really fighting the power</comment>

<comment>There is no fighting the power! State is all powerful! Submit or die! Work or starve!</comment>

<comment>You're playing the role well, I'll give you that. Absolutist black and white either-you're-with-us-or-you're-with-the-terrorists has created more problems than it has solved. Unfortunately, you fail to recognize you are the opposite side of the same coin.</comment>

<comment>What makes you think I'm joking? We very much live in a 'submit or die' country. If you submit sooner than later you'll be hurt less. But you rarely, if ever, have the option of not doing what a cop wants and getting away with it.</comment>

<comment>I don't believe I implied you were joking. I take you completely at your word.Having lived in foreign countries that were under actual very real threat of the government literally kicking in your door at night and disappearing you without so much as a warrant, I can tell you the United States of America is a long way off from the dystopia you portray it as. In fact, I find the casual nature with which Americans will proffer offhanded references to dictatorship patently offensive, since most Americans wouldn't know the first thing about dictatorship, seeing as how you've never lived in one.</comment>

<comment>An early post by (I presume) a legal expert pointed to the concept of a "mosaic" search that evades the fourth amendment by searching in tiny increments no one of which counts a violation of privacy.More generally, the concept may be applied to the promise of individual anonymity for the meta data which is lost by means of data dredging aggregated records.http://repository.law.umich.ed...</comment>

<comment>I think the First Amendment applies in that prior censorship (stopping the data collection) is unconstitutional  After the data is sold if it results in harm or injury, there maybe be a basis for a civil lawsuit, or a criminal complaint in how the data was used.The free speech case Brandenburg seems to apply to gathering of the data, but so does the commercial free speech case Hoffman Estates v. The Flipside on regulating the sale of the data.</comment>

<comment>I'd really like to see what sort of case would be granted standing to portray harm in the instance of license plate photographing. I've read many breathless columns from privacy advocates for years about how this is the beginning of the Apocalypse, but I still cannot come up with even one good reason why anyone should consider their license plate private information when A. the individual is out in publicB. the license plate itself is already a matter of public record</comment>

<comment>Like the Paparazzi, we may hate them, but at the end of the day we grudgingly admit they mostly have the right.</comment>

<comment>Your phone is a better indicator of where you have been than your car... and it checks in automatically.</comment>

<comment>And every single American has one, including children</comment>

<comment>Are there any license plate protectors that can block the cameras?</comment>

<comment>Anything that could do it would be illegal.</comment>

<comment>I would think that a device that obstructs vision of the plate to a field of view that is directly behind or in front of the vehicle at 10' or less might be legal.</comment>

<comment>I'm a big advocate for privacy from the prying eyes from government.This story doesn't rankle me much. Maybe it should, but it doesn't.</comment>

<comment>Did you miss the part about how various government offices are *buying* this information? Is your point that it's okay if the government has this info, as long as it buys it instead of being the one to gather it initially?</comment>

<comment>I agree that the potential for this information to be misused is big. Maybe I should be worried about it. I'm still thinking.</comment>

<comment>The next Edward Snowden will show us how much it's ALREADY being abused .</comment>

<comment>Vigilant Solutions--like a private vigilante group for hire.  Capitalism at its best.  This should be the title for Quentin Tarantino's next movie.  Or maybe a collaboration with the Wachowskis. The Death of Irony.</comment>

<comment>Must be why all the plates in the ghetto are stolen</comment>

<comment>"Ted Cruz’s presidential campaign is using psychological data based on research spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission, to boost his surging White House run and gain an edge over Donald Trump and other Republican rivals, the Guardian can reveal."http://www.theguardian.com/us-...</comment>

<comment>I appreciate this article, but when something carries the headline "the unprecedented [plot] to [insert bad outcome]" it's hard for me to take the contents seriously.</comment>

<comment>I live on and drive on dirt roads mostly and leave my phone off most of the time.  Track that.</comment>

<comment>My license plate indicates that I go from home to daycare to work to daycare and home again Monday through Friday.  SO exciting, I hope they get their money's worth.</comment>

<comment>I will bear that in mind.</comment>

<comment>That truly is scary stuff.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the article, Conor."The NYPD has a long history of spying on Muslim Americans."Too many Americans will think that justifies it."More laws might be passed to stymie this trend if more Americans knew that private corporations and police agencies conspire to keep records of their whereabouts."Too many Americans will say, "If you have nothng to hide, why worry?"I bet someone in these comments will say those things, or already did.Orwell was right, and only off by a few years.</comment>

<comment>I thanks the NYPD (and Lady Luck) for keeping NYC in good hand by spying on you-know-what</comment>

<comment>So what is the problem?</comment>

<comment>The problem is that this is even considered an acceptable (by some people) practice.  There are all sorts of ways this information can be misused.  And there is no way that information once captured and stored is safe from those who would misuse it.</comment>

<comment>The Portland Police Bureau patrol cars have license plate cameras built into them so as they drive around town, they are logging all of the license plates visible to their cameras.  It's terrible.</comment>

<comment>if that Portland Police Dept has that system connected to Amber Alert, then many kidnappers or carjackers will learn a hard lesson if they drive into Portland</comment>

<comment>Amber Alert was my favorite 1970s porn star.</comment>

<comment>license plates are rather hard to remove</comment>

<comment>Sie haben nichts zu befürchten, wenn Sie nichts Unrechtes getan haben.well known saying in Germany 70 years ago'you have nothing to fear if you have done nothing wrong '</comment>

<comment>A license plate is a public display.</comment>

<comment>So in Street View videos the parked vehicles in driveways have to have their license plates blanked out?</comment>

<comment>So what?</comment>

<comment>I know I'm in the minority here but its hard to get upset, even as disconcerting as these individual examples always are.I kinda just accepted that privacy as we all used to conceive of it no longer exists. Gotta fight it on the "what can be used against you" side, not the "what are they going to get" side. Probably could use some  SCOTUS caselaw that delineates some of this so states can legislate it.That's not to say I don't think there are other problems involved, because there certainly are. Just that, where technological paradigm shifts are involved, you're better off adapting than trying to stop it outright.  </comment>

<comment>>what can be used against youAnything and everything.I'm reminded of a divorce lawyer's advice - if you want to keep money away from your wife don't keep it on your computer, in your house, and don't bookmark the website, and turn internet history off. Because if it's on your computer a simple search will turn it up. Same with web history. Same with your house. That can't be used in court though, so what's the big deal?Simple. If they know about something, anything, they can devise a way to legally acquire the knowledge (that they already have) that can be used in court.This has happened many times - 'random' traffic stops when the real info came from reading everyone's email, or phone call metadata. They tested a rape kit against a commercial database, found a match, then asked the guy's nephew if they could test him - sure enough, it was a low-% match to the guy they wanted, and now they had a legal way to get a warrant.And you can't win by getting laws removed either. Even if our government was functional they aren't going to legalize moving 20 pounds of pot, or statutory rape.</comment>

<comment>The government is literally storing your emails and phone calls. You are worried about pictures of license plates?"Unprecedented"? Give me a break...</comment>

<comment>Once people got last names it was game over.</comment>

<comment>False .</comment>

<comment>It sucks when you can't even have privacy in public places.</comment>

<comment>This is not an invasion of privacy.  Your license plate literally exists in order to be seen publicly.Spying on emails and telephone calls?  An invasion of privacy.Taking images of license plates, tagging then with a location and putting it in a data base?  No an invasion of privacy.  You don't have a right to move about in public without being seen.  Nor does your car.</comment>

<comment>Maybe *THAT* is the problem. Why do we have to identify ourselves to drive on a road?</comment>

<comment>Because you can kill someone with your car on a road and drive away </comment>

<comment>Because the roads themselves are public, and you have the potential to do a lot of damage, so being able to identify which vehicle was in use in any particular time and place is valuable.</comment>

<comment>hello [insert license plate number here] you don't know me but i'll let people know where you've been and when for a small fee.  i look forward to using you for business</comment>

<comment>Hello, dimwits.I am just checking in to remind you that Killary Clottin' voted for the PATRIOT Act twice.Thanks, Granny.</comment>

<comment>Who cares.  Being anonymous was a thing of the past.  A decade ago you jump-at-your-own shadow folks were all having heart attacks over the idea of using your real name online, and now you all use facebook.  This fear too shall pass.</comment>

<comment>And we are now being ruled by the shadow government . Every one of the things the jumpers warned about has come true in spades .</comment>
