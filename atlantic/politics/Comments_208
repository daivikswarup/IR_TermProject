<comment>Any fight involving the religious right is bound to get nasty.  That is because they are a bunch of hate-filled hypocrites who choose to ignore the central tenet of Christ's teachings:  LOVE.</comment>

<comment>They are just scared. Love should conquer fear. But we have to let it. It's not automatic. They can come around to non discrimination, even the ones who don't agree with homosexuality being religiously acceptable. To be fair, most people in most times and places were of this opinion, and the world's traditional cultures aren't going to change soon. So we're just going to have to learn to coexist.</comment>

<comment>Fear + they believe themselves special and chosen, thus part of a larger groupthink that peddles divinity to replace loneliness and an inability to self-direct. The catch is unbending faith in variant myths and superstitions created to provide no exit door. Throughout human history that has always been a dangerous if not combustible illusion. Their inward failings match their outward mistake: fervently believing everyone else is as lost and lonely, fearful and unintelligent as them, requiring an overarching superstitious intervention. Worse still, their controls do not seem to work. The most violent people and places are the most religious. What sort of witless human being needs a 2,000 religion to tell them it is wrong to kill another person or steal?</comment>

<comment>These States are bucking the Federal Civil Rights act of 1964. Specifically, it is illegal to discriminate on the basis of religion. Denying someone a service because their religion does not agree with the proprietor's religion is discrimination. The States can not over ride that protection. Even where same sex does not have explicit State protection, the reading of Obergefell suggests they do. It might be a hard sell to suggest people can marry but may not buy a wedding cake.Times have changed. 50 years ago it was illegal to be homosexual. Less than 15 years the government could even toss you in jail if they didn't approve of how you fornicated. In the past 15 years the roles have entirely changed and a large majority think there is nothing wrong with two same sex adults hooking up.</comment>

<comment>Presumably, a bakery's choice not to sell to a gay couple would not prohibit that couple from buying a cake elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>Nor does the bakery have to be open to the public.  Also a choice.  DO they also serve adulterers, etc?</comment>

<comment>Maybe -- but it's harder to tell if someone's an adulterer. If an adulterer came in and asked the baker to bake a cake celebrating the ten year anniversary of her and her paramour's first hook-up, no doubt they'd refuse as well.</comment>

<comment>Good point.  .Also, why should common run of the mill laws that favor homosexuals discriminate against religious people who are protected by the supreme law of the law, i.e. the Constitution.  If homosexuals want special protections then get an Amendment passed..But this is nothing compared to the crazy muslims the angry liberals are importing into this country.  If you think the right is bad just wait until your new pet of the month come and throw you off a building.  The so-called religious right want to be left alone and will prey from you, the muslims want you to change your ways or die.</comment>

<comment>And how exactly are any laws discriminating against religious people? Denying someone the ability to discriminate is NOT discrimination. In other words, telling someone that runs a business that they can't fire someone or refuse to serve someone because of who they are does NOT in any way limit the religious freedom of the owners of that business. Homosexuals don't want "special protections." They want the same protections against discrimination afforded everyone else by the Constitution. You are proposing that they are not entitled to constitutional protections.</comment>

<comment>How is it discriminating?  Locking someone up and ruining their business  because they don't want to violate their religious beliefs is not discrimination to you crazy liberals?  ..What if I went to a gay shop and demanded that they bake me a cake and participate in an event that bashes homosexuals where everyone sing anti-homosexuals songs about std's and homosexuals?  Should they be forced to participate in that?  Should a Jew make a cake that said Jesus wants Jews to convert, or a muslim bakery to participate in an event where everyone pretends to be their cult leader bending over taking it from behind?.Like I said, if homosexuals want special protections than get an Amendment.  Otherwise, stop your hate and leave everyone else alone with your deviant lifestyle.</comment>

<comment>BWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! False is equivalency is FALSE. The only "deviant lifestyle" is you and your bigotry. DEAL with it BIGOT.</comment>

<comment>yea having sex in a park with someone you don't know, then the next night going to a glory hole, then the next night having sex with 5 people at a party then invading a family parade to dance around half naked.  Having the highest rate of STD's by far.  Yea that's not deviant you wacko..The only bigot is you because you want to impose your lifestyle on others.  People like me say live your life but don't make me a part of it.  .So go F-off you bigot sicko.  And remember safe sex and get tested because stds are bad and because you get them so often the most common are now becoming drug resistant.</comment>

<comment>You seem to know a lot about the "gay lifestyle" for a white priviledged christian interesting.</comment>

<comment>You really are not too bright, are you? In one case they are discriminating against people. In the other, the baker is being asked to promote hate speech. Having a job or a place to live is not a "special right", except in your distorted world view. </comment>

<comment>wow, so many words yet zero rational thoughts.  You know just because you say something doesn't make it true.  I know you want to force your beliefs on to others (something about liberals, you're all fascist), but like I've said all along (documented in this thread) homosexuals don't have special rights over other people, especially when the other people have the 1st amendment on their said..Either make a valid point or sit down and shut up because you sound like an intolerant bigot.</comment>

<comment>You win the dumbest, least rational,  person on the Internet award hands down. Congratulations!</comment>

<comment>And you win the fascist award, Hitler would be so proud of you. trampling on peoples rights to impose you own Godless will without any authority under the law..You liberal intolerant  scum make me sick.  But don't worry, you're not an extremist, after all almost 2 people agree with each of your post, hahahahahahahahha.</comment>

<comment>White hetero christain enjoying white privilege. Did you not learn anything from the 50's? Like that battle to keep blacks in their place, you will never win this one as hard as you might try.</comment>

<comment>Very well stated and 100% correct. </comment>

<comment>stop that nonsense</comment>

<comment>Don't you pay any attention in class?   Is called the 14th amendment. </comment>

<comment>Since you are clueless (don't feel bad, most liberals are), I'll be your teacher today.  So pay attention and LEARN something for a change..So you jump right past the 1st Amendment (THE FIRST) and travel to the 14th?.In my class I learned how the 14th (and 15th and 16th I believe) were passed to allow free blacks equality before the law.  I highly doubt that people right after the civil war were like: "you know, we need homosexual marriage, lets pass some Amendments."  .If what you said was even remotely true, then  why did we have to pass the 19th Amendment?  We needed to pass that because the Superme Court case of Minor v. Happersett, 88 U.S. 162 (1875), held that the Constitution did not grant women the right to vote. The Supreme Court upheld state court decisions in Missouri, which had refused to register a woman as a lawful voter because that state's laws allowed only men to vote..Women had to wait all the way until 1920 (40+ years after the 14th) when they got their own Amendment, yet you think homosexuals are more special than women?  Are you retarded or just a know-nothing idiot?.PS, as a bonus history lesson for you, The 19th was initial brought up by the Republicans and was shot down by your liberals (kind of how republicans had to end liberal slavery)..You're welcome for the lesson now run along little girl and let the grownups debate.</comment>

<comment>I am amazed. Maybe you did pay a bit of attention in some of your classes. However, in your zeal to label me a bigot you failed to notice that the democrats that were responsible for slavery and later for segregation slowly decomposed into republicans over the span of a couple of decades after the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.Judging from that temper of yours, I d be willing to say that you do not qualify as a "grownup".</comment>

<comment>right, the tired line that somehow through magic, the parties switched sides.  That's a fairy tail your liberal master lie to you, because they are so ashamed of the FACT that they (through a big power government) used the state to discriminate against classes of people they didn't like..Republicans believe in a limited government (always had and most still do) whereas liberals and democrats believe in the power of the government to force beliefs onto others.  .Stop with the nonsense.  Your argument is as false as Hillary's claim of being pro-women as she attacks rape victims and enabled one of the worse sexual predators.</comment>

<comment>Oh, republicans believe in limited government huh. You mean like Ben Carson does? When he said that he thought that the department of education needs to act as thought police on college campuses?""I actually have something I would use the Department of Education to do. It would be to monitor our institutions of higher education for extreme political bias and deny federal funding if it exists."So much for HIS notions of limited government.I can remember when the south was almost entirely democrat. I can also recall listening to my father, several Texas judges, a couple of Rangers, and a herd of ranchers all talking about leaving the democratic party and defecting to the other side due to a bill Johnson the Traitor signed into law.The south left the democratic party due to their support for desegregation. </comment>

<comment>wow, so an anecdotal story leads you to make full range assumptions on millions of people.  Ok, well I heard Sal Alansky and Bill Ayers say they wanted to blow up the American government (and actually did), therefore, all liberals are terrorist (using your logic).  Yea, great way of thinking...NOT.  .Give it up lady, first you lost your first argument and now you're losing this one.  You're not smart enough to debate me when all you can use is emptions and fear.  Facts, evidence and reason win out each and every time.</comment>

<comment> I heard Sal Alansky and Bill Ayers say they wanted to blow up the American government (and actually did),Really? Sal Alinsky? Bill Ayers? And they blew up the American government? I would ask you to explain that, however, I realize you never would. You might post some other inane claim, but only in your warped mind can that make sense. But, feel free to explain how Alinsky and Ayers blew up the government.You're not smart enough to debate me Ad hominems always put your arguments over the top. Especially when your arguments bear bear no semblance to reality and are mostly fabricated.The South left the Democratic Party because of desegregation. It won't matter how much you deny it. It happened.</comment>

<comment>You have no actually presented any debate, just accusations and vitriol. You remind me of those relatives of mine whose secular power and actions were tainted by their inability to separate religion from politics.Conservative republicans only want small government for themselves; And, total control of ever aspect of everyone else's lives for the sake of power.</comment>

<comment>You're nothing but a sore loser and cry baby.  Go cry to someone that cares about what you have to say, oh wait, NO ONE cares what you have to say because in your 5,551 comments only 3,833 people agree with your extreme logic..Did that hurt your feelings?  Don't worry, I'm sure one of your many cats will make you feel better.  Now, good bye, you're not worth my time, I've explained the law to you, reason to you and common sense to you but to no avail.  Your mush brain doesn't have the ability to comprehend anything more than bumper sticker slogans from Vermont socialist, Chicago race hustlers and wicked witch sexual predator enablers.</comment>

<comment>I've been reading your other 'posts' and the replies you have garnered. Mostly, you have thrown up smoke screens, straw men and spewed vitriol when the straw men and smoke fail you. And, you spew a lot.Mostly what I have seen is you failing to intimidate others with your rapier less wit. What makes you think you can intimidate or anger me?</comment>

<comment>You have me confused with someone else as my name is not Barrack Hussein Obama.</comment>

<comment>And your deflector screens are down.</comment>

<comment>Not a good point at all. Are you suggesting a constitutional amendment to give gay people the "special protection" of having a job, a place to live, or the ability to buy a cake? Do you realize how ridiculous that suggestion is?</comment>

<comment>Wow, nice straw man argument.  Let me ask you something, why do you have to lie about my position and make a straw man argument instead of debating what I actual wrote..Don't bother answering because I already know your answer:  You're too stupid to make a counter argument against what I actually said and you know I'm right because I have the law on my side.</comment>

<comment>See the 14th Amendment. No state shall deprive any person of the equal protections of the laws.The Uganda "kill the gays" bill, and continued criminalization of gay people there, is supported and promoted by "Christians", including American evangelical Scott Lively. Some Christians support killing all gay people. Hate and genocide are not exclusive to any one religion.  Religion remains an excuse for genocide, for some.</comment>

<comment>wow, you liberals are so stupid and all have the same groupthink, I guess I'll repeat myself: .Since you are clueless (don't feel bad, most liberals are), I'll be your teacher today.  So pay attention and LEARN something for a change..So you jump right past the 1st Amendment (THE FIRST) and travel to the 14th?.In my class I learned how the 14th (and 15th and 16th I believe) were passed to allow free blacks equality before the law.

<comment>Spoken like a true white hetero christrian enjoying a life of white privilege who will never get it.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I don't listen to bigots.  Welcome to the 21st century you knuckle-dragger.  Intolerance of people different from you is not cool anymore.</comment>

<comment>It's easy to tell if someone is an adulterer, just see if they are divorced.  Jesus himself said (quoting the common usage at the time) that marrying a divorced woman was adultery.</comment>

<comment>Yep. But a small business owner doesn't have the wherewithall to do deep background searches on people, so that's not very practical.</comment>

<comment>How about that small business owner doing business with every member of the public under the same terms and conditions? Simple solution, huh? </comment>

<comment>Small towns still exist. Many customers become known to the vendor. Many small towns only have one option for some services.</comment>

<comment>Except that they would have NO clue whether most people are adulterers. That is the point. They serve plenty of people who certainly have beliefs and live a life that is inconsistent with that baker's religious beliefs. The baker doesn't ask everyone who comes in to fill out a questionnaire to see if they are "pure" enough to be graced with goods from that baker. The ONLY reason they discriminate against the gay couple is because they can immediately tell that they are gay. It is a double standard and should NOT be legal. Their religious beliefs are NOT being infringed in any way by baking them a cake any more than they are if they were to bake a cake for a Jewish, Muslim, or atheist wedding.</comment>

<comment>Well, I suppose they'd be equally quick to refuse to bake a cake for a Satanist group, or a Nazi group or NAMBLA, or any other overtly sinful group.</comment>

<comment>sin is only in your mind-its religious brainwashing that educated people overcome by research into ones' religion-we suggest you try it</comment>

<comment>They sell advertised products, not event approval, nor approval of the private lives of the customer. Selling a product does not make you a participant in the lives of the customers.</comment>

<comment>Not a double standard. Most Christians as well as Orthodox Jews probably don't care how "pure" the people are who buy goods from them. How you do go on with exaggerations. They do; however, object to participating in something they disagree with.Therefore, they would not refuse to serve adulterers; but they would balk being asked to bake a cake lauding adultery. Perhaps a nondescript cake could be sold in either case.</comment>

<comment>And they would be equally wrong in doing so. </comment>

<comment>The event is irrelevant, as is the customer. The vendor sells an advertised product, not event approval, nor individual approval. How the product is used is literally none of his business.</comment>

<comment>Highly unlikely they would refuse. Hetero adultery is a few pegs up from legally married same sex couple if that makes any sense to you because it makes no sense to me.</comment>

<comment>If their religious views forbid them from serving adulterers, for some strange reason, it would be within their rights to refuse to do so. You and I are not obligated to patronize such a business.</comment>

<comment>No, they would not be within their rights to refuse goods or services to a member of the public, where non discrimination laws exist, if they are in business to serve the public, they don't get to pick and choose. Why is that so difficult to understand? </comment>

<comment>You may not have any choice, especially if discrimination is protected by law. If all vendors in your area share a similar belief, segregation would result.</comment>

<comment>but since taxes support the bakery (sidewalks, firemen, police, power grids, etc), they must serve all-no exceptions</comment>

<comment>They pay the taxes too.</comment>

<comment>irrelevant-no one is refusing them service. Its very simple-if taxes form EVERYONE support your business, you will serve EVERYONE. If you don't like it, you can make your business PRIVATE (ie women's only gyms)</comment>

<comment>Off topic and irrelevant to the discussion. </comment>

<comment>Not really. The public is not some impersonal force. It is all of us.</comment>

<comment>If a business is open to the public that business had no right to pick and choose who they will and will not do business with unless the cushioned bring turned away have broken a law. And the business owners religious proclivities do not constitute a law. </comment>

<comment>So you want to force a muslim bakery to bake a cake saying Jesus is the one and only true son of God?  .Also please tell me when your homosexual bullies go after a muslim bakery and try and force them to participate in their wedding.  What you wont do that...you coward and intolerant anti-Christian BIGOT.</comment>

<comment>I haven't found any Muslim bakeries. But, there's an awesome Halal butcher shop a few miles away that has amazing cuts of lamb and goat.The tone of your voice clearly showcases the poor quality of your tolerance. I am all for the right to practice ones religious beliefs in complete freedom. The rub comes when people claiming to be a christian begin to think that their religious views give them the right to deny any of the fundamental rights of any other person.I refuse to allow any so called christian the ability to claim special rights to deny service to another person merely due to some nebulous religious dogmatic notion.</comment>

<comment>Lady, can you make a legal argument to counter my legal argument, or are you so intolerant that you don't care who's fundamental rights you trample..homosexuals don't have fundamental rights (as I explained to you) but Christians DO. .Do us a favor and learn how to debate.</comment>

<comment>Unless you can show me where christians are favored over anyone else in any part of the constitution, then you are little more than a barn yard philosopher.</comment>

<comment>Hey lady, you made the charge that homosexuals are favored over anyone else, therefor the burden of proof is on you.  .I already explained how Christians are protected (not "favored") you LIAR.  I know your heroes obama and clintion (who both hated homosexuals up until a few years ago) lie all the time but that BS doesn't work with me.  SO stop lying you bigot.</comment>

<comment>Christians are not "protected" under our Constitution. No religion has the right to impose their views on society. You have as much right to practice your religion as anyone else has to practice theirs.Calling someone one, doesn't mean you aren't the bigot.</comment>

<comment>I made no such claim of favoritisim for the gay community. As far as I can recall, you've not "explained" anything to me at all. Rather, you have yelled at me and made baseless accusations and assumptions about me based on your own opinions.You have no clue what my voting history is. Nor am I required to deluge my voting history to you or anyone else.Nor have I made any claims that homosexuals are favored over any one else. Everyone in this country are equals, or should be, as far as constitutional law is concerned.I do not believe that one mans religion gives him the right to deny rights to any other man. I agree with Thomas Jefferson..."Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will. But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within   limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the  limits of the law,' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the right of an individual."   --Thomas Jefferson to Isaac H. Tiffany, 1819.</comment>

<comment>They could, but you have entirely missed the point. Presumably that bakery is in business to serve the public. It should serve all of the public, or none all. Could a bakery also refuse a cake to a Jewish couple? A mixed race couple? An Oriental couple? A handicapped couple? All those people would have access to other bakeries as well, but why should they not have a reasonable expectation of getting a cake at a bakery? Presumably that is why the bakery is in business. Why is that difficult to understand?</comment>

<comment>You assume all small towns have more than one option, and that the others would not share the same beliefs. That is how you get segregation.Laws that allow discrimination and segregation promote as valid the practice they indulge.</comment>

<comment>Why should they have to go somewhere else? This type of comment is usually the product of a person who has never faced any sort of discrimination in their life.</comment>

<comment>It's true, I've never been the victim of discrimination, and I'm sure I wouldn't like it. But in my view, freedom of religion trumps the (very understandable) desire to prevent gay people from feeling marginalized.</comment>

<comment>Oh, but I think you are experiencing discrimination because your strong religious beliefs are being brought into question  and based on your comment, you don't like it any more than that gay couple. The religious right will never win the right to oppress another group even though they have gotten away with it time and again for centuries. And, btw you do know the bible is a load of fairytales put to gother to control society in the dark ages.......right?</comment>

<comment>You are making assumptions. I'm an agnostic. But I believe in the Constitution, which includes freedom of religion.</comment>

<comment>Also, your view of religion is stunningly simplistic and uneducated.</comment>

<comment>I think religion was supposed to be simplistic in the beginning and as far as education, there are far more interesting things in the world to learn about that fairytales, ghosts and goblins that do not exist.</comment>

<comment>This was all localized too. It was never federal law.</comment>

<comment>Irrelevant if it is local. The Federal laws cover everyone.The couples could have made a complaint to the Civil Rights Division of the DOJ, or, used their local Civil Rights commissions. They chose the later.</comment>

<comment>it will be soon-praise Jeebus for that!</comment>

<comment>So you prefer fascist totalitarian sorts of governments. Nice to know.</comment>

<comment>whatever keeps you religious wackos heeled-im for that</comment>

<comment>More evidence of group think.</comment>

<comment>youre a delirious and a bitter old woman. Group think is you religious kooks being programmed since birth to hate minorities and never questioning it. Im just happy youre not long for this earth. We don't want you in the USA anymore, bigot.</comment>

<comment>Group think is you assuming you can generalize about people you don't know. Programmed to hate minorities? Where, pray tell? Certainly not in my home.</comment>

<comment>you hate gays-that's clear-you think of their coupling as less than straight couples-you've admitted that-you can color hatred any way you want, but the truth remains-you think gays are less than straights and destined for hellfire..thats more hateful than anything I have ever heard of!! Burning for being gay for all time? What do you consider hate, old woman??</comment>

<comment>Please control yourself. Where did I ever say that?  You are very arrogant if you think you know my emotions. I never ever talk about hellfire.Please try to practice better reading comprehension.</comment>

<comment>Your reading of the Civil Rights Act (if I'm reading YOU right) is dubious, you seem to be saying that discrimination against gays for religious reasons is religious discrimination. If it were that easy then a) anti-gay discrimination would already be--as you seem to be saying it is--illegal even where states don't have LGBT protections; yet no one but you seems to be aware of this; and b) the gay couples and individuals denied services would have used this argument--but I'm not aware of any that have. The cases I know of have relied on state LGBT anti-discrimination laws.One possible road out of this thicket lies in a little detail of one of the wedding cake cases; the court ruled that denying the cake constituted illegal discrimination, but noted that the situation might be different if the customers had, instead of requesting a "generic" cake any heterosexual might want, asked for a design that explicitly affirmed support for gay marriage--in which case the baker might have a First Amendment right to refuse to "say" something he didn't want to. Couple that with another case where a t-shirt maker refused to print shirts for an LGBT pride event. A lower court ruled he was discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation; on appeal the t-shirt guy won, the higher court judging that the "discrimination" was actually based on viewpoint (disagreement with the stated goals of the event) which was found to be legal.</comment>

<comment>you seem to be saying that discrimination against gays for religious reasons is religious discrimination.Yup. A business may not refuse service to someone because they are not an approved race, color, sex(except in limited cases), or religion. Period. Because a business denies a  customer because they disprove of their religion or the customer is not of an approved religious practice, that is illegal. In the cases of the photographer (New Mexico) and bakers (Colorado and Oregon), the owners all specifically refused on religious grounds.Standard procedure is you may only refuse service to a specific person if you would refuse a similar service to other customers. If you would refuse to serve someone with no shoes, you would not be able to serve anyone not wearing shoes. If you refuse the LGBT T-shirt because you don't print political messages, then you would have to be consistent on denying political messages. In your example, that is what the court found; the T-shirt printer refused to print other messages it disagreed with.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>I agree that religious motivations can't override anti-discrimination laws. What I am saying is that the part of the Civil Rights Act covering religious discrimination applies to the person who avows the religious beliefs. For all we know, the customers in your examples might have all been atheists. The plaintiffs in these cases didn't say that the discrimination against them was illegal because it was religiously-based; they argued it was illegal because the law forbids anti-LGBT discrimination, whatever the motivation. The religious nature of the discrimination wasn't an aid to their arguments; it was, in fact, a hurdle they had to overcome (which they did)As far as the barefoot customers go, it's a little dicey. Unless the barred customer can tie the action to some protected-class angle--as in "They let the barefoot white girls in, but since I'm African-American...!"--the ACLU isn't likely to take on the case. Absent that kind  of discriminatory intent, the reason one customer is told to come back with shoes and another is let in probably has to do with something as mundane as the cashier or owner seeing the first one as grungy and likely to hang around, and the second as more "middle-class" and acting like he or she is going to be quickly in and out.  When I worked in a small liquor store many years ago, we made that kind of subjective judgment all the time, but never on the "objective" basis of race, sexual orientation, whatever.And the t-shirt case? I agree with you and the appeals court judge, but remember, the lower decision went the other way. Meaning, I think the line between discrimination based on "status" versus "expression" is still in the uncertain stage, still a bit blurry and in need of bright-line, higher court clarification.</comment>

<comment>How can you now have anti LQBT laws when sexuality is now considered fluid? How do we know who is bi or how someone feels at the moment?</comment>

<comment>sexuality is not considered fluid for 99% of the people. It doesn't matter, though, all are to be treated equally.</comment>

<comment>Of course all are to be treated equally. Who said they wouldn't? However, the latest fashion is that gender is fluid; it is not set. We can all jump around to the different 57 sexes.</comment>

<comment>gender is only fluid for the small percentage of bisexuals</comment>

<comment>I don't care what you assume to be true; the latest fashions on campus declare sexuality is fluid. Someone can be male one day; the next day he can be female.</comment>

<comment>that's absurd-youre pulling that out of your old wrinkly butt</comment>

<comment>Check out any gender studies curriculum. Really; you must not get around much.</comment>

<comment>So the Soviet Union, atheist, was a paradise of love? How about Madeleine Murray O'Hare; whose own fellow atheists murdered her?You are mistaken if you think religions believe they are the only ones who tell people not to murder. People since before history have known murder is wrong. Yet anger is part of the human condition which the Bible points out to us. Religions codify these universal problems. There is no noble savage.</comment>

<comment>Madeline Murray...impressive!</comment>

<comment>I took your advice. But this is a crazy place.</comment>

<comment>I'm trying to enhance my neuronal plasticity.</comment>

<comment>Madeleine Murray O'Hair (note correct spelling) was not murdered by fellow atheists.  She was murdered by thugs who stole the gold that she and her children had kept their life savings in.  Your comment is both ignorant and absurd.</comment>

<comment>Who were her fellow compatriots. No great loving people there. I was refuting the assertion that religion somehow creates hate instead of it being a product of human nature.</comment>

<comment>It is a good point that religion does not create hate (which is the result of evolutionary path dependence or original sin if that's your perspective), but it does justify and direct hate. To be humane, fair and loving (love being the opposite of hate) we need to be better than our biology or our religion.</comment>

<comment>Please show some evidence that the murderers were her compatriots.</comment>

<comment>Religion is a product of human nature. It is based on the need for people to try to understand things that they don't understand. Throughout history humans have created concepts of gods to explain those things. Their religious texts then codified the mores of the times. That is why the penalty for just about any infraction in the bile is death. Someone commits adultery, stone them to death, a child disrespects their parents, stone them to death, you can make more. That is also why slavery is perfectly OK in the bible.The point is that each society creates its own moral rules and to rely on rules in a book from thousands of years ago can lead people to do evil things, since the concept of morality was very different when it was written.</comment>

<comment>These old laws show how violent the past really was. If you choose to go that route of discussing evolutionary anthropology; I can discuss it from that perspective too. So can God. :-). Jane Goodall said that when she first began observing chimpanzees; she thought perhaps they might prove to be better than humans. Instead, she found them to be just as bad. Thus violence seems to be encoded into our natures. Christians would call this original sin; others might call it something else. However you seem to be so deep into your sneering mode that you, unlike a properly thinking anthropologist who eschews such an emotional definition, cannot grudgingly grant the observation any sort of wisdom.Jewish people, who have the Old Testament to follow; which seems quite violent compared to the New; have always had lower rates of incarceration, at least for violent crimes than the rest of the populations they have lived amongst. So I guess there are ways of following the lessons of the Bible using the violence as more of a metaphor. There is insight there which you seem loathe to admit.</comment>

<comment>Wrong again, SophieB. They were EMPLOYEES, not "members" or "compatriots".  They were also convicted felons, which calls her judgement into question about hiring them in the first place.  But they were not atheists nor members of her organization.  Honestly, don't you know how to use the Google?</comment>

<comment>Why use Google when your misconceptions and bigotry are ingrained.  You may be forced to change your mind, which seems to be the big sin in many fundamentalist's minds.  Nope, don't use Google, just keep repeating and repeating the garbled version of truth you live by and maybe someday it will be true.  lol</comment>

<comment>Ingrained? How nice to be so judgmental without the least bit of embarrassment.</comment>

<comment>religion sodalities hate (the bible is VERY misogynistic and racist and hateful)</comment>

<comment>Nice comment completely devoid of critical thinking or insight.</comment>

<comment>so tell us why you support a god who at one time ordered women to marry her rapist? Your ok with a god that hates you? that makes no sense, woman!</comment>

<comment>there were actually millions in the Soviet Union who practiced religion (hint- a regime's religion or lack thereof is NOT what the country is.)</comment>

<comment>I doubt millions. The ones who did had to practice it under the radar or they would be discriminated against.</comment>

<comment>it was millions, ma'am, despite what you doubt</comment>

<comment>You know this because....?</comment>

<comment>I know how to google (hint-google religious belief in the soviet union 1940s to 1989)</comment>

<comment>There are probably many interpretations of that. Might be something interesting to research.  Don't believe everything you read. You might find alternate opinions.</comment>

<comment>Wow; you imagine you know the thoughts of large groups of people. How very much into thought control you must be.</comment>

<comment>Your beliefs about history ignore that many cultures accepted same sex couples and same sex bonding, despite the popular claims to the contrary. There have always been gay people around the world, and many have accepted that fact, despite the desire of others to punish those who are different from themselves.</comment>

<comment>"Any fight involving the religious right is bound to get nasty."Of course it will.  They're clinging to an antiquated philosophy and the myths created to sustain it.  Consequently, they've convinced themselves they are being backed into a corner by some calculated, "PC" conspiracy.  Like rats they strike out desperately, growing ever more aware of their inevitable demise.It's not surprising.  When one embraces a worldview without foundation in reason or fact, particularly if it became ingrained in childhood through the manipulations of parental authorities, one has the luxury of erroneous, yet unquestionable, certainty.  "God's will/word" permits limitless justification for any actions man desires to take, since the authority it is predicated upon is vapor - manipulable into whatever form necessary to rationalize anything from beheading to not "allow[ing] gay people to be gay."</comment>

<comment>My religious faith, if I take it seriously, reserves certainty for God, not for me. And it points out that my own psychology can run rings around any external factor, as far as manipulation of oneself and others, self justification for bad causes, projection of blame onto others, and a host of other self destructive tendencies. None of us are free. Freedom is hard. Something there is in human nature that likes walls, and boxes, and boxing other people out. That's not good. My faith offers a seemingly contradictory path out of what bogs us all down. I don't expect you to buy it, its foundations are not material, after all. Just giving you some perspective from how it works in my mind and heart, for what that is worth.But I have nothing these days against gays being as gay as they want, or are.</comment>

<comment>And do the same for others.  WE live in a secular society</comment>

<comment>We do let them alone. They don't let others alone.</comment>

<comment>Religious fundamentalists want to enact laws giving them the right to discriminate. That's hardly leaving gays alone.If you have a public business with a business license to do business with the general public then gays are included as they pay taxes too. This was settled long ago with Jim Crow laws in the south being used to discriminate against blacks.</comment>

<comment>nope-if your business is open to the public, it is OPEN TO THE PUBLIC</comment>

<comment>Which they all do; serving everyone. Businesses have always had the choice, however; to opt out of doing stuff they disagreed with. Tattoo artists also have certain tattoos which they refuse to do. The Amish could refuse making certain types of quilts which go against their religion as could Orthodox Jews, strict Muslims, etc. How about Muslims refusing to transport seeing eye dogs? Someone could easily claim they were practicing some sort of hate crime against the handicapped.I personally would not feel offended if the local kosher delicatessen did not provide a service I requested which was against their policy. Only the LBQT crowd runs around bullying everyone. I could care less if businesses love me or not.</comment>

<comment>youre obviously a straight white woman who has ZERO idea of what discrimination is-that's very sad and tragic. The gays do not bully-we just got tired of religious nonsense and decided to fight the bigots and we have won in every court case. Turns out, we were right all along-gays are equal people!! Remember, your kind said the EXACT same thing about blacks bullying innocent whites to serve them-and you lost then too. Maybe this isn't the country for you?</comment>

<comment>My kind of what? Once again you establish your bigotry big time by assuming stuff about me you know nothing about.Gays bully all the time. I would like to know why we even have to discuss someone's sexual preferences at all. We are not walking bundles of genitals; we are human beings. Therefore why must I even know if some ball player is gay or not? That neither makes him a bad person or a good person. It is his character which should matter. BTW, why are gays so obsessed with genitalia anyway? My son catered a gay carnival; it was filled with such silly games such as toss ring on the giant pnis, etc.</comment>

<comment>your kind simply means someone who chooses to be bigoted against people for no reason except your religious programming. I dont assume-you've proven your backwardness numerous times on this post. Im not bullying anyone-I just don't take religious nonsense form anyone anymore. We discuss someone's' sexual ORIENTATION because your kind wouldn't give us full equality. So we demanded it and beat your kind. Humans like sex-sorry youre barren and sexless at your age, but every human likes their genitalia</comment>

<comment>You assume you know something about me from what?? That is backward; the inability to discuss objective ideas without resorting to ad hominin.Many serious students of the law even those who are gay don't appreciate the recent Supreme Court ruling. In fact; it was a bunch of jabber; embarrassing; it sounded like it was written by a twelve year old. Not much legal argument there. Sad.Actually, I have usually favored Rand Paul's argument about marriage. Get the government out of it.</comment>

<comment>educated folk do not discuss equality with anyone who uses that silly "my god done said shit"-its claptrap and imbecilic. VAST majority support the SC's decision</comment>

<comment>What an elegant argument. Educated people do not argue using such terminology.</comment>

<comment>Most of this post could apply to Democrats and their continued embrace of failed 19th century social policy. To disagree now is heretical.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm not a Democrat, but I still think your over-generalized partisanship is patently false here.  Any secular philosophy has to have a logical foundation.  The burden is on whomever articulates the beliefs to prove the truth of the foundation."Religious" philosophies are given a pass at this basic stage.  My point is really, if you want to base policy on God's will, prove God's existence first.  Fail that task, and you don't get to pretend to argue from it's authority.</comment>

<comment>R'amen.</comment>

<comment>Following your argument, no valid policy would exist, as they would be all based on relative principles. You clearly never thought about this for even five seconds.</comment>

<comment>To the contrary.  The validity of a policy is a subsequent determination, only made after a foundation in fact has been established.  If there is no foundation in fact, any policy stemming from it is ipso facto invalid.</comment>

<comment>OK. I overestimated you. Forget it.</comment>

<comment>"embrace of failed 19th century social policy"Says the guy who spouts eugenics</comment>

<comment>No, I don't, and that's an odd response. I think you may have me mixed up with someone else. </comment>

<comment>I am the only Bettenguy, and I have never supported eugenics or anything close to it. I leave that stuff to the Margaret Sanger acolytes.</comment>

<comment>'faith' by definition is belief without evidence. god is only on paper till we see otherwise. the social policy is an actual thing, it has evidence. we have a secular legal system that applies to everyone equally faith or not.</comment>

<comment>There's plenty of evidence that our social programs are not only fiscally unsustainable, they also don't do what they are tasked to do. Of course, any attempts at serious reform is met with howls on the left and videos of the poor and elderly being pushed off a cliff. Is that a reason or emotion based defense?</comment>

<comment>nope-theyre fine</comment>

<comment>Then explain why a Democratic president signed on to Welfare reform?</comment>

<comment>Because he had lost huge in the mid terms and his hand was forced?</comment>

<comment>Then it obviously wasn't heretical.  Do you even know what that means?</comment>

<comment>Yes I do. You should also understand what I said above was in response to a specific example. From over 20 years ago. Which means it doesn't change my point about Democrat beliefs today.</comment>

<comment>Wow, it's the Democrats who embrace "failed 19th century social policy"? That's so bizarre it's like everything Orwell warned against.  No, bettenguy, it's the Republicans who want to return to the 19th century.  Nice try, though.</comment>

<comment>That's dumb-there are no policies in effect from the 19th century (hint-women, blacks and gays now have full equality)</comment>

<comment>What failed 19th century social policy?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I know, Teddy Roosevelt is such a poor role model.</comment>

<comment>TR would be aghast at the size of our social programs and the dependency and destruction it has caused.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. Progressives are called that because they use facts and evidence to make policy decisions. It is conservatives who want to continue to try failed policies. For example, social security has been the most important factor in reducing poverty among senior citizens. Conservatives were against it when it was passed, claiming that it would lead to a collapse of society, and continue to do whatever they can to try to destroy it.Conservatives want to privatize just about every public service, in spite of the fact that in most cases doing so has not only NOT made those services more efficient, but has made them more expensive. They rely on the "free market" with no regulation, when it is known that the assumptions underlying efficient operation of a free market don't exist in the real world and without regulation markets tend to consolidate into oligopolies or monopolies, reducing service and driving up prices. They continue to believe that cutting taxes for the wealthy will increase economic activity and pay for itself, when history has proven that cutting taxes for the wealthy does NOTHING to stimulate the economy and always just increases the federal deficit.</comment>

<comment>Did you really just argue against privatizing programs like Social Security because to subject it to the free market would make it less efficient because it would end up a single payer monopoly? Lol. You guys don't even understand your own inept arguments.By the way, feel free to compare the US economic growth in the 60's and 80's after massive tax cuts to now. Those era's win hands down.</comment>

<comment>Those are separate issues. My discussion of Social Security was totally separate from my comment about privatizing and deregulation. Republicans haven't been just fighting to privatize social security since its inception. They have been saying that it would never work and that it should be eliminated. That is not consistent with reality.However, privatizing social security is a bad idea because it subjects individuals to the vicissitudes of the market, if they even put anything aside to begin with. Before there was social security poverty among seniors was rampant. Social security was effective in significantly reducing that poverty. Privatizing also means that there is someone skimming profits off the top of the program, taking money that would otherwise be spent providing benefits.My second paragraph consisted of 3 separate issues. I know that conservatives have trouble with facts, but try to learn to read. mentioned 3 bad ideas that are the core of conservative economic policies and why they are bad ideas. They are 1 privatizing all public services, 2 eliminating all industry regulations, and 3 cutting taxes for the wealthy. Not one of those things has helped the economy in any way, and when they have been tried they have hurt the majority of people while benefiting a tiny majority. Republican economic policies have resulted in the biggest transfer of wealth from the poor and middle class to the wealthy since the days of the robber barons. The 1% are the real takers in the current economy. They have rigged the market so that they suck up all the benefits of economic activity at the expense of the workers through whose efforts profits are generated.</comment>

<comment>I think you're confusing Christ with the Beatles.On many ethical matters, particularly sexual behavior, Christ was even more strict than the religious leaders of his day.</comment>

<comment>Where are these words of christ to defend that statement?</comment>

<comment>In Matthew 5:21-22, Jesus likens unforgiving anger againstone’s brother to murder.  In Matt 5:27-30, he says that anyone who lusts after a woman has committed adultery, and goes on to say that if your eye causes you to stumble, you should pluck it out.In Mark 10:2-12, Jesus refers to the Genesis creation account as authoritatively prescriptive for marriage (“God made them male and female”). He says that divorcing one’s spouse is adultery, a view that was more extreme than the one held by the Pharisees, who were okay with divorce as long as youprovided a certificate. Even his disciples questioned the severity of such a statement (Matthew 19:10).In Matthew 22:37-40, Jesus said that the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and mind. 1 John 5:3 says that loving God means keeping his commandments, something also alluded to in John 14.If you focus only on Jesus’ love (or more accurately, on a modernized, feel-good version of what you think love is) you miss the gospel entirely. Jesus came to earth because God’s expectations and condemnation of sin were so great, so that he could pay the price for the terrible things people do.  Trusting in Jesus doesn’t mean just being all lovey-dovey about him and others around you – it means trusting in the fact that Jesus died a horrible death that you deserved because of your sin.</comment>

<comment>"Trusting in Jesus doesn’t mean just being all lovey-dovey about him and others around you – it means trusting in the fact that Jesus died a horrible death that you deserved because of your sin.""Sin" is a ridiculous concept.</comment>

<comment>According to the Bible, denying sin is also ridiculous - 1 John 1:8.</comment>

<comment>I deny it. My faith doesn't believe in sin. Nor do I believe in some invisible dude in the sky.</comment>

<comment>Psalm 14:1 describes you as foolish, then. I hope you'll reconsider at some point, for your own sake.</comment>

<comment>please stop quoting a book written by old rich primitive people-makes you look stupid</comment>

<comment>Please stop being so close-minded. It makes you look stupid.</comment>

<comment>my mind is wide open, pal-im far more educated on the bible than youll ever be (hint-all atheists are bible experts-that's how they become atheists!)</comment>

<comment>Even so, even if we take it as a book of fairy tales, nowhere in the New Testament does it indicate one should shield oneself from sinners based on economic circumstances. Not participate in sin with the sinner - check - that I can understand, but providing a wedding cake in return for money is not participation. If anything it is zero-sum. Cake for money. Providing a gift of a cake, maybe that could be viewed as abetting sin, still though, the people most likely to quote the Bible seem the least able to read it intelligently, as miserably written and edited a book that it is.</comment>

<comment>Rest assured that the "book written by old rich primitive people" will far outlive your insignificant ramblings and insults.</comment>

<comment>nope-its already dead in the educated western world-thank Jeebus for that!!</comment>

<comment>Christians don't believe in some dude either.</comment>

<comment>So you have met this dude personally. Swell. Maybe you can describe him/her.</comment>

<comment>He is not a dude with physical dimensions. He exists beyond the physical.</comment>

<comment>That's  your weak mind speaking-you fear death-youre afraid-we get it-but we simply wont allow your primitive thinking into our governance-im sorry</comment>

<comment>Then you prove your totalitarian mind control bent.  The Founding Fathers, even if they were Deists, always approved of allowing religious thought in the public square. Thomas Jefferson said that basically it "makes no difference if my neighbors believes in no gods or many gods; it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket" or something to that effect. Abraham Lincoln opened a Cabinet meeting by announcing he had prayed over the topic. FDR led the nation in prayer over the radio during D-Day.  None of these people was requiring people adopt any sort of religion; but they were exercising their freedom of speech.</comment>

<comment>the problem, ma'am, is that your kind was pushing religious views into law and harming many people and trying to use religion as justification for denying rights. So we pushed back and found that religious nonsense had pervaded a lot of this country. Now its just clean up.</comment>

<comment>Have you even heard of federalism? No one pushes religion into national laws. There is very little in local laws either. When was the last time you heard of Americans stoning someone for adultery? Yet it happens all the time in majority Islam countries. Those are countries who rule by religious doctrine; completely the opposite from what our Constitution guarantees. In fact, the first Amendment was designed to protect churches from the overreach of the federal government. The Founding Fathers saw the problems with theocracies in Europe.</comment>

<comment>wrong-that's extreme naiveté! There was LOTS of Christian kookery in our laws-ever heard of anti-sodomy laws? yeah-religious foundation.  we Trust" on our money? Yeah-religious nonsense to counter communism. Anti-gay laws were ALL inspired by religious haters because "my god done said da gays were sinner, durp"-clean up!!</comment>

<comment>Wise up yourself. This was all done locally. part of federalism. There was never a federal law about sodomy.</comment>

<comment>So man wasn't created in his image. Gotcha.</comment>

<comment>This is not referring to literalness.</comment>

<comment>No, it is referring to the claim that your god is an invisible dude in the sky. You denied that. OK, so literally, the Christian Bible states that man was created in your god's image. But then it is well known how well Christians follow their holy book.</comment>

<comment>Not invisible. That would still assume physical properties. Beyond physical definition entirely as He created physical laws. This is not a literal physical. Well perhaps you think that way if you are six years old .......</comment>

<comment>So you claim the bible is wrong. Gotcha.</comment>

<comment>No, the Bible describes God as a Spirit without physical form. All major theologians, both Christian & Jewish, do so also.</comment>

<comment>If man was created in his image then man is also without physical form. Yet, because we know that man has form, that would mean the Bible is wrong. But that can't be because the Bible is perfect. Then that would mean you are wrong. And yes that is probable.</comment>

<comment>Don't be a literalist. It is not becoming.</comment>

<comment>According to Dianetics, sin is, uh.. well I haven't actually read Dianetics, but it's just as relevant as the Bible (which I've read several translations of).</comment>

<comment>Given that the article we're commenting on is about matters of religious freedom, the best-selling (religious) book of all time seems highly relevant.</comment>

<comment>Like I keep saying, it's just a number's game.</comment>

<comment>Dianetics has not formed the basis for western civilization.</comment>

<comment>neither has the bible</comment>

<comment>But it's just as not-credible, weird, and downright silly.Oh, and ancient Greece formed the basis of Western Civilization. Xtianity was a relative late-comer.</comment>

<comment>according to the bible, if your e a woman, you must marry your rapist-oh wait-that was the old, angry god-god changed its mind somewhere and became nicer or something? its all rubbish</comment>

<comment>Wow, Norman, you sure devastated me with that one.</comment>

<comment>because youre a misogynist I assume...</comment>

<comment>"Trusting in Jesus doesn’t mean just being all lovey-dovey about him and others around you – it means trusting in the fact that Jesus died a horrible death that you deserved because of your sin."Christianity as snuff porn.  Very nice.</comment>

<comment>Imagine how churches would look (inside and out) if Jesus had been executed by the electric chair, lol. There would also be lots of people wearing little electric chairs on their lapels and sporting them on necklaces.It does seem rather fetishistic.</comment>

<comment>Hhmmm, have you ever sat on a cross?</comment>

<comment>My lawyer has advised me to plead the 5th.</comment>

<comment>Ya, well, not as comfy as a chair.</comment>

<comment>As someone once said"Sin is short for 'Since I'm Not' (doing/having/getting any)"</comment>

<comment>Reminds me of the best definition I've heard for the term "slut," which was "someone who has more sex than I do!"</comment>

<comment>"Sin is a ridiculous concept."And yet you probably think discriminating against homosexuals is a sin, Biggus.</comment>

<comment>No, I think it's an example of reactionary bigotry, ignorance, and evidence of low intelligence (which correlates nicely with bigotry and ignorance).</comment>

<comment>I'm confused that Jesus died for my sins. Dang, he died two millennium before I was born. How does he know that I would sin?</comment>

<comment>For He is precocious!</comment>

<comment>I thought he was dead.</comment>

<comment>For He was precocious!</comment>

<comment>Well, that explains the dog's breakfast you have made of your life.</comment>

<comment>That's a strange thing to post.Was it the meanest thing you could think of at the time, or does it reveal the actual limit of your creative imagination? If it's the latter, you have my sincere condolences.In any case if what you wrote is true then the dog in question must have had a breakfast of pure awesomeness, lol.</comment>

<comment>And yet you know what evil is... which is a product of sin.</comment>

<comment>I'm a big fan of Matthew 19:12. None of the Christians and Catholics practice it nearly enough.</comment>

<comment>Plenty of Christians live celibate lives. What are you suggesting?</comment>

<comment>that theyre ugly?</comment>

<comment>But nowhere in your dissertation and the New Testament as a whole is there an admonition to boycott and not engage a sinner. If anything the opposite. The current fetish, and yes, I do use that word, to not serve gays, is based on a primordial lizard-brain fear and not any clear thinking.</comment>

<comment>Who is saying sinners should be boycotted and ignored? Jesus ate with sinners and taxpayers, etc.--some of the least popular folks of his day.  But what he didn't do was condone what they were doing. The opposite, in fact: he told people to stop sinning when they were doing so. As I pointed out in my "dissertation," Jesus raised the bar on sexual ethical behavior, rather than lowering it.If someone believes that a same-sex marriage is wrong, they should have the right to refrain from participating in that marriage without fear of losing their livelihood. But today there are folks saying that the right to have a cake at your wedding trumps someone else's right to live out their faith in your everyday life. "If you don't come to my wedding with your camera and a smile and pretend in front of all my guests that you are okay with what's going on here, I will sue you and you will lose your business." That's pretty much what going on, here: "If you don't accept my lifestyle, I will do everything I can to destroy you."</comment>

<comment>So, Jesus didn't smile and make small talk when he mooched a meal? Indeed, that is a new revelation.</comment>

<comment>"it means trusting in the fact that Jesus died a horrible death that you deserved because of your sin." - But was it the most horrible death in the past and yet to be written future history of mankind? If some human, somewhere, died a more horrible death than Jesus doesn't that invalidate the supposed "sacifice"? Myself, I am astounded Jesus got off with such a light sentence, any administration with a proper execution protocol could have kept him alive for months of torture before heading for the final exit. Maybe the Romans weren't as competent as history judges them.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it was, Yacko. The greatest injustice in history was when sinful men killed the perfect Son of God. Your focus on the specific "torture technique" causes you to miss the forest for the trees.</comment>

<comment>there was no son of god-that's silly</comment>

<comment>There is very little to support this. The Pauline Letters do not purport to be the word of Christ, and in the four gospels, there is very little about sexual morality. What there was about sexual morality was very much of the judge not lest ye be judged type.While Christ was absolutely a religious hardliner, he was hard-line about other things, for example giving up all material wealth and giving up connections to the material world.</comment>

<comment>I wasn't speaking about the Pauline epistles -- I didn't even mention them. See my response to OhSoGood for examples of where Jesus held even stronger views on sexual morality than those held by the legalistic Pharisees.</comment>

<comment>So looking at your reply, there are essentially two passages you are relying on to say that Christ was a hardliner on sexual morality: Matthew 5:27-30 (basically that lustful looks are as bad as adultery) and Mark 10:2-12 (divorce is prohibited essentially because God created both men and women). I'll certainly grant that the passage from Matthew speaks to sexual morality in a thought-police kind of way, but I would suggest that the passage from Mark is much more a question of social structure, that is whether divorce should be legal, rather than a question of sexual morality per se. I will also note to your point about the Pharisees, the passage from Mark says they came to test Christ, not necessarily that they disagreed with his conclusion or that Christ was more severe than them.I still don't think this amounts to much proof that He was more of a sexual moralizer than the Pharisees.</comment>

<comment>Matthew 5:27-30 speaks to sexual morality. Your critique of the angle it takes ("thought-police") in no way negates that fact.Mark 10:2-12 and parallel references in the other synoptic gospels (Matthew 19 & Luke 16) speak about marriage and divorce, which can be considered matters of sexual ethics on a social scale. Marriage and divorce exist primarily as indicators/regulators of sexual behavior. In fact, Jesus confirmed that marriage and divorce are matters of sexual ethics when he brought up adultery after all the Pharisees had asked him about was divorce (which is in your mind--and perhaps the first-century Pharisees' as well--"more a question of social structure").These passages do strike me as strong evidence that Christ was quite conservative when it came to sexual ethics - expectations were very high. Feel free to provide me with evidence to the contrary -- after all, you're the one who seems to be trying to counter two thousand years of orthodox Christian doctrine here, and you've also admitted that "Christ was absolutely a religious hardliner" while providing zero evidence that sexual ethics should be excluding from his "hard-lining."</comment>

<comment>Jesus was not conservative-he supported sinners, fed the poor and was against money lenders</comment>

<comment>Don't make the mistake of conflating "conservative" with "Republican," especially when you're looking at ancient history.</comment>

<comment>in todays world, conservative means republican in terms of politics-they've definitely twisted it with religious nonsense in order to get the mindless sheep to support them</comment>

<comment>So. . . I describe a Jewish religious leader from the first century A.D. as "conservative regarding sexual ethics," and your response was effectively "No, Jesus wasn't a Republican -- he cared about people!"It is now abundantly clear that we are working from two different planes. Have a good day, Norm.</comment>

<comment>why would you use quotations around something I didn't say? weirdo</comment>

<comment>It's called a paraphrase, bud.</comment>

<comment>you don't place quotes around a paraphrase, bud-you only put them around-wait for it-a DIRECT QUOTE</comment>

<comment>Ah yes, I think I'll start taking grammar and punctuation lessons from the man who ignores capitalization rules, uses hyphens where he should use em dahes, and thinks periods are optional.  From the man who criticizes others for using quotation marks for purposes other than direct quotes when he himself does the same thing on a regular basis-- at least three times over the last week alone, in fact:Anti-gay laws were ALL inspired by religious haters because "my god done said da gays were sinner, durp"-clean up!!no educated person would buy that "talked to god" [expletive]-expect thousands more to leave that ridiculous cult, you silly old white men!!!because they are based on reality-not "my god done said" nonsense!!No thanks, Norman. I see right through your inconsistencies, confusions, and conflations, and I reject it all. Given how regularly you rely on weak connections and poor logic,  I strongly suggest that you take a step back and re-examine the views you hold so dearly.</comment>

<comment>"they are a bunch of hate-filled hypocrites"Well, aren't you an open-minded sweetheart!</comment>

<comment>Actions speak louder than words. When it come to the religious, their actions throughout history shout little more than bloody hate and hypocrisy. It is past time to move past the rantings of apocalyptic desert peasant preachers. </comment>

<comment>Apparently you don't understand the vast majority of the religious right. And it's interesting that you feel justified in dismissing a whole class of people using an inaccurate stereotype.</comment>

<comment>So you can see inside people's minds? How very fascist of you.</comment>

<comment>youre using "fascism" incorrectly, ma'am</comment>

<comment>Hardly. The Left, with its collectivism, must control large groups of people.  To control large groups of people; you must treat them as one collective mind; punishing individual thought which deviates. One way you do this is through very emotional rhetoric. What is the proscription against hate speech but something emotional? Nazism plus communism, are different flavors of the same coin; both fascist.</comment>

<comment>No, truly. The left isn't trying to control anyone-they fight control exerted by mindless religious people who think they have righteousness on their side. No one cares about collective thought-in fact, that's religion and must be avoided. You must think for yourself. I think its too late for old dogs like yourself, but we will train the younger generation to be better. And it works-far fewer racists now than in the 60s. And as your kind goes away, there will be far fewer bigots against gays.</comment>

<comment>What is training the younger generation but spreading the ideas of collective thought? It is no one's business to tell other people's children what to think. Most Christians just want to be left alone.You should try reading Ayn Rand about the dangers of collective thought; which has been going on since Plato.</comment>

<comment>religious indoctrination for children is very dangerous-thast why many parents aren't doing that anymore-that group think is indeed dangerous and wicked-kids should learn about ALL religions then choose or not choose when older.</comment>

<comment>The indoctrination comes from your side; the anger at peaceful religious families is palpable.</comment>

<comment>Sorry to say, you're mistaken: it's about spiritual love not the carnal.</comment>

<comment>I suppose it is loving to judge others on such a large scale.</comment>

<comment>Love doesn't mean saying everything is okay. Love doesn't mean turning your back on your beliefs to be seen as cool or hip.</comment>

<comment>Love means denying someone else's love in order to, what, validate your own superior form of love?Love could mean accepting someone regardless of how their beliefs differ from your own. Love could mean making room those differences without compromising on your core beliefs.</comment>

<comment>When I hear things like this, I'm just reminded of the things abusive spouses say.Sodomy laws to criminalize consensual fucking behind closed doors?  Just an expression of love!DADT to keep gay soldiers out of the armed forces, and to kick out good soldiers just because they're gay?  Just an expression of love!Reparative therapy to drive gay kids to suicide?  Just an expression of love!Marriage bans to stop us from being there for each other in our dying moments (because you certainly won't be)?  Just an expression of love!Yeah.  Your "love" sounds like the basis for a restraining order.</comment>

<comment>Historical background that very few people, except those directly involved a generation ago, know:The battle to enact a gay rights bill took 17 years in Massachusetts. Wisconsin was actually the first state to enact such a bill, but no state followed its lead for years thereafter. Activists needed Massachusetts to enact in order to gain traction in other progressively inclined states. But the bill stalled, bitterly, until 1989. It was not *only* the Roman Catholic hierarchy and its lackeys in the state legislature leadership who were the source of opposition. People nowadays forget that the Christian Science church once wielded considerable influence on Beacon Hill when it wanted to, and Massachusetts had lots of socially conservative "Reagan Democrats" (who elected Ed King as governor in 1978), and elected representatives and senators who shared their views.During the last few months of negotiations over the bill, a state senator from Malden introduced an amendment (understood to be prompted by the RC church and the CS church, among others) to broaden the exemptions religiously affiliated organizations had from existing anti-discrimination laws. It was intended as a poison pill, and detonated (to mix metaphors) in in the gay activist caucus at the time. I witnessed and on occasion participated in those discussions. Ultimately, a divided caucus decided the amendment had to be accepted for the bill to pass, with some of us arguing that there was some lemonade to be made from the lemon (again to mix metaphors), obviously unrealized by proponents of the amendment: As it turned out, the poison pill hoisted gay rights opponents on their own petards, because that very amendment ended up shielding the gay rights law from referendum and initiative processes under the state constitution, which has a relatively conservative approach to what can and cannot be subject to those processes (and religious rights are one of those things that cannot be).Without that amendment, the MA gay rights bill would have taken years more to pass, and other progressively inclined states would likely have take that much longer. Et cet.</comment>

<comment>States can, and the Federal government can, because we must. Religious freedom is incredibly important. So is the right to live and work with dignity without regard to your race or gender or orientation. We can get there from here. It won't be perfect. But it's not a zero sum game. We're all in this together.</comment>

<comment>religion will always be secondary to reality-we cant make laws based on "my god done said" because its all nonsense</comment>

<comment>But we've already made laws like that--"As a trucker I will transport any goods you assign to me--except alcohol, because 'my god done said' I can't." Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act is that law.Religious accommodations and exemptions have been part of the legal landscape for decades; all we're arguing about now is parameters.</comment>

<comment>sure, but that employee with silly religious convictions wont be hired-pretty simple</comment>

<comment>Well, the employer better have a good story ready before he gets up on the witness stand, or he's going to end up like the trucker's boss, trying to figure out how to pay a judgment in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</comment>

<comment>he will-he'll just lie like bigots do when they dont hire blacks or gays-"found someone else"-the problem with bigots is that they think theyre above reproach so they stupidly admit they wont hire gays because theyre gay!! Their idiocy is their ruin-and that's pretty funny :-)</comment>

<comment>Depends if you view religious freedom as something more than as an excuse to take rights away from fellow Americans.I love religious freedom, I hate when it's boiled down to "I should be allowed to ban the gays because my book says so!"</comment>

<comment>One's faith is a personal matter.  The episode with the four times married KY clerk was a blatant attempt to force her particular beliefs on others through the force of government; e.g., an abomination of justice.</comment>

<comment>This. What her supporters would not or could not understand was that as a government agent, her actions were a violation of the 1A.</comment>

<comment>For me personally, that's not even the most repugnant part of that little episode. What really irks me is that she prevented her fellow/deputy clerks from issuing marriage licenses. To say that she abused her government authority would be a total understatement.</comment>

<comment>She also spent five days enjoying the government largess. At least she was there for taco Tuesday.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention her $80,000/year salary. She probably got some good burritos and fine wine while at it too in addition to the Tacos</comment>

<comment>The issue with Davis is she is part of the government. She has both a monopoly and the power of physical force behind her. If she'd been running a business subject to the free market it wouldn't have been an issue.</comment>

<comment>My only obligation to someone else's rights is to leave them free to exercise them by not assaulting/harassing them.  When you think your rights require me to serve you then you've stepped past your rights and begun to infringe mine.  I don't care what any Court or document says, my only obligation to you is to leave you in peace.  I do not exist to help you exercise your rights.</comment>

<comment>wow-still so dumb-your rights are subject to limits in the public sphere-for example, a public business owned by you is subject to all PA laws (why? my taxes support your business so you will serve me, god or no god)</comment>

<comment>A limit to my right is a restriction on its exercise, not an action I am compelled to take.  Also, I'd never be foolish enough to be a public business, I'd be a members only establishment.</comment>

<comment>yep-that's smart!!</comment>

<comment>There's one question on this issue I keep coming back to:  Why is homosexuality THE sin that requires the ability to discriminate against, and not any of the other myriad "crimes" of Christianity?  I mean, they don't demand the right to fire all unwed mothers, unfaithful fathers, or unrepentant coveters.</comment>

<comment>Power and ease.Don't be too hasty, single mothers still face a lot of shit in the US and much of it is due to misogyny, racism (particularly against black single mothers) and religious ideology.We still think that single motherhood "naturally" leads to poverty while ignoring all the European countries with their much higher single motherhood rates with not as many of their mothers in poverty.</comment>

<comment>"single mothers still face a lot of shit in the US"Sure, but nobody's trying to pass legislation so that they can be legally discriminated against.  Unless, I missed the cries of "You can't make me bake a cake for that bastard's birthday!"</comment>

<comment>"Sure, but nobody's trying to pass legislation so that they can be legally discriminated against. "I don't know..."As governor of Florida in 2001, Bush had the opportunity to test his theory on public shaming. He declined to veto a very controversial bill that required single mothers who did not know the identity of the father to publish their sexual histories in a newspaper before they could legally put their babies up for adoption. He later signed a repeal of the so-called "Scarlet Letter" law in 2003 after it was successfully challenged in court."http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>Good god.</comment>

<comment>That isn't funny, but I find myself laughing because the self righteousness of these "religious" nimrods that praise Jeebus but ignore his message. What people do in the name of Jeebus.Thank you for sharing that.</comment>

<comment>yeah, isn't that nuts?  Making people take out a newspaper ad in order to put a baby up for adoption?  Crazy</comment>

<comment>So you are setting yourself up as some sort of judge? The Bible says a lot about the hypocrisy of people who judge others. We can judge behavior but only God can judge souls.</comment>

<comment>Hey, and that moron is running for President. Woohoo!</comment>

<comment>Lucky for us, he's running a very, very sad campaign</comment>

<comment>Lol, come to Mississippi and see if black single mothers are being discriminated against.</comment>

<comment>We still think that single motherhood "naturally" leads to poverty while ignoring all the European countries with their much higher single motherhood rates with not as many of their mothers in poverty.You must be equating single-parenting with unmarried parenting.  Europe has many more unmarried parents, but only 10% of households, on average, are single-parent households - well lower than the US.  Single parents also struggle in Europe.http://www.rand.org/content/da...</comment>

<comment>They do, but they're better off there than here, the actual crux of what I'm saying troll.</comment>

<comment>That probably depends a lot on where they are; in the European north, yes.  In the south, not so much.  Europe is not homogenous.In the European north, single parenting is also qualitatively different from what it is in America and Britain.  It's usually the result of divorce or separation.  That happens in the American and British middle classes as well.  But what you don't see a lot of in Scandinavia, Belgium and the Netherlands are single women with several children by different fathers, a phenomenon that's rampant in in the American lower class, and probably reflects social pathologies that are simply not prevalent in northern Europe, making any simple comparisons problematic.</comment>

<comment>Single mothers have much more difficulty raising their children. Greater numbers of these children have resorted to risky behaviors. Misogyny? How about misandry which assumes men have no value in their families at all?It is possible that single mothers in Europe have more money because the welfare state functions as the "baby daddy". True fathers are often considered irrelevant. This has led to the problems Europe has now since the welfare state can't go on forever. They have imported groups of people who do not value their civilizations. They appear to not value American ideas of free speech so they don't protest. Mona Sahlin wants to enforce change upon the Swedish people often without their consent.</comment>

<comment>Could you link to your source? I'm having a hard time wrapping my brain around what a "true father" is versus just a "father" and how anyone would know that, in Europe, they are "often considered irrelevant."</comment>

<comment>Scandinavia values men very little. There is a movement in Sweden to ban urinals; to ban gender pronouns, etc. I don't know how that goes over with the incoming Muslim immigrants who are supposed to change Sweden forever according to Mona Sahlin.</comment>

<comment>wow-talk about pulling something out of your asss!</comment>

<comment>Sorry; tis true whether you choose to believe it or not. Sweden also has the third largest rate of rapes in the world. This comes mostly from recent immigrants; who consider infidel women fair game.</comment>

<comment>ive been all over Europe and Scandinavian countries do not view men like that.</comment>

<comment>Then why the push to ban urinals?</comment>

<comment>The seven deadly sins: pride, greed, lust, envy, gluttony, wrath and slothHomosexuality isn't one of them.</comment>

<comment>I think it would fall within lust somehow. Just sayin.  History channel hasn't put together an episode on it yet soooo.</comment>

<comment>"I think it would fall within lust somehow."No more than any other type of relationship. So they should be going after anybody who's living together and not married with the same intensity.</comment>

<comment>I am just stating what a thumper would likely say.  I see the 7 as a mini guide to living as right as one can.  Walk the fence between them and be well.  Try not to indulge.</comment>

<comment>the seven deadly sins aren't in the bible so...</comment>

<comment>Very true and like I said, just speaking from the point of view of a thumper.  The 7 sins are as valid as it gets when it comes to living a good life . IMO.  And I am no thumper.</comment>

<comment>"pride, greed, lust, envy, . . . ."Are those sins, or chapters in 'The Art of the Deal'?</comment>

<comment>Trump's campaign mission statement.</comment>

<comment>A Good Christian™ would say homosexuality is covered under "lust". Somehow. I can't explain it, but they'd say it.</comment>

<comment>Most of the Left seems to practice the first one.</comment>

<comment>What a prideful statement.</comment>

<comment>We are all prideful. It is the first sin in Genesis; the one that caused the downfall of mankind. We are all susceptible to its lure; conservatives just admit it. Leftists don't seem to admit it even exists.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure any parent knows that if you tell your kid "don't touch this" without ever giving them a good reason, that they're going to touch it.So it seems that what "caused the downfall of mankind" was either God's lack of understanding human psychology or God's plan (he knew what would happen and set it up to happen that way for a reason).  In either case, I wouldn't say "pride" was the cause.  Adam and Eve were no more "prideful" then a two year old that touches a hot stove.</comment>

<comment>True. When people who claim gays are sinners get equally worked up about banning divorce and shellfish, it will be easier to imagine they are truly just following the word of the Bible, rather than following their bigoted impulses.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget getting equally worked up about anyone wearing a poly-cotton blend.</comment>

<comment>Those Bastards!</comment>

<comment>Poly-cotton blends are an abomination, and in more than just the Biblical sense!</comment>

<comment>But they are comfy, especially in warm weather.</comment>

<comment>You can be comfy in HELL!</comment>

<comment>Who would those be? Do you even understand the reasons for the restrictions in Leviticus? No one wants to ban shellfish by the way. Not even the Orthodox Jews. They can quietly practice their faith without forcing it on others. That is a concept that perhaps you don't understand?</comment>

<comment>yes, we get it-we just dismiss it as nonsense. To believe that the god in the OT is the same god as the NT is idiocy. No god would order a woman to marry her rapist then change its mind because of human cultural norms later in the NT-that's the height of retardation. They are different gods,. The OT god is based on greek gods where the god exhibits human emotion (rage, anger, jealousy, etc)- the NT god was changed to be nicer to gather the masses-a friendlier god if you will.</comment>

<comment>They are not based on Greek gods since Greek gods have physical limitations, cavort, sin, etc. The God of the Jews has no form. The anger; jealousy described are metaphors.</comment>

<comment>nope-im a study of religions, ma'am. The OT god is emotionally based on human gods like Roman and Greek. The OT god exhibits human emotions-have you read the OT? Have you ever studied any religion outside of Christianity or Judaism? Theyre not metaphors-god strikes down because he is a vengeful, wrathful god-the first commandment is all about his jealousy!!!</comment>

<comment>Of course it is; this is a metaphor presenting God's disapproval.</comment>

<comment>I said no</comment>

<comment>Well yes, we all know you are a world respected Christian theologian.</comment>

<comment>I clearly know more than you-I know the backwards and forwards of Christianity, ma'am-all atheists do-its how we become free form religious nonsense!!</comment>

<comment>Most atheists who are argumentative know very little. They stopped learning about religion by any objective measure. Sorry; if your answer is to scream Bigot! at every argument; there is not any logic being accessed.</comment>

<comment>I'd be a lot more persuaded by "[t]hey can quietly practice their faith without forcing it on others" if I hadn't been forced to wait nearly a decade to marry my husband because of various religious folk forcing their religion on me.</comment>

<comment>For that matter, if these religious nutjobs are so keen on enforcing crazy and arcane Old Testament laws, shouldn't they also come down hard on anyone who eats fat (Leviticus 3:17) or crawfish (Deuteronomy 14:9-10), for instance?</comment>

<comment>Do you usually speak about subjects you don't understand? The laws in the Torah are for the Jews only; not the Christians. Who have you ever seen trying to enforce such laws?</comment>

<comment>Sophie, that's stupid as we said. You really think your god wanted you to marry your rapist at one time?</comment>

<comment>I am speaking to the fact that there are no Christians forcing people to accept Old Testament laws. Is that what you meant? Christians have never followed the Torah.</comment>

<comment>not true-the NT is very clear that many of the old laws are followed by Christians (surely you've heard of the ten commandments??)</comment>

<comment>If you read my earlier comments; you would see that I distinguish between the Torah which is meant for the Jews only, since it has specific punishments; & the Ten Commandments; which have no attached punishments; thus they are considered universal.</comment>

<comment>Even if that's true, the Old Testament still contains issues that apply to nonbelievers. For starters, there's that whole thing about killing them straight from Deuteronomy and Numbers:http://www.patheos.com/blogs/d...As for who's trying to enforce these laws? Fundamentalist Christians, who, according to your formulation, are NOT the intended recipients of the Torah's strictures. Why else would they push for the implementation of Biblical laws onto the secular constitutions of the land? From people like Kim Davis, to Roy Moore, to Mike Huckabee, and George W. Bush, they seem to have no problem about forcing everyone else to conform to their views.</comment>

<comment>What are you even talking about? Kim Davis,  Mike Huckabee, et al; were forcing  no one to follow the Torah.  George Bush? Where does he even fall in here? He rarely tried to influence laws this way. He was not even a fundamentalist which is something which Christopher Hitchens noticed.  Do you even understand the Torah?</comment>

<comment>Well, anti-homosexuality laws are found in Deuteronomy and Leviticus, for instance. Kim Davis, Mike Huckabee, Roy Moore, and George Bush were all on the record in trying to get laws passed at either the local, state, or federal level that mirrored these prohibitions. And I brought up the example of the dietary prohibitions above to illustrate a point: why are these religious nutjobs so selective in their reading and interpretations of Biblical laws? In order words, why JUST homosexuality here?And come to think of it, Huckabee goes much further than others on the religious right:http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/M...</comment>

<comment>No one wants dietary laws passed because no Christian follows them. When was the last time you encountered a Christian who kept a kosher kitchen? The Torah is to be followed by Jews; not Christians. Christians are not selective; mainline Christianity does not follow these laws at all. They may study them as part of background on Jewish history; or on what God deemed important to keep His people separate; but they are not followed. The exception is the Ten Commandments. They have no set punishments unlike much of the rest of the Torah so they are considered universal.I sincerely doubt George Bush was actively pushing to pass any Old Testament laws at the local level. He was usually pretty laid back about such stuff. He doesn't usually defend himself against false accusations either. He just sort of quietly disappears.</comment>

<comment>Again, you're kind of missing my main point. I'm pointing out the double standards and selective enforcement of Old Testament laws by the religious right. Why is it that they discard nearly all of the Old Testament's strictures EXCEPT the ones pertaining to homosexuality. For that matter, why else would they be willing to force the rest of the population to conform to their views one way or another?And for the record, George W Bush might've been laid back and neutral, but he did still try to pass a bill through Congress that still defined marriage as between a man and a woman. So my argument still stands:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>That is hardly a complicated law based on Leviticus. It was accepted as common practice by such luminaries as Barak Obama & Hillary Clinton.</comment>

<comment>that's a lie-they simply fibbed until the mindless masses caught up-you don't honestly think they suddenly switched positions??</comment>

<comment>O.K. they fibbed. No one has ever accused them of being too honest. However, this was standards thought until recently; it had little connection but, like most cultures, was based on common practices.</comment>

<comment>like slavery-then we learned better</comment>

<comment>With Hillary, you can never really be sure. With people like Obama, however, they only pretended to support "traditional" marriage in order to get elected; they probably always planned on supporting gay marriages and needed just enough support from some of the more moderate and fanatical voters first in order to implement them. Either way, all the references to "traditional" and "time-honored" marriages and whatnot would surely hint at such notions being based on Leviticus and Deuteronomy.</comment>

<comment>Why? Other cultures will have not heard of Leviticus or Deuteronomy have also based traditional marriages; many of them plural, upon traditional relationships between males & females. American Indians did this too in spite of the presence of the two Spirit person which did not really represent traditional marriage.</comment>

<comment>Here's a Christian pastor preaching the OT death penalty for gays:  http://www.usatoday.com/story/...And another Christian church preaching Leviticus: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Google provides quite a list of them.</comment>

<comment>These are not mainline Christian churches. You can find any amount of these tiny cults somewhere but they are condemned & classified as cults by most mainline churches,</comment>

<comment>You asked: "Who have you ever seen trying to enforce such laws?"I provided examples. Your response is just a variance on the "No True Scotsman" fallacy.Regardless, the New Testament is nearly as bloody as the Old. Romans, in discussing sinners in general, including homosexuals, says this: " Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them."It looks like the NT and OT are in agreement here.</comment>

<comment>You have not provided good examples of mainline Christianity. Anyone can pick some wacky cult; they exist in small numbers in a great many places but are not representative of the kind of Christianity we are discussing.The New Testament is not violent at all. It does not prescribe the death penalty for homosexuality or anything else.  The New Testament repeatedly stresses the sinfulness of human nature. Therefore all sinners are deserving of death in the spiritual sense but Christ, through His act of love has suffered death for us so that all who believe on Him need not suffer it.</comment>

<comment>Again, this is the "No True Scotsman" fallacy. You cannot wave away actual Christian belief as a "wacky cult." I quoted the actual Bible there and not some specific point of faith for a single "wacky cult." I went right to the source.Romans and Leviticus call for the death of homosexuals in plain English.</comment>

<comment>No, I am not as familiar with Leviticus since Christians are not obligated to follow it. You would have to ask a rabbi about the particulars.  As far as Romans goes; it sets up the state of sinfulness. In many places in the New Testament; Christians are warned of their sinfulness. Their sinful nature is deserving of death; but Christ's death on the Cross has paid the price for that.</comment>

<comment>Well, apparently it was just a down payment since Christians feel the need to keep exacting a toll whenever they meet a homosexual.Nevertheless, Romans doesn't say "...but Christ's death on the Cross has paid the price for that." Romans says "they deserve death." So this additional "but" is just interpretation that gives Christians the wiggle room to avoid prison on murder charges. Other Christians could interpret the Bible differently and come up with no "but" and others still could say the "but" applies to not killing as well as treating homosexuals as loving humans deserving of respect.The real question is why do anti-gay Christians forgive people living in adultery and having children in adultery and welcome them into their churches and bake wedding cakes for them but bristle at the idea of doing the same for homosexuals? Adultery is in God's top ten list of bad things to do and homosexuality is not but the former gets a pass? Why is that? Why do Christians expect homosexuals to repent and never sin again but accept adulterers who are still adulterating regularly?  (I think the answer is that heterosexual adulterers are heterosexual--sin having little to actually do with it.)</comment>

<comment>The entire New Testament is concerned with man's sinful nature. Read C.S. Lewis' book; "Mere Christianity". One sin is equal to another. The greatest sin in Christianity is pride. Pride is the first sin mentioned in Genesis; it is dangerous because one looks away from God when one practices it. When a person  has too much pride; he is looking down on others. He then cannot be focused on God. C.S. Lewis has said that the most prideful people sitting in church proud of their righteousness are often more sinful than a prostitute on the street whom they may be looking down upon.Committing a homosexual act as opposed to being a homosexual is just one of a panapoly of sins.people can commit. It is no greater or less than adultery unless it is followed by pride. No Christian church that I know of has ever excused adultery. Some Christians, of course, may be committing it privately without the church knowing. Everyone is expected to repent of their sins & sin no more; although of course, they may "backslide". If they do, there is still forgiveness available for them.It is not the Christians' job to forgive anyone who has not wronged him personally. That is God's perogative alone.</comment>

<comment>Adultery, as laid out in the bible, means you are married once until death do you part. If you divorce and remarry while your former spouse lives, you're an adulterer. Kim Davis, living with husband #2, is an adulterer. She cannot be forgiven unless she repents of that sin and as long as she lives with this other man, she's not repenting. It's very much the same for a homosexual couple, right? As long as they are living together "in sin," they are not repenting of that sin.So, why do churches celebrate adulterous heterosexual marriages but reject homosexual ones? (Because if they tossed all of the adulterers they'd lose half the church? Good thing they are able to reinterpret scripture to fit their human needs.)</comment>

<comment>In the first place forgiveness is up to God. Neither you nor I nor anyone else has anything to do with it. We can only choose to forgive those who have wronged us.Different denominations have different views of this. The Catholic church looks upon divorce so harshly because marriage is a sacrament in the Catholic church which it is not in many other denominations. Even Catholics, to my understanding; can receive annulments from the Church which would permit remarriage.None of that applies to Kim Davis however. She  was not a Christian during her first marriages; she has only been so for a few years. In fact, at one point I believe the Catholic church did not recognize the marriages of other denominations so of course it accepted divorced persons of those religions since they had never married in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Mathew 19, quoting Jesus directly: "  I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”Kim Davis was Christian and married in a church for her first wedding, based on articles that have been published.  "Kimberly Jean Bailey's first marriage was to Dwain Allen Wallace on August 5, 1984 when she was 18. The ceremony took place in Morehead, Kentucky, and was conducted by Minister Owen Cox of the United Baptist Church.""Kim Davis then married Joe Davis, a delivery driver, on August 24, 1996, in Morehead by Baptist church minister H.G. Pratt.""Just over a year later, Kim Davis and the biological father of her twins, Thomas Dale McIntyre Jr., married in a ceremony on November 11, 2007, at Skye Bridge in Wolfe County.The minister who conducted the ceremony was a member of the Universal Life Church – which will ordain anyone over the age of 18 with an online certificate, meaning that the marriage was outside the church.""Less than a year later, Kim Davis, 49, then married Joe Davis for the second time on August 24, 2009 - the same date they had been married 13 years earlier.The ceremony was performed by Judge Jim Nickel of Rowan County in Morehead. She remains married to Joe Davis."By my count, marriage #1 and #2 were both in the church. #3 and #4 are not.She converted to her current version of Christianity later, but was raised Christian and married in the faith.</comment>

<comment>If you belong to many evangelical churches you are not considered Christian unless you are born again. They often preach that just joining a church will not get you into heaven. So according to them; she, in her first marriages, was not a Christian even if she was a member of a church. Christianity teaches often about the invisible church of believers which is spiritual; it does not always depend upon physical membership.Different denomination have different definitions assigned to that Bible verse.</comment>

<comment>Well, if Christian churches can excuse people from Jesus' own "anyone" then I suppose anything is possible. Which brings us back to how Christian bakers cannot assign "different definitions" to the prohibition on helping Christian gay couples marry or, using your own example, baking cakes for non-Christian homosexual couples since, apparently, they're only sinning if they're Christian.There still appears to be a double standard for Christians in how they treat adulterers versus homosexuals. Since Kim Davis wasn't a [fill in Christian denomination here] Christian, those marriages don't count against her and she isn't an adulterer. But homosexuals, regardless of their religious faith, are held to a different standard. They're sinners no matter what.(As I was raised Catholic, I believe sin is sin, regardless of what religion you adhere to. When Jesus said "anyone" he must have meant anyone and not just Catholics.)</comment>

<comment>In Mathew, Jesus orders children who curse their parents put to death-thats pretty violent...</comment>

<comment>Stop lying.</comment>

<comment>I don't often speak about subjects I don't understand, but when I do, it's because of spite.Namely, if you don't want to hear me (and others) quote Leviticus so much, then you should probably talk to the Christians who keep quoting Leviticus at us.  But until Christians stop quoting Leviticus at us, your "the laws in the Torah are for the Jews only" line doesn't really fly.</comment>

<comment>Because it's pure homophobic hate that has nothing to do with religion. But I'm just answering a rhetorical here.</comment>
