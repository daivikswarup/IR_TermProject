<comment>Is this about Hillary?</comment>

<comment>So, you are really unable to read.</comment>

<comment>I enjoyed your commentary and I agreed with it; but not one word about the ACLU lawsuit in Louisiana? Concerning, chiefly, the the lack of resources in LA's public defenders office. A nationwide problem, PD's are often funded by the very people they defend, by means of fee, fines etc. </comment>

<comment>Worthy point, but outside the scope of this article.</comment>

<comment>Glad to see this. The overwhelming majority of defendants in the federal criminal justice system are represented by awful hacks (lack of funding) or former prosecutors who grease the skids for awful plea bargains. </comment>

<comment>I disagree. Speaking from experience, I found that there is a big difference between federal public defenders, who are generally excellent, and state public defenders, who can sometimes be absolutely awful.Don't misunderstand. Some state public defenders are great lawyers notwithstanding crushing caseloads that far exceed ABA standards and poverty wages. The good ones are few and far between and tend to move on after they burn out.Federal cases are tough to beat because the feds have virtually unlimited resources and time to put cases together. Because of minimum mandatory sentences, they can flip lesser involved defendants in conspiracy cases, which makes it virtually impossible for the major defendants to win.In the Bundy case, the defendants cooked their own goose (geese) by videotaping everything they did. Reading between the proverbial lines (since I'm not involved in the case and have not communicated with the lawyers), the lawyer representing Aamon Bundy did the only thing he could to minimize his client's exposure. He apparently persuaded him to withdraw from the conspiracy by urging those who remained at the wildlife refuge to give up and go home. By opting out, Bundy cannot be held legally responsible for any crimes that the remaining conspirators commit in furtherance of the conspiracy. Depending on what happens at the Refuge, that could include assaulting, wounding or even killing a federal officer.Even the best criminal lawyer cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear and this case is indefensible. Despite what the clients passionately believe, they do not have a cognizable legal defense. Persuading an ideologue like Aamon Bundy to cut and run is an impressive accomplishment.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but after telling the pop tarts to leave (selling out his supposed values) did not get him released, the idiot went back to urging them to remain.  The annotations in his magic pocket constitution did not cover this situation even though the magic underwear covers his privates.</comment>

<comment>While Aamon Bundy may have cut his losses, I doubt that he will be running anywhere.But for one who set out to occupy a federal facility, he will have that opportunity.  Even if it is a facility that doesn't permit runs for beer and jerky.</comment>

<comment>Now it is all about damage control •</comment>

<comment>Are you aware that Cliven Bundy is arriving in Burns and Portland this Thursday?  He has said he has taken "control" of the situation.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for this very helpful elaboration from someone who knows these systems from the inside out.</comment>

<comment>But Bundy withdrew his plea for those remain four to leave.  Instead he told them to stay and the FBI to leave.  It was law enforcement strategy initially that got these militia extremists to leave the refuge so they could be arrested without endangering innocents. These attorney's have not persuaded the Bundy extremist militia to do anything except their offer of 'free' pro bono legal services which later the attorney's shifted to a crowd funding legal service to benefit the attorneys.</comment>

<comment>Most state defendants can only wish they could have the kind of representation a federal defendant gets.  The federal defense bar, whether the federal defender program, CJA appointments, or paid lawyers, is quite good.  Probably the best defense counsel you could hope for is a former federal prosecutor.</comment>

<comment>HaHa, since I came up to the big leagues (federal court)  via the state defender, I can't agree with your statement that former federal prosecutors make the best criminal defense lawyers. I'll admit that many times they do, but even the best struggle at times to build a relationship of trust with many of their street-wise clients. I didn't have that problem.</comment>

<comment>A former federal prosecutor is worse than no representation at all in many instances.  They know the case is going to end in a conviction (significantly more than 90% do due to Man. Mins., conspiracy charges which impact the rules of evidence, and the piling on of charges which make nearly every offense punishable by 25 or more years) so they lead ignorant and usually broke defendants down the path of least resistance. For most cases there is a cozy relationship between both sides of the bar and the judge.  They want to keep the wheels of justice turning because they feel as though they are overworked and just want to process cases.</comment>

<comment>I read ATLaura’s comment as opining that the best defense counsel in a FEDERAL prosecution , was a former federal prosecutor .</comment>

<comment>Theoretically, they should be.  AFter all, they know the system extremely well.  It is contrary to human nature, and my experience, to think that after years of working as the point of the spear in an outrageously unfair system that former prosecutors will be zealous advocates for defendants once they switch to a, usually, lower paying and higher stress job as a defense lawyer.</comment>

<comment>Re former federal prosecutor CORRECT ‼ He or she understands the pros/cons of both sides of the table •</comment>

<comment>When my husband was studying for the bar, I helped him with his Barbri quiz questions.  It was then it dawned on me that the law is basically a script for the longest running soap opera in history- two people had a disagreement, the disagreement was resolved and their story becomes precedent for how to handle the next disagreement.</comment>

<comment>Sorry little flower but I think you missed a few of those law school classes.  Hope your husband managed to pass the bar, with your help of course.</comment>

<comment>Some people, however, don’t believe in negotiation, or indeed in what most of us call law. Living in Oregon, I also met many local “militiamen,” attended their meetings, and even visited one in jail. Their program for federal land is dangerous—the end of federal stewardship, or even a radical cutback, would be catastrophic for Western lands. Their constitutional theory, too, is toxic. It has evolved out of the semi-literate, overtly racist theories of Mormon extremist W. Cleon Skousen. In essence, it proclaims the sovereign prerogative of white Christian men to take what they want and justify it in the name of an imaginary “organic Constitution” untainted by equality for women, nonwhites, immigrants, or religious minorities. I despise everything the Malheur occupiers claim to stand for.Did your wikipedia edits get deleted for original research? It's funny how they opened up to you about all this racist sexist stuff but not to anyone else. Or do you just claim to be able to see into their hearts and know it?</comment>

<comment>Don't swallow everything the FEDS say..they are not on the up and up either.  Be careful what you believe where they are concerned.</comment>

<comment>What a wonderful article narrating what the Justice system was set up to be, and where it has failed up. And bravo to the Atlantic for publishing an article supporting our system. So much of the news over Ferguson, Eric Gartner, Trayvon Martin and others has been reported in a way to (a) make these stories exceptionally sensational, and (b) make people believe that they know better than the case jurors do... all of which serves to undermine the Judicial process and bring us closer to a Judical system where its "conviction by the media"</comment>

<comment>I think you should re-read the article. It is pretty clear about the significant failures of our incarceration crazy justice system, and (although from a different perspective) the role of racism in society. It doesn't mention or make any claim about Ferguson, Eric Garner, or Trayvon Martin. It simply argues, eloquently, for the right of everyone to have an equipped defense and fair trial. The fact that you could read what you read into it with not only no evidence but no mention of those crimes, shows you may be carrying around some biases and assumptions of your own.</comment>

<comment>What I read into it is what I believe the author intended: That our judicial process, at least when applied as it was intended when created, is a very fair system; the problem is with our laws. The writer praised his two former students for defending very unpopular defendants, explains how most non-lawyers don't see the value in vigorously defending the prima-facia guiltiest, and how important this is too Justice. Also, he defends the ninth circuit for applying the law as written, pointing out correctly that this is not a problem with the Judicial process, but with the law.The cases that I cited were all cases where the news lead many people to believe that the cop / vigilante involved was beyond question guilty, when the actual facts of the case turned out otherwise. You asked me if I had biases that influenced my comments - absolutely! The bias I will readily admit to is that in my opinion US news does a much better job rabble-rousing and seeing TV adds and newspapers than it does in being fair, balanced, and reporting the actual facts. I am frightened for our society that the news can cast its finger at just about anyone these days and  make it seem like they are obviously a criminal, before the facts or due process has taken place. Finally, I also agree to his points about our laws being wrong and the necessity of reforming parts of the law like mandatory minimums AND laws that are racially biased. And I think this is the difference we have - I think you see this as the major point, whereas I see the defense of the Judicial process as the major point.  Cheers!</comment>

<comment>Did you taught them this?http://www.opb.org/news/series...or this?https://www.scribd.com/doc/298...</comment>

<comment>Spoken from the heart. As a former death penalty lawyer and law professor, I know of which you speak. The criminal defense lawyer is liberty's last champion. We force the prosecution to prove its case and by so doing we keep it honest. That is a sacred duty.You taught your students well.</comment>

<comment>I thought you mainly negotiated plea deals to keep your clients out of trial and close as fast as possible?</comment>

<comment>Each case stands on its own facts, but a plea agreement which avoids a death sentence is often a good result for the accused under extreme circumstances.</comment>

<comment>He certainly did. Unfortunately - as you undoubtedly know - our elected officials have mounted a sustained, extremely effective campaign to tie the hands not only of defense attorneys but judges - a conspiracy (no, I don't think that's too strong a word) by two of the branches of our government to emasculate the third. All the more reason to be grateful to those attorneys who stubbornly keep looking for opportunities to "force the prosecution to prove its case and by so doing... keep it honest."</comment>

<comment>Johnnie Cochran-types are still the symbol of racist, soulless, liberal lawyers.</comment>

<comment>You said, " racist, soulless, liberal lawyers."You do not know what you are talking about. Lawyers like people, come in all shapes and sizes. Some former conservative prosecutors who went on to become criminal defense lawyers are great lawyers.Some of the most 'liberal' Supreme Court justices were conservatives appointed by Republican presidents.Paleo conservatives are more likely to believe the Constitution means what it says, especially the Bill of Rights.</comment>

<comment>Freeing the guilty so they continue to prey on the innocent is not a "right".</comment>

<comment>If the goal is to truly deliver justice, why are so many cases plea-bargained?  I don't know the stats, but I'd hypothesize that's why so many black and brown men end up in jail unjustly.The system needs an overhaul from policing all the way to sentencing.</comment>

<comment>Money.. If you can Afford Justice, you get Justice. If you cant, you take what you can get. Ill tell you something else, to take away a person's ability to support his family over a misdemeanor charge IS NOT Justice and that's just what you do when you take away a person's ability to drive, thus ruining that persons life- over a misdemeanor? Really?I can understand it if the person's actions caused the death, or even the injury of another human being but over misdemeanor charges not related to driving? Be Serious.</comment>

<comment>Then you actually expect him to pay those Hefty Fines after you have taken away his ability to work? Amazing.</comment>

<comment>The goal is not to deliver justice. It's to maintain the status quo.</comment>

<comment>As I understand it, these two lawyers went unasked to the refuge prior to the arrests. This may be in violation of Oregon law prohibiting lawyers from soliciting clients, I.e., ambulance chasing.It will be interesting to see how this plays out.</comment>

<comment>Something went wrong, they "ambulance chased" the Bundys. One possibility was the money. Let's just hope they didn't advise the Bundys on what laws not to break and how to get away with the ones they did. In any case the Oregon Bar has to investigate for any misconduct.</comment>

<comment>You must not have heard the recent discussion about possible ethics violations on the part of the two lawyers who you so admire.http://www.opb.org/news/series...</comment>

<comment>I agree that everyone should have the right to counsel.But the Oregon public broadcasting news report raised ethical issues about these attorneys reaching out to these men early during the occupation.My understanding is the report raised two questions:* Did the firm "ambulance chase" this group in the hope of gaining publicity for the law firm? * The second question raised was did the attorneys coach the leaders of the takeover on what criminal actions they should avoid or assign to more recent members?The article does not draw any conclusions but it is a fascinating read. I would encourage all to read it in its entirety.If you put the words " oregon bundy law firm ethics" in a search engine, it will bring up the article on the Oregon Public Broadcasting webpage.Some excerpts from this article are:"Another question hanging over the case is whether attorneys advised militant leaders to pin certain crimes on younger militants and new recruits.Before he was arrested, Ryan Bundy said attorneys gave him and other occupation leader’s lists of laws to steer clear of breaking.Ammon Bundy also said that attorneys had inventoried potential legal violations, and had given the militant leaders a list of laws they believed were being broken.An OPB reporter saw militant leader Ryan Payne, who headed the security team at the refuge before he was arrested, giving orders to young militants. Some of them had arrived at the refuge hours before and were new to the group.Payne was also seen stopping now deceased militant Robert “LaVoy” Finicum from getting into a white, federally owned truck.“You don’t do that, have them do that,” Payne said as he pointed a new arrival who went by the name of “Joe.”Ammon Bundy told television journalists that he would not drive federally owned vehicles, use federal computers, or engage in other illegal activities that other, rank-and-file, militants had done.When Ryan Bundy was asked about his brother’s comments, Ryan Bundy acknowledged militant leaders would not engage in those visible crimes, because younger militants and newer recruits were less likely to be prosecuted.“The government’s going to leave those guys alone,” Ryan Bundy said.Two of the last holdouts on the refuge — David Fry and Sandy Anderson — confirmed to OPB that they, too, saw militant leaders order those outside the inner circle to break laws, like using government computers, driving federal vehicles, or plowing new roads on the refuge.A source close to Ammon Bundy, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the ongoing federal criminal case, said a list of crimes to avoid might have been compiled. However, the person suggested that interloping lawyers from out of state had created and distributed that inventory to militant leaders.Law professor John Strait said that if a lawyer advised the Bundys on “how to break the law,” that would be an ethical violation.“If the lawyer counsels what is or isn’t against the law, that’s their job,” Strait said. “But the lawyer can’t help by saying, ‘Here’s how you commit the crimes smarter.’”</comment>

<comment>Lawyers have a moral duty to chase ambulances. The profession has an obligation to help the poor, the outcast, and the accused; even when the accused is patently guilty. Compare the Kennedy assassination and the Oklahoma City bombing. Oswald never got a trial so many people still believe in the many conspiracy theories on the case. McVeigh and Nichols stood trial, the evidence was examined and any faults in it were made public. Both were proven guilty beyond any doubt, reasonable or otherwise. The American legal system is not flawless, but it is the best way we have of getting closer to true Justice.</comment>

<comment>"C. MICHAEL ARNOLDOSB #011873EugeneReprimandOn Jan. 17, 2008, the disciplinary board approved a stipulation for discipline reprimanding Eugene lawyer C. Michael Arnold for violating RPC 8.4(a)(2) (commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyer’s honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects).Arnold was the prosecutor for the City of Florence at a hearing in which a minor pled guilty to driving under the influence of intoxicants and entered into a diversion agreement. Arnold subsequently contacted the minor, ostensibly for the purpose of checking up on her, and suggested that they meet. Arnold drove the minor to a restaurant and purchased two glasses of wine for her in violation of ORS 471.410(2), which prohibits anyone, other than a parent or guardian, from selling, giving or otherwise making available any alcoholic liquor to a person under the age of 21."</comment>

<comment>It seems the author is biased by the factthat he taught the lawyers representing Bundy and Cox. I would take issue withthe quality of these lawyers: does visitingthe Refuge (which continues to be 'occupied') while the illegal 'standoff' was in full swing, having lunch with Ammon Bundy, soliciting him for legal representation, and advising him which laws to avoid breaking (telling him to havelower level occupiers break these laws instead) count as being a 'good lawyer'??While I agree that every accused criminalneeds good legal representation, the twolawyers you are praising have been shameless in their promotion of Bundy(and Cox's) violent and delusional agendaof overthrow of the Federal Governmentand the rule of law. </comment>

<comment>I agree with the author that even the worst terrorists deserve representation, but he missed the part where Mike Arnold was convicted of buying alcohol for a minor female and was then reprimanded by the bar:https://www.osbar.org/publicat...(Scroll down)</comment>

<comment>These two lawyers, Michael Arnold and Lissa Casey, went to the Malheur Refuge and told the militant leaders what not to do to break the law.  They told the Bundys and other leaders to let their minions do the dirty work of stealing government cars and using government equipment, thereby keeping the leaders' hands 'clean'.  That, my good professor, is an ethical if not legal violation of the Oregon state bar and Oregon Supreme Court rules of conduct.  They also went out there not as pro bono, but as ambulance chasers, trying to get a client instead of the other way around.  That, too,is an ethical violation.  They should be disbarred.  And you, sir, should think twice about praising such unethical behavior.</comment>

<comment>How much longer can the progressive left take and lay dormant vast amount of resources while our human population keeps growing????  Holding the supply line hostage while millions end up in poverty without shelter, food or the minerals required because prices have skyrocketed due to a BIG FAT plug in the supply line cause by the embiciles who think they're protecting a birds flight path..</comment>

<comment>you should read up a little before you post. that refuge was created by Teddy Roosevelt - a republican.</comment>

<comment>And it was a progressive movement - Doesn't matter which party plays the communist - I'm not bias.  Its still BS.</comment>

<comment>Imbecile.  If you're going to call people stupid, perhaps you should use spell check when posting.Also, as an economic super power whose output largely revolves around a quaternary economy, our population growth has slowed immeasurably.And yet even more facts to bruise your oft repeated right wing talking point gibberish, gas is almost a dollar a gallon. So what supply line is being held up in the new 100 year American shale rush?</comment>

<comment>Land, shelter and minerals.  The main point is by the U.S. Constitution these should be managed by the state not the U.S.</comment>

<comment>So you're accusing the Liberal Left Wing of the United States of harboring land, shelter, and minerals unconstitutionally?You're wrong.  *Pats lovingly* Educate yourself.</comment>

<comment>Correct; as is highly debated by top holding officials and frankly is well stated in the U.S. Constitution for anyone NOT trying to corrupt or side-step it.Legislature that has passedhttp://www.azleg.gov/Documents...http://www.azleg.gov/Documents...http://le.utah.gov/~2015/bills...http://le.utah.gov/~2015/bills...http://legisweb.state.wy.us/20...http://blog.tenthamendmentcent...http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bill...http://www.capitol.tn.gov/Bill...http://wapp.capitol.tn.gov/app...</comment>

<comment>Yep that's right; The Supreme Court reads it wrong all the time and on purpose to play an activist role.  The Patriots who actually love this country the way it should be is insisting the judges act honorably.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes. Everything the Supreme Court does is apart of a vast Left Wing Conspiracy.  And YOU'RE a patriot. L O L.Off your meds. You should get back on them, become one of those productive members of society rather than a gun violence statistic waiting to happen.</comment>

<comment>Off into personal insult land you go.  Guess the grown-up conversation is over.</comment>

<comment>Insult? That's a fact son, heed the advice given to you.</comment>

<comment>Basically the lawyers went in and by explaining the laws to the occupiers, intervened in an ongoing criminal affair, thereby making themselves accessories to the criminal affair ongoing.</comment>

<comment>The student of whom you are so proud, Mike Arnold of the Arnold Law Firm, and his colleague Lissa Casey have violated Oregon bar rule section 7.3 which prohibits attorneys from soliciting clients.If this "ambulance chaser" is your student, that speaks poorly of your instruction and example.</comment>

<comment>Why do they even call it the justice system ?All day long they prosecute people for victim-less "crimes".Did those Big Pharma pills get you addicted after that sports injury ?  We are charging you with possession , coercing a plea bargain then trashing your life with that "drug offender" record , trashing your finances with fines and fees, taking your driver license, sending you to probation to be used as a cash cow till you are so miserable and depressed you kill yourself or use drugs for relief and pee dirty and you goto jail."Justice system" its more like a crime against humanity.</comment>

<comment>Many of us who have been through laws school know better than to call it a justice system.  It is not a justice system.  It is a legal system, nothing more nothing less.  We can hope the law are just, but as long as those writing the law are bought and sold by the wealthy, there will be little justice in the laws.</comment>

<comment>Dad was a corporate lawyer--skilled, in demand. He also drank too much, cheated on Mom, made me a bushel of unfulfilled promises, and shuffled off the coil when I was 9, leaving me with a good decade's worth of WTFs.But never mind that: one night at the bar, years before, he met a guy not long off the boat from Poland. The guy and his brother owned a pick-up truck, were trying to earn a living, but were getting screwed by assorted clients taking advantage of their poor English, lack of connections, and unfamiliarity with a new culture. They couldn't afford a lawyer--this was back before free legal services were standard in many jurisdictions.Dad didn't like what he heard. He bought the guy a drink and told him he'd represent him. For free. Suddenly this poor immigrant and his brother had one of the region's top corporate attorneys on their side.Several years later when Dad died the two brothers owned an interstate trucking company with several hundred employees, hundreds of semis, and terminals in five states. For years after Dad's death the owners helped our family considerably; my very first job was as an OS&D (over, short, and damaged) clerk at their terminal outside Pittsburgh. They didn't really need another OS&D clerk but the boss decided I would make a good assistant.I related this story recently here in Quito when some of my Ecuadorian wife's extended family members asked me why I take such pleasure in feeding them and their (poor) friends. I tell them that there were plenty of less-savory things about Dad I could dwell on, but I prefer to put into practice that aspect I find most inspirational. The positive behavior of others, taken root in our hearts, is like a weed. You can try to poison it with cynicism or craven self-interest but it refuses to die.Nobody talks much about the good that lawyers can and often do. It should be stated.</comment>

<comment>Interesting article. I have a lot of respect for attorneys, having been on a jury a few times, you see how law actually operates for the benefit of society.</comment>

<comment>I find the premise of this article a bit odd.  Is defending a “bad” client really more noble then defending a “good” one?  And don’t “good” clients need “conscientious” lawyers just as much as “bad” ones?  Being a conscientious lawyer is not measured by the types of clients you represent.  It is measured by how well you represent them.</comment>

<comment>The Arnold Law firm is facing serious ethical questions for soliciting the Bundy's business.  Claiming they were only soliciting for pro bono work is not gonna fly!I heard Mike talking with the pop tart 4 (remaining occupiers), don't know if Mike knew at the time they were live streaming him.  Talk about pandering.  Did not make him look good, at least not to any one with a brain, but  hey, he was trying to appeal to the brainless.It's all about the money, not representing the downtrodden.  If someone wants to do that, they can give me a call, I have plenty of clients that are truly under-represented and they don't have go-fund-me websites, or drive expensive pickup trucks, or make stories in the Atlantic, in fact many don't even have interweb access, they ride the bus, they can't afford Stetson leather rancher hats, they don't have thousands of dollars worth of gun, long, semi-automatic or otherwise, and they don't have time to drive over to Harney county.  Lets get real.  the Bundy's are not poor, the are wealth welfare queens, living off the largess of the federal government.  And, most important, they are white.A $100,000 defense fund for a private law firm?  The homeless woman on the corner of Broadway and Willamette being hassled by the Eugene cops is luck if she gets 10 minutes with an over worked public defender who would have to work for many many years to see that kind of money.Yes theses asshats are stupid, wrong and unpopular, but they are not the oppressed or downtrodden.  These are white people taking full advantage of their white privilege and there is nothing noble about representing them or making gobs of money doing so.Not saying they don't deserve representation, they do.  Just saying there is nothing noble about it.  It is just business as usual in the court system.  White folks get rich and the poor get prison.  Same ol' same ol'.so, Go for it Mike, and I hope you get a say in who plays you in the movie.  I suggest Mel Gibson.  I want a part too.As for the Hammonds, I oppose mandatory minimums too.  But considering the crimes the Hammonds committed, the plea deal they made knowing what the minimum was and all the other charges that were dropped, 5 year was a good deal, minimums or not.  I think they got off easy considering what sentence they might have gotten if they were not white.The crime there was by Hogan, violating judicial ethic and his oath to uphold the law.  the 9th Circuit should have sanctioned him.If you want to see "noble" attorneys, go to the PD's offices.  nobility is when you represent the downtrodden for peanuts, not for fame and the big bucks.  Good for Mike and Jacy for representing these idiots but they are not doing it to be noble and if Mikes believes that BS he was feeding the pop tart 4, he should return that law degree 'cause he was not paying attention in class and may not deserve it.Hey Garrett.  U of O class of '96</comment>

<comment>Here, here.</comment>

<comment>Skousen wasn't a total nut. I think thats a mischaracterization.</comment>

<comment>While I mainly agree with the points made in the opinion piece I have to disagree with Michael Arnold being held out as an example of a  noble lawyer. Mr. Arnold has been publicly reprimanded by the Oregon Supreme Court for reprehensible conduct. Case no. 07-123. As stated in the case complaint, paragraphs 5, 6 and 7, Mr. Arnold while representing the city of Florence attended a hearing at which an 18 year old female pled guilty to a charge of driving under  the influence of intoxicants. Thereafter Mr. Arnold contacted her, ostensibly for the purpose of checking up on her, and suggested they meet. On Feb. 6, 2007 Mr. Arnold drove the subject to a restaurant and purchased wine for her. The legal drinking agel in The State of Oregon is 21 years. What were his motives to break the law ? Mr. Arnold pled guilty to the conduct as described. He engaged in this conduct while married. An online search will reveal other conduct that I would certainly not refer to as noble. His law firm is now currently being looked at for its conduct involving the participants in the standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Lawyers from his firm are alleged to have unsolicited approached principals among the occupiers. This is often referred to as ambulance chasing and is illegal in Oregon. This is supported by statements that the Bundys themselves have reportedly made. There are also allegations  that the Bundys  were counseled on minimizing their legal exposure including to have the younger members of the group commit the more obviously illegal actions. I would also suggest going to the following link for a less than flattering personal account of being represented by Mr. Arnold - https:copyrightnews.wordpress.... . As I said at the beginning, this is not in the least an example of nobility. More of an example of the stereotype of a lawyer as vulture. I would have to believe the author of this piece, Professor Garrett Epps had to know most if not all of this. I now would question the professor's objectiveness, ethics and morality. This information as presented has been found using simple internet searches.</comment>

<comment>I guess you never studied the part of the Constitution that limits federal government land ownership to enumerated activities.  That is what the Bundy's stand for, upholding the Constitution and our rights. http://tenthamendmentcenter.co...</comment>

<comment>That is the provision establishing the federal Capitol complex.There are other parts of the U.S. Constitution that establish the federal government's right to own and administer public property.  Start your research by Googling the Property Clause.</comment>

<comment>Really.  Neither the Enclave Clause nor the Property Clause express any grant of authority to the federal government to own, control, or manage 640 million acres of property.  If I missed that grant of authority, I am sure you can elucidate me.</comment>

<comment>Garrett Epps may not know members of the Arnold Law Firm advised the the Bundys on how to shield  themselves while encouraging the rank and file to engage in visible crimes.  This was reported by Oregon Public Broadcasting.http://bit.ly/1Q0kKoaOur complaint is about the lawyers themselves, not their clients.I am also wondering if the lawyers at Arnold are misrepresenting who they represent.  There are deep pockets, including the Koch brothers, spending millions of dollars to try to get access to federal public lands.</comment>

<comment>The Attorney's for the Bundy militia group travelled to the stand-off supposedly to uninvited with no authority to reduce the tension.  But what they offered was Pro-Bono defense which was effectually accepted.  But later these same attorneys started a legal defense fund for the Bundy militia group.  1. We're these attorneys interfering with law enforcement by going into the stand-off and offering legal services?  2. If they offered Pro-Bono defense why were they also involved in crowd funding for legal services?  I do not know the answers to my questions.  So anyone with the any expertise on these questions I'd appreciate your views.</comment>

<comment>What's the story on Attorney Mark Arnold, handling of a DUI involving an underaged female who he took out and bought her a drink?  I understand he got reprimanded by the Bar, that doesn't speak well for ethical or responsible behavior for Mark Arnold or the Bar giving out the reprimand.  What do you think?</comment>

<comment>I hope the Bundy's win.  The Presidential Executive Branch is way way too big and out of control.  This country wasn't made to be a single-state nation.  Diversity is the key.  It's the "United States" NOT the "Presidents State"</comment>

<comment>Professor Epps, do you believe Mike Arnold is still "noble" after he bought drinks for an 18-year-old (whom he was prosecuting at the time) and was subsequently reprimanded by the bar?https://www.osbar.org/publicat...He might not be your best poster child for this argument.</comment>

<comment>This article demonstrates the self-serving sophistry and ignorance of left-wing, anti-constitutional legal academia. "Their constitutional theory, too, is toxic. It has evolved out of the semi-literate, overtly racist theories of Mormon extremist W. Cleon Skousen." First, the author's intellectual arrogance borders on the absurd. Second, I doubt if he has the first idea of what Mormonism is or what it stands for. Third, I expect that he has no real idea regarding the constitutional position of the Bundys or those who support them. I further expect that he is a firm proponent of the "living Constitution" or the "invisible Constitution" or whatever other nebulous euphemism he cares to assign to his thinly-veiled anti-Constitution philosophy. In any event, I would bet that he has little, if any, fidelity to the written Constitution that is the Supreme law of this land besides, perhaps, the few distinct provisions (i.e., the Sixth Amendment) that suit his purposes. I doubt that he understands or has even read Enclave Clause (Article I, Sec. 8, Cl. 17) or the Property Clause (Article 4, Sec. 3) or made any real attempt to square the words of the Constitution with the actions of the federal government or the federal court decisions legitimizing those actions? Does he teach the Constitution . . . not constitutional law from a case book but the written Constitution?  I doubt it.Moreover, since when is the role of a law professor to "train conscientious lawyers."  I thought their job was to teach law students the law, how to analyze legal issues, and how to then apply the law to the facts, in other words, how to think like a lawyer.  That role, however, would be particularly difficult for many legal academics, who have never been a real lawyer . . . actually practiced law in the real world for any significant period of time. Finally, the sad truth is that most law schools (including, I assume, the author's school) do not teach the Constitution . . . the history, the structure, and the actual meaning of the Constitution, starting with the actual text. No, instead, modern law professors would rather pour their ideological legal philosophies in the minds of their students.  They are a disgrace to America and the legal profession.</comment>
