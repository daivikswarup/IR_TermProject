<comment>The photo likely shows the 5 Dixville Notch locals who voted: Kasich over Trump 3-2.</comment>

<comment>I doubt it as none of them appear to be the crazy eyed mouth breathers I would expect from those results and then ones from the Democratic side.</comment>

<comment>Turnout is down from 2012 and 2008 in Dixville.This probably doesn't indicate anything but this is how my brain works now.</comment>

<comment>Blame the snow?</comment>

<comment>The towns with midnight voting cannot report results until 100% of the registered voters have cast ballots. If turnout is down, it means that the number of registered voters has dropped. The population of Dixville Notch plummeted after a resort hotel there closed in 2011:"But last year, Dixville's once-grand tradition appeared to be at risk. In 2011, the Balsams closed down, and employees who lost their jobs left the area. The remaining residents held a much smaller vote at the Balsams in 2012. This election cycle, only one candidate -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich -- has journeyed to these far northern reaches of the state."http://edition.cnn.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>ah man the Balsams closed down?I went there as a kid</comment>

<comment>Closed since 2011. It has a new owner now and is being renovated. It will reopen as a timeshare condominium; the reopening date has not yet been announced. Most of this year's nine voters are working on the renovation.</comment>

<comment>It is a mile north of nowhere.</comment>

<comment>Gee whiz! If this weren't so cute, it would be ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Haha, I know what you saying... Here's a good piece for you to read:journal-neo.org/2016/02/06/ple...</comment>

<comment>Horrible first paragraph edit.  I suspect you removed a sentence on the 3rd town not having any dems.  It made it choppy, and left me wondering where the 3rd community results were </comment>

<comment>"Rubio was roundly mocked for repeating the same canned talking point over and over during the debate under pressure from Chris Christie, and he appeared to suffer a similar laps during a rally on Monday night"That should read 'lapse', right?  I'd like to be a pedant but I'm unfamiliar with American English. In British English the author appears to have dropped an 'e'.  Which is illegal in the UK.</comment>

<comment>The correct American spelling of the word is also lapse.</comment>

<comment>Although it's obviously an error, consider the new meanings with the mistake. Rubio appeared to "suffer (a) similar laps" (meaning illicit sexual foreplay perhaps, or innocent but pathetic nonsexual embraces, one wonders which...) I find the mistaken meanings of "laps" much more interesting, than Rubio's pathetic impersonations of a robot during his 'lapses'. But then, as a poet & novelist, I simply can't help but imagine Rubio's unconscious desires to have laps, to be more interesting than his incompetent 'lapses' at candidate persuasion techniques. Perhaps the writer of the article unconsciously desired a different take on Rubio's robotic responses.</comment>

<comment>"Remember the old Wendy's commercial: 'Where's the beef?' At the end of the day, there was more meat [with Kasich] and there was less noise. To me, it came down between he and Jeb Bush. I think they were both great, but Kasich managed to stay out of the fray." -- Les Otten</comment>

<comment>Too bad Bush's name is an albatross around his neck. Can you imagine another eight years of a Bush -- that would potentially total 20 years of Bushes in the White House since 1988. Twenty years out of 36 years!</comment>

<comment>So another Clinton would be better???</comment>

<comment>The horrors of being left with a booming economy and a surplus!!!!</comment>

<comment>More like a ticking time bomb housing Crisis.......</comment>

<comment>C'mon you know better than that.I'm assuming that you were working in the 1990s If you were than you most certainly know that the fed actions in response to the early 1990 recession, the emergence of the internet/eCommerce (pets.com!), and the "Greenspan put" (from the bailout of LTCM) inflated the stock market bubble and brewed up a very nasty emerging market debt crisis.Te bursting of the stock market bubble and the 9/11 attacks led to the recession in the early 2000s.   It was the fed response to this recession that led to the much more widespread housing bubble which burst in 2007/8.Site point: people seem to forgotten the really brutal recession in the 1980s and then the pretty terrible concomitant S&L Crisis. Heck, for a slice of that era you should watch Roger and Me.</comment>

<comment>It looks like we are heading at high speed for an even worse global recession, and your next President will be a crisis manager rather than a builder.</comment>

<comment>It's hard to say.This from FT Alphaville details the challenges quite nicely:http://ftalphaville.ft.com/201...andhttp://ftalphaville.ft.com/201...</comment>

<comment>We last had that under another Clinton- Bill!</comment>

<comment>Yea, Bill did that with help from Hillary.  Just how stupid are you?</comment>

<comment>Only half as you, maybe a quarter.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, funny how that works, how the 'booming economy & surplus" comes with a left govt. Might just question why that is, and how come the undertax and overspend right policies never result in a boom.</comment>

<comment>It's like you're unable to read the comment posted by Johnny Reason RIGHT BELOW this comment.(Not that I share his opinion of Clinton, but come on, dude).</comment>

<comment>The question is whether or not we're ready for another 8 years of Paul Wolfowitz. A former member of "The Gang of Three." If you don't know who he is; I suggest that you "Google" him.</comment>

<comment>Oh, yeah. One of the architects of the Bush Doctrine.  No thanks.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Bush's name is an albatross around his neck....but his personality is.</comment>

<comment>Lol who is this weak sauce, knee quivering , beta male?</comment>

<comment>Hey New Hampshire: Remember, America is not an inherited monarchy. Say "NO!" to political royalty. Say "NO!" to Bush III (aka Jeb)! Say "NO!" to Clinton II (aka) Hillary Clinton.Take a stand for the Republic.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure any of the candidates left represent anything good for the Republic.  Ted Cruz seems to at least understand the Constitutional and limited government, but there seems to be something really off about him that offends that animal instinct in me about who can be trusted.</comment>

<comment>It's a principle thing.However, I just read this recent statement from Trump, which I liked. (Not that I agree with everything the guy says).Trump: For decades, I have warned about how our terrible trade deals are killing the middle class.  We are getting taken to the cleaners.  My message on trade has been consistent from the beginning, and if politicians had listened to me years ago we would have saved millions of jobs, rebuilt our crumbling infrastructure, and saved trillions of dollars.My candidacy is the only way to stop this terrible deal that will send our manufacturing – including our auto manufacturing – overseas.TPP allows foreign countries to cheat by manipulating their currency, making it impossible for American companies to fairly compete.  Yet other candidates in this race have voted in favor of the currency manipulation that is killing our middle class.What our incompetent leaders don’t understand is that the United States holds all the cards.  Other countries need access to our markets.  Yet we refuse to use that leverage, and we negotiate one terrible job-killing deal after another.  We buy from other countries, but they refuse to buy from us.Under my Administration, we are bringing these jobs back to America.  No more one-sided deals. Stopping the TPP is a matter of economic security and national security.</comment>

<comment>I like Trumps recent quote about Cruz, which is probably not safe for these comments.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a globalist with business interests in a dozen countries. Anyone who thinks Trump is against free trade or free movement of labor is a deluded moron (whom unfortunately are not in short supply).</comment>

<comment>Sounds like Ross Perot before Clinton signed NAFTA into law.</comment>

<comment>A 45% tariff on Chinese imports will not be welcomed by consumers. It would violate the WTO agreements and would hit Taiwan, a US ally. The displaced export producers would simply move to other Asian and Central American suppliers.I know, these are just details.</comment>

<comment>Just a "Suggestion": Build factories in Reynosa, Mexico. Just across the U.S. Border from McAllen, Texas. Hire undocumented workers from U.S.. Advertise goods:: "Buy TexMexican!"</comment>

<comment>So a ten dollar pair of flip flops will now cost $14.50?  PS  I was not a math major but I think America is not going to be too happy with that.</comment>

<comment>Trump liked Operation Wetback so much he would probably look to reinstitute the Hawley-Smoot act as well.  The only US thing it helped export was our depression.  Globalization is here like ot or not.  The only thing we can do is make actual investments in ourselves to compete.  The GOP has no interest in doing that.</comment>

<comment>Is that why Democrats have passed the world's highest Corporate taxes on America's companies, to make them more competitive?</comment>

<comment>Our effective rate is not the top, it is around average for developed countries.   When you add in the fact that among developed countries our overall tax of top earners is way below others, combined with the fact that most corporate income goes to those same top earners, we tax profits from corporations significantly less than other developed countries.  You just keep screaming that tired a$$ talking point though, cuz it's wut you blieve!</comment>

<comment>You obviously have never filed an 1120 and have no idea what you are talking about.  Add Employer paid payroll taxes  and the US is way on top when it comes to corporate taxes.   Even their dividends are taxed again at the receiving end. Yes corporations pay a low rate when they make no profit, or donate to charities etc.  But your little left wing talking points are just total socialist B.S.</comment>

<comment>You are correct.  I don't even know what that form is or what it is for.  Even so, just because you have does not make your argument any more true.  It could mean that YOUR tax rate is higher than anywhere else in the world.  Taxes vary greatly between size, type and industry.  Your initial statement was that our tax rate was the highest in the world.  It's not true.  Even if it was, that would be irrelevant to the argument of do we pay too much or too little or does our tax rate really make us non-competitive.</comment>

<comment>is that a real question? Large powerful American companies pay 0 in taxes. While the middle class living on 40-50k a year carries the burden of the rich and the poor. You should be ashamed of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Name one, a single one, that doesn't pay taxes.  PS  People earning less than 50k pay about 12% of the federal taxes collected.  You should stop being so STUPID!</comment>

<comment>Customers, employees, shareholders. That's who pays taxes. Corporations pay 0. </comment>

<comment>So the thousands of accountants filling thousands of 1120's are all wrong, wasting their time, and you are right?  What an idiot.  How does a customer pay a corporate tax?  PS  I thought you were going to name a major company that pays $0.00 in taxes?</comment>

<comment>The highest? Not in the real world. Apparently, you've never heard of Sweden, Finland, or Norway, to name only 3 that are obviously higher.</comment>

<comment>We can't compete in manufacturing, because we're too fond of not being able to see our air.</comment>

<comment>Most pollution from manufacturing comes from the energy used, we can invest in non-coal power to mitigate most of the air pollution.  Environmental regulations do cost money, though.</comment>

<comment>Except only in your little fantasy world does the US hold all the cards.We have the worlds biggest economy sure but we rely on products and manufacturing from all over the world.  You can pretend that we can just do whatever we want without consequence but you're flat out wrong.A trade war like Trump wants to start with China would hurt China but it would hurt the US just as much.</comment>

<comment>Detroit might beg to differ.</comment>

<comment>What does that have to do with anything?</comment>

<comment>Honestly that's probably the most correct and insightful thing I've read from a candidate on an economic issue lately, specifically the bit about manipulated currencies.</comment>

<comment>China's currency has varied very little over the last 20 years. Trump is full of sh*t.</comment>

<comment>Trump is not the only candidate to oppose TPP.  Sanders also opposes it.</comment>

<comment>Limited Government? No Government!</comment>

<comment>They say that Somalia is lovely this time of year.</comment>

<comment>Score: Bush 12-- Clinton 8</comment>

<comment>can anyone give me a site for live results ?</comment>

<comment>Somehow I feel like this country is fighting to awaken from a coma.  ISIS smells death on the West and we're digging our own graves just like the people they shoot in the videos.  Quite frankly, if we don't have a Trump presidency, we might as well take the suicide pill and go quietly into the night.</comment>

<comment>The Trump presidency IS the suicide pill.</comment>

<comment>Why wait? Tuesday nights as good as any other.</comment>

<comment>You first.</comment>

<comment>ISIS is terrible. But it's not gonna kill us all. Calm down.</comment>

<comment>Get a clue. It's not about ISIS.  It's about the 1.5 billion "peaceful (LOL)" Muslims flooding into Western countries.As Geert Wilders points out -http://www.breitbart.com/natio...The Islamic vote has already decided at least one major European election: the 2012 French presidential elections. These were won by the Socialist Francois Hollande over the incumbent Nicolas Sarkozy by only 1.1 million votes. Since an estimated 2 million Islamic votes participated, of which 93 per cent – 1.7 million votes – went to Hollande and only 7 per cent to Sarkozy, it was the Islamic vote which gained Francois Hollande the Elysée Palace.---------------------------------------------------And wouldn't you know it? Hollande insisted that the refugees must keep coming to France - right after the latest Paris jihad massacre.</comment>

<comment>1.5 billion?So every Muslim on the planet is moving into Europe now?you know most of them are in SE Asia right?</comment>

<comment>Its just like Obama and the Mexicans.</comment>

<comment>I suggest you put down the Kool-aid for a second and check back into reality.</comment>

<comment>You guys fancy yourself "anti-establishment," but more than any other voters, the pro-Trump doomsayers are beholden to the infotainment establishment.  They say "be afraid," and by golly, you're shaking in your boots.  So sad.</comment>

<comment>You are like a Homer Simpson-style doofus.  Lying on your sofa, eating donuts and saying "You pussies are scared of heart disease - not me!".</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>So Trump's notion of getting the Russians to fight ISIS is the way "the West" will prove its mettle?</comment>

<comment>putin-wannabee calls for state sanctioned torture as the unwashed bay for more blood. The draft dodger trump has slipped from juvenile to medieval.</comment>

<comment>I found it ironic that Trump called Cruz a p*ssy - this coming from a guy who grew up sheltered - chickened out of military service and most recently chickened out of a debate because he was scared of a girl :)Then saw his son Eric (the one with the slicked back blonde hair) saying that waterboarding was no more harmful than a frat initiation. Of course like his dad he stays in the shelter of never being in the military and growing up with body guards.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a typical bullycan dish it out but runs to mommy the second someone hits him back</comment>

<comment>So true.  If Trump does not win in NH, we'll see that sourpuss expression on his face once again... looks like he is about to start bawling... the man simply lacks the temperament to be the POTUS.</comment>

<comment>He lacks the temperament, business sense, basic human decency, geographical knowledge, legal knowledge....  If Trump had been born to average parents, he would have ended up as a toothless carnival barker.  As it is, he ended up a toupeed carnival barker.</comment>

<comment>Basically Trump is what happens when a jerk middle manager in an office is given millions of dollars</comment>

<comment>If he doesn't win NH he's done completely.  He underperformed his polls by about 7 points in Iowa but he's polling ahead by like 16 in NH.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the only fighter running!</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump attended a military school for boys... I Googled it and Wiki says:"New York Military Academy (NYMA) is a private boarding school in the rural village of Cornwall-on-Hudson, 60 miles (97 km) north of New York City, and one of the oldest military schools in the United States. Originally a boys' school, it became coeducational in 1975. On March 3, 2015, NYMA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, facing serious financial difficulties from low enrollment. Instead of opening for the fall semester in September 2015, NYMA closed and was auctioned to a group of Chinese investors who reopened the school in November."Imagine that, Trump's old Alma Mater now owned by Chinese investors... this could help to explain the man's xenophobia?</comment>

<comment>LMAO. The Chinese own it?</comment>

<comment>Yeah... here's my source on that:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...The Chinese just recently bought the place.  Trump didn't step in and save his old Alma Mater?  Oh, the shame of it!</comment>

<comment>Looked at it and saw that another alumni of this esteemed institution was John Gotti Jr. :)</comment>

<comment>Figures.</comment>

<comment>Wait...something associated with Trump went bankrupt? That's unpossible!</comment>

<comment>It's a lie. Trump did not call Cruz a "pussy". Naturally, you have no quote. Liar.</comment>

<comment>Yes he did and I have the video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>You have no quote - I already saw the video and it backs me up. You lie.</comment>

<comment>God are you stupid.</comment>

<comment>You still have no quote- because the quote shows that you lie.</comment>

<comment>If you don't think that whole thing was a setup, then I have some swampland that's a really, really huge deal.....</comment>

<comment>cough...no proof..cough.</comment>

<comment>Here's a quote:http://thehill.com/blogs/ballo...HE said he said it.</comment>

<comment>Again, you lie. You keep lying.</comment>

<comment>He repeated it but he didn't say it initially</comment>

<comment>He quoted an audience member and also scolded the audience member for saying it.</comment>

<comment>Scolded?</comment>

<comment>Last night: " ... he's a pussy"Today: "I was just repeating what she said so everyone could hear,” Trump said of the epithet. "I was doing everybody a favor."Scram, trumpkin.</comment>

<comment>"OK you're not allowed to say and I never expect to hear that from you again. She said -- I never expect to hear that from you again -- she said he's a pussy," Trump said as the crowd erupted into a roaring cacophony of laughter and applause.That's why YOU chopped off the rest of the quote - you don't want people to see the actual quote - because YOU are a pussy, Kluger.</comment>

<comment>If it was that bad why did he say it anyway?</comment>

<comment>It is OK to acknowledge that people are calling Cruz a pussy.Especially since Cruz has shown his true colors by playing dirty tricks on Ben Carson.</comment>

<comment>you're a stupid as trump</comment>

<comment>Glad your homeless shelter has wifi.</comment>

<comment>I love how you deny Trump said something but defend what he didn't say regardless</comment>

<comment>No tonight he said he repeated what the lady said. He also only mouthed the F word, never said it. He said he would never be cursing or using such language when he gets closer to the nominee. He gets so much media from this silly stuff to pay for his campaign.</comment>

<comment>Trump is as bad as the people following him (which is concerning).</comment>

<comment>No, he merely repeated what one of his supporters said. He is too clever by half.</comment>

<comment>Actually, he did.  And shame on him for denigrating pussy -- which is enjoyable -- by comparing it to Ted Cruz.</comment>

<comment>The lying lawyer is back with more lies. I already printed the actual quote - why don't you just invent your own - lawyer boy ?Sorry, America just showed that we don't need more lying lawyers.</comment>

<comment>Did you know that Trump actually went to a military school?  You know, one of the ones advertised in the back of magazines next to the fat camp ads.</comment>

<comment>If ISIS chopped off the head of someone you care about you would change your stance faster than Hillary.</comment>

<comment>So you support torture?</comment>

<comment>I would be OK with jihadists torturing progressives like you until you guys got a clue.</comment>

<comment>Stay classy spuds</comment>

<comment>Yeah? Well, if I could, I'd round up you conservatives and subject you to round the clock Gangstah Rap... you'd get a clue. (Just Kidding)</comment>

<comment>That's really cruel.</comment>

<comment>A good look into he mentality of a Trump fascist</comment>

<comment>Typical progressive. All your hate is pointed at conservatives - yet you are soft on the actual jihadists who would like to cut your body to pieces.</comment>

<comment>they're on the other side of the planet and of minimal threat to me.I don't live in fear like some people</comment>

<comment>The Republican debate would have been a lot more interesting, if they had staged a live performance of waterboarding, to prove how harmless and humane the procedure actually is... all of the candidates would be challenged to undergo the procedure, right there on the stage, to prove their manliness and that the procedure is harmless.</comment>

<comment>I guess you would have volunteered to give Khalid Sheik Muhammed candlelight backrubs so he wouldn't have to be waterboarded.</comment>

<comment>Yes, those are the only two options.</comment>

<comment>Hey, a little cold champagne, a good Cuban cigar and the Sheikh would have blabbed.</comment>

<comment>Funny though - he didn't say sh*t until they waterboarded him.</comment>

<comment>You were there, at Gitmo, in the Interrogation Room?</comment>

<comment>Were you there when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon? Or did that not happen?</comment>

<comment>I was in Uncle Sam's Army at the time... certainly the eyes of the world followed the astronauts to the moon and back.  There were no reporters allowed in the Gitmo Interrogation Room.I believe NASA, not the NSA, the CIA, or the GOP.</comment>

<comment>OK - you seem rather arbitrarily selective regarding which federal agencies you have faith in.</comment>

<comment>Arbitrarily?  Nah.  Track record.</comment>

<comment>Funny, that's not the story in the senate intelligence report, as endorsed by the GOP.  Nor the story as reported by the IG.</comment>

<comment>Technically, you are right. He started talking because of OTHER torture techniques. Happy now?</comment>

<comment>It's not like it is a hidden procedure they have done demonstrations on air a few times using volunteers.  I'm sure you can see special ops soldiers undergoing it as part of their training.Are you saying that we routinely tortured all of out Special Ops folks?</comment>

<comment>Hah you better start training for pain lib boy. Another civil war is coming and the side with all the guns has no problem using enhanced punishment.</comment>

<comment>As long as the candidates can live the high life and jet set across the fruited plain, using other people's money, they will remain in the race... bunch of welfare queens in custom-tailored suits... they need to find honest work.</comment>

<comment>The funds will dry up soon enough for most of them.</comment>

<comment>Let us hope.  These guys never quit the race until the cash is gone... and they have the chutzpah to denigrate people on welfare.</comment>

<comment>Go Bernie, Go Bernie.Storm the Winter Palace, NOW!</comment>

<comment>GO TO Trump's website, best Trade plan, controls currency manipulation, Tax plan, cuts mid. Class tax half, wall st. Pays 22% no holes, worldly compititive taxes, brings back jos and money, riches means, better paying jobs, debt payment, infrastructure, money for social programs, riches fixes alot, and mixed with immigration, best plan, check it out</comment>

<comment>Seems like the same "Don't listen to THEIR lies! Mine are better!"  that's been the hallmark of politics for years.</comment>

<comment>Here's a clue for you - both the Democrat AND Republican establishment hate Trump.That's something new, right?</comment>

<comment>not really.</comment>

<comment>and that proves what exactly?</comment>

<comment>That Trump is so awesome people on both sides hate him.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps new, but not that uncommon in 2016. Cruz also fits that description.</comment>

<comment>Too bad his past is contradictory.</comment>

<comment>That sounds like a whole lot of admirable goals.  The details on the how are a bit scant though....</comment>

<comment>Got to love in the final days the Dems go down to the usual bottom feeder points. Sanders the politics of envy and class warfare while Hilary plays the usual gender game. Pathetic. </comment>

<comment>At least neither is running to be torturer in chief.</comment>

<comment>I suppose blasting a suspect in his car and numerous dead innocent folks as collateral damage from a Obama drone attack is more humane? Lmao. </comment>

<comment>Killing an enemy is part of war, as is collateral damage. Torture is a crime against humanity. If you can't see the difference, that's on you.</comment>

<comment>It's not torture get over it. </comment>

<comment>Yeah...it actually is. And Trump said he would go a lot farther. And he said he would go after the family members of terrorists. Is this really what you want?</comment>

<comment>No comment on Trump as not my guy. </comment>

<comment>Well then what is your point?</comment>

<comment>It's not torture, but if it was you'd be ok with it?</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should ask John McCain, a man who's been tortured.You ought to try punctuation too so that people could figure out where one of your "thoughts" ends and another begins.</comment>

<comment>Wow!That Coates is one filthy racist writer.</comment>

<comment>Whoa!He's not filthy.</comment>

<comment>:)</comment>

<comment>"There's a special place in Hell for women who won't submit to being raped by Bill Clinton"</comment>

<comment>You and your "liberal" conspiracy theories...</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You haven't</comment>

<comment>The trolls are back... the conversation will now nose-dive into ad hominems and dubious canards.</comment>

<comment>I agree, canards are dubious.Everyone knows that thrust vectoring is where its at!Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>When did it become ok for HRC supporters to threaten people? Some old lady told me that I should get raped by Trump for being a Bernie supporter. Is that how this works? They claim sexism until you start asking hard questions, then it's all "you should be raped?" Is this Hillary's game plan? I promise it didn't work on me. I'm not going to let someone bully me that easy.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that an old lady HRC supporter does not have the power to force Trump to rape you.I wouldn't worry about that happening - though I am not surprised that HRC supporters would be rude or have other negative qualities.</comment>

<comment>Non sequitur - why can you put comments on any article unless it's written by that guy Coates? What is he so afraid of?</comment>

<comment>You also can't for Fallows and Goldberg.  They don't want unmoderated comments, and they don't have time to moderate them.</comment>

<comment>"What is he so afraid of?"Comments, apparently. The articles are easy enough to avoid.</comment>

<comment>This nomination, for both parties, will be more of a marathon than a sprint. Both the Donald and Bernie, the likely winners today, have serious liabilities that  are against them long term. Trump, now loudly advocating torture after advocating killing the families of terrorists, seems to be running for war criminal in chief.</comment>

<comment>Today is the day that we "The People" tell the corrupt media, the lobbyists, super PACs and big powers that we are ready for progress, don’t let the corrupt media stir you away, go out and vote for Trump, let’s make our country Great Again, it’s overdue and we all can do it, #Trump2016 NH go out and cast your vote!</comment>

<comment>...and up to this point you could be talking about Sanders.</comment>

<comment>That's pretty funny. I though he was talking about Sanders, then I got to the "vote for Trump" punchline.</comment>

<comment>We the 30% of Republican voters of New Hampshire people? How many people is that do you think?</comment>

<comment>Stir you away?Like,  with a spoon?Sounds like straight dope from the Clown Car!</comment>

<comment>Yeah!! Let's make our country great again!! Just like it was for about five hours & 42 minutes on May the 23rd, 1956!! Boy, America was great then, eh?</comment>

<comment>Only an idiot would support Trump for President.  I cant imagine a worse, more destructive candidate for this country that is currently running than Trump.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Well, Bloomberg could jump in at any moment, making it a two-way tie.</comment>

<comment>How long you been carrying that cross? lol...</comment>

<comment>But why exactly does Hillary Clinton fail to connect with the youth? Maybe it's just a language barrier. . .When a voter approached her at a polling station at Parker Varney School in Manchester, N.H., on Tuesday to ask for a picture, he explained that his friend had taken a selfie with the former first lady on Monday and he was jealous because the shot “went viral.”“You went viral?” Mrs. Clinton said to the man’s friend. “That sounds like some kind of disease.”I'm not a Clinton fan, but I find it very difficult to believe this wasn't her making a (lame) joke.  You really think she hasn't heard the term "went viral"?</comment>

<comment>I agree.  Even she can't be that out of touch.</comment>

<comment>But she was out of touch enough to imply that one of her (formerly) ardent supporters was diseased, and that she blithely assumed she could do something like that without it going viral. Derp!</comment>

<comment>If she had said tarnation....dagnabbitt....and what the flibberdiggibbett is going on around here? I could see a problem.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure she has. Sounds more like a joke that fell flat. She just doesn't have the natural ability in politics that Bill has - she often comes off a little out of touch and a tad too earnest.</comment>

<comment>It would have been funny on Veep, I think, with Veep really not knowing what the term meant (except I'm pretty sure the character has used the term).</comment>

<comment>They just released one transcript of a speech before Goldman Sachs executives on April 1st, 2015.An Excerpt:"There are 47 percent of the people who will vote for Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders or no matter what. All right, there are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it. That that's an entitlement..."</comment>

<comment>HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOOODon't forget, Americas next and FIRST woman President Hillary won Millsfieldor did you conveniently forget to put that in this report??HELLOOOOOOOOOOOOO" LETS GO HILLARY "</comment>

<comment>Are you actually excited about Hillary?  I can understand voting for her, but enthusiastically?  There was a guy who used to post here with a "Ready For Hillary" handle.</comment>

<comment>Hillary won MillsfiledWTG Hillary!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>I'm not excited over the prospect. I'd like to see an Obama 3rd term. But I'll certainly settle for Hillary given the range of actual choices out there.</comment>

<comment>Keyword: settle. That pretty much sums up why her campaign has been floundering. Good news for her is if she manages to get the Dem nomination, plenty of us will indeed settle for her and give her our vote.</comment>

<comment>Yeah....its an unfortunate word. But I'm cool with it. I think she is well prepared for the job and will for the most part do pretty well with it. I'm not necessarily looking for a radical makeover of the country. I'm ok with steady progress.</comment>

<comment>Too bad michelle is not running hey?</comment>

<comment>Don't know enough about her to say one way or the other.</comment>

<comment>I'll certainly settle for Hillary. . . Then you'll appreciate this.</comment>

<comment>And I think that's how she's going to win.  And if a nut like Trump or Cruz, or a lightweight like Rubio get the GOP nom, she's going to win in a landslide.</comment>

<comment>boredinmin is that same poster.A 400 lb fat Union slob.</comment>

<comment>So when, and how does Senator Warren enter this fray.  Post SC??</comment>

<comment>She would have to be on ballots by some deadline in March. And she'd probably need Bloomberg-type money to get the work done that it takes in most states.</comment>

<comment>Maybe she's not there as POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Boy, that would be interesting.  I heard a talking head on the tube last night talking about Sanders tapping her for Veep, but I think that would only send his already perceived very left ticket even further to the left.  I don't see her running on her own, however.</comment>

<comment>You sound like a Trump supporter trying to make Hillary supporters seem just as unhinged as Trumps'.</comment>

<comment>Bernie will win NH for the Democrats, as expected. But the margin of victory will leave Bernie and his Bros and Broettes disappointed.</comment>

<comment>Bernie already has double the delegates.</comment>

<comment>Where do you get that, with the results and percentages incomplete?</comment>

<comment>RCP</comment>

<comment>We SO don't care about Dicksville Crotch . . .</comment>

<comment>Whatever happens today I hope includes a crash and burn for Marco the bot Rubio. This guy is so far out of his depth, there is no way he should even be in this race.</comment>

<comment>But as "the pundits," who love the guy, keep telling us, Rubio is so young he has plenty of time to run and win.I'm counting on being dead by then.</comment>

<comment>He has plenty of time to grow up and get a real job first. President later maybe.</comment>

<comment>I know right , He claimed Obama knows exactly what he's doing.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is the Barack Obama of 2016. Unfortunately for Rubio, Republican voters apparently are a tougher crowd than are Democratic ones.</comment>

<comment>And with that tough vetting process, Trump is winning, yikes. The consequence of just two parties is that it pigeonholes politically polarized people (moderates, libertarians, and traditional conservatives). Rubio's shortcomings largely owe to his unpopular politics and lack of charisma.</comment>

<comment>Sanders will absolutely cream that sack of clots Clinton. Hopefully this will show the media their error in hauling Hillary's water so far. He is the candidate who can beat any of the Republicans, not that unlikeable, dishonest machine candidate.</comment>

<comment>Kudos for properly using the word media as a plural.Senator Sanders is a gentleman with an admirable record in Congress.  He has won general elections in a town of about 40,000 and in a single House district which is nearly all white.  I don't know that he has faced serious Republican opposition since his first election to the House of Representatives in 1990.The Republicans play dirty.  If Senator Sanders is nominated, they will make mincemeat of him.</comment>

<comment>People voting for the Sanders economic plan have zero knowledge of how an economy functions, let alone how 'free' entitlements work in the long term.If Sanders is elected as President, and if he had no opposition in congress, this country will resemble Venezuela.</comment>

<comment>That's a pretty big "if," though.If Sanders wins, I predict a lot like the situation we're experiencing here in the PA, with a Democratic governor who wants to raise our taxes and spend like crazy, and a Republican legislature who won't let him.</comment>

<comment>Why is Coates such a racist punk?Did his daddy abandon him?Trump will win easily.Killary will lose.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that's what the polling says.. Oops http://www.realclearpolitics.c...</comment>

<comment>Killary losing by 9 and trump up by 20</comment>

<comment>An idiot "polling" numbers out of his behind?  Works for me </comment>

<comment>Refresh RCP, Corky.</comment>

<comment>Hilarious you don't know how to properly use the interwebz.  You're old and useless </comment>

<comment>Killary lost and trump won.Get used to the sound of that, Liberace.</comment>

<comment>So you're too stupid to realize we're still in the primary? Actually this is only the first true primary </comment>

<comment>And Killary lost hard!As I said.</comment>

<comment>I'm actually a Bernie supporter.  However, I'm not silly enough to think that losing one primary means Hillary won't end up the nominee. Though I hope she does lose to bernie </comment>

<comment>Killary unravelling before your eyes.  Keep cheering for your communist.</comment>

<comment>As opposed to Caligula Trump?</comment>

<comment>Isn't Trump calling for single payor too?  So I guess you should keep cheering on your commie as well </comment>

<comment>Payer.Taxpayer.</comment>

<comment>Neither of those are sentences.  Cmon now, speak English.  You don't want us to deport you when president Trump takes office, do you? </comment>

<comment>http://www.decisiondeskhq.com/</comment>

<comment>So? </comment>

<comment>Her narrow win in Iowa came down to coin tosses that landed in her favor. She's getting spanked NH and it's going to be a lot closer in the rest of the primaries. I think there's a very real possibility Bernie will win the nom, making the poll from your RCP link irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>He was comparing Hillary to Trump.  So i link a poll that did the same </comment>

<comment>I agree with him on that count too.Trump would crush Hillary, he'd have to put on the kid gloves to avoid looking like a bully.</comment>

<comment>Oh and check this out.http://www.nytimes.com/electio...</comment>

<comment>Not a good record of picking winners. That's for sure. And unlike Iowa, not even the Dems won</comment>

<comment>I see one of those is Trump+3. Don't forget about Bloomberg either.</comment>

<comment>RCP only uses recent polls.  All the recent ones had Hillary up. I did see the Trump+3But that was from Fox </comment>

<comment>Had.   Voters are smarter.Rejected that corrupt old bag of blood clots soundly!</comment>

<comment>Why don't you write that in your Bible for further reference.</comment>

<comment>You think it is that good?</comment>

<comment>Well I hope you're right about that, but only time will tell </comment>

<comment>Bloomberg will get in. I personally can't wait. I've never voted third party before.</comment>

<comment>VICTORY!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>AP has called the race for Sanders and Trump. Boom! I love BOTH pieces of news.</comment>

<comment>Killary could not shame the crotch voters into supporting her.Hahaha!</comment>

<comment>You're just generally rude.</comment>

<comment>Killary is just generally corrupt.</comment>

<comment>But what do you personally get out of being get from your vulgar language?  Does it add credibility to what you say?  (No.)</comment>

<comment>Killary can't even buy credibility.</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about YOU.</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about the failure of your candidate.</comment>

<comment>I'm not voting for any of the candidates in my state because if you are not a registered Democrat or Republican, you don't get to vote in the primaries (unless you re-register).  But look!  You wrote a complete sentence with no profanity and no vulgarity.  I'm proud of you!</comment>

<comment>Are you the retarded grade school biology teacher?</comment>

<comment>High school, and I contest your pejorative.</comment>

<comment>Are you certain that you are qualified to teach high school level biology?In your union they allow you a decade to "fake it until you make it."</comment>

<comment>Look!  No vulgarity!  Why are you even questioning my credentials to teach biology?  You just like to poke poke poke the bear and try to find someone's weakness by goading them.  On the other hand, you offer very little to any conversation other than one-liners that perhaps you think are funny or cute, I can't say.  I prefer conversing with Fraga123 because he at least is funny.  You are just cranky most of the time with little credibility.</comment>

<comment>I bet that ignorant high schoolers boost your ego.That's probably why you chose to surround yourself with an ignorant audience in the classroom.</comment>

<comment>Teaching is one of the places where you really have to leave your ego at the door;  it only gets in your way.</comment>

<comment>They don't respect you.Your Union forces them to listen to your blather.No wonder you can't keep the attention of the class.</comment>

<comment>As I said, Fraga123 is funnier than you.</comment>

<comment>Fraga is funny.Your ignorance of biology is your real problem.</comment>

<comment>On what do you base this claim?</comment>

<comment>You babysit teens for a living.That's plenty.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha.   I derive a lot of meaning from seeing kids grow up and launch into adulthood;  it's a calling and not everyone is cut out for it.  What's your contribution?  I wonder sometimes how productive you are given your hours and hours of commenting here (you're always here).  Maybe that's your only contribution to the world, just your (lacking) commentary for the few eyes and minds who fall upon it in the commentary at The Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>You derive a salary from indoctrinating ignorant children.</comment>

<comment>It's a messy job, but someone's gotta do it.</comment>

<comment>You chose that "profession" to fill your empty soul, not their empty heads.</comment>

<comment>Children are forced to sit in your class.Never forget that.They are not drawn to you.They are forced to be subjected to your preaching.</comment>

<comment>Where did your education come from?</comment>

<comment>I have no reason to divulge any personal information here.Especially not to embarrass a babysitter like you.</comment>

<comment>But nothing you have ever written indicates that you put much effort into your own education;  so that's on you.</comment>

<comment>Your "forced" subjects are too ignorant to be able to call you out  for your dogmatic preaching.</comment>

<comment>Are you bored yet?</comment>

<comment>Not as bored as the students forced to listen to you regurgitating your stale routine.</comment>

<comment>Again, you have nothing of substance to offer, it's almost like you are a stimulus/response machine running on a program.  Someone engages with you, and you spit out an insult.  (I'm bored with you now, because you won't engage.)</comment>

<comment>Not as bored as the students forced to sit through your indoctrination.</comment>

<comment>You keep saying.  Alas, YOU have bored ME.</comment>

<comment>Killary bored the dimcrats last night.Bernie beat that old bag.</comment>

<comment>I'll have to watch it on-line while I grade students papers this evening.</comment>

<comment>Really, what do you care?</comment>

<comment>She wants to be my leader.</comment>

<comment>She has a lot of flaws. I've seen worse. Haven't you?</comment>

<comment>She is the worst.</comment>

<comment>Impossible. Think harder.</comment>

<comment>That's the bottom.</comment>

<comment>Well, alright then. </comment>

<comment>Look like it's Trump and Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Glass is half full I see...</comment>

<comment>Will Hillary cry again ? What have you done New Hampshire ? You're not supposed to make girls cry.</comment>

<comment>After Sanders' victory in NH, I predict that Clinton, Inc., is about to demonstrate how vile and ugly a political campaign can become.</comment>

<comment>Not as long as Lizzie Warren holds both their hole cards, Sanders and Clinton.  Wonder who fed Chuck Todd that most interesting question at the Democratic debate.</comment>

<comment>It's going to be "Vote Grand-Mommy, Not the Commie".Through third parties of course - the Clintons will have plausible deniability.</comment>

<comment>..it's not just the people fed-up with the establishment, Trump and Sanders having been pulling-in the Independents as well.Since the Media's promoted an incompetent Community Organizer as President, it now seems the public believes anyone can do the job ..and do it better.  </comment>

<comment>Killary can't buy any love in the northeast.</comment>

<comment>Christie is looking like the biggest loser tonight.  He knocked Rubio off his game and he's probably going to come in sixth.</comment>

<comment>Slightly off subject but I just saw a broadcast of NH voting place captains sitting at a table counting votes via pieces of colored paper - like in kindergarten. Is 2015 or 1915? Why was the voting means left to individual states and counties? </comment>

<comment>You'd rather machines made by donors count the votes ?</comment>

<comment>I don't care who makes them - just like ATMs function.</comment>

<comment>According to exit polls, Sanders beat Clinton among women.  That's a problem.</comment>

<comment>Only for Hillary supporters.</comment>

<comment>They probably didn't like being told they would go to hell for not supporting her </comment>

<comment>If Sanders wins NH, one of the enjoyable aspects will be seeing the big media dismayed, even if for just a few days.</comment>

<comment>Bernie already won.</comment>

<comment>In what universe is Billionaire Vanity Man Donald Trump on "the people's side"????</comment>

<comment>He represents the American taxpayers well enough.</comment>

<comment>No, no he doesn't.</comment>

<comment>You leeches don't matter as much as you think you do.</comment>

<comment>One man one vote sucker</comment>

<comment>That's cute.</comment>

<comment>The universe where Americans see half their jobs shipped over seas and the rest given away to 3rd world peasants and H-1B's by career politicians.</comment>

<comment>The universe where our presidential candidates aren't chosen by, "the people".</comment>

<comment>Killary loses the female vote.It turns out that blood clots are NOT presidential!</comment>

<comment>Is Bill Clinton spiteful enough to persuade Bloomberg to challenge Sanders.</comment>

<comment>LOL. Bloomberg would not get many votes- but would surely steal some from Hillary.  Both being establishment liberals.</comment>

<comment>Hooray for the smart women of NH who rejected Killary's sexist attempt to shame them into voting for her!Congratulations trump, and Bernie.</comment>

<comment>With about one third of the votes reported, Hillary Clinton's vote total is more than 4,000 more than Donald Trump's total.</comment>

<comment>Crowded GOP field , moron.</comment>

<comment>True, but more true of the various moderates.  Trump would pick up a hefty portion of Cruz votes but not much more.</comment>

<comment>I am not a trump supporter, but Killary can't buy any love.</comment>

<comment>Kasich as the runner up? ...Huh, I suppose it could have been anyone.</comment>

<comment>Zero delegates for Kasich.</comment>

<comment>Local news reporting ~15% Kasich but 0 delegates.</comment>

<comment>Sucks to be him.No money and no message.</comment>

<comment>He's just an odd fellow. Hard to campaign on that.</comment>

<comment>Kasich would be great... for a high school football coach. I could see him telling the team to get out there and win one for the Gipper.</comment>

<comment>AS long as he's not connected with Hastert.</comment>

<comment>Then-Rep. Kasich supported putting Dennis Hastert second in line to succeed the President.</comment>

<comment>Despite his low-key demeanor, Kasich successfully runs a populated, critical swing state where he was reelected in a landslide.</comment>

<comment>Here's my take on what we learned and what we didn't.Short story, Ted and Donald want the Republican field to stay as crowded as possible, the R convention is likely to be brokered, and nothing really changed between Hillary and Bernie but it's likely to get nasty going forward.http://uspoliticaleconomics.bl...</comment>

<comment>It depends on whether Bill and his boys go home, or hang around, IMO.</comment>

<comment>Bill Clinton?  He's not going anywhere for quite some time.</comment>

<comment>We'll see.</comment>

<comment>There is no way Hillary gets out of this any time soon.  As long as she's in, Bill will be around.  If Bernie wins by 30 and wins NV and SC then maybe we could talk about it but I don't see that happening.</comment>

<comment>Then stick him to environmental issues.  SCOTUS just ruled 5/4 against the Obama energy/carbon plan.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Hillary has that much control over what Bill talks about...</comment>

<comment>Then buy some new furniture for the NY house, she's done.</comment>

<comment>He's got to go</comment>

<comment>MSNBC calling Kasich for 2nd.   What will be interesting is that 3rd might take on more importance than it should because it's the only close race left.</comment>

<comment>"what riches hath not the FABLE of the Christ brought us?"Pope Leo X (1473-1521)</comment>

<comment>Sanders should be bigfooting Clinton right now.</comment>

<comment>The environment is an issue HRC will have to engage with now.  I'm not sure Sanders can.</comment>

<comment>If I were Kasich, I'd give my speech after the Sanders speech.   Let whoever comes in third give the speech after everyone's stopped watching.</comment>

<comment>Kasich's performance is the best news for Trump to date.</comment>

<comment>I think Bernie just violated her safe space.</comment>

<comment>feel the bern!!!</comment>

<comment>Tonight we see the end of the Clintons.</comment>

<comment>Don't throw away your HRC voodoo doll yet.ha ha</comment>

<comment>Jeb!!! remains pathetic. I would even prefer the dumb, insincere snark of his brother to Jebs!! whiny nonsense.</comment>

<comment>No thanks.  I can live my entire life without ever having another special needs President.</comment>

<comment>rofl</comment>

<comment>Well done New Hampshire. A commie and a nut case. No wonder no one is moving there.</comment>

<comment>Don't whine.</comment>

<comment>Bernie! The Donald!The establishment is freaking out. This is fun.</comment>

<comment>In a bizarre, twisted way, yes it is.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps it's just me, but Hillary seemed somewhat perturbed tonight, almost as if she had something on her mind that was bothering her. </comment>

<comment>She was thinking about the cash from her next payoff. Opps, I mean speech.</comment>

<comment>hillary is feeling the bern.</comment>

<comment>Yeast infection...again.</comment>

<comment>Look at how people with and without college degrees split between Sanders and Trump- http://politicsthatwork.com/gr...</comment>

<comment>That proves a college degree does not equal common sense</comment>

<comment>No it does not, although it does prove that either you or them lacks common sense.</comment>

<comment>Voting for an economic illiterate is a sign of being smart?</comment>

<comment>If it means the voter gets free stuff out of the deal, yes it is!</comment>

<comment>I guess so.</comment>

<comment>Many economists back Sanders. You can't just slant a question and expect everyone to agree like morons, this isn't Fox News.By the way, economic literacy is not common sense. Your logic is as awful as the poor excuse you call common sense.Really, there's not one honest or thoughtful idea in your Trumpian bullying insults you wished counted as intelligence.You can have the last word, considering no one will read it.</comment>

<comment>Yea, the ones who put political views over reality.</comment>

<comment>By the way, economic literacy is not common sense. Your logic is as awful as the poor excuse you call common sense.=======================I can run circles around you on any economic topic.  You don't even have the chops to discuss the topic.</comment>

<comment>Sanders wants to make everyone's college degree 'free', so that would make sense.</comment>

<comment>Great. I get to finish paying for my student loan and fund someone else's college degree.</comment>

<comment>if that 'free' college degree was only 'free' for STEM fields, I would support it. The problem is Larry David Sanders wants to make any degree 'free', so youll be paying for theater and mongolian dance studies majors.</comment>

<comment>I have always wanted to study art history (formally ... been studying it informally for 35 years now). Maybe I'll finally get my chance! :-D</comment>

<comment>On the taxpayer's dime.</comment>

<comment>Haven't you heard? The taxpayer didn't really build "that" (his wealth). It was merely luck or the wonderfulness of the collective that made it possible; therefore it is entirely appropriate for the collective to confiscate it in order to dole it out to people like me. Don't believe me? Just ask Bernie!</comment>

<comment>I know you're probably joking...but that's eerily similar to the crap I've heard some leftists say...so I don't know what to make of this comment.</comment>

<comment>She's not joking. Look at her comment history. She works part time in order to collect welfare benefits. The sad part is, the government allows someone to choose to do that.</comment>

<comment>Wow. When did our politics turn into such a parody?</comment>

<comment>I was amazed at the info I collected in order to question those in charge.</comment>

<comment>Question those in charge? What do you mean?</comment>

<comment>The government, who allows people to get away with collecting benefits they don't deserve, like Willow Girl.</comment>

<comment>And...women's studies. African studies. All those "studies" for FREE. Even if I was left wing, just THAT by itself would make me vote for someone else.</comment>

<comment>Great idea. I'll major in art history and minor in women's studies!Squee!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, now you can explain to all of us exactly why Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo were sexist homophobic patriarchs!</comment>

<comment>A couple of things on Universal/Free college.Do degree holders realize what this will do to the value of a degree?  We're talking about putting every dim witted kid you knew in High School thru college.  Flooding the market will devalue everyone's education.Changing the price of college to zero does nothing to the cost.  We will need to turn our public universities into High School grades 13-16.  You cannot support the cost structure of a university without paying for it.</comment>

<comment>You still have to pass the classes once you get there.</comment>

<comment>Most will pass as universities transition into community colleges.</comment>

<comment>Somewhat counter-intuitively, the more people with college degrees, the more valuable a college degree is.  How educated our population is is a huge determinant in how well our economy does.  When more people get well-educated, the economy surges, and most of that growth goes to people with college degrees.</comment>

<comment>LOL, what economic theory are you working with.Remember this is a pathway for the dimwitted.  Less scarce more valuable?  you need to back that one up.</comment>

<comment>Re-read my post.  That's where I explained why less scarcity of education makes it more valuable.Here, try to think of it another way.  Say that you have a college degree and a choice to live either in Somalia or the US.  In Somalia, college degrees are much, much more scare than they are in the US.  Which country would that degree be more valuable in?There are actually lots of things that are more valuable the less scare they are, by the way.  For example, a social media account- the more people have them, the more useful they are.  Or telephones- if only 10% of the people you know have a phone, your phone isn't very useful to you, but if 90% of the people you know have them, it is super useful.</comment>
