<comment>He'll be a great Veep though...</comment>

<comment>he is a loser, like all the people of Loserlana!</comment>

<comment>Way to generalize...some of us actually have brains and didn't vote for this tool.</comment>

<comment>Jindal is a loser like all the republicans who thought he was so great. Democrats in this state are the ones who see clearly and are not idiots like the GOP has become for some reason.</comment>

<comment>Doubt it.  Wise to get off the clown bus though.  Maybe next cycle the GOP will not self destruct and devolve into ridicule and shame.</comment>

<comment>Weren't they saying that after Obama's re-election though?In particular, I remember one high-profile republican saying that his party needed to stop being the "stupid party".</comment>

<comment>That's what makes this all the more enjoyable.</comment>

<comment>Republican primary voters have been very, very clear on one thing: embrace the stupid.</comment>

<comment>That was Jindal.</comment>

<comment>I'm still waiting for any of the GOP candidates to make a compelling case for their candidacy.</comment>

<comment>Motoboto Haritoto.....He was the Chief Clown!!!</comment>

<comment>Veep of what?   Repubs do not have wide spread appeal.  All they have is the rich and ignorant.  I hope you are rich.  Not only that "Bobby" is in denial of who he is.  Sad. </comment>

<comment>HA!! He'd make a great fascist, you mean.</comment>

<comment>For someone whose culture  dictates that you don't kill houseflies because of the belief that a human was reincarnated as one, I don't think so.</comment>

<comment>he converted to Catholicism. His own culture is more attuned to Christian American than Hindu.</comment>

<comment>Of India maybe.</comment>

<comment>Not even a good dog-catcher! He is in politics to run for higher office, nothing more. He is a typical South-Asia status-seeker.He spent his entire term as a congressman running for Louisiana governor.He spent his entire term as governor running for president.What would he run for as president?Since there is a limit he obviously picked the wrong country.</comment>

<comment>That is so true.  Jindal was running around to every republican site to be get noticed and as you say run for president.  I am so glad to see him bite the dust.</comment>

<comment>yeah , America needs to be broker than it already is !!</comment>

<comment>He's an idiot. He'd be a terrible VP. </comment>

<comment>Jindal badly mismanaged his mandate in Louisiana, and with his term nearly ended, has zero chance of fixing that huge stain on his resume. His future is in the political parasite industry (where he will probably earn more money, of course) as a talking head and networker.</comment>

<comment>But that "stain on his resume" was a well kept secret - it was never referred to nationally and even this article did not pick up on it. So it could not have been one of the reasons he did not catch on.</comment>

<comment>I knew he was terrible from day 1. if you rely on media for your political philosophy and judgment you will be fooled by the sentiment of the day and billion dollar campaigns.</comment>

<comment>And after one glance on the first day, what did you base your judgment that he was "terrible" on? Your political philosophy? Then a wide class of politicians are going to be judged by you to be "terrible", and apparently none of them would be given any time by you to have you change.  You did not rely on media so you did not use the sentiment of the day, and there was no billion dollar campaign around him.  How long did it take into Day 1 for you to come to your conclusion?</comment>

<comment>Having friends in Louisiana and knowing what his track record there was like? In other words, actually being informed?</comment>

<comment>The same way you judged Obama on his first day.</comment>

<comment>I did?  I thought Obama blew a fantastic chance to be a President that would bring the country together. It took some time though before it was clear to me that he did not have the talent or experience to do that.  Judging people on "Day 1" means that you judge people based on looks or crowd reaction.</comment>

<comment>>  be a President that would bring the country together.You mean he blew his chance by not appeasing a bunch of racists and anti-Democratic Republicans who would never accept him no matter what he did? I guess he doesn't have the talent to do the impossible, *sniff*</comment>

<comment>There is a video showing a "beer meeting" of Obama, Bidden, and somebody that Obama had made a mistake dealing with.  It was supposed to be about bringing people together. Look at the video, look at the awkwardness, look at the distance Obama is sitting from the fellow. Imagine a Bill Clinton in that same circumstance and you will clearly see the difference between talent and no talent when it comes to making friends and influencing people.  It would not have been impossible - Obama was easily elected.  His inexperience came through as more talented and experienced leaders such as Pelosi and Reid took over.  I don't know where you get the racist comment from.</comment>

<comment>> There is a video...All seen through RoseFlorida colored glasses. Your hinging all your argument on one anecdote is also laughable.>  I don't know where you get the racist comment from.Of course you wouldn't.</comment>

<comment>Was your introduction of race a comment on my race, your race, the author's race, Obama's race or Jindal's race? Is everyone who disagrees with you or with Obama a racist?There are countless anecdotes, and more important, outcomes, that illustrate that Obama does not have the skills to get people to work together. You claim it was an impossible task. No it was not. Biden would have been more successful at it than Obama.   This is not my private interpretation, it is a very common assessment of Obama's way of running the Executive Branch.</comment>

<comment>President Obama has the intelligence and the good will to do what was great for this country.  He came into office after Bush and Cheney had ruined so much with war. We were in a Great Recession.  President Obama did everything right to get the country back on track.  You ignorant repuk you know nothing. President Obama is why this country has health insurance and the car industry was saved.  The banks got their funds but when President Obama gave the portion he was responsible for the banks paid it back with 10 percent interest. The car industry that the GOP did not care about also paid back the funds with 10 percent interest.</comment>

<comment>Robert Draper in his book Do Not Ask What Good We Do wrote that Republican leaders dined together on the night of Obama's 2009 inauguration and agreed that the way to regain power was to oppose whatever Obama proposed.  If so they made it impossible for Obama to bring the country together.</comment>

<comment>Is that the guy who has written for Rolling Stone?</comment>

<comment>I looked him up in Google and apparently he has.</comment>

<comment>RoseFlorida...It takes "Two to Tango," in the beginning of his presidency, he did reach out but was bitten numerous times by Rabid Republicans!</comment>

<comment>I am not sure what you are calling the first day.  I knew the first day of his appointment as Secretary of Louisiana's DHH.  He began getting praise for shoddy management practices.  For making administrative processes difficult for everyone involved.  Jerking some vendors around, and making it easy for others.  Later as governor, he inflated special salaries, hired completely unqualified "hacks" to carry out his decrees.  Typical was the absolutely unqualified Bruce Greenstein, not a former Surgeons General, or NIH chief, or great physician with  credentials for organization, entomology, pediatrics,  and such, but Sales VP for a Punjab led company interested in Contracts, nothing else.  It caused quite a stir in the legislature when he was vetted (vomit).It was all on the table in the very beginning if someone wanted to look.  I had a better perspective than many thru circumstance.  That said this is water under the bridge now.   Bobby Jindal must be impeached and removed from office to end him as a political figure.  If that doesn't happen he will keep turning up with his negative influence on our government and citizens.  Many think we can just let this run it's course like a flu or plague.  We cannot.  Like many pathologies, it will hide until the environment improves for him. Impeached and Removed from Office, is the only solution.</comment>

<comment>Paul Abbott in his comment said he knew Jindal was bad from the "1st day". I was not sure what he meant by that either, but in general terms took it to mean "very early on in his announcement that he was running for the nomination" or "very soon after I learned of him (if he was an La resident).  He did get re-elected as governor - I have read the criticism of his performance in office but have no knowledge of whether it is valid or just typical "I don't like the guy's opinions and therefore everything he does yields the worst results anyone can imagine".  Did he mess up more than the ex Mayor of New Orleans during Katrina?  Did he do as much damage or have as little success as any of the federal leaders of the VA Hospital system?  If he is so bad why do you need to end him as a political figure? Does he not make a useful foil for your more intelligent and enlightened ideas?  Or is it that you are uncomfortable with democracy and fear the voters might not share your noble ideas.</comment>

<comment>It's only that I would like a world for my children, grandchildren and great grandchildren with great infrastructure, the very best of everything for a happy life. Bobby endangers that for us all. He won the 2nd time because he had no real opposition. Read Lee Zurik, who has followed him for several years. http://www.fox8live.com/catego...</comment>

<comment>Not the first day but it did not take long to see he could not do enough for the wealthy and nothing for the state.  Just another rightwing follower of Norquist.</comment>

<comment>He could go on the road with Sarah.  Two inconsequential people who don't say too much that is smart.  Bobby obviously doesn't know economics either, as he has single handedly deep sixed his state, ala Brownback, Walker.</comment>

<comment>It's not that he doesn't know economic policy it's just that the Republican policies just flat don't work. Some day they will wake up and smell the coffee</comment>

<comment>It seems pretty clear that his decisions in running the state were designed to create a record of doing the ridiculous things that Republicans think will work as an audition for higher office. He cut taxes and created serious budget shortfalls, which he then tried to make up by raising fees for services, which Grover Norquist doesn't consider taxes.</comment>

<comment>I'm not doubting you, but you should at least detail "the stain" on his governorship, lest you sound like one of those who constantly shout that Obama "doesn't lead" or has "shredded the constitution".</comment>

<comment>If you are truly as ignorant of the problems that Louisiana now suffers as a result of Gov Jindal and the massive hole his policies have blown in the state budget, or the effect he has had on the state's educational system, or his current unpopularity among people in the state or his bizarre pandering to Grover Norquist, then it would take too long to educate you to be worth while.However, if you arent too lazy to look up the requisite information, I have left you enough clues for google searches for you to educate yourself. Here is an example: Jindal + Norquist =https://www.google.com/search?...Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Thanks.  It is customary for the one making the charge to provide the details.  Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Im not making the charge.  I already know what an idiot Jindal is and recognize the massive damage his policies and behavior has done to the 'Pelican State'.  You expressed ignorance of what is considered general knowledge, so as any good teacher would, I gave you the resources to remediate your lack if information.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Since when has that ever applied to you? As far as you are concerned what you say is right just because you said it. So you have  Jindal, Palin, Cruz and all the other jackasses.</comment>

<comment>Actually, not in this medium. It's not a scholarly publication.But, to indulge your citation fetish, here's a sample of a *conservative* critique of Jindal's record by Louisianans.http://www.theamericanconserva...</comment>

<comment>It has been defined. You obviously don't pay attention or you only watch Fox who won't tell you anything.</comment>

<comment>See also: Scott Walker.</comment>

<comment>Liam781...Jindal said after his term ends, he was going to return to the "Think Tank" that he founded. I wish he would've used some common sense "Thinking" while being Governor of Louisiana!!</comment>

<comment>The author missed that the most critical error Pyiush "Bobby" Jindal made: not being born to a white American and running for a national position in a party vehemently opposed to affirmative action.</comment>

<comment>Saying that Jindal's problem is that he is not white is a bizarre statement given that one of two frontunners for the nomination is African American. </comment>

<comment>Black in US may not have economic power as White and Asian, but they surely do have political cloud, just look around all federal, state, city, government agencies, you probably has more than 70% employee, senior management are black, they control government, they are the government,  if you do not give black people what they asking for, they will let you know right way l what they can do to  your political, professional career...white american is very well scare to avoid any confrontation with Black these days... shall i name a few university presidents, or mayor, police chief did not do what black people wanted, then either got fired or "resigned" , in US, violence may not get you elected public office, but violence will get your cloud.</comment>

<comment>Well, it is about time!  Since for the first 400 years of European invasion of the Americas the Black voice was not listened to but rather was silenced by violence!  GLAD THEY ARE FINALLY GETTING THEIR POWER!!!  GO BLACKS GO!!!</comment>

<comment>None of what you say supports the contention that Jindal's problem is that he is not white.  Zilch.  Your thesis seems to be that Bobby Jindal's problem is, rather, that he is not black. It seems a bit odd to blame Jindal's troubles on race.  He was, after all, elected Governor of his state twice.  (And that was in a state with a history of racial issues.)  That's not to say that his ethnicity wouldn't have been a problem when the race got more serious, but this early in  campaigns enough republican voters seem  open to  minority candidates like Carson and Cain.</comment>

<comment>Then why are all the other Republican candidates so opposed to him?</comment>

<comment>Why did the other republican candidates oppose Jindal?  Gee, that's a tough one.  Do you think it could be because they were running against him for the same nomination?  Sort of like why Bush is "so opposed" to Trump or Fiorina is "so opposed" to Rand Paul.</comment>

<comment>Yes but we can easily say that Carson is not the brightest bulb in the republican race.</comment>

<comment>I think you're wrong about that. No one gets to Carson's professional level without being plenty smart.  And that's what makes his uninformed, off-the-cuff, I-don't-need-to-trouble-myself-with-facts statements so bizarre.I'm pretty confident that Carson is smarter than, say, Bush, Rubio, Huckabee, Christie,  Santorum, Graham, etc.</comment>

<comment>I think his biggest problem was the obvious pandering to the racism, xenophobia, and homophobia of the republican base.  It made him seem squarely and untrustworthy.  Beside this - for a supposed "policy wonk" - his policy positions were just more rabid "christ baiting".  He never came off as a serious candidate.</comment>

<comment>can I upvote this twice, because you have mentioned two valid points which both deserve their own separate upvotes</comment>

<comment>His problem is that he pandered to the vocal minority of the Republican base and mainstream justhe wasn't interested. He is a failure as a governor - why would anyone think h2 would be a good president</comment>

<comment>I think there was a time in the earlier part of the process where Gov Jindal tried to carve out a position as an 'intellectual' candidate (despite his miserable performance as a right wing Tea Party nutbag), but by the time he saw that ploy failing and started pandering to the 'lowest common denominator' in GOP politics, that bloc was already locked up by louder, more reactionary candidates.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>hate to agree with you, he is Asian, no matter what he say, or other says, people in US does not care Asian, Asian does not go on street organize violent  demonstration, burning a few blocks their own cities, robbery, kill people in day light, Asian tend do not using violence as the only mean to gain political power, so you look around, when was Democratic Party or Republic Party give a shit of Asian?</comment>

<comment>Are you sure?  I thought he was Indian.</comment>

<comment>India is part of Asia.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but we normally don't describe someone in such broad terms, but differentiate. ie...Canadian, American, German, English etc....</comment>

<comment>Jindal was born here, so he's American.  On his college application, he likely checked Asian-American.As much as the rest of that post by Bruwer didn't make sense, Jindal is of Asian heritage.</comment>

<comment>Why does he deny how he is?  Simple. He is part of the white haters party.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure Republicans are very much in love with white people.</comment>

<comment>I don't believe Indians consider themselves as Asian.  At least I've never heard of them referring to each other as that.  But, then again, I'm not Indian, so if you are, then I've learned something new today.</comment>

<comment>Wow. Just wow.</comment>

<comment>No reason to be snarky.  I know the country, India, is part of the Asian continent, but I was unaware that the actual Indian people consider themselves as Asians.  Perhaps I thought this to distinguish them from what we 'stupid' Americans think of as Asians (ie Koreans, Chinese, etc).  I acknowledged my error, so I see no reason for you to post your snobby response.</comment>

<comment>right the Asian don't protest, they just turn them women into prostitutes!</comment>

<comment>He is Indian, learn your geography!</comment>

<comment>On which continent is India?</comment>

<comment>Piyush Jindal was born on June 10, 1971, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.He is the first of two sons of Raj (née Gupta) and Amar Jindal, immigrants from Punjab, India.</comment>

<comment>you obviously haven't heard about No. Korea, China, Myanmar aka Burma, Cambodia or Vietnam, India and Pakistan, etc. etc. Asians have no special class different from all humanity. Oh and don't forget the Japanese in world war 2. And Asiatic muslims in the middle east, Russia and the caucusus and in China. the Taliban, Hamas, etc. etc.</comment>

<comment>That is a rant about how the Asians feel. They are good Americans and get not credit.</comment>

<comment>I guess that explains why one of the men most favored right now is black and another is Latino.</comment>

<comment>the person most favored overall is a WHITE WOMAN NAMED HILLARY!</comment>

<comment>What poll are you quoting?</comment>

<comment>Ben Carson and Marco Rubio are widely acknowledged as favored contenders for the WH.  Carson is beating Trump in Iowa.</comment>

<comment>Yes, two of the GOP candidates most willing to pander to the ignorance of racists and religious fundamentalists (when combined equal a majority of the Republican party) are black and hispanic, yes.  The hispanic one wasnt born in this country and doesnt speak Spanish and the black one is a serial liar regarding his past in a misguided attempt to seem more 'black'.If that is your idea of 'diversity', pardon me while I laugh in your face.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Apparently the GOP presumes that all Hispanics are the same and a Cubano will appeal to Mexicanos, Puerto Ricans, South Americans and lock in their votes...just because he's Hispanic?</comment>

<comment>The GOP likes Cubans because of all hispanic groups, they are the ones most likely to vote for Republican candidates.  What they fail to understand is that those right wing Cubans were in large part those who benefited not only from the corruption of the Cuban government by Gen Batista, but also by the 'anti-communist' insanity common among right wingers in the 1060's.I am unaware of any other group of immigrants (outside of the very wealthy that van buy their way in) who have enjoyed the kind of special status that Cubans have long enjoyed in this nation. This makes the Cubans a very specific populations and very much antithetical to the issues that are of a concern to the vast majority of hispanics in this country.GOP tokenism is laughably evident, they believe that Thurgood Marshal and Clarance Thomas are equivalent since they are both black, the think that Ben Carson is an example of diversity and that having two Cuban Americans as candidates for the Republican nomination will allow them to significantly increase the number of hispanic voters supporting their party.The best part is that the next President will appoint as many as 5 judges to the Supreme Court and that person will not be a Republican.  But the GOP base is so dumb, they think the Supreme Court is like any other court, with sour cream and tomatoes added and in this case, that ignorance works in favor of the country as a whole.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>If the minority happens to be Republican, they are fake.  Got it.</comment>

<comment>You are a complete and utter idiot, which is pretty much what I have come to expect from right wingers.Ben Carson is black, lol.  'Canadian' Cruz and the Boy Wonder are both hispanic, fine.  Neither of those 'facts' are going to increase the Republican's share of either the black population of voters or the hispanic population of voters.Only in the minds of ignorant, racist tokenists such as your self are two things equivalent just because they are the same race, ethnicity or gender.  President Obama is not President because he is black, but because he was and is the best candidate for the job.  The Democratic party did not nominate him because he was black, they did not vote for him because he was black and find it laughable that anyone would claim that Ben Carson is equally qualified to run for the presidency because he is also black.Really, STFU and GTFH, you moronic, ignorant, bigoted RWNJ.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Well that's about as intelligent and mature a response as I suspected I'd get.  </comment>

<comment>Black best friend syndrome. That's the level right wingers understand racism at.</comment>

<comment>Another Asian American politician being stuck between a rock and a hard place, courtesy of the increased tribalism in politics. Not that black Republicans have it easier.</comment>

<comment>Denying who he is was a big problem too.   He seems to not know that he is part of the "hate" repub party.</comment>

<comment>He tried to run as a redneck, but somehow people didnt buy it. 't didn't help that every statement that comes out of his mouth is absolutely stupid.</comment>

<comment>Interesting that being stupid didn't help him. It should have with today's republican party. bush was helped by being stupid.</comment>

<comment>Jindal "went wrong" when he convinced himself he had the slightest chance at the nomination or the presidency. This Rhodes scholar, who once castigated republicans for being the "Stupid Party", himself consistently came across as the very stupidest member of a party that appears to be waging a "War On Intellect" for some reason. His "no-go zones" nonsense made him look like a fool in the eyes of the world.I never understood why anyone would support this guy, especially if they knew about his record (and unpopularity) in his home state. I still don't.</comment>

<comment>Not sure why he ever ran to start with. Or Lindsey Graham, or Santorum, or...His track record in his home state is just flat horrible and he is horribly unpopular there. Actually, I know why all those self-serving assclowns ran -- to feed their own egos and to get a jump on careers as talking heads. They can all work in the punditsphere forever now.</comment>

<comment>I was just thinking about the various dropouts we have seen and will see. They've been sort of drip, drip, drip up till now, but the primaries are coming up! At some point we will see three of them quitting in one day, or eight within a week, or some such.</comment>

<comment>I will never understand how an Ivy League grad and ostensibly  smart guy can sound so damn stupid.</comment>

<comment>In the GOP, it is a requirement.  Show me any Republican with an impressive educational pedigree that demonstrates concomitant intellect in the political arena.  Being smart is a requirement for any Democratic leader, as is being seen to be smart, but being ignorant, bigoted and hypocritical is requisite for the other side now.I hate seeming so Manichean, but I havent seen a single Republican politician I could reasonably support since the retirement of Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME).Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>I could get behind Kasich this time around, and I would have voted for Huntsman in a hot minute back in 12. Unfortunately Kasich's odds of getting the nom are as poor as Huntsman's were four years ago. I'm disgusted enough with the Dems that I would jump ship if there was a reasonable alternative. Unfortunately "reasonable" is not in the GOP vocabulary.</comment>

<comment>Kasich is an evil, fundamentalist right wing reactionary who is only reasonable in relation to the other current candidates for the GOP nomination.Huntsman, as a person who not only spoke a foreign language, but was once President Obama's Chinese Ambassador, was a complete and utter non-starter from day 1.  Also, I think his candidacy predates Sen Snowe's retirement and I wouldnt have voted for him over President Obama.Having said that, I was hoping that Sen Webb would have been a (much) better candidate than he was and that he would be more like Sen Webb, rather than former Reagan Sec Navy Webb.  However, his position on the Iran deal proved me wrong on that count and his abysmal performance in the first Democratic debate turned him into a bad punchline, rather than being the capable and qualified candidate that many of us were hoping for.As a member of the VFW and someone who believes that the reform and usage of the military is going to be one of the major challenges facing the US in the future, I was hoping for a real veteran candidate, but this isnt going to be that year.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Yes, I really like Webb, but he DQ'd himself right away.</comment>

<comment>I wrote a long email to Sen Webb after he retired from office in 2013, asking him to consider a run at the Democratic nomination, because I felt the country really needed him, as trite as that may sound.  I know there are a lot of problems in Webb's past, opposition to women at West Point, support for the Battle Flag of Northern Virginia, the circumstances of his resignation from the Reagan administration, but I felt that his performance and po9licies during his time as Senator had shown considerable evolution and increasing political sophistication, although once again, his resignation from office was a troubling sign.What I was hoping for was a veteran's skepticism of the use of military force, a wary eye toward the bloated budget and lack of accountability of the military and a willingness to grasp the nettle of reform, military, criminal justice, drug war etc.  Unfortunately what I saw during the campaign was someone who was not willing to forcefully establish a position despite the strong advantage of being the first to declare as a Democratic candidate, no ability to present his vision to a wider public to generate new supporters, no use of news or talk show positioning to increase name recognition (ala Bernie Sanders, the junior Senator from my state whom I dont like much) (however I love the hell out of Sen Leahy) or any of the other things I might have expected from an underdog with significant political experience, a great resume and a number of policy positions that the majority of politically moderate Americans could support.Needless to say, the first debate was the final coup de grace in his campaign and that I thanked my lucky stars that I had stopped trying to talk Webb up before that point.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>I like Webb as well, even though for some reason I find little we agree on policy wise. Still he seems like his heart is in the right place.</comment>

<comment>I have to assume he is doing it on purpose, playing a role like an actor would. Remember, actor Ronald Reagan played the role of president for eight long years!</comment>

<comment>Being educated and being smart are two separate things.</comment>

<comment>At that rate there would be no Republican candidate left. What then?!</comment>

<comment>Then the party's over, I guess.</comment>

<comment>And the hangover begins...</comment>

<comment>Slumdog Millionaire was hot for 20 mins and  then done</comment>

<comment>He is too much like everyone else.</comment>

<comment>In a sense, Jindal is a too-accurate reflection of a know-nothing party. No one, with the very partial exception of John Kasich, is vying to educate the party's base about the challenges of governance. Instead, it's just spit wads and and wedgies to persuade that ineducable base that he can be as crude and ignorant as they are. The problem is not so much Jindal's inability to perform like a killer clown in a bad circus. It's the circus itself. It's toxic, it's moronic, and it's as vile as anything we've seen in this nation's history.</comment>

<comment>"The Louisiana governor failed to make a compelling case for his candidacy"Perhaps, but maybe his attempt to become the pandering poster boy for the "party of stupid" was so glaringly false that the good folks noticed. He was inauthentic in his Republican rage; anyone could see it.This is to say, in Jindal you have a guy who, based on his pre-political education and career has to be a really bright, well-educated guy. So it is my guess that he wasn't able to "pitch" his stupid policy positions correctly. He was that guy in the choir who is just a bit off pitch. That will never do when you have Trump, Carson and Cruz the three tenors of reactionary Republicans in the mix.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget the fact that he has also been a miserable failure as governor of Louisiana and is hated by his own party colleagues within the state!</comment>

<comment>Maybe the fact that his own state, the one he is governor of, is falling apart is the underlying reason it "wasn't his time".Sheesh. Another hateful right wing egoist bites the dust. Now start working on that book, Bobby.</comment>

<comment>Bobby be bad.  And not of the ghetto variety of bad.  Even by klown kar standards he's a mix of hate and amateurishness.  You always get the feeling with Bobby that he doesn't quite get the American culture.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.  He grew up in the United States so of course he knew all about the American culture.  He went to Harvard and was a scholar just not a decent governor.</comment>

<comment>He went to Brown.</comment>

<comment>And Oxford (as a Rhodes Scholar).</comment>

<comment>In high school he dressed like Alex P. Keaton, the conservativehigh schooler played by Michael J. Fox in the ’80s sitcom “FamilyTies.”“He had a bow tie with dollar bills on it,” said ElaineParsons, whois now a history professor at Duquesne University.“When the movie ‘Wall Street’ came out, he’d go aroundsaying, ‘Greed is good!’ People would roll their eyes athim.”For years, Jindal bought bags of candy that he would keep in hisbackpack and sell individual pieces to sugar-craving students.  Todaythe Great State of Louisiana is his big bag of candy and he is stillselling individual pieces.</comment>

<comment>It's not in the resume, my friend.  He's narrow minded and assumes most Americans are the same way.  Moreover . . .but you yourself already mentioned his dismal record as gov. of Louisiana.</comment>

<comment>True about the exorcism.  Check out the online film about the appalling incident: Ivy League Exorcist: The Bobby Jindal Story</comment>

<comment>I think the GOP is being taken obver by the rubes they thought they'd use and control.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget Grover Norquist foot-groveller in that list of character traits.Jindal has pretty much single-handedly torpedoed the economic stability of the state of Louisiana, gutted health care and education and given way to crony-capitalism tax credit handouts to his favorites.Good riddance to him as a governor and good riddance to him as GOP candidate. This is the best decision of his political career.</comment>

<comment>Come on gang, this chap is weird as hell, even by klown kar standards.  A few years ago when he was running for president, he was asked why he left the Hindu religion, his Indian wife next to him crinkled up her nose at the mention of their former religion.  Not the sort to go very far, even, apparently in Louisiana.</comment>

<comment>I thought I would get some insight into why Jindal did not catch on. Instead I got the usual stuff tossed at governors: neglected the state while going after a national job, switched positions.While there have been many who were elected without any special qualities, when you want to stand out from a crowd you do need something different. Whatever it takes Rockafeller, Reagan, Clinton and Obama had it, the Bushes, Carter, Nixon, Dole, Kerry, Mondale, McCain did not.</comment>

<comment>He had a chance to be the GOP's serious intellectual reasonable conservative, a spot John Kasich is also about to find out will not lead to the presidency this time. But the GOP needs one desperately, who hangs in there long enough for the radical conservatives to be humiliated nationally and to lose influence. Bobby pandered too much, lost his dignity in this race, and, not to be forgotten, ran his state poorly. It was a trifecta of errors due to impatience and excessive ego.</comment>

<comment>All of this and then some. Arguably, for his second term as LA governor, he hasn't run the state at all - he's been too busy visiting Iowa and issuing stern statements against the president to be bothered to do his actual job (and as such, is broadly loathed by pretty much everyone in the state now). And the pandering, good god - there wasn't a single position he wouldn't happily switch if he thought it would purchase favor with the crazies in the GOP base.The only downside to his campaign crashing and burning is that he deserves *so much more* mocking, scorn and humiliation.What's the over/under on how long it takes him to re-surface as a Fox News contributor?</comment>

<comment>And Romney back during his buildup to the '08 election.  IIRC, the Globe reported he was outside of Massachusetts like 200 days per year by the back half of his last gubernatorial stint in the Bay State.</comment>

<comment>IMO "serious intellectual rational conservative" is an oxymoron</comment>

<comment>Clears the field for the Mike Huckabee surge. . .haha</comment>

<comment>"Jindal badly mismanaged his mandate in Louisiana, and with his term nearly ended, has zero chance of fixing that huge stain on his resume. His future is in the political parasite industry (where he will probably earn more money, of course) as a talking head and networker."Agreed. The article's suggestion that there is any actual wonkness is misplaced (though i do not doubt that he honestly sees himself that way). But bottom line, he is and has always been a flimflam man, even if he himself believes his own nonsense.  But the truth of his incompetency became clear publicly so quickly that his only professional political future will be in peddling retarded ideas to the stupid. Hopefully.</comment>

<comment>Where Bobby Jindal went wrong?   He got into the race.</comment>

<comment>Jindal’s White House dream was ended a few years back when he give Republic Party response in front TV camera at an empty of conference room, looks like afraid chicken.Jindal’s ultra conservative approach on everything, mix his religion with goverment policy may get him elected in Louisianan, but for rest of country, is go nowhere,  he does not know how to connect with audience, he is not Bill Clinton nor he is Donald Trump</comment>

<comment>The future never looked bright for this utterly empty, soulless man. Good riddance.</comment>

<comment>He made a mess of his state and it's budget. The recovery in Louisiana is slower than most of the rest of the nation. Walker did the same thing in Wisconsin. Perry's Texas did well only because the price of oil was through the roof. These guys are far from the best the GOP has to offer.</comment>

<comment>Really all Jindal did was whine incessantly about Obama when he wasn't pandering to the right wing religious wackos. If Conservatives are so into the whole 'independent and self sufficient' thing, why are they always blaming liberals for their problems?</comment>

<comment>Where did Bobby Jindal go wrong? In thinking he ever had even a whiff of a chance at becoming the Republican nominee, let alone President of the United States. The last thing we need in the White House is a Christo-fascist exorcist.</comment>

<comment>Now he can go back to his day job: dismantling Louisiana.Next up on the "failed Governor running for President" to drop out: Chris Christie.</comment>

<comment>I put his odds even with those of John Kasich.</comment>

<comment>Ahh, the joy of political side betting ;-)</comment>

<comment>.A member of the Christian Taliban will never be elected president... It's politics are too far to the right... No Congress (even this one) would even try to pass his agenda once the rewriting Lobbyists got ahold of it, and the American People would impeach him if he tried..</comment>

<comment>First he criticized the GOP as the "party of stupid." Then he tried to outdo them.</comment>

<comment>Tried or succeeded beyond his wildest dreams?</comment>

<comment>Is Bobby Jindal the GOP’s Obama?I remember seeing headlines like this shortly after Jindal was elected. What was the media trying to say? That if you find a non-white, well educated Republican, that's all it takes to qualify as another Obama? The media have a way of hyping up potential candidates. What's funny is that many of those people start to believe in their own hype. Scott Walker, Jon Huntsman, Fred Thompson, and Bobby Jindal. What do they all have in common? They're all people who were held up by the media as Republicans who could ride in a white horse and save the Republican party. All them tried and failed miserably. Maybe the lesson here is to not listen the media, but the actual public. Hint hint, John Kasich. Outside of some right-wing pundits, I don't know any Republican who was ever excited about Jindal. I bet a lot of conservatives saw the dark skin and foreign name and immediately thought he was a Muslim. Apparently, Jindal himself knows that his background can hurt him. I guess going by the name Bobby instead of his birth name Piyush and allowing his official portrait to show him with white skin was his way of countering his "foreignness". And it's really funny that he or the media ever thought his "wonkishness" would appeal to conservatives. Since when have these people cared about policy ideas?“Can you trust someone who is so changeable? While I think that anybody has the right to change his/her mind, Jindal has made a career out of adapting his thinking according to the changing direction of political winds.”In other words, Bobby Jindal isn't the GOP's Obama. He's their Hillary.</comment>

<comment>We don't need another HILLARY cause we already have the best and original!  GO HILLARY!!!  After voting twice for OBAMA, I cannot wait to vote for HILLARY</comment>

<comment>In other words, you want a shapeshifter.</comment>

<comment>Don't care what shape she is, HILLARY is the SMARTEST person in WASHINGTON DC!!!  WHICH IS WHY THE GOP IS SO SCARED OF HER!</comment>

<comment>Do you think your arguments are more persuasive because you put them in all caps? I won't be voting for Hillary. She's a Republican trying to pass herself off as a Democrat.</comment>

<comment>SHE IS STILL THE SMARTEST PERSON IN WASHINGTON, DC</comment>

<comment>No, she's just smarter than fools like you, that's all.</comment>

<comment>wanna see a fool AND A SLUT?  Look at your daughter!</comment>

<comment>.Someone obviously conned him into thinking he was first in line to become Ted Cruz's vice president..</comment>

<comment>He probably has a better shot at that now that he has bowed out.</comment>

<comment>worst state with education poverty this fraud  was used by the republican party to hide behind the overt racsismjindal was window dressing as is carly</comment>

<comment>Wait a minute.. Jindal was seriously running for President? I thought it was a joke the entire time! When I heard he was running for POTUS just like Lindsey Graham I thought for sure it was part of the joke.</comment>

<comment>Jindal is the man who once called upon Republicans to stop being the "stupid party."  How lamentable that since then he himself has all but forgotten his own advice, and his party's base is about to nominate of of the two most stupid candidates any field of primary contenders has ever produced.  Ah, the "Grand Old Party" indeed....</comment>

<comment>If memory serves, didn't he commission his official LA Governor's self portrait to be painted with a lighter skin tone than his normal swarthy complexion?</comment>

<comment>Yes but that's a picture of him after he gets into heaven.</comment>

<comment>No, that was a portrait given to him as a gift by a supporter.  His official portrait portrays his skin tone accurately.</comment>

<comment>Two things killed any chance that Jindal may have had for higher office.First, after correctly pointing out that the GOP was at risk of being seen as the "party of stupid" if GOP candidates kept making statements inconsistent with science, he then made a series of statements inconsistent with science.Second, he placed ideology over practicality and as a result drove the Louisiana budget and the Louisiana economy into the swamps.</comment>

<comment>"Where Bobby Jindal Went Wrong" was looking in the mirror one morning and saying to himself, "You know, I could *totally* be President.  I've done such a bang-up job here in Louisiana, let me bring that magic touch to all of the US."  Applies also to Christie, substituting NJ for Louisiana, obviously.  I can't wait till *that* fat fnck withdraws from the race.</comment>

<comment>Ah, another non-NJ voter basing their comments on silly news. Another relative of an "embattled" NJ public worker.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I *am* a NJ resident, and have seen first hand the damage that fat fnck has done to my state.  I challenge you to cite a single accomplishment of the Christie "administration."  He has accomplished literally nothing during his tenure, apart from p!mping Superstorm Sandy for Federal money - which hasn't even made it to those affected by the storm - and telling Rand Paul to fnck off.</comment>

<comment>Me too and agree with all you wrote here.  4 more years of Corzine would have been preferable.</comment>

<comment>I am a NJ resident and all I can say is Thank You Mr. Christie.  He has a difficult task dealing with the overwhelmingly Democratic political culture, that he has made any progress is a wonder.</comment>

<comment>Christie can't even keep his own campaign promises in NJ.  He just missed another billion dollar payment to the pension fund.  Fun fact: Last NJ governor to fully fund the pension system was Florio.</comment>

<comment>Christie is corrupt even for New Jersey.  You need to read the New Republic article.  Christie even kowtowed to George Norcross.https://newrepublic.com/articl...</comment>

<comment>Based on the polls--he went wrong, when he got out of bed.</comment>

<comment>No good ol' boyz were gonaa vote for Piyush. And guess why? He just doesn't fit.</comment>

<comment>Good ole boys elected him governor twice.</comment>

<comment>Easier to have brown brother F things up that way---since anyone with a different complexion wouldnt be allowed to rule the roost. Piyush that!</comment>

<comment>Occam's Razor's short answer: He wanted to represent the Stupid Party, a label of his own making.</comment>

<comment>Wow. A story on where Jindal went wrong that dismissed the clusterfuck he made of LA in a throw away line. That is a huge failure by the writer here.</comment>

<comment>For starters Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal picked the wrong political party for being a minority US citizen.Furthermore he decided to join the other 13 GOP contenders in the run for the White House considering that some in that group are very high profile individuals and not in a good way.At least for Mr Jindal, he did the right thing and quit the race,others should do the same thing and quit,in fact they should all quit because none of them will ever sleep in the White House. I doubt that Hillary and Bill Clinton will even invite any of them for morning coffee and cake.</comment>

<comment>President Sanders certainly won't invite him.</comment>

<comment>He better find a paying position somewhere in politics, because he could never run a 7-11 with his understanding of economics.</comment>

<comment>R U serious?! He totally destroyed his state. Who the fudge cares where he radiated from or from where his parents came. Are you saying how well Trump is doing and his parents came from Germany? </comment>

<comment>every thing points to the fact that he is not truly interested in taking the reigns of real power..</comment>

<comment>Joining the Republican party.</comment>

<comment>"Where Bobby Jindal Went Wrong". Louisiana?</comment>

<comment>Supposedly Trump said of him  "Look at that face!" At a cocktail party </comment>

<comment>Nobody was enthusiastic about Jindal, base or establishment. He had no reason to be in the race. He had no defining issue. He had no weight. It's the same reason that we will see a fair amount of people dropping out soon.It's that simple. It didn't really have much to do with the fact that he is the kid of South Asian immigrants or even his record in LA.</comment>

<comment>He's the most hated politician in La.  A complete narcissist.</comment>

<comment>"Jindal’s failed White House bid was marked by his struggle to clearly define an identity as a candidate. Voters were left confused as to exactly who Jindal was and what he stood for."Or, crazily, voters knew exactly who he was and didn't like his policies or leadership ability. I know. Weird.This is another article that tries to explain how politicians fail based on messaging, as opposed to the fact that perhaps Americans did not agree with anything that he exposed throughout his entire career.</comment>

<comment>Exactly! Thank you!Sooner or later, when they've exhausted every other possibility, the media might eventually begin to speculate that the dismal performance of every mainstream Republican candidate in this primary cycle (and the equally dismal performance of the last two nominees) might be due to the fact that Americans increasingly have a problem with the substance of the GOP's message, rather than its messengers.</comment>

<comment>It is unfortunate that one reason writers resort to this is that when they do call them out on something like their basic budget math not working, you know, because of how addition and subtraction work, they are vilified for being biased against Republicans.  I don't envy a political writer during primary season.</comment>

<comment>I hadn't thought of that angle. My assumption had been that journalists tend to harp on style over substance because gaffes and zingers draw more clicks and are easier for their readers to absorb. . . but on reflection I think your theory is probably more accurate and fairer to political journalists.Political editors, on the other hand. . . .</comment>

<comment>I agree.I'm sick and tired of these political operatives who claim "we lost because we failed to get our message out there." Wrong. You succeeded in getting your message out and the majority didn't like it. So you deservedly lost.</comment>

<comment>Jindal's mistake is believing that Americans are as stupid as the citizens of Loserlana!</comment>

<comment>What happened?  Well, the original comment was made in 2008.  That was when he was first elected Governor.  Now that he has been in office for over six years, no one wants him doing to the United States what he has done to Louisiana.</comment>

<comment>Jindal hurt Louisiana, and its people, in a failed attempt to impress the Koch Brothers.</comment>

<comment>Where Jindal went wrong was not his fault....He was born!</comment>

<comment>Destroying the economy of Louisianna didn't help.  You can't run a state with Grover Norquist looking over your shoulder unless you want to run it into the ground.</comment>

<comment>Bobby went wrong by not realizing that his skin is too brown for the republican party.</comment>

<comment>The only reason he's not the most disastrous ideologue governor in the country right now is because Sam Brownback is even worse.Even so, he has completely cratered Lousiana's government. The state's finances are a mess, and it's due in large part to his prioritizing the demands of conservative DC activists like Grover Norquist in the hopes for scurrying favor for his Presidential run over the needs of actual citizens.It's worth pointing out that the governors in the GOP race still standing are the far more pragmatic Jeb Bush, John Kasich and Chris Christie.  All of the ultra conservative darlings have dropped out. Which suggests that there is still some value to, you know, actually governing. </comment>

<comment>He went wrong when he first opned his big mouth!</comment>

<comment>Bobby went wrong in thinking that anyone wanted him to be president. It is know as delusions of grandeur.</comment>

<comment>Many have asked why Jindal might have thought of himself as presidential material in the first place.  Jindal was a Rhodes Scholar.  The Rhodes alumni have a large and effective network that promotes Rhodes Scholars, particularly in politics.  They always want to have candidates in the mix. Bill Clinton was one, so was Bill Bradley. I don't know who else now in the public eye was one, but you can bet they will be promoted.  The surprise is that Jindal does not fit the center-liberal mode Rhodes Scholars typically are in.</comment>

<comment>Bobby Jindal went wrong when he decided to sell out his morality and his intelligence for dreams of great power and financial fortune.Jindah isn't a stupid man - just a greedy, power hungry man.</comment>

<comment>I think it all went wrong with his howdy doody state of the union response.https://www.yahoo.com/politics...</comment>

<comment>If he is not impeached and removed from office, it will be Howdy Doody time all over again and again.</comment>

<comment>Three things. 1.) Jindal (and all republican presidential candidates) fail, because his message is incredibly narrow and offensive to the broad majority of Americans. Just because it plays well on Fox News and talk radio does not mean it resonates with mainstream Americans. 2.) Results matter. Jindal has a horrible resume for someone entrusted with governance. The presidential campaign, at its most basic, is a lengthy job interview. Even conservatives reviewed his qualifications and rejected his candidacy. 3.) He started from the wrong place, so he wound up in the wrong place. Jindal's campaign (as well as that of all other that republican office seekers) was based on what HE wanted, not what is best for the country. Witness the fact he confessed, "This is not MY time." The GOP is faced with the need for a sea change in philosophy, before it will ever be truly relevant in U.S. politics. While it might artificially retain control of state houses and the House of Representatives for the short term by gerrymandering congressional districts, it will lose that leverage as more states remove control of drawing districts from the republican dominated legislatures. If it is wise, the GOP will prepare itself by jettisoning both its narrow political philosophy and candidates that represent it.</comment>

<comment>Republicans control the majority of Senate seats and the vast majority of Governor's seats, neither of which are "gerrymandered" as they are statewide. Maybe instead of whining about being shut out of elections due to "gerrymandering", Democrats should try good governance and ideas which appeal to people. Of course, lucky for me and the GOP, your message is so hijacked that isn't going to happen soon.</comment>

<comment>which is why it is so important for Democrats to import more voters receptive to their Orwellian Fascism!</comment>

<comment>Check again. The fascists are on the right,</comment>

<comment>NAZIS were fascists and had SOCIALIST IN THERE NAME!!1! iPSo FActO----ergo sUm---DUMBocrats are FACSISTS</comment>

<comment>Just like the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a democracy.</comment>

<comment>Not really, Most of the fascists are on the left.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for demonstrating your ignorance of politics.  Fascism is definitionally the most extreme right on the political spectrum.  It is a term coined by Mussolini.</comment>

<comment>"Fascism: a governmental system led by a dictator having complete power, forcibly suppressing opposition and criticism, regimenting all industry, commerce, etc., and emphasizing an aggressive nationalism and often racism."So some here are claiming the above definition means "right wing", and in some sense that might fit - if aggressive nationalism was connected to extreme right wing.  But racism is not exclusive to the far right wing and can just as well be found in extreme leftist politics.As far as a "dictator" goes, much more likely to be found with support among the far left than the far right.  "regimenting all industry, commerce ..." we are looking at extreme left wing all the way.</comment>

<comment>Certainly republicans currently dominate governors' mansions, state legislatures, the House and Senate. That is indisputable, but that's about as far into reality as your comment wanders. To use a term you and the conservative echosphere like, the GOP "hijacked" the democratic process five years ago by doing one admittedly smart thing. It took advantage of democrat and independent voters' habitual failure to participate in off-year elections. Our bad, for sure. As a result, you were able to apply small numbers to win political control you wouldn't have if we had met our responsibilities and turned out the vote. 2016 is a presidential election year and will see large democrat/independent voter participation, so expect to be overridden in many places you currently control. Certainly not everywhere, but in many places. That change has already begun, even in very red states. Consider Arizona and Ohio that have passed laws (by popular vote) to remove authority of drawing congressional districts from their republican controlled legislatures and assign it to an independent panel based on census numbers--not political party control. Also, the U.S. Supreme Court is reviewing a case from my state that accuses the GOP of artificially drawing districts for the sole purpose of retaining power. So "gerrymandering," or its actual application, is a real and widespread tactic used by the republican party. And one final note. Republican "control" of the House and Senate is an illusion, especially when you consider any progress those two bodies make is entirely dependent on democrats. Just think about the absolute disaster of the recent change in speakership as well as the coming implosion of Ryan and his continually diminishing alliances. The GOP made a deal with the devil (Tea Party), and now that Faustian debt is due. How can a train wreck get more wrecked? Something tells me we'll see.</comment>

<comment>What you fail to mention is that the GOP won control of the House in 2010, before the gerrymandering even began due to the 2010 Census. Again, it is due to your party's inability to appeal to voters outside of certain urban centers that makes you vulnerable, not gerrymandering or off year elections.As for next year, I see no trend in the Democrat's favor. The off year elections this year certainly didn't foreshadow a Democratic landslide, which will be necessary for them to take back the Senate. That you will be running an old, poorly received candidate at the top of your ticket next year while the Republicans run Rubio will not help your cause. Of course, even if you manage to eke out the Presidency, you will still be unable to pass any sort of legislation without serious compromise with the Republicans in the House (and most likely Senate).</comment>

<comment>I "failed" to mention it, because that's a falsehood--one typical of people living in political denial. Consider this statement on the home page of "Red Map." a republican organization dedicated to leveraging re-drawn congressional districts to retain and grow GOP control over governorships and legislatures. "Republicans enjoy a 33-seat margin in the U.S. House seated yesterday in the 113th Congress, having endured Democratic successes atop the ticket and over one million more votes cast for Democratic House candidates than Republicans.  All components of a successful congressional race, including recruitment, message development and resource allocation, rest on the congressional district lines, and this was an area where Republicans had an unquestioned advantage."  Those are the words of YOUR leadership, not mine. Believe what you want to believe, but when you decide to come back to reality, prepare for a shock.</comment>

<comment>What? No, it isn't a falsehood that the GOP didn't win in 2010 based upon gerrymandering. They were using the same districts drawn in 2000, and those districts were the same ones that Democrats used to gain a majority in 2006. The 2010 Census was ongoing during the elections of 2010, and districts weren't redrawn until 2011 and later. Even the Redmap project you talked about said that:That effort, the REDistricting  MAjority Project (REDMAP), focused critical resources on legislative chambers  in states projected to gain or lose congressional seats in 2011 based on Census  data.Now, you might have a point if you say that gerrymandering affected the 2012 and 2014 races, but you would also have to concede that the Democrats do it too in states they control. It isn't just one party creating "safe" districts.Furthermore, Senate seats and Governor's are statewide elections. Gerrymandering doesn't affect them, and doesn't explain Democrats lack of appeal in those cases.</comment>

<comment>I can't speak for other states, but here in Texas, the redistricting/gerrymandering process began in 2003, when the newly elected (and very small) Republican majority went to great lengths, including a challenge that made it to the Supreme Court, to do mid-decade (instead of post-census) redistricting. They drew districts that increased their majority in the state legislature from (I can't remember the exact numbers, but these are pretty close)  approximately 78-72  to about 100-50. The Congressional delegation went from about 16-14 GOP to about 25-5 GOP. That's a 10-seat swing in Congress just from Texas alone. You have a fair point about statewide races like senator and governor, but I'd point out that in 2012, Democrats across the country received more total votes than Republicans in Congressional races, yet lost seats in Congress. That's a pretty resounding victory for gerrymandered districts.</comment>

<comment>The Texas example doesn't change anything I said. They were an outlier with regards to their mid decade redistricting plan, which is why it gained so much attention (and lawsuits). The Republicans still lost the House in 2006, after the Texas redraw, by the way.That Democrats received more Congressional votes in 2012 shouldn't surprise anyone, and doesn't point to gerrymandering, it points to turnout. It also means that some congressional districts are representing more people than others.</comment>

<comment>My brother lives in Maryland. The congressional districts there look like blots on a psych test.  It was not a Republican administration that did this.  He lives in a rural area but in part of a very long and narrow finger coming out of a Baltimore area that just about guarantees his vote will not count, the rep will be a secure seat for an inner city incumbent.</comment>

<comment>Yet they get NOTHING done. How are you enjoying the Obama care compromise? </comment>

<comment>I am fine with gridlock, and only basic funding getting passed. The less damage the federal government does, the better.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I hate it when a Congress is judged by how many laws it passes.  I am glad that the typical politicians need to "do something" has been thwarted somewhat.Maybe all laws should have a sunset clause mandating a time when they have to be reviewed and repassed. If a law is any good it should survive a periodic review, should it not?</comment>

<comment>Right. Congress will deal with these reviews in an expeditious manner.</comment>

<comment>Republicans do have the majority of Senate seats, but the 46 Dem Senators represent more actual people than the 54 R senators do.I'm not sure how it shakes out on the governor front, but its probably close to 50-50 on population there as well.</comment>

<comment>Not that it matters, but you should look at the maps for both of your claims. You are overestimating the Dem holdings.</comment>

<comment>"Democrats should try good governance and ideas which appeal to people." And ideas that work. It is no surprise that cities with some of the worst problems traditionally have had Democratic administrations, almost as permanent features.</comment>

<comment>I don't really think it was or will ever be "your time".</comment>

<comment>Touted by the DC navel gazers Jindal is all resume and no substance. As much political charisma as a 10 day old bowl of curry. Always reminded me of the dweeb son of the local motel 6 owner. Another poser whose ambition far outruns his abilities. BTW is one of the most hated pols in Louisiana. His approvals are in the teens.</comment>

<comment>I live in  Louisiana.....I wouldn't vote for this clown if he ran for dog-catcher........he's been of the worst Guvs we've ever had.......enriching his cronies and cutting off services for the truly needy...those are his chief "accomplishments"......good- riddance........a truly unethical twerp......</comment>

<comment>Jindal may have flip-flopped on issues on a regular basis, but the one thing he never flipped on was massive tax cuts. even his own state legislature tried to get him to stop cutting because they were running out of programs to slash to fit their budget balancing.Where Jindal went wrong is when he sold his sold to Grover Norquist.</comment>

<comment>Since I'm not an anti-goverment voter Jindal lost my vote with his suggestion that the supreme court be eliminated as did Cruz with his "unelected lawyers" remark.  I gave neither one a pass because they might just have been pandering to the anti-whatever wing of the Republican party.I think a minimum qualification for consideration to be US president is an understanding of and mindset to work as part of the US government.  I feel that they (like other Republican "candidates") do not have that qualification.</comment>

<comment>Where did Bobby Jindal go wrong! Where did he go right? He wasn't going anywhere anyway, he was way out of his league as they all are. No real solutions they just blame Obama and Hillary and that's what passes for policy in their world.</comment>

<comment>He may be a policy wonk, I guess as long as you are dealing with hypotheticals and BS it all works., But in the real world, JIndal is extremely bad at executing, whatever he tried he seem to screw it up big time, some ideas were hare--brained to begin with, but others he just manage to get it wrong.That he thought himself as presidential material just confirm me that the man was a complete idiot.</comment>

<comment>Yep. Just now, on Tuesday morning.</comment>

<comment>It’s naive of him to think his Republican party would have a brown university-educated man as their leader.</comment>

<comment>How does that explain Ben Carson?</comment>

<comment>Bobby Jindal's problem?  He didn't take his own advice."We must stop being the stupid party."</comment>

<comment>He largely backed himself into the corner in Louisiana by actually doing what Republicans claim they want to do: He cut social welfare, education, and just about everything else that wasn't nailed down and refused to deal with taxation or the massive oil profits.  He was supposed to be a moderate Republican that completely failed and ended up being so disliked that it allowed John Bel Edwards to cruise to the Governorship.The Republicans do not have a winning formula anymore, their super-white base is aging out of the population and Bobby was trying to be 'new and improved' but got caught in the muck and mire of their current death spiral.</comment>

<comment>"The future once looked so bright."This is the false premise behind the title.  It looked bright in the same sense that Sarah Palin's once did, or Michelle Bachmann's, or any of the other puppies adopted by billionaires, politicians, or "opinion makers" with terminally bad judgement.  They didn't "go wrong."  They were exposed.</comment>

<comment>Unlike the others Jindahl had a working brain.</comment>

<comment>He is a smart guy who had to act like a stupid guy to be and be successful in what he himself once described as the stupid party.And instead of going off to a "Think Tank," he ought to try a "Reaction Tank" since this is all his party is capable of any more.</comment>

<comment>I was kind of thinking the same thing.I don't know how you can be a credible policy wonk when your adopted party celebrates and luxuriates in policies that have a tenuous grip on reality.</comment>

<comment>I think he quite adequately defined himself as an attention seeking idiot.</comment>

<comment>"Jindal’s failed White House bid was marked by his struggle to clearly define an identity as a candidate."After admonishing his party for being the party of stupid, he became stupid. He established a clear identity - a stupid person who could actually become president once trump and carson have disappeared.</comment>

<comment>Come on it started with his parents and something called the Womb. </comment>

<comment>Uh, no mention of anti-tax fanatic Grover Norquist and how Jindal basically handed over veto power to that unelected lobbyist regarding tax policy in Louisiana? Norquist grew up in the richest town in Massachusetts and has never, ever forgotten where he comes from and who "his" people are (hint: not people who are unable to afford to buy a house in Weston, MA).The reaction in Louisiana to this was remarkable as the state faced a fiscal crisis and outright fiscal hemorrhaging with Jindal as governor. White Republican state lawmakers in Louisiana--some of the most hardcore conservative, ultra-reactionary people in the country--begged Jindal to reconsider his pledging absolute fealty to Norquist. These white Republicans pointed out that breaking with Norquist did NOT mean somebody was a communist.</comment>

<comment>"'Is Bobby Jindal the GOP’s Obama?' Newsweek asked in 2008, shortly after Jindal was elected Louisiana’s governor."Therein lies one of the modern GOP's many, many problems: trying to play me-too with minority candidates to keep pace with the slowly but inexorably shifting demographics of the electorate, as though simply running someone with brown skin or a uterus will magically close the gap between them and the Democrats.Witness Sarah Palin in 2008, plucked from obscurity to demonstrate her own ignorance and shallowness on the national stage (though such qualities were somehow viewed as an asset by her many supporters, go figure) and Herman Cain in 2012, who was revealed to be not only a political neophyte possessing no knowledge whatsoever of the issues, but a man with a history of sexual harassment so long and persistent that Bill Clinton himself must have blushed.Now of course we have Dr. Ben Carson, another "outsider" who's shown himself to be completely unprepared for the office he seeks. He seems to view his own campaign as some sort of glorified book tour, which is how he came to prominence in conservative circles in the first place.Supporters have thus far stridently defended him against the "liberal media" gently pointing out that he's nothing more than a Christian fundamentalist with a history of shady business dealings and truly bizarre, often nakedly mendacious public statements, but I suspect that he'll eventually see the writing on the wall and drop out, just like Jindal and others have.Then his former supporters will divide themselves into three new camps: those still deluded enough to believe that he actually could have won and made a good President; those who, after a decent interval is observed, will actually admit to themselves and the rest of us that their supporting him was a huge mistake; and finally, those who will say "Ben who?" before quietly removing his campaign sign from their front yard and packing their copies of his books away in the garage, never to be seen again.</comment>

<comment>Well, duh!</comment>

<comment>The author calls Jindal a 'policy wonk' and claims his downfall was style over substance? This guy is all style and no substnace. This is a guy who has a degree in biology and apparently doesn't believe in the theory of evolution.  He's a clown of  the highest order.</comment>

<comment>He went wrong by being his uninspiring humorless self, and is therefore unelectable as a dubious human.  He has about a good a grip on all things Presidential as Dr. Carson.</comment>

<comment>Louisiana's version of Sarah Palin.</comment>

<comment>To quote William Shatner:[kind of]NEVER been.-r.c.</comment>

<comment>Often people behave in a manner opposite to what they say.  The most selfish people I know talk about how selfish others are.  People who complain about how hard they have to work are among the laziest people.  The toughest talker before a street fight is the one who runs.I hope that is the case with the commenters here.  A large proportion of  comments are vile, racist and hateful about a politician and any supporters he might have.  What is the point? To give skinheads ideas on what language to use?Is it not enough to say "I do not agree with Bobby Jindal, he did not catch on because his message is out of touch with the American people, and his track record is poor"? Why is it necessary to stomp him into the ground as the personification of all that is evil in the world?The Atlantic is a liberal publication that leans towards good writing instead of pictures.  Are the racist, intolerant commenters here representative of its readers?</comment>

<comment>You're projecting about the racism. Most of the folks who've mentioned it didn't slag Jindal for being Indian. They've expressed bemusement that an Indian got traction in a party that's hostile to minorities.</comment>

<comment>I see. If Republicans say they are opposed to an Obama policy, then they are racists.  If the people here say the foulest things imaginable about Jindal the person, as opposed to his policy views, and the tone is exactly the same as comments that might expressed by a skinhead, that is called "projecting".Republicans are not "hostile to minorities". You are projecting.</comment>

<comment>My dreams of entering Formula One with Dorothy's dirt cheap Maclaren cars have been dashed!  Time has run out. She won't tell me where she got the cars so Bernie Eccleston won't give Team Phranqlin a spot on the 2016 grid. And I had lined up my local organic kale outlet as a sponsor, too. Curse you, Dorothy!!!!!</comment>

<comment>If only his parents had moved to a Blue/Dem State... Bobby would be President by now. Instead, he had to be a fake right-winger in Louisiana.</comment>
