<comment>It just dawned on me that the main trouble with Obama is that he is like an indulgent father figure.  He wants to say "yes" to his favorite kids, no matter the message it might send them.He's kinda like Uncle Billy in Leave It to Beaver, where June Cleaver always hated to see him come over because as an adult, he ostensibly was responsible, but he was highly idiosyncratic and indulgent of his own whims/views, and what's more, he had no on-going responsibilities for his marginal actions.</comment>
