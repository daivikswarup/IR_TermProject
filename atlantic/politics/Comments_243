<comment>To me it almost feels like advertising (which I primarily think of when I think of Super PACs) can tear down a candidate, but they can't build up a sub-par one.  No amount of positive advertising was going to make the country love Jeb!, or make up for Rubio's mistakes, or make Cruz look like less of a creep.  That's not to say that SuperPAC advertising isn't worthwhile, it's just that it instead amplifies the flaws in the current crop of Republican candidates (ok, *all* of the candidates).</comment>

<comment>And advertising does not get the returns it used to. More and more Americans are watching TV in ways that allow them to skip commercials. They either record programs and watch them later or go to a service like Netflix.</comment>

<comment>My personal favourite - the MUTE button. :)</comment>

<comment>Yep. All other things being equal, having more money on their side helps candidates. On the other hand it may not save a terrible campaigner.</comment>

<comment>What mystery ?  They try to buy elections.</comment>

<comment>I think that's Frum's point. Some of the Super PACs look more like a scheme to enrich the people that run the SuperPAC than buy elections.</comment>

<comment>It seems to be his point. Agreed.   I just simplified it.</comment>

<comment>Jeb blew $150 million and all he got was an ass kicking from Trump.</comment>

<comment>That's the thing Jeb did not blew 150 Mil. Some SuperPAC raising money on Jeb's name spent 150 million, probably just pocketing must of the money.</comment>

<comment>Who knew a BDSM session could be so expensive.</comment>

<comment>I have a hard time feeling sorry for Republicans who believe they were scammed by a secretive, unregulated business masquerading as free speech.</comment>

<comment>They wanted Super PACs, and now they got 'em.</comment>

<comment>As far as I can see so far all those Super PACs have done is keep politicians in the race long past their "sell by" date. OTOH I think they are more influential on the state level.</comment>

<comment>Nobody in this article is asking you to feel sorry for anyone. It's not bribery. It's extortion. This is great stuff!</comment>

<comment>Meanwhile, you may have noticed that the only race where big money donors are really succeeding in buying their candidate victory is among the Democrats. Money isn't everything for the GOP (ask president Romney), but getting those Dem Super Pacs called "unions" on your side is a game changer on the other side.</comment>

<comment>That's the funny, but unintended consequence of Citizens United.Unions, and other organizations, have always supplied the votes and volunteers for a candidate.  With Citizens United, not only can unions supply the votes and volunteers -- they can now spend money on raising the volume on issues important to organized labor.</comment>

<comment>It's not an "unintended consequences" - the opinion is rife with references to unions; you can read it here:http://www.supremecourt.gov/op...</comment>

<comment>You think they weren't spending the money before? Union spending peaked in 2002 at over $90 million given to Democrats- candidates and the party- doesn't count their own issue spending. That was almost double what they spent just 10 years before -$50 million in 1992.https://www.opensecrets.org/in...</comment>

<comment>$90M seems like such quaint amount of money when the 2012 cycle saw over $1,000M in spending.I'm not sure that's the relevant chart.  Also with the bars nearly double for 2012  and 2014 I'm not sure how you're claiming that union spending peaked in 2002.FWIW, Open Secrets tracks outside spending:https://www.opensecrets.org/ou...Unions spent $23M in outside communications the  503(c) spent more than 10x, or $257M.</comment>

<comment>The link I gave was direct contributions to candidates and parties. The Teachers Union in California alone spends over $200 million to lobby for more pay (and taxes).</comment>

<comment>Its not the superpacs that are 'winning' the D primary.  The Clintons are deeply in the pocket of a number of well-heeled interests, those interests regard HRC as 'their girl' and will not support any other D's.  But the big thing is that anybody who endorses Sanders, anybody who fund-raises for Sanders can expect to find the Clintons and their (many) allies blacklisting them.</comment>

<comment>Maybe its just me, but Jeb Bush never really seemed to be in charge of his campaign . His strategy seemed to be raising money using his family name and connections.And then giving it to his campaign staff to "shock and Awe" his opponentsWhich is why I think that Bush lost. He had money.But little else going for him.   The only difference between  Jeb Bush and Jim Gilmore, was that Jeb bush had more famous relatives than Gilmore did.And Jeb bush had more money than Gilmore did.But in the end, money doesn't help if your campaign is lacking even a basic theme</comment>

<comment>Money remains the root of all evil.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. Women are the root of all evil.</comment>

<comment>If you're gonna try to pull out that old joke, at least get it right.Start with a couple of stand-bys, including a sexist one."Money is the root of all evil""Time is Money""Women equal time and money"Express them as mathematical equations.money = sqrt(evil)time = moneywomen = time * moneya little algebra gives uswomen = money^2 = ( sqrt(evil) )^2 = evilwomen = evilSo no.  Women are not the root of all evil.  They are just evil.Disclaimer This is a joke.  A bad one.</comment>

<comment>An old gold prospector said: I struck gold and made a fortune once; most of the money I spent on women and wine, the rest I wasted foolishly.</comment>

<comment>Trump was on Fox the other day bashing Karl Rove and Stephen Hayes. It's just too delicious.</comment>

<comment>They are some of his worst enemies. </comment>

<comment>I'm surprised Rove doesn't burst into flames when sunlight hits him.</comment>

<comment>It's funny to me--and I say this as someone who leans liberal--that the rise of super PACs was treated as if the democratic process had been sold to the highest bidder, and now we have an election where a self-financed billionaire has run rampant over the GOP establishment and a socialist from Vermont has, at the very least, put enough pressure on the near-inevitable Dem pick to force her leftward while people start to suspect the unregulated tool the Supreme Court essentially birthed is servicing its own corrupt ends rather than the corrupt ends it was intended for.</comment>

<comment>Yep, it appears that the inherent corruption of big money has prevented it from actually being all that effective.</comment>

<comment>Chickens come home to roost.  This is playing out just like their decades long reliance on bigotry and simple minded sloganeering.</comment>

<comment>I think a lot of that has to do with the amount of media attention the presidential election gets.  At the state legislative level, where people pay far less attention to what their state rep & state senator are doing, I do see politicians being bought by big money to vote against their districts.</comment>

<comment>So, in a way, super PACs are simply an economic redistribution program, taking money from the super wealthy and giving it to consultants and media?</comment>

<comment>It's trickle down economy as they say. The consultants are going to spend lavishly in expensive restaurants and buying themselves expensive cars. Also paying taxes.I love these super Pacs. Democracy seems a bit old fashioned. Why should a poor and a wealthy man have the same impact on election outcome ?</comment>

<comment>The DC and their 3 martini lunches/dinners with lobbyists and special interest groups basically allowed them to lose touch with the common man and what they feel- Trump and Bernie supporters. </comment>

<comment>Trump defeated the democrats, the media, the establishment republicans, the super pacs, and he did it on the cheap. The man's a genius.</comment>

<comment>Let's hold off on claiming victory over the Democrats until, I don't know, he is at least nominated by his own party...</comment>

<comment>I so hope you get to vote for him.</comment>

<comment>You do understand the Democrats see him as the easiest of the nominees to defeat?  His negatives are YUUUUGE.  http://www.gallup.com/opinion/...</comment>

<comment>That's what they say, but not what they believe. More trickery.</comment>

<comment>how did he defeat the democrats?  have we had the 2016 election already.how's that crystal ball?</comment>

<comment>We should clarify one thing: the super PACs refused to attack Trump because they made a strategic error, not because they were pursuing separate interests or had their own agenda. Bush, Rubio, Cruz, and Christie attacked one another because they all held a false believe that Trump would fade "naturally" and that second place would eventually be equivalent to first. It was a horrible miscalculation--one that I felt Rubio making in SC, where it seemed as if he clearly "needed" to finish ahead of Cruz, but in reality was simply setting the stage for a Trump steamroller. One of the dumbest set of also-rans in Presidential campaign history.Cruz and Rubio now desperately need a truce, and to gang up on Trump in the debate on Thursday, but it's probably too late for both of them.</comment>

<comment>Cruz's ego would never allow him to accept a partnership.  He couldn't handle sharing power with 99 other senators.  He wants too badly to be in charge.  And the R shot-callers hate Cruz MORE than Trump.</comment>

<comment>Couldn't the answer just be that political TV ads, similar to commercial TV ads, just aren't as effective anymore thanks to DVRs and essentially unlimited channel options?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I think that is true. But in product advertising, if the product does not live up to its billing, consumers don't keep buying it. The GOP is like that product that doesn't work as advertised. The voters are ready to try a new one.</comment>

<comment>I think social media is also undermining the power of TV ads.  Not just in the additional content for consumption, but the extent to which everyone is also playing the role of media producer.... recognizing how much a manufactured image can deviate from reality, even on your own Facebook page, let alone a professionally produced ad.  I think that is what is attracting people to the raw, unpolished Trump, and Sanders also.</comment>

<comment>I have copyrighted the word SuperPACMAN to describe a candidate who receives money from a SuperPAC. Any use of the word SuperPACMAN without the express written consent of thebeerdude is expressly prohibited. I am also creating a new video game with the same name.</comment>

<comment>la-di-dah!</comment>

<comment>SuperPACMAN</comment>

<comment>Strikes me that super PAC dollars need to be considered in proportion to the overall value of the media market--both paid and free.  While $150MM is a lot all by itself, it's not as significant in the context of the overall value of the media coverage of the primaries.Super PACs won't go away, they'll just migrate to smaller elections where they're not competing with so much free media, like buying pro-(fill in the blank) judges and politicians.</comment>

<comment>Trump supporters hate the other candidates.Trump supporters hate the other candidates supporters.Trump supporters want the people they hate to vote for Trump.yeah ..... ok</comment>

<comment>Please tell Amity Schlaes, a neocon dame who wrote an adulatory biography of Coolidge, whom she admires for being pro-business.  Most unbiased historians agree that he was only a so-so president and did pave the way for the Great Depression by disdaining regulation.</comment>

<comment>This election is so full of unintended consequences, it should be call the "chickens come home" election</comment>

<comment>I was reading an article on Politico the other day about how Sheldon Adelson had barely donated any money in this campaign, and wondering about the reasons. I thought, maybe this self-made gazillionaire isn't a moron, whatever else he may be. Maybe he noticed that, for all the money he spent last time around, Newt Gingrich didn't even sniff the presidency. That said, unlimited spending in presidential contests isn't the real story. It matters much more on the local level, where we've seen unprecendented amounts spent on congressional, gubernatorial and senatorial elections. Maybe you can't buy the presidency, but you can buy a hell of a lot of congressmen.</comment>

<comment>This is true, but we can push back.  An ad doesn't have much credibility.  In marketing, word of mouth is far, far more valuable than purchased advertising.  We can reclaim our democracy.  Debunk false advertising.  Focus on positions and specific ideas over happy talk.  Engage your representatives.  It would be RIDICULOUSLY easy to start a local political blog where you discussed issues of the day.  Even if you were coo-coo for cocoapuffs partisan, you could become a factor in your party's politics very easily.As Dylan said, the times they are a' changin'.</comment>

<comment>Why make these sellout media owners wealthy from wasted site advertising when it just goes to lying to their viewers. Somebody is influencing and subsidizing these Identity Politics phony wars. People let themselves be duped so often. I used to be very naive to these problems. </comment>

<comment>We are wired for tribalism.  Whether its my faith vs. your faith, jingoism, or even stupid sports boosterism.  We fall into us/them paradigms far too easily.  The first step is recognizing it, stepping back, and trying to genuinely engage the other person, instead of bludgeoning them into your way of thinking.  I don't much care for Trump, but D's need to acknowledge that middle class economics have grown more precarious and will grow more precarious still.  They need to make a case for bringing in millions of low-wage workers.  I doesn't matter if they are Mexican, Syrian, or Martian.  Its not good for the bottom half of our economy and all the accusations of racism in the world won't change that.</comment>

<comment>Dems want more dem voters and less White people. Nothing is about  economically fiscal responsibility for them. I say we all just become immune to  being called Racist. Hold our ground on what's the Right thing to do and eventually it will quit working. Like a child throwing a tantrum. Ignore and they stop. </comment>

<comment>When you have Trump and Anne Coulter claiming Mexicans are murderers and rapists, that racist shoe fits pretty well.  The D's who are voting for more streamlined immigration aren't doing it for long term party growth. They are doing it out of empathy.   Make a case that low-skill labor is a zero sum game and the home countries need their most motivated people to grow and prosper.  It would also help if somebody recognized some of these people are fleeing the shooting galleries we created with our drug policies.</comment>

<comment>We are not the world's savior. We could take in people everywhere. I'm not buying any of this fiscally irresponsible empathy. Imagine if they were White people. The Establishment want cheap labor via importing low-skill and global investment. Have you seen the billions we spend in public assistance for these people - education, police & gvmt regulations, Earned Income credits/welfare. They take a lot of their $ under the table and send it back home to their families- without paying income taxes. I see it 1st hand in my job.It's a Win/Win for future voters and investors' cheap labor, but bad for the US. jobs.</comment>

<comment>I am glad that I got a good public education.  In high school we did an extended lesson and presentation on advertising.  The subliminal message advertising that was in use before being made illegal was disturbing.  I had good teachers and a curriculum that made you think.  (I am now 56 BTW)</comment>

<comment>Will you vote for Trump if Cruz fails to get the nomination?</comment>

<comment>It's a beautiful day in America!</comment>

<comment>Yet, not a word in this article about super Pac's on the left.  Not one.</comment>

<comment>Mainly, I suppose, because they're about 10x smaller than the GOP SuperPACs: by comparison, liberal SuperPACs are a drop in the bucket.Follow the money: the article's point is that the people running the SuperPACs have their hand in the till. They're not stupid, so they line up at the GOP money trough.</comment>

<comment>Well, Mr. Frum is a conservative. Maybe he doesn't care about lefty superpacs.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry.  I read this article with a mind set that it applied to all politicians at all levels.  :)</comment>

<comment>Well David, you made some interesting, good points; however, the Super PAC bastard child is mostly a creature of the Republican party's creation (mostly).</comment>

<comment>Excellent article.  Exposes the sham of PAC's not "coordinating" with campaigns. Though you should have included all of David Brock's Hillary Super PACS and the millions in personal wealth he has accrued.</comment>

<comment>Actually I think the chaos this describes is proof that they aren't coordinating - or at least they are coordinating very badly.</comment>

<comment>With all the publicity about highly ideological billionaires manipulating the system, it's easy to forget that most superpacs are really extortion rackets.</comment>

<comment>Yes, unlike the article states, the coercive behavior attributed to super-PACs is best described as extortion and not black-mail.</comment>

<comment>Extortion is blackmail.</comment>

<comment>Do you mean to suggest that the terms extortion and blackmail are equivalent or that extortion is a subset of blackmail?</comment>

<comment>I saw Frumpkins dancing in the streets.</comment>

<comment>This article is true,  but the presidency is too high profile to hoodwink people with ads, especially when the establishment candidates are diametrically opposed to the base on things like immigration.But for members of congress or state legislatures, the money is probably well spent.Now its time for the Dem base to kick over the sh**can in regards to unlimited Free Trade. Pushed by the elites, but helps the top 20%, everyone else eats globalization dust.</comment>

<comment>Money does buy elections and always has. That does not mean that whoever has the most money always wins. Money is not sufficient but it is a requisite: without a lot of money you cannot even get to the stage where you may be considered a possible candidate.</comment>

<comment>I've been thinking about this for a few years.  With the rise of social media, how much value is there to massive ad buys for a 30 second commercial?  A negative spot can be debunked in twenty-four hours.  Primaries are particularly susceptible to this.  The respective propaganda machines have gotten too good at their jobs, and people from opposing viewpoints can't sway each other very well.  But people of similar ideologies can talk to each other VERY well on social media, and that means social media has a profound impact on primary races.</comment>

<comment>The Internet is reversing the trend created by 1990s media. In the 90s, media was more consolidated and unified, and so the parties got closer and closer to each other. Today, it's much easier to move into bubbles where you don't hear any of the same things that people on the other side hear. So the parties are getting farther and farther apart.</comment>

<comment>Isn't greed a wonderfully consistent motivation?</comment>

<comment>Not all politics is presidential... This big money is still having a big impact in down-ticket races.</comment>

<comment>Jeb Bush was hobbled by a huge cannonball chained to his ankle. On the cannonball it says: GEORGE W. BUSH.</comment>

<comment>That was only one ankle.  There was a cannonball on the other ankle which said Terri Schiavo.Funny thing about the Bushes: they think they're more infallible than the Pope.  When George was asked what mistakes he'd made as president, he couldn't name any.  And Jeb still says he was justified in butting into Michael Schiavo's business.</comment>

<comment>George W's way of admitting failure was: "If you don't agree with what I am doing, it is because I am guilty of not explaining it clearly enough to you. I apologize for that and I will try to explain it better again."</comment>

<comment>Rick OsheaIve never bought that conventional wisdom . George W Bush may be very unpopular with Democrats.But  not with Republican Primary voters. Jeb Bush's main problem was that his last name was the only thing that he had going for him. There are a couple of hundred living  ex Governors . And 50 sitting Governors at the moment. And quite a few of them are more qualified  to be President ,than Jeb Bush is .Scott Walker appealed to Republicans   that didn't like public sector unions.Rubio appeals to Republicans that want a young fresh face. Cruz appeals to Republicans that don't like to compromise.Trump appeals to Republicans who want a "strongman / reality tv star" in the White House. Kasich appeals to Republicans[like myself] who are fisicaly     conservativeBut who did Jeb Bush ever appeal to? Other than his apparent belief that it was   his turn to be President and that he could buy it with  his "shock and awe" money?  And that attitude    just ended up annoying peopleBeing George W Bush's brother didn't hurt Jeb Bush.It was the only advantage that he had. If his last name had ben something other than Bush, he would have gotten as much news coverage as Jim Gilmore</comment>

<comment>I think you have a point there. I was thinking more in terms of general election than primaries. I am sure G.W. did hurt him to some extent though, even in the primaries. Perhaps primary voters might be thinking of his chances in the general election? Or a conscious or subconscious aversion to having three presidents from the same family within one generation? Just a thought.</comment>

<comment>Your link to opensecrets.org is broken. It goes to "secrets.org" which is totally unrelated to this story.</comment>

<comment>We have over-saturated the market for shitty campaign ads.  They're gonna need to start getting more creative.</comment>

<comment>Maybe make more with former porn stars!</comment>

<comment>The fact that supply-side tax cuts were the crown jewel of all 16 Republican candidates suggests that money still matters in politics.   Political advertising also still helps at the margins which is where most campaigns are won or lost.</comment>

<comment>Is this asking me to feel bad for large donors to super pacs? Let me think. . . . nope, I feel nothing. We need publicly funded elections. Period.</comment>

<comment>Given what we already know about how readily campaigns trample all over the supposed ban on coordinating with their SuperPACs, it's hard not to blame Jeb Bush for the missteps of Right to Rise. We'd have to believe that he and his top campaign staff had no way to express their displeasure with Right to Rise and were completely unable or unwilling to let the SuperPAC know what it should be doing instead. Well that or we'd have to think that Right to Rise simply ignored what the Bush campaign told them to do. Either way, I don't buy it.</comment>

<comment>There were incompetent campaigns long before their were super pacs.</comment>

<comment>The age of the superpac is the most brazen and clear use of bribes and corruptions to buy elections in the history of this country. Special interest groups and lobbyists have done more damage to this country than any "terrorist" group ever has.</comment>

<comment>Except that the are not buying the election.  The superpacs are spending billions on candidates like Bush and are getting their a$$es kicked.  </comment>

<comment>The only reason Bush didn't win is because his brother was George W. That and d-bags like Trump and the people he sold his rear end to are funding the opposition.</comment>

<comment>So what's Chris Christy's excuse?  And all the other superpac funded Republicans who have dropped out?</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie was not raking in anywhere near Hillary or Jeb money. Plus that fat slob knew he never really stood a chance. He just wanted attention and a way to funnel money into his own coffers. Same goes for the rest of the clown show.</comment>

<comment>Christie, Jindal, Brownback, Snyder, Walker, McCrory, Scott--all those GOP governors have made a mess of their states.  I hope they leave office and sink back into the corrupt cesspools they came from.</comment>

<comment>Add Jerry Brown to that list...smh</comment>

<comment>and Dannel Malloy of Connecticut.  Or Jay Jay Inslee in Washington state.</comment>

<comment>What is the color of the sky on your world?</comment>

<comment>The only reason Bush was even in the race was George W. and his dad. Nobody would have cared about him otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, the corrupt lobbyists and special interest groups that own DC want someone who is willing to play ball (Hillary, Jeb, etc).  I bet most of that superpac money and campaign fundraising is going to magically find its way in their "pockets" when its all said and done.</comment>

<comment>Trump is defeating the Super PACs one state at a time. :)</comment>

<comment>That's like hearing that Assad is beating ISIS.</comment>

<comment>It's Alien vs. Predator: "Whoever wins...we lose."</comment>

<comment>I think Trump is a blight on American politics, but I love your avatar.</comment>

<comment>The concern with the dark money also extends to state and congressional races, Mr. Frum. It is there that rich corrupt oligarchs/plutarchs are actively buying political power.</comment>

<comment>That's the assumption and I'm sure there's an element of truth to it but it's appearing to be not as true as we feared.  We have local campaigns lately where a candidate has been badly hurt for taking outside money.  Bernie's certainly used large donations to Hillary against her to good effect and Jeb donors can't help but feel ripped off.  Not saying they should get sympathy, just checking my old assumptions.  They're not holding up very well and I'm delighted.</comment>

<comment>Gotta say, I don't think Citizens United will turn out to be the disaster we all predicted. The assumption was that tons of money would flow into the existing power framework. But really it might have broken down the framework. If you have enough sugardaddies, no one with that kind of money really has that much power. Money becomes a side issue when it can buy so little.</comment>

<comment>As Willy Sutton said "I rob banks because that's where the money is."  Mike Murphy can now say "I rob nitwit candidates with a large donor list because that is where the money is.</comment>

<comment>nice burn :)</comment>

<comment>A good and interesting article, but it ignores what the dark money has done in downticket races. Dark money installed the Tea Party government of North Carolina that has been attempting to drive the state to the right and marginalize the Research Triangle.There's much better uses for donors' political money at the state level. This also appears to be the one election where no political rules apply. </comment>

<comment>"Here's a vast pool of untrackable political money. But don't worry, it's being funneled through a bunch of unaccountable sleazy bagmen!"Yes, that makes me feel much better, thanks.</comment>

<comment>huge $ in elections directs the conversation. it determines who the candidates are (i.e. unless you can raise a lot of money, you can't get coverage) and what they stand for (mostly the status quo, b/c that's what their funders, the elite/corporations want).</comment>

<comment>You are still on this.  Which Republican candidate spent the least of the major candidates?  That's right, Trump.  Money does not equal success, wake up.</comment>

<comment>Super PAC's don't bother me. People with too much money throwing it away to the grifters who are campaign professionals. It's a perfect marriage. What does bother me is the amount of time politicians spend raising money to throw at the grifters. This is a problem.</comment>

<comment>Had to Google to find out what a "bundler" was.If you have 100 million to donate to a political cause then hit that person/corporation with an tax deductible luxury tax (access fee?).  They must also contribute 100 million dollars to fund a homeless shelter, fix up a school, provide drinkable water, open a soup kitchen, fund a free health clinic etc.  Do it out in the open.  Post it online.  Let the rich person put their name on the new library - good for business.  Get rid of the PACS.</comment>

<comment>Actually the Webster's defines Bundler as : The next ambassador to the Bahamas.</comment>

<comment>Had to Google to find out what a Bahamas "Bundler" is/was.Thanks for the :) :0  (I am giggling)</comment>

<comment>So in other words the liberal hysteria over UNLIMITED!!!!!!   SPENDING!!!!!! IN!!!!!! FEDERAL!!!!!!!!! ELECTIONS!!!!!!!!  was just that.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans and most Democrats were all in for paying big big bucks to bank CEOs. And the CEOs performed very poorly. Same thing seems to be happening with the PACS. But the good news is that this time around there is no federal government to bail out the PACs. But notwithstanding the limited success of the PACs this time around, their existence creates huge barriers to entry. They make politics less democratic and less diverse. Democracy succeeds precisely because it facilitates diversity.</comment>

<comment>"In 1996, Kerry faced a difficult re-election fight against Governor William Weld, a popular Republican incumbent who had been re-elected in 1994 with 71% of the vote. The race was covered nationwide as one of the most closely watched Senate races that year. Kerry and Weld held several debates and negotiated a campaign spending cap of $6.9 million at Kerry's Beacon Hill townhouse. Both candidates spent more than the cap, with each camp accusing the other of being first to break the agreement.[88] During the campaign, Kerry spoke briefly at the 1996 Democratic National Convention. Kerry won re-election with 53 percent to Weld's 45 percent".  (Wiki - John Kerry)Too bad this idea didn't work.</comment>

<comment>So Democrats don't have SuperPACs?</comment>

<comment>So, it's time for the Supreme Court to strike down limits on contributions to campaigns. Bypass superpacs, problem solved. Oh, wait, there's a vacancy on the Supreme Court. We must elect a Republican president, who will nominate the right justice to do the job.You've been warned.</comment>

<comment>The author, David Frum, is a neocon who concocted the "axis of evil" line that Junior Bush used to take the US to war based on falsehoods, half-truths and outright lies.  He should be deported back to his native Canada.It is not at all surprising that a creep like this should try to downplay and minimize the dangerous and undemocratic aspects of Super-PAC's and campaign contributions in general.Without money in politics, the special interests would lose their mechanism for exerting influence on lawmakers.  Frum is an Israel-firster who is defending Israel's "right" to bribe US lawmakers... not much more to it than that.</comment>

<comment>Super PACs have more impact at state and local levels where money can move votes more efficiently. A Walker or a Brownback or a Scott, can cause a lot of damage.Secondly, even if Super PAC's can change just one outcome from what voters prefer, that is too much. As we know, having a Bush vs. a Gore does matter.</comment>

<comment>The states are more corrupt than the feds, that's a given.Here's what happened in the Empire State:Sheldon "Shelly" Silver (born February 13, 1944) is an American lawyer and Democratic Party politician from New York, who rose to become Speaker of the New York State Assembly in 1994. On January 30, 2015, eight days after his arrest on federal corruption charges, Silver submitted his resignation as Speaker, effective February 2, in order to defend himself against the charges. On November 30, Silver was found guilty on all counts and was removed by law from his position as a member of the Assembly. (source: Wiki)New York is not alone; every state has a corruption issue.</comment>

<comment>Agree. NJ (Christie), Virginia (McDonnell), Florida (Scott), Maine, Kansas, Minnesota, North Carolina, Alabama, etc., are all corrupt.</comment>
