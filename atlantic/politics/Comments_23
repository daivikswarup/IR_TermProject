<comment>Funny how it's called the "Democrat" party - but the massive number of superdelegates ( going to Hillary ) rigs the game so that what the voters do doesn't really matter.</comment>

<comment>The DNC and this dog and pony show is pathetic. The BERN hasn't a chance in He*ll of getting that nomination.</comment>

<comment>If the superdelegates steal Bernie's win and hand it to Hillary- are the actual Dem voters going to bend over and pass the vaseline?</comment>

<comment>HILDEBEAST'S drones are going to vote for her no matter what. That is a given.  The DNC, Donna Brazille and the cabal of women in the Party , and the CLINTONS, are not going to let anyone, ANY ONE.....get that nomination but the HILDEBEAST.  These are the CLINTONS. They feel they are OWED this, and they intend to get it.</comment>
