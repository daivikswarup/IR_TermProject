<comment>I think Bernie Sanders is resonating because he's Trump's tell-it-like-it-is counterpart on the other side, only the more he speaks, the more it is evident he is being entirely truthful and also doesn't appear to be in it for his ego, which is why I think he could beat Trump head-on, whose tell-it-like-it-is is just a laundry list of cynicism, doom & gloom, while he appears to be in it solely for ego. If you're a hard-working person just trying to get by, it is clear that Bernie is the truest candidate for your interests. He isn't bought off by anybody and is primarily looking to benefit you after more than 3 decades now where Washington always defaults to putting their corporate slavers first.</comment>

<comment>Hear hear!!  Plus Clinton is very boring.</comment>

<comment>and with a strong connection with wall street</comment>

<comment>Clinton doesn't generate any enthusiasm AT ALL.</comment>

<comment>Jeb! with a pantsuit and the same list of donors.  </comment>

<comment>Hillary not only voted for W's Iraq War Resolution of 2002;She didn't bother to read the National Intelligence Estimate;She didn't bother asking Sen. Bob Graham (D), chair of senate intelligence committee, and;Ignored Ambassador Charles Freeman's (Obama's nominee to be Director of National Intelligence) public warnings in 2002 that W had meetings planning the invasion of Iraq prior to 911 (later confirmed by Sec. of Treasury, Paul O'Neil).Hillary then championed the illegal invasion of Libya and has always said Assad must go (without giving any reasons) and advocated for invading Syria.As Secretary of State, Hillary hired Victoria Nuland, Dick Cheney's foreign policy adviser, as an undersecretary of state!The woman is incapable of learning - at least when it involves other parents' children being killed.http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_...</comment>

<comment>She is however, pretty good a raising money (taking bribes) and dodging questions.</comment>

<comment>And the FBI is unto that !!!</comment>

<comment>Like the majority of politicians.</comment>

<comment>I'll take boring, thanks. I don't care if my airline pilot or my brain surgeon is boring, I just want them to know exactly what they're doing. Hillary is a much better choice for getting things done, even if she doesn't rock the soaring rhetoric. "We need every child to have a free college education!" sounds great. But can he do it? No.</comment>

<comment>I agree except for the last sentence. We can, if not eliminate the cost of post secondary education, at least reduce it.Anyone with the drive can do it.</comment>

<comment>Well, now...it isn't that simple. "Anyone" would include Obama if he had a sympathetic Congress and an American populace willing to scream when the filibuster is improperly wielded.</comment>

<comment>At the very least, we can change the way it is financed so that it isn't the burden that it is right now.  Also, if we structure the finance in the right manner, we can help control the cost of post-secondary education.</comment>

<comment>The way I see it, if banks can get interest-free loans from the government, there should be no reason why students can't do the same. (Provided they finish their education, of course.)</comment>

<comment>I don't think it's the interest that's the problem, necessarily.  It's the nature of the repayment.  As a government program, it could be structured so that it is an extra payroll deduction that kicks in when you begin making say, 300% of the poverty line.The problem with student loans isn't that some makes money on them- it's that they don't easily adjust to hard times, and they trash your credit, which makes everything else harder.</comment>

<comment>Why not just steal the money from evil rich people and give it to students.  That way, they won't even have to bother going to college.</comment>

<comment>we are talking of stealing any money from anyone.  we are, with benjamin franklin, saying that when needed everyone must pay their portion of the cost of civil society.you likely know that but are too lazy to actually develop a real argument, so you grab for a stereotype.</comment>

<comment>So, civil society is making me, Jo Taxpayer,  pay for someone else's college education?</comment>

<comment>When we buy tanks the Pentagon doesn't want, have a bunch of wars, or give subsidies to the most profitable businesses in the world, "Jo Taxpayer" doesn't mind at all, but when we dare doing anything for the non-rich, that's horrible! You know, the rich will ship your job overseas at their discretion no matter how much you kiss their derriere and worship them.</comment>

<comment>Yea, my Republican cronies and  I just put in a huge order for unwanted tanks so the publicly held corporation that builds them can make higher dividend payments to their largest shareholders, the municipal employee union pension funds.  You do know that you are a useful idiot (commie wannabe moron).</comment>

<comment>> my Republican cronies and I just put in a huge order for unwanted tanks ...http://www.foxnews.com/politic...I know, I used the biggest bastion of libtardness, Fox. I think you were doubting what I said, but your statement was so full of snark and nothing else, it's hard to know exactly where you were getting at.  Maybe quit gulping the haterade and try and have a real point. Show us you have at least a room temperature IQ.>  You do know that you are a useful idiotWell it's better than a useless one.  Writing an extended and empty snarky rant just makes you look about as stupid when you parrot wingnut talking points. I wish you were at least a little bit smarter so you'd know how stupid you are.</comment>

<comment>Did you miss the words "bipartisan support".  PS  Generals are not always right.</comment>

<comment>> PS Generals are not always right.And neither are you obviously. Enjoy your crow.</comment>

<comment>I could hardly pay for my own college education, but some how I did it and I had no assets!!So can you.</comment>

<comment>Hey, I already paid full price for mine and my kids.  Now , thanks to Hillary or Bernie I will be paying for some stranger's kid to go to college on my dime.  That's fair.</comment>

<comment>http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/...Or maybe they could be charged more</comment>

<comment>that debate was settled really about 2 centuries ago when thomas jefferson proposed free education as necessary to the needs of the society.  at that time the needs were for just a few years of elementary schooling.  now the needs of society is for advanced education.but of course.  society must pay to accomplish its goals.  not everything can be left for the tooth fairy or the invisible hand to handle.</comment>

<comment>That is why he was the fist Secretary of Education in the Bizarro Administration. There was never serious talk of the Federal Government being involved in public education.  You are an idiot.</comment>

<comment>idiot</comment>

<comment>Are you one of the "evil" rich people you talk about? If not, then STFU.If so, then stop being so f'king greedy and pay your fair share in taxes to support an infrastructure you've benefited greatly from.I will be taxed more under Bernie's tax plan and am very happy to do so, knowing my money will help educate Americas youth and insure a prosperous future for my country, instead of paying for wars that kill women and children and devastate entire societies.</comment>

<comment>I'm one of those 'evil rich people' he talks about. I know for a fact that he's economically illiterate, and some of my friends would consider him a 'useful idiot'.</comment>

<comment>Yea, I am an evil rich person, and YOU know nothing about taxes.  School taxes are paid from property taxes, not FIT.  America has the most progressive Federal Tax structure in the world.  Also, the Federal government spending on infrastructure is a tiny fraction of what is spent on welfare and transfer payments.   Want to know why you are not rich?  Its because you are stupid, and Sanders can't fix that!</comment>

<comment>So, Mr. rich guy, did you get that way from reading only parts of books, because you missed a major part of my comment where i stated "my taxes will go up under Bernie", and the reason is because I do very well.In fact, in the last three years I've accumulated more wealth than all the 15 years prior, and was taxed roughly 18% capital gains. Meanwhile the guy who takes care of my yard is paying upwards of 30%.There's a major difference between you and I qaz, I was nurtured by loving parents, therefore I don't pocess phychopathic tendencies that make me believe  I'm better and more deserving than everyone else. I insist on paying my fair share in taxes to support my community, because I know what I'll get in return will be ten times better than what money can buy.Greed is an unforgivable attribute and will only create a lonely reality.Oh, one more thing Mr Simpleton, schools are only partially paid for with property taxes. But hey, don't let facts get in the way of your disgust for mankind.</comment>

<comment>I doubt your lawn boy make over $150,000 (assuming a joint return) or you even  know what a capital gain is and how they are taxed.  Schools are primarily funded by property taxes, some states help poor communities and very little is from the federal government.  Pretending you now something about taxes makes you look very foolish and immature.</comment>

<comment>Why not just straw man the shit out of someone rather than making an actual argument?  Oh wait.</comment>

<comment>It is not "straw" when you idiots pass confiscatory taxes.</comment>

<comment>So, you basically only have straw men and ad hominem.  Good for you =)</comment>

<comment>Unless money isn't the reason they go to college to begin with -- and it shouldn't be.</comment>

<comment>Well dumbass, it should be.  Spending $200,000 to study art history is insane, unless your parents are multi millionaires and are going to foot the bills..</comment>

<comment>Instead of interest free loans, I would prefer to see lower tuition and more forgivable loans.</comment>

<comment>Good idea, that way a student can major in Art History and not worry about getting a job to pay the loan back.  Also, the government should force museums to give people free art.Am I missing something here?  Doesn't the word "loan" imply a repayment obligation and reasonable interest?  (See my comment about stealing money from the evil rich.)</comment>

<comment>Banks get interest-free loans from the government? Do tell me more!</comment>

<comment>Yes, loaning money with out interest to students will surely bring down the cost of college.   Maybe idiots like you will then be able to afford to take an economics course.</comment>

<comment>i would be happy to take one with you.  perhaps you would grow beyond your economic talking points from the right wing think tanks.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the ad hominem.  It really adds to the discussion.In any case, try a bit harder to follow the discussion.  I wasn't proposing interest-free loans.  Further, in the system I had proposed, there would be ample opportunities to build in price controls.</comment>

<comment>Right, I reread our posts, you thought it more appropriate to forgive principle defaults, not interest ("and more forgivable loans")  Here comes another ad hominem regarding price controls.....Socialist idiot!  They don't work and never have.</comment>

<comment>the education benefit given to the world war ii veterans gave us the largest educated population in the world and contributed to the growth of the u.s. economy between 1950 and 1970.of course they work.</comment>

<comment>You should get a ruler out so you can read line-by-line.  I didn't say anything about 'more forgivable loans', either.Also, perhaps you should ask me about price controls before calling me an idiot.The reason college has exploded in cost is the extreme increase in demand for seats, and our seeming unlimited willingness to finance it.  The way to counteract that is to offer a better deal in regard to finance in exchange for accepting a more limited amount of funding.Also, high schools should have a larger role in educating students regarding what comes after high school.  Too many don't have a clue what they're getting in to until they're hip-deep in debt.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, it was the idiot Mr. Fusion that said "more forgivable".  You are still an idiot however, the federal government has absolutely no business in financing higher education.</comment>

<comment>I know, you already got yours, so screw everyone else.  Not an uncommon opinion.Sadly, it's more likely we go down your path than not.  It's cool though- when the jails are too full to take the next wave of people that can't make it in the (lack of a functioning) system we've created, you can take some of that tax money you've saved an spend it on the private security force you'll need to keep you and your family safe.Me, I'm just going to keep on arguing in favor of a more equitable society, so as to avoid the Mad Max end game your path will likely end in.</comment>

<comment>Hahah durrr</comment>

<comment>If you have not been to college, just admit.  Take a walk through any University today, and enjoy all their Atriums, six swimming pools, palatial Administration buildings over staffed with liberal tenured lefties, and then you will see a reason tuition has gone through the glass, prism like, ceiling.</comment>

<comment>I don't disagree.  The reason that is, though, is because of the ease of financing education, along with a lack of prior education regarding exactly what all that borrowing means.It's the same thing we saw during the housing boom, but worse, in a way.  Who cares how big the house is?  We're not paying for it in 'real' money anyways!</comment>

<comment>No amount of education could convince (most) children not to borrow to fund college.It's a matter of experience. They don't have experience dealing with a large amount of debt. It's one thing to be told that you'll by paying 400$/mo for 15 years to pay it off, it's another to try to live that way on a 1200$ salary.</comment>

<comment>It's not that you shouldn't borrow for college- it's that you should borrow as little as possible, and that, if you have to borrow, you should try and pick a field that gives you a chance at paying it back.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but they don't have any experience dealing with long-term self denial either:D</comment>

<comment>Are you suggesting college Presidents and professors take pay cuts.  I am with you on that, comrade.</comment>

<comment>Let Europe take care of it's own defense budget. We have over 600 military installations around the world. How much does that cost? Could that money be better spent on our own?</comment>

<comment>Oaaaath, easily save hundreds of billions.</comment>

<comment>YES HE CAN. Hillary gets nothing done except more gmo's & fracking.</comment>

<comment>She raised 2 billion dollars, slough that off you Sanders loser.</comment>

<comment>In other words you're sticking with Clinton out of indignation at this point. Try not to be so conservative in the general.</comment>

<comment>According to what measures have you decided that Clinton is more competent than Sanders? A statement devoid of any qualifiers, such as the one you've made above, has little to no persuasive power to anyone skeptical of your position, and really just makes you come across as some starry-eyed fanboy. </comment>

<comment>Read through the comments here and actual qualifiers by either side are pretty scarce.And I prefer Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Sadly, I'm starting to find my fellow Sanders supporters' rhetoric to be quite lacking in substance. </comment>

<comment>I'll make it easy for you idiots.Sanders: Hard left socialist promising a ton of free stuff he can't deliver.Hillary: Hard left socialist promising a ton of free stuff she can't deliver. She is a liar and a crook, with a pervert husband.So Democrats, MAKE YOUR CHOICE!</comment>

<comment>sez the hard right commentator who can't see the political score board their so far in right field.</comment>

<comment>Make my day, vote for Commie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Provide evidence that he is a member of the Communist Party or retract your ridiculous charge.  I thought Joe McCarthy died in 1957.</comment>

<comment>can't vote for a mythical figure of your imagination. sorry.it is possible for me to vote for the real person, the democratic socialist, bernie sanders.  would that still make your day?only want to help.</comment>

<comment>Don't tempt me to find such a guy!   If ever anyone needed five years in a re-education camp,  it's you. </comment>

<comment>Holy f*ck are you full of sh*t. You HAVE to be a kid trolling. Only a kid can be so short sighted. I hope you're not as much of a fa**ot as* adult as you come off, being. You are bad, people like you are bad, and you are all dying off. You wouldn't know that because you as*holes never come out of your communities to see the real world. Just huff and puff like a kid having a temper tantrum. Go f*ck yourself.</comment>

<comment>What free stuff is sanders promising, and that he won't be able to deliver on? Why won't he be able to?</comment>

<comment>You would support a conniving and devious woman such as HC???  I hope you are kidding!!!</comment>

<comment>someone whose only option is her or one of the clowns in the republican debates.</comment>

<comment>Yep, they are all clowns.  Think much Bozo?</comment>

<comment>yes.  they are all clowns.  cruz the outsider who has always had an insider job.  jeb who is trying to fight his way out of the bag of his family name.  rubio who is trying to square the circle of wanting immigration reform but has a fear of speaking honestly to the republican voter.  oh, and trump, the clown in chief.good lord i love this campaign.</comment>

<comment>Good lord, you don't know when people are goofing on you for being an idiot.</comment>

<comment>there is no distinction in your comments between your goofing and your goofing.  you are consistent.</comment>

<comment>I want my airline pilot or brain surgeon to do what's best for me though, not what's best for the owners of the airline or hospital.</comment>

<comment>Kind of like when Hillary was laughed out of Congress when she proposed the US switch to socialized medicine.</comment>

<comment>only in your mind can a insurance concept based on private enterprise be considered socialized.</comment>

<comment>Look it up junior, this happened when she was Bill's "Vice President"  Not the Obama care shell game.</comment>

<comment>i quite remember it.  you need to look it up.  it was not a single payers system.  it was a system based on the participation of the private sector.and the shell game was the republican alternative to the affordable care act.</comment>

<comment>That's the easiest of his policies to get done. The tax to pay for if only applies to Wall Street speculators. Are you on their side?</comment>

<comment>That's nice for people who can afford a surgeon or an airline ticket. That's exactly the kind of thing a lot of us are priced out of.The question is whether we get someone who shows a desperate willingness to help us or someone (ie. Clinton) satisfied with boring "business as usual" politics that will let those of us who are drowning continue to drown.For you, boring is satisfactory. For people who are sinking, boring is DEADLY.</comment>

<comment>#BernieSanders has said how he will pay for his education proposal: a tiny Wall Street transaction tax. This will also help strengthen the market. Computers making thousands of trades per minute to try to squeeze $ from the market is absurd and sometimes rekless.</comment>

<comment>High-frequency trading is a house-always wins scam that has nothing to do with genuine free markets, but an effort to tax it would be spun as the heavy, grasping hand of bureaucratic government interfering with plucky high-tech entrepreneurship that they don't understand.  Sanders would be the right person to deflate this and educate the public if anyone could.</comment>

<comment>MSM and Wall St has spent billions on propaganda to make you think that way.Enthusiasm wins elections, of which Trump has lots and Hillary has none. But you know who has more enthusiasm behind them than Hillary or Trump? That's correct. Bernie Sanders does.A vote for Hillary in the primaries is a vote for Trump in the general, as she can not and will not win a national election. Americans on the right and left don't trust her.</comment>

<comment>State colleges used to be free. He's not suggesting that private colleges should be free. He wants kids who are not wealthy to have a chance. That's the position of a traditional Democrat. And as for getting things done. Take a look at Bernie's track record in the Senate :https://www.congress.gov/membe...</comment>

<comment>Hilary doesn't get anything done, all she ever does is constantly backflip on issues then ends up on the wrong side anyway</comment>

<comment>Also, his plans for banking and credit are amazing and would be an incredible boost for the consumer. :)</comment>

<comment>Send a message and Vote!"His refusal to accept the status quo  of the the wealthiest Americans using their power to influence politicans matters to me.

<comment>M  E  O  W  !!!!!!</comment>

<comment>You realize that 'bootstraps' has always been a bad joke that idiots take seriously?That's because it's physically impossible to pull oneself up by ones bootstraps.</comment>

<comment>I just present it back at Republicans when I have the chance.</comment>

<comment>He certainly doesn't seem afraid to say what he thinks, or to stand and defend his policy positions and beliefs. Clinton comes from an unfortunate habit and tradition of being gun-shy of anything seen as too left wing, and even if she's a pretty astute politician who sees the way the wind is blowing, you don't shed decades of reflexes like that overnight. (Though I'd still certainly prefer her to any of the candidates I see on the Right)</comment>

<comment>Good point. So far I've contributed small sums to Sanders and no one else. I will vote for him in the primary and obviously in November, but if Clinton is the nominee I will gladly vote for her in Nov. over any Republican now running.A Republican controlled White House will almost certainly come along with Republican control of both the House and Senate (perhaps with a 60 vote filibuster proof majority) to be shortly followed by more Republican SCOTUS judges. That would be a disaster for 99% of U.S. citizens, including the tens of millions who will have helped create the disaster by voting Republican this November.</comment>

<comment>If Sanders doesn't get the nomination and Hillary Clinton does, it's almost a guarantee that Trump will not only get the GOP nomination, but win the Presidency, as well.</comment>

<comment>true-- also she has a lot of baggage, even tho most of which is exaggerated and contrived, but many voters believe all they hear.  In addition, in the small chance she is indicted or the FBI says she broke the law, I think she is sunk.</comment>

<comment>Clinton is a moderate republican.  It's as simple as that.</comment>

<comment>i've always been amused by the comment made by alan greenspan on fox's neil cavuto's show (9.18.07) :"I thought Bill Clinton was the best Republican president we've had in a while."</comment>

<comment>It's easy to feel the wind blow through flip-flops.</comment>

<comment>Haha.  What?  Anyway, I like the comment.</comment>

<comment>this is one of those wonderful comments that say nothing but seems that it should so you keep turning it over looking for something.</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton, like many, if not most politicians, has pandered to the very worst elements here in the United States.  So has Barack Obama, and all of his predecessors.Sanders, on the other hand, has done no such thing.</comment>

<comment>I can see it.</comment>

<comment>Both Bernie and Trump are fascinating candidates who threaten to upend the status quo. This is the most exiting election I've ever seen.</comment>

<comment>I agree. </comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders I like!  Trump...uh uh!</comment>

<comment>The only problem for Bernie and your good self is that if someone who is white, male or native born fits your profile, then Bernie's party is going to reflexively call that person a moronic, racist, sexist, xenophobic monster.If Trump and Sanders are on the ballot in November, Trumps wins.  It really is that simple.  Whites and native born are still 2/3 of the electorate and they understand the DNC hates them and wants them to die.</comment>

<comment>Your hyperbole game is strong.</comment>

<comment>Thank you.  I like to think I've learned from the best at Salon, the Guradian and Mother Jones.</comment>

<comment>Go to Faux, Breitbart, etc. They're infinitely more hyperbolic.</comment>

<comment>No, it's the reverse according to the polls. Sanders handily beats Trump in a matchup.</comment>

<comment>Even if Hillary gets on the ballot in November, Trump will even more likely win, because there's still a great deal of overt and covert sexism here in the United States.  Lots of people aren't ready to have a woman POTUS.</comment>

<comment>...he's sober.</comment>

<comment>Sorry.Bernie is just a simple mistake. Too many people on the right want Bernie to win just like too many people on the left want Trump to win the primaries. Why?Neither is competent to run the government or to win a general election. To suggest on any level that Hillary is boring is without depth (kinda Trump like). Yes...data and information, knowledge and experience is boring to anyone without the capacity to understand anything beyond a surface argument.The reason the Repubs hate Hillary is simple, she will do the best job in moving the country to a better place that does not include the rights’ agenda.Bernie is a magical elf that is making you not see clearly. This is the real world and for once in a long time we have anincredible candidate who is anything but boring….she is incredibly competent, exciting in her ideas and abilities and will get enormous things done right for you and this country. All it takes is a little reading from a Google search to see her shine.</comment>

<comment>All it takes is a little reading from Google search to see how often her positions change whichever way the wind blows. "Gay marriage? Let me check the polls....nope, not quite yet."I may not necessarily agree with every position Bernie holds, but it's refreshing to see someone who has stood up for what they believe to be right and true with consistent positions since 1970s, well before popular opinion supported those positions.Integrity in politicians is rare - and something I want in a president.But you're right - Clinton is a more experienced politician who certainly knows how to play the game well. The problem is, I (and I think most Americans) are tired of the game and its players because it's broken.</comment>

<comment>Perfectly well said.</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>MJ, I'm not sure the comparison with Trump is valid. It may be the same voter angst over stagnant incomes and politicians that are bought and owned by wealthy doners; but they are opposites in style. However, I would agree that Bernie is sincere and would also add consistent in his message about helping the middle class. Furthermore, Bernie's policies seem well thought out and defensible (I've seen some tax plans by many in the GOP that are disasters). As far as Hillary is concerned, I she her as inconsistent and inauthentic, which turns me off even if I may agree with the policies. I don't vote by party and have voted for both parties. But if the election was in the next day, I'm with Bernie. </comment>

<comment>You're absolutely spot-on here, MovieJay!  Bernie Sanders is the best POTUS Candidate that we've had yet.  Here's hoping that he wins the 2016 POTUS Election.  Wouldn't that be a fabulous way to show that that United States is a good, decent place to live, with decent leaders, etc.</comment>

<comment>/has actual policies and GOVERNING EXPERIENCE. dont forget those bits</comment>

<comment>The last thing we need is another white dude as President.</comment>

<comment>You're so right.All we should care about is our president's gender or ethnicity.  I agree.  Everything else is immaterial.</comment>

<comment>troll alert</comment>

<comment>That is not trolling. It is pointing out the hypocrisy in discriminating based on race or gender. We should always vote for the best candidate regardless of gender, race, orientation, religion, etc. Even if it is a white dude.</comment>

<comment>I don't know how long you've been here but courageousmisterj is a troll.</comment>

<comment>Oh, I thought you were talking about Blogvader. Got it.</comment>

<comment>That's what we call Poe's Law. There are people on my side of the aisle who actually say things like this without any irony. They're called "SJWs" and they're our equivalent of birthers and fundies.</comment>

<comment>it looks like you are calling Blogvader a troll for his use of sarcasm because you replied to him. I think that is the confusion here.</comment>

<comment>Although your sarcasm may be too subtle for some, I like it.</comment>

<comment>Subtle? Your kidding right?</comment>

<comment>Just understating for effect.</comment>

<comment>Sanders stood with Dr.King, and wants to continue his work. Bernie may not look like the face of a Revolution, but look at all the people behind him, BLM and the99%.</comment>

<comment>He may not be black or female, but he would be 1. the 1st ethnically Jewish president; 2. the oldest president; 3. the 1st president since Abraham Lincoln without a religious affiliation; 4. the 1st self-described socialist president.</comment>

<comment>And the first time the Presidency would be a payraise. Somehow that says alot to me</comment>

<comment>My son and I (both Jews) were speculating last night on what the White House would do differently if one of us were elected.  I said "No Christmas Tree! No Easter Egg Roll! Pesach dinner both nights with lots of guests and my recipe for gefilte fish!"</comment>

<comment>And there it is, ad hominem, based on race and gender of all things.There is no clearer indication that they're afraid and have nothing else to offer.</comment>

<comment>So where are the 'other' candidates? Ben Carson? May be a good surgeon, but no grasp of the issues or foreign affairs. Cruz and Rubio? Whiter than white. I would vote for a poka dot, cargo cult believer if the candidate was able to address America's problems</comment>

<comment>Oh, come on!</comment>

<comment>Since her poll numbers started cratering after Trump's counterattack it's logical to assume he played a major role.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a master of persuasion.</comment>

<comment>"Trump is a master of persuasion."Yup!  For people who know little or nothing about the true-blue facts.</comment>

<comment>Sorry. Wrong. Correlation does not equal causation. There's some basic logic (and statistics) for you.Further, any attempt to dive deep into political campaign strategy by analyzing solely superficial events like Donald Trump's attacks or Clinton's emails will lead nowhere. You have to examine how the campaigns are mobilizing, and at it's most basic, Bernie has more volunteers, he has more excitement, and he has a better message.But what trump has to say? Nobody except Trump supporters care about that.</comment>

<comment>"Correlation does not equal causation."___Bah. David Hume disproved causation almost 3 centuries ago, and no one has rehabilitated it since then. There's no causation.But do a thought experiment: if every time you put your finger in your nose, someone kicks you in the balls, then eventually you'll conclude that it's irrelevant whether your putting your finger in your nose *causes* you to be kicked in the balls; correlation is enough.</comment>

<comment>Ah. A philosopher. Try an actual experiment, and I bet you'll find that unlike Pavlovian dogs, some of us as rational beings can assume that there IS causation there because there's some jackass who tries to kick you everytime you pick your nose. Then you pick your nose when said jackass isn't around. This is the real world, now.I appreciate your response, but when trying to understand trends in the real scientific world, causation does matter.</comment>

<comment>"...causation does matter."___No: that still doesn't mean it's causation. That means, as I said last time, "correlation is enough".And in your previous post to which I replied, you dismissed someone who didn't understand the difference between causation and correlation; and when I called you on it, you replied that "some of us as rational beings can assume that there IS causation" but haven't given even the slightest reason to think that my example was causation rather than correlation... you just want to (I'm quoting you here) "assume" it is.Well, fine; if you get to "assume" that correlation is causation, which is what you did, then so can the earlier poster to which you replied.Your implicit position is that when other people, like shinynewtoken, "assume" that correlation is causation, it's (I'm quoting you here) "Sorry. Wrong.", but when you do it, you're being "rational".</comment>

<comment>My apologies for not bringing enough nuance to the discussion. Had I used the term "deduce" or "conclude" instead of "assume," perhaps your understanding of my comment would've matched my intentions, and you would've saved 3 paragraphs to write about something other than a poor word choice. That is my fault, though; I acknowledge that. Moving forward...As, however, everything in your comment not dealing with the word "assume" and rebutting my main argument is only two sentences, I shall further elucidate my point by going deeper into the conclusion, and offering another example.Referring to the nose-picking jack-ass balls kicker example, let's give a name to our victim: Zero. When Zero gets kicked in the balls whilst picking his nose, he will deduce that there is some neural process in the jackass who's kicking his balls that associates outward behavior of nose-picking with deserved punishment of balls-kicking. Sure, this conclusion comes from a correlation. We see that balls-kicking happens more often when nose-picking occurs, and you're right that that may be good enough for most people to assume causation. However, good enough doesn't mean it's correct. Zero can make different conclusions on what causes the balls-kicking based on who is doing it, how often it happens, who else is getting their balls kicked when picking their nose, and when nose-picking occurs without balls-kicking.In other words, correlation can be "good-enough" to assume causation in that one instance, but correlation by itself won't hold up in future repeated experiments and experiences, due to the fact that there are what we call confounding variables. Let's say that we want to examine living standards (because balls-kicking is a horrible thought-experiment, no offense). We examine that households who have more HDTVs typically get better healthcare. As you're suggesting, Hume would conclude, because "correlation is enough," that buying HDTVs will bring you better healthcare. This is, of course, preposterous, because those households who have more HDTVs likely have more money to spend on healthcare.Further, to say that Hume disproved causation isn't really giving us an accurate picture. Hume disagreed that observing something is a logical step to making a conclusion about it, in that what you experience isn't going to be universally true. For instance, "all solo cups I've seen are red, therefore all solo cups are red" is the type of logic that Hume disproved. We, however, have the ability to observe multiple experiences thanks to fields of science that have come after Hume's time, and are remarkably more efficient at developing accurate conclusions, with limited human error. If he has indeed disproved causation, instead of making the argument that its difficult to prove causation through experience, please cite your source and show me that Q.E.D.So, let's talk about shinynewtoken. Why do I believe he's wrong? It's not even a matter of correlation vs. causation, really, if you're looking at the entire history of Trump. It's not like he's only recently been attacking Hillary. He's been doing that for the past few months, but Hillary's poll numbers have hardly lowered since then. In addition, I believe he's wrong because the issue of who supports whom is an issue that has too many facets to say one specific entity is the sole reason of its shifting.</comment>

<comment>"As you're suggesting, Hume would conclude, because "correlation is enough," that buying HDTVs will bring you better healthcare."___To clarify: "correlation is enough" is me, not Hume. Hume dismissed causation beyond repair, and it's never been successfully rehabilitated by anyone. That being the case, I see no reason to pine for it, or to dismiss correlation for failing to measure up to something that doesn't exist anyway.But then I'm more optimistic in general than Hume was, and that's why I think correlation is enough.Either way, if you're holding out for causation, you're not going to get it.</comment>

<comment>Your response is a tautology, though. Causality doesn't exist, because it doesn't exist.</comment>

<comment>"Your response is a tautology, though. Causality doesn't exist, because it doesn't exist."___No: As I said in my first post, David Hume disproved the concept of causality and no one has been able to rehabilitate it. The reasons causality is an invalid concept are there for you to read. Here's a link:http://www.gutenberg.org/files...The fact that I haven't reproduced David Hume's entire argument here doesn't mean that my agreeing with it is a "tautology"; that's not what a tautology is.Technically, of course, it would be self-defeating for me to say that I disbelieve in the concept of causation *because* of having read David Hume; if I don't believe in causation, then I can't attribute a cause. But honesty requires me to acknowledge that I stopped believing in causation *after* I read Hume. So clearly my having read Hume is *correlated* with my disbelieving in the concept of causation.</comment>

<comment>More people are realizing that Hillary is a LIAR about speaking with the Bengazi families on the tarmac, about her email server, about compromising classified information, about Bill and his history with women.  I think people are hearing the double-speak from Hillary and are reminded of her history.</comment>

<comment>A couple questions for you. Whats your most important issue for the presidential election?  Will you be voting in a Democratic primary this year? Which state? Assume you will be voting for Bernie. Thanks. </comment>

<comment>I found out to my surprise yesterday that she has even "evolved" on guns, and spoke fondly of her own shooting days when Obama made the "cling to their guns" comment. Now Chelsea is out discussing how Bernie wants to repeal Obamacare,  instead of the truth, that he wants to expand, simplify and improve it. I believe the reason she is losing popularity is her lies are catching up to her, again.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Honestly - it sort of restores my faith in people.No more Clintons or Bushes in the White House please.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders has more authenticity and concern for the people in his little finger than the entire corporate DNC and GOP put together.</comment>

<comment>But can he be president? He has to be equally matched to the forces that will be attempting to destroy him, from members of his own party in Congress to world leaders. Maybe he's better off staying in Congress.</comment>

<comment>Isn't it too late for him to change his mind about running for pres?Besides, if he loses he'll still be a senator.</comment>

<comment>Being president is a different animal. I like him for it, but I'm just not sure he's up to the task.</comment>

<comment>"Being president is a different animal. I like him for it, but I'm just not sure he's up to the task."My first thought is in that case you should vote for Clinton in the primary.My second thought is a question: If Bernie Sanders wins the Democratic nomination will you vote for him in November?</comment>

<comment>I don't know. That's why I putting the question out there to see what others think.</comment>

<comment>You apparently don't know his history. He's a more shrewd and strategic politician than what the media would have you believe. He's not the longest serving independent in Congress's history for no reason after all.But he still has morals and values, which he's kept for 40+ years along with his spine. A good leader has morals, is willing to listen to his advisors, and will fight for even the least of us. Whether you know it or not, Bernies a fighter, and he's a good one.</comment>

<comment>I wasn't denigrating his record. I was simply suggesting that politicians may start out with noble intentions but usually have to go at least a little dirty to fight. He seems to be one who isn't willing to get a little "dark side" on him.ETA: I also don't want to see him lose that authenticity or concern in order to play politics. </comment>

<comment>Right. I didn't mean to insinuate you were denigrating him. Apologies.Though I worry that you were swayed by the Sith lords to believe the dark side is the strongest inherently. The dark side has its strengths, but ultimately is its own undoing. ;)</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is different, in that he'd have enough spine to fight back if necessary, but not to pander to the very worst elements in the electorate population, the way most politicians, including Barack Obama, have.</comment>

<comment>Of course he can be president. He's strong, he's truthful, he's authentic. I'll certainly be voting for him.</comment>

<comment>Well said, Robin.</comment>

<comment>Then there is the fact that Hillary is a complex and unlikeable candidate (not nearly likeable enough) - and she brings with her that air of entitlement that is only exacerbated when Bill and now Chelsea are enlisted to gang up on Sanders. And the trumpster is right about one thing: Bill (who tore down glass-steagall, legalized the credit default con, and ended welfare) is actually a liability.</comment>

<comment>Although I certainly would not endorse most of Sanders' views, he has conviction and authenticity - qualities Clinton notably lacks.  Mind you, I still expect her to crush him eventually (unless the FBI investigations into her get hot) because most partisans will fall into line for her, but the reason he and Trump are getting traction is extreme dissatisfaction with the political establishment across the ideological spectrum.</comment>

<comment>I'll write Bernie Sanders in if he doesn't win the nomination. I'm absolutely sick of mealy-mouthed liars.</comment>

<comment>Same here.  I took the online Bernie or Bust pledge.  I'm so done with the bought and paid for politicians.  We need to get Citizens United law overturned.</comment>

<comment>Clinton's whole strategy has been to be inevitable since she lost to Obama in 2008.   If she loses that claim to inevitabilty, she's incredible vulnerable, because at least among the Democrats I know, most of the people who would poll her in column don't actually like her.   If Sanders starts to feel like a real alternative, it could be rough for Clinton.If she makes it through the pimaries, I'll vote for Clinton over any Republican in the field today, but I'll have to hold my nose while doing it.   She's too old, too dishonest, too hawkish, and too completely in the race for her own gratification rather from any sense of the countries needs, to be an easy vote.</comment>

<comment>Well said, Clinton would be far better than any of the Republican candidates...but that is a low bar.If there is any common sense and common human decency left in this country, then Bernie Sanders is our next president.</comment>

<comment>PS. Age is not a factor...both Clinton and Sanders are competent...but Sanders actually represents the needs of the future.  That makes him young in spirit and in terms of political necessity.</comment>

<comment>I am a lifelong Democrat who would never vote for a Republican but I am not looking forward to voting next November because I believe that Hillary Clinton is the most dishonest, crooked politician since Richard Nixon.  All of my Democratic friends are very, very unhappy that Clinton will be the nominee of our Party.To say that there is an enthusiasm gap on the part of many Democrats for Ms. Clinton would be the understatement of the day.  We cannot bring ourselves to vote for a Republican but we really do not want to vote for our likely nominee.  I hope that Bernie Sanders can pull off a miracle and then choose Elizabeth Warren as his running mate.</comment>

<comment>Me too.</comment>

<comment>Vote in the primaries for Bernie Sanders and try to take some friends to vote with you.  We cannot have her be the nominee.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you all the way. I would only add that the miracle would be even more likely if Elizabeth Warren came forward early as Sanders' running mate. She would draw bigger crowds on the campaign trail than Clinton or Sanders. She could fill stadiums!</comment>

<comment>We should demand to see the VP short lists that the POTUS candidates have put together right now, not a few weeks before the election... some daylight and transparency would be lovely.</comment>

<comment>If you aren't planning on voting in the primaries, please reconsider and vote for Bernie.  Try to bring some friends with you to vote.</comment>

<comment>Well don't let that happen.  Make sure you and all of your friends vote in the primaries for Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>As a lifelong Republican I just might vote for Sanders. I am listening to what he says in any case. I think it's time for some honesty and shake up in DC even if I don't agree with every plan he has. We've had 16 years of the exact same thing and it's not working for anyone except corporations and drone manufacturers.</comment>

<comment>Don't just hope.  You and all your friends need to show up and vote or caucus for Bernie in the primaries.</comment>

<comment>I think Clinton got a bit of a bump from her performance during the Benghazi inquisition (AKA "The Gowdy Doody Show") but that's wearing off now.</comment>

<comment>She showed her mettle; you gotta give her credit on that one.</comment>

<comment>Yes, she did well. I think she'll make a good president.</comment>

<comment>As a US Senator, Hillary Clinton voted to invade and occupy Iraq.  Was she simply a shallow ditz, brainwashed by the Neocon lies and half-truths?  Or was she following the orders of  her financial backers?  Is Mrs Clinton incompetent or corrupt?Either way, the woman is unfit for the presidency.Hillary is the only candidate still in the race who voted to invade and occupy Iraq; maybe people are starting to wake up and smell the coffee... Hillary is too inept, too corrupt, too short-sighted and has too much political baggage to become POTUS.No doubt about it, invading and occupying Iraq was an enormous blunder and the unforeseen consequences of that foolishness will continue for generations.</comment>

<comment>She, like most politicians, votes for what is best for her. She thought voting for the war would gain her support in the long run.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  Hillary never factored in the human and economic  costs of the war, it was always about her political career.Mrs. Clinton voted with 28 other Dem Senators, because she did not want to be seen as being on the wrong side of history... now that we can see how counterproductive the Iraq War actually was, she should be made to regret her stupid decision... Hillary and the Democratic party just want to sweep that dirt under the rug.Bernie Sanders was never brainwashed by Bush and the neocons, ergo, he is a much better choice for POTUS, compared to  the inept/corrupt Mrs. Clinton.</comment>

<comment>He may be a better moral choice, but he probably would not get much congressional support from either side. Politicians value their job too much to swing too far from the center.</comment>

<comment>Hey, we already have Congressional gridlock, even without Bernie in the WH.  The country is extremely polarized; stand by for more legislative paralysis, no matter who wins in November..</comment>

<comment>Agreed. I am simply betting it can still get worse as some on the left will not go as far as Sanders wants.</comment>

<comment>If the Senate and House remain in GOP hands, no Democratic POTUS will be able to get much done... if a Republican wins the presidency  and the Senate and House remain in GOP hands, we will see a powerful lurch to the right.  Thankfully, the Canadian border is only about 70 miles from here.... only forty miles, if I cross Lake Ontario.. I could become one of the "boat people" too.</comment>

<comment>I think if Bernie wins the White House, we will have a democratic senate and gain seats in the house.</comment>

<comment>I dunno about that, but I think if we get the aforementioned Republican trifecta, 2018 will show us a Democratic Senate and big gains in the House. Just the way things go...</comment>

<comment>Well at least with Bernie as president, he's not going to throw the poor and middle class under the bus for political expediency.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if she would have voted for the Iraq war if Chelsea would be sent there to fight in that war.</comment>

<comment>It is rational to agree with Sanders' positions. It is rational to want him to win. It is irrational to believe that he can win.</comment>

<comment>He polls better than Hillary against all GOP clowns...er... I mean, candidates.</comment>

<comment>Polls are meaningless right now. The polls in 2008 showed Clinton winning at this same point. Once the political machines kick in, Sanders will not have a chance. Fear will reign.</comment>

<comment>Then to hell with with it. I will not be browbeaten into voting for another corporate stooge.</comment>

<comment>I am not saying not to advocate for who you believe in. You should. But consider your energy a longer term investment rather than having immediate payoff.</comment>

<comment>It's no better having Hillary than the GOP. Maybe even worse. Their goals are essentially the same. At least with the GOP in office dems put in cursory resistance.</comment>

<comment>I understand why you feel that way. I do not trust Clinton. But there are certainly policy differences. We rarely get the exact person in office we want. There almost always are tradeoffs. It is a long term game. Culture and politics move slowly and incrementally, at least in this country.</comment>

<comment>This is one of the most disingenuous talking points being circulated by Bernie supporters. HRC is more a corporatist Dem than Bernie, but beyond that there aren't many differences in their stances.</comment>

<comment>Bernie is NOT BOUGHT.  That is a BIG DIFFERENCE.</comment>

<comment>Really?  Want to talk about Wall Street reform and trade agreements?</comment>

<comment>This would be correct, except for a little thing called "Article 2, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution."I'm a diehard Bernie supporter from Vermont, but I'd vote for Jim Freaking Webb over any Republican, just to ensure that we won't have any more Scalias or Alitos appointed to the Supreme Court in the near future.</comment>

<comment>One question:  Are you OK with a 45 year old Scalia/Alito clone replacing Ruth Bader Ginsburg?  (And potentially Kennedy and Breyer too).</comment>

<comment>I heard the same thing from Nader voters in 2000.  There was and is a vast chasm of difference between Republicans and Democrats.  The claim that they are 'essentially the same' is profoundly ignorant.Progressive voters who value their own purity more than results deserve no respect.</comment>

<comment>I piss on your respect.</comment>

<comment>Well, exactly.  Approximately 3000 Nader voters in Florida pissed all over the country/world in November of 2000.  That worked out great for everyone, didn't it?But you go ahead and let 'er rip.</comment>

<comment>I blame Jeb Bush, not Ralph Nader, for the debacle in Florida, in 2000.  That Son-of-a-Bush is absolutely corrupt.</comment>

<comment>As corrupt as he was he never would had mattered if Nader had not gone on a crap-on-America egotrip that lead to a mass screwing unrivaled in our history.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, Nader is/was a grandstanding loser on an extended ego trip.</comment>

<comment>But he told the truth though and people see that now.</comment>

<comment>They're as short sighted as the morons who've drummed the RINOs out of the GOP and handed that party to Trump.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>Just vote for Bernie in the primaries.  If all his supporters show up in the primaries and vote for him, he'll win!</comment>

<comment>Again with this red herring. Robin is talking about polls comparing Dem candidates to GOP candidates. It's not about Clinton winning. It's about Sanders winning by a safer margin.</comment>

<comment>The problem with any polls right now is that most people are not tuned into the election process yet. That will change. Advertising will portray Sanders as being dangerous. They will bring up his socialist ideas and equate them to baby killing communists. They will resurrect Sanders rape fantasy writings from the 1970's. They have not begun to unload on him yet. Putting any faith in margins right now is extremely premature.</comment>

<comment>That kind of ugly negative dirty and untruthful crap will backfire on Clinton...and Strengthen Sanders for the general election. </comment>

<comment>People do have the Internet to look up meaning of democratic socialism.  They are SICK of bought off politicians.</comment>

<comment>They tried all the smears in the book on Obama. Remember Rev. Wright and "God Damn America"? Sanders will tackle every smear as Obama did.</comment>

<comment>Maybe. Sanders admitting and fully advocating his socialist positions could be a step too far for some. It will be interesting.</comment>

<comment>All he needs to do is repeat what he already said in his woefully under-covered speech at Georgetown about his label: https://berniesanders.com/demo...And in particular, he should keep repeating this line:"I don’t believe government should own the means of production, but I  do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce  the wealth of America deserve a fair deal."</comment>

<comment>Thats wht Obama beat her in 2008, eh?</comment>

<comment>Then there's no point to this article.  I think you mean after the primaries began, Clinton was defeated.  However, the political machine was clearly behind Clinton in 2008 and not Obama but it was Obama who won the nomination. So the narrative of 2008 may hold true in 2016 and Sanders will win the nomination.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that's right.  Clo...candidates...right...candidates.</comment>

<comment>Thank you, I've been trying to tell people that since day one, and all they do is give me ____. http://predictwise.com/politic...</comment>

<comment>Yeah I think people get so caught up in what they want and believe, they think that the rest of the nation feels the same way. It is confirmation bias in that they seek out others with common beliefs. They can truthfully say "Everyone I know believes...."</comment>

<comment>OMG, I actually saw a comment that read "I don't know of one single person who supports Hillary Clinton" As if that somehow makes her invisible or something.</comment>

<comment>Scan the comments here today. There are a few of those already posted. It will be an interesting election year for sure.</comment>

<comment>You're going to be eating your words in about a month from now when Bernie wins Iowa and New Hampshire.</comment>

<comment>I have been wrong before and I will certainly be wrong again. He very well may win Iowa and New Hampshire. And Clinton should be concerned. But in the election it is the swing states that matter. If Sanders becomes the nominee, of course the solid blue states will vote for him. But Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, etc will be a little tougher for him. I just don't see it, but it will be interesting however it turns out.</comment>

<comment>And if he does win, so what? Does he have a way to defeat her southern firewall or a way to make the delegates already committed to her?</comment>

<comment>Two of the whitest states in the US... when he's polling well under 30% with black voters and ~30% for Latino voters. He's toast the minute the primaries get out of white states, which is immediately following NH.</comment>

<comment>Is it rational to ignore the polls and the trends and the momentum?Sanders can win.  Nothing is written in stone here. </comment>

<comment>OK, I won't say impossible. But I will still hold that it is highly improbable. The polls and momentum are too early to mean much. They should make Clinton worry, which she obviously is given her sudden response to Sanders in the last few days. But polls are not predictive just quite yet.</comment>

<comment> Clinton is more of the same. Sanders represents the potential for real change and tells it like it is. This should be obvious.Obama in the eyes of Progressives sold out on his 2008 campaign promises and delivered a presidency that was closer to another 2 terms of Bush then what he campaigned for in 2008.Clinton would be no better and probably worse in that she is very prowar and the economic policies that she, along with her husband supported are responsible for the 2008 crisis.Sanders has been for the most part, a man that has stuck with his progressive beliefs and is far more likely to serve the needs of the average American. You can also tell by the campaign contributions that Clinton receives. </comment>

<comment>But would Sanders be able to accomplish anything while in office? You could have the most pure and altruistic person in the world as president, but if they cannot build consensus in the Congress, what good will they do? The Supreme Court nominations are about it.</comment>

<comment>Better to accomplish nothing than to accomplish things contrary to the interests of the people.</comment>

<comment>That is an asinine sentiment.</comment>

<comment>No it isn't. Given two choices of things staying the same or getting worse, which would you choose?You can't always get what you want. But if you try sometimes, you might find, you can hold your ground.</comment>

<comment>The interests of the people are often not the best thing for the people. Many people want to keep out Muslims, should we do that? Repealing slavery wasn't a popular idea at the time. If Lincoln was interested in doing things based solely on the interests of the people, the institution of slavery may still be active today or at least lasted another decade or two.</comment>

<comment>You're confusing "interests" with "expressed desires." The Patriot Act and TSA's security theater are not in the interests of the people, though a huge majority supported those measures in the aftermath of 9/11. Lincoln is actually a fabulous example: he acted in the interests of the nation, albeit contrary to the expressed desires of many.</comment>

<comment>We tried the Third Way Democrats and republicans but look what happened.  Addressing income inequality, poverty, and jobs is a good thing for the people.  This is not the 1800s, it's 2016.</comment>

<comment>And by addressing you mean submitting legislation that will never pass?Just because someone talks about something doesn't mean they are able to change it. I agree with most of Bernie's policy ideas. I also understand the current political climate and know that most of what he advocates for are non-starters with congress. Republicans aren't all of a sudden going to say you know what, Bernie is right. Let me turn my back on my supporters and donors and support Sanders.</comment>

<comment>No it's not. It's asinine to vote for more of the same or worse.  Republicans are talking about impeachment of HRC when and if  she takes office.  How much do you think will get done with HER in the White House?</comment>

<comment>Not a lot, but more than would get done with Bernie. He supports things that many Dems are uncomfortable with. If there were myriad progressives running with Bernie in a real revolution, I'd be on board. As of now there are a few progressives who aren't going to overhaul the party. Progressives need to also understand that there are plenty of Dems that are moderate and don't want to go that far to the left.</comment>

<comment>True</comment>

<comment>Well that alone would be huge. At this point I would say the SCOTUS is more important then congress since they actually seem to get work done.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I wasn't minimizing the Supreme Court nominations. It is that people get so caught up in thinking that once their guy gets elected, everything will change. I talked about it with people when President Obama was running the first time. He is just a man. He cannot part the seas and he has to work with Congress.</comment>

<comment>I guess you were sleeping that last 8 years.  The Republicans in Congress refused to work with him.  So at some point you learn from your mistakes and move on.  As Sanders pointed out, there are things that the President can do without Congress.  Obama was not willing to do that.  He thought he was working with adults.  He didn't learn from his mistakes.</comment>

<comment>It's better to move only one inch in the right direction than one mile in the wrong direction.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. But just as with President Obama, people have this false hope that all will change when the new guy steps in.</comment>

<comment>Bernie has said himself that no president, can do it all and that's why he's calling for a political revolution.  Obama didn't do that and Obama had a superpac so he was beholden to his puppetmasters.  Bernie doesn't have a superpac so he's beholden to the American people.</comment>

<comment>Kind of like what Obama told his supporters until he took office.  You know that change stuff.Bottom line is Sanders wants to try.  Obama folded.</comment>

<comment>Nobody paid attention to Obama's donors before he took office. Obama sold himself and was a corporate candidate before he took office. This is what makes Bernie different. It's what separates him from Hillary as well. He will walk the walk and not just be a talking head for the things we need in this country. Additionally, I (and I hope many others) have grown tired of sitting on the sidelines. If we continue being engaged, we can throw out politicians who will not side with our interests. Doesn't matter whether they have an R or D by their name. What matters is who they represent.</comment>

<comment>The error in your assertion is that you fail to see that Sanders   is much more than a single candidate.  He is part of a movement that will elect progressive leaders throughout all levels of government.Democratic revolution is not instant coffee.</comment>

<comment>You are apparently not aware of the animosity the Republican party has for Clinton.  Good luck building that consensus.  Not too mention there are things the President can do without Congress.  So yeah that consensus thing...</comment>

<comment>Bernie can be as progressive as he wants to be, its not going to help him enact his agenda. It's alarming how many progressives don't seem to understand how the government works.Obama didn't sell out anyone. He only had 59 days (spread out, not consecutive) of a super majority. Progressives stayed home and the red wave of 2010 happened. As a result there is a GOP congress and they aren't going to sign off on anything Sanders wants. Sanders supporters talk of revolution but there are few progressives that are running with Sanders. A POTUS is only as good as the Congress behind him. As long as people like yourself continue to believe that the presidency is a one man show, you will continue to be disappointed in the results.</comment>

<comment>You are correct but evidently don't  realize that Obama failed to keep the movement alive.  He killed it after he got his personal ring of power.Sanders won't fall into that trap.It will take a few election cycles but we can become the government...most Americans are ready for genuine positive.          Progressive transformation. </comment>

<comment>Obama didn't kill the movement, unrealistic expectations of him did.</comment>

<comment>You also fail to understand the power the President has.  You also forget the people in Congress like Elizabeth Warren.  You also forget that most Americans (Conservative and Liberal) support Sander's policies, e.g., his stance on trade agreements like the TPP - that translates into votes and pressure on Congress.So no we don't have to accept some limp President and we can do away with this canard about compromise.</comment>

<comment>You fail to understand how government works. What legislation has Warren got passed?90% of Americans wanted background checks, it took an executive order from the POTUS to get it done. Populist sentiment doesn't always translate into legislation.</comment>

<comment>Obama did sell out. The proof is always in the numbers.https://www.opensecrets.org/pr...Some of his biggest donors were Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Citi Group, Time Warner, Microsoft, GE, Morgan Stanley.The cities who raised the most for him were, in order, New York City, Chicago, and Washington DC.We do not think Sanders is a one man show. We are coming off the sidelines and getting into the process. Real progressives are jumping on board, along with libertarians who are tired of crony capitalism, and other independents.</comment>

<comment>You don't think that if Sanders wins the nomination that he's going to be getting people who work at Goldman Sachs, GE, Time Warner et al donating to his campaign? Really? You really don't get how this works, do you?</comment>

<comment>Oh I get exactly how it works. Corrupt politicians sell themselves out to corporations to get elected and then they make sure the crony capitalism (i.e. socialism for the rich) gravy train keeps on a rollin'. You can check out Obama's, Bush', and Cinton's department and staff appointments to see the revolving door of big money friends. Well guess what, this time Bernie is in the race and has always ran on grassroots funding. He doesn't want Goldman Sachs and Time Warner's money... and that scares the [expletive] out of them. What you tools and the establishment don't want people to realize is that we can fund a national campaign.The Numbers:In 2012, there were 235,248,000 eligible voters.If 1% of the 2012 eligible voters (2,352,480) had donated $200, 2% (4,704,960) had donated $100, and 4% (9,409,920) had donated $50, the result is $1,411,488,000.THAT'S $1.4 BILLION DOLLARS WITH DONATIONS FROM ONLY 7% OF THE ELECTORATE. WAKE UP PEOPLE WE DON'T NEED THEIR MONEY. ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BAND TOGETHER AND OVERTHROW THESE USURPERS!!!</comment>

<comment>lol That's not how it works. Your fantasy re-enactment of how you believes it works is adorable though.</comment>

<comment>I don't have to believe anything. The facts are out there and America is catching on because the media cannot set the political discourse with new generations and the internet. What's adorable is you think anybody is going to be persuaded by your sorry hack methodology. Why don't you make your discus profile open so we can see who you work for? Your comments never seem to sound like a genuine human being's thoughts.</comment>

<comment>Whether my comments sounds genuine to you is none of my concern. It is hilarious however that you don't think liberal employees from banks and media firms wouldn't be donating to Sanders campaign should he win the nomination. Adorable, I say! The CEOs of the banks? Nearly all of them are Republicans who donate to other Republicans. Isn't Citi at the top of the list for Hillary? Yeah... Citi's CEO donated to McCain and Romney's failed presidential bids.</comment>

<comment>Well maybe you are just a die hard Hillary supporter. Regardless, if you think these banks donate to her campaign and superPACs because they care about liberal causes, rather than expecting returns on their dollar, you are the one who is adorable and naïve. They gave speaking fees to her just because they think she is such a good policy expert and she deserves that amount of compensation. According to Open Secrets she already has over $20 million in superPAC money or about 21% of the money behind her. This does not even include the $2,700 plate events she has. Bernie's outside money consists of less than 1% and he has an average campaign donation contribution around $30. Why doesn't Hillary release her average donation number and how much percent of her donations were the maximum $2,700 allowed?Additionally, if you don't understand that Wall Street, big Pharma, big AG, the defense contractors, and big oil contribute to both republicans and democrats to ensure that no matter which side Americans choose a corporate candidate makes it into office, you are a sheep and asleep at the wheel. The two party system is a vetting process for the oligarchy to make you think you have a choice in democratically electing your leaders. This is why no one even knows who Jill Stein is and any of the other 3rd party candidates. This is also by Bernie faces a blackout. This is why there is a super delegate system in place to stop Bernie. It's not my thinking which is childishly adorable, it is yours for thinking money in politics does not matter.</comment>

<comment>What you're failing to understand is that it's not the banks that are donating... it's the bank's employees. And these same employees will be donating to Sanders if he wins the nomination. This is not institutional money... it's individual contributors. You don't have your facts straight.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for telling it like it is, NoldorElf!  Bravo!  I wish I could be as articulate and succinct as you are in pointing it out!   Thank you, thank you, thank you!!</comment>

<comment>I think people would rather have a flake in office than a criminal.</comment>

<comment>According to this highly credible site, Senator Sanders has not accepted a dime from one of the most powerful lobbies in Washington, DC: The Israel lobby.Source:http://maplight.org/us-congres...I resent the fact that the Jewish state wields more influence in Congress and the WH than any US-tax-paying state within our union of American states.Apparently, Bernie is not another tool of the war-mongering  Israel lobby... he's probably the only Senator who is not on the take to the Israel lobby... perhaps the only member of Congress who has not accepted cash from that powerful lobby.I'm supporting Bernie Sanders for POTUS, now call me an anti-Semite!</comment>

<comment>For people that want rape legalized. </comment>

<comment>Sanders crushes Trump in all the polls, bring it on.</comment>

<comment>Just the opposite, the more people get to know him, the more they approve of him over that wig wearing loon.</comment>

<comment>Toxic rape supporter says what?</comment>

<comment>When you start to scratch the surface I dont see much of a difference between Trump and Hillary.At best they are flip sides of the same coin at worst they could be bedfellows.</comment>

<comment>Why anyone is giving much credibility to polls anymore is beyond me. Some 60% or more of polling is done via landline telephone. Know anyone that has a landline anymore? I bet they're not younger that 45. Even my parents who are in their 60's recently got rid of their landline. Facebook,twitter,google, etc. is a more credible source for understanding which way the country is leaning, and social media says America is feeling the Bern! Bernie's numbers will steadily rise as grandparents hear his message through the grapevine of younger voices. The Wall Street owned media corporations will continue to ignore Bernie for as long as they can, they will try to scare the enthusiasm out of Bernie fans with these landline polls, but no one can hold back the tide of Bernie and this revolution.</comment>

<comment>I totally agree. I don't know a single liberal or progressive who prefers Hillary over Sanders, and I know a lot.</comment>

<comment>I prefer Hillary because she has a more realistic chance of winning and is better at playing the game of politics.</comment>

<comment>I strongly disagree on both points. We'll see.</comment>

<comment>And that's one of the main points in Bernie's favor.  People are sick and damn tired of these games.  They're playing with people's lives and they're tired of it.</comment>

<comment>Politics is inherently a game amigo.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't have to be.</comment>
