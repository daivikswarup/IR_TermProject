<comment>I don't care how old they are or if they are replaced, as long as we have Paper Ballots and not some computer controlled by who knows who counting the ballots. We have had enough of that nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Paper is the best way to go, esp. when the results from some machines show a high statistical likelihood of tampering:http://ivn.us/2015/07/20/repor...The AVS WinVote systems used in Virginia in numerous elections were so ridiculously easy to untraceably hack it's horrifying:https://freedom-to-tinker.com/...A simple scantron system works better than anything that's tried to replace it, is cheaper, is more reliable, and has a paper trail making verification/recounts easy.</comment>

<comment>This is another issue where the Dems are wimps, they should be screaming and pounding the podium making complaints.</comment>

<comment>They should.  From the start voting machines were a solution looking for a problem.</comment>

<comment>via http://www.democraticundergrou...Air America Radio's Mike Malloy gave the most succinct and passionate explanation in his Wednesday, November 3, 2004, program :"The American vote count is controlled by three major corporate players, Diebold, ESS, Sequoia, and a fourth, SAIC, Science Applications International. All four are hard-wired into the Bush power structure, the Bush crime family."They have been given millions of dollars by the Bush regime to complete a sweeping computerization of voting machines that were just used in the 2004 election. The technology involved had a trial run during the 2002 mid-term elections. Georgia had Diebold machines in every precinct. As a result, a popular Democratic governor and senator were both unseated in what the media called an "amazing" 16 percent swing."Diebold's Walden O'Dell, a top Bush fundraiser, publicly committed himself to delivering his home state Ohio's votes to Bush. At Diebold, the election division is run by Bob Urosevich. Bob's brother, Todd, is a top executive at "rival" ES&S. The brothers were originally staked by Howard Ahmanson, a member of the Council For National Policy, a right-wing steering group stacked with Bush true believers. Ahmanson is also one of the bagmen behind the extremist Christian Reconstruction Movement, which advocates the theocratic takeover of American democracy."The four companies are interconnected; they are not four "competitors". Ahmanson has large stakes in ES&S, whose former CEO was Republican Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska. When Hagel ran for office, his own company counted the votes, and his victory was considered "an amazing upset". Hagel still has a million dollar stake in ES&S."Sequoia is the corporate parent of a private equity firm, Madison Dearborn, which is partner in the Carlyle Group. (Also see here.)"Meanwhile, SAIC is referred to a "shadowy defense contractor". They have gotten into the vote count game both directly and through spinoffs by its top brass, including Admiral Bill Owens, former military aide to Dick Cheney, and Carlyle Group honcho Frank Carlucci and ex-CIA chief Robert Gates. SAIC's history of fraud charges and security "lapses" haven't prevented it from becoming one of the largest Pentagon and CIA contractors, and will doubtless encounter few obstacles in its entrance into the vote counting business.

<comment>Part of me wants to say, "why can't we just have online voting?  Voters go to the public library, show their voter registration and a photo ID to a volunteer, then log in with their voter registration number and vote electronically." Then I read Uncle Luie's comment and realized my folly.I guess paper works then, perhaps we could do without a machine and simply use a pen to mark choices, as in the old days. I would add that we should start stamping voters' hands when they go in to vote, to eliminate double-dipping and keep everyone honest.</comment>

<comment>NPR was just talking about this this morning.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps an obvious question? in relative terms (vs. Machines) how much does it cost to administer the vote by mail systems in WA, OR and CO?</comment>

<comment>I don't have any figures, but my suspicion is that it's either comparable or less, because there's little need to purchase, repair, and upgrade expensive voting machines. If I wasn't at work I'd research it for you, but I should be at least a little cautious while I'm on the clock.</comment>

<comment>You still can't beat a paper ballot and check the box. It's as close to idiot proof as you'll ever get.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I don't trust the vote counters. Especially when they're beholden to the elected.</comment>

<comment>Why can't I vote online? I can go online, access my bank accounts and transfer money easily enough, but we can't trust computers enough to allow me to vote online? Secure websites are easy to set-up, seems like the obvious tact to take.</comment>

<comment>Secure websites are easy to set-upSure, just ask the DOD, IRS, Target, TJX, Ashley Madison, Home Depot, USPS, JPMorgan, Sony, Staples, Anthem Health Care...</comment>

<comment>Ask them what? Stupid examples, no system, including the system we have in place today is perfect. But your ok with millions of dollars being transferred today via online banking, but you can't trust voting online? What a joke.</comment>

<comment>Correct.  I'd rather have my bank account stolen than a national election, that's orders of magnitude worse.</comment>

<comment>Well when you are broke yes. But, it would be easy to keep a national election from being "stolen",  you could mail copies of the voting record to the household as confirmation (much as bank statements and other records are sent out today). You can also statistically verify voting patterns, seeking for any irregularities. There is software that can be used to track voting patterns for fraud, etc. Face it, the reliance on paper ballots is ridiculous, its time to move on to better technologies.</comment>

<comment>Yes, by all means, let's hand the Chinese hackers the keys to electing our politicians.</comment>

<comment>So Its safe enough to send millions of dollars via online banking everyday, but not safe enough for voting. How paranoid do you have to be to believe that?</comment>

<comment>Your assumption about the "safety" of online banking is unfounded.http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry...</comment>

<comment>Meaning what, that it isn't perfectly safe? No, but obviously it is safe enough that 10's of millions of people use it everyday. That should be safe enough for voting, except for those that don't understand that nothing is 100% safe.</comment>

<comment>Your scale is completely irrelevant. "Safe enough for voting"?Here's the thing - banking transfers are constant, ongoing, and distributed. That's why these hackers, who wanted billions, didn't go after individual accounts, or single transfers. They went straight to the banks themselves, learned the systems, and broke in.Just like the Chinese hackers who found their way into OPM, without that much effort, and stole 20M+ identities, including SSNs, and 5M+ fingerprints.Hmm, the chinese have 20M socials, and 5M fingerprints, just laying around. How are we going to verify online voting? Possibly.... socials and fingerprints? Assuming we can even get advanced enough to include bio-security?There's either 5M or 20M votes that they can override right out of the gates! But hey - why would the Chinese want to influence OUR elections, AmIRite?Nor would eastern european/ possibly russian hackers, like the guys who stole credit cards from target and sold that data for roughly $27/ card, netting upwards of $50M against 1-3M credit card numbers. I'm sure no one would want to spend 50M to buy 1-3M socials, and therefore directly steal 1-3M votes. It's not like people spend BILLIONS just on advertising to influence votes, AmIRite? Nobody would rather spend $50M to simply buy those votes! Nor would FSB want to hire those hackers to steal those ID's and take over those votes... simply because Russia/ Putin would like to choose our politicians for us. Right?Nope, online voting sounds like a great idea, particularly given the track record of online security for simple things like stealing a few million or billion dollars.</comment>

<comment>Well, that makes my case even easier. Online voting wouldn't involves 10 of thousands of bank, but a much small population of entities, which makes it even easier to protect. Look, its not that difficult to build authentication technology into enrollments, its done all the time today, and works really well. Even if voting credentials were stolen, its easy to prevent the further use of the credential, just like a stolen credit card can be shut down. Plus, it could be as simple as voting online, and then a voting receipt is mailed to you for verification. Any large scale discrepancy would easily be picked out. For all your fear that the Chinese and Russians would try and defraud US elections directly by attacking our voting process, those guys know that is a poor use of dollars. Its much easier to get the Koch brothers or some other large company that has an economic interest to simply fund a PAC for select politicians.</comment>

<comment>Mm hmmm. And once you've navigated the absolute mess of local/ state/ federal funding disputes about who should pay for this and how...You're still stuck with the facts thatA) the U.S. Will Not issue new socials to anyone, ever. But hey- that's an easy thing to just suddenly change, right? Oh- and you can't "issue" new fingerprints. And no- I don't want the U.S. Gov housing MY fingerprints, given that they just lost 5M of their employees fingerprints.B) "authentication technology" is about the most generic description of online security I've ever heard . Are you daft? Really? Plenty of people still have the password "password" on their emails. Most people still haven't enabled two factor authentication on their iPhones. At least gmail requires it- but still, hack some cell towers (already happening, by the way, on a near constant basis), and you've just conquered two factor. But for most- a simple phishing email will do the trick. And given that there are literally Billions of stolen emails tied to identities (Sony hack, Target hack, OPM, banking hacks, credit card hacks, etc), phishing a few million people to screw with their votes would not be difficult.Voting receipts- Nope! You've just violated federal law that ballots must be secret- so that people can vote with confidence knowing that they will not be penalized for the "wrong" vote by someone who attempted to intimidate them in advance. This is an incredibly common requirement across developed nations- non-secret voting causes massive problems, and is not a viable option.All this boils down to- you have literally no idea what you are talking about, and have so far only spouted vague, Trump-esque, generic nonsense ("Build an Internet wall! Make Mexico pay for it!"). If you have some actual cogent thoughts here- I'm all ears.</comment>

<comment>Man, I give you credit, if you were paid by the word, you would be a millionaire. Where to start? How about that "ballots are secret", no they aren't. Ballots are read by machines, confirmed by humans, and oh by the way, voting records are public information. Do you not remember "hanging chads" being checked by people? Seriously, you think your vote is secret?So, authentication doesn't work? You yourself admit that "most people use the word password" so if it is so full of holes, how does the world of internet even function? Since everyone is compromised so severely, where is all the massive undermining of the internet? Why would anyone ever touch or by online, since its so "easy" to take over others identities and walk away with all their money? Your position on the riskiness of the internet environment is overblown. Is there fraud? Sure, but clearly, its not sufficient to stop commerce.Bottom line, any country would be crazy to try and influence a US election through direct voter fraud, its too easy to spot. Instead its the influence of money that is a greater danger, and certainly much more difficult to prevent and stop.</comment>

<comment>Secret ballot laws- wrong. It's enshrined in law, all your points are nonsense.This very site wrote an article on it:http://www.theatlantic.com/mag...Your stubbornness on this is also laziness. This took me 2 minutes to find."Where is the massive undermining of the internet"- I gave you many examples. Target, billions from banks, OPM, Sony, etc etc. the perps have no desire to bring the Internet crashing down- then they can't suck value off of it. Instead, they are parasites. Parasites do not want to kill the host. But if they can control it? Yes, they would like that.Manipulating votes- it's been done, in the U.S., in the last 60 years, at the Presidential level (JFK). It's been done many times at lower levels."crazy" and "too easy to spot". We constantly "spot" the Chinese hacking into: newspaper sites, government sites (OPM), NUCLEAR siteshttp://www.mercurynews.com/bus...THE WHITE HOUSEhttp://www.foxnews.com/tech/20...What on earth could possibly make you believe they give two sh its about being identified, or seen as "crazy"?!? What evidence do you have that somehow voter fraud would be "a step too far" for hackers willing to try to gain access to NUCLEAR SITES?Are you really this naive? Or is it willful?Either way- you've made a bunch of bland vague assertions. You have zero facts backing up any of these. Zero evidence, trends, anything. Just "I don't think it will happen, just cause!!!"And you've been dead wrong in every "fact" you've tried to claim, like secret balloting. Wrong.Seriously, try harder.</comment>

<comment>So ballots are secret, but voting records are public? Does that make any sense, well, it probably does to you.Try looking up your own record here. Oh wait, maybe its a fake chinese hacked site, that is setting up a trap to steal your identity and install an impersonator as a senator!! http://www.publicrecordsoffici....You don't trust technology, yet, here you are using technology to make your paranoid points. You must have some major security software installed to overcome this fear, or you are schizophrenic and simply not taking your own advice. Feel free to live your life in a bunker, as for me, I am not worried that some international spy ring is going to hack into our systems and take over the internet and install a puppet president. Please..</comment>

<comment>Cheap android tablets can sell for $50. Ditto cheap printers. Get a standardized android election machine build, have it print both the actual choices with names on the ballot, as well as a QR code- and speed up counting, with a fail safe for recounts and errors.This is not rocket surgery.</comment>

<comment>My precinct uses paper ballots. I would guess they are counted by machine, but at the polling place there was just markers, ballots, and ballot boxes. Fine by me!</comment>

<comment>Vote-By-Mail is the only way to fly. Paper ballots, secure drop sites (I personally never actually send mine through the USPS, just to be sure it doesn't get lost in the mail, but apparently that never really happens and I'm just being nervous about it), and weeks and weeks of time to read over the voters' pamphlet, carefully fill out the ballot, and drop off or send in my vote. I can vote days and days ahead of voting day, and rest assured my ballot will still count. If I'm busy, I can vote around my schedule without having to miss work or other obligations. If I'm lazy, I can scramble out to a ballot drop late in the evening on Election Day and still drop my ballot in the slot, without even having to get out of my car. As a result, we have some of the highest turnout rates anywhere. And since ballots are checked against state records, the chance of any sort of widespread fraud is almost nonexistent.We've been using VBM in Oregon for something like 20 years - longer than I've been old enough to vote - and I can't imagine doing it any other way.</comment>

<comment>WE ARE THE ONLY RICHEST DEMOCRACY ON EARTH THAT WOULD HAVE *TROUBLE* RAISING THE MONEY TO REPLACE OUR VOTING MACHINES. Sorry for the yelling. I had to get that off my chest.</comment>

<comment>In Canada we only use paper ballots(except in municipal elections)  - the type you mark with a lead pencil - no chads. It works just fine thank you.Unless I missed it in the article it is amazing there wasn't a section on just how insecure, subject to tampering, electronic voting machines  are.</comment>

<comment>This demands action.  We need to block these things at every level in the election board at all areas around this country.  This is terrible the direction that we are headed at this rate.</comment>
