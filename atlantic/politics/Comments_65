<comment>Snowden leaked only what his Russian master wanted him to leak. Always interesting in that there is little about Russia and China in what's out there.</comment>

<comment>Snowden wound up in Russia because the US refused to allow him to go on to the country he intended. Read before posting.</comment>

<comment>And also, because he fled the country he was born in.</comment>

<comment>Amerika is more like a prison than a country.</comment>

<comment>If the contractors aren't protected it sounds like an argument for not using contractors.</comment>

<comment>Contractors are motivated by money - the more people they give clearances, the more people they employ, the more of our tax money they are paid. Incentives built into their contracts should make us very nervous. </comment>

<comment>The author asks the wrong question. Intelligence elites should be prosecuted for their crimes against citizens and foreigners, not protected by national security platitudes and the scapegoating of whistleblowers. Intelligence elites and the political leaders who enact their unlawful policies are the real threat to national security and peace. They should be hanged when found guilty of torture and extrajudicial executions, or at least confined in solitary confinement until they expire naturally, using the example of the Nuremberg Trials and punishments to eliminate these monsters who infect policies with totalitarian abuses.</comment>

<comment>Whistleblowers publicly revealing secure information should not have protection, unless the subject matter involves a war crime or other directly-attributable loss of human life.  Manning and Snowden did not even try to reach out to public officials.The 'anti-war' and anti-state zealots just want to maximally harm the government, hence the reckless data dumping by Manning and Snowden, both of whom are traitors. I generally oppose the extent of American militarism, but I'm not a utopian or pacifist who thinks it is all unnecessary.</comment>

<comment>Those who support the crimes of the state are the traitors. Traitors to both the nation, and humanity.</comment>

<comment>You mean the "people" whom the government is supposed to serve, not control and work against?  I hate to tell you this, KoreanKat, but you label actual heroes and patriots with the name that you so righteously deserve.</comment>

<comment>Logistically? Then the whistleblower will go to the media afterward and instead of revealing sensitive information in the context of their limited perspective,  they will reveal these things AND the fact that they first  went to a congressional committee and there was no 'satisfactory resolution' - which becomes more powerful politically. Loose lips owned by someone of a limited perspective to an even more limited perspective populace, and horrifying everyone doesn't have much appeal. I don't have faith in these congressional committees to understand and resolve sensitive issues effectively given their political motivations and have even lesser faith in the whistleblower savior and media combo when 'media' seems to have lost its will to be responsible in favor of being sensational. I have no idea what is going on behind closed doors when it comes to intelligence and counter intelligence, and there is no one qualified to be an appropriate authority figure to 'trust' and 'analyze' the wisdom, ethics, or overreach of what goes on. Media has taken itself out of this role. It is all very frustrating and at this point, 'trust' vs. 'overreach' seems besides the point. Everyone lies and no one can be trusted to tell the whole truth and 'we can't handle the truth.' So I guess we are simply left with 'effectiveness' as our measure of nationalsecurity and the certainty that the means are unethical. Must we simply embrace 'ignorance is bliss' when our ignorance is absolutely undoable? We will never know the secrets of the inner circle, and Snowdens can only describe their piece of the elephant which will make things seem either way scarier and more menacing or way less scary and less menacing than they really are - but reveals nothing of the whole. We know no more or less after the efforts and risks taken by seemingly heroic Snowdens. No one person has knowledge of the whole. The animal is way too big. And answering to 'us' would only result in what we all do not want - unacceptable vulnerability. I would argue specifically about two statements in the article that cannot be taken as true. 1) whistleblowers are often protected in other arenas (absolutely not true) and 2) whistleblowers have noble intentions - forgive my skepticism - I think it more likely they don't like to think of themselves as a cog in a bigger wheel and suffer at least a bit of narcissism. We want to both 'be protected' by people trained to be ruthless and suspicious and we demand to 'trust those protectors.' That is not going to happen. It's a scary world.</comment>

<comment>Citizens are qualified to determine if security state policies are ethical, which is why those policies are made secret and kept from them by the policy makers and operatives who carry them out, and, worse, who insist on the imprisonment and execution of the whistleblowers, who expose their malfeasance, in order to maintain their power to commit crimes in the name of the state.</comment>

<comment>Citizens - policy makers are also citizens. They are informed citizens and those who serve in intelligence have clearances. We elect them. This idea of direct oversight by 'citizens' is laughable. These policy makers are elected by is and given authority by us. If 'we' have done such a bad job at electing our policy makers that they appoint Supreme Court justices who make corporations into 'citizens' and dilute our votes, if 'we' elect corrupt and corruptible policy makers, that is our fault. How laughable to distrust our elected policy makers to the point where we neuter them. How idiotic to distrust elected officials but then trust any old 'citizen' with oversight of intelligence - along with everybody seeking to harm us. </comment>

<comment>The citizen policy makers eliminate the citizens who oppose them through unlawful means such as prosecutions for revealing their crimes, outright murder, and use of propaganda to fool a large sample of citizens into thinking these policies are national defense, making the policy makers and actors immune to democratic remedies. It is citizens fault the policy makers persecute and exile the truth tellers, but when it comes time to storm the New Bastille, these citizens cower in fear developed by the torture, prosecutions, and executions of the courageous citizens who opposed them.</comment>

<comment>Devolved to tin foil hats. Oh well. Having an actual enlightened conversation might have been interesting.</comment>

<comment>Hiding behind the authoritarian conspiracy claiming discontent is an irrational conspiracy is a habit of cowards, and one developed by their masters.</comment>

<comment>At least you hope so - otherwise - medication!!!</comment>

<comment>The people who aren't in power, will want to empower the whistle blower, until they are in power. And suddenly, transparency becomes a distant memory, like a fart in the wind.</comment>

<comment>If we would stop doing illegal sh!t, overthrowing foreign governments, and murdering people, we wouldn't need all this secrecy.Whistleblowers should receive protections and awards.  This is supposed to the government of the people, not against the people.  Fascism is the takeover of the government by corporate interests to exercise total control over the people.  The TPP was negotiated in absolute secrecy by the corporations to give those same corporations their own worldwide legal system that trumps the power of the democratic state. If we were waiting for a shark-jumping incident, that should be it.Chelsea Manning is in jail for 35 years for disclosing war crimes, and she's the only one in jail.  No one from Goldman went to jail and they crashed the entire economy through outright fraud.  If we don't protect whistleblowers, we will know nothing, and actual fascism will continue to take hold.</comment>

<comment>Everyone should read Classified Woman by Sibel Edmonds before taking a position on this question.  Here's the cliffnotes from the ACLU:  https://www.aclu.org/sibel-edm...</comment>

<comment>Incompetent translator hired by FBI in late 2001.Incompetent translator fired in March, 2002, i.e., worked less than six months, maybe as few as three. In that short time, she claims to have discovered Great Evil. Yeah, Right. First year employees know everything.Translator then files suit that has endured 25 to 50 times longer than the tenure of employment (!)Knee jerk symptathizers refelexively buy in to absolutely preposterous theory of termination and agency wrong doing,Have I got it right?</comment>

<comment>Er . . .. Snowden didn't blow the whistle on anything. What he did was disclose an incredible amount about the LEGAL activity of the NSA, much of which did great damage.He didn't proviide a scintilla of evidence of any crime.Neither did Manning.</comment>

<comment>It's funny how when you own the government nothing you do is a crime.</comment>

<comment>Wellllllllll. . . it has something to do with tha tthere's this Congress, you know? And if you keep within the statutory framework it sets up  . . . .  you haven't committed a crime.Kinda simple, really.</comment>

<comment>Moron. It is not simple. It's the furthest thing from simple.There's a law against walking around your house naked. There's a law against drinking 4 sips of beer standing up. There's a law against opening your wife's mail to pay the bills.*EVERYTHING* is a crime. There are zero law abiding citizens in Amerika.</comment>

<comment>You realize, of course, that your post makes no sense?</comment>

<comment>It's not simple because there are too many non-obvious laws for a human to remember and obey, some of which are a serious hardship to obey and which breaking causes no harm, some of which are contradictory.</comment>

<comment>Er . . .. Snowden didn't blow the whistle on anything. What he did was disclose an incredible amount about the LEGAL activity of the NSA, much of which did great damage.He didn't proviide a scintilla of evidence of any crime.Neither did Manning.</comment>

<comment>If something the government is doing isn't a crime, but citizens believe it is (or should be), then it demands debate -- which can only happen when people are aware of it.</comment>

<comment>(a) The law is right there on the books for anyone to read. In fact, the NSA made a huge mistake in treating this stuff with Cold War protocols. It should have been bragging on these programs. There is no KGB-like Islamic group sophisticated enough to explout every last little crumb of intelligence.But, more to the point .  . .(b) The programs go on substantially as before, despite 'reforms' that are largely cosmetic. Which is as it should be, because they don't actually infringe privacy concerns - never did - and are quite useful as security.Which means the citizens DON'T believe in criminalizing this stuff.  Which means Snowden isn;t a whistleblower, but a scandal-monger, and a small-time traitor. He did a passel of harm for self-aggrandizement.Which means he has earned a lot of frree rent.</comment>

<comment>There is a war on whistle blowers, which requires a more in-depth analysis of this problem and a stronger reaction from the public. Drake was harassed, stalked, surveilled, set up, and blacklisted. Manning and Sterling went to jail (Petraus did not). There's also Wiebe, Binney, Akwei, and others. The media needs to do these stories justice. There is an incredible amount of information and abuse the public needs to be aware of. Many of us are incredibly grateful to ALL of these whistle blowers - even Snowden, who showed what thousands of Americans were alleging (but nobody would listen to them or believe them - they were dismissed as 'crazy' or as 'conspiracy theorists'). We must learn the full story of the whistleblowers and protect these truth tellers. They have done us an immense service, which society only knows a fraction about.</comment>

<comment>Why is my opinion only worth you letting me post on certain stories?https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Let me sum you up...Egghead notices that some policy is not producing it's stated goal, which conveniently benefits some segment of society with power.Egghead suggests in good faith a way to adjust policy to achieve stated goal, while incidentally harming said segment of society with power.Egghead waits with baited breath for politicians to notice his brilliance and implement his policy.Nothing happens.Egghead wonders who politicians don't do this very obvious thing that would achieve stated policy goal, and incidentally harm said segment of society with power.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that any government you could actually trust wouldn't be engaging in questionable programs in the first place.</comment>

<comment>"Whistleblowers provide Congress with a critical tool for sorting truth from fiction . . . "And we've seen so much evidence that this Congress is interested in sorting truth from fiction.</comment>

<comment>"Behind those doors, members of Congress and their staff review our nation’s most secret espionage programs. "Those same people had to sign additional NDA's just to read Hillary Clinton's emails.</comment>

<comment>Intelligence Whistle-blowers are protected. Thomas Drake was not indicted for going to Congress or the DoD Inspector General. He was accused of espionage for giving information to the press. The program about which Mr. Drake was supposedly concerned was in fact investigated by the DoD Inspector General upon the reports of Mr. Drake and others. The IG investigated the program and determined that it was in fact a failure, so the claims that nothing is ever done are patently false. Mr Drakes whistle-blowing activities ceased and became a espionage after the fact when he went to the press.</comment>

<comment>Revealing the government's business to citizens is considered espionage not only by the killers employed by the security state, but by the citizens most susceptible to the security state's propaganda campaigns.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you go find a country that doesn't have any need for an intelligence or security agency. You might be happier.</comment>

<comment>The people on the line fighting our enemies includes whistleblowers. And heads of enormous organizations are really no different from politicians in their motivations. Some will have integrity and others won't. When you come across those who don't, working within the system can be futile and personally very dangerous.</comment>

<comment>The trusted professionals of the intelligence state smuggle heroin from Afghanistan, prostitutes from Kosovo, antiquities from Iraq, organs from Palestine, and murder anyone who would attempt to expose their business interests.</comment>

<comment>a strange questiondepends on whether or not they harm the nation, no?</comment>
