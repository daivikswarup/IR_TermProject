<comment>Congress had better not block funding. It won't play well.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. The public, which tends to overstate the chances of actually contracting many diseases (remember the Ebola scare?) won't go for that at all.</comment>

<comment>Americans go without homes, healthcare, secure borders, education, jobs, potable water, paved streets and public safety but Obama wants to spend money on mosquitoes. Can't wait until this cretin is gone.</comment>

<comment>You and Proxmire.</comment>

<comment>And if he weren't doing it, the RWNJs would be complaining that he wasn't protecting our children.</comment>

<comment>I'd rather the funding go to the border patrol to keep the people carrying this disease out.</comment>

<comment>SMH.  Luddite warning.</comment>

<comment>Mosquitos didn't bring Zika to the US. Latinos did.</comment>

<comment>Hawaii??</comment>

<comment>It's carried by mosquitos genius</comment>

<comment>Lets keep the Latin people out until they sort this Zuka thing out for themselves.</comment>

<comment>There is so much unknown about this virus that is concerning.  What about potential harm to babies and young children?  There are a number of southerns states with a very large aeges aegypti mosquito population (the mosquito that spreads Zika).</comment>

<comment>Zika is another tempest in a tea pot.http://www.activistpost.com/20...</comment>

<comment>But it will be used to push baby-killing rights in Latin American countries and also to send billions of US dollars there. Sorta like the African AIDS 'crisis'.</comment>

<comment>So we don't want them to kill babies, but we shouldn't pay to help them so they don't have to.</comment>
