<comment>Jeb Bush's problems are not sharing a name with his brother. It's sharing the foreign policy team that got us into Iraq (Wolfowitz...really?), an inability to recognize and refute his brothers foreign policy failures, evidence be damed and now his obvious pandering to the religious right. He's just more of the same and while American's have short memories, they, hopefully, aren't that short.</comment>

<comment>W did seem to be less in control of his foreign policy than his cabinet was. I worry that with Jeb, no matter what he professes on the surface, his questionable team will be the ones really making the decisions. Very good point.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, it isn't so much about memories as it is about "my team vs your team."In a deeply divided electorate and geography, nearly half the nation is poised to vote for whichever Republican (or Democrat) makes it through the gauntlet, regardless of personal flaws or policy nonsense.</comment>

<comment>It's "gantlet."</comment>

<comment>Naw. You have to understand - most Amerikans are idiots. They won't look at the policy team and make any sort of judgement. They kinda think the president is 'the decider' and makes decisions on his own.Bush's problem is a B followed by an u followed by a s followed by a h. That's going to associate him with the former Bush in the average sheep's mind, and most of them realize, vaguely, that Bush II was not a great prez.Also, being soft on illegal immigration is not going to help him with ANYONE.</comment>

<comment>When you say Amerikans, you must mean self identifying Republicans, because Americans I know are not sheep, and are acutely aware of the tangible ways GWB degradaded this country: lying us into war and tanking the economy aren't vague or obscure to comprehend.  Yes Jeb is guilty by association, but only because he is not staking out his own platform that comports with reality. THIS is what people realize.</comment>

<comment>Want to know the extent of what the average Amerikan realizes about politics in this country?"Kim Kardashian's butt sure is hot."</comment>

<comment>The snide, cynical posturing is understandable, and thus tolerable, in a clever 14-year-old.Somehow, I doubt that's your age.I'm confident you know better than this, and this is just posing.If I'm wrong, I apologize for the unwarranted compliment.</comment>

<comment>I'm not nice. Or honest. I am, however, very very rich.I'm very very rich because I'm not nice. Or honest.</comment>

<comment>No, you are just another liar.</comment>

<comment>Does it make you feel better to believe that there are not filthy rich communist jerks in the world? Who, incidentally, did nothing to deserve being rich?Now get my Mai Tai, you dirty pov.</comment>

<comment>Lol! Yea, right. You are rich and you are pounding away on your keyboard pimping for some con man.</comment>

<comment>Where's my Mai Tai? If you don't make it right this time I'll dismiss you without a reference.</comment>

<comment>I will right after you are done cleaning my house. I do not allow drinking on the job.</comment>

<comment>I had always thought of all the Bush sprogen, Jeb would've made a decent president - but when I saw he put that smarmy, lying snake Wolfowitz on his payroll I lost all respect for him.  It's not a stretch to imagine that, if elected, Jeb would bring back many of his brother's "old guard" who were responsible for destroying Iraq and upending the middle east.  No thanks.</comment>

<comment>And that's the good part.His economic stances are even less defensible.</comment>

<comment>I hope he brings back Rummy and Codi too.We're getting the band back together!</comment>

<comment>Already had one f/tool who convinced himself he was on a mission from God.We barely survived that one -- and many thousands, including some of the very best of us, didn't.</comment>

<comment>The Iraq question will not go away anytime for Jeb Bush and other Republican candidates for president especially with the chaos and fall of Ramadi to ISIS. At least Hillary has admitted that she "made a mistake" in her vote to authorize the war. But the Republicans, when asked, will always go back to the Clinton votes as if to say, see, Hillary voted for the war, it must have been the right decision by W to go to war even though evidence then and now refutes this position.The greater question for Jeb Bush and other candidates is: What did the US learn from invading Iraq? By not articulating answers to this question, these Republican candidates show no foresight in foreign policy because they'll do Iraq all over again it seems. Well, as Santayana famously said, "those that do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it." The good thing, however, is that the American people have no appetite for wars.</comment>

<comment>It's simply amazing how Obama escapes responsibility in your mind for anything that has happened in Iraq for the last six years. Has somebody else been President?</comment>

<comment>Dodge-o-saurus Rex - nice try. Lol.</comment>

<comment>it's funny, the Right loves to blame Obama for the sad state Iraq is in, even though it's entirely THEIR fault.  Yes, O's been president for six years - he came into office bound by the Status of Forces agreement W signed (probably misspelled) in 2008.  See, the Iraqis WANTED US OUT. They got tired of seeing their civilians being mowed down and in order for our troops to remain, they wanted them held accountable under Iraqi law - meaning no more get out of jail free cards.  Has Iraq gotten markedly worse since 2008 - yes.  What could O do about it?  Short of flooding the country with U.S. troops and hardware, not much. Think America wants its sons and daughters sent back into that meat grinder?  Sure the Republicans would love that because then they could screech at how Obama's started the war again.  He's too smart for that.  We'll see what Hillary does when she's president.</comment>

<comment>Anybody remember that GWB signed the SOFA (Status of Forces Agreement) with the Malaki government in November of 2008, which meant that meant that US forces could no longer operate in Iraq. So while the actual draw-downs were in 2009, they were going to be necessary unless the US was willing to see our soldiers tried in Iraqi courts, under Iraq law.</comment>

<comment>What I'd really like to know is why nobody has yet asked Jebbie the other obvious question:"If it had been you that got the briefing, 'Bin Laden Determined To Strike In US,' would you have blown it off as your brother did?  If not, what would you have done differently?"As far as Publicans are concerned, GWB is STILL the one who "kept us safe" -- because there were no OTHER 9/11s on his watch.</comment>

<comment>Jeb Bush can't even answer a give me question about learning from your mistakes given by Meagan Kelly on Fox News.Ignoring the toxicity of the Bush brand, can we really support someone like this? This is just indicative of Jeb's larger issue, he doesn't know what he's doing and it shows in his awkward campaign. I wouldn't even call Jeb moderate, he's just incapable of clearly saying his positions.</comment>

<comment>I don't think he's that incapable of clearly saying his positions, I think he's stuck trying to toe the line of sticking to being a moderate versus going full wingnut in order to appeal to the base.</comment>

<comment>Jeb's is not a moderate.  Remember the Terri Schiavo fiasco. His foreign policy team is nothing but the GWB neo-cons.   A moderate position on immigration does not make him a moderate. He's just trying to play one on TV.</comment>

<comment>As Frum alludes to above, Jeb's immigration stance isn't really "moderate". The MSM calls it that, but in reality his stance - including the stance of all other prez candidates - will harm working Americans and greatly help the wealthy.There's a reason why USChamber, WalMart, and McDonald's want immigration reform so much, and it isn't to help their workers make more money.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, he is NOT moderate on right to life issues, but he is moderate on other issues besides immigration.</comment>

<comment>Name a few.  It isn't foreign policy.  He's hired his brother's neo-con idiot brigade as advisers.</comment>

<comment>Patience. Full wingnut stage isn't far off.</comment>

<comment>He, and many others who want the ego trip of being USA president, seem incapable of being any kind of leader.</comment>

<comment>He's not so very different from Killary, on policy or on trustworthiness.If the two of them had a baby, what would it look like?</comment>

<comment>Rich.</comment>

<comment>(13 years ago, when he was president, I wrote speeches for him. Now, I write for a magazine.)Meritocracy!</comment>

<comment>(13 years ago, when he was president, I wrote speeches for him. Now, I write for a magazine.)How about the author - a step up or down the ladder? Hmm?</comment>

<comment>For himself, down.For Muslims across the planet, very much up.</comment>

<comment>Good question. In the troll swamp he and his ilk marinate in, it's a lateral move on balance - a step down in power but a step up in prestige and becoming a Public Intellectual and a Person To Be Taken Seriously rather than a speechwriting monkey.For the Atlantic, on the other hand, employing him is like falling right off the ladder. ETA did I seriously misspell "ladder?" Coffee time</comment>

<comment>Spelling is an obsolete skill. I have the spelling ability of a 3rd grader - but I outsource the work to Google spellcheck. All you need is the ability to read what Google spits back at you.</comment>

<comment>I'm amazed the Atlantic can't find some one with ideas and conservative credentials and instead choose to foist this Bushco apologist on it's readers.</comment>

<comment>Now, now. Frum has, in the past six or so years, been largely exiled from the conservative movement precisely because he's been willing to call a red-nosed, schizophrenic clown a red-nosed, schizophrenic clown.</comment>

<comment>I agree. We can't expect people not to have opinions and not to have a back story. We just need to know what it is. I read this piece as a progressive and can't find anything in it to criticize. If Stephanopoulas can work for ABC news, why can't Frum work for the Atlantic. It just means the media "consumer" needs to consider the source of the information we're getting and cast a bit more widely.</comment>

<comment>So conservative writers are only represented by the Four Jackasses of the American Apocalypse: Neo-Cons, Glibertarians; Christian Fundamentalists and Teatards? There is nothing but dead-enders and zombie Reagan? There's no one rethinking classical liberalism for a modern age and reintroducing it to civil libertarianism? That's kind of sad. Is the Atlantic not allowed to import someone from Europe?</comment>

<comment>Uh, wheresoever did you manage to draw a zero-sum conclusion? I'm just saying, Frum's past as a Bush ball-licker does not make his work since then invalid.</comment>

<comment>Disagree. Any now trying to feign respectability who had roles in the Bush administration are not so.  They should be cowering in a cave in shame.  Just sayin'.</comment>

<comment>Frum is one of the few conservative opiners who's somewhat on the right side of immigration without also being a mouthbreather. He's wrong on various issues, but he's more right on an important issue like immigration than the Reagan clones that would apply if the Atlantic sought a Conservative Voice.OTOH, he won't reply to me on Twitter so I hate him too.</comment>

<comment>People do change. I loathed Patrick Buchanan in the 1960s, 70s and later. Yet today (with certain caveats) he speaks more truth than most. I truly believe he has changed his views.Perhaps the same is true with Frum. Just because one starts out a villain, doesn't mean one ends up one.Yet his article doesn't really set out any particular political philosophy or show any that he has had any road to Damascus epiphanies.People change. Look at David Horowitz who dazzled the 1960s with his left-wing Ramparts and who now frightens babies who haven't even seen him.</comment>

<comment>Be nice, he's a Canadian after all and you might hurt his feelings.</comment>

<comment>Both Hillary and Jeb are both flawed candiates with their own unique baggage, legacy issues and a inarticulate message. The difference is the GOP has numerous alternatives who can win the nomination, while the Dems are stuck with a scandal ridden candidate with more negitives than positives in Hillary. </comment>

<comment>GOP may have numerous alternatives, but each is worse than the last. These are not serious candidates. They're just filling in seats in the GOP clown car.</comment>

<comment>When your only options are Hillary and Sanders, I wouldn't talk about clown cars.</comment>

<comment>Both are far better options than anyone the Republicans have offered up.</comment>

<comment>A socialist and a dirty grandma? No I don't think so...</comment>

<comment>Define socialism. I bet you can't. Funny thing is neither can any other conservative I've talked to.</comment>

<comment>He calls himself a socialist. Socialism:  any of various economic and political theories advocating collective or governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods. Un-American.</comment>

<comment>Show me how Bernie Sanders has called for government ownership of the means of production.</comment>

<comment>So our military is Un-American?</comment>

<comment>That makes no sense. </comment>

<comment>Um, do we have competing capitalistic militaries in our country? Or do we pool all out money into one military?</comment>

<comment>Having a national military has nothing to do with socialism. </comment>

<comment>So our military is capitalist? Did you buy a missile today?</comment>

<comment>Last I checked there is quite a enormous defense industry. I could buy a drone. </comment>

<comment>Last I checked the military was paid for by pooling our taxes together and there was no competition from other "militaries.">  I could buy a drone.Yes and I can buy a gun, but that doesn't make any of us part of the military, does it?</comment>

<comment>Going round in circles doo doo like a bird up in the sky...</comment>

<comment>Also, our military is part of our government, and isn't our tax funded government socialist?</comment>

<comment>Actually, no. You're describing Communism. Not the same thing, no matter what the yapping liebots at Fox have been telling you. Sorry. Try again.</comment>

<comment>http://i.word.com/idictionary/... description I used matches most general definitions. Be it Websters,  Wiki etc. Sorry you're wrong. </comment>

<comment>Social security?  Military healthcare?</comment>

<comment>Sanders does not advocate for government ownership of the means of production.You need to modernize your thinking here Jack. Sanders is a self-described "Democratic Socialist" and likens himself to the center left parties of northern Europe. A high tax, generous welfare state. Not communism.</comment>

<comment>He asked me to define socialism, which I did correctly.  Sanders describes himself as a Socialist and what brand he takes is of no matter to me. </comment>

<comment>You defined communism.</comment>

<comment>No. Communism is a system wherein each person contributes to a pot and the pot is evenly divided among the citizens, sometimes in accordance to need. In theory.</comment>

<comment>Then call Websters, Wiki and Britannica as well as a hundred other sources as that's how they define it as well.  </comment>

<comment>So you enjoy willful ignorance? This would be like saying there's no difference between a self-identified Rockefeller Republican, paleocon, and neocon because they're all Republicans, despite the fact that each type differs significantly in terms of foreign and domestic policy.</comment>

<comment>No Bernie Sanders is unelectable and I would never support him with my vote. Therefore, I don't care. </comment>

<comment>I wonder -- did you vote for  Mitt Rmoney last time, despite that he was obviously "unelectable?"Or did you vote for the even more blatantly "unelectable" (even within the Publican party) Ron Paul?As no Publican has won the Presidency since '04, it would seem that either you've been voting for "unelectable" candidates, or you've been sitting out the Presidential elections.</comment>

<comment>I did vote for Romney and to say he was unelectable is absurd, especially when you draw comparisons to Sanders.  Please. </comment>

<comment>So why are you spending so much time talking about him?</comment>

<comment>I was only responding as a courtesy and he is the only other candidate. </comment>

<comment>Well, if you want to remain willfully ignorant be my guest. But there is a huge difference between Lenin and the German or Danish  welfare state.</comment>

<comment>That's true: it doesn't matter to you because that would require that you actually think. Realize as a good GOP con, that that is outside your wheelhouse.</comment>

<comment>It's pretty clear that any sort of nuance is beyond you.</comment>

<comment>Not at all.  There are many aspects of daily life that are socialist and are never questioned.  As one example, fires used to be fought by subscription fire companies.  They would sell you a placard that would be displayed by your front door.  If another fire company came, they would let your house burn.  If you had forgotten to renew your subscription, they would let you house burn.  Often these fires got out of control and burned both subscribers and non-subscribers alike.  When cities began to take on firefighting as a municipal obligation, many cried "socialism" and "government control."  But the truth was that this entirely socialist act was necessary for the general welfare.  There are many other institutions that are socialist so it is not really a dirty word.  There are simply some activities that are better undertaken by the federal or state government than by private for-profit firms.</comment>

<comment>All true and yet "socialism" remains a dirty word in the US due to the remaining effects of the cold war. Russians and Chinese are also to some extent anathema. Cuba too. This country has much growing up to do.</comment>

<comment>People routinely confuse state socialism with democratic socialism.  State socialism is really just another name for Communism.  In both those systems the state theoretically holds everything in trust for the people.  But Democratic Socialism is where the government performs certain types of acts at the will of the people.  Social Democrats advocate state ownership when strength (the military), or regulation (the police), or protection (firemen) or education, or, in most countries, public health and welfare.  Very often the Federal government does things because of economies of scale --- where a single focus can promote efficiency, lower cost, or better service.</comment>

<comment>And in all devloped countries have universal healthcare and the cost of healthcare is in average 10-12% while the US pays 18% of GDP with millions of Americans uninsured and many unable to pay for healthcare due to high deductibles.</comment>

<comment>There is even a "super-socialist" movement in WHO to classify key drugs, such as those to treat HIV, vaccinations, Hepatitis C, et al as "essential drugs" and allow their production in developing countries in the generic form.  In one particular Hep C drug, the actual cost is around $1800 to manufacture but  sells for $84,000 for a 12-week course.  This is a primary reason why health care should not be in the hands of for-profit companies.  The drug was developed using 100% taxpayer money (grants from NIH) but the patent was bought out because the developers did not have the "business expertise" to bring it to market.  It would be cheaper for a person with Hep C to travel to India, stay in a luxury hotel for 12 weeks, and receive the treatment than to stay here and let Medicare or insurance pay for it.</comment>

<comment>This is an entirely too rational, accurate and non-hysterical post for this thread. Well done!One nit to pick. Unfortunately the word "socialist" is (unfairly) a dirty word. Just say socialist about anything that you don't like and you've got huge, automatic support, no thought necessary.</comment>

<comment>Thanks.   Instead of the term "socialist" I more often use "social democrat."  But despite most of the rest of the industrialized world being more or less social democratic few Americans seem to know what it means.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention Social Security, Medicare, Unemployment Insurance -- all originally decried as "socialism," and all now not only overwhelmingly popular*, but necessary to the functioning of our society.*to the point that Publicans, even as they try to diminish or destroy these programs, have to pretend that they're "saving them," and claim it's Dem's who are looking to cut them.</comment>

<comment>You mean like the bank bailouts? Or the auto industry bailouts. Jesus Christ. Charles Erwin Wilson once said "What's good for General Motors is good for America." If GM is good enough to get a bail-out ordinary Americans bloody well should. It's about time. If socialism is good enough for Goldman Sachs it's good enough for me.</comment>

<comment>Jd, here are just two (of the many available) data points for you to consider, re:  that "un-American socialism:"1:  Among Americans 18-34, at least two major polls (Gallup was one; I think Pew was another) show that "socialism" now rates more favorably than does "capitalism."Hardly surprising, given how American-style capitalism has treated that generation in particular (though hardly exclusively), but still impressive considering the massive, ubiquitous propaganda against it (such as your little post).2:  Among the social-democratic countries of Europe, almost all of their economies are doing better than ours...AND their citizens overwhelmingly poll as "happier" than ours.Turns out the winner-take-all society that Publicans have spent 35+ years giving us doesn't actually work too well for its constituent citizens.Wotta shock.This being the case, you can expect the needle in that first data-point to keep moving steadily leftward -- and, if we don't actually take action to make the economy more equitable, at an accelerating rate.Cheers</comment>

<comment>It was a two year old pew poll which was proven to be very unrealiable as the year before it showed the opposite results as well as found the young voters didnt understand the term socialism. Gallup has consistently shown American citizens favored capitalism 3 to 1. Liberal Democrats favor socialism but even there the party splits evenly. It's the Obama economy which has soured the youth with a lack of jobs. Nice try-fail. </comment>

<comment>Like, say, roads.  Or sewage systems.  Or air traffic control centers.  Or airports, for cryin' out loud.  Next thing you know, it'll be illegal to drain the cars crankcase over the storm drain....</comment>

<comment>A SOCIALIST!!!   Clutch the pearls and fetch my fainting couch.Newsflash.....every modern nation in the world is socialist to some degree.  The US is no different.</comment>

<comment>In America, the old people keep the socialism for themselves, and they'll vote against anyone who wants to share it.</comment>

<comment>The old people and the corporations keep the socialism and the benefits of government to themselves and tell the rest of the people to stuff it. Only in America.</comment>

<comment>I'm looking forward to the day that grand mothers and grand fathers will vote for Medicare to their children and grand children.</comment>

<comment>Out of all of the criticisms for Clinton you could come up with off the top of your head, you chose "dirty grandma." I guess this also explains why you equate socialism with Un-American, despite our social/economic system being a mixture of capitalist and socialist policies.</comment>

<comment>I chose dirty because the Clinton's play by their own rules and on the borders of legality. Grandma is a spin her camp has thrown out there to soften her image and the Atlantic has written about it often.  Socialism in its pure form is far from the traditions of the United States. </comment>

<comment>What, pray tell, is socialism in its "pure form?" Soviet-style state socialism? Anarcho-communism as in Revolutionary Catalonia or the Ukrainian Free Territory? Social democracy in the Nordic model? Utopian socialism like in New Harmony?Because if socialism is so un-American, then how did the Socialist Party of America manage to put thousands of candidates into various levels of office in the early part of the 20th century? The US likely would have a decently healthy left-wing if not for decades of state repression (First Red Scare, imprisonment and lifetime disenfranchisement of Eugene Debs, Centralia Massacre, etc.), which of course occurred with the happy cooperation of private enterprise (Corporations Auxiliary Company, anyone?).</comment>

<comment>You dislike Hillary - OK. Do you also dislike her politics? And if yes which part?</comment>

<comment>"Socialism in its pure form is far from the traditions of the United States."Right, hence my use of the word "mixture." And this is where your argument falls apart, because to say Sanders' support for economic and social policies that are purely socialist is about as honest (and justifiable) as me saying that Bobby Jindal is a Westboro Baptist Church apologist.</comment>

<comment>He calls himself a socialist therefore he is unelectable. </comment>

<comment>A telephone-answering monkey with a syphilitic donkey as its running mate would make for a better alternative.</comment>

<comment>When Hillary self-immolates, and we know she will, there will be good old Joe to save the day. Joementum!!!!</comment>

<comment>Oh, please, please, please run Joe Biden.</comment>

<comment>OK, but only if you run Ted Cruz.</comment>

<comment>I like Joe Biden. A lot. And I do not want Joe Biden as president.</comment>

<comment>Why not?</comment>

<comment>No mental horsepower.</comment>

<comment>Is your name Eirk Vanderhoff? Just kidding. I like Joe Biden too, and I think the idea about him not being a smart person is mostly fuss and feathers. He's a smart dude.</comment>

<comment>He's not stupid, he just doesn't come across as smart or competent. Appearing to be smart/competent is very important to a high level political candidate.It would be like electing Moe from the 3 stooges. In reality Moe was very smart - but that wasn't the character he played.</comment>

<comment>George W. Bush didn't come across as smart or competent and He was re-elected after launching the Iraq war. I don't think any politician has to appear to be smart or competent. Voters have to like you. People like Joe Biden, he could be president.</comment>

<comment>He is an excellent deal maker for the Senate. He has no real executive experience. As a VP he was a good choice. He might even make a good cabinet member.</comment>

<comment>That makes sense.</comment>

<comment>The '90's are a positive.</comment>

<comment>Unless you just hate peace and prosperity and a balanced budget. Which apparently George Bush did.</comment>

<comment>The Dems have viable candidate who, when the dust settles, will have the United support of her party. The Republican "alternatives" will drive each other further and further right until they are indistinguishable.</comment>

<comment>"Even defeated one-term presidents can boost a relative if they remain popular within their party: Robert Alfonso Taft could plausibly aspire to follow the lead of his father, William Howard Taft; George W. Bush did follow George H.W. Bush."How can you not mention John & John Quincy Adams and William Henry Harrison & Benjamin Harrison?  John and William were both one-term presidents (William being a very one-term president) who had relatives - a son and a grandson, respectively - later become president.</comment>

<comment>William Henry Harrison's special combo of longest inauguration speech/shortest presidency has always been an American history classic. Tippecanoe & Tyler too!</comment>

<comment>Someone who literally did not have sense enough to come in out of the rain.</comment>

<comment>Americans can barely remember Nixon; nobody has an opinion on the Adams or Harrisons</comment>

<comment>It's a scary world when another Bush presidency doesn't seem like the worst of all the options the GOP is offering for 2016.</comment>

<comment>Its even scarier when he appears to be their best, sanest option.</comment>

<comment>Jeb is pretty liable too.  I'm a liberal dem, but as a Floridian, I thought he was a decent gov.  Sure there was the whole Terri Schiavo thing and some far right abortion law efforts, but he seemed quite pragmatic and reasonable.He's trying to go further right now, away from his prior statements on gay marriage and on immigration reform to take a hard line, but I don't really think that is him.He did, also use his own private email address while in public office, so he's got that problem too.</comment>

<comment>Terry Schiavo was pretty far from pragmatic and reasonable, and that was a Jeb Bush operation all the way. Republican opponents may not make an issue of l'affaire Schiavo, but you can be sure Democrats will. It became a national story that most people followed closely, and they were opposed to what Jeb was doing. He will have to answer for that if he becomes the nominee. He will not back down from what he did, and it will hurt him.</comment>

<comment>Even if you belive Jeb is amoderate, he cannot govern in opposition to a Republican congress. Any birth control or abortion law from a Republican Congress will be signed by Jeb.</comment>

<comment>Lie-able?Yes, even among a host of highly lie-able candidates, Jebbie is something of a standout.</comment>

<comment>With the Democrats going all-in for Hillary, the Repubs have a natural advantage this cycle, as Hillary is the weakest and most inept major party candidate we've seen in decades. All the GOP has to do to win this one is not screw up.Nominating Jeb would be the kind of major screw-up that could lose this gift. Turning this election into Clinton Vs. Bush takes away Hillary's negatives and allows her to run on her husband's record (an impressive one) rather than hers (an astonishingly weak one).</comment>

<comment>Just as Republican primary voters really didn't want to nominate Mitt Romney in 2012, so they really don't want to nominate Jeb Bush in 2016. Romney was a mediocre candidate who threw away the issue of Obamacare; Jeb is looking like a mediocre candidate who would throw away the issues of immigration, education, foreign policy and family dynasties.But there is a huge difference this time. Romney was running against so weak a field that all of his opponents wilted under the spotlight, one way or another, even as the voters looked desperately for some "not Romney" candidate who would save them. But this time, the GOP field is full of strong, competent contenders, some of whom have good track records and are excellent campaigners. I really don't think Jeb will be the nominee. I hope not.</comment>

<comment>Well, Republicans are creatures of habit.  Between 1952 and 2004, thirteen out of fourteen Republican tickets included Richard Nixon, Bob Dole or a Bush.  As Bill Clinton famously said, "Democrats fall in love; Republicans fall in line."Which Republican do you believe will be strong enough to upend this cycle's Bush du jour?</comment>

<comment>As Bill Clinton famously said, "Democrats fall in love; Republicans fall in line."That's what makes this cycle so odd. The Republicans are acting like Democrats, while the Democrats are acting like Republicans.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans are acting like ideologues, while the Democrats are acting like reasonable people.</comment>

<comment>So you are admitting that usually it's the other way around? ;-)</comment>

<comment>The present is unlike the past in that there are more billionaires interested in running the country, and the law allows them to spend essentially unlimited amounts of money to elect their preferred candidates. In particular, the Koch Brothers and their allied plutocrats have put together a political machine that has been highly successful in the states, and they may just be ready to put their preferred candidate (Scott Walker), if not in the Oval Office, in the position of nominee of the Republican Party for president. They can certainly match the Bush machine in money and organizational skills.</comment>

<comment>It's too early to tell; the sitting governors haven't declared yet. But Walker and Rubio are looking strong. Rubio is inexperienced, but he is a brilliant communicator, the best of the field.</comment>

<comment>How is Clinton's record impressive?  His signature domestic accomplishment was welfare reform.  That infuriated progressives and led to the rise of Ralph Nader.</comment>

<comment>I judge presidents by how effective they are at slowing the growth of the government, since the #1 problem in America is a large, burdensome, intrusive government that slows economic growth and turns society into a lottery where plutocrats connected to the government gravy train win at the rest of our expense.By that measure, I think Clinton was the best president during my lifetime, even if he was just an actor in a larger play that included Newt Gingrinch, Robert Rubin (who pushed hard on Clinton to shrink the deficit and reap the rewards of a healthy bond market), and an end to the Cold War that allowed a slowdown in military spending growth.During the Clinton presidency, government grew less quickly than it did under any president since Coolidge, and America reaped the economic rewards. So yes, even though he may have wanted to govern as a liberal, and even though his presidency was scandal-ridden, and even though he's dishonest and philandering and has multiple women who have accused him of rape or attempted rape, his record as president is still a good one.</comment>

<comment>Why not give credit to Donald Trump in that case?

<comment>I think that Bill Clinton gets some credit for slowing the growth of government. He and the Gingrich Congress fought and fought, with Clinton wanting more spending and Congress wanting less, but in the end, it was Clinton who signed the spending bills that were far less aggressive in terms of spending increases than those of his predecessors. And, to hear Carville's take on it, Clinton had a kind of come-to-Jesus moment when Robert Rubin convinced him the bond market would reward him politically if he held the line on spending. Clinton may have come into the White House talking a liberal game, but the guy was a pragmatist whose only purpose in life was self-aggrandizement. When it became clear to him that less spending equaled prosperity, and prosperity equalled happy voters and a positive legacy, whatever ideology he ran on went out the window.Would Hillary be the same? I don't think so. She's always been the more liberal and ideological of the two, and right now the Democratic base is demanding a pretty hard line socialism from their candidates.And so, what we have is a woman who can benefit from her husband's record, even though she isn't running on what made the record happen, and wouldn't implement the policies that made it all work. And in the wildest irony of all, if she ran against Bush, she would be putting her family's small government legacy against the failed big government legacy of GW.</comment>

<comment>First of all, government growth has been consistently lower in recent decades compared to the past for multiple administrations.  Why?  Because the American people are fundamentally distrustful of government.  How many tax increases has Obama been able to get out the door.  Giving Bill Clinton credit for that makes zero sense.  His great innovation was triangulation.  Are we really going to give somebody kudos for slavish devotion to public opinion polls?  That view devalues leadership to the point of complete inconsequence.I would also point out that government spending under Bush increased primarily due to the war, and that in itself is not too surprising.</comment>

<comment>Big Gubmint, if it is an issue, is much, much less important that large numbers of other issues that are also much more fundamental such as immigration and trade. Immigration, for instance, decides who lives in the U.S. and who votes.</comment>

<comment>If that's your primary criterion of Presidential value, you should love Obama, who has increased federal spending less than any other President of the last half-century*.Of course, we haven't all reaped those "economic rewards" that your theory says should be attendant on this...*Source:  those well-known loony-lib com-symps at Forbes:http://www.forbes.com/sites/ri...</comment>

<comment>Obama has increased federal spending less than any president starting from a baseline of record federal spending when GW Bush left office.That's an important distinction.If Cheech eats one hot dog a day, and then he eats two, he has doubled his hot dog consumption, but he'll probably be alright because it's just two hot dogs.If Chong eats ten hot dogs a day and then he eats fifteen, he has only increased his hot dog consumption by 50%, but now he is eating 15 hot dogs a day.Chong isn't going to be as healthy as Cheech, even though he increased his hot dog consumption less than Cheech did.</comment>

<comment>Jeb Bush will be the nominee for two reasons. Money and the media. Primary season is like running a marathon. It's a long race and you have to make it all the way to the end. But in order to do that, you need money and lots of it. Bush, despite his weak poll numbers and lackluster campaign skills, isn't hurting for money. The big donors have already lined up for him and will continue to fund him. The other Republican candidates each have a sugar daddy, but beyond that they don't have a lot of money pouring in. And unless they do well in Iowa and New Hampshire, they'll run out of money and be forced to drop out. Jeb isn't even competing in Iowa. Why waste money in a state you can't win and risk an embarrassing second or third place showing? He's taking the long view.The second reason Jeb will be the Republican nominee is because the corporate media wants him to be, the same way they want Hillary to be the Democratic nominee. For all the talk about political bias in the media, the one bias that should be obvious is a corporate one. Presidential election season is great for ratings. And having Jeb and Hillary as the nominees gives the media far more material to work with. Not only will they get to talk endlessly about the two candidates, they'll also get to revisit all the drama with the Bush family and the Clintons. An election season where you get to talk not only about Jeb and Hillary, but also W and Bubba? That's what the political pundit class dreams of. As for why the media isn't already promoting Jeb now, that's easy. They want a horse race. What fun is covering primary season if the nominees have been decided before the first debate? Why do you think the media is constantly talking about Elizabeth Warren getting in the race? Because it's no fun to cover the Democratic side if the only real candidate is Hillary. That's why 2008 was so much fun for the media. We had a neck-and-neck race between Obama and Hillary. On the Republican side, McCain locked up the nomination by February. Yawn. The media will give Jeb a hard time, but they don't want him to drop out.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget that the television networks don't budget for an extended primary season involving multiple candidates.  I look for the Republican contest to come down to Jeb Bush versus a single non-Bush by the end of March, with the focus early on several candidates competing to be the last on-Bush standing.Since the calendar is frontloaded with Southern state primaries during February and early March, I surmise that the surviving non-Bush candidate will be a culture warrior.</comment>

<comment>Culture warriors rarely make it that far. My prediction is that it'll come down to Bush and Scott Walker. The media would've loved to see Christie Cream too, but bridgegate killed his chances.</comment>

<comment>Well, the last remaining challenger to McCain in 2008 was Mike Huckabee, and the last challenger to Romney in 2012 was Santorum.In each case, the eventual nominee was so far ahead by then that it didn't matter.  In Senator McCain's case, though, that was fortuitous.  Going into the 2008 South Carolina primary, McCain was on the ropes, and his victory there revived his flagging campaign.  Governor Huckabee ran a close second.  Fred Thompson finished a distant third, whereupon he withdrew from the race.  If Senator Thompson (who was personally close to McCain)  had pulled out earlier, Huckabee would likely have won that primary, and McCain would have been wounded.</comment>

<comment>The point is that the culture warrior was nowhere close to the frontrunner. At that point, they were just in the race to get their message out and force the eventual nominee to take more conservative positions on social issues. But what the media wants is a real horse race. The Clinton/Obama race was too good to be true for the media.</comment>

<comment>I wonder whether and to what extent the upcoming SCOTUS decision on same sex marriage will discombobulate the Republican primary contest.  At least two candidates, Huckabee and Carson, have suggested that they will not regard a decision in favor of SSM as binding on the President. (What a President can actually do about that is sketchier.)Jeb Bush's position has been that SSM should be decided on a state by state basis -- a position that many Republicans will regard as squishy.  I would not be terribly surprised to see a third party effort based on culture war issues, in the tradition of Strom Thurmond in 1948 and George Wallace in 1968, both fueled by a backlash against racial desegregation.  This becomes more likely if a Daddy Culture Warbucks (Foster Friess?) is willing to spend some money in support.That would put in play some states that would otherwise not be competitive, such as Georgia and Arkansas, and would shore up Democratic prospects in battleground states such as North Carolina, Florida, Virginia and Ohio.</comment>

<comment>I doubt you'd see a third party effort. Instead, I think you'll just see more "religious freedom" laws like what we saw in Indiana. And given the strong backlash Mike Pence received from big corporations, some red state governors may not want to go down that road. But don't underestimate the conservatives when it comes to finding creative ways to push back against laws they don't like. They didn't like it when blacks got the right to vote. So now they're just passing voter ID laws to keep black people from voting. When it comes to gay rights, conservatives will simply play the religion card to get away with discriminating against gays.</comment>

<comment>Dear Ann Richardson said it best when she observed (about HW but even more so with JEB) "born on second base and thinks he hit a double" (or was that third...)</comment>

<comment>It was third base and a triple.  And Jeb's recent performance reminds one of another comment from Governor Richards about Papa Bush:  "He can't help it.  He was born with a silver foot in his mouth."</comment>

<comment>But Jeb isn't running for president; he's running for president IF he is running for president. Got it?</comment>

<comment>Donors do realize that if he doesn't actually declare for president, that donated money is essentially his to play around with, right?</comment>

<comment>Stop telling lies, Erik...it's in the Super PAC lockbox!</comment>

<comment>Didn't Ben Carson admit he has going to do this for money?</comment>

<comment>The Democrativ candidate least equipped to attack Bush for his baggage is Hillary Clinton.  </comment>

<comment>And vice versa.</comment>

<comment>I call it a draw.  Just pointing out that Bush would not be the only candidate with baggage.  And his load might actually be the lighter one.</comment>

<comment>But as Frum notes, Bush isn't able to launch the kind of attacks against Clinton that would be most effective, because many of those criticisms could be said about him. The GOP would be better off with a candidate who is able to draw distinctions between themselves and Clinton.</comment>

<comment>That's a drawback, yes.  But other candidates don't speak fluent Spanish.  They don't have successful tenures as governor in their resume.  They don't have reputations as thoughtful moderates.Any candidate has drawbacks.  Any complete picture however must examine their strengths as well.</comment>

<comment>But the media could attack Jeb for her. The Democrat candidate only has to run against the Republican candidate; but the Republican must beat the Democrat and the media.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the media has totally ignored all of the Whitewater stuff, right?  And the Clinton email server.Political affiliation aside a lot of the professional press corps has a personal dislike for Clinton.</comment>

<comment>And a love for ratings and scintillating stories.</comment>

<comment>Wasn't John Edwards' mistress and love child a scintillating story? So how come only the National Enquirer covered it, while the NYT ran a 5,000 word front page story over rumors that McCain had had an affair with a lobbyist eight years previously (both parties denied it and there was no proof)?If all you read is the NYT, you only learned of Edwards' affair after he was forced to confess to it..</comment>

<comment>The Whitewater stuff was 20 years ago, when the media only leaned left. Then came Obama and the Great Dive into the Tank for him.I suspect the grief Hillary is taking now is a function of two things 1) she is making it impossible for the press to report anything, which they need to do; very unskillful handling and 2) the Obama White House is mad at Hillary so is not lifting a finger to help her.</comment>

<comment>Obama is a special case, and Hillary is not going to be able to ride on his coat tails.I would guess that the media is going to crucify her for all of the issues that they gave Obama a pass on.</comment>

<comment>Oh boo hoo.  The Big Bad Liberal Media.The "media" looks for attention-getting stories that play well in a quick 24 hours news cycle.  Their first and last interest is ratings.  They will not bother to bore their audience with any genuinely substantive review of the canddiates' positions and experience.  They are looking for flubs, scandals and "gotcha!" moments from everbody, and they've (rightfully) been covering Hillary's endless sleaze just fine.</comment>

<comment>No, that's just it. The media cares about ideology more than ratings. Just look at how Fox is beating all its cable competition combined -- for years now.If all MSNBC cared about was ratings, they would have imported a whole bunch of conservative talkers to mix it up and woo Fox's audience. Yet instead they go further and further left, even though their ratings are in the toilet.</comment>

<comment>Disagree- Walker is not only much more likely to win the R nomination than Jeb, he'll be a much more dangerous general election candidate than Jeb, especially against Hillary. Underestimating Walker has cost WI Dems badly (not to mention the cost to the Koch Industries mid-western subsidiary formerly known as the state of Wisconsin).</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Scott Walker won three elections in four years in the blue state of WI. That's not the record of someone who comes across as a radical right-winger.</comment>

<comment>I agree that Scott Walker has some political skills. Just yesterday I saw him string together several intelligent sentences on a national issue, something he could not do a month ago. But he will still have to adhere to the wishes of the Republican establishment (Koch Brothers and friends version) and Christian conservatives. I also believe his current position on immigration is hard-line, which even Republican operatives regard as a loser in the presidential general election. That said, I have thought for years that he would emerge as the Republican nominee for president in 2016. I still think so, but the situation is fluid.</comment>

<comment>The Koch Brothers are libertarians, not part of the GOP Establishment. Try to get the players straight.</comment>

<comment>Whatever one-word label you apply to them, they are the guys with money enough to effectively take over the Republican party, and increasingly the political organization to do so. They want a government that serves their interests. They are businessmen, not hobbyists.</comment>

<comment>But he won all of those in non presidential election yeas, and is deeply unpopular in his state. You can bet the farm on him if you like, but so far he appears to have limited appeal.</comment>

<comment>Scooter's popularity has slipped to negative in Wisconsin and HRC beats him in matchup polls ALREADY...so take those low-turnout election results you guys constantly lean on and throw 'em into the dust bin of political history.</comment>

<comment>National head to head polls 18 months out are an exercise in name recognition, little more. Most people in the country don't even know who Scott Walker is yet. But everybody knows Hillary Clinton. That being the case, the fact that Clinton leads Walker by 6 or 10 points (the last two polls) should not be a big comfort to her supporters.</comment>

<comment>Walker isn't that exciting, sorry to say, and quite frankly his record isn't all that impressive once you start peeling back the onion. The GOP can do better.</comment>

<comment>This article so blatantly a smear article that I wouldn't be surprised if it were written by Clinton's campaign staff.  Sounds like the author switched parties sometime in the last 13 years :P  Come on Atlantic... journalism means BALANCE.</comment>

<comment>Turns out, it was written by a former Bush speechwriter! Who knew! (Most of the rest of us.)</comment>

<comment>Hence why I said "sounds like the author switched parties sometime in the last 13 years".</comment>

<comment>"This article is so biased I wouldn't be surprised if it were written by Clinton's campaign staff. Come on Atlantic... journalism means BALANCE."This is your entire post. Ah...I see you threw an edit in.</comment>

<comment>I did.  Before you commented on it, because I realized it might come off that I didn't realize the author had worked on the Republican side 13 years ago.  My point still stands.</comment>

<comment>Your point was that journalism must have balance, yes? I suppose your point stands, I'm just not sure it's applicable. Because I'm not sure this would be considered "journalism." Assuming we're still talking about the Frum piece and not The Atlantic writ large.</comment>

<comment>"Balance" only means "sucking up to Republicans" to Republicans. Most of the rest of us don't care about your feelings. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>No, balance means providing positives and negatives for both sides.  If a publication rarely provides positives for one side, but consistently provides them for the other, they are biased.  As an example, National Review is biased conservative, while Salon is biased liberal, etc...  The atlantic used to claim to be balanced, but in the past 5 or 6 years, it has gradually shifted to become less balanced and more biased.</comment>

<comment>The author of this piece wrote speeches for GWB.  He self-identifies as a Republican and conservative.  He has no desire whatsoever to help the Democrats win the WH.  He is pointing out the weaknesses of one GOP candidate should he win the nomination and have to run against the current Democratic front runner.  Whatever the authors bias, it isn't that he leans Liberal or supports Democratic candidates.</comment>

<comment>And it is within his rights to write such an article.  What is amusing is the Atlantic still attempting to portray itself as a neutral commentary source when the vast majority of its articles are left leaning.</comment>

<comment>Your claim was that this particular author did a hit piece because he's somehow biased against conservatives.</comment>

<comment>Where do you see Atlantic trying to portray itself as anything in particular? You may confuse "neutral" with analytical. They aren't the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Respectfully disagree. It is quite clear to non-conservatives that conservatism, taking the Republican Party with it, has dramatically shifted to the right over time, especially since Obama's election. It may seem to conservatives that non-conservatives have shifted left- but the opposite has happened. Conservatism has become more extreme- the rest of us haven't.</comment>

<comment>I would definitely agree that the GOP has shifted to the right in the past 15 years.  That said, I would say the same for the DNC.  Bill Clinton's policies when he was president would never pass in the Democratic party of 2015.  Both parties have become substantially more extreme since the 1990s.</comment>

<comment>The author could have saved us all some time by printing the following:  "Jeb Bush is bad because his brother is bad."  I'm not a supporter of Jeb Bush, but I am disappointed in this article, as it is singularly unhelpful in evaluating the man who may or may not be running for President... as opposed to his family members, who already have run and succeeded, 3 out of 5 times they tried (the exceptions being George HW Bush's failed bids in 1980 and 1992). Even if the sins of the father and brother were relevant, then (and they're not; not really) it makes one question just how much of a liability Jeb finds in his family.But enough about that.  What about Jeb Bush himself?  What about the fact that his handpicked successor as Governor of Florida changed parties, lost a Senatorial race against one of Jeb's presumptive opponents for the GOP nomination, and failed to win back the Governor's seat against a very unpopular Republican incumbent?  Surely that says a lot more about Jeb's own sphere of political influence than do the opinions about his father and brother?  Again, I'm not saying Jeb is an impeccable candidate.  I'm saying we wouldn't know that he's not, reading this article.</comment>

<comment>He has surrounded himself with the same FP team as his brother.  A team that made up lies to justify a war that we have lost more than once.  Clearly that is proof that he is far from impeccable.</comment>

<comment>A reasonable analysis of Jeb's problems, but you can also write an analysis of every other likely or announced Republican candidate and they would all be lacking. As are Clinton O'Malley, or Sanders on the Democratic side.The problem with this sort of analysis is we don't vote for or against a candidate weighed against the ideal in our heads. We vote based on what the other choices are. In a leaky armada, the large and well appointed Bush ship may be the least leaky one the Republicans have to choose.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. A leaky canoe that one.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is the worst possible candidate for pres from either party, except for all the others.</comment>

<comment>Frum repeatedly refers to the "Clinton family" but the only Clinton family is see is Bill and Hillary; Chelsea appears to have no interest in political office.The Bush family, on the other hand, extends back to Senator Prescott Bush, father of George H.W. Bush and grandfather of George W Bush and his brother Jeb.All this political dynasty stuff is nothing more than the same, stale exercise in false equivalency that delights our chattering class.</comment>

<comment>I think Frum is using "Clinton family" in the same sense as "Gambino family" or "Genovese family."</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Bill made his own fortune, and sure, Hillary may be riding his coattails. But she came from a political family and was well poised to enter politics independent of bill. Bushes seem to be riding the coattails of family way more. Fourth attempt at national office! Sounds more like the kennedys...</comment>

<comment>Jeb Bush has other problems that are not being discussed at all.1)  Jeb's (and his father's) role in the Iran Contra Affair iss being omitted from the discussion.  According to immunized Congressional testimony, GHW Bush was the "project manager" and Jeb was the "money man in Mexico."  Remember that sordid affair?  Reagan illegally sold Iran missiles, aircraft parts and Hawk upgrades in return for Iran keeping the hostages until after the election.  Poindexter and North siphoned off considerable cash for their own enrichment.  The rest went to Jeb who actually gave the cash to the Contras.  The Contras used the money to buy cocaine to sell in the USA.  The money from drug sales was then used to buy arms to attempt to overthrow a democratically elected government. GHW Bush, as one of his last acts in office, pardoned all involved whether indicted or not indicted.  It is the only time a President has ever pardoned himself.2)  Jeb's involvement in the Savings and Loan Scandal has never been fully discussed.  Jeb's brother, Neil, and sister-in-law got little more than a slap on the wrist while the taxpayer picked up a $1.3 BILLION dollar tab.  GHW Bush and Jeb were both involved with Silverado even while GHW was Vice-President.3)  While Jeb was governor of Florida, Jeb's wife, Columba, was arrested for felony smuggling at the Miami airport.  Mysteriously she was not detained or indicted and punished, presumably because of Jeb's political influence.</comment>

<comment>I quit reading at this line: "Barring some rip in the space-time continuum, Hillary Clinton will be the Democratic nominee in 2016." Perhaps if the media would report on other democratic candidates as equally as they do Hillary, those who vote to make the decision for the democratic nomination would consider other options. Sanders is an incredible, unique choice for the democratic ticket. There are many democrats who lean much further left than Hillary and will vote accordingly.</comment>

<comment>Hilary Clinton's latest ideas on immigration, universal pre-k, universal after-school, paid sick time, and taxes on hedge fund managers is pretty liberal.  She's moving leftward, and she will win, absent "some rip in the space-time continuum."</comment>

<comment>I know what you're saying, but the idea "Clinton is the frontrunner" is supported by the current state-of-affairs, so blaming the media is somewhat about blaming the messenger.</comment>

<comment>As for the 'can't attack his opponent [Clinton] because he's too similar' argument, is that not precisely what the major funders of these campaigns want? Entrenched industries and the financially powerful people who run them don't particularly care if the sitting president is a Republican or a Democrat--they just want a vanilla, middle-of-the-road, pushover moderate when it comes to financial regulation, trade, and corporate influence in politics so that they can keep the gravy train a-rollin'. If you have both candidates in your pocket to some degree, who cares who wins?As a rank-and-file Republican or Democrat, you may care about nominating the most viable candidate for your party who you and your fellow party members also align with on a range of social, economic, and foreign affairs issues; but rest assured, the people and organizations who donate the vast majority of the funding for these candidates do not--they're just hedging their bets in such a way that they always come out on top, regardless of which party nominee ultimately wins the general election.</comment>

<comment>Leaning more left than right here, I sit dazed and confused. Will someone please give me a reason to vote for Hiliary ... other than being the lesser of two evils. Not only hasn't she accomplished anything of substance during all of her positions, she's arrogant, loyal to the 1%, untrustworthy, and selfish. No thanks! But, then I look at the other side and the Repubs have absolutely no one of any substance. They're all worthless slaves to the 1%. I'll write in Bernie if he's not on the ballot in this state ... he might be a "democratic socialist" but I find his talking points closer to my opinions. The only problem is that while I agree with his economic and social issues, I don't know anything about his foreign policy, or if he even has one? All I ever hear him talk about is against wall street, for free education, against PAC's,etc. Where does he stand on the illegal immigrant issue? Or, the Middle East? Regardless, he has enough stances that I agree with to vote for him over Hiliary, or any Repub for that matter.</comment>

<comment>A reason to vote for Hillary: the Supreme Court, unless of course you like Scalia, Allito and Thomas.</comment>

<comment>Good point, Peter! The score is 1-0.</comment>

<comment>Assuming Hil makes it through the primary, which all signs say she will, you vote for the lesser of 2 evils because the other evil is quite extreme. The last time we had this conversation was in 2000 when Bush vs Gore looked like tweedle dum and dee, only tweedle dum turned out to be a catastrophe we are still digging out from underSo if you are left of center, don't let the not so perfect (Clinton) be the enemy of the sane, so to speak.</comment>

<comment>I left the Green Party 20 years ago....there are none worth voting for.  Coronating a Queen is better than The Cons.</comment>

<comment>Isn't it mostly about electing the lesser of two evils. Those who are truly different from the mainstream of center-left and center-right are just un-electable. They lack the finances, grassroots support, organizational depth, and nationwide infrastructure to plausibly win the presidency. I am talking about the socialist Bernie Sanders and the libertarian Rand Paul, or a decade or so the consumer activist Ralph Nader or the billionaire Ross Perot. The best these individuals can do is act as a spoiler for one side or the other. You will have to do what most voters do stay home (which is a vote in itself) or hold your nose and vote for the lesser evil as you perceive it to be.</comment>

<comment>Everyone calls Bernie a "socialist" because he's against Wall Street, and for leveling the playing field with the rich vs the rest of us. If that makes me a socialist then so be it ... label me too. All that I know is that he makes more sense, and will take a stand and be honest and straightforward about it. He's getting my vote unless the Dems put Elizabeth Warren on the ticket at the top. I just can't pull the lever for Hiliary, or any of the Repubs. I feel an obligation to vote, so go Bernie! Peter's comment about the Supreme Court nominees does make me concerned, tho.</comment>

<comment>FYI - I love Bernie Sanders, but people call him a "Socialist" because he describes himself a "Democratic Socialist" in the European tradition.  He ran for office as an Independent not a Democrat.  He likes a strong democracy and a substantive social safety net among other things.</comment>

<comment>That's why its the lesser of evil rule. If you are on the left or far left, Hillary Clinton might make you ill in the stomach but imagine a right-wing or far right politician in the White House. Imagine what will happen in the federal court system due to his or her appointees and what happens in the Supreme Court if any member dies or retires. Not to mention the extremely high possibility about going all neocon overseas and starting new wars or Cold War 2.0 with China or Russia (or maybe both).</comment>

<comment>A reason to vote for Hillary?Can you say Justice Santorum, Mr. concern troll?</comment>

<comment>This is going to be an ugly, entertaining election.</comment>

<comment>per usual</comment>

<comment>Lets add scary to that. Lots on the line for both sides and what remains of the middle.</comment>

<comment>It seems that what advantage in recognition that the "Bush" name has is negated by limits in intelligence.</comment>

<comment>Repeating the automatic claim that Bush (or Obama, other Bush, Hillary, whoever) is an idiot simply shows that your political knowledge is based on catch phrases instead of any real depth or knowledge.</comment>

<comment>No one could accuse HW of low intelligence. But those charges are easily lobbed at Reagan and W</comment>

<comment>JEB doesn't have quite the political baggage (or sinking popularity) of 'Scooter' Walker, who currently loses to HRC in polling IN HIS OWN STATE. That being said, JEB has his own set of 'splainin' to do about Iran-Contra involvement (as 'money man in Mexico' working for Pops) and S&L Crisis monkey business that left taxpayers on the hook for a cool 1.3 bil...in cahoots with his seldom-mentioned brother Neil, that would be. Those email-fixated newspapers need to get off the Lazy Journalism trip and take a good look at the aforementioned, if they want a real story.</comment>

<comment>That Jeb! What a schleb!That Scooter! What a pooter!</comment>

<comment>I predict Michelle Obama will run for the Senate in 4 years, then for the office of POTUS in 10 years.  She has a lot less baggage than Hillary.</comment>

<comment>If 2016 ends up Bush vs. Clinton, I shall flee for South America before it's too late. George W. Bush did more damage to American prosperity and created more international problems than any other president in history ...</comment>

<comment>Jeb is the GOP establishment elite favorite, but the worst possible candidate.  The base hates him, and I can't believe he could possibly win.</comment>

<comment>But no one the base likes could probably win either ;)</comment>

<comment>Good article.</comment>

<comment>America will be doomed if we have another Bush or Clinton in the White House.</comment>

<comment>Given the nightmare ( and that's being polite ) that American politics has become on the Executive and especially the Legislative levels, I'd say doomed no matter which way.</comment>

<comment>I have no doubt that if Jeb is the GOP nominee, the Dem candidate will be able to waltz into the White House and our long national nightmare will continue.To a person, every GOPer I know has stated categorically that they will NOT vote for Jeb Bush under any circumstances. I can't argue with them, since I feel the same way.</comment>

<comment>We had the pragmatic HW, the disastrous Dubya and now no possibility for another pragmatic Bush? Too bad.</comment>

<comment>Jeb's policies are much like W's, including immigration and foreign policy. Hardly pragmatic. Jeb is dogmatically averse to government spending, unlike W but hardly pragmatic.</comment>

<comment>Two words: Common Core. That alone will sink him.</comment>

<comment>I like the cut of his jib. He doesn't look quite as blankly stooooo-pud as his vacuum-tube-headed brother. I certainly won't be misunderestimating Jeb!</comment>

<comment>HRC as the Dem's fait accompli? Almost makes me wish that Bernie had a dark cabal quietly tugging the strings from the shadows. Oh. Sorry. Forgot this was about what's-his-name.</comment>

<comment>The image of a dark cabal of powerful Vermont liberals pulling the strings to control America did draw a grin. Instead of black helicopters, beware of the sinister fleet of aging Volvos and Subarus. </comment>

<comment>If it comes down to Jeb vs Hillary, I'm staying home.</comment>

<comment>How mature.</comment>

<comment>What's the difference between the two?</comment>

<comment>Clinton is mostly liberal; Bush is mostly conservative. For example, Bush can be counted to appoint Supreme Court justices like Scalia and Alito; Clinton will appoint justices like Ginsburg and Kagan.</comment>

<comment>Get the fainting couch ready ladies. We don't like Jeb because he is too liberal. "Liberalism" is just the con to get the young and the stupid to elect some dirtbag into a position of power so they can steal. Look at you idiots, ready to elect some old hag that is running her campaign with bribe money. Go ahead, start your squealing.</comment>

<comment>I know we should all bash the Clintons for making money. But they don't come from big money like the Bushes, Cheneys and Romneys do and I refuse to blame them for trying to catch up by cashing in on the opportunities their own efforts have earned for them. When did George W. and Jeb Bush ever earn anything?</comment>

<comment>The Clintons are "making" money from BRIBES from foreign governments you dolt.</comment>

<comment>OK. You dislike the Clintons. Now, do you have anything relevant and verifiable to add to the discussion?</comment>

<comment>Should we talk about the color of her shoes? Idiot.</comment>

<comment>W probably did the same.</comment>

<comment>No, it's obvious he did not. There is a reason that the U.S. became the richest most powerful country on earth. It's not because we "bribed" our way into greatness. Understand this simple honest statement.</comment>

<comment>W became a 'success' in private enterprise because the Texas Rangers hired him, after several businesses he started using family and friends' money failed, to use his last name, family political connections and family popularity to get the people of Dallas to build the Rangers a new stadium on the taxpayer's dime. That turned the Rangers from an also-ran to one of the most profitable teams in all of baseball. That was Dubya's one and only successful enterprise before becoming Governor.</comment>

<comment>What was Obama's success? How about Hillary? Let's hear about their glorious past.</comment>
