<comment>But I thought she was talking about bananas.</comment>

<comment>Great point.  My question is this:  does the Atlantic understand the harm to its reputation done by running a whine disguised as a thought-piece?</comment>

<comment>Yes, more and more. The Atlantic was once (in my opinion) one of the most respectable publications out there - exciting, fiercely independent and printing truly excellent and thought-provoking articles. You weren't required to agree with any of it, but they were always excellent reads.Then there were the not-so-good years, where they started to become exactly what you're describing - poorly written, poorly researched  shallow gripes were depressingly routine. But honestly, they never completely went over like, say, Salon did. And they're getting better and better again. I think they're banking on there being a space for a real news magazine, with actual journalistic standards and everything. Once they finally fire Rose Eveleth I think they'll have permanently turned a corner.</comment>

<comment>The irony is the Bahn mi, one of the foods that created this uproar, is a sandwich created by either the Vietnamese appropriating French bread to make a delicious fusion sandwich or the French appropriating delicious Vietnamese ingredients to make a delicious fusion sandwich. Basically, the cultures' cuisine's merged, something that wouldn't have happened if people were worried about offending eaters' sensibilities.Culture is cultural appropriation, period.The blues came by the descendants of African slaves appropriating the guitar. Rock 'n' roll came from people appropriating the blues and fusing it with country bluegrass.Life without cultural appropriation would be pretty boring. Without it, say goodbye to rock, the iPhone, and virtually everything you value that was the result of great minds from disparate cultures coming together.</comment>

<comment>Oh you make it sound so innocent. Like people are just getting along and having a good time and grooving on each other's culinary talents.But I know it can't be that much fun. It's got to be bad. These are white people you're talking about. If they're involved, they must be oppressing someone. And this is Vietnam you're talking about. Yes, technically they're the winner of the Vietnam war and thus technically a dominant country that might be considered an oppressor of the French and the US. But it just doesn't fit the narrative to let them win. It's better to make the US seem superior by claiming it's oppressing someone. Only superior folks can oppress, you know.</comment>

<comment>I can't tell if you're parodying people or being serious...</comment>

<comment>Parody, for sure, and not bad at that.</comment>

<comment>No, it's pretty bad.</comment>

<comment>Poe's Law</comment>

<comment>Or the French "appropriating" all of Vietnam, thus introducing the baguettes necessary for banh mi.History is almost universally sordid, and no one's culture is sacrosanct, especially when we're just talking about food. People really need to calm down.</comment>

<comment>"Or making naked snow angels."Why is this bad?    If we don't have students making making naked snow angels when they're still young and beautiful, who the hell is going to make them?Seriously, what is in any sense bad about making naked snow angels?</comment>

<comment>You are asking a person who chose Latin American Studies as a major, god only knows or cares why and how these ideas come into her head.</comment>

<comment>No one in the US has any interests in Latin America whether they be political or economic, Right?  Why should anyone in this country know anything about the place let alone be an expert?  Someone seems foolish.  Not the author.</comment>

<comment>I think there's a significant, though some may say slight, distinction between someone who has a major in Latin-American studies, and someone that has a major in History with a focus on Latin-American history.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure.  It likely only matters if you're trying to become an academic.</comment>

<comment>First of all, angels were invented by a European religion and anything Euros do is oppressive.Second, angels are white. Need I say more?Third, snow is white.

<comment>I agree that the direct harm from these protests is pretty limited, but for me the Oberlin protest crystallized the lack of awareness of costs and trade-offs I see from these kids. Do a budget guys. Decide which poor kids should have their financial aid reduced so that there can be fresh fish in the sushi. Pick what professor positions will be replaced by adjuncts so that there can be more administrators for “outreach” or for preemptive approval of frat party themes. The Fair-trade bananas might well have been worth it in the grand utility calculation, but if you refuse to even acknowledge the existence of trade-offs, don't expect me to take you seriously and please don't aspire to any position of real power.The other problem is that when people throw around allegations of cultural insensitivity or racism in arguments over mediocre dorm food, it makes people ignore such allegations in the context of say, an actual bigot polling 40% in the Republican primary. Much the same way that Republicans have thrown around the word "socialism" until it is completely detoxified, the left is doing the same for "racism" and "sexism". This is not good.</comment>

<comment>Tell the dozens of black businessmen and athletes who are personal friends of Trump and are now standing behind him how much of a racist he is.</comment>

<comment>Oh, they know better than any of us.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, and what are they saying?   When Al-racebait-Sharpton refuses to call someone racist... pretty telling</comment>

<comment>Refuses is an entirely too strong of a noun, and your reading of his position is absolutely incorrect : Mr. Sharpton said he did not know whether Mr. Trump was racist, adding, “I don’t think it matters.”“What he’s saying appeals to racists,” Mr. Sharpton said. “He’s too smart to not know what he’s doing.” --Haberman, Maggie & Eder, Steven.  "Rise of Donald Trump Divides Black Celebrities He Calls His Friends."  New York Times, 12/21/2015.</comment>

<comment>Al Sharpton not out right calling someone racist might as well be him saying they aren't. The man jumps on anyone and anything as racist if he even get's a whiff of racism from it.</comment>

<comment>“What he’s saying appeals to racists...he's too smart not to know what he's doing."Al Sharpton says that Donald Trump is saying racist things and he knows he's doing it.  It doesn't matter to Mr. Sharpton if Mr. Trump is an actual racist or merely a craven opportunist.  Whatever his motivation, he is doing a bad thing.</comment>

<comment>Fine, I changed "racist" to "bigot", since Muslims and Mexicans aren't races. You happy?</comment>

<comment>Oberlin doesn't hire adjuncts, and it hasn't had fraternities or sororities since the 1890s.</comment>

<comment>I was referring to the student protests more broadly. "The frat-parties approval" remark referred to a demand at UCLA.</comment>

<comment>Then perhaps you should've mentioned UCLA, which, among other things, has 40,000 more students than Oberlin, whose students would appear to be the object of your suggestions. I get the distinction you're making vis-à-vis Trump - after all, my mom witnessed a lynching in the South as a young girl. I just don't think you read the article very carefully, and it seems that roughly half of the commenters here haven't read it at all.</comment>

<comment>"Why isn't there fresh fish in my sushi?!?"...Six months later..."Why is my tuition so high?!?  Student loans!  Raaaghghrhrhghh!!"Repeat ad nauseam.</comment>

<comment>The basic premise of the students' protest in this case - that a poorly made ethnic food item in some way is an assault upon students from that cultural group is absolute nonsense.   When you live in a multi-ethnic country like this, things are going to get mixed.  Nobody owns your culturally appropriate recipe for banh mi (which is, after all a Vietnamese repurposing of French cuisine to start with), and there's nothing sinister or wrong in that.   It's just what happens.I have no issue with students protesting - it's good practice for being an adult with actual responsibilities, but jeez kids, find something to protest that actually makes some kind of sense.</comment>

<comment>Serving beef for Diwali is the one genuinely offensive thing.  Even that wasn't malicious, though it was incredibly ignorant.</comment>

<comment>As long as they labeled it as "beef" so it was easily avoidable, then it's a non-issue - basically, somebody who likes Tandori spices applied them to beef.   Nobody is being forced to eat it or asked to go out and kill a cow against their religion.</comment>

<comment>They were serving it on a religious holiday for Hindus.  It's like sponsoring a pig roast for Passover.</comment>

<comment>Not everyone is going to be Hindu or Jewish. I'm not gonna force vegetarians to eat turkey on Thanksgiving nor will they force me to eat their tofu crap. It's called freedom of choice. You can do what you want, but *I don't have to play along*, now do I?</comment>

<comment>I think you just scored an own goal there.  You won't force a vegetarian to eat meat, but Hindus will eat beef on their holy day and like it?</comment>

<comment>Nobody forced them to eat it, did they? Were Hindus the only ones eating on that given day? Might some non-Hindus possibly enjoy tandoori beef even though there are people in the room who have differing dietary laws?Everyone- yes EVERYONE- has the freedom to choose. You brainwashed neo-marxists just can't comprehend this for some reason!!!!</comment>

<comment>You're a mean one, Mr. Grinch.</comment>

<comment>Mmmm... Passover bacon...</comment>

<comment>Sacred cows make the best hamburgers</comment>

<comment>I think it was just labeled as Tandoori. But I don't see this as any different to when during Lent, my college served fish sandwiches on Friday that had bacon in the tartar sauce.</comment>

<comment>Did you have the option of getting the sandwich without the sauce?  If not, that's not defensible either.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't intimated that the sauce had bacon. It would've been easy to ask for a packet of tartar sauce instead of the fresh made, and that's what happened in subsequent weeks. But I wasn't the only person who needed to do an act of penance that day.Whether it's defensible or not, IMO, is not the point. A tolerant person takes acts of good faith in stride. The school was attempting to cater to the needs of others in both cases. If they did it on purpose that's one thing. But accidents happen.The other point is the hypocrisy of the out cry.</comment>

<comment>Agreed on the good faith point.  The tone of the protest is the most objectionable part.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, I know you're trying to be nice to these kids, but even this is not OK, and just makes me frightened of how insanely spoiled these kids are.Cafeteria food is not prepared by experts in Hinduism. The menu isn't created by people with lots of experience in cultural sensitivity studies. These are working class jobs for working class Ohioans who never had time to look into this stuff, who may never have gone beyond high school. Expertise in every culture on earth is not a moral requirement for all Americans, and demanding that everyone else understand your dietary restrictions is not reasonable. Laugh it off and move on.</comment>

<comment>"Cafeteria food is not prepared by experts in Hinduism."So don't make a dish expressly for the holiday.  And, if you do, do a little more research into dietary restrictions.  Not defending all the complaints, and the tenor in which all of them have been made.  But this one is legit.  If the school is making a special meal for a (Hindu, Jewish, Catholic, Muslim, etc.), try not to make it offensive to the religion.</comment>

<comment>I am sure that they tried to make the dishes correctly, they just got it wrong. As for what's "offensive" to the religion, that's up to the individual practitioner, not an absolute, and (in my opinion) you'd have to be extraordinarily sensitive to get offended in this case.Laying into minimum wage cafeteria workers and their bosses - also not much more than minimum wage - for incorrectly researching your traditional dishes when attempting to cater to you is really your problem, not theirs. Imagine an American ex-pat at an Indian college flipping out when the Indian cafeteria workers, in an attempt to be welcoming, offer vegi-dogs on the 4th of July.</comment>

<comment>That wouldn't be as bad a serving a religiously prohibited item to celebrate a religious holiday.  You have to give the kids that one.  The other stuff is whining and complaining.  </comment>

<comment>Just ask yourself if you think they would have have served pork Kofta or Kebabs for an Islamic holiday, or Matzo ball soup with pork for a Jewish holiday. Of course not. Everyone knows that Muslims and Jews don't eat pork. Along the same lines, everyone knows Hindus don't eat beef. If you don't know that Hindus don't eat beef, I don't know what world you are living in. I've been hearing "Indians worship cows" jokes for decades.Of course cafeteria food workers are not experts in Hinduism. The line workers and cooks don't set the menu. The menus are set by people above their pay grade who SHOULD know better.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes I wonder if Trump is trolling Republicans. Sometimes when I read stuff like this I wonder if such protesters are trolling the PC crowd.</comment>

<comment>Absent some specific indicator by the actors parody of extremism is indistinguishable from sincere expressions of it.</comment>

<comment>The fact that they served beef for a Hindu celebration proves that they are going about this thoughtlessly.  They can do better and try harder.  The rhetoric is out of proportion in general--I mean, good luck with the sushi thing--but Tandoori beef in honor of a Hindu holiday is indefensible.</comment>

<comment>Serving it during a Hindu holiday to Hindu students is idiotic, but if you ain't Hindu or vegetarian...do try the Tandoori beef.  I've had Tandoori beef and it's delicious.  The al pastor is pork shawarma.  Rubens aren't kosher. Chow down.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, it's the context.  Not the dish, which is fine on a neutral menu.</comment>

<comment>I think that's actually the primary issue with their activism.Serving Tandoori beef on Diwali was stupid and thoughtless; that's a legitimate gripe.Expecting ultra-fresh fish and a chef with 20+ years of experience preparing sushi at a cafeteria in Ohio is ridiculous. The closest place she could go to get that kind of sushi is probably Chicago, and one meal would easily run her $50+.Most of their "audience" is likely to miss the legitimate gripe, because it's buried under clueless self-indulgence like the sushi bit. They need to learn how to cut wheat from chaff, but maybe this is part of that process and the mass audience the internet provides it is just kind of unfortunate.</comment>

<comment>There is precious little difference.  Both are rooted in a poisonous entitlement belief that society somehow owes you anything other than the right to be left alone, free to pursue your own happiness.</comment>

<comment>I think the issue is that using the same theory, narrative, and rhetoric that has launched mass actions against violent oppression to protest sub-par dining hall food is not a promising point of entry into "critical thinking and collective action". The objective is great; the quality of the dining hall food is a material public issue, and it makes perfect sense for students to organize to improve it. It's when you say that the reason you need better food is the same as the reason we need amendments 13-15 and the Civil Rights Act that the rest of the country takes note, because those matter to all of us.It's a framing issue. Let that be the lesson.</comment>

<comment>It's called grandiosity. And grandiosity is the enemy of prudence.For an object lesson, viz. The Donald.We live in a popular culture where grandiosity, egoism, and melodrama are given a great deal of power. If you want to know what the world looks like when that is encouraged, read a novel by Ayn Rand and have The Donald as an image of a likely result.</comment>

<comment>Well, the erstwhile activists can learn an important lesson: your mistakes will not go unnoticed. It's an opportunity to learn the vital virtue of prudence. If you learn prudence, you can also learn how not to let your mistakes define you.In the scheme of things, progressive activists in training calling for Segregation By Another Name definitely need some experiential training in prudence.</comment>

<comment>Says the person with the Latin American Studies degree. </comment>

<comment>What is it with you righties and Latin American Studies?  The culture and history of a region of the world are completely legitimate topics for academic inquiry.</comment>

<comment>Studying stuff a person finds interesting is great.  Its the comparison to "predatory for-profit colleges peddling junk degrees" that grates.If a college collects more than $150,000 in student loans for a degree in Latin American Studies, its a good deal more predatory than any of the "for-profits" that the author is criticizing.</comment>

<comment>They are collecting tuition, not loans.  The student may be taking out loans, but that's regardless of whether the school of their choice is public, private or for-profit.  With a degree in Latin American Studies from an elite college like Oberlin, the graduate is positioned for international business or research opportunities that might be quite lucrative.  Where for-profits have earned their reputation for predatory behavior has been from marketing to and accepting students into programs in which they are not academically qualified and have a poor chance of obtaining a good outcome.  Not all the players are disreputable, of course, but enough in the industry have been guilty of this to give them a bad name.</comment>

<comment>". . . accepting students into programs in which they are not academically qualified and have a poor chance of obtaining a good outcome."Are we talking about for-profits, or about law schools?</comment>

<comment>Rimshot</comment>

<comment>Exactly. It's a nice field. An important field. But it has little economic value. Indeed the few Latin American Studies grads who use their degree are employed in Latin American Studies departments turning out more Latin American majors.The jobs that involve trading with Latin America or interacting with it rarely require or even use a Latin American Studies degrees. The companies would rather hire someone with a business or engineering degree.</comment>

<comment>Businesses are one type of employer.  Governments, NGOs, academic institutions are others.</comment>

<comment>Those are largely hypothetical. Oh sure, they'll hire someone occasionally, but this is a general problem with the liberal arts. The course work is so focused on history and "cultural studies" (ie oppression studies) that it has little practical value right now.To check myself, I typed in Latin American Studies into Monster.com and found that 9 of the 13 jobs were at universities turning out more Latin American Studies majors.http://jobs.monster.com/search...BTW, 13 is not a great big number. If you type in "mechanical engineering", they don't even get an accurate count. It just says 1000++.</comment>

<comment>How could anyone argue with such thorough research methodology and such an apples to apples comparison?</comment>

<comment>"So I go, 'What do I do now?''You can teach political science.'I go, 'To who?''To some other people.''Well what will they do?''Well they'll teach it to some other people.'This isn't college; this is Amway with a track team! I spent $40,000 on a pyramid scheme!" - Richard Jeni, who was saying this back in the mid-90s.</comment>

<comment>On the other hand, someone with Latin American Studies undergrad and an MBA would probably be very marketable to those companies. Many "soft" undergrad programs are great if you intend to get more technical training afterwards.</comment>

<comment>I think area studies used to be interesting, but have been spun off course by the same trends that have made other areas of the humanities look absurd to those who went to school before the 1990s.</comment>

<comment>The same way that parents and clergy hated Elvis.</comment>

<comment>Not really. Elvis was entertainment, and we are talking about education.  I have to say that it was usually pretty easy to tell who the ethnic studies majors were in my history or PoliSci seminars 25 years ago. They tended to be more strident but less well-informed, and generally less capable as well.</comment>

<comment>A stanford latin american studies dept outed the whole bay of pigs fiasco before it happened.  http://articles.latimes.com/20...According to my great uncle, who knew the guy (I think he was his student?), the FBI got Stanford to shut down that program as a result.The right wing hates Latin American Studies departments because they at best disrupt the right wing narrative and at worst disrupt the US's militarized and its client oligarchies' political agenda, along with their overall air of competence.On top of that you can't make money directly off of those degrees. The right wing values education mostly as a form of self advancement and the advancement of the US's competitiveness.  Broadening the social-intellectual consciousness of potential employees does not fall in the latter category, and where it falls into the previous it often disrupts the latter.</comment>

<comment>Another fool that can't seem to get the concept that the US actually has economic and political interests in Latin America, and that it is actually valuable to have people in our country who know something about it.</comment>

<comment>Now that you mention it, I tend to have more interesting conversations with baristas who are well-educated.</comment>

<comment>Right.  No one actually works in business or government that has expert knowledge of international regions.  Guess you wouldn't know if you're spending your time hanging out in coffee shops.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the US has important interests and trade is great, but no one really needs a degree in Latin American Studies to work in this area. It's better to study business itself -- and Spanish or Portuguese. Knowing something about the history of oppression isn't that useful.</comment>

<comment>Studying business itself is a questionable tactic for getting ahead.  People working in business are as likely to have liberal arts degrees, be lawyers or studied engineering as to have studied business.</comment>

<comment>When I was getting a somewhat useful MBA, us technical folks were much better at the business courses we supposedly had no undergraduate background in than those with business undergrad degrees.  A finance teacher did a little math once that I'd learned as a college freshman and the business folks in the class acted like he'd done a magic trick.</comment>

<comment>I'm more likely to hire a latin american studies major than a biz major. The latter is generally a drone, the former more likely to have at least some basic analytical skills.</comment>

<comment>And where do you work? Do you actually hire anyone? If look at one of my other comments, you'll see that I went to Monster and found exactly 13 jobs for Latin American Studies majors. 9 of them were in universities turning out more Latin American Studies majors.At least there's not much competition for you and you can hire plenty of your folks with basic analytical skills.</comment>

<comment>You found 13 jobs that specifically REQUIRE a Latin-American Studies degree. Search for jobs that require a non-specific liberal arts degree and you'll realize your argument holds much less weight than you assumed.</comment>

<comment>Uh no. These are just jobs that ask for one. They don't even require one. But they probably prefer them.And I never made the argument that you couldn't get a job elsewhere with the degree-- only that there's not much demand for it. So sure, you might get your local Starbucks to hire you with the other liberal arts degrees.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I hire 1-2 people a year, generally recent grads. I'm in budget/finance.I haven't in fact hired any Latin American studies majors (at least that I'm aware of), just saying I'm more likely to hire one than a generic business major. My last hire recently graduated with two majors: accounting and political economy.</comment>

<comment>I'm with Terri.  I'd like my Latin American experts to know the area and language.  I can teach them what "return on equity" means in a few minutes.  Takes a long time to understand the region.  My guess is that a third of the newly minted MBAs would have no idea that they speak Portuguese in Brazil.  I'm sure many of them assume they speak Spanish or "Brazilian" or "who cares man".</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but I've had the opposite experience. The Latin American Studies folks just want to talk about oppression in an academic environment. They want to pursue hair-splitting, theoretical arguments and spend the week arguing about social justice. The business majors are practical and they see the advantage of learning the local language immediately.</comment>

<comment>What does the "culturally appropriated cafeteria food" activism show, if not an utter *lack* of "critical thinking"?</comment>

<comment>Uh... no!  Obviously Oberlin did it intentionally to oppress minority students!  Protest!  Picket!  Demand resignations!  Where's my white privilege scourge?  I'm late on my hourly self-flagellation.Ah, found it.  Right next to my male privilege testicle vice and my cis-privilige fingernail needles.</comment>

<comment>"A key part of such an environment is the ability for students to experiment, make mistakes, and pick trivial targets to practice on without the fear of national reprobation."I see a few flaws here. This is an "aww, aren't they cute?" approach to student activism. I don't think looking down on students and treating them as not serious just because they are students is a good approach. The Halloween costume controversy at Yale actually came from trying to treat the students like adults who can regulate their own behavior through social norms. These are adults. Their protests are real (even though they may sometimes be nonsensical). To trivialize them is to ignore that some students have gotten faculty fired through their protests. That's serious business, and is beyond something we should just look at as cute, or "practice". You don't use training wheels on a motorcycle. These protests have real consequences.</comment>

<comment>Man, all you writers here are young. Doesn't journalism require dropped testicles (or whatever the ovarian equivalent is) and a few scars? This is just depressing.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, the money in journalism has dwindled to such an extent due to competition with free conent that skilled seasoned writers often are forced into other professions to make ends meet. Generally, the only way to make it today in journalism is to: (1) Become one of the few well-paid celebrity journalists; (2) Be independently wealthy and do the job for the prestige (or perceived prestige); or (3) Be young with few financial obligations.</comment>

<comment>Menses?  You asked.</comment>

<comment>Thank you</comment>

<comment>Thank you, Alice! My thoughts exactly.</comment>

<comment>What a ridiculous article, lol.  Americans have been protesting one thing or another since well before our birth as a nation and we certainly dont need anyone or anything from the entitled children at Oberlin to teach us anything in that regard.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Oy. It's OK.  They are just kids.  What do they know?</comment>

<comment>Hindu cuisine apparently.</comment>

<comment>Reminds me of the student activism at what used to Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. In that case it was militant feminist. Sadly the school had to close as they lost Alumni funding and a genera sense they went off the deep end. Will history repeat itself. Tomatoes, Red Peppers, Potatoes, and more were appropriated from the Americans by the rest of the world. What next in the students mind: pizza!</comment>

<comment>So this goofball protest is just for practice?  Sorry - There are real consequences to this sort of nonsense and real people get hurt.  Oberlin students are adults - and very privileged ones at that.  If they want to do some good, they can pick better targets and tactics for their protest.</comment>

<comment>Student protesting is fine, but that does not mean we must respect each and every movement and cause as equally valid - and students certainly don't "need" a space to "experiment" with activism.Leave it to the Atlantic to consistently provide knee-jerk support to every ridiculous campus tantrum. It is as if they are trying to safeguard the budding leftists until they figure out how to advance an agenda without revealing themselves as total nimrods.</comment>

<comment>calling it a tantrum would be a compliment</comment>

<comment>The students are free to protest. The rest of the world is free to call their protest stupid. One of the more important lessons would-be activists (that is cute little title you gave them, right?) can learn is that not everything is worth getting worked up about. One thing about speaking up: you invite scrutiny. If they are not prepared to be laughed at, they need to find a new hobby</comment>

<comment>as a registered anti-activist activist  I PROTEST their stupid pseudo-activism</comment>

<comment>As an Irish Catholic, should I regard any potato not properly boiled as a micro-aggression?</comment>

<comment>The potato originated in South America and only reached Europe because of European colonialism.Every potato eaten by whitey is cultural appropriation. Check yo'self!</comment>

<comment>Well can we at least claim weeping sentimentally ?  How about being half in the bag at midnight mass?  Getting arrested for drunken brawls?  Impossible to understand political divides?</comment>

<comment>"Impossible to understand political divides?"The ME stole this one from you.</comment>

<comment>good - that is what we do.you can always move to Mars</comment>

<comment>Then I'd be culturally appropriating Martians.(My post was sarcastic btw)</comment>

<comment>Everything about The Martian was imperialist / colonialist white privilege!!!</comment>

<comment>experiment with activism by helping the poor instead of complaining about the quality of your sushi</comment>

<comment>The value?  Entertainment.</comment>

<comment>They ought to OCCUPY A DESKand do their freakin HOMEWORKand stuff the activism tired of hearing it.   And don't try to tell me that the Socialist Workers Party does "activism"what a bunch of amateur idiots.To be a valid activist you need a legitimate complaint. You have NONE</comment>

<comment>As soon as the author says, "When I was a Latin American Studies major..." readers know we all we need to know about this piece. A former Latin American Studies major at Oberlin writing about student protests in 2015 is like a Bolshevik writing about contemporary Russian politics in 1917.</comment>

<comment>yeah, who would study Latin America!  Only crazy leftists! It's not like the US has any interests there.</comment>

<comment>At Oberlin?You have no clue what's happening in Latin American Studies departments.</comment>

<comment>It's all Marxist indoctrination!</comment>

<comment>You still managed to miss the point.  Oberlin LA Studies majors are as in touch with modern Latin America as Lena Dunham is with the working class of New York State.</comment>

<comment>How do you know?</comment>

<comment>And you know this how?</comment>

<comment>that is funny.</comment>

<comment>don't think so. i read a good portion of this article and did not have that reaction to that sentence</comment>

<comment>The Oberlin Food Protests are a bunch of ultra-rich kids trying to guilt-shame cafeteria workers who make $10 / hour, and yes, they're being serious, because they are that clueless.</comment>

<comment>The thing is protesting against Chiquita well within the norms of a leftist college, and generally reasonable.Protesting against cultural appropriation of food in a cafeteria, is on the other hand, stupid.Students would actually be better off binging net-flix, or smoking weed.Activism, in itself, is not a positive good. It is only good when its for things that are itself good.</comment>

<comment>Protesting events that happened 60 years ago may be reasonable to leftist college students but it's not productive.</comment>

<comment>Possibly. My point is more that their is a substansive criticism of chiquita. That people may or may not agree with. And may or may not be past its sell by date. But at least its something.Protesting about cultural appropriation of food though? There is no there there.</comment>

<comment>Smoking weed, binge watching Netflix and making naked snow angels are all way better pastimes than protesting the 'cultural appropriation', whatever that is, of cafeteria food.</comment>

<comment>I agree that there is nothing wrong with activism if it is a worthy cause.But cafeteria food? What do these coddled children think? Their parents are paying for a five star restaurant?Cafeteria food is supposed to be bland bad imitations of high quality restaurant fare. That's the American way.More indication that we are allowing a generation of wimps and whiners.</comment>

<comment>Nice try:You have got to be kidding me. The very nature of these demands expose these students as very, very, very privileged indeed. The rest of the country isn't blind, Alice. We can see very well the intensely spoiled nature of the majority of these protests you're attempting to cheer. You don't get to borrow the legacy of Oberlin students' participation in the Underground Railroad to justify a protest against the cafeteria for not serving food just like mom used to make.A lot of us actual liberals are getting very angry. Your demands for forbearance and leniency towards movements that extend neither to anyone at all, who actively attempt to stifle free speech and who demand harsh punishments for behavior that no sane person would ever object to are falling on deaf ears. Enough. This is going to change.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>I suggest that the Italian American kids complain about cultural obliteration  when their traditional semolina lasagna with a Bolognese sauce ( picking up on your nom de guerre) is served up as some gluten/ free vegetable/ hindered/ non dairy cheese failed experiment.</comment>

<comment>Don't be silly.  White people don't have culture.  Lasagna is... like... a universal... like streusel, brie, and shepherd's pie.  You can't appropriate those!</comment>

<comment>whew. Thanks for the clarification. One man's lasagna is another man's pad thai, chicken biryani, shanghai noodles, and falafel on pita....... it;s a small world after all.......</comment>

<comment>Just such a failed experiment crossed my plate last Friday.I ignored the trigger warning, and went in. Where I couldn't find anyone to pin with the micro-aggression, I still felt that my rights had been violated.I was angry./s</comment>

<comment>I think the point is that kids are idiots.  They do stuff that rational adults don't.  They try on social identities like outfits, a new one every day.  They make mistakes.  It used to be, the kids got pushback from the administrators, and were mostly ignored.  They graduated, got over their issue of the day, moved on with their lives, got jobs, families, and the cycle started anew.Now, the kids know how to get attention.  Twitter, facebook, etc, and *BOOM,* ABC has a camera on campus.  The adults can't ignore the issue without getting called racist and insensitive.Everybody loses, including the kids who do eventually grow out of it, and the administrators who let their hand be forced.</comment>

<comment>Well, yeah. The undeserved attention is what the internet pushback is based on, and why it's called for. How are these kids ever going to learn what a legitimate grievance looks like if the administration always caves immediately and the rest of the world says "kids will be kids!"?I'm glad they're being embarassed. If this is their cynical attempt to hijack social justice verbiage to get their way, they deserve to be called out. If they actually believe bad cafeteria food is a social justice issue, they're desperately in need of a reality check. And what better for that than a heeping spoonful of internet shame?</comment>

<comment>The kids are likely acting in good faith.  They do believe what they're saying.  As far as I'm concerned, the shame should be minor, time-limited, and come from the administrators, not the internet.The onus is on us to support the administration, not to judge the kids.</comment>

<comment>Normally I'd agree 100%, but for two issues:1. The administration is not doing what you suggest, and2. This is just the latest example of a disturbing trend on university campuses that (to my mind) needs addressing by the wider culture, particularly because the administrations never seem to push back.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  We need to support the administrators and ignore the kids.  The problem is, the kids get a lot of airtime, and the administrators are (justifiably) afraid of coming down on the wrong side of the issue.  So they cave.Remember that residence hall administrator at Yale who wrote the note saying that maybe the University shouldn't weigh in on student Halloween costumes?  She resigned.  To me, that's symptomatic of problems in the broader culture, not just at Yale.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>It's possible, but I have a hard time believing anyone sincerely thinks sub-par sushi qualifies as ethnic oppression. Maybe because that level of privilege is beyond my personal experience. I did attend a state school (gasp) after all. Starting to think I'm better off for it, too.And, as Mr. Lasgna pointed out, the administration is scrambling to meet their demands, not providing any minor, time-limited pushback.When it comes to pushback, I know the internet is harsh. I know dissent hurts. But that's just life. Just like shitty cafeteria food is life. No more protecting "kids" (they're at least 18...) from life.</comment>

<comment>It's hard to say what the kids think.  I believe they are probably mostly sincere.  Either way, I would prefer if the media stayed out of it, and the administrators acted like adults.  Neither of those things is happening here, unfortunately.</comment>

<comment>Freddie DeBoer's tweet ended the conversation for me. Here are students at a $45k a year private elite college berating cafeteria workers for not serving authentic world cuisine in their dining hall. I mean, does it get any more privilege abusing than that?</comment>

<comment>I wonder where they stand on Foie Gras?</comment>

<comment>they would love it; after all, those geese never complain about being underfed</comment>

<comment>It's the framing. Of course students can and should complain about and maybe even protest bad dining hall food. But it says a lot about the campus intellectual culture that people feel the need to gain leverage on this through privileging immigrants, when boring white people have an investment in decent sushi and the like too.</comment>

<comment>protest cafeteria food? don't think so</comment>

<comment>Maybe we can get them to start a permanent hunger strike  and we can watch then whither away. Or maybe set themselves on fire..</comment>

<comment>They should be able to do both. I have faith in them.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't trust them to know how to operate matches.</comment>

<comment>There is some value in practicing advocacy for a good cause, and there are lots of good causes out there.  This one amuses us because the cause itself is especially annoying.  Nobody likes it when people who have way more advantages than they do take on the mantle of the oppressed in order to win an argument.Also, I was with this "cultural appropriation" thing when it was about Native American ceremonial objects, but it has gone too far if it's all about critiquing sandwiches.</comment>

<comment>There's some fancy fashion designer that copied prints exactly (exactly - not inspired) from S American natives who make fabrics and then attempted to copyright them when she used them in her designs.  She tried to sue another designer that did much the same thing.  That's BS exploitation.  Kind of sort of trying to make an internationally known sandwich and failing.  Not so much.</comment>

<comment>If you're actually trying to drive someone else out of business by stealing their invention, that's a problem.  Everyone involved could be middle class white people, and it would still be thoroughly obnoxious.  But no producer of good sandwiches is harmed if someone else in a different location makes bad sandwiches.</comment>

<comment>Not to contradict you, but that calls into question the European laws protecting certain kinds of foods from particular regions... things like champagne and certain cheeses.  The laws were created specifically because those who make those famous foods didn't want others using their region's term for a lesser quality product.I guess they were thinking that you COULD drive someone out of business by making "bad sandwiches", so to speak...</comment>

<comment>Last week my wife and I went to the store and bought a 20-kilo bag of white rice (this is in Quito, where we live). Good thing we did: the house was full of folks all week. We fed them. We do this, primarily because they have less than we do--far less.One day we fed, in addition to our family of five, breakfast and lunch to four of my wife's sewing-school classmates and dinner to six members of our extended family. We served them all rice. White rice. Cheap rice. Cooked simply, with absolutely no thought to where the rice came from, or the extent to which its preparation matched cultural norms or expectations. With the rice we served vegetables, some chicken, fried bananas, some of my wife's excellent papaya juice (among other things). It's not difficult. People are hungry, so you feed them. Then they thank you. As they should; as they are happy to do. It is not "organizing." It is not "protest." It is not, in short, child's play, swaddled in the luxury of abstraction and distance. It is work. It is important, it addresses an immediate need (hunger), it costs money and sweat.I suggest the Oberlin students start feeding people poorer than they are, every single day, seven days a week for six months or so, paying for the food out of their own pockets, their own labor, as my wife and I do. Cooking the food, serving their guests, cleaning up afterwards. At least one and usually two and often three meals a day. Then we'll talk. Until then they have no standing in the forum that is my kitchen.</comment>

<comment>Yup! Donate some of Daddy's money to a food pantry!</comment>

<comment>I still think food in school cafeterias should be about nutrition, not delicacies.But what do I know? Those silver spoon-fed kids must have different priorities than us mere mortals!</comment>

<comment>Oberlin.   Isn't that where Leah Dunham went and later made false allegations about some dude?  Basically ruined the guys life.   I think that was at Oberlin.  Pretty sure. On a lighter note.  I think the the item about the fried chicken is a set-up.  Imagine if the school served that every Sunday.  The claim would be, "whoa, what up with that, MoFos?"</comment>

<comment>Yep, same  school, same glowingly amazing type of 'socially aware' people. It's ok though- white men are all pigs that deserve to die. No harm done, right? We got an oppression olympics to win!</comment>

<comment>If students are unsatisfied with the dining hall food, that's a perfectly legitimate issue for them to petition the administration about.What is noteworthy about the Oberlin protest is that the students have decided to frame their dissatisfaction with the dining-hall food as an identity-based grievance.They have learned that this is the way to win an argument, and they have learned that white progressives feel they cannot credibly disagree with the "experience" of a minority who perceives a "microaggression."The value of this is that this is the point where a claimed identity-based grievance is so farfetched that white people finally feel comfortable publicly dismissing it as invalid.</comment>

<comment>That's the real issue here.  They are in for quite a shock when they discover how counterproductive identity politics are in the real world.</comment>

<comment>I hate to admit I agree with this.  I wouldn't call myself a "progressive," but I am generally sympathetic and/or in favor of some of the larger goals of the campus movement.  I also do think there's some leeway for subjective, identity-based grievances. But, I totally agree with your point that the unwillingness to point out some of the limitations of the framework is allowing things to get ridiculous, and that it's these more obviously absurd examples that make it easier to point out the issues with the general framework.</comment>

<comment>To further your point, I'd also point out that there's evidence this issue has something to do with far-left ideology, or indulgence of it, primarily because issues of student excess have come almost uniformly from extremely liberal colleges (Oberlin, Wesleyan, Clairmont-McKenna, Brown). Other schools have focused far more on meaningful issues, and/or simply said "no" to some of the more excessive "demands."</comment>

<comment>Oberlin students are on the cutting edge of student activism.</comment>

<comment>Never forget that McCain backstabbed a conservative radio talk show host, Bill Cunningham, in 2008 who introduced him with praise before a speech.Cunningham's crime? Using Obama's sacred and holy middle name.</comment>

<comment>Well, that was random.</comment>

<comment>Nuke Oberlin from orbit.</comment>

<comment>Personally, I could care less that they're protesting. There was a Global Justice group when I was in college and they did this sort of thing with fair trade coffee.  I attended one of their meetings and didn't agree with their approach or world view and that was it.  The main concern, and this is what Conor was concerned about in his article on the subject, is that, instead of being rebutted and forced to get more facts (or, in my opinion, to think about the practical limitations of a concept like "Cultural appropriation") which, would provide a genuine learning experience, they're essentially getting their way with very little pushback.This story bothers me far less than the incident regarding a yoga class, where a free yoga class, aimed at students with disabilities, was suspended due to similarly silliness.  In this case, kids are still going to eat, but real harm was done, in my opinion, with the yoga situation.</comment>

<comment>Buying fair trade coffee has economic benefits, presumably, to the growers and producers, who stand a better chance of being fairly compensated when people buy that product. That's not the same "sort of thing" at all. Feeling deeply, personally aggrieved by cafeteria food and staging a protest over it strips activism of any potential positive outcomes that would make a difference in anyone's material life. If these precious Obies were advocating for cafeteria workers to get additional training at the school's expense, followed by a wage gain, THAT would be more similar to your fair trade situation.</comment>

<comment>I actually agree with you and didn't mean to necessarily equate fair trade coffee with this example.  My point was that Global Justice people probably had some similarly far-fetched (in this case, anti-corporate) ideas that were far from reasonable, but that weren't taken seriously by administrators and certainly didn't get the media attention of this piece, which is being pretty universally mocked (even this article defending it is calling it ridiculous).</comment>

<comment>"I could care less that they're protesting."You could?  Then why don't you?</comment>

<comment>They need lots of activism practice, true.  But making utter asses of themselves, they have that down.</comment>

<comment>Dear Oberlin Students protesting cafeteria food: get off your a-- and apply for a job in the cafeteria where you can educate the hourly employees who most likely were not gifted your educational opportunities about the nuances of the foods that your mother cooked for you, because god knows you did not cook it for yourselves; then tell us all about the wonderful successes you experience from the inside of the stock pot while cleaning it. Until then, keep your yap shut.the author should have learned about Chiquita banana in high school. It has been common knowledge since like, 60 years??? Note to died in the wool liberals. Stop enabling idiots. Note to Atlantic. Stop advertising for click bait college students with silly articles that attempt to defend, , on even the slightest terms, stupid actions by privileged college students.  A true intellectual knows when the debate has been overtaken by the crybabies. At that point there is no debate. ignore the crybabies.note: Proud parent of hard working college students who are paying 50% of their education through jobs and scholarships at state universities.. they are way to busy for this crap.</comment>

<comment>Idiocy doesn't equal "practice."They should learn discernment.</comment>

<comment>The problem here isn't that people shouldn't "experiment" with social justice activism (debatable) -- it's that they are assigning the label of "cultural appropriation" to an undeserved subject.  Racism, discrimination, colonialism -- these are real evils with real power and significance behind them.  Conflating a misguided cause to fight inauthentic food at a college cafeteria with the courageous stands taken by real-world people* to fight these evils does a disservice to those who have championed legitimate causes.  It would be like me writing up a petition to fight racism on college campuses based on the overabundance of white rice in cuisine, and then hopping on to twitter and quoting MLK or Malcolm X.*It has been made abundantly clear to me in and out of person that anyone who has attended Oberlin in the past two decades does not inhabit the same world as the rest of us.</comment>

<comment>'Offer more scholarships to undocumented students'? Are you ****ing serious?I work my tail off, 80 hour weeks, and pay heaps of my life away in taxes. Yes, my life; you don't get back the hours you work. They're gone forever. But can I get one red cent in financial aid aside from a student loan at ridiculous interest? Hah, no. No scholarship qualifications either, although I do get a good laugh when someone can get a full ride for throwing a ball around (a basically useless activity). I pay every dollar of my tuition out of pocket.So I hope people understand when I'm a bit offended at the notion of someone coming here illegally (yes, it's against the law, that makes it illegal, deal with it) and people want to give them scholarships or student aid, when they have contributed nothing.I should probably quit college anyways. Frankly it's the worst investment I have made in my life. I did the math a few weeks ago, very thoroughly. If I had invested the money I've paid to these useless, bloated, outmoded institutions, in the same way I've invested my so-far-measly retirement nest egg, and just kept working my ambulance job, even with conservative returns I would be a millionaire by 50 with $30,000 a year in dividend income.Of course by then investing will be so thoroughly punished that it will all be useless anyways, but it's nice to dream. This feels like the erosion generation. The more I try to work, build, invest, save, the more I get eaten away. I'm told I should find work 'fulfilling', but I see that as an illusion. How is working to achieve someone else's goals fulfilling? I'm in public service, but the point still stands. In fact I'd say it's almost worse here, especially since I get to see first-hand the outright WASTE committed by government services which my generation is clamoring for. They have no idea what they're wanting, and in my area it's considered 'modest'.I can't wait to get out of here. I feel like Han Solo being carted off to the carbonite chamber.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if they will still be concerned with the food when they get their first student loan payment invoice and don't have a job. They can expect that payment to be larger now to, due to the thousands (millions?) of dollars that will be spent ensuring "culturally sensitive food" in the dining hall.People are the worst...</comment>

<comment>Picky about food, then picky about a job, then picky about lifestyle..... No grit.</comment>

<comment>It's interesting that if you're not hearing a refrain of mockery toward young people's activism, then you're hearing complaints about how young people are apathetic and don't care about anything other than themselves.</comment>

<comment>Well, in this case, we have both. Activist students that are too apathetic and self centered to civilly and maturely discuss potential ways to improve the cafeteria with the management and the university administration. </comment>

<comment>But didn't they in fact  "discuss potential ways to improve the cafeteria," as you say? I've read elsewhere that they met with people at the school who are in charge of the food selection and had a productive conversation. And in what way were their demands not civil?There's nothing new about trying to police activism. This is just a case where a larger than usual number of people take glee from sitting at their computers and telling others how silly and childish their activism is. The point of activism really isn't always to be reasonable. It is to bring attention to an issue.</comment>

<comment>If the only thing you care about is calling people racist for undercooking sushi, then yes, you are apathetic, petulant and small minded.</comment>

<comment>It's quite possible that I missed it, but did they use the word "racist"? You can accuse someone of cultural appropriation without calling them racist. And for the scenario you presented (whether or not it is the case here), I would say such a person could arguably be called petulant or small minded, but I still don't think you could say they are apathetic. Perhaps lazy in their use of words, but not specifically apathetic.</comment>

<comment>It's the same thing- name calling to make a point without a point for the sake of being petty. There's no such thing as cultural appropriation anyway- just like the rest of these oppression olympics nonsense these kids keep droning on about.</comment>

<comment>Well, it seems we disagree on what constitutes reality (I very much believe cultural appropriation is a real thing, whether or not this accusation at cafeteria food is a valid one), so I guess there's no reason to continue this debate.</comment>

<comment>"...but students need space to experiment with activism."  This is pissant activism, solipsistic outrage about a plate of food. Meanwhile, the issues deserving of the kind of student activism that makes a difference...nah. Too complicated.</comment>

<comment>Need room to experiment with activism? Why is that?</comment>

<comment>Experimenting with activism and government is one thing. Practicing Soviet-style insanity is another thing. I'm glad I'm a few years older and avoided this bull.</comment>

<comment>Ms. Ollstein, fair point about the need for students to "experiment with activism", both as a learning "how to" experience as well as from a "how people will react" perspective. I'm not sure that most of the critics are saying "...there are more important battles current students could be fighting." I think it's more a response to what's perceived as rage-based activism, which seems even less credible when it's based on cultural appropriation. An approach that said, "Hey, our cafeteria tries to have cultural dishes... we have people from those cultures...maybe we could put those two together to make a better experience for everyone", might work better than, "Help, help, I'm being oppressed ..."</comment>

<comment>What you talk about is maturity and leadership. Those have no place in modern America according to many. </comment>

<comment>We're not seeing much of it in a certain primary race, that's for sure.</comment>

<comment>And the White House and Capitol Hill</comment>

<comment>I'd definitely point to the Teabaggers.</comment>

<comment>Ah, my alma mater...  I haven't been back to campus in about twenty-five years but it was a great place to an education and, despite what some might conclude from the content of the article above, I believe it still is.</comment>

<comment>At one time - in many colleges and not too long ago - these issues would have largely been avoided as members of the student body would be working in the cafeteria. Now, the idea that these precious snowflakes would perform manual labor and work in a lowly cafeteria kitchen is too terrible to contemplate.Also, these students could have civilly talked to the management of the cafeteria and the university administration about how the cafeteria could be improved. Of course, that approach would go against the modern American ethos that places preening and activism over results and leadership.</comment>

<comment>I worked at a bar down the street from the dining hall. It paid better. Anyone with basic math ability knew Old Queens was better for the bottom line.</comment>

<comment>I was thinking about this too.This protest is not just yet another example of PC gone mad. It's yet another example of consumerism gone made, of elites having absolutely no clue about the rest of the country.This would not have happened in my college cafeteria because we were made of sterner stuff, sure. It also wouldn't have happened because it would never have occurred to us that we were entitled to cuisine prepared to our specifications. But leaving those aside: mostly it wouldn't have happened because we all either worked in the cafeteria (or somewhere similar) or knew someone who did and would potentially be injured by the protest. These students don't seem to have that range of acquaintances.</comment>

<comment>Oh my gosh, I had best stop using whipped cream during sex.  I am appropriating a food and using it for some purpose for which it is not sanctioned, it may even be offensive to some people!On the other hand maybe we should just take a ruler to the behinds of the entitled little shits that seem to make up our university classes these days.</comment>

<comment>A couple of thoughts should the author be reading them:"Neither charge proved true, but the critiques pushed us to do still more research and outreach to win hearts and minds. "Thank you. Too much "activism" we see nowadays is of the lazy variety, including all the way up to national politics. "Lazy" activism can be defined as, "instead of doing the hard work of research and outreach to win hearts and minds, we'll just demonize our opponents." Real activism with a real objective deserves to win; lazy activism deserves to lose, even if the cause they are fighting for is just. "I hope that embarrassment does not have a chilling effect on future student campaigns. "Oh, it's much worse than that. The dining hall matter is just silly. That's not activism, that's children whining about poor food quality. But henceforth, I can tell you that if I (and I;m sure many others) are presented with a job candidate from Oberlin during these years, they will be playfully quizzed to determine their views on the dining room dustup. Any answer other than "wasn't that all stupid and embarrassing" will get them shown the door.</comment>

<comment>During a recent trip I noticed a person of African descent improperly misappropriating western Culture by using 'rolling luggage' (I let him slide on the trousers and jacket). After a brief exchange he apologized for his insulting micro-aggression and then carefully balanced the luggage on his head and walked away. I stood there on the sky-walk and basked in the warm glow of a waning sun knowing that I'd just struck another blow for 'Social Justice'. I like to imagine that he's taken my advice to heart and is now comfortably outfitted in the hide of some animal and living in a Mud hut.Yeah Liberals, that's how stupid you sound.</comment>

<comment>This article has to be sarcastic.</comment>

<comment>No, I assure you there really are people in this world dumb enough to complain about food not being ethnic enough for them and people dumb enough to defend them.</comment>

<comment>Up to a point I agree with this author. I haven't commented much on the current college hoopla because I am not currently associated with a college, the people doing the demonstrating are (for the most part) still young, for the most part it hasn't been a real issue, and frankly I have better things to do.I even agree that there is value in students demonstrating. I tried it once in high school and will never do it again. I found out then that you can't control the message of the mob and that the mob quickly becomes stupid. You can however make it look like you agree with the basest stupidity by swelling the ranks of the mob.On the other hand, the recent demonstrations have at times moved into actually dangerous territory, calls for indoctrination and violations of the 1st amendment come to mind. And the danger that the author may not recognize is that aggressive demonstrators can chill the speech of their on-campus detractors. The internet might not always give the best that free speech has to offer but it is darn safe to comment on. And if that is the only place for the protesters to hear disagreement then it is performing a service.So maybe aspiring writers should hope that The Atlantic will understand that they were young when they were in college.</comment>

<comment>Experimenting with activism is great, and can teach a young person a lot. Throwing your weight around and accusing cafeteria workers of offending you racially because you don't like the food is laughable. And you will be laughed at. Which can also teach a young person a lot.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  The line between customer dissatisfaction and personal offense is pretty vast.  Too many that grew up avoiding direct conflict can't just "make change" by having a normal, rational conversation with people that can change a policy or a menu item.</comment>

<comment>Someone please notify CERN.  We have found an alternate universe. Nothing makes sense here.</comment>

<comment>From the better written NYT article on the subject: “These are demands and not suggestions,” the document read. “If these demands are not taken seriously, immediate action from the Africana community will follow.”I think there's a fine line between students experimenting with activism and issuing threats & making demands like it was a hostage negotiation.</comment>

<comment>A new generation of little Soviets are just taking over.</comment>

<comment>Instead of complaining or criticizing, why don’t thestudents put together workshops to educate the campus community about theirnative cuisine and demonstrate how to properly prepare some dishes?</comment>

<comment>Fair Trade products are worth seeking. The FT rules improve the lives of the people producing the products.  But ethnic food is not, in the real world, a matter of cultural appropriation, or anything much at all.  This SAT-type smart author doesn't get it at all.  More than anything else, this article is an ambitious writer's attempt (successful apparently) to bootstrap an Oberlin degree into a "think" piece in a "serious" publication.  Not a good reflection on the education received.</comment>

<comment>Experimenting with activism.For all the world's ills they're making poorly phrased racist demands about cafeteria food.These are young idiots. I can only hope their peers, who we're not reading about, are a little more sensible.After the millennials comes the snowflakes, the news would make it seem. </comment>

<comment>i'm glad at least someone at that school is embarrassed. If i saw oberlin on a resume, i'd think twice if i want such an "activist" on my team.</comment>

<comment>What the author is overlooking is that activism for its own sake isn't a good thing, any more so than starting fistfights with random strangers on the street. Activism is—by definition—combative and disruptive. There are situations where it's appropriate, just like there are situations where it's appropriate to hit somebody. But they're rare.Also, anyone upset that a bad version of General Tso's Chicken is culturally appropriative is an absolute moron. The dish originated in New York several decades ago, long after the death of General Tso, who had likely never heard of anything even resembling it. Also, it's usually made with ketchup.</comment>

<comment>I read about the use of beef in Indian food as a source of cultural whatever, since the entitled morons think Indians are yoga practicing, vegetarians who sing and dance to terrible Bollywood music.. The fact is beef is a political issue in India. The vast majority of Indians are not vegetarians, only the upper caste, and more specifically, the Brahmans are vegetarians. For vast majority of Indians, including the world's second largest Muslim population in the world, beef is a source of protein. There are people who are being killed by right wing Hindu fanatics over consumption of  beef and the little entitled pigs at Oberlin think adding beef to curry is cultural appropriation? Think again. The civil society of India is standing up against vegetarianism and the power structures that promote them. But then again one rotten child's cultural appropriation is another human beings survival tool.</comment>
