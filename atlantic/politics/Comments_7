<comment>Why have this bad theater in the lily white states of the U.S.Why not just vote all at once â€“ and screw the drama.</comment>

<comment>The fact Iowa and New Hampshire don't remotely reflect the demographics of the US but have disproportionate power over the election has been noted numerous times.</comment>

<comment>Yes and I am noting it again. It is ridiculous that these two backwaters of the U.S. have anything to do with selecting the next President.</comment>

<comment>We are all God's children, sweetie!</comment>

<comment>Here's a cookie reply.I take pity on you sad, homeless trolls.</comment>

<comment>I have no problem with you playing with your "God" dolls.Hopefully you have no problem with gay marriage, women in power, the end of racism.</comment>

<comment>bath salts</comment>

<comment>Actually, few do, which is why institutional racism has vanished, there are plently of women in power, and gay marriage is on its way to universal acceptance.There are, however, more than a few reactionaries who cling to those old tired, worn out cliches of victimization because they can't stand to lose their whomping sticks.Recognize yourself?</comment>

<comment>"Mean_Girl" is a racist and a troll.OTOH, every four years IA, NH, etc. let down the U.S. by failing to do the patriotic thing and ask the candidates real questions. To Iowans and NHians, it's all about them: "I'm going to talk to the candidate and choose the one I like best." The HuffPost has a post about an Iowan who's choosing Trump in part due to his hair.They don't have the patriotism to do their jobs as citizens and to realize that it isn't just about them.Want to solve things? Contact those in NH and demand they start asking the candidates *real* questions, not just the usual puffballs. See stumptrump.us and questionsforhillary.comShame those in NH into being citizens, not just spectators.</comment>

<comment>There is no god. God is dead.</comment>

<comment>Which one?</comment>

<comment>All of them. They're all just ethnic variations on the same faith-based malarkey. It tells you something sad about humanity.</comment>

<comment>How you are trashing New Hampshire.</comment>

<comment>New Hampshire has some of the highest college attainment and SAT scores in the country, tied with Massachusetts. And it has one of the lowest unemployment at 3.2%.If only your state and others can be New Hampshire, America would actually be a leading first world country.</comment>

<comment>Nominees Dole (winner in 1988), Huckabee (2008), and Santorum (2012)  would like to have some of that that disproportionate power.  New Hampshire has a similarly checkered predictive past as Pat Buchanan won in 1996, McCain in 2000, Paul Tsongas (1992) and Hillary (2008).</comment>

<comment>Hey, man, everyone knows Tsongas been running this country for the last 25 years.</comment>

<comment>The tennis player? Hell, he can't even make the semis of the US Open.Now Roger Federer, on the other hand . . . .</comment>

<comment>This is an original and interesting thought.</comment>

<comment>snert</comment>

<comment>Wow - noting that NH and Iowa are white states....what a fresh take!</comment>

<comment>She's special </comment>

<comment>I'm not entirely convinced of the efficacy of all these primaries to begin with. What's the actual difference between party hacks (who at least have an incentive to be pragmatic) selecting candidates and "the base" (which tends to piss away opportunities) doing so?But inasmuch as we have them I agree. Put the crucial primaries in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida, Michigan, or North Carolina. I know I'm biased as an exasperated Republican, but I don't see much logic in making or breaking candidates based on their appeal to "base" types in places like South Carolina or Iowa. If that makes me elitist then fine.</comment>

<comment>Also, taking the early race out of IA might release the vice grip the agribusiness lobby has on Congress's testicles.</comment>

<comment>I've worked both states in a presidential campaign (Howard Dean in '04). My take is to get rid of Iowa and keep New Hampshire.I completely get that New Hampshire isn't representative of the nation as a whole, but the people of the state take their 'first primary' status very seriously. They ask smart, probing questions, and will hold your feet to the fire if you try and foist off some kind of boilerplate BS on them.The people of Iowa, on the other hand, mostly seem to not really care all that much about the whole thing, except insofar as they can get the candidates to promise to keep the damned ethanol subsidy. And on the GOP side anyway, the furthest right fringes seem to have an even more disproportionate impact than in other states. That's how Ted Cruz wins this thing instead of Trump; Trump may have released the angry id of the party, but far right he ain't.</comment>

<comment>Con governor branstadt bashing Cruz over not supporting ethanol subsidies. The Socialist candidate trump, supports them. The republican party is a farce.</comment>

<comment>Still think Rubio ultimately gets the nomination.</comment>

<comment>You're probably right. </comment>

<comment>Still? He just won it and the presidency.</comment>

<comment>Being for Trump or Cruz is the equivalent of stating publicly that you like to get drunk and fap to photos of young women online.In other words... you have not a clue beyond your most base needs and immediate interests.</comment>

<comment>I like to do that from time to time. However, I would prefer Rubio win anyway.</comment>

<comment>Of course. If you're a Republican he wins easily in the general.</comment>

<comment>I would just prefer not to reward xenophobia, though Rubio's tone changed recently towards that.</comment>

<comment>Kind of obsessed with "fapping" there MG?</comment>

<comment>I fap to Melanie Martinez videos, but only after sobering up.Also, CNN just called Iowa for Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Wow, but I'm not voting fir Trump or Cruz...?</comment>

<comment>Cruz has no chance at all. He is thoroughly unlikable. Almost as much as Hillary.But he did derail the Trumpster. Allah be praised.</comment>

<comment>Saw a poll that said "25% of government employees would quit if Trump is elected"....And ? How is that a bad thing ?</comment>

<comment>Almost a reason to vote for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Just think of the savings.</comment>

<comment>The openings would be filled with new employees at 75% of the salary.</comment>

<comment>If it was true I would vote for Trump.The only things that can separate a public employee from their job are death or their pension vesting.</comment>

<comment>That does it, I'm voting for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Hmm, call Flint, Michigan.</comment>

<comment>Military?  That would be great savings.</comment>

<comment>They would never quit.  None of these people could cut in the private sector.</comment>

<comment>What about the white ones?</comment>

<comment>Well he is now officially irrelevant, so whatevs.</comment>

<comment>I sadly expect that Clinton wins tonight just from experience with this bizarre process, but that beginning tomorrow the phrase "operational intelligence" will become familiar to everyone, and by the time NH rolls around, they'll be fighting about swapping in Biden.</comment>

<comment>Just like at Thanksgiving, no one understands what you are blubbering about.</comment>

<comment>Am I the only one getting "Application Error" for the vote reporting app at the top of the article? Is this the Microsoft app that was developed for vote counting?</comment>

<comment>Could an ad blocker be causing the Application Error?</comment>

<comment>nope.  I was getting the same error too.  Disabled my ad blocker and refereshed.  Now the application doesn't load anything at all</comment>

<comment>Nope, I am on as plain a vanilla Wintel computer as my dead broke law firm employer could get away with (Obviously, not MY choice of OS). I am lucky it has a fully-functional version of Office. The app came back with a note saying there weren't any results. Then some results were reported in one of the comments and the app went away entirely.</comment>

<comment>Heavy rural turnout and lots of first time voters from both parties.  Trump and Sanders should do well.</comment>

<comment>Uh huh. White people voting for the first time. Oh goody.</comment>

<comment>It really is all about race to a racist.</comment>

<comment>Bubba, clear you mouth before you try to speak.(Didn't yo mamma teach you anything?)</comment>

<comment>You're terrible at trolling.</comment>

<comment>Broken. Record.</comment>

<comment>How did that go for Trump? Lol. Can't wait to see how all his supporters justify his beat down.</comment>

<comment>That was the big surprise for Trump but it almost put Sanders over the edge.</comment>

<comment>Iowa is irrelevant. No one wants to live there. Without the ethanol welfare, everyone would have left years ago...</comment>

<comment>Have you ever been to Iowa?</comment>

<comment>Sadly, yes I have.</comment>

<comment>And...what do you find so objectionable?</comment>

<comment>Have YOU actually been to Iowa?</comment>

<comment>Yes I have.  It's not a bad state.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. No, you haven't been there. It is a horrible state.</comment>

<comment>I've been there many time.  You can't tell me why it's a bad state.</comment>

<comment>Uh huh. Sure you have....</comment>

<comment>Lair. You have never been to Iowa.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. If you had actually ever been to Iowa you would not be defending it. It is a dreary state dependent on ethanol welfare. Without that subsidy (welfare) everyone would have moved away by now.</comment>

<comment>Iowa City is nice.It's a mini-Madison.</comment>

<comment>Uh... no. Not in any sane person's wildest dreams.It is a dreary state with nothing to at all to recommend it.Sorry.</comment>

<comment>Iowa City is kinda cool. Davenport is nice. Des Moines beats Akron or Shreveport, anyway</comment>

<comment>Shreveport is not a high bar.</comment>

<comment>Eastern Iowa is lovely. Western Iowa is Nebraska with a four-year God complex.</comment>

<comment>Drove through the state on a cross-country road trip in my early 20s.  Was pleasantly surprised; I had expected corn fields and dreariness, but Iowa city was a nice college town, and most of the state was very green with rolling hills and such.  What I had thought was Iowa, was actually Nebraska (though western Nebraska has a desolate, Western charm).</comment>

<comment>Iowa is where the food comes from.  It's second only to California in agricultural receipts and I expect if you consider California grows things like almonds which are way more expensive than corn.and soybeans you may find Iowa actually provides more calories.</comment>

<comment>A small suggestion  for  the Atlantic editors. When a post is "live blogging" it  would improve the posts if the posts automaticly refreshed whenever there was a new post.  Ive seen it done before at the Atlantic.Not sure as to why its not being done tonight</comment>

<comment>Hey looky look: people are actually VOTING for BEN CARSON!How insane and stupid is THAT??Is it some sort of Iowan white person "protest" vote?</comment>

<comment>When they get caught forwarding racist emails, they will get to say they caucused for Carson. </comment>

<comment>Carnival barking ignoramus, Trump, is losing. But, he is losing to Cruz. Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯ </comment>

<comment>Yeah, but Rubio just won the presidency.</comment>

<comment>Someone voted for OMalley.</comment>

<comment>Im surprised at how much support Carson and Paul are getting.Both had pretty much been written off as finished . But their supporters may yet throw their support behind another candidate by the end of the night</comment>

<comment>I dont think the GOP caucuses work that way. People cast their votes and thats it. </comment>

<comment>But Carson is essentially a mannequin. Paul at least can move his mouth.</comment>

<comment>Looks as though Rubio is getting over that 20% threshold mentioned in the article. Not a big fan, but I have to give him credit for his gains in the last week.</comment>

<comment>k2togp2togAtt he moment,Rubio is only a little behind Trump. I think that Trump can survive a 2nd place finish.But would be hurt badly by a third place finish.And would be destroyed by a 4th place finish. Trump's campaign isn't built to withstand defeatsIf Rubio does well tonight, it makes me wonder if  a lot of mainstream Republicans will throw their support his way.To stop Trump and/or Cruz. If so, that would end Bush's campaign</comment>

<comment>Yes, I think that's a fair analysis. I also think that the wild card in all of this is how Trump responds to a second or third place finish....remember his meltdown when he first fell behind Cruz in one of the polls? He called the Iowa voters "stupid". Not sure that more of that will play well in the rest of the US.</comment>

<comment>Where is schizo Donald?</comment>

<comment>I'm trolling the white supremacist trolls tonight, they're not at all happy.</comment>

<comment>Where are they? I'll join you</comment>

<comment>https://forum.therightstuff.bi...</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I thought they were on the Atlantic. Can't bring myself to go to that site. Good luck.</comment>

<comment>I love the reek of abject failure, it goes well with this wine ;-)</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I am not heading over there either. As much as I would enjoy watching our Trumpettes wail and cry....</comment>

<comment>I bet Iowa doesn't matter now. </comment>

<comment>In the immortal words of one of their drunk heroes, "You betcha!"</comment>

<comment>One thing is for certain, Palin is not a Kingmaker.</comment>

<comment>Pretty much, and an immediate end to ethanol subsidies in a Trump presidency . . . . oddly enough</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It is, and I'm done with it. Little deflated paper tigers.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Totally agree.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough. But Dems just lost the presidency.</comment>

<comment>Crying into his beer, maybe?</comment>

<comment>Cruz lead widening. I knew people were trolling the polls.</comment>

<comment>Rubio family praying. I'm really sick of seeing a contest among the candidates to out-Jesus each other. I'd gladly vote for someone who says he or she never prays, but that is not likely. At least Bernie seems to be non religious. </comment>

<comment>And it's the public=prayer types that can't wait to invade Iran or kill the guy in Syria.Sick of the phony-ass "Christians."</comment>

<comment>Strong night for my man, Marco.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>My how the times have changed.Tea Party-candidate Marco Rubio is the most "establishment" of the top four vote getters.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I agree.  He is very talented.That said, he doesn't seem to draw the RAGE vote and that's the question:Do you need enraged voters to be enthusiastic for you to win the Republican nomination in 2016?I think is his life narrative also plays well.  He's from modest means.  Ted Cruz is "anti-establishment" elitist.  Rubio isn't.  I think Rubio's empty savings account is actually appealing.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, there's a huge opening for Rubio.  Cruz is vulnerable.  Trump is vulnerable.I think, at the end of the day, most voters will:1) Want more than entertainment (although I can't stand him, Trump is very entertaining)2) Not want an angry guy all the time. Cruz is the angry guy.  I think that 4 years of Ted Cruz being president would just be extremely irritating.It will be interesting to see what happens now with Rubio.  Big night for him and a lot more scrutiny to come.  I want to see if he can really do the marathon campaigning thing in the spotlight or if he wilts a bit.Also will be interesting to see if this catapults him ahead of the establishment pack in NH.Good night for the GOP and Rubio.  Things are very open.</comment>

<comment>Talented at what, exactly?Memorizing speeches to please his sugardaddy?</comment>

<comment>Yeah I think he's a very quick, fluent speaker, and he's bright.Marco's a smart guy.I'd like to see more though.The focus on Carson/Trump/Cruz means Marco hasn't received the scrutiny he should.</comment>

<comment>Who is beating him now?</comment>

<comment>Or times went exactly as rationale people thought they would. As a Dem, I'm now sick to my stomach.</comment>

<comment>He just won the presidency.</comment>

<comment>Gary Johnson sure looks to be having a good night.</comment>

<comment>Trump could actually finish third. Lol, i wonder if he regrets skipping the debate, and Palin.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It's looking more and more like you were right.</comment>

<comment>I don't think the debate thing made any difference.  I think that when push came to shove, a lot of people just couldn't bring themselves to vote for Trump.  Especially since Iowa voting is public.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It's a counterfactual, so we'll never know.  I will say that the idea of a "serious voter" voting for Donald Trump seems oxymoronic to me.</comment>

<comment>OMG if you are right we will never hear the end of it .</comment>

<comment>No pizza for you, again.</comment>

<comment>TRUMP WILL RULE THIS NATION BECAUSE HE IS THE ONLY REAL MAN FOR THE JOB.</comment>

<comment>Eh. His problem was that he was always Trump. </comment>

<comment>CNN now reporting that Martin O'Malley will suspend his campaign tonight.</comment>

<comment>Wow.... that's a surprise.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. I am no fan (neither I, nor most other people in MD, of both parties), but I really thought he'd try to hang on through New Hampshire.</comment>

<comment>Why? He had nothing - why continue a futile ego exercise.Maybe his Clinton payments ran out...</comment>

<comment>He was doing some campaigning in NH, and I just thought he'd stick it out. But....it's pretty hard to save face after a 0% loss!</comment>

<comment>k2togp2togSame here. My theory has always  been that he was trying to be the Michael Dukakis of 2016.Dukakis was pretty much a nobody  in the 88 Election.Until Gary Hart  's campaign imploded.Omalley has been waiting for Clinton's campaign to implode.But since he is aiming for the same types of voters as hers, he couldnt be the one to be seen putting he knife inSanders is running neck and neck with Clinton tonight. If Sanders defeats Clinton in Iowa and NH, one would think that  this might cause some Clinton supporters to throw   their support to OMalley instead</comment>

<comment>BUT HOW WILL WE KNOW</comment>

<comment>k2togp2togIt will be interesting to see who OMalley voters in Iowa throw their support to tonight. He's only getting .50%  of the vote.But that's enough to win the state for either Clinton or Sanders. Clinton is only  about .50% ahead at the moment</comment>

<comment>Correction:O'Malley voter.  His mom moved to Iowa or something.</comment>

<comment>President Cruz.... it just rolls off the lipsAnd then you want to punch him in the face.ha ha</comment>

<comment>#ElliesSoWhite. Not impressed, Atlantic.</comment>

<comment>#failSoBad</comment>

<comment>I love number symbol phrases!</comment>

<comment>No, you suck. Accept it.</comment>

<comment>That's okay, I love you too, sweetie!</comment>

<comment>No. You do suck.You are an arsehole and no doubt everyone in your RL would agree. You have always been the arsehole, ever since high school. Why not just accept it.</comment>

<comment>So, the real question now is whether Trump even makes it Super Tuesday.  His aura of being a "winner" is now gone, and given the absurd nature of his campaign it is not coming back.  Here's the question: can Rubio win NH or finish a close 2nd?  If he can, it becomes a two man race between him and Cruz.  That race will be the political equivalent of a nuclear war, though Rubio will almost certainly win.  If Kasich (or Bush) finishes ahead of Rubio in NH, which is possible, then everything is back up in the air.</comment>

<comment>He already expressed exasperation about the "stupid" people in Iowa.  This will just confirm it.  He gets to say "I told you so."</comment>

<comment>But, how many voters will support a blowhard who treats the public with that much contempt?</comment>

<comment>More than anyone would expect, apparently.</comment>

<comment>Yo, yo â€“ a cooking question:Ham hocks add flavor, I get that â€“ but some recipes then direct them to be served.Huh? A ham hock is mostly fat, skin, bone and gristle. What is there to eat in that?</comment>

<comment>I have always pulled some of the ham meat off the hock, added that into the dish, and discarded the rest.</comment>

<comment>Yeah â€“ that is what I am doing (only my 2nd time with ham hocks) but I am confused sine some recipes shoe them actually being served.Am I missing something? The joy of ham hock fat?</comment>

<comment>I've found it more glutinous than delicious, and I've thrown it out!</comment>

<comment>Me too, kind of "ugh" â€“ but some recipes actually serve the ham hocks so it left me wondering.</comment>

<comment>At the same time, I recognize that I have been fortunate enough to be able to discard the stuff. I understand not everyone would make that choice.</comment>

<comment>Its not bad, you ever eat bacon?</comment>

<comment>Crawl back in your troll hole.</comment>

<comment>Whats your problem?</comment>

<comment>MY problem is YOU replying to my comments.You are an ARSEHOLE. So please don't bother replying.Are we clear?</comment>

<comment>Bacon is gooood</comment>

<comment>My handle used to be mean dude.</comment>

<comment>That just encourages me to respond, lol</comment>

<comment>Yeah.... because you are a sad, lonely fcuk.Why do you want everyone to know that?</comment>

<comment>Do you really think Trump will win?</comment>

<comment>meoooww</comment>

<comment>Historically, people ate those tissues too. From excavations of landfills, it's been shown than more fat and gristle was left on cuts of meat during good economic times. During times of financial strife, people were more likely to eat fat and connective tissue.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Eat everything from the rootah to the tootah.</comment>

<comment>Yes, including bone marrow. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Now THAT explains a lot.</comment>

<comment>At fine restaurants, you'll find shanks served with a marrow fork.</comment>

<comment>Fascinating. Edible, and digestible, cutlery. </comment>

<comment>Yeah, edible cutlery </comment>

<comment>I've always though lamb marrow was better tasting than lamb meat</comment>

<comment>I like both, but marrow is sooo good spread on some bread</comment>

<comment>Another loss in Trumps long list of failures. Can't wait to see how the loser spins this.</comment>

<comment>It's not really a loss when each candidate received 5 delegates each.</comment>

<comment>Only 16 delegates of 30 assigned so far.  If the %'s hold up, we'd expect Cruz to come out 1-2 delegates ahead.</comment>

<comment>Kinduva loss, for the yuuge and beautiful Trump</comment>

<comment>So - Rubio, Cruz and Trump at 75%.Two questions:1) who gets the majority of that 25% when the pretenders drop out?2) what happens when it turns into a two (man) race?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I dunno - Cruz is pretty ruthless.</comment>

<comment>Trump is about to go nuclear.</comment>

<comment>Ah, what fun that will be. I should make popcorn.</comment>

<comment>"Cruz is pretty ruthless."ha ha. Understatement?Even his kids are afraid of him.</comment>

<comment>I don't think this is quite right.  The relevant number is Cruz + Rubio, who are at about 50%.  Trump is about to crater, so the entire remaining 50% are up in the air.</comment>

<comment>Good point.  My friends and I think that his decision to blow off the debate was the beginning of his self-sabotage campaign.  Shit was starting to get real.</comment>

<comment>I've wondered if his entire campaign was an attempt at self-sabotage.  He just kept dialing it up and his numbers kept increasing.  I never thought he wanted to be president.  But I'm sure he thinks he could do the job in his sleep.</comment>

<comment>Oof, Donald Trump Jr is not a man you want to send among the people. Deer hunting? Does anybody believe he actually does that in any way where the outcome isn't badly fixed?</comment>

<comment>How did Clinton already get  400 plus delegates?</comment>

<comment>DWS</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a fix.</comment>

<comment>Meh, I like Bernie more, even though he proposes crazy Ñ•hit, but he actually seems to care about people. Clinton in the safer electoral bet, however. </comment>

<comment>Clinton is a shrew.</comment>

<comment>Some would call it prudent. She's just a continuation of the Bush-Obama years. I'll do well regardless of who is elected. Go white privilege! </comment>

<comment>She's just a continuation of the Bush-Obama yearsOr maybe she's the end and the beginning of the Clinton-Bush-Obama-Clinton ouroboros!</comment>

<comment>Followed by George P. Bush and then Malia or Chelsea? Go dynasties!  </comment>

<comment>Obela Super Delegates</comment>

<comment>Superdelegates.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is now only one point behind Trump, with Cruz 4 points ahead of him. This is from CNN with 97% of the vote.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I should correct that - CNN says that's 97% of the expected caucus goers, but with high turnout, there could be some more. Sorry. It was confusing.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie had more calories than votes today.</comment>

<comment>Oh looky look: a sad troll crying for attention.Ok. Here is a reply cookie. Now go away.</comment>

<comment>How do you two not get along? Two unrelenting, uncompromising hotheads? Bring on Bradan, or Nadim, or Garrett, whatever for the hat-trick!  </comment>

<comment>It's funny watch a troll calling someone a troll.</comment>

<comment>Did he more votes than OMalley?</comment>

<comment>Democrats don't caucus with a head count so it's impossible to know.</comment>

<comment>If he eats O'Malley would he get his votes?</comment>

<comment>eventually.</comment>

<comment>Votes for Chris Christie according to the NYTimes: 3,277Recommended daily caloric intake assumption used for FDA food labeling: 2,000 - 2,500 calories.Heh, you might be right :P</comment>

<comment>Ah....Karl Rove is now on Fox.  I don't believe they brought him out until the precincts hit 99%.They didn't want him to start ranting from his white board that "it's not over until we count the ex-urbs of Davenport!!!"It's not often that you see a career melt down like his spectacular flame-out in 2012.</comment>

<comment>The CNN anchors have made the point that 1) Republicans are angry at the establishment, and 2) Iowa and New Hampshire are really white.Now - THAT'S some fresh insight!</comment>

<comment>Mmm.... Republicans ARE the establishment.</comment>

<comment>That's a funny delusion from your tribe.  I recall Meryl Streep getting a picture in a tee shirt saying, simply, "Rebel."  The ultimate Hollywood insider who still thinks she is a rebel.You guys own all of academia, most of the new economy entrepreneurs, most of the media, Hollywood and the Executive Branch.We have Fox News, the WSJ and Waco, TX.</comment>

<comment>And a wildlife refuge in BFE Oregon....at least for another couple days.</comment>

<comment>Which leads to an interesting question. Why?</comment>

<comment>A crappy economy, the Iraq War and 25 years of indoctrination from academia.</comment>

<comment>So why does the right have trouble creating 'conservative' entertainment, and 'conservative' academia?</comment>

<comment>Non hard science academia is simply the refuge of the 60's who are at the peak of their careers.  Go to the engineering schools and you will find normal people.</comment>

<comment>I have a B. Eng. Lots of leftwingers in Engineering. The 'here to make a difference' types.</comment>

<comment>and lots of middle of the roaders and lots of right wingers.  To find the monolithically kneejerky left, you have to go across the campus.</comment>

<comment>Which leads me back to my original question. If the conservatives are mad at liberal dominance in the liberal arts, why don't they do something about it?</comment>

<comment>They should start the conservative arts. Drowning puppies, taking candy away from poor kids, bringing back work camps, stuff like that.</comment>

<comment>It takes a few decades to create another Harvard.And - there is the occasional conservative entertainment - "American Sniper" for example.  Pretty big market.</comment>

<comment>JJM, you know that if there was a 'Pretty big market', you wouldn't be talking about 'occasional' conservative entertainment.Right now, conservative entertainment seems more of a niche. Odd that no one has really tried to specialize and fill that niche.</comment>

<comment>Fox News, the WSJ and "American Sniper" are three examples.Mostly, Hollywood is chasing the Asian market and the kids.</comment>

<comment>And lets not even talk about comedians. Do they have any?</comment>

<comment>The guy who made Idiocracy and King of the Hill?</comment>

<comment>You have Oklahoma. What more do you want? New Mexico?</comment>

<comment>Great point.  I doubt mean girl has the depth to understand it.</comment>

<comment>Sorry. Not interested in your "me so victim" whine. Try it with your wife.</comment>

<comment>You are the saddest troll on this site.</comment>

<comment>Never said I was a victim.I have done quite well in the Obama economy.  I already had money and - for a few years - the Fed made it a turkey shoot to make even more money.Just pointing out the obvious fact that many on the left still think it's 1968 and they are the brave young rebels.The counter-culture is now on the right.</comment>

<comment>Now that's interesting. How do you figure?</comment>

<comment>"We" could have it all, if people like you didn't have so many mental and emotional issues.After Obama won the first time - something that was 100% preventable - we needed a smart, sane, pro-American, big tent opposition to the far-left on cultural issues.Instead, we got a dumb, deranged, anti-American, small tent pretend-opposition to Obama on mostly economic issues.</comment>

<comment>which gave rise to Trump.</comment>

<comment>"something that was 100% preventable"Not after 8 years of Bush and the possibility of VPOTUS Sarah Palin.</comment>

<comment>Choosing McCain and Palin were other signs of the idiocracy of which I speak.Another, relatively minor example of many was Ace of Spades (the blogger) leading his readers on to believe that Ben Smith (then of Politico) was going to find and publicize the mythical "Whitey Tape".Twenty one other examples of pre-Obama idiocy here:24ahead.com/n/8224</comment>

<comment>Palin yes, but I disagree with you on McCain. I think he had a reasonable shot.</comment>

<comment>I cannot wait to watch Trump go nuclear on Rubio.  I mean, the story basically writes itself.  Rubio is soft on immigration, he is a corporate puppet, he hasn't done anything, etc.  At the same time, Cruz has already started his own nuclear war against Rubio and that is only going to get worse.  It is not going to be a straightforward path for Rubio.  In fact, we will now finally see what he has as a politician.</comment>

<comment>In short.... Rubio is soft. Squishy soft. Baby Wa Wa soft.In other words, a complete poser/egotist/wannabe</comment>

<comment>It's coming, for sure.  And the irony is that it now makes perfect sense for Trump and Cruz to renew their bromance in the interest of destroying their common enemy.  Get your popcorn ready!</comment>

<comment>And, your standard bearer may get indicted.</comment>

<comment>Blow me. You don't have a clue who my "standard bearer" is.You sad, despicable fcuk.</comment>

<comment>you seem nice...</comment>

<comment>Oh, you are for Hillary.  A lonely, vicious, aging, congenital liar - in other words, birds of a feather</comment>

<comment>As I said, blow me. You don't have a fcuking clue.You reveal your own issues with your pathetic whining.\Women issues?Mama issues?ha ha. You sad fcuk.</comment>

<comment>How do you blow a girl?</comment>

<comment>How does one "blow" a chick?  That's a new one!</comment>

<comment>The "Hillary is getting indicted" thing is childish.  The only place she's getting indicted is in the GOP fever swamps, and she has already received the death penalty over there.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - the FBI has 150 agents working on it - because of the vast right wing conspiracy.Sure - it's possible we are now Venezuela and that the DOJ will simply shut it down.</comment>

<comment>It's a big rug...lots of sweeping needed.</comment>

<comment>John you are going to be so disappointed.....again.</comment>

<comment>I mean, have you actually followed the details of this investigation and Hillary's supposed wrongdoing?  It is basically a regulatory dispute between government agencies about how certain documents should be classified.  There is precisely a 0.0% chance that Clinton is going to be indicted.  If Republicans can beat her, go for it.  But they shouldn't think the FBI is going to do the job for them.</comment>

<comment>Yes I have.Your spin about an "intra-agency" dispute worked until the State Dept's news on the Friday news dump.Plus, you have no idea what's going on the 30K deleted emails that were recovered or the possible ties to the Foundation.The NYT and Fox News appear to have pretty good sources inside the FBI.  Everyone else is just repeating their news.</comment>

<comment>Ok, good luck with all that.  Just trying to prepare you for the inevitable disappointment.</comment>

<comment>Oh I think Obama will try to quash the FBI.The real action will be how big of a stink they make.  They were pissed that Petraeus got a slap on the wrist.</comment>

<comment>Being "soft" on immigration is being with a majority of the American people, though you wouldn't know it in the Republican primary.</comment>

<comment>Oh, I think Rubio is screwed on immigration from all sides.  The only thing he accomplished in Congress was immigration reform, and then he completely crapped on the very bill he helped write.  He has no position on immigration, which is not good at this point.</comment>

<comment>I think you are right. Plus Rubio looks like he is 14 years old. President of the scout troop maybe.</comment>

<comment>All the talk in this thread seems to be about Trump .And other Republicans.But it seems to me that the excitement is in the Democratic Party race tonight. I have to admit, that I didn't expect Sanders to do so well tonight</comment>

<comment>Huckabee just suspended his campaign. Good riddance!</comment>

<comment>Well gee... I am fcuking surprised.Has old Huck considered that he has shined his "brand" enough and he doesn't need to continue? Did he get an offer from Fox?Huckabee is a vile scumbag parading in some kinky "uncle bunny" clothing.</comment>

<comment>And he defended the child molester, Josh Duggar.</comment>

<comment>Don't try to suck up to me, you scumbag troll.</comment>

<comment>MG, i think you have me confused with someone else. I agree with you on almost everything, sans Hillary. FeeltheBern babe.  Go and read my posts. </comment>

<comment>Is the profile pic confusing you?</comment>

<comment>Okay you owe me for however much alcohol it takes to get that image out of my head. </comment>

<comment>Gonna take a lot.The Hucker...sucker is a compelling beast</comment>

<comment>He's probably trying to crawl back to the media. I don't know why he gave up his TV show in the first place (because of equal time laws) after he resisted the temptation in 2012. Maybe ratings were down?</comment>

<comment>I figured he and Google Santorum both dropped out last Thursday, when they showed up at the Trump debate skipping event.</comment>

<comment>2008 Huckabee, 2012 Santorum, 2016 Cruz... wow White Religious Iowa, really thinking outside the box.</comment>

<comment>Trump may want a do-over on skipping that debate. Amateur.</comment>

<comment>And picking Palin</comment>

<comment>God, that was dumb. He already had the Teabilly vote.</comment>

<comment>Its like his only endorsement. And she is still cute. What could he do?</comment>

<comment>That christianist guy...Failwell.</comment>

<comment>That's not true! He was also endorsed by another insufferable ahole who flamed out earlier this year than his loudmouth supporters predicted!</comment>

<comment>Rubio is their best bet, but he is basically the 3rd term of george bush policy wise. He is all about biography.</comment>

<comment> i love to see Trump beaten off his high horse. </comment>

<comment>I read a tweet that pointed out that - once again - the polls SUCKED.Over-predicted support for Hillary (she led by 5 points) and Trump by quite a bit and under-counted support for Rubio and Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Someone should beat up that Nate Silver guy.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - his raw material - polls - are now fool's gold.</comment>

<comment>He warned repeatedly that caucus polls were highly unreliable.</comment>

<comment>Exactly </comment>

<comment>The Atlantic has been named "Magazine of the Year."Congratulations on your Ellie.  I don't see any award for below the line commentator of the year, so you should start one.  You can call them the Smellies.</comment>

<comment>If it wasn't for the vibrant commenting community, you wouldn't be here, I assume. And who wants to exist in an echo chamber? </comment>

<comment>I wasn't being sarcastic.Edit: 'Mean Girl' has just shown me there is a swearing ban here.  I never realised that, I obviously don't swear that much and assumed the rest of you didn't either.  That explains why my comment quoting Bertolt Brecht on European fascism was moderated.  To me, that is akin to the Italians covering up nude statues for the Iranian President, but I guess I can self-censor."Do not rejoice in his defeat, you men. For though the world has stood up and stopped the [illegitimate man], the [female dog] that bore him is in heat again." - Brecht, The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui</comment>

<comment>She hates Mexicans.</comment>

<comment>She isn't smart enough to know that.Not sure she is a she.</comment>

<comment>She's mean. I was once with a mean girl, I gave her herpes to settle the score.</comment>

<comment>you sad fcuk. Don't try to snivel your way up to the level of humans. You suck. Go down with the other Republicans.</comment>

<comment>She's attacking everyone. Scorched earth. </comment>

<comment>Marco acts as if our military has disbanded. </comment>

<comment>We have less artillery cannons and canvas pantaloons than in 1847 tho!!!</comment>

<comment>I just don't get his angle.</comment>

<comment>God, Marco is a huge douchenozzle.  I cant believe I used to vote predominantly Republican.</comment>

<comment>Iowa continues its tradition of picking Republican losers.  Cruz will be hocking goldline bars with Glenn Beck next year.  That fraudulent televangelist has no chance!</comment>

<comment>Every time people have counted Trump out, he's surged in the polls. But this is an actual contest. It actually counts. Trump's mistake was raising expectations not to mention having zero ground organization. Had he put together a minimal effort, he might have given Cruz a run for his money. Had he stated the obviousâ€¦ that Iowa is NOT a good state for him, he would have been the story tonight in a good way. Instead the story is Rubio. Trump has ten times the votes of Bush, but he looks like a loser. The guy whose brand is all about winning is a loser in his first contest.</comment>

<comment>Can the Koch brothers just buy this guy a public speaking tutor already?   He sounds like he's running for class president of the 8th grade.  Get him a water bottle.</comment>

<comment>He is insufferable.</comment>

<comment>He came in third.  I can't imagine how hyperbolic his speech will be if he wins a state.</comment>

<comment>He'll shIt himself on stage</comment>

<comment>Its a high 3. He wanted to come out as the establishment guy and probably did that. Now we get to see if there is enough establishment left to get him over the finish line.</comment>

<comment>He does remind me of the kid in front of the class with his hand up and the answers written on his cuffs.</comment>

<comment>Palin?</comment>

<comment>No she was the cheerleader banging half the football team.</comment>

<comment>Basketball team</comment>

<comment>That would be less impressive.</comment>

<comment>Not as impressive, but more believable. Remember the Glen Rice rumors?</comment>

<comment>Pssst, come join us cool kids and leave this place to the trolls: https://disqus.com/home/channe...</comment>

<comment>Just watched the water bottle speech the other night. Funny shyt.</comment>

<comment>Why is Rubio giving a victory speech?  Has he lost his mind?</comment>

<comment>Participation trophies all around!</comment>

<comment>When you are small and your campaign writes your name in lower case, 3rd place is like Olympic gold.</comment>

<comment>I got third place, so i am going to tell you how i will play Army.</comment>

<comment>He was the Risk champion of Dade County.</comment>

<comment>Lol</comment>

<comment>The Iowa caucus is, historically, a very poor predictor of the republican nominee. This is a setback for Trump, but we're not rid of him yet.Clinton and Sanders are still dead heat last I looked, but I don't know that their final standing will matter much either way. The only pivotal thing about tonight for the Democrats is getting rid of O'Malley.</comment>

<comment>Gettign rid of who?</comment>

<comment>Trump lost Iowa by 6,000 votes in a caucus.  I think people are burying him a little prematurely.</comment>

<comment>No whine here. Now about hamhocks, they are great for seasoning, bacon also does a great job. Were you cooking greens?</comment>

<comment>Yes. You are a sad, pathetic fcuk. Constantly lonely, isolated, paranoid. You are the prototypical TRUMP voter.You sad fcuk. Get some help.</comment>

<comment>Omg, you are an idiot. I phucking hate the carnival barker. I only been saying it all night, and for months.</comment>

<comment>Well, he just predicted he'd win big in NH .....we'll see.</comment>

<comment>Considering how he constantly reminded us of his lead in the polls, i'd say its a bigger loss, especially for his ego. </comment>

<comment>Trump just congratulated everybody else in the race, including Huckabee, who just dropped out.</comment>

<comment>Ivanka looking hot as ever</comment>

<comment>Not relevant. :-|   <---- stone-faced</comment>

<comment>She was on stage wasn't she?</comment>

<comment>Clinton will eat Cruz for lunch.And barf him up later.</comment>

<comment>It's going to be Rubio and unless Trump voters bolt from the Republican party, it's going to be a very difficult general election race.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is a child.</comment>

<comment>Yeah but they'll market him like the perfect little center-right forward-looking Ken doll.</comment>

<comment>Hillary will eat him for breakfast.</comment>

<comment>Whatever, Trump will never win. Get used to it.</comment>

<comment>Iowa has only picked one Republican who ended up as president.Props to O'Malley for bowing out. Now Carson and every Republican beneath him need to do the same.</comment>

<comment>I dont see el gordo dropping out. He's put all his eggs in NH</comment>

<comment>Yeah they picked George W Bush. Thanks a lot.</comment>

<comment>They also gave Carter his jump-start.  Thanks a lot.</comment>

<comment>Well at least Carter didn't invade Egypt because Iranian hostages.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - Carter sent helicopters to crash in the desert after wringing his hands for a few hundred days.</comment>

<comment>The mission failed, an people died. Same thing could have happened when Obama got Osama. Its a risk of the trade.He could have made a war over it and didn't. That was the right choice.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Trump had a concession speech prepared.</comment>

<comment>New Hampshire will be a pretty big deal.  If Trump loses there, then it's a race...</comment>

<comment>It's a race no matter what.  What matters most in NH is who finishes where.  I actually think it's possible Kasich wins outright, which would really make it a race.  His profile for NH is equivalent to Cruz's profile for IA.</comment>

<comment>Trump just said he was buying the farm in Iowa. I think he already did.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>And I half expected him to. But you could tell he was lying when he said he'd buy a farm there. Sounded like a used car salesman.</comment>

<comment>He is a used condo tower salesman.</comment>

<comment>Wolf Blitzer just tried to say OMG, and said, "Oh ah, M  G as they say". He was reacting to the tightening race between Bernie and Hillary...49.8 to 49.6 percent.</comment>

<comment>Bernies numbers do not add up. To do what he wants, create a northern Euro welfare state, would take large broad based tax increases that are not politically palatable in the US. But, God bless him for  painting this picture for us at long last.</comment>

<comment>He owns several and knows how to use them. Which is unlike any Republican tax cut to balance the budget proposal.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't have to votes to o much of any of that. But at least john, all of those things would be actual use to people. Its basically Germany. We could do a lot worse.</comment>

<comment>The HRC Death Star will paint Bernie as a racist.  And there will be a great disturbance in the Force as millions of under-30 white liberals will cry out as if they are dead.</comment>

<comment>Nah - he's just as bewildered as I am by "Black Lives Matter."</comment>

<comment>Not a good feeling to have if you want the black vote.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I doubt that considering all you do is harass black posters.When did black people magically fall in love with Trump? The black pastors he met with laughed in his face.</comment>

<comment>Black Americans don't vote for Republicans.</comment>

<comment>They will vote for HRC > Bernie.</comment>

<comment>Of course they will, Hispanics too. Hillary appeals to both groups more.Bernie needs to work on his outreach to minorities. He's popular with Asians however.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Its like you don't want to use historical trends and are just saying things.Again, no Democrat has gotten less than 86% of the black vote, with high levels of political polarization, any defections are rare. Getting your side out to vote is more important.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm not. I call you out on your ignorance of minorities which seems to based on nothing but movies and stereotypes.</comment>

<comment>Well - Trump's whole act is like a rapper.</comment>

<comment>Yes even a socialist is better than a criminal - Bernie needs to count the votes. Don't Trust the Clinton counters. </comment>

<comment>Have the Trumpets and Trumpettes gotten bored with winning yet?</comment>

<comment>GHWB, Clinton and Reagan all lost Iowa- Go Trump!!And he had no ground game, called Iowans stupid, missed the last debate, and he's far from Evangelical who came out for Cruz.</comment>
