<comment>Universities should act to protect students, but the most unsettled students should learn that campus authorities cannot end all threats. College life ought to prepare young people for the slings and arrows of adulthood. Administrators are mostly well-meaning, or scared enough of becoming the next national story to act as though they're well-meaning.</comment>

<comment>True enough. But vigilance is required to ensure that the admin people are not slacking or failing to pull their pants up.</comment>

<comment>I don't doubt these students really feel this way.I do doubt whether their feelings have any basis in objective reality. Look at the catalog of horribles: a noose hung from a tree, a single poster defaced, and some mean comments. And all this in a University of about fifteen thousand students, plus who knows how many professors and other employees.The total disconnect here seems to be that these students are just unable to say: "In a place where 15,000 young people are in close proximity, a few bad things will happen."Duke students are among the most privileged in the entire world. If they can't go to sleep for fear of being killed, they need psychiatric treatment, not meetings with the dean. They have lost all perspective.</comment>

<comment>No, that will not do. These are not random acts. Malicious but not random.</comment>

<comment>This is about enforcing political discipline.It's ideological goose stepping through the town square.It's a show of political power.These "offenses" are just a pretext.</comment>

<comment>Not random? Are you saying there is some kind of racist conspiracy at Duke University? If you're going to claim that, let's see your evidence.</comment>

<comment>The noose?</comment>

<comment>A single noose? Hung on a tree outside? That could have been a drunken prank? A dare? Performance art? A cowardly racist?That means nothing. Fifteen thousand people is a small town. People will occasionally do bad things. It's not a conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>To say it might be a drunken prank, a dare, or performance art is to trivialize the act. Considering the political struggle against racism, it would make sense that those who feel threatened are responding with more racism.While I don't think that the noose indicates a direct threat to anyone, it's quite clearly an expression of rage and racism. The intent to offend and scare is absolutely clear.While there isn't a giant conspiracy out there, there is a concerted effort by the racists who feel threatened to exert power through hurt, offense, and reminding of the past. It's absolutely malicious and organized, but organized within the small set of racists who have decided to fight back. It's similar to the white supremacists who opened fire on BLM protesters in Minnesota, although much more suggestive as opposed to directly violent.</comment>

<comment>OK. Let's assume you are right. There is truly a very small subset of virulent racists at Duke.So what? They are not in the administration, which bends over backward to welcome minorities and offers massive admission preferences. Do you really think these racist Duke students, if they exist, are actually going to lynch someone? What are these students "scared" is going to happen that would keep a psychologically healthy person up at night?</comment>

<comment>These racists are dangerous, and as the political struggle has increased, they have acted out more. Dylan Roof comes to mind and the shooting in Minnesota as well. These are isolated, rare incidents, but the U.S. and the south in particular has a history of such incidents. So it's important to acknowledge that there is a basis for the fear these students feel and it is important for the administration to try and address such issues more strongly.At the same time, the reaction that these student activists have had to many of these things, the way that they act at these town hall meetings, the overwhelming sense of fear, doom, and catastrophe is overdramatic and unfounded.</comment>

<comment>You think Dylan Roof attended Duke?</comment>

<comment>These kids are growing up in a digital age that significantly amplifies threats and unfortunately the ease of making threats. It seems overdramatic and unfounded to those even slightly older, but I don't doubt that it is psychologically wearing.</comment>

<comment>I agree that racists are dangerous - just go to any large city in America to see how dangerous.  But in your little college community, if you're all a-twitter because someone called you a bad name, then you will never survive outside of the bubble of collegiate existence.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats were historically the party of the klan, and I don't hear any of these terrified students demanding the dismantling of the party.  It's pretty hard to trivialize something as trivial as a single noose hung in a tree.  The vast majority of all of these incidents turn out to be students trying to manufacture outrage at a pretense because they can't find any of these terrifying racists you're all so scared of.  I bring news.  For every actual Dylan Roof, there are literally thousands of inner city killings, not to mention car accidents.  If racism scares you today, it's because you need a remedial math class.</comment>

<comment>Is that how you feel about radical Islamic terrorism as well?</comment>

<comment>Is what how I feel about radical Islamic terrorists?  People have a right to freedom of speech, not a right to freedom from speech, clearly that includes Muslims.  There can be no comparison made between someone who sells twelve year old girls as sex slaves and murders hundreds of people and people who say scary sounding things to co-eds.  It's sad that so many co-eds don't get that.</comment>

<comment>You misunderstood and it's a shame I wasn't more clear. You're right that radical Islamic terrorists are worse than people who say mean scary things. Can't argue that.But you said Is that how you feel about Americans who are scared of Muslims because of Jihadist terrorism?  </comment>

<comment>Absolutely.  It terrifies me that the French are standing in line to give away their rights to their government.  Do you realize the temporary constitutional changes they've enacted include the right to dissolve association?  Coming to a university near you.</comment>

<comment>Ooohhh, scary.  Fear, doom, scary thoughts and words that hurt.  Tell it to the Yazidis.</comment>

<comment>"These racists are dangerous, and as the political struggle has increased, they have acted out more."Actually, that's objectively false.  Such acts haven't increased, they've decreased; and the violent acts have in fact seen the greatest decrease.  This is fairly easily referenced.</comment>

<comment>Please elaborate on "bending over backwards" to help minorities. It certainly doesn't seem like it when a noose is hung on campus....</comment>

<comment>How in the world do you think the Duke administration could prevent one mischief-maker from hanging a noose?By "bending over backwards," I mean massive admissions outreach including significant admissions preferences, minority-only scholarships, and whole departments devoted to race studies, among other things.The campus is so anti-racist that when three lacrosse players were accused of gang-raping a local stripper/prostitute, the campus administration took the stripper's words over the students' and threw the students to the wolves.</comment>

<comment>Every American school has established departments for majority studies. You just know it by it's traditional name: History.It is the school priority to increase minorities. It is a well established fact that increasing diversity is good for soul of society, but also it's bottom line. GDP can grow by 11% just by increasing diversity.What happened to the Lacrosse team was terrible. But now, the administration over corrected. They have tolerated racial slurs, graffitied use of the n word, and a noose.</comment>

<comment>11%?  REALLY?  Where did you get THAT number?  Why not increase diversity more and get to ELEVENTY percent?</comment>

<comment>35% increase in out performance in companies with racial and gender diversity: http://www.mckinsey.com/insigh...GDP Growth of 11% by including women (11.8Trillion in world GDP): http://www.mckinsey.com/Insigh...http://www.citylab.com/work/20...http://www.osipp.osaka-u.ac.jp...</comment>

<comment>That is not what the McKinsey study reported.  The claim was a 35% probability of outperforming a similar but nondiverse company in the same industry.  A very modest claim indeed and possibly one that will not be sustainable.</comment>

<comment>35% Modest? It's certainly outside the margin of error. Every article above shows an increase in economic growth with more diversity.What also of increasing GDP 11%?</comment>

<comment>Can you list some reasons why diversity would improve performance or GDP?</comment>

<comment>Depends.  Hire more highly qualified Asians or Russians increases GDPIlliterate immigrants won't increase GDPHire more Womyn Studies majors will reduce GDP</comment>

<comment>Absolutely!  Look at what diversity has done for Greece's GDP!  Again, are you just a troll, or a silly person in need of an economics class?</comment>

<comment>"It is a well established fact that increasing diversity is good for soul of society, but also it's bottom line. GDP can grow by 11% just by increasing diversity."  This is a completely fact free assertion.</comment>

<comment>Please look at the four links above.</comment>

<comment>Garbage In Garbage Out</comment>

<comment>And you'll get the results you pay for.  If you're paying for a study that says X, the folks doing the study will do their darndest to provide what you're looking for.</comment>

<comment>Do you know who left it?  Did you read what they wrote?  Or are you just hyperventilating based on some breathless accounts in the Intertubes?</comment>

<comment>Can you really be this foolish?</comment>

<comment>How is even 1000 times as much "help" going to prevent someone from hanging a noose?I think that's one of the weird dividing lines between people -- there are those who believe it's important to raise children to be robust in a world that will, in each new generation, face problems the other group -- utopians who believe the world is perfectable -- thought were extinct.It's like the difference between mitigationists and adaptationists on global warming. Some believe they can and ought to exercise the power they imagine we have, to bring balance to the climate. Others have the humility to believe the climate is not a puppy we can train so easily.The way these protests are jumping from campus to campus is a mark of hysteria, not reasonable reaction to grave problems. Satanic ritual abuse, progressives wringing their hands that evangelicals would launch pogroms because Mel Gibson does a Jesus movie -- all these hysterical reactions.If I were an administrator I'd say that when you're done sobbing uncontrollably and have entered into some long-term counseling to help you deal with life's travails, we'll listen to you in a calm, respectful exchange regarding Woodrow Wilson's legacy. We'll do what we can when reports of criminal acts are actionable. As for any manner of expressive "speech" that you may find offensive, you might wish to publicly shame its purveyors with your own speech. But don't start rehearsing the idea that authority exists to cave in to your demands to punish your enemies.</comment>

<comment>Bravo!</comment>

<comment>Fully agree.  Life's not easy - and it's a lot harder when you're whimpering and expecting the absolute worst to happen to you.To go looking for things to be offended by in order to be protected by some authority doesn't make me think they're ready to handle the real world... far from it.  They're looking for preemptive excuses to explain their failure to cope with the difficulties of getting a degree in something useful.</comment>

<comment>Trivial act, trivial impact.</comment>

<comment>Darned right it's trivial, spanky.  In fact, if you are all bed-wetty about the noose (especially if you haven't bothered to read the letter from the kid who did it) then I would never hire you for anything past serving fries, and even then I'd worry that you'd sue me if some customer got irate because you couldn't get her order right.</comment>

<comment>Trivializing the act is appropriate. It's a trivial act performed by trivial minds. Likely a reaction to power mad pencil necks like yourself, rather than the product of any actual racial animus.</comment>

<comment>What kind of power is exerted exactly?</comment>

<comment>Expressing rage and racism is included in the right to free expression.  It's not illegal to be a jerk, nor should it be.</comment>

<comment>"... it's quite clearly an expression of rage and racism."Or it could be an expression of a drunk idiot, showing off for drunken friends.To assume the absolute worst of every observed action leads one into paranoia.  And that sort of paranoia is self-reinforcing, to the point where you'll assume the worst of everyone based on what you THINK might happen.And isn't that what you're arguing against in the first place?</comment>

<comment>"To say it might be a drunken prank, a dare, or performance art is to trivialize the act. "Yes, that's because the act might have been trivial, as noted.  That's simply true by definition.  You can't assume it necessarily wasn't trivial, then attack those who point out it may have been trivial: that's the entire point."The intent to offend and scare is absolutely clear."No, it's not.  You don't seem to be following the point here, at all.</comment>

<comment>One noose too many. Are you not grateful that the shoes you are wearing do not pinch?</comment>

<comment>But that's the point. If you cannot sleep at night unless no bad thing ever happens on your campus, you need psychiatric help. No campus, or town for that matter, will ever 100% eliminate any offensive behavior. It can't be done consistent with individual freedom.</comment>

<comment>If you cannot sleep knowing that someone somewhere felt her or his complaints about racism were heard, you need moral help.How does it hurt you for people to know this is happening and to try to do something about it?</comment>

<comment>What can you do about this? Cameras on every corner? Race Bias Forensic Investigative Units to conduct handwriting analysis, and of course fingerprinting and DNA sampling the entire campus to isolate the culprit. Ban all hoods and face coverings, certainly - have to be able to ID the suspects. All sales of paint, pens, paper, markers, eggs, string, and dried macaroni will be registered and submitted to a central database.I'm laying on thick to make a point, but seriously. What can you do, other than say to the students "Sorry that happened. We'll try to catch the guy."</comment>

<comment>Black lives matters is literally killing black children by causing a universal distrust of police.  Care to discuss the stats?</comment>

<comment>Since when is breaking into someone's room while they are asleep and writing a death threat on their wall a non-issue?How is displaying a noose in a public area not a big deal to you at all (that is a direct reference to lynchings that have killed thousands of African Americans, Native Americans, Latinx Americans, and Asian Americans)?Your definition of what constitutes a threat is mystifyingly myopic.  Under this paradigm you put forth, it seems as though nothing short of a physical assault counts as a cause for concern.</comment>

<comment>Sticks. And. Stones.</comment>

<comment>So let's do nothing if anyone makes any verbal threat?  I'm sorry, but that is not how the law works.  As someone who opted for this approach that you advocate when I was being stalked as a young teen, I can tell you that it does not work.  Bullying, harassment, etc., when ignored, results in the escalation of a threat.</comment>

<comment>The ONLY proper response to bullies, is to put them down HARD, FAST and ASAP.Anything else just makes them think you're weak and gives them more courage to harrass you.I learned that lesson in my first year of High School, as a sophomore, when a senior who was also a Varsity football player figured that it would be fun to harass, a much (5 years) younger, and thus smaller geek with glasses.To his surprise the half-his-size geek-with-glasses had been a serious student of Karate for 3 years and was preparing for his black belt, did not take kindly being repeatedly slammed backwards into lockers.For the rest of the year, after his suspension was over, the ex-football player had a tendency to cover his crotch as he limped past the geek in the halls between classes.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that IS the way the law works.  Unless someone is threatening you with a direct statement of specific intended action, the only threat is in your mind.  The problem with terms like "bullying" and "harassment" is that they've been coopted by the professional victimhood mongers to the point where it simply means "you said or did something I don't like". So, no, you have no right not to be offended.  Get a life.</comment>

<comment>If someone breaks into a room, they should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  If someone uses rope for a mysterious reason known only to them, and you assume it signifies racism, you're crazy and should be admitted to a psych ward.</comment>

<comment>You act as though the noose has no connection to lynchings in American history, and that is wrong.  Why do you think Billie Holiday's famous anti-lynching song, "Strange Fruit", references hanging bodies from a tree?  Nooses are heavily symbolic of lynchings in American history especially.  If nooses are not associated at least symbolically with lynchings in the USA, then how come the Wikipedia page for "Lynching" has the word "noose" featured in it's "See also" section (as seen here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...It is one thing to say that more evidence is needed to confirm something, but it's another thing to deny that the noose has any relation to lynching, especially in the USA.-----------------------------------Articles which illustrate my point:http://www.tandfonline.com/doi...http://www.latimes.com/opinion...http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/pa...http://www.npr.org/templates/s...-----------------------------------Documented lynching photos which feature the widespread use of nooses (warning:  very disturbing content, dead bodies):https://upload.wikimedia.org/w...https://upload.wikimedia.org/w...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Oh please...Do you actually read the stupid things your write ??If you hang something or someone, a noose will be involved.So to bloviate nonsense like:"..Documented lynching photos which feature the widespread use of nooses.."has go to be the most blatant exercise of beating a dead horse.By the way, I use a noose to hang hams, bacon and briskets in my smoker..Since I first started smoking meats with my grandfather as a young boy, I have "lynched" all sorts of things other than "strange fruit" in decades past.And yet, even with the ignorant emotion-laden bloviations of such as you. the closest I come is when I'm roughing it in the wild and setting snares for wild rabbit.People like you make me think of looky-loos who slow down at car accidents in the perverse hopes of seeing blood and gore.Get over it..</comment>

<comment>You are misinterpreting my argument entirely so let me spell it out for you:  for many people, the public hanging of a noose in a public space can be unsettling to say the least due to its historic connotation with lynching.  If people chose to complain about this, they are exercising their First Amendment right to do so.  You are also entitled to disagree with them and me on this.  My position is that, in light of the history behind the imagery of a hanging noose in a public space, I can understand why students would react strongly and feel less safe in that environment, especially since no one really learned of the motive until at least a month afterward.  I also believe that students are allowed to protest if they feel that they are not having their needs met by the school that they are paying to go to.That is what I am saying.</comment>

<comment>The basic "need" of students at school is a simple one.An good education..Anything else is secondary, although nowadays that seems to be reversed, and the education seems missingThe problem with your explanation fails the Occam's razor test.You're looking for deep symbolism from a stupid prank to fit your ideological agenda.</comment>

<comment>You are misinterpreting me.  I am not saying that the person who put up the noose did it to incite a lynching.  All that I am saying is that it is certainly understandable that many students would be offended and feel threatened by a symbol that is historically associated with lynching.  It's called having empathy.Also, a school is SUPPOSED to keep students safe.  How can students at any school learn if they are in an unsafe environment?</comment>

<comment>If you truly believe this, then surely you must attach a higher significance to the Democrats, who were actually, not figuratively, hanging blacks at the time.  When you and others of your ilk launch your campaign to eradicate the Democratic party for their ties to Jim Crow and the klan, I'll begin to believe your silly fervor.  Since that has never come up, I must assume you're simply milking this issue for attention.</comment>

<comment>This is just more race-baiting after the fact.It's ironic that the lynchers were in fact Democrats who also managed to lynch a few Republicans along the way.http://www.wnd.com/2007/10/441..."The original targets of the Ku Klux Klan were Republicans, both black and white, according to a new television program and book, which describe how the Democrats started the KKK and for decades harassed the GOP with lynchings and threats.An estimated 3,446 blacks and 1,297 whites died at the end of KKK ropes from 1882 to 1964.The documentation has been assembled by David Barton ofWallbuilders and published in his book “Setting the Record Straight: American History in Black & White,” which reveals that not only did the Democrats work hand-in-glove with the Ku Klux Klan for generations, they started the KKK and endorsed its mayhem."</comment>

<comment>Both parties have a lot to answer for, but to say that Republican Party has never had any connection to the KKK is not true:   http://www.psmag.com/books-and....Again, this is why becoming affiliated with a particular party is not ideal.It's hard for any major political party in the United States to have its hands clean when American history (as is also the case with virtually every other country out there) is a bloody one rife with exploitation and abuse.</comment>

<comment>It's always amazing how people will build fictions to fit their narrative..The Republicans contrary to the SIXBIRB narrative of the left NEVER forgot their anti-slavery roots.Particularly in the South, where they have fought and died for Civil Rights..Look up who those +1000 white victims of lyichings were.You're just trying to spread the shit to try diminishing Democrat guilt of 100+ years of racism that hasn't stopped today.Here are some recent examapleshttp://townhall.com/columnists...Maybe it's time you fools stopped drinking your own Koo-Aid.</comment>

<comment>If you think I blindly support the Democratic Party, then I direct you to other posts I made earlier.  I mentioned the my objections to Democratic politicians like Jackson, FDR, and even Clinton.   Just pointing out that Republican views shifted since the Civil Rights Movement and showing that the Republican Party spread in the South during the later 20th Century in part due to Klan popularity is not constructing a false narrative.  It's simply stating a fact that both political parties have a lot to own up to. </comment>

<comment>The lie is in the line".. Republican views shifted since the Civil Rights Movement.."They didn'tVOTERS shifted to the Republican line in the South starting in the 1950s.That is a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT thing...The lie you spout is just that.A lie and not a fact, even though you need to believe it.</comment>

<comment>Pure fiction, huh?  Apparently, you don't know much about the Southern Strategy.http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/ar...http://www.nytimes.com/package...</comment>

<comment>IndeedYou're a gullible fool for believing it too. OhAnd since I've looked into it a tad deeper than you have, I know more about than any superficial web surfer like you,</comment>

<comment>Just because you can tell that I am liberal does not mean that I swear allegiance to any specific political party.  You are making a false comparison.  I am not saying that a noose always signifies lynching and cannot ever be interpreted in any other way, but it is hard to deny the history behind the image and why it could bring about some very legitimate concerns among a student body.I think the Democratic Party should acknowledge its myriad skeletons in their closet with regard to racism, internment camps, and helping establish mass incarceration we see today more than they do, as should the Republican Party for their own misdeeds.  However, that is not the issue at hand.  Just because you personally do not associate the hanging of a noose in a public space in any strongly negative way does not mean that other students have no reason to be concerned.  They actually go to that campus and have a right to feel safe there.</comment>

<comment>What makes you think that I do blindly trust the Democratic Party?  Andrew Jackson was responsible for The Trail of Tears.  FDR's administration resulted in the mass internment of Japanese-Americans and other Asian Americans during the Second World War.  Both Republicans and Democrats alike helped build the modern day mass incarceration problem we see right now.  Just because I am liberal does not mean I automatically think highly of the Democratic Party simply because its CURRENT form appeals to my politics more than the CURRENT form of the Republican Party.</comment>

<comment>The person broke into the dorm, not his room. And, does it occur to you that if that person was actually dangerous and not cowardly that graffiti wouldn't have been his chosen weapon? Likewise, a noose. Cowardly acts.</comment>

<comment>That is still very serious.  Breaking into someone's living space in any way is a severe breach of trust and privacy.  A campus SHOULD care if students are breaking into and defacing private spaces on campus.</comment>

<comment>You're quite hysterical and paranoid. There haven't been lynchings in over a half century. The "noose" was a broken cable you dummy. And over the years many claims of racism and vandalism turned out to be leftwing kooks committing the acts themselves; mentally ill individuals. The real threat is black on black crime but that's probably uncomfortable for you to address.</comment>

<comment>Since you'd rather resort to ad hominem rhetoric than anything actually constructive, I was considering not responding to you, but when you said that there have not been lynchings for "over a half century", I had to reply.That could not be further from the truth.  The lynching of Michael Donald occurred on March 21, 1981.  The lynching of James Byrd, Jr. at the hands of multiple white supremacists took place in 1998.Just because you are misinformed on these and other events does not mean that they are absent from modern history.Can you cite any number of these serious incidents that you maintain appeared racist only to be the work of someone mentally ill?Also, MOST crime is intraracial (happens within one's own racial community) (source:  https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publ....</comment>

<comment>Just because you fantasize that a threat exists does not mean that in fact there was a threat.Others can NOT be held responsible for your fantasies.On Halloween, there are a whole bunch of "skeletons' hanging around with nooses around their necksAccording to you, this is all about lynchings and is a threat to blacks.POPPYCOCK...</comment>

<comment>Let me clarify, if students do not feel safe by something on campus (which is what happened here at Duke) and decide to protest/make complaints about it, they are exercising their legal right to do so as protected by the First Amendment.You may disagree with what they say, but it does not make them wrong for protesting.They did not know about the cause/motivation behind this incident until at least a month later either.  Also, just because a symbol is not offensive to you does not mean it cannot be offensive to anyone.  The student who put up that noose later apologized for their insensitivity even if they maintain they did not mean to convey such a message.  You can screw up without intending to.  That does not make it not an issue.Also, a noose as part of a Halloween costume has an entirely different historical context behind it than a noose hanging from a tree.</comment>

<comment>And so they must be expelled.</comment>

<comment>The noose turned out to have been placed there by a foreign student who didn't realize the cultural implications of his act. It wasn't a racist gesture. https://today.duke.edu/2015/05...</comment>

<comment>At one school what were believed to be nooses were frames for lanterns. Every rope in a tree is not a noose unless you are looking for nooses.</comment>

<comment>The noose left by an undergrad who has since apologized that he did something stupid and thoughtless?  THIS keeps Duke students awake cowering in their beds?  Please.</comment>

<comment>The most micro of micro-aggressions. I hope the undergrad micro-apologized.</comment>

<comment>The noose incident was investigated.  It was hung by a foreign student who didn't understand the racial significance.  He thought it was a funny way of asking his friends to hang out.  That's why he is still on campus.</comment>

<comment>a negro student hung it as a prank.</comment>

<comment>What acts? We're dealing with hoaxes and urban legends.</comment>

<comment>These are just the acts reported in the article.if you had a list of all the acts, all the time someone used the N word on these students, or yelled something else racist, or made a threat, you'd say, why are they complaining so much?  If you only go by this list, you're thinking, why is the list so short?Damned if they do, damned if they don't.</comment>

<comment>Are there examples of someone actually being found guilty of such a hate crime and being let off the hook by the administration?  Because anything other than that and you're just demanding a witch hunt.  Toughen up, buttercup.</comment>

<comment>Sertorius: These are the same people who want to simply invite people into our country with inadequate screening.</comment>

<comment>This article mixes up speech that someone finds offensive and behavior that is threatening. Offensive does not equal threatening.Freedom of speech includes speech we as an individual might find offensive - that is the nature of public spaces. Feelings about others, about their speech, do not determine safety; behavior does.This article reports little in the way of behavioral threats but lots of "feelings about" what others say, write or who they are or are not, which the author, the students and administration seem to want to censor and even criminalize. Feelings need a reality check whether there are actual threats to individual or public safety.</comment>

<comment>Hanging a noose on somebody's door is a clear & unambiguous threat.And not protected free speech.</comment>

<comment>It's not protected speech, but it almost certainly was put up by an infantile juvenile delinquent (whatever their actual biological age).Many college students are for the most part still the equivalent of little children in terms of their maturity, awareness and perspective. That means campuses will tend to have a surreal mix of intellectuals and academic professionals on the one hand and lots of spoiled, self-absorbed jackasses with serious entitlement issues on the other.These days, the typical adolescent angst-ridden teeny-bopper nihilism stage can last well into one's 20's. Which is kind of scary.</comment>

<comment>The perceived intentions of an aggressor vary greatly based on one's perspective. An infantile juvenile delinquent may be non-threatening to those not threatened, but the object of the threat will likely have a different perspective.In the end, a clear threat is a clear threat, regardless of the immaturity or hidden intentions of the aggressor. Maybe they were raised in an environment where everyone knew when they were joking. But they're in the real world now, and there should be real consequences.</comment>

<comment>Sure, there should be real consequences for vandalism and explicit threats of violence. But there should also be a measured response to such threats, especially when they are merely implied; probability would suggest that a noose hung on the door of a college student in the midst of a lot of heated, racially-charged controversy on campus was put there by some sheltered undergrad idiot fresh out of the 'burbs who still thinks shocking the grownups is amusing.In many other contexts such a gesture could (and should) be taken as a much more explicit threat and dealt with accordingly.</comment>

<comment>So even though he is legally an adult and going to school away from home, we should still treat him as a child. He is clearly old enough to understand the historical context. If we want him to grow up, treat him like a grown up. Otherwise, we'll be making excuses for his entire life.</comment>

<comment>I never stated anything of the sort. I was just pointing out a likely source of such behavior.And I've found that you can't assume that someone has a good grasp of... well, anything simply because they are a certain age.Even though most of us can't imagine harboring such arrogantly-dense, willful ignorance it doesn't mean that a lot of people aren't doing just that.</comment>

<comment>In their context, it may very well be amusing. But they are operating in the real world, not in the world inside their head. And it's their responsibility to consider what others think of their actions, and not just do what they find amusing.</comment>

<comment>The world inside our heads IS the "real" world. But that doesn't mean that our world won't get rocked when it messes with someone else's equally-real world.In any case, you must not have much experience dealing with angst-ridden, nihilist teeny-boppers with severe entitlement issues. What they find amusing is the only thing that matters (to them, because they are only thing that matters in the entire Universe).Well, it does until their self-absorbed world gets schooled by someone else's, that is. Typically this type of "schooling" happens to us somewhere between the ages of 14-18, but in recent decades it seems to be shifting (anthropogenic social-climate change?) later and later, with more and more post-adolescent juveniles acting like spoiled brats well into their 20's.We are probably heading into an economic Golden Age for Psychiatrists, Psychologists, assorted therapists, and "socialization consultants" (which I just made up, but it sounds like a feasible business model to me).</comment>

<comment>Ha, fair point. I think a reasonable argument could be made that the shift you're talking about has been happening for far longer than a few decades, and before was much younger than 14-18. And I love the idea of socialization consultants. You could probably offer those services to pet owners as well.However, back to the point: yes, there's no doubt that many people don't consider the broader implications or consequences of their actions. I think it's safe to generalize and say that most people who commit crimes aren't thinking about any possible punishment: they are thinking about what's in front of them right now. In this case, a clear threat was made in a charged environment. Sure, you can chalk it up to "kids being kids" but at what point do you stop? Moreover, what message does this send to the people being threatened?</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure it is a threat so much as a taunt.When was the last time someone was actually lynched?  (its been a while).However, it is a very effective taunt to someone who is racially sensitive.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Well, if there was never any likelihood of following through with it, yes.It is just a reference to a very dark time for black people in order to bring up those feelings.  Like I said, it is much more a taunt than a threat.It is IRL trolling.</comment>

<comment>Even if one were to see it like that, it is below the belt. The bout/match should be awarded to the aggrieved with the offender thrown out of the ring.</comment>

<comment>I agree that it is dark and not a great thing to do.However to think that it is a threat is to exaggerate.A threat is directly proportional to the ability to follow through with said threat.If I told you I was going to cut you in half with my lazer beam eyes, that would be a non-threatening threat.On campuses where being implicated in black face leads to huge protests, I find it highly unlikely that the campus would accept a lynching.As such, those threats seem toothless, and as such, non threatening to a rational observer.</comment>

<comment>I once got a court case dismissed in which I was involved in a barfight because I got the man I had a disagreement with to state in front of witnesses (and in turn in the police officer's report) that he had, in fact stated "fighting words" right before I sucker punched him.A hell of a lot of people these days don't understand the way the legal system actually functions, case in point being this Matt character. You are in the right, as far as I follow your argument.</comment>

<comment>You're kind of a jerk, aren't you?</comment>

<comment>He had been discourteous towards a female friend of mine, and had ignored my polite suggestions to cease</comment>

<comment>Oh, he was rude?  Clearly if he was impolite you're at liberty to assault him and then manipulate the legal system to get yourself out of the consequences of your behavior.  Hey, is that always ok?  I mean, if I happen to think that these college jerks are being rude (you know by invading libraries and preventing students from studying to further their idiotic agenda), is it cool with you if people punch them?  You know, as long as they say something like, "Hey, they really scared me by saying fighty things!"  How far does that go in your mind?  Is it cool to shoot them?  Or push them down a flight of stairs?  As long as they are scary and all?</comment>

<comment>I was taught certain things from my parents about what is acceptable and what is not. and this man fell into the not category as clearly as night is from day. prior to my hitting him, i gave him the option of disengaging without violence, but he didn't take it. So i made sure that when I brought violence upon him, that it was completely avoidable. I shall never feel bad about such a choice as this was. This man said something beyond the pale, and he learned such a thing at the edge of my fist. Even a fool learns something once it hits them.</comment>

<comment>So, you're saying your parents taught you to hit people when they say things that make you unhappy?  How did you make it through kindergarten?  To me, this is the heart of the issue.  Every abuser who has ever lived uses the "they deserved it" defense.  It's wrong to hit people unless you are defending yourself from being hit.  That's the essence of the law you brutally used to save yourself.  Because in the US we believe in the law applying equally to all, you've essentially said that anyone can hit anyone who they feel "goes beyond the pale".  Incidentally, I've personally helped put a man in jail who hit his wife because she went "beyond the pale", she didn't get dinner on the table before he got home.  This entire movement would end in short order if people get to do violence whenever they feel someone goes "beyond the pale".  The polls suggest to me that quite a few people now are fantasizing about punching these pinheads in the face because most of us feel they are evil bullies.  I'm lumping you into that group.  You feel you have the right to do violence whenever you want, and that you should be free from the consequences you would logically expect to be given to anyone who behaves exactly the way you do.  I'm sorry you feel no shame, pretty sure your parents would be embarrassed by you.</comment>

<comment>There are times and places where violence is necessary and they are very few and very far between. It's a bunch of liberal BS that violence should only be used in the immediate service of self defense.I spoke in understatement before, which perhaps did not make things clear. I didn't just decide to punch this guy on a whim. He made unwanted advances towards my friend , when he persisted despite her attempts to decline, I gave him a more pointed imperative to walk away. At which point he said something along the line about how 'this is a free country, and Ican talk to any c*nts that I wants to.[sic]' Along with other things of about equal crudeness, like calling my friend a dolloped up dike and myself a f*g. At this point, I should have gotten the bartender, but instead I decided this guy deserved a lesson in manners and amateur dentistry.So I stood up, let him see all six foot five of me and asked if we had a problem we could work out. And he got right up close and poked me in the chest and said something like the only problem I had was being a fag*it about to get my ass kicked. I asked him if those were fighting words, and he said damn straight those were fighting words. Then I hit him as hard as I could. Notice he initiated contact, and he spoke what he considered to be fighting words, even if he probably didn't know the textbook definition of those words. At this point, I was completely within my legal rights to defend myself with extreme prejudice.Violence wasn't the first choice, but it will always be a choice, especially in the defense of others. I will never apologize for this attitude.To conflate my use of violence with just "do I hit people who upset me" is frankly a bunch of bullsh*t. And if you think it possible for a world in which violence is never necessary  to exist, you are frankly naïve about the demons of human nature.</comment>

<comment>WOW, WAY TO STIGMATIZE THE MENTALLY ILL!</comment>

<comment>Duke is below the Mason-Dixon and "a very dark time for black people" is now, ongoing, with lynching a part of the lives of many people who are still around. You feel like threatening behavior is substantiated if it takes place in an intellectual setting? This is the equivalent of a bomb threat. It is not "symbolic" or "taunting" behavior if the object itself could incur actual death.</comment>

<comment>I grew up in a black neighborhood in atlanta.  It was not good, but it was a far cry from the days of lynchings.The college I went to had multiple bomb threats during every finals.  They were never announced, because they were fake.  That is the rational response to fake threats.</comment>

<comment>"It was not good, but it was a far cry from the days of lynchings."You're satisfied with that, huh?</comment>

<comment>I am not.I am horrified by the fact that the white kids who grew up in the same crappy neighborhoods did not have the same tools to escape.I was horrified by the fact that rich black kids from good white areas went to college instead of the people I lived among that affirmative action was designed for.I was horrified by how bad it was for everyone there and how the left thinks we should pretend to fix these areas by instituting race based affirmative action (that helps rich blacks in white areas), instead of helping people from areas lacking in opportunity.I want to fix the right problem, not pretend to fix a problem because it is politically expedient and checks the right racial boxes.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans Southern strategy won them the South.The Democrats White Trash strategy will lose them the middle of the country.If you're white, don't have an advanced degree, and don't live on one of the coasts, you're (privileged) white trash and your problems don't matter.</comment>

<comment>Not sure what part of that (not unfounded) political anger prevents you from being a racial ally.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  I have a problem with "race is the only problem" people because their attitude is self defeating.If you think racism is so powerful that you will never get ahead, it kills ambition.  That is a big problem in the community i grew up in.</comment>

<comment>Trolling is hateful.</comment>

<comment>It was hung on a tree, not a door. That's a considerable difference. While still threatening, it's meant more to offend, rather than threaten any particular individual unambiguously.</comment>

<comment>https://www.washingtonpost.com...This isn't simple hyperbole and given how these investigations tend to be handled...http://www.thedailybeast.com/a...its unreasonable to assume its a taunt </comment>

<comment>That looks pretty crappy.I would have to point out the following:1) A white trailer park is about as far away from liberal college campuses as you can get.2) This could be suicide but regardless should be properly investigated for signs of foul play.</comment>

<comment>1) Its actually only 2 hours away from Duke, and the point is you'reasking students to take on faith that a noose on a tree isn't a credible threat in a state in which more than 100 lynchings occurred.http://www.eji.org/files/EJI%2...2) the circumstances of this particular case are dubious at best, but the point of these protest is to bring public attention to this type of behavior. Behavior that these students are asked to endure that their peers don't have to</comment>

<comment>1)  100 lynchings over how long of a time frame?  How many lynchings have occurred in the last 20 years?  Compared to the number of guns / alcohol related deaths, how does that number stand.Sounds to me, like they should be afraid of alcohol and guns, not lynchings.  This is again what would be noted as an unreasonable fear.  This is akin to being afraid of flying when driving is much bigger due to the unusual nature of the risk, not the actual level of risk.2) Every group has problems that only they have to pay attention to.</comment>

<comment>I've given you the information to see for yourself, and I've given you leads into suspected lynchings in the last year alone. If it was unreasonable for a person to fear being lynched no one would hang nooses from trees to taunt or threaten people. Noting more frequent causes of death doesn't negate other causes, it only points out the weighted burden marginalized groups must endure. Every group has the right to advocate for issues that disproportionately effect them, which is the point of the unrest. If you don't care just say you don't care but stop trying to discredit people who are only asking that they not be harassed while they go to school.  But then again maybe empathy is a problem you should pay attention to.</comment>

<comment>HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.Do you honestly believe this?They are not asking for this.  They are advocating that other view points do not have the right to exist.They have been caught on video harassing people.If they are trying to stop harassment, they are working against themselves.</comment>

<comment>Because they might be brazen and hate-filled enough to stand in public and tie a noose around a tree branch or scrawl death threats on a wall. But they would NEVER be brazen and hate-filled enough to escalate to throwing a firebomb in the student's window, or physically attacking them when they come home after studying at night.</comment>

<comment>You do realize the difference between taunting someone and assaulting them.Or don't you.I'm not sure anymore.Trolling someone is vastly different than imposing upon them physical harm.Hanging nooses on campuses, is trolling everyone on campus.The more you overreact, the more you empower those trolls and encourage this behavior.Stop encouraging nooses by overreacting.</comment>

<comment>Anonymous posts on a message board or bathroom stall are cowardly, risk-free activities.  If you are committed enough to do it in public view, that's a significant step up.  Making a noose is not something you do idly.  It means somebody put some thought into this activity.  They found rope.  They made a noose, knowing what a powerful symbol this was. They carried it out to a tree in public.  All of this knowing that if they were caught, in a rational society, they would likely be expelled or at the very least shunned.</comment>

<comment>Don't you know? Firebombing happens every day on elite campuses... and the administrators encourage these attacks.</comment>

<comment>Arguably, some of the violence that has been visited upon black americans by generally white police officers could be considered a form of lynching. Sure, it isn't Mississippi Burning style lynching, but it is unaccountable violence.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but then white people are also lynched, just to a smaller rate.Cop violence disproportionately, affects black communities.It is racist to however think it ONLY affects black communities.</comment>

<comment>Black people get lynched almost every week in America.</comment>

<comment>?????</comment>

<comment>Lynching is when a racist kills a black person, and justice is never seen. It happens all the damn time.</comment>

<comment>The noose was not hung on a door, but on a tree.Unless that tree is tied to some specific person, that makes it protected speech.</comment>

<comment>So what's the remedy? Mao-style re-education camps?</comment>

<comment>How funny!How witty!Or, at least half-way</comment>

<comment>That as may be, but there was no noose on a door, it was hung from a tree outside.Also, hanging a noose from someone's door is a dick move, but an argument that it's protected free speech could be made.</comment>

<comment>Wasn't on a door.  Was in a tree.  Apologized for by a doofus undergrad.</comment>

<comment>It's likely not a threat at all. Democrats sometimes feel it is because that's how they used to threaten folks before they had to go underground.</comment>

<comment>I thought it was on a tree?</comment>

<comment>This is not correct.  See above.  The noose was a joke from a foreign exchange student.  Thus, protected.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that is the reason we have free speech.The Catholic church for example thought martin luther was an asshat.I'm pretty sure racists felt the same way about MLK.Free speech is about giving anyone the right to speak their mind because otherwise they will be unable to convince you that you and not they are being an asshat.</comment>

Don't be sexist when fighting sexism.Can I hate both the activists spitting on people and the racist people they are mad at (but not complaining to)?Can I hate misogynists and misandrists whether they claim they are MRA or feminist?Can I hate racists in the racial equality movement or inside the KKK movement?</comment>

<comment>I don't care what your motivation is.The path to hell is paved in good intentions.Bad behavior is not excusable because you agree with the cause ostensibly supported by those engaging in bad behavior.Supporting your side when they engage in bad behavior is corrosive and works against the cause you osensibly support in the long run.If you want to fight racism, don't coddle racists in the anti-racism movement.If you want to fight sexism, don't coddle sexist feminists / mras.Otherwise you make it harder and harder for advocacy to succeed by engaging in the behaviors that the activists are ostensibly attempting to fix.</comment>

<comment>That is NOT  the point he was trying to get across!!!!! He was saying that fighting fire with fire burns even worse, in more eloquent and accurate terms. You should always stand up for yourself, but trying to fight hateful speech by saying hateful speech of the same ilk will never work.Look, i hate those reverse-racism decriers who legitimately think that being white is a bad thing based off the racial backlash of minorities to white-dominant culture. But it DOES demonstrate how fighting racism with reverse hatred leads to more hate, as evidenced by white people disenfranchised by the acknowledgement of society's bias towards white people, no matter how misguided it is.</comment>

<comment><quote>Everyone has a right to say (almost) whatever they want, but society has the right, even the obligation, to tell that person he is, in fact, an idiot.</quote>I would agree that people have the right, and maybe a moral obligation, to criticize the generator of hate speech.  But above you went further than that.  You said the generator of hate speech was guilty of assault, and therefore implied that the perpetrator be punished by the state. Perhaps you would agree that the student (if it was a student) who hung the noose should be expelled.  Since Duke is a private school, it is not legally bound by the First Amendment and could expel such a student.Those sanctions are more than criticism.  Unfortunately, in my view, a disturbingly high percentage of college age and below Americans favor such sanctions.They assume, of course, that it will be they who decide what expression is allowed instead of say, Donald Trump or Ben Carson.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. But who gets to define hate speech?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I think you're talking about Virginia v. Black. It doesn't define "hate speech," though. The holding was that cross burning was not protected speech if the prosecution can show (based on the context) that it was done with intent to intimidate.Hate speech is not a 1st Amendment exception. But depending on the context, a given instance of hate speech can fall into an exception.</comment>

<comment>this is by far the best comment I've read in about 7 years!! Bravo!</comment>

<comment>I think they knew they were being d*cks.  I knew quite a few people in college that made a point of being d*cks on a regular basis, and I went to a school full of geeks.  I can't imagine what a school with fraternities would be like.  But I think it might be useful for someone to look at how many actual assaults against minorities are happening at Duke.</comment>

<comment>Define "assault" ... an improper facial expression can be interpreted as assault</comment>

<comment>One problem is that the allegation of "hate speech" is easily weaponized by people who merely wish to suppress points of view they don't like.There's a difference between telling someone they're an idiot for how they use their right to speak freely, and asserting that the idiots don't, in fact, have that right. They do. The right exists precisely because allegations of asshattery would otherwise permit weaponization of victimhood.</comment>

<comment>It is also about protecting citizens from eachother when they speak their mind.Just because you advocate for an idea that i dislike does not give me license to physically assault you.That is also the first amendment.</comment>

<comment>Defending a speech and defending a right to the speech are two different things. The issue with censorship advocates is that they frequently, sometime deliberately, conflate the two. You can criticize speech and yet still believe in its right to be said and heard.</comment>

<comment>No, threats of violence are not covered under free speech.  And I have no idea what you're getting at with your second remark.  It sounds like you really do want upsetting or offensive speech to be outlawed.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>This is a good point. Just because speech is legal, that doesn't mean it's illegitimate to feel threatened or unwelcome in response to it. But it does affect what remedies are available, and expectations of how authorities ought to respond must be adjusted accordingly.</comment>

<comment>Actually threats of violence ARE protected under free speech as long as they are not 'true' threats were 'true' threat is completely un-defined by the Supreme Court.Example: "In NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., white merchants in Claiborne County, Mississippi, sued the NAACP to recover losses caused by a boycott by black citizens of their businesses, and to enjoin future boycott activity.985 During the course of the boycott, NAACP Field Secretary Charles Evers had told an audience of “black people that any ‘uncle toms’ who broke the boycott would ‘have their necks broken’ by their own people.”986 The Court acknowledged that this language “might have been understood as inviting an unlawful form of discipline or, at least, as intending to create a fear of violence ....”987 Yet, no violence had followed directly from Evers’ speeches, and the Court found that Evers’ “emotionally charged rhetoric . . . did not transcend the bounds of protected speech set forth in Brandenburg… An advocate must be free to stimulate his audience with spontaneous and emotional appeals for unity and action in a common cause. When such appeals do not incite lawless action, they must be regarded as protected speech.”988 While holding that, under Bradenburg, Evers’ speech did not constitute unprotected incitement of lawless action,989 the Court also cited Watts, thereby implying that Evers’ speech also did not constitute a “true threat.”990"http://law.justia.com/constitu...</comment>

<comment>This is dangerous stupidity.</comment>

<comment>Conflation of saying mean things with actual violence is a problem.</comment>

<comment>indeed!  correct is the notion of offence being a sure privilege/right in any "public space." no-one fails to understand as much--where else would offence be sanctioned?  the problem many students feel is that they enjoy little but "public space" in most campus settings.  and they and administrators struggle with the fact.  the greek system is seen as severely strained in efforts to maintain any alternatives to "public space."  do not expect persons to thrive if all they have is always "public space," where offenses are flouted/defended eight days a week.  of course, the need for "public space" is evident.  but compared to what?  nothing? nowhere?  some rejoinders have been better than some others, etc.  histrionics do/can obscure real problems that can be solved.</comment>

<comment>Man, I hope you weren't alive during the 60's:“I tell sincere white people, 'Work in conjunction with us- each of us working among our own kind.'

<comment>Lol You guys are still talking about the Mizzou incident? You realize the media was invited back the next day, right? And that the student photographer thought the whole situation was overblown and a distraction form the real issue, i.e. institutional racism?I wish conservatives expressed as much concern for protestors being shot by white supremacists, or presidential frontrunners proposing to shut down mosques, or crazed misogynists shooting up health clinics. Apparently the Constitution doesn't cover black people, Muslims, or women anymore. There is fascism afoot, but it certainly isn't on the left.</comment>

<comment>"...Apparently the Constitution doesn't cover ...Muslims...".I am very concerned that the Constitution is not protecting Muslims who are threatening any infidel with death who offends Islam.</comment>

<comment>Are you equally concerned with gun-toting thugs intimidating innocent Muslims and publishing their names and addresses on the Internet?http://irvingblog.dallasnews.c...Let me sum up the right's worldview:Fascism = one college photographer being temporarily denied access to a storyNot fascism = staging armed protests outside of mosques that have no connections with terrorism and posting its members' personal information online in an effort to scare them.</comment>

<comment>Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris went into hiding and gave up her identity on the advice of the FBI due to death threats from Muslims. That was five years ago, and she is still in hiding.Can you point to any American Muslims who went into hiding and gave up their identities on the advice of the FBI due to death threats from non-Muslims?</comment>

<comment>Ah, tu quoque. The last refuge of an intellectual coward.I can point to Muslims who were shot in North Carolina because of their religious beliefs. And vandalism, death threats, and assaults directed towards mosques and their members. But it's okay, because Muslims are the demons of the moment, so any crimes committed against them (or anyone who looks like them) can be excused and explained away.</comment>

<comment>The fact that you had to stretch for the North Carolina incident proves you got NOTHING.Even the progressive LA Times had this headline:Motive unsettled in slayings of Muslim students in North Carolinahttp://www.latimes.com/nation/...In fact, it was a lunatic neighbor raging about van parking that set off the rampage.</comment>

<comment>How about beating up Sikhs because they "look" Muslim?http://www.nydailynews.com/new...https://www.washingtonpost.com...How about stabbing a Muslim cabbie?http://www.reuters.com/article...How about beating up a Muslim businesswoman?http://nypost.com/2007/09/16/m...</comment>

<comment>I love the trouble you are having finding legitimate Muslim-bashing incidents in the USA.You might have a lot better luck compiling, for example, Jew-bashing incidents by Muslims in Europe.</comment>

<comment>So beating up Muslims (or people who look Muslim) doesn't qualify as "Muslim-bashing"?</comment>

<comment>You could not even find actual Muslims being beat up- you fail.</comment>

<comment>Except that Muslim businesswoman. And the Muslim cabbie who was stabbed. Those don't count though, for some reason.</comment>

<comment>No.  More like Yale, Princeton, Smith, Claremont McKenna as examples that come to mind immediately.</comment>

<comment>Was the First Amendment trampled on at those schools as well? Have conservatives been purged yet?</comment>

<comment>Google them.  You'll find the stories.  At Yale the demands to fire faculty members who posted a reasonable essay about Halloween costumes were not acceeded to.  Smith students held a sit in and refused admittance to any press who didn't agree ahead of time to support their goals.  First Amendment doesn't apply to these private universities but most of them espouse freedom of speech as a value.</comment>

<comment>Demanding that faculty members be fired is protected speech under the First Amendment. On the other hand, I see no provisions in the Constitution protecting one from criticism or censure. As for the students at Smith: so what? It's not as though they were forcing the press to attend against their will. And it didn't seem as though they were particularly worried about it one way or another.</comment>

<comment>All I was doing was saying the epidemic of controlling speech through intimidation on college campuses because such speech violates the students' sense of "safe space" is not limited to University of Missouri.The students' advocacy that someone lose his/her job itself is not a violation of First Amendment rights, just as those of us who criticize the students are not violating it either.  A state school who does fire an employee for an opinion expressed may well break the law and might be sued by the fired employee.If Smith College were a state school, it could be sued for barring the press from covering a public meeting in the way it did.  Did the press members care?  I don't know, it was a small story. Maybe nobody cares what happens at Smith. I would hope the press there would care for the principle of the thing.</comment>

<comment>The college students are being mocked because things aren't like they were in the 60's, yet they want to pretend they are. Black students aren't being blocked from attending colleges by white governors. Rampant segregation and Jim Crow aren't the norm. Racists aren't openly employed and teaching in major universities. They are facing the occasional slur by individual idiots on campus. That's what is leading to the hyperventilation by the students. It's ridiculous and should be pointed out as such.</comment>

<comment>Bettenguy in 1963: "What are you complaining about? So what if you can't eat at the same lunch counter? It's not like you're enslaved or anything."And it's gone beyond mockery. Conservatives are soiling themselves over these situations. It seems like many of you really think that a student photographer being inconvenienced has put America on the road to death camps. Meanwhile, the right responds to actual violations of free speech with the equivalent of this: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</comment>

<comment>Where, exactly, in my post did I condone actual discrimination? I guess when you can't make an actual cogent argument against my point, a strawman will have to do.Can you point out what free speech violations conservatives supported, or are you making that up as you go too?</comment>

<comment>You're downplaying the concerns of today's protestors by comparing their situation to Jim Crow. I'm merely following your argument to its logical conclusion and demonstrating that similar things could have been said to civil rights workers in the 1950 and 1960s.How about armed thugs demonstrating outside of mosques and publishing its members' personal information online? How about the conservative media's silence in regards to the Minneapolis shooting? How about presidential frontrunners advocating discriminatory policies towards Muslims? How about anti-abortion rhetoric that inspires violence against health clinics?</comment>

<comment>I am downplaying the demands of current protesters because they are trivial and can't be stopped in a free society. They aren't facing institutional and governmental sponsored discrimination like they were in the 60's, which is the point.  I already said that I am just fine with actual threats to person or property being investigated and those responsible being held accountable. What we can't do is make their world safe from private comments that they find offensive. Nor should we try.I am not sure what your other examples are about. Are they supposed to be examples of free speech violations?</comment>

<comment>You know, I keep forgetting that white dudes have veto power over how minorities should think and feel. Their personal experiences count for nothing when compared to the vast expertise on race relations that armchair analysts like yourself possess.I would think intimidating citizens trying to exercise their right to worship qualifies as a violation of their First Amendment rights. Far more so than temporarily denying a photographer access to a story.</comment>

<comment>No. The slurs should stop, ideally. At least steps should be taken towards trying to stop them.</comment>

<comment>Please give a reliable source for that claim.</comment>

<comment>Here is a local KOMU-TV reporter verifying that the groups have separated based on race.  Note he makes no claim as to whether any group was asked to separate."@oliverdarcy Ok. Just spoke with some people around the area. White allies are upstairs in their own breakout group"https://twitter.com/MarkJKim_/...Here is an activist from the event tweeting about it:"Black only healing space for the students to share, decompress, be vulnerable & real. #ConcernedStudent1950 "https://twitter.com/Nettaaaaaa...Here is a conservative source with a story line:http://www.theblaze.com/storie...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, groups separate based on race. Especially at Mizzou, where race is a problem even for people who are working to make race stop  being a problem (I taught there for five years). Can you see that you made a destructive narrative, connecting dots in a way the facts did not warrant, for the apparent purpose of delegitimating their concerns? That would be a big, big part of what they're angry about.</comment>

<comment>If you want to avoid the n-word, better stay away from campuses with African-Americans.My own personal record for most recorded instances of the n-word was on the college campus I attended. Two African-Americans used the n-word very loudly on the bus about 50 times in a few minutes of conversation.They seemed to want the whole bus to hear it.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure they did. Was your black best friend with you, too?</comment>

<comment>My college room-mate was a Black dude from the ghetto,  white boy.BTW, please use upper case when writing "Black" - your use of lower case smacks of white racial superiority.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure he was.</comment>

<comment>That would be White Boy.</comment>

<comment>Play that funky music, alright!</comment>

<comment>Please initiate and maintain "funky" sonic vibrations, by means of percussive, stringed and/or horned instrumentation, until your vital bodily functions cease...white boy.</comment>

<comment>Well, there's worse songs to have stuck in your head on a Monday morning.</comment>

<comment>Check your privilege.</comment>

<comment>They did and do. You know quite well it's in-group signaling and social boundary marking. White people do it too, well, country white people, at least, usually with liberal application of RealTree camo to every available surface. Large trucks and hunting rifles and mud are also important signals. I can say this, half my family is country white. ;)</comment>

<comment>What a horrible choice. Either subject oneself to the n-word on a campus with African-American presence, or avoid the n-word by being on a segregated  white campus  ( I never heard a white student use the n-word on my campus).</comment>

<comment>I suggest we all defuse the inherent tension with a marathon of Boondocks on Adult Swim.</comment>

<comment>Creation of safe spaces would require content restriction of speech (not to mention exclusion based on race, gender, sexual orientation, religion, etc) in locations outside of the classroom.  It would be unconstitutional for public universities to do this.</comment>

<comment>“You have created a space for us to fear for our lives, and you continue to maintain that space,” the students said in unison. “Duke, you are guilty.” “I do not feel safe as a black female at Duke,” Katrina Miller told him. A female Asian American student, weeping, said, “If everything had gone according to plan...I would have been another suicide because I don’t feel safe here. I don’t feel that I belong here.”I think that what is clear here, is that young people ( and not only young people ) generally have a much high sense of anxiety about the future than college students did 30 years ago, for example.Between the crushing student loan debt, the diminished job prospects and pessimism/lack of trust in government leaders - they are boiling over in a generalized anxiety - and simply lashing out blindly at the nearest thing in reach, the college administration.And even though college administrators have nothing to do with "safe space" fears - the administrators are actually worthy of attack for other reasons - being useless fatcats with bloated salaries.</comment>

<comment>Why wouldn't a black female feel safe at Duke? Of all places...</comment>

<comment>Going to a school built by tobacco money doesn't sound PC to me.</comment>

<comment>Some people cannot feel safe going outside the comfort zone of their victimized status. It is understandable,  but not to be encouraged or praised.</comment>

<comment>So you've explained the minorities who seem afraid of a community where racial slurs and targeted death threats are shrugged off.How do you explain the folks that are deathly afraid of Syrian mothers and children?  Hmm.  Maybe anxiety is just becoming a default American state?</comment>

<comment>Clearly, we're ALL watching way too much TV.We should stop doing that.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>I'm as skeptical of the students' problems with free speech as anyone. But free speech does not extend to specific threats and defacement of property. I don't blame Black or gay students for feeling unsafe when nooses and death threats against gay people appear near where they sleep and study.Part of it is probably action-reaction. The people defacing things with racist and homophobic graffiti could be partly motivated by the increased attention to it in light of recent protests, rather than genuinely racist or homophobic. They may think the whole thing is a joke or no big deal, but death threats are a pretty big deal. One answer there is to expel any student found to have done these things. I would also suggest turning them over for criminal prosecution. The culprits, if they are students, might be deterred if the stakes were so high. Another answer is asking all students to use empathy. Yes, trigger warnings for literature is arguably silly. But wondering if some graffiti signals an actual threat to your person is not silly.</comment>

<comment>"..I don't blame Black or gay students for feeling unsafe when nooses and death threats against gay people...".I don't want to sound insensitive (:-), but I think that the odds of a Black student being lynched by hanging on a college campus are less than the odds of the earth being destroyed by simultaneous impact of a comet and an asteroid.</comment>

<comment>Admittedly, no one is likely going to be literally lynched. But I'd still be pretty rattled, if I were Black, and might still wonder if there was a risk of getting roughed up if not killed. I think that although the risk is low, the fear is understandable. A noose is a pretty pointed message in the South.</comment>

<comment>I haven't heard of any campuses where Blacks were being roughed up or killed by non-Blacks.I might have missed something, though. What have you heard?</comment>

<comment>http://www.buzzfeed.com/tamerr...^No big deal, this was only a week ago.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...^And hey, who cares, this was just the burning of a church in Charlotte.</comment>

<comment>You have...nothing.</comment>

<comment>You do sound insensitive. Also, I doubt you have a personal finger on the pulse of what atrocity's going to happen next.Remember guys, we're not talking about the right to free speech constitutionally. We're talking about a highly regarded school with a very low acceptance rate. This is a curated environment. Not expelling a person who makes threats is condoning their behavior.</comment>

<comment>WTF? What Ivy League school failed to expel a student threatening to lynch a Black student?  Are you for real?</comment>

<comment>If these instances of threatening/overtly bigoted vandalism were actually tied to specific people, they should be punished, and passed along to the police if their offence is severe enough.  But if any such suspect had been convicted or even formally accused in these instances, the author neglected to mention them.  Students cannot expect the administration to be able to identify, try, convict, and punish every single event of vandalism on campus.  Getting angry, crying, or threatening to hold your breath until your school president magically finds the culprit is just insane.</comment>

<comment>I don't think it's the place of school authorities either. File a police report. If there's grounds for criminal charges it will move forward, if not, it won't. School authorities can expel students who deface university property with racist or threatening graffiti. That's not going to be easy to prove, of course.</comment>

<comment>I suppose this means another $100,000,000.</comment>

<comment>For me? Oh, you shouldn't have!</comment>

<comment>“I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.” (from Dune, by Frank Herbert)</comment>

<comment>It's bad if someone hangs a noose, whether that person is a white racist or (as recent history suggests is more likely) an activist / agitator who is perpetrating a hoax because a noose on campus is such a valuable weapon in the victimhood culture of the American university.It's reasonable for students to expect the university to investigate the noose and expel someone if they find compelling evidence pointing to the perpetrator.It's also reasonable to expect that the perpetrator was clever enough not to get caught, and we can't go firing administrators willy-nilly just because they can't root out every bad apple.Most of all, it's reasonable for adults to expect twenty-somethings to be able to deal with these silly affronts and recognize them for what they are: juvenile attempts to stir up trouble. Calling a Town Hall and indulging these whiney kids simply raises the stakes and ensures more phony hate crimes are coming in the future.</comment>

<comment>Actual threats to person or property should be looked into not only by the university but by law enforcement, obviously. Other than that, there is no way for any university to create an environment where people won't hear or see something offensive. It just isn't possible.</comment>

<comment>What complete bullshit.The students point to incidents that are clearly offensive (a poster defaced with the N-word; a racial epithet scrawled on a dorm corridor; students wearing blackface at a party) but talk about them as if they were life-threatening ("You have created a space for us to fear for our lives," says one; "students who are afraid for their lives need protection and a plan, not patience or promises"; and, "I shouldn’t have to feel obligated to call my mother every night to tell her that I survived another day at Duke.")And as immature teenagers conflate these two very different things, the university administration sits by timidly and silently.Instead of catering and kowtowing to students who are either genuinely paranoid or pretending to be paranoid for political purposes, the adults at Duke should be trying to put things into perspective; there is a tremendous difference between speech that is ugly and offensive and a genuine threat to life and limb. (Has there been a single racially-motivated murder at Duke? Is there any reason to think this is a genuine possibility? Does anyone really believe that a Duke student who scrawls an epithet will actually kill?)The pain of hearing a racial slur and the fear death and dismemberment are two very different things that require very different responses, but apparently Duke's administration does not have the courage to educate the teenagers who were sent to them to be educated.And this failing is especially destructive in a nation that believes in freedom and democracy. There is no safe space in a democracy, nor can there be, nor should there be; a democracy is a messy rough-and-tumble world where fellow citizens and presidential candidates will say things that are ugly, offensive, and untrue. Part of the job of an American university is to prepare citizens to live in a democracy, and places like Duke are failing miserably.</comment>

<comment>I think you're misinterpreting this.At it's core, PC culture is not a thought process or a critique or even a political movement.It's a faith.  Either you're a BELIEVER or you're not.The author of this piece was sharing his conversion story.Road to Damascus moment and all of that.While I'm an agnostic Jew myself, I have a lot of respect for religious belief.Coddled Millennials, who have spent their lives in a bubble of helicopter parenting, participation trophies, and grade inflation, who are now at $60k a year colleges while their less well healed peers lose limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan, unsurprisingly find their lives lacking in meaning.Because Jesus is unfashionable, they've had to find a way to re-package  prototypically American Puritanical urges.  Predictably, this leads to grotesqueries and deformations.It's the same reason that the  Communist countries almost universally devolve to hero worship and the cult of personality.This is a long way of saying that the best response may not be to make reasoned arguments, but to point out to PC adherents that they are praying to false gods.</comment>

<comment>So what I want to know is:Where is S. I. Hayakawa when you need him?</comment>

<comment>But this is the kind of religion that seems to hold that only the "others" are sinful and only they, the true believers, are without sin.They are offering us a kind mash-up of 17th Century Ranters and Fifth Monarchists and 20th Century totalitarians.</comment>

<comment>It is a mash up.  My take on the three main ingredients:1) Victorian primness2) A specific strain of Progressivism akin to that of the Prohibitionists3) Puritanical weirdThat said there's also a liberal dash of authoritarianism lite, goosestepping drills around the playground and all that, and protest for goodies à la Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers.</comment>

<comment>For example, you believe "rape culture" is a problem although empirical evidence doesn't support your claims.You believe in it, even though it is not even a thing, but a grab bag of different rhetorical arguments.You might cry, or have to run to a safe space (at Brown), when your dogma is questioned.You congregate with other believers.You believe that by adhering to these beliefs you are morally elevated over those who don't share them .You suffer great emotional distress when someone disagrees with you; it's likely that those who disagree with you do so because of a moral deficiency.You see?  There's a difference making between an empirically verifiable epidemiological claim, and taking something on faith/having it be a matter of faith.When someone disagreeing with you "harms you," "terrorizes," is a "form of genocide," etc. etc. we've crossed over to a strange place.  If they're not attacking your "faith," what is it that they're doing?</comment>

<comment>I don't think it is subjective.There's simply no campus rape epidemic.Rape on campus is no more a problem than murder, armed robbery, or assault.  All are terrible crimes, but they happen less frequently than they do outside college.However, the trend was/is to expand the definition of "rape" to bring more people into the fold.  (As a form of evangelizing?) Instead of an experience shaping identity, you have identity shaping experience, in that more and more things are "rape.""Naturally, people with similar held values will congregate, religion or otherwise."Sure, but when have people congregated this way over social issues? Abortion, pro life or pro choice?  Ok I get that.  Vietnam War, Civil Rights Movement?  Ok.  Non-existent rape epidemic?  It's crusaders in search of a cause.I think there's something very sad about it all.  While (again), I'm an agnostic Jew, I'm a big fan of Jesus.  Regardless whether you believe he was the son of God, he was the most important moral philosopher in Western history.  I get taking satisfaction from religion.  Or from your family or from your job, for that matter.For Millennials I think there's something that's fundamentally missing.  Some vacancy.  The ones who attend these schools haven't had to overcome anything.  They're not hedonists and don't seem to take a lot of joy in pleasure (another strike against them).  They've been told how great they are their whole lives, have excelled via marmishness, and then end up with diminished expectations in crappy jobs.And so you're looking for some greater meaning or purpose, while at the same time thinking you're much brighter and more wise to the world then you actually are.  (And there's an element of screaming for attention.)  So you get "rape culture" and BLM and so on and so forth, which is more than a set of beliefs or a "social movement" (whatever that is).  There's a religiosity to it, this fervor of acting like pin pricks are gaping head wounds. (Procession of martyrs.)Personally, I don't think that based on my political beliefs I'm more moral than anyone else.  I think I'm more right, and that there's value to seeing the world as it is.  Great moral social issues are behind us, another irony of contemporary activism, with the exception of abortion, which I'm ambivalent about.So I can't prove my thesis about the religiosity of the left, because it's just an impression that you get.  But I live in NY and I've been thinking about it much longer than it's been a center-right meme.</comment>

<comment>That thought process makes NO sense. "but to some people any rape occurring would be evidence of a rape culture." How can that make any logical sense?Step 1: all cultures are 'rape cultures' because the crime has happened in every culture in human history.Step 2: The adjective should be taken away, as if there are no anti-rape or rape-avoidant cultures there is no balance. Rape culture becomes just culture.Step 3: Discard argument, as it is facetious.A culture cannot be characterized by a one-off crime!</comment>

<comment>Except that when both researchers and advocates talk about "Rape Culture" they reference the wider culture and then attempt to use campus life as evidence.  That is why referencing the FBI statistics is such a potent counter to the meme.</comment>

<comment>Have you ever wondered why those exercising this "free speech" are CONSISTENTLY students from the racial group that has benefited from slavery, racism and all manner of bigotry within the culture?A Palestinian professor was fired in Illinois for the free speech that had him objecting to Israeli terrorism during the Gaza massacre. No defense there for "free speech".Do you think an Islamic student wearing a costume of planes flying into the  twin towers for Halloween would not evoke anger and calls for dismissal by white students?Democracy does not equal instilling fear and repression against minorities! It's not a license for majority groups to abuse those who have little power to fight back! Hanging a noose in front of black people is not democracy nor is it a "childish prank". It's a signal of hatred and a reminder of the power the majority community used to have on minorities and how many from the majority wishes to hold on to that fast slipping power.</comment>

<comment>When I see symbols of violence displayed openly, I feel dread, even though I am not likely the target audience -- at this particular time and place. Pranks in the singular have a way of devolving into mission creep that expands towards violence if repeatedly executed and left unaddressed.</comment>

<comment>"Do you think an Islamic student wearing a costume of planes flying into the twin towers for Halloween would not evoke anger and calls for dismissal by white students?"No.  And if some such people did, then they would be laughed at by me and by most all people who were born before 1980.</comment>

<comment>Stop telling lies! You are the very people that support shutting down mosques and preventing Moslems building them in Manhattan!</comment>

<comment>Uh, the last time I checked, people like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X were just some of the many who used the First Amendment to protect their protests from police behavior. While I'm sure the cops did some things out of sight, they were officially prevented from shutting down the protests.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Petrow, the alleged incident at UCLA, the blackface during a "Kanye Western" party, never happened. According to witnesses, some young women dressed up as gold miners—a reference to the Kanye West song "Gold Digger"—and their costumes included dirt on their faces. Someone misinterpreted the dirt as "blackface."</comment>

<comment>We should give the students at Duke and other Universities exactly what they are asking for, colorblind fairness and equality based on achievement and test scores.  We can then watch the number of Asian and Indian students increase and watch the number of white and black students decrease.</comment>

<comment>We should just get the government out of the education business entirely.</comment>

<comment>The right-wing freak out over "political correctness" on college campuses is a nothingburger, just like all of its other freak outs are nothingburgers. Remember when Ebola was going to kill us all? Or when migrant children from Latin America were going to take over the country? Or when the "Ground Zero" "Mosque" was going to be a command center for terrorism? Or when gay marriage was going to destroy Western Civilization? Or when Obama was going to take away all of the guns?Yeah, we're still waiting for any of those predictions to come true (any day now!). Color me skeptical that some overly zealous (and relatively powerless) college kids are going to destroy the First Amendment.</comment>

<comment>So Salon is right wing now?  The New Republic?   President Obama?What's interesting about the current "freak out", as you so eloquently put it, is that now it's coming from the political left.</comment>

<comment>Remember when the Obama Administration fired Shirley Sherrod because (according to the right-wing press) she was a frothing racist? And remember how that turned out not to be true?Believe it or not, some times liberals are foolish enough to be swept up in the right's fevered hatefests. That doesn't mean they're legitimate or grounded in reality.</comment>

<comment>Believe it or not, some times liberals are foolish enough to be swept up in the right's fevered hatefests.Usually, this takes the form of reactive opposition.  Agreeing with Fox News is a rather peculiar position for a bunch of left leaning academics to take, and requires a bit more than handwaving on your part to explain.From reading the articles, it rather seems that left-leaning faculty in free speech academia are coming into genuine conflict with a left-leaning culture birthed in the blogosphere that is based on fragmentation and group validation.</comment>

<comment>It is a problem on college campuses, no doubt. I just find the wailing and gnashing of teeth to be a bit much. Haven't college students always been overly zealous? Is the current wave of protesting anything we haven't seen before?</comment>

<comment>Probably not, but it's been almost 20 years since the tail end of the last political correctness movement, so there are a lot of people in academia today who don't remember it very well, if at all.</comment>

<comment>I don't know. America survived the last PC movement, and it will survive this one. Hell, it may even do some good! I'd rather kids be politically engaged than not, and it's unlikely that they'll carry their more extreme positions with them into their adult lives.</comment>

<comment>Yes, America will be fine.  But I don't see these movements in the positive light you do; there tend to be too many people whose lives and careers fall victim to witch hunts on both sides.  I think America's students, and chattering class, would be better off spending their energy elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>Eh. I haven't been following all of the protests extremely closely, but it seems as though the only ones who have lost their jobs so far are Tim Wolfe and R. Bowen Loftin. I can't shed too many tears for multi-millionaires who will undoubtedly find lucrative work elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>Melissa Click, the journalism professor at the Mizzou protest who was caught on tape calling for "muscle" lost her appointment.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that a good thing, though? That whole situation was extremely overblown (to put it mildly), but she made the right move by resigning.</comment>

<comment>She lost her courtesy appointment in another faculty (Journalism - oh the irony, it burns), but she's still a professor in the Communications faculty.Thank about it - a PROFESSOR ordered students to rough up (at best) another student, and she's still a professor.  How does that make any sense?</comment>

<comment>Except for Mizzou, these protests have been happening at tiny, exclusive private colleges. These schools are ultra-competetive to get into, so the students there are probably a bit over-wrought to begin with.</comment>

<comment>She didn't say it?How did it turn out "not to be true?"</comment>

<comment>Because she was completely taken out of context, which Breitbart admitted to later? Were you in a coma during the summer of 2010?</comment>
