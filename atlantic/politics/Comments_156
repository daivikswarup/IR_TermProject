<comment>White people need to shut up and listen. Any criticism of Obama by white people is racism.</comment>

<comment>you must be the low IQ blacks that kill each other</comment>

<comment>The only low IQ are racist white trash that won't vote for Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>The amount of rekt'd i would put on you would make your kid's great grand kids cry in 30 years</comment>

<comment>Stahp it!</comment>

<comment>Seriously. What's the point in trolling when everyone knows you're doing it?(I know what the actual point is, of course.)</comment>

<comment>The real trolls are white people who don't vote for Bernie sanders.</comment>

<comment>Ya know what your real problem is? When it comes to disasters, Obama can't hold a candle to the Repub presidencies, and your herculean efforts to cause it to be such, or even just appear to be that way, never bore fruit. IWO, he beat you by letting you beat your own heads against a wall of your own making. He||, you even got control of both houses, and continue to be unable to advance your day 1 agenda of bringing him down. You lost. If you really "want your country back" you need to own your sh!t, get serious, pick up the pieces, and move forward. IOW grow the fvck up, and cut the crap, because you are just making yourselves look crazy.Edited for clarity</comment>

<comment>He think he's making a funny.</comment>

<comment>Oy veh!</comment>

<comment>Obama is half white .. therefore, white people can't be racist toward Obama</comment>

<comment>Fool.</comment>

<comment>Wonder how many times he will reference himself?</comment>

<comment>That would be a good bet considering he's talking about the issues and how they relate to his presidency.</comment>

<comment>...as they relate to his failed presidency. I would rather watch reruns of the Howdy Doody Show.</comment>

<comment>hmmm.    His?   he is the "union"?   No.   Try to think about what the "STATE OF THE UNION" means.   Break each word down and think about it.   It is not about a person.</comment>

<comment>Who is running the union? Who did we elect to do this? Who is seen both nationally and internationally as the head of our union? Come on fam.</comment>

<comment>So you concede, the word WE should be used by a leader of US?   hmmm.   WE will see.</comment>

<comment>Wonder how many times he will reference himself?"What does it matter?  No matter how hard he tries, the poor guy'll never keep pace with Trump.</comment>

<comment>Trump has not been the leader of this country for the last 7 years.</comment>

<comment>Neither has Obama.</comment>

<comment>I'll guess no.</comment>

<comment>The answer is no! The empty chair is symbolic of the empty suit at the podium. Here is a guy so out of touch that he still wants to push more Syrian refugees at us? Has he talked to Germans or to Merkel lately? Good riddence!</comment>

<comment>The SOTU address not worth any bother regardless of who is doing it. It should revert to written form. It's been a wasteland for longer than I can remember. The "heroes gallery" instituted by St Ronnie was the final straw.</comment>

<comment>I can already tell you what the tone of tonight's speech will be like. And, most of us who watch, will have a cloudy, dark, uneasy feeling after he leaves the room. We will feel defeated, depressed and have little to cheer about. We will feel taken in, divided and lied to...we will feel naked because our rights will have been stripped from us regarding our right to bear arms. We will feel lectured to, dictated to and feel that something terrible has gone wrong with our entire way of living. We will feel watched, taxed and jobless...but we will not be defeated.</comment>

<comment>"our rights will have been stripped from us regarding our right to bear arms"Factually speaking, those rights have expanded more in the past eight years than at any point in US history.</comment>

<comment>It is a whiners delight.</comment>

<comment>I will watch reruns instead of the crazy queer neeger</comment>

<comment>Obama has been overall a disappointment.  He has governed from the center on several of most of the important issues -- to his credit.  He kept us out of war.  He kept spending under control relative to his predecessor Bush.  Like Bush, however, he is addicted to big government  and reckless deficit spending.  Like Bush, he is committed to open borders. Obama's biggest failure is how divisive his 7 years have been. I understand Republicans blocked many of his economic initiatives.  That is normal in our democracy like ours.  The point of a leader is to unite, to find common ground.  Clearly, Obama was never interested in finding common ground.  Obama will go down in history as the Great Divider.  The Democrats are now running a socialist (Sanders) and a "Progressive Democrat" (Clinton) for the party's nomination.  Where did my party go?  This is now a party where 46% sympathize with the hate group Black Lives Matter.</comment>

<comment>Well said. At least some of us are saying no to all Establishment candidates, especially corrupt ones. And we are smart enough to never fall for a socialist candidate.Obama encouraged the divide with Sharpton, DOJ Eric Holder/Lynch, De Blasio style politics, Harry Reid, Nancy Pelosi, and the media moving further to the left with the Identity politics dividing us even further.And the ambush of 2014 unvetted illegal migrants encouraged to cross the border, unvetted refugees being pushed to western countries for multicultural reasons, red lines being crossed in Syria with no repercussions, and having no answer to ISIS. Gitmo release! And our US constitution being threatened!And the worst income inequality, with nothing done to help except more entitlement to the poor, and letting rich get richer with investment income, with no trickle down of job growth due to Obamacare, and foreign imports.Basically we've had no leadership. </comment>

<comment>only blacks, jews and kweers watch him anymore</comment>

<comment>^^^^^^Social Justice Warrior, ignore</comment>

<comment>Has he ever?</comment>

<comment>All of Obama's accomplishments listed in the above article and anti accomplishments to me. The only things I want to hear about Obama is 1) how to prevent more Obama damage, and 2) How to reverse the above Obama damage.</comment>

<comment>It's time for Obama to finally let white people know what he really thinks of them. He's been holding back for too long now, but elections are over - let them have it.</comment>

<comment>Only if he tears a rotator patting himself on the back for nothing.</comment>

<comment>Obama is the worst president ever ... but Hillary could top that</comment>

<comment>Obama's presidency has been quite successful on a few levels. Calling him the worst president ever, only shows your lack of knowledge in history or really any critical thinking skills if you think Dubya's presidency was better.</comment>

<comment>Mr. Obama will be judged a great man and President.  Foretold by the king of trolls to his minions in quite frustration.http://news.yahoo.com/air-stri...</comment>

<comment>Obama's speeches text alone will show him a buffoon to future generations.It is the point of view of a petulant child.</comment>

<comment>LOL.  The echo of troll chagrin.</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action cannot get him in to the list of good Presidents.</comment>

<comment>Of course it could when the Bundys of this world were the gatekeepers.</comment>

<comment>What are the odds Barry will mention the skyrocketing costs of health care or the increase in crime under his watch?</comment>

<comment>Healthcare is increasing in cost at about 1/4 to 1/3 the rate it did prior to the ACA.</comment>

<comment>And ISIS is contained.</comment>

<comment>And poverty has risen 25% since 2008, and that the labor force participation rate slipped to a 38 year low last year, and that wages have not grown since he took office, and that he allowed Assad to cross the red line, and that he gave nukes to Iran, and that he allowed Putin to take Crimea, and that he has brought terrorism to US soil, ....in short, he fucked America and made the world a more dangerous place.  It proves any idiot can be president of the US.</comment>

<comment>An African American has not swayed racists and bigots, but of course it is his fault.</comment>

<comment>He said "bigot" ....Drink!</comment>

<comment>No.If his lips move he is lying.Obama is only playing to morons and racists and I am neither.BTW - idiot BLM fools, I voted for Cynthia McKinney, so STFU.  You use the "n" word?  YOU ARE THE RACIST PROBLEM.</comment>

<comment>Why is the Bureau of Land Management fools? Simply because they don't want to give the Bundys a bunch of free land?</comment>

<comment>They just want to turn it over to China to mine uranium.You should not be so gullible and naive, kid.</comment>

<comment>The Bundys want to turn over a bird sanctuary to China to mine uranium? Wow! For a bunch of cosplaying cowboys that forgot to bring snacks, that's a pretty devious plan.</comment>

<comment>You sir, are a moron.</comment>

<comment>Based on your documented ability to assess reality I will take that as a huge compliment.</comment>

<comment>Morons tend to think like that.</comment>
