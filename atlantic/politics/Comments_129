<comment>Politics as usual. The war with Japan only lasted 3-1/2 years. It is amazing what America can accomplish when everybody pulls in the same direction.</comment>

<comment>Japan was badly outclassed.  Germany was a bigger problem.Perhaps a better comparison might be with Florida's bridge-building record.  There's relatively few messes.  One is the dinky old Venetian Causeway from Miami to Miami Beach; another, the Sunshine Skyway, a young bridge spanning Tampa Bay that turns out to not be high enough for the latest generation of cruise ships.Portland, Oregon has been accused of corruption in the building of light rail and streetcars, but overall the system looks pretty cheap and effective.  But the I-5 bridges across the Columbia River will be replaced only when one is closed or collapses.</comment>

<comment>In 1993, 100% of the Clinton stimulus package went to infrastructure repair and development.  It failed without getting even 1 republican vote.In 2009, only 7% of obama's stimulus package went to infrastructure repair and development.Outside of the Clintons, when will this nation's media and political class get serious?Fuk the email bullshite and lets discuss out nation's crumbling backbone.</comment>

<comment>It would be nice to compare costs as well.  How much does it cost per mile to build bridges in the US compared to say London or Japan or compare one state to the next.The Tappen Zee used less steel when originally built because of war time shortages (Korean War).  The bridge was only supposed to last 50 years, it is expected to last 62 years, if the new bridge opens in 2017.</comment>

<comment>"Likewise, the cost of San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge’s new eastern span increased from $250 million to $6.4 billion, in part, because local architects, planners, engineers, and elected officials wanted an 'elegant' and 'graceful' world-class design to rival the Golden Gate Bridge."The Bay Bridge collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Know the best parts of the repair job? It wasn't done right, and it's not done yet. Twenty-six years and counting to fix a portion of something that originally took three years and four months to build in its entirety. And whether because of the design, the installation, or the materials, parts of the new structure are already rotting away and will likely require replacement to achieve the stated seismic safety requirements. Open your wallets, Californians!Oh, and as for holding anyone accountable? Those "local architects, planners, engineers, and elected officials"?  Good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>And, of course, every airport control tower is designed differently - as well as every nuclear reactor.  Only in America.</comment>

<comment>Only if we would have used a Standard Reactor Design, like the USSR did.The  RBMK worked fine, till it didn't at Chernobyl</comment>

<comment>Don't confuse design with operation.</comment>

<comment>Bad design+ clueless operators=disaster</comment>

<comment>I am so glad to see this shortcoming of "exceptional" America called out. After all, France has been fulfilling 75% of its residential electric power needs with highly-standardized nuclear plants for decades.</comment>

<comment>the problem was using Chinese contractors. Serves them right for not using Americans.</comment>

<comment>Until the U.S. includes the ancillary costs of business-as-usual in addressing its transportation requirements we are doomed. There are only so many trillion-dollar oil wars Americans will be willing to fight -- or able to afford -- in this century.Saudi Arabia is now trying to cement its market share for the future, exerting its influence on Texas oil and the Republican party to dictate overall American energy policy, all the while quietly providing the protection money that keeps radical Wahhabi Islam in business.We're now using U.S. taxpayer-financed smart bombs to blow up U.S. taxpayer-funded (and captured) Humvees in the deserts of Iraq. That's crazy.</comment>

<comment>AM General and Raytheon love the idea though!"We're now using U.S. taxpayer-financed smart bombs to blow up U.S. taxpayer-funded (and captured) Humvees in the deserts of Iraq. That's crazy."</comment>

<comment>"To appease voters, politicians often add expensive and unnecessary costs. For example, the cost of Boston’s Big Dig project ballooned from $2.6 billion to $14.8 billion as a result of costly features and accommodations to address community concerns."Delays had an enormous role in ballooning the costs of the Big Dig, as did several first-ever engineering feats necessary to complete the project without displacing homes or businesses and to combat the reality that the majority of the tunnels are in filled land, which is very unstable.  The coda, however, is that the Big Dig unlocked untold billions in economic development by reconnecting downtown and the waterfront, shortening the time to the airport (which has lately been successful in scoring a huge number of new international routes), lessening backups along the critical I-93 corridor through Boston, and perhaps most importantly, in removing physical barriers to the long-stagnant Seaport/Fort Point districts, which are now flush with new office buildings (including the Vertex Pharmaceuticals HQ, which at $800 million was the largest purely private development in the US during its construction), housing, restaurants, museums, the 1st Circuit courthouse, and one of the largest convention centers in the country.  Just five days ago, another $700 million project was announced; an already-financed project to build 3x 22-story towers of new condos and apartments.  https://www.bostonglobe.com/bu...  Over the long run, the Big Dig will be a massive economic boon to the city.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  I lived and worked in the Boston area while the Big Dig was happening and the inconvenience of the project over the course of many years was well worth it in the end.  Removing that elevated I-93 highway completely changed the character of the waterfront for the better.  It turned Boston from a little provincial outpost into a world-class city, IMO.  I visited Boston last summer after having been on the west coast for 15 years and was really impressed with the place.  It was definitely a brilliant investment and Boston is better for it.ETA: I fondly remember one of the construction signs the city posted while they worked on the project:  "Rome wasn't built in a day.  And if it was, we would have hired their contractor."  ;-)</comment>

<comment>It's been so successful that rents and housing prices have become quite insane.  It's the third-most expensive market now, behind NYC and SF.  I mean, the average single-family house sale price in Somerville so far this year has been about $850,000.  Somerville!  Cambridge is well over a million.  And good luck find a non-condemned house for under $400k just about anywhere in eastern Massachusetts these days.</comment>

<comment>I know!  I used to live in No. Reading and I looked up my house on Zillow.  We sold it in 1999 for $430K or thereabouts.  It's now worth almost a million.  On two acres, though, but yeah, it's crazy.</comment>

<comment>2 acres is a pretty big lot for N. Reading.  My firmly middle class hometown suddenly has all manner of places going for $1 to $2 million and up.  Look at it this way: $1 million these days wouldn't get you an empty lot in the really nice towns that start with a "W."</comment>

<comment>How long is the time to break-even?</comment>

<comment>Depending on how you measure it, we've likely already crossed the break-even point.  There has been billions and billions in new construction across the Seaport District and Waterfront that almost certainly would not have happened save for the Big Dig.  Up by the Boston Garden Fleet Center TD Banknorth Center TD Garden at the north end of the I-93 tunnel, there are several massive residential and commercial projects on the empty land that used to be the dead zone around the Central Artery's elevated offramps.  Dozens of companies and thousands of jobs have moved or relocated to the area.  Who-knows-how-much productivity (and gas) saved by having I-93 not resemble a parking lot 18 hours per day.  And by having at least half the traffic from the Sumner and Callahan Tunnels diverted to the Ted Williams Tunnel.  Tourism dollars from having Big Dig dirt cap ugly old Spectacle Island out in the harbor and turning it into a popular park/destination.  Logan had record international traffic last year, aided in no small part by not being a massive pain in the proverbial to get to and from anymore.  International investing in personal and commercial real estate (including in the new neighborhoods the Big Dig catalyzed) in the city is at an all-time high and rivalled by only a few other cities in the world - NYC, London, Miami, and San Francisco.  Etc, etc.  The city has its issues, as does every city, but as we approach the medium-term, the Big Dig has provided enormous returns to Boston.</comment>

<comment>"Former New York Governor Thomas Dewey rejected those locations because they fell within the jurisdiction of a bi-state authority, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Dewey didn’t want toll revenues on the state’s new bridge to be shared with New Jersey,""New York decided not to support New Jersey’s efforts because it saw the project as competition for a Tappan Zee rail line. As a result, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie canceled the tunnel project in 2010; he did not want to raise gax taxes and have his state pay a disproportionate share of the cost."Both of these are hallmarks of big projects that cross a state boundary. It's fairly common any time a CSA or MSA is spread over multiple states. Unfortunately the only solution for NYC would be the splitting off of northern NJ, southern NY, and western CT and merging the three to form a new state.</comment>

<comment>True.  New Hampshire and Massachusetts have had a long, long dance around who/how would fund an extension of two of Boston's commuter rail lines into southern New Hampshire, say to Nashua, Manchester, Portsmouth, and maybe even Concord.  One wonders how Mass and Rhode Island ever got their act together to get a different branch down to Providence and more recently down to TF Green and Wickford.  There are pipe dreams in Rhode Island to continue that route down to the CT border at Westerly and have it meet a theoretical extension of CT's Shore Line East, hence providing commuter/light rail service from Boston all the way to NYC.  I wouldn't hold my breath.</comment>

<comment>And Boston is a minor case, because the majority of greater Boston is in Mass. NYC (CT/NY/NJ), Philly (PA/NJ) and Washington (MD/DC/VA) have borders running right through the middle of the urban areas.</comment>

<comment>Depends on whether you are measuring by MSA or CSA, I think.  Boston's CSA is 6th largest in the US, has considerably more people than the entire population of Massachusetts, (8 million versus 6.7 million, and note that a decent percentage of MA are not in the Boston CSA), and covers about 1/3 of New Hampshire and virtually all of Rhode Island.  Take a look at the map here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/....  But you are right that it is not as evenly spread as greater NYC or DC, of course.</comment>

<comment>The unions, the bookies, the judges, the senators....the bridges...Thanks Don Michael!</comment>

<comment>This shrewd analysis is exactly the kind of article that the Atlantic does very well.</comment>

<comment>Rockland county is on the western side of the TZ Bridge. It is the second highest taxed county in the US (Westchester is first.) Over 5% of it's houses are in foreclosure. For sale signs are abundant as people try to flee before bankruptcy. Average per capita income is about $50,000. but our cops, whose jobs are 85% traffic control(tickets) average $165,000/yr + $4o,ooo in bene's. Teachers average $108,000/yr with the best didtricts barely cracking the top 30% in the State. In my town, the head of the parks department got a 39% raise to $140,000 yet the parks were closed for 6 months due to lack of funds. Seems up here, if you make your money off the taxpayers, you had no recession in 2008. Rockland County has a $160 million debt. The 5 towns all carry tens of millions of debt. Just over 50% of the budgets go for salaries and benefits. Two of it's largest employers Pfizer and Novartis have left town taking millions in property tax and thousands of high paying jobs with them. But the public sector unions have bribed their way to annual raises and continued no contribution benefits. There is just no more money left in the private sector till for silly little things like infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>Politics.  The only reason why these projects spiral out of control cost-wise is because the politicians are trying to serve too many masters.  And then when you have two political jurisdictions having input, it makes it worse. Public input is important prior to the RFP process, but once the scope has been sent out, that should be the end of major changes to the design and/or features.Maybe the lesson learned here is that if a civil engineeering project involves more than one state it defaults to the purview of the Feds?</comment>

<comment>See that big section of bridge being positioned by the crane in the picture? The whole section was built in China, if it was anything like the SF-Oakland Bay Bridge construction. Then they ship sections over, and a small, temporary crew puts the sections in place. In other words, all the actual stimulus happens in China.</comment>

<comment>Some of the tunnel sections used in the Big Dig were built in Baltimore and brought up by barge.</comment>

<comment>How do we get Americans to pay the true costs of what they use? That's the central question of the future. The subsidies of the suburban-industrial complex created such profound imbalances, it will take hard work and sacrifice to recreate a nation in which the costs of infrastructure spending are not shifting onto those who don't use it.</comment>

<comment>How do we get Americans to realize that they benefit from infrastructure projects even if they never "use" them? So that "shifting" is fully justified. (E.g. how do you think flat screen TVs, say, get from shipping ports to, say, warehouse stores in Iowa? *cough*roads*cough*bridges*cough* And what do you think is the major wear-and-tear producer on said infrastructure? *cough*trucks*cough*)</comment>

<comment>I disagree. I think that making the connection between users and payers stronger is the answer. Americans have become used to getting something for nothing and this has distorted their private decisions about how and where to invest and live. If people have to pay for what they use, they'll use it more efficiently.</comment>

<comment>You want an itemized list of tolls paid attached to each flat screen TV shipped? And included in the price explicitly? Do you realize how expensive (and ridiculous) your dream is?</comment>

<comment>It's no dream. Tolls work well to pay for Europe's and Asia's superior infrastructure.  You are suggesting that Americans can't afford their infrastructure? That road use must be subsidized? That's preposterous. If America can't pay its way, the county won't survive. Other infrastructure has to pay its way, why not roads? I</comment>

<comment>You're not listening. You do "use" roads that you do not drive on -- see the shipping example. There is no good way for you to pay for THAT usage except general taxation.</comment>

<comment>YOU'RE not listening. General taxation isn't paying for roads. Foreign purchasers of U.S. government bonds are. Americans aren't paying for the roads they use, foreigners are. Our road funding is part of the cause of our deficit.</comment>

<comment>It seems we agree at least that Americans are not paying enough in taxes. Can we leave it at that?</comment>

<comment>The author writes, "While project costs have increased due to inflation ...". That's true, of course, but immaterial. The real driver of costs is the meteoric rise in "studies" and lawsuits attending every major and most minor projects. The majority of the cost of such projects as the Tappan Zee has very little to do with construction -- though the artificially high labor costs do also take their toll.</comment>
