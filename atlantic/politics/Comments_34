<comment>Anybody who pulls a trigger on an unarmed person should never be allowed to carry a gun again. It just makes sense. We have to stop letting cops bamboozle us with all of this talk about threats and procedures and start using common sense. Every time there is a source of independent truth it proves cops lied. Let's get the clue.</comment>

<comment>This is what happens when a man assaults a female officer with his bare hands:  She takes one punch and is on the ground being mounted and pummeled.  Watch that video and tell me she would not have been justified in shooting.  She's alive only because he chose to stop.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>"...not only because the product is relatively knew,"You mean 'new.'</comment>

<comment>If only you new about the increasing lack of proofreeding on this website.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention the lack of moderators.</comment>

<comment>I don't believe that this site has ever had full-time moderators outside of TNC's articles.</comment>

<comment>They act as if they know, when in so many situations, they are making it up as they go along........</comment>

<comment>Indeed, the answer is not software that labels you with a threat-level code. Aside from issues like errors and civil liberty principles, the real problem is the force-first-assess-later attitude of the cops. That's what needs to change.</comment>

<comment>Its training and police culture.</comment>

<comment>It's a proprietary system...no one knows how it works.My guess it's always at red-level. It *ALWAYS* returns maximum threat ranking. This is just an excercise in CYA so they can point to something in court when a pig blows away a little kid "The computer said it was MAXIMUM THREAT!!!!! TECHNOLOGY!!! WOOO WOOOO TECHNOLOGY!"</comment>

<comment>I'm going to go out on a limb and predict that this software will be used to  justify shooting non-threatening individuals.  "The threat level was CODE RED! So I shot him for approaching me with a cucumber salad in his hand."</comment>

<comment>I think that's a very likely outcome. Those cucumber salads are vicious!!!!</comment>

<comment>And while they say it's just a tool, some young cop is going to think red means shoot. It's another tool that you have to train people not to abuse.</comment>

<comment>"If I had a schizophrenic son, I would love a way to register that fact with the emergency-response system so that dispatchers would know to send folks trained to deal with the mentally ill."Registering such information runs against the rules and goals of HIPAA. Making it transparent/open to the public is an even more egregious HIPAA violation. But, it's estimated that 25% of police shootings involve people with severe mental illness. If LEO know going into a situation that the suspect has a history of paranoid, delusional crises and psychosis they could and should manage it from that angle. But LEO also go into situations involving habitual violent felons with guns that have no qualms about killing LEO and innocent bystanders.Balancing the right to privacy against databases that could save the lives of suspects and police officers is a challenge our society will need to address with some commonsense.</comment>

<comment>Possibly, but even when police know about a history of mental illness or autism they still have used force and escalated the incident rather than deescalation (at least here in Florida).</comment>

<comment>Not an expert, but I think you can waive your HIPPA rights.  I've done this.  Not sure if you can waive your minor's rights.  HIPPA is trying to do the right thing, but is loaded with unintended consequences.</comment>

<comment>This software sounds fantastic.Think about the amount of background checks a reputable employer does BEFORE offering someone a job:  social media checks, criminal records check, drug testing, credit checks, if you are in the securities business you have to be fingerprinted, etc.  before an offer for employment is made.  Why wouldn't an employer use these tools available to inform their decision process?Likewise,  if  police can be informed of a person's violent criminal history before interacting with them at a traffic stop or a domestic disturbance call, they should be provided that info.  </comment>

<comment>So you're ok with the potential inaccuracy of a software, when you are not allowed to know the methods by which it works, to label whether people are suitable to employ or not?</comment>

<comment>Yep.Will mistakes occasionally happen?  Certainly.  But software currently prevents people with a history of bad credit and bankruptcies from working with other people's money, pedophiles from driving school buses, people with felony convictions from purchasing guns, and people with a history of drug seeking from tricking doctors and pharmacies into giving them medication they shouldn't have.So on the whole, software has made us safer.  I think cops deserve an opportunity to be safer too.   </comment>

<comment>Pigs make themselves safer by blowing away any 12 year old who looks threatening.Pigging is one of the safer jobs. It's nowhere near the top-10 most dangerous jobs list. And it's *VERY* well paid.</comment>

<comment>That's a very intelligent point you raise. Since policing is less dangerous than other jobs, it follows logically that we shouldn't provide law enforcement additional tools that would make the job safer still.  In fact, we should probably give loggers, fishermen and farmers safety equipment like tasers, handcuffs, and service revolvers since those jobs are statistically more dangerous than police work.Thanks for adding your valuable insight into this discussion. Your erudition has swayed my viewpoint.  </comment>

<comment>Using a color chart is easier. If your skin is the same color as the background of this page,you are safe. If it is closer to the color of the text, you are a danger.</comment>

<comment>"It calculated his threat level as the highest of three color-coded scores: a bright red warning. The man had a firearm conviction and gang associations, so out of caution police called a negotiator."As opposed to when the threat level isn't assessed as high for someone who is ACTIVELY THREATENING HIS GIRLFRIEND. So if the guy lit up as green, would they not have brought a negotiator? Why are "negotiator" and "police officer" two different people? Are the police only trained to shoot people? Like if he had a gun and showed as green, would they say "Oh crap, didn't bring a negotiator. Guess we'll have to shoot this one."</comment>

<comment>"Actively threatening" probably carries a much higher threat level if it is done by a guy with two felony domestic assaults on his record versus a guy who only has a speeding ticket.</comment>

<comment>It could assign an elevated threat level based on tweets or Facebook posts that offer constitutionally protected speech that criticizes police officers or police unions.Conor,I'm generally supportive of your position on civil liberties and so on, but I think you're off base here. If your entire timeline consists of tweets about sticking it to the pigs, even if it's constitutionally protected, it's logical that they should have somewhat more caution than around Joe Blow, depending on the specifics of the situation.Similarly, if someone continually makes Constitutionally protected statements in support of ISIS, the government and its agents shouldn't be able to punish them or restrict their activities, but they're also worth a closer look than your average person off the street.The government shouldn't be able to use your protected speech to punish you, but I think it's blind to pretend that past actions shouldn't factor into current and future assessments. Obviously this dichotomy is somewhat hard to maintain when SWATting is so prevalent, and the price of the cops getting it wrong is so high, but pretending that everyone is the same risk until they actually commit a crime seems rather dense.</comment>

<comment>First rate douchebaggery.  Police forces don't need intelligence collection.  Intelligence collection is a double-edged sword that should only be unsheathed in national security and only in a way that protects the public.  To the extent that on-going investigations into things like gangs can be called intelligence they are forgivable because of their limited nature.  But open source analysis in response to a house-call is massive overreach.  Nothing the police do can justify such a thing.  In the rarest of cases where they are responding to a Paris-style terror attack, all that tech would probably be useless anyway.  This is an unacceptable capability for a police force in a liberal democracy.</comment>

<comment>Friedersdorf states unequivocally that the Beware software "would not have helped to save Tamir Rice" but if he offers any evidence of that I must have missed it.</comment>

<comment>Overtime the Beware software will be racist and discarded.</comment>

<comment>Black is the new red...</comment>

<comment>This is scary. The difference between red and green is probably the difference between life and death. "Threat assessment RED--take the safety's off..."Policies and procedures; a color-coded threat assessment--a great hiding place for the incompetent and inadequate--those who are just following orders...</comment>

<comment>"It could disadvantage low-income people by assigning an elevated threat level to their addresses "I'm pretty sure this is already happening even without software or dispatchers.  Responding officers know what parts of the city are crappy and which places are particularly problematic.</comment>

<comment>"It could assign an elevated threat level based on tweets or Facebook posts that offer constitutionally protected"Remember the phrase "anything you say can and will be used against you"?  That applies to free speech too, which is why if you're going to speak do it anonymously. Also, the same thing is going to happen to properties in States that require registration of firearms.</comment>

<comment>Police departments are now operating with a policy of zero tolerance for risk. And the easiest way to accomplish this is to shoot first and ask questions later.</comment>
