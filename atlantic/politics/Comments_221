<comment>The Republican field of candidates for the presidential primaries seem robust and I'm wondering if any Democrat besides Biden will toss in a hat to challenge Hillary Clinton? Otherwise hers would be an anointment which may or may not bode well for Democrats in the national election.</comment>

<comment>I think the Democrats are making a big mistake in clearly paving the way of H. Clinton to get the nomination. What if she goes massively wrong mid-way through the primaries? Then the Dems have nothing but weak candidates to take her place.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats problem is that there are so few other options. If I am a big donor, I look at the race and think, Hillary's probably going to win. I really doubt Warren or O'Malley or whomever else has any chance of beating her in the primaryLook back at the Republicans in 2012, Mitt Romney locked the race up early. He built an insurmountable delegate lead and it was inevitable that he was ultimately going to win. But Santorum and Gingrich hung around scooping up non-establishment votes here and there and winning small states which forced Romney to keep running. In the course of that he made several gaffes like the "my wife drives several Cadillacs" , "I am not concerned about the poor" and talking about how loves NASCAR because he hangs out with NASCAR team owners. The Obama campaign used these against him. Romney also had to keep spending money.The Democrats are gambling, for sure, but the reality is, like all those challengers in 2012 (Herman Cain, Bachmann, Perry,etc), no one else really has much of a chance. So let Hillary does what she does well - tons of small townhalls, "listening tours", an build a brand and ground game for the general.Longer term, there is a problem with grooming future candidates.</comment>

<comment>I agree the Democrats are much weaker than they appear. They don't have a giant number of cringeworthy candidates like the Republicans of 2012, they just have a bare field. Nobody has broad appeal - yet.</comment>

<comment>And they appear very very weak.</comment>

<comment>I don't think they're clearly paving anything...who else is there? The R bench may be a giant clown car, but at least they have one...</comment>

<comment>Some potential candidates:Joe Biden, V.P.Martin O'Malley, Maryland GovernorBernie Sanders, Sen. from VermontBrian Schweitzer, Governor of North DakotaJim Webb, Sen. from Virginia Elizabeth Warren, Sen. from Massachusetts (not running)All of them should enter the primary to face Clinton and ensure the best candidate gets the nomination. The Dems are only hurting themselves by not having the best primary possible.</comment>

<comment>Look sweetie pie, when someone says they're not running,  you should really stop masturbating over their name.Warren is not running. She said she's not running. I know you want her to be running, but you really need to just face the facts. No one else on your list has the combination of experience, political capital and industrial support than Clinton does. Deal. With. It.When someone else announces, then there will be competition. Currently, it hasn't happened. It will, and that person will have to beat her.Also, you sound like you'll be voting Republican, so why should anyone care what you think about what Democrats should do?</comment>

<comment>The only one talking about sex here is you, badphairy.Elizabeth Warren is a viable presidential candidate, regardless of whether or not she chooses to run. I know she's not running hence the "(not running)" next to her name."No one else on your list has the combination of experience, political capital and industrial support than Clinton does. Deal. With. It."I never said that anyone had equal amounts of support, fundraising etc. I suspect that because they're all "stepping out" of her way, in the sense that they're not actively running with the expectation of reward once she's elected."Also, you sound like you'll be voting Republican, so why should anyone care what you think about what Democrats should do?"I don't really want to vote for H. Clinton, no. I'd vote for some of the other Democrats on that list. I also might vote for Marco Rubio. Not Rand Paul, Jeb Bush or Ted Cruz.Will you call me sweetie pie again? It was really flattering.Edit: I hit the Enter key before I meant to. </comment>

<comment>I wish Webb would run; however, I bet he ends up being the inevitable Democrat Vice President nomineeâ€”no matter who the Democrat President nominee is. He's too politically indespinsable being a former Marine and Virginia Senator.</comment>

<comment>There a only 3 criteria for the Vice president and Webb fails at all of them.1. Help get the president elected:Webb is a bad campaigner, voted into office in a banner year against a bumbling opponent and left office with bad approval ratings. He has shown no more appeal to the Virginian voter then any of the 2 current democratic senators or the democratic governor, sometimes significantly less.2. Not make trouble for the president, but help him:Biden almost wasn't selected as VP because of his tendencies to put his foot in his mouth. Only his completely loyalty to Obama, never crossing the President's legislative agenda publicly, and hard work to defend Obama in the senate kept him on the ticket.Webb is know to be headstrong and take direction badly instead he's likely to follow his own plan. Exceptionally bad traits for a Vice President who is supposed to be a team player since he's or she is elected under the banner of the president. He also brings very little help as a one term senator.3. Being able to step in if the President can not perform their duties.He's a former Republican and significantly to the right of the Democratic party as a whole. Out of step with the mainstream democrats and the other candidates and hopefuls, who are to his left. That ideological divide makes him a bad replacement as he is not likely to continue the policies the public voted the president into office for.Him being a veteran doesn't weigh up against any of that.</comment>

<comment>Not if the rest of her campaign resembles that perfectly cringe-worthy, awful roll-out ad. Whoever was responsible for that disaster needs to be fired - now!</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>They have? I would like a link of that. The announcement ad made perfect sense to me. I liked it. Would be very disappointing.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That isn't really an answer to my question whether or not the add people have been fired.The people who designed the logo are without a doubt a different set of people. Nor do I think the arrow is a sign of her political leanings. Using arrows in logo's has a long history, and as far as I know never signified any partisan leaning. Her voting record is solidly in the middle of the democratic party. Whether or not that makes her a leftist depends on your own interpretation I guess.If you have any information about the campaign firing either the add people or the logo people it would be much appreciated.</comment>

<comment>"may or may not "  well that clears things up</comment>

<comment>It's a real shame how this works today. Most serious candidates are either out of office (e.g., Hillary, Jeb) or are one of a large group where their day-to-day absence won't cause any major problems (Rubio, Paul).Kasich's biggest problem is that he is a man of honor who actually recognizes that as the sitting governor of a large and complex state, he has a job to do. It's ironic, but people with the most responsibility have the most difficult time running for the position with the most responsibility of all.Which leads to the question: what's Biden's excuse for not having a full-blown campaign already?</comment>

<comment>I don't think Biden is the strongest option.  Would much rather see Jerry Brown throw his hat into the ring to challenge Hillary, assuming of course that Warren truly isn't interested in running. (As I commented to Xira, however, I think there might be a chance that Warren will be announced as Hillary's VP choice, which might explain all the campaigning Warren is currently doing.)</comment>

<comment>you are joking of course ..lol why not let Ronald McDonald run?He most certainly has a better chance.</comment>

<comment>Pat asking me if I'm joking?  Oh, that's rich.</comment>

<comment>this is a different Pat.</comment>

<comment>If so, my apologies.  If not, then what I said x10.</comment>

<comment>I'd vote for Jim Webb in a hot minute, just like I would have voted Huntsman in '12.And Webb probably has about as much of a chance at the nomination as Huntsman did. Me and those dark-horse candidates...</comment>

<comment>At least you're consistent?</comment>

<comment>I'm still hoping he won't run. I'm not sure why I would vote for him. I actually think he's been a pretty good Veep, but I have absolutely no need to vote for him for President.</comment>

<comment>My sentiments exactly.</comment>

<comment>I don't buy your theory. Quite a few governors have run for president in recent years--some of them successfully--and it looks like Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin is going to be a serious contender for the Republican nomination this year. Governor is generally considered to be the strongest position from which to run for president. Just like any other office-holder, governors have staff who can do much of the work while the governor is campaigning.</comment>

<comment>Not only is it unfortunate that one has to get a campaign rolling this far out, the length of the campaign season is unbearable for much of the public (at least those that sort of pay attention).The media loves it because is a justification of their existence and an opportunity to spout banalities that are recycled from 4 years prior, but I am not sure it's a better way to vet candidates than if we had the shorter sprint that one sees in parliamentary systems.</comment>

<comment>Amen.  By the end of 2012, I didn't really care who won.  I just wanted it to be over.</comment>

<comment>  if we had the shorter sprint that one sees in parliamentary systems. Too late:http://www.bbc.com/news/magazi...</comment>

<comment>Which is exactly why I've never bought into the idea that the media favors one candidate over another. In 2008, the Clinton campaign kept whining about how the media favored Obama. But the truth is the media loves a horse race, which is why they made sure to give good press to whoever was trailing in the polls and bad press to whoever was out front. It's also why the media is doing everything it can to get Elizabeth Warren to jump into the race. If the Democratic nominee is decided this early, where's the fun in covering that side of the presidential campaign? My prediction is that the media will do everything it can to ensure Hillary and Jeb Bush are the nominees. Why those two? Because they give the most material. Between the Bush family and the Clintons, there's plenty to write about. Who's going to want to hear about Rand Paul's wife or Elizabeth Warren's husband?</comment>

<comment>"The media loves it because" that is where all the money that candidates raise is spent. And that is the real reason. Shorter political seasons would lower their profits significantly.TV stations, networks, cable networks, radio stations, and newspapers make enormous amounts of money on political advertising.</comment>

<comment>I'd vote for that union-busting ahole Kasich just because he's an etnik. I don't agree with the Tea Party but the presidency went from the blue-blood Bushes straight to Barack Hussein Obama. We got skipped, man.I'm kidding, sort of. Actually I'm going to write in Jesse Ventura.</comment>

<comment>There are good reasons for a strong GOP politician to not run.The GOP tends to not select the last candidate to lose a general election, but the runner up from the primaries.  That is now wide open, and there is a slew of upstart Senators and talented/big name Governors with their eyes on the WH.But if you enter, you are already in a very crowded field with a wide spectrum of ideas.  That COULD be good, but its more likely that you are going to get beaten up by fellow Republicans in the primary.  This was very much on display in the last election.Finally, looking at the demographics, a Democrat is strongly favored to win if the economy keeps going in the direction it has been.   You might be able to change the math if you can swing a big state (e.g. Florida, NJ), but otherwise why put yourself up to be shot down in the general election unless you are a true front runner?</comment>

<comment>Warren, you shoulda run.</comment>

<comment>Nah, Warren is like Ted Kennedy, she can do a lot more from a more or less safe Senator position than gambling it all to be President imo.</comment>

<comment>Warren is like Ted Kennedy Somebody hide her car keys!</comment>

<comment>My, what a fresh and edgy bon mot. You clever thing.</comment>

<comment>Warren might be an excellent presidential candidate 4-8 years from now. It would be very self-serving of her to blow up her chances of having that by facing Hillary now and an electorate that isn't dying to elect her.</comment>

<comment>She'll be too old. But maybe all the ancients will vote her in.</comment>

<comment>I forgot about the age. She's got the energy of a politician not much older than 50, not somebody who just turned 60.</comment>

<comment>She's want we need right now - a no-apology social democrat. The (R)'s have turned the country so far right with their drama you can't see the east coast anymore. We need a pushback.And Hillary...is owned by Wall-St. More of the same. Tweedle dee or tweedle dum.I think I'll register as a Republican this year and vote for Rand in the primary.</comment>

<comment>But the Atlantic just told me the other day that the country was moving left!</comment>

<comment>If Hillary doesn't win the 2016 election, all eyes will be on Warren.</comment>

<comment>My current theory is that she's going to be on the ticket with Hillary as the Veep.  That way, Warren's protestations of "I'm not running for President" are still true, but she will be a major player in the new Administration and the engine to get the Progressive vote for Hillary, which Hillary currently does not have.  Plus, I think the overwhelming "it" factor of having two women on the ticket will be press-coverage gold.</comment>

<comment>There is no way two women on a ticket has any chance of being elected.  If Clinton wins the nomination she'll pick a strong male running mate, maybe a military man like Wesley Clark.  Republicans should choose second term New Mexico governor Susanna Martinez as the VP candidate.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that's the conventional wisdom.  It was also conventional wisdom a black man would never hold the office of President.  Hillary has to motivate the left to get elected.  She knows Progressives would much rather have Warren run than her, but they will likely vote for her with Warren in the fold.I don't think this is a conventional election year.  The Democrats have recently been burned by playing it safe--note the slaughter in the mid-terms when candidates distanced themselves from Obama.  Nope, I think conventional election thinking is getting thrown out this time.  Go big or go home. One can only hope.</comment>

<comment>Very interesting idea.  It breaks the rules in an important way (like Clinton and Gore both being moderate young Southerners), while still doing old fashioned ticket balancing (at least ideologically).  It would create much needed interest and news in an otherwise ploddingly dull ticket.</comment>

<comment>Yup.  I think it could happen.  If you look at Hillary's announcement video, it's straight from the Warren "the game is rigged" playbook. Plus, Warren has been on every pundit show lately and she wrote a book.  Why is she campaigning so hard if she's not running for something?</comment>

<comment>Right, she has to talk the talk to try to tamp down any restlessness among the base, especially given her fundraising base and personal lifestyle.   Bringing on board someone to her left will help nail down the base for the general while letting her reach out.  Sort of what Romney tried with picking Ryan and Bush with Quayle.</comment>

<comment>Also, Warren NOT bashing Hillary and not undermining her by running against her puts Hillary in Warren's debt.  Whether the Clintons will actually return the favor remains to be seen.</comment>

<comment>It wouldn't surprise me if Warren were the VP candidate on the ticket. IMO, 2 women on the same ticket is literally throwing the election away. It's unfortunate that would still be true in 2015, but reality has always sucked.</comment>

<comment>As I said elsewhere in this thread, go big or go home.  Hillary's POTUS hopes are risky anyway--and playing it safe has not worked for the Dems in 25 years.</comment>

<comment>She and the party would be destroyed in the general election by Wall Street money.  You don't bite the hand that feeds.</comment>

<comment>Probably for the best in these cases.  I'm having visions of Christie telling the UN to go f $@k itself or Biden trying to fondle Merkel at an economic summit.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't be the first time a president got a little handsy with the chancellor</comment>

<comment>Haha...true.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I think Christie screwed the pooch even harder by saying that he'd 'crack down' on states that have legalized weed. It's like he doesn't even want to win, ever.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, but I don't see anything in the article to backing up its premise. The reasons assigned to each potential candidate don't have anything to do with whether or not it is too late to launch a presidential campaign. They are merely repeats of widely accepted weaknesses/baggage.At the end of the article the writer cites the typical reasons a potential candidate can't win...all of the donors/campaign strategists are elsewhere committed, but there is no evidence in the article that either of those things has happened.  Many people _think_ this has occurred, but thinking don't make it so.I want a rewrite...This time get me facts and comments from someone other than potential candidates. Get them on the record, too. No "sources close to the X campaign tell me" quotes.Prove to me that it's too late to run.</comment>

<comment>I'm usually not a big fan of death, but consider what would surely go down if G. Reap decided to take several decades off: we'd have the GOP clown car (a Ford Pinto, hopefully) filled with hundred-year-old clowns. Hillary could lose several more times, becoming more secretive and duplicitous each time. Biden would morph into Herbert the Pervert before our very eyes.And don't get me started on SCOTUS deliberations. Florida could disappear beneath rising sea levels and all we'd get out of Clarence Thomas would be maybe an arched eyebrow.And that's just in the realm of politics. Imagine Madonna, at the turn of the 22nd Century.</comment>

<comment>"President Madonna, our 63rd President now in her second term, continues to push her Ageism addition to the Civil Rights Act through Congress."</comment>

<comment>I laughed way too hard at that.</comment>

<comment>"Most voters haven't even started paying attention to the presidential race, and yet the field could already be locked in.Think this is absurd?"Yep, I do. Prove to me that 2016 is any different from 2012, when everyone raced in "early," or 2008, when everyone raced in "early." It's the same cycle.</comment>

<comment>All Hillary Clinton has is gobs and gobs of money.  If that prevents other Democrats from entering the race, then that's pretty sad.</comment>

<comment>That's not a small thing.But the Democrats have a bigger problem: a really weak bench. Who are the other party leaders who have a chance in hell?</comment>

<comment>False. She also has a lot of talented people already working for her. That means anyone who jumps into the race now will either have to steal people from Team Hillary or be stuck with the leftovers who didn't get hired already.</comment>

<comment>Yup. It's the endgame of the Citizens United decision. Once the billionaires made their pick, nobody else was willing to step up. Moreover, whether Hillary wins or whether the GOP candidate wins, Wall Street keeps an ally in the White House and the economic status quo is maintained. In other words, the wealthy have won the class war. They now own our government lock, stock, and barrel.</comment>

<comment>She's one of the most popular political figures in the nation.</comment>

<comment>thank you so much for new Hosting gia re</comment>

<comment>I am not a fan of Kasich, but when the system is such that an experienced governor gets blocked out of running by someone like Carson, it just highlights for me what's wrong with this system.</comment>

<comment>No one said Republicans were not into self improvement. Carson may be less idiotic than the pizza guy as well. But in the end, when the dust has settled, it will be a white guy left standing.</comment>

<comment>"You know Obamacare is really I think the worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery,"  --Ben Carson.  Ben Carson may be a great neurosurgeon, but he's still an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Can anyone really say that someone like Kasich, were he to announce in November 2015 or a full year ahead of the election, could not win the nomination and the Election a full year later?  No.  Can anyone really say that after conservative SuperPACs spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars attacking Hillary (and her husband and daughter and granddaughter) that someone like Biden or O'Malley could throw his hat into the ring in January '16 and not win the nomination in summer of '16 or the election in November 2016?  No.We have a political divide between voters and media.  David Graham and other members of the punditry and big money donors may sincerely believe that Presidential candidates must declare 18 to 20 months before the Election.  Voters have never been there, at least consistently.  We know media ownership profits from the hysteria as evidenced by this article and the continuous air time given to the recent announcements which followed the continuous air time given to who might announce and who should announce and who appeared to be contemplating announcement.While tens of millions of Americans suffer stagnate or declining wages, we get news about Hillary ordering at a Chipotle's.  While Congressional Republicans continue sabotaging the White House through obstructionism and sham legislation, we get op-eds contemplating if Rubio can overcome his moment of compelling thirst.  While an entire generation continues to struggle under a trillion dollars of student loan debt we get feature articles about Cruz's latest promise to fight an imaginary injustice.  While Georgia and Florida write laws banning state employees from speaking or writing the phrase "climate change" or speaking or writing the phrase "global warming" in any official report or activity we get articles asking is it "too late" over 1Â½ years before an election to say you're going to run.We know you can go from the ridiculous to the sublime.  Where do you go after "sublime?"</comment>

<comment>There is some truth to this. However, you are ignoring the things that take time like lining up donors and building a campaign organization and  getting signatures and such to get on the ballots.I feel confident in saying that January 2016 is too late to win the primary if you don't have those things in place.  The New Hampshire primary is Jan 26. Is this summer too late though? Probably not.</comment>

<comment>Does Vegas have a line out on her yet?</comment>

<comment>She is a heavy favorite in the betting parlors, but Nate Silver says she is a tossup, and I would tend to agree with him at this stage.</comment>

<comment>I think there is the liklihood of over-exposure at this point.This will be her second running, and those don't tend to work out well for the candidates.She's been a Senator, a Sec. of State - and now she is going to take a second shot at the Presidency.  Yes, its all out in the open at this point, but I don't think that the citizens are interested in what she has to offer (as in Brand Hillary, not Rep. or Dem.).I think that you're also going to see a pendulum shift again.  The last three-term I remember was from Reagan to H.W. Bush.What will provide her with some tailwind is the lower oil prices.  Unless we fall into a recession in 2016.  Then all bets are off.</comment>

<comment>Any Dem candidate is very likely to be the next president, simply because the GOP literally has to win basically every "purple" state to get to 270...  The Dems have something like 245-250 electoral votes that they will win if they run a balloon with a smiley face drawn on it.  That is a huge hurdle for the GOP to overcome...  To do so, the GOP either needs to have a really strong a dynamic candidate (don't see one emerging yet) to open up the playing field into the Northeast, or the Dems have to be stupid and shoot themselves in the foot (this is always a distinct possibility).Silver's argument about it being a toss-up only works if you think the election will have "off-year" turnout, but that only happens if the Dems are dumb.  His analysis ignores the rigidity of the map over the past 2+ decades.  The "blue wall" states haven't voted for a GOP president in 20 years, and demographics have only pushed that advantage stronger.  The Dems have lost the national popular vote once in that period (to a post-911 wartime President, who subsequently sullied the GOP brand to the extent that even the GOP loathes him), so its not like they are weak nationally either.  Absent a 3rd party or something else making the race screwy, in a straight 1-vs.-1 race, the Dems have a huge advantage.  CO, the "winning" state in 2012 went the Dems by almost 5%.The race is not a lock at by any stretch (I'd put it at 70-30 given the Dems propensity for idiocy), but if you think Clinton will be the Dem nominee, its probably a relatively safe bet that she is also the next President.</comment>

<comment>For all the talk about the large Republican field, they appear to have only 3 plausible candidates, all with serious flaws: Bush, Walker and Rubio. Perry perhaps, but what we saw of him last time suggests he is not going anywhere.Initially I thought Bush was crazy to run given the sorry record of his family running things. Its like they are recession and war magnets. But now, it does look like he could wiin the nomination at least.</comment>

<comment>The constant barrage of self-affirming media pieces declaring "Hillary is clearly the only candidate running for the Democratic Nomination" while simultaneously somehow finding time to write about even the most long-shot flavor-of-the-week Conservative is becoming extremely tiresome.</comment>

<comment>I don't think either Christie or Kasich are long shots in the sense that they aren't qualified or hold extreme views.  If either of those guys ran last time, they might have got the nomination.  Heck, they might have won.</comment>

<comment>I'm enjoying the discussion, very little sarcasm and name calling. A robust primary debate on the D side would be beneficial to Hillary, however it could also damage her and no other D could defeat the R's - period. First female, Bill's soldiers, Obama soldiers, immigration on her side, most women on her side, African American's and most Latinos on her side. She's safer with town halls</comment>

<comment>Basically any Dem is likely to beat the GOP in the general election given the map advantages the Dems have in the electoral college.  It is not a lock, but absent a REALLY strong moderate GOP candidate that can open up the Northeast, or a completely blundering and idiotic Dem campaign (more likely without the vetting of a primary, but anyone beating Hillary will be vetted), its gonna be a tough road for the GOP in the general election. But its unlikely any Dem can beat Hillary in the primary...  she has too much money, and the Dem bench is too weak to really challenge her.  I hope someone does (particularly a more populist lefty to get those ideas in the debate, even though I think most are impractical), and if they do I think they will make it interesting...  but HRC is still likely to win.</comment>

<comment>The Democratic Primary in 2016 will be a contest for potential vice presidential running mates.  Same goes for the near impossible presidential aspirations of Ted Cruz (too crazy), Chris Christie (too fat) and Marco Rubio (too dumb).  None of these guys have the slightest shot at either the nomination or beating Hillary, but are likely picks to be JEB Bush's Dan Quail.</comment>

<comment>I think that it may be getting too late for Kasich.   That Republican field is getting pretty crowded and it won't be last cycle's clown show.  Christie already has the name recognition and most primary voters know his views.  He could announce later if someone slips.As for Biden, it's too late unless something happens with Hillary.  But it's been too late for him for years unless something happens to Hillary.  The person who needed to step up was Warren.  There was a window that may now be closed now.  If Hillary drops out, or is damaged by some big revelation, then field is wide open.</comment>

<comment>Where's Perot? Given the current field, I'd say he actually has a serious shot at winning this one. </comment>

<comment>It may be the Party that loses the election will be the lucky one,  as the Democrats were lucky to lose in 1928, thus escaping blame for the Great Depression which began with the crash of 1929.The multi trillion dollar "financial easing"--the benign sounding name for the biggest raid by private interests of the public treasury in the history of civilization--has, for awhile, inflated the stock market to unreal heights. During the next stock market crisis (always inevitable under capitalism), when these speculative trillions evaporate,  the working class will be presented with the bill as usual. To save the banks, there will be savage austerities and cut backs in spending for food stamps, disability benefits and Social Security, etc. And all this will be blamed by the public on the Party in power. </comment>

<comment>Biden's run out of time. Christie's run out of luck.  And Kasich still has a chance.</comment>
