<comment>Will they declare war on ISIS? Why bother - it's easier to piss yourself and demagogue on TV everyday.</comment>

<comment>So what do you call it when Obama is petulantly forced off the golf course for a few minutes to condemn an ISIS beheading, promises to "degrade and destroy" them - and a year and a half later, has accomplished nothing with his "65-member coalition".(does anybody know if the European principalities of Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Monaco and Andorraare "fighting" in this coalition?)</comment>

<comment>You are an idiot.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>You undersell ol' Spudsie.  He is no ordinary idiot.  He is the biggest, densest, and least self-aware idiot on the whole site.  A very special idiot.</comment>

<comment>Spudwhisperer is a little like that in his own way.  He is a lot meaner and maybe a little less nuanced, but also enjoyable.  You can't get him to admit he's an idiot, but he lets you make it pretty obvious.</comment>

<comment>They all play golf, moron.  The point is that congress doesn't do its job, even between golf games.If Republicans so hate it whenever Obama does anything, why don't they try passing some legislation?</comment>

<comment>The legislature is not the commander-in-chief, son.As Harry Truman said 'The buck stops here'.</comment>

<comment>Only Congress can declare war.  Only Congress can authorize spending money.  Read the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Read a newspaper once in a while, Spanky. Congress hasn't declared war in 70 years.</comment>

<comment>Your damned straight there, little buddy. Here is my super-duper Republican three point plan for dealing with the ISIS threat:1) Reinstate prayer in public schools2) Privatize Social Security3) Bomb, invade and occupy Iran.</comment>

<comment>There's a couple of good, primary sources for information on what's happening with Operation Inherent Resolve. The DoD has a website (http://www.defense.gov/News/Sp....On the declassified map the DoD wrote:If you're disinclined to believe our defense department because you think our troops are liars, you could read this very concise brief from the conservative (Tory) government of the UK: (http://researchbriefings.parli....One other thing to note is that in the media coverage in the US is (unsurprisingly) US-centric and does little to sort out the legal issues involved. For a good digest on the issues of international law, here's a different report from the UK Government:http://researchbriefings.parli...The long and short of it is that all activities being used in collective defense of the state of Iraq are acceptable because the state of Iraq has invited the coalition partners into the fight.  What's a bit more murky (although perhaps less so with Resolution 2249) is can the coalition intervene in Syria to destroy Daesh.Legal justifications do matter, to wit the coalition partners declared Iraq was in material breach of Security Council Resolution 687 and that justified the use of force in Iraq in 2003. (more detail: https://www.usnwc.edu/getattac... and the invasion of Afghanistan, which had very strong backing in Resolution  1368. </comment>

<comment>"...If you're disinclined to believe our defense department because you think our troops are liars...".That's where I stopped reading.  What kind of an azzwipe would try to equate doubting a DoD bureaucrat with "thinking our troops are liars"?</comment>

<comment>Keep reading or stay stupid.</comment>

<comment>Keep living up to your self-describing name, dick.</comment>

<comment>Your anonymity should not be confused with superiority.Don't brag about "stopped reading" when you're communicating with readers.It makes you look rather stooopid.</comment>

<comment>First off, I'm curious about your sources. I'm always interested in reading analysis that paints different picture of the progress being made in Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR).Second, I'm not sure I follow your comment.  Which DoD bureaucrat are you doubting?I guess the SecDef is technically a DoD bureaucrat, but the others delivering sworn testimony in congressional hearings on OIR include senior officers in the US military (or more simply, "our troops).Perhaps I'm being uncharacteristically dyspeptic, I apologize if you feel that I was "trolling" you.  I would genuinely like to see/read the other content that challenges the DoD assessments.   That said, it bothers me that people think that statements such as these:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant’s (ISIL) frontlines in much of northern and central Iraq have been pushed back since August 2014. ISIL can no longer operate freely in roughly 25 to 30 percent of populated areas of Iraqi territory where it once could.(US Defense Department, http://www.defense.gov/News/Sp... )... are the work of some "lone political operative." Governments generally don't operate like the script of Scandal.  That assessment is the result of work from numerous individuals (which includes our troops) that gathered, collated and analyzed intel about the effect collation airstrikes.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't listen even when you use all capitals.  Talking to him is like banging your head against a stone wall of stupid.  Better to ridicule him from a distance.</comment>

<comment>The fact that this issue gets very little coverage by journalists in general is a particularly vivid sign of how decadent our polity is.</comment>

<comment>I think it speaks more to the complexity of the issue and the disinterest of journalists in yet another ground war in Asia Minor.  They don't want to explain the seven or eight factions in the region to their readers/viewers, and even big hair talking heads have the intelligence to look at the Syrian quagmire and say, "Nope, nope, nope"</comment>

<comment>Why on earth do we care?I mean the terrorist aspect is an issue that we should be addressing.But if we can't handle terrorism after all this time and money and effort, we kind of deserve what we get for not learning the right lessons.As for 'boots on the ground'? Why. What possible good could we do in a civil war among mainly Islamic countries.We need to simply let these countries sort it out themselves. Our presence doesn't stabilize anything... in fact just the reverse.On the flip side the rest of the world shouldn't be accepting hundreds of thousands of refugees. If these people don't like the way their country is heading, they need to stay and fight for the country they want to see.</comment>

<comment>Troops in Iraq and Syria could work due to the peculiar nature of ISIL, but it would take ~500,000 troops and overthrowing the governments of both Iraq and Syria (to prevent a return of the conditions that caused the multiple insurgencies in the first place).In short, the whole idea is a non-starter and the best option at this point is to get out of the region militarily and help Jordan and Lebanon with the refugee crisis.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The current 'canonical' estimate for the number of troops needed to engage in the kind of security and stability operations need to defeat a counterinsurgency are somewhere in the 10-20:1 range, so given current ISIL estimates, it would take half a million.  Because of how the declaration of the caliphate works, it requires ISIL to hold ground and administer it, so if the ground could be taken away and held from them, that would be enough to knock them over.  Unfortunately, the main thing propping up the ability of ISIL to generate replacements are the governments of Iraq and Syria's treatment of Sunnis in the region.It can be done, but everyone would have to work together and it would require somewhere around half a trillion dollars to pull it off, but since that is never going to happen, we are better off pulling out completely than performing half measures.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Thank you - excellent post.  What I can't understand is why Obama is not making this argument explicitly to the American people, as I think he shares your opinion.  I believe it would be a popular view if it was sold well.I can't for the life of me understand how Obama got roped into all this nonsense when it clearly was his priority to get out of the region completely.  His policy in the area went from clear (get out) to muddy (red lines and air strikes) to contradictory (special forces and trainers in Iraq) in no time.</comment>

<comment>14 years ago, George W. took the U.S. military into Afghanistan under the guise of destroying Islamic radicals - did that operation succeed? Apparently not ... 50 years ago LBJ escalated in Vietnam to stop "communist expansion." The invasion only invigorated Ho Chi Minh's insurgency and in the end, North Vietnam was victorious. Personally I would rather see the U.S./Mexican Border militarized and all immigration to the U.S. shut down ...</comment>

<comment>I agree, except that arming the Kurds and providing some help would have been a good and cost-effective idea.Better to ally with motivated and disciplined allies like the Kurds, rather than unmotivated and undisciplined "allies" like the Iraqis and the Afghans.</comment>

<comment>Arming or doing anything with the Kurds is just as much a waste of time as anything else we are doing in Iraq and Syria.  Turkey is the monkey in the wrench there and they would never tolerate any Kurdish autonomy.  We would end up having to backstab the Kurds, but they would have weapons and training already, lol.Another terrorist group courtesy of US incompetence.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>The United States did not arm the Kurds, it prevented other groups (Iran, Russia) from arming them, at the behest of Turkey.</comment>

<comment>Obama's excuse was that it had to deal with the Iraqi government, not the Kurds- since the Kurds are not a state. Obviously, the Iraqi government is not going to agree to that- even to fight ISIS.</comment>

<comment>Yo Spud.  We operate a base as guests of the Turks.Not everyone can behave like Republicans and still have friends.</comment>

<comment>Either go in without restraints, or get the eff out. Arming "rebels" and cautiously bombing from time to time are ineffective strategies. Make a commitment to destroy these savages at all costs, or focus on reinforcing the border at home. PC war is not war.</comment>

<comment>You take point.</comment>

<comment>Most of the simpletons in the House and the Senate want to completely avoid putting their fingerprints on any legislation that authorizes Pres. Obama to take action in the Middle East and Central Asia. As long as the administration actions appear to be constrained/restrained by the limits of the War Powers Act, members of congress can look the other way, question Obama's strategy (which they don't even know), and pretend to fulfill the opinion-polled wishes of their constituents--no more war! Pres. Obama has a strategy, developed by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but will not present it to any Representative or Senator because he/she would immediately hold a press conference and divulge it to the world. Then McCain, Graham, and company could vehemently oppose it--even if it was word-for-word their stated "strategy."</comment>

<comment>It's easier to blame him for doing nothing when they haven't authorized him to do anything, with the bonus of getting to call him a dictator when he exceeds his authority.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans might decide to declare some kind of war on ISIL, but who will support them in another war?If Qatar and Saudi Arabia fund ISIL, how can the U.S. continue to call them friends?</comment>

<comment>Congress hasn't wanted to do anything President Obama has suggested yet! If he wants it they certainly don't. However, if it has anything to do with the military industrial complex I'm surprised they haven't jumped on board before now. Usually they can't give them enough money. Let's just cut programs that help the American people instead that's a far better option!</comment>

<comment>Round up those snotty nose kids from the suburbs of Wash DCSend them 2 Syria this time .....their parents benefit most from WAR</comment>

<comment>My take on it was that the R's were running down the clock until they got either HRC or whatever brand of crazy the R primaries produce.  Both of these are much more willing to engage in the sort of broad, 'forever war' the defense companies are hoping for.  Obama wants a much more limited war.  Whats the point of that? Of course, this is starting to backfire as by the time the elections end, Putin may have zorched ISIS out of existence.  Along with a few Turk 'freedom fighters'.  Maybe we can go spread freedom to the Congo instead.</comment>

<comment>But that's literally 13 months and change away from inauguration! 11 months from official lame-duck-itude. A year of indolence... well, why am I even aggravated. It's not like they've done sh*t for the last six-plus years.</comment>

<comment>In this case, I am really quite happy with not doing sh*t.  We don't have a dog on this track.  This track is covered in broken glass and venomous snakes.  Lets keep our dogs well away from this track.</comment>

<comment>"...But even if some are serious about a renewed discussion, it’s likely Congress would get bogged down by the same obstacles it’s faced before: not only because it’s divided over the particulars of the president’s authority, but because members don’t seem willing to act on their constitutional obligations."...</comment>

<comment>I'm more concerned about domestic terrorism by right-wing crazies, but congress can't do anything about them because Republicans don't want to upset their base.</comment>

<comment>It's pretty easy for accomplished idiots like Graham to act tough, but sit them down, and soon they get exposed. Just ask "THEN WHAT ? " to every proposal they make. Yey, destroy Daesh . Then what ? Saudis will simply fund "the next" Daesh. Then what ? What do you do with the Syrian territory ? Occupy it forever ? Hand it back to Assad ? Proclaim an independent Kurdistan ? The US don't have a partner to talk to ,in Syria. No wonder, since Syria is a long time ally to Iran and Russia. It's THEIR mess. The Iraqi Kurds won't move too deep into Syria, because the "Syrian" Kurds, the PKK , are already there. The PKK is the only group who is really bringing it to Daesh, and both Turkey bombs the crap out of them, and the US dubs them "terrorists". If Graham wasn't a phoney, he would be advocating to crush the Saudis and the Pakistanis, who are double dealing with the US for decades. The only thing that makes his "strategy" making any sense, is following who pays for his senate races.</comment>

<comment>The politics of 2015 are too extreme for something like a bi-partisan declaration of war.  The Democrats don't want to do it because declaring war on middle eastern terrorists reminds them too much of President Bush.  The Republicans don't want to do it because they don't want to support anything President Obama does, even if they actually agree with it.  Both sides don't want to take any accountability by putting their name on a vote like that.  After all, look at the witch hunts that have gone on for anyone who voted in favor of Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Remember back in 2002, when Dubya announced his new "National Security Strategy" ? It proclamed that the US had a right to wage war on any percieved threat, at will. Kissinger dubbed it "antecipatory self-defense", and predicted it would "shread the fabric of international law". I mean, Kissinger ! Not the dovish guy you can find. And Iraq was the perfect subject to establish the new international norm of "war at will". That's why there was no post-war plannning. The war in itself was the goal. Neocons are so miopic , and still get to run their mouths everywhere, even in this forum. But i've got an antidote , actually, borrowing one Obama zinger : "THEN WHAT? ". Neocons are all about short-term goals, and quaterly reports. But China, Iran, Russia, all of them are chess players, and play the long game.</comment>

<comment>Which just goes to prove that the majority of the masses get stupider everyday.</comment>

<comment>He requires an AUMF and a boatload of money to make a nice neocon war.We can't afford it and still have enough to shut down the government for PP.Our President is not to be taunted by adolescent tantrum throwers.You need to go lay down by your dish.</comment>

<comment>For the love of God, no more Mideast wars. How many more trillions of dollars do Republicans want to waste on wars in Asia? How many more thousands of troops must die so defense contractors like Halliburton and Blackwater can rake in profits?Republicans have learned nothing, NOTHING! from the past 15 years of military intervention in Asia.</comment>

<comment>Amendments XVI (Income Tax) and XVII (Direct Election of Senators) were enrolled by lawless PROGS a century ago, without the bother of state ratification.  The Senate has been illegitimate since then; as has the tax code.  I pay taxes under duress, but intend to rectify this lawlessness, so help me God.  The loss of Reserve Currency Status, and the continuing economic collapse: MAY provide an opportunity to restore the constitutional rule of law.  Until Obama, the Presidency was legitimate.  Now the House of Representatives is the SOLE constitutional institution in the failed national government.  And the House is not much to write home about.So no more foreign military adventures, until the homefront is secured.</comment>

<comment>Gerrymandering makes the House of Representatives a human institution. Both parties gerrymander boundaries to the absolute limit and beyond.  They always have, and always will.</comment>

<comment>please stop encouraging him, he's obviously ill.</comment>

<comment>There is still profit in war, but the citizens and soldiers do not profit.  So for example, LIbya had a Strategic Gold Reserve; which is gone now.I assume that US Politicians made off with most of the gold.  ISIS and a few Libyans likely spirited the rest of the Gold Away.   So somebody made money; but it was NOT the USA Taxpayer.</comment>

<comment>The people in the Bataclan theater were listening to a Satanic band and singing songs in praise of Satan.Even if ISIS killed them, which they didn't, who cares.</comment>

<comment>ISIS has called itself a nation. To declare war on them would legitimize their claim. Is this the real goal. Legitimize ISIS?How about we end the BS war on terror and attack lawless behavior, starting with our own.</comment>

<comment>International police offenses need to be dealt with by international police.INDIVIDUALS need to be held to account.War is just not apropos.  It's like delivering a loaf of bread in an 18 wheeler.</comment>

<comment>This simply won't happen because holding people to account is not the goal.If we really wanted to hold people to account for ISIS, starting with their leadership, we would have to start in Washington D.C.. It just won't happen.</comment>

<comment>When 911 came, the whole world was on our side.Then it was escalated into an invasion, massive bombing and declaring all Baathists enemies.And here we are.Think back if Dubya had instead launched a dragnet.In 2015 no one can hide.  Police work does not make unnecessary enemies like Gulags, torture and carpet bombing do.All that bluff and strut got us just what a cocky little rich frat boy would get strutting along the Levant.</comment>

<comment>When 911 came the world was not on our side. Leaders voiced support for out of fear. The vast majority of the people of the world knew then what most Americans still can't accept despite all the evidence. 911 was an inside job. The invasion of Iraq never had anything to do with 911. People were sold a lie and the stupid still believe that lie. The people that know how the US government works knew the lie was coming before it ever took place.see: Project for a New American Century.....</comment>

<comment>No more international military adventures:Until the national borders are secure, the ILLEGAL Alien hordes are repelled and the constitutional rule of law has been restored.So phhuckt Lindsey Graham, Barack Obama, John McCain and their belligerent saber-rattling.</comment>

<comment>You just listed three people in Satan's employ. Do you really think they are ever going to do something in the true interests of this nation and it's people?</comment>

<comment>Well HAAAIIIEEELLL NO.  Pfhhuckt Lindsey Graham, Barack Obama, John McCain and their belligerent gawhdamn saber-rattling. They are stupid as a bucket of rocks.</comment>

<comment>Pfhhuckt them won't accomplish much more than another Satanic orgy. Maybe try an exorcism.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, or sumthin.</comment>

<comment>good luck declaring war on something that members of congress can't define</comment>

<comment>I seriously hope they don't because the US has been involved in more wars than any other country and we've been attacked ONCE on US soil and that was on 9/11 by Saudi Arabia. Why didn't the US bomb Saudi Arabia instead of Iraq or Afghanistan? We literally spend billions of dollars funding two senseless unneeded wars that have accomplished nothing while we ignore our own domestic problems like our national debt and security along the border, Bush started it all and Obozo is making it worse by reaching out to these terrorists countries, we've had two wars already and we certainly can't afford to have another, the US has no resources or manpower to fund it, enough with the warmongering already!</comment>

<comment>Leaving out:French & Indian, Revolutionary War, 1812, Sioux Uprising, Creek Uprising, ... Pancho Villa-Columbus NM, Pearl Harbor HA, Dutch John AK, German commandos, German Submarine Attacks, Japanese Submarine Attacks, ...Your local community college might have a history class or 2 available ...</comment>

<comment>And thats exactly what Daesh wants: US/western intervention.It will legitamize their claims about 'western imperialism' and give their followers a reason to arm, recruit, and expand their influence even more.It will also lead to increased western antipathy towards refugees, who are also hated by Daesh, drawing many into the arms of the later. These xenophobic feelings will lead to increased sentiment favoring civil rights violations.Over a decade 'nation building' in iraq and afghanistan hasn't worked, so what makes you think a even smaller troop continent being sent against Daesh will work any better? The country that NATO absolutely needs to commit ground troops to, the United States, has no political will for such things.But I dont count on the war hawks from the Republican and Democrat sides learning from their mistakes...ever</comment>

<comment>Well, what the Daesh Islamic Caliphate is GETTING, is a revitalized (LEGITIMATE) Syrian Government thanks to Vladimir Putin.  And he is bombing their OIL EXPORT business to pieces.</comment>

<comment>Open Borders allow the Daesh Islamic Caliphate to export Terror to the West.  Russia  has Banned George Soros and all his minions from their realm. Russia is simultaneously stabilizing the legitimate Syrian Government.  Tight border security and rigid immigration policies and enforcement eliminate MOST of the radical Islamic terrorist threat.  Terrorist attacks from 911 to the recent Paris attacks, are in essence due to importing a KNOWN hazardous substance.Meanwhile Obama, the Soros sock-puppet is begging for his felonious-controller.  http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/...</comment>

<comment>Absolutely not. Few of these fools in office have the guts to take a stand on anything. All are afraid their actions might scare off a few voters. None should be re-elected.</comment>
