<comment>I don't know that tracking the number of prescriptions for the pill is particularly representative of how many women are using contraception. There are better options.The young women I know are taking advantage of hormonal implants, for example.</comment>

<comment>I think Plan B is probably affecting this statistic more than anything.  Unless a minor or young adult wants to get pregnant in bad circumstances (like being a minor), they take Plan B.  I have nieces in that age bracket and know for a fact that at least two of them hove gone that route after a night of poor judgement.  That MTV series "16 and Pregnant" might actually be doing some good.</comment>

<comment>There was actually a study done that showed a high inverse correlation between teen pregnancy rates and that show's viewing ratings.</comment>

<comment>There are those that would get knocked up just to be eligible for the show.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't make it the norm. There are people who have decided to surgically alter their ears after watching Lord of the Rings. That doesn't mean that everyone is doing it.</comment>

<comment>Basing your data on anecdotes and a TV show dosnt say much of anything. Plan B is emergency contraception, and many people take it who don't need to (what if the condom broke? It didn't, but what if!).Do you have any data on the numbers of Plan B sold?</comment>

<comment>I think I'd give approval to the notion. Can't you buy it OTC now? I'd say that makes it a likely candidate for lower abortion rates.</comment>

<comment>Wow, what an angry sounding reply.  I thought this was a discussion. Perhaps you're not familiar with an informal discussion where the participants share anecdotal experience and what they saw on TV or read somewhere.  I wasn't running for office, I was sharing a theory.  For your benefit, I looked up use of the morning after pill.  The article was from 2013, at that time they said 5.8 million had used it since it became over the counter in 2007.  Now mind you this is just my opinion, but I think that 5.8 million could put a dent in the abortion statistic.</comment>

<comment>The figures on contraception usage vary widely from survey to survey. That said, the pill greatly outstrips long-term, impermanent methods in terms of popularity. For example, while IUDs have enjoyed a fivefold increase in popularity over the last decade, they are still only about one-fourth as popular as the pill. Which is to say, the switch from one method to another is not enough to account for changes in popularity of the pill over time. So, tracking prescriptions for the pill might not be entirely accurate, but based on its degree of popularity, it does offer a good representation of the number of women using contraception, generally speaking.</comment>

<comment>That's mission of good gynecological care though -- abortion will always be necessary for a variety of reasons, but the mission is to ensure that women have healthy reproductive systems with appropriate birth control choice access.</comment>

<comment>The birth rate dropped during this period, too. Fewer women are getting pregnant to begin with.  </comment>

<comment>Yes. And the rate of violent crime in the USA has also dropped dramatically since the early 1990s: http://www.vox.com/2015/2/13/8...The thing common to both violent crime and unwanted pregancy is: impulse control. Americans in their peak reproduction years (roughly corresponding to their peak violent-crime years) have been exercising better impulse control since the early 1990s.And the leading theory for why the violent-crime rate has dropped is: the elimination of lead in gasoline. Lead's effects on the brain include degradation of impulse control. And In both the USA and internationally, whenever a country—or locality—has eliminated lead in gasoline, a sustained drop in violent crime has followed.Impulse control. Lead.Further reading: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pm...http://www.motherjones.com/env...</comment>

<comment>Can we blame lead for Iraq?Secondly impulse control seems to be the wrong word.</comment>

<comment>(1) Iraq: no. Unfortunately the US invasion of Iraq was not impulsive, but instead was the result of an organized, planned, sustained effort to deceive the American and world public about what US intelligence showed.(2) Wrong word: (a) "Impulse control" is two words. (b) Google "lead impulse control" and see if you still think they're the wrong words.</comment>

<comment>1) seems impulsive. We didn't have a plan for the aftermath, and no one bothered to ask before we went in.2) Phrase then. Lead affects socio-patheic behaviour more than just impulses. That's why I said impulse was the wrong word.</comment>

<comment>Well George W wasn't a deep thinker and felt no need to plan for the aftermath. He probably believed Dick Cheney's "we'll be hailed as liberators" cover for his own Haliburton, et seq. interests making lots of money in the aftermath.</comment>

<comment>Violent crime in many arge U.S. cities is on the rise again, not surprisingly. As long as there is a 72% black illegitimacy rate and a 53% latino illegitimacy rate and 24% white illegitimacy rate, there will be a permanent ill-educated, underemployed class of citizens that live in poverty and deprivation, with a good number of those males engaged in criminal activities all their life.If this nation was serious about poverty reduction, instead of importing millions more illiterate poor from other nations, there would be low cost and widely available family planning clinics that handed out free birth control. Instead, we still and forever have a nation that hews to the antediluvian whims of foreign theocrats, along with the layers of both government and commerce that are enriched off poor women ruining their life by over breeding because males in their life will not use a condom and because a government check is still cheaper than the only reliable birth control: an expensive and doctor-required IUD. Every female has the right to control her body and her life, just as much as any male does. Abortion ought be safe, widely available and also low cost, as it is in most industrialized nations not controlled by the Vatican, Islam and evangelicals. Abortion will always exist, as humans are imperfect creatures, but it remains the result of others failures that can be ameliorated but never are in the oppressive, inhumane desire of some to punish poor young women for having sex or to force factory farm young females into producing congregants, armies and low wage labor.</comment>

<comment>I'm in sympathy with your views, but suggest you look deeper.The common factor beneath the recent uptick in violent crime (still at much lower levels than in the 1990s) and the rise over the last 50 years in out-of-wedlock birth is: unemployment, underemployment, and declining middle-class disposable income.The last 50 years: middle-class wages have remained essentially flat (adjusted for inflation) while the costs of medical care, health insurance, housing, and college have risen far in excess of general inflation. Result: decline in real middle-class living standards; increasingly difficult for the poor to escape poverty.Since 2008: job creation has been sustained at a relatively OK pace the last several years, but we STILL have not created enough jobs to make up for population growth since 2008—i.e., we still have more people out of work than pre-recession. Great chart depicting this: http://www.epi.org/blog/at-an-..."U6," the labor dept's measure of unemployment that includes some (not even all) who've given up looking, and those working part-time but looking for full-time work, is still over 10%.And the job fields that have taken the greatest hit since 2008 have been male-dominated.And men commit an overwhelming majority of crimes.Bottom line: when men have a harder time making a wage good enough to support a family, they are more likely to commit crimes, and less likely to look like marriage material to a prospective mate.(People commit doggone few crimes while they're at work. Unless they work on Wall Street.)Another Atlantic writer, Ta-Nehisi Coates, notes the decline of the African-American family is exactly what Moynihan predicted 50 years ago, if the government didn't ensure there were enough decent jobs at decent wages for black men. The government didn't do it, and Moynihan's warning proved spot-on. And then the same economic pressures on the family spread from African-Americans to Americans of all ethnicities.Coates: "There's no real political cost to telling people to get married. (Everyone loves a wedding.) Telling them that there should be a jobs program that makes more men marriage-material is different." http://www.theatlantic.com/nat...</comment>

<comment>Yay!News about what millennials think!</comment>

<comment>"A large share of Americans don’t feel comfortable describing themselves as either pro-life or pro-choice, or feel that both labels might describe them in some way."Of course we feel this way.   The politics are so polarized by over the top rhetoric and hard-line attitudes that ignore both the human and medical realities of any pregancy on both sides (although most stridently on the anti-abortion side), that you have to be an idiot to fully align with either the pro-life or pro-choice positions.   Abortion is a difficult legal and human problem, and yet the debate about it has been drained of all nuance and compassion by advocates on both sides.Personally, I would not want anyone in my family to get an abortion for non-therapeutic purposes, and I'd go to considerable expense and personal investment in order to make it possible for a daughter or son's significant other or a grandchild to avoid one, but I don't claim any moral right to prevent them doing so, and I certainly don't want the freakin' government deciding in advance that they must carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, or making it emotionally or physically more difficult to obtain an abortion that medical necessity dictates.</comment>

<comment>Ah yes. The tired "both sides are guilty" argument.</comment>

<comment>Except that it's not an argument in this case, it's an observation made in the statement I quoted, and which is born out in survey data.  For most Americans, both sides are wrong.  We don't want abortion on demand justified by the notion that there is only one person involved at any stage in pregnancy, and we don't want the government prohibiting abortions outright.   And those are the positions the two poles stake out.</comment>

<comment>You're deliberately mischaracterizing the pro-choice position. No one is calling for abortion on demand.</comment>

<comment>I am, but I would characterize myself as mildly pro-abortion (beyond just pro-choice). There are too many homo sapiens on this planet.</comment>

<comment>Which is why we have birth control. I don't believe in abortion as a form of birth control.</comment>

<comment>I believe abortion as a form of birth control is far more humane and reasonable than war, poverty, starvation, and pestilence as a check on population growth.</comment>

<comment>So do you get to decide who'll be aborted?</comment>

<comment>I realize I'm troll-like, but c'mon.</comment>

<comment>I don't believe the choices 3.5 billion women make are any of my business or yours.</comment>

<comment>Where did I say I thought they were my business?</comment>

<comment>Yup, a pro-abortion position like China would be "the other extreme". Pro-choice folk fall in the middle, leaving it up to the individual and their doctor.</comment>

<comment>I am.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm not, and yes they are.I'm a long term supporter of Planned Parenthood who believes that abortion should be "safe, available, and rare."   But I here the more strident voices on the "choice" side as well, and I disagree with them.   More to the point, I'm in a comfortable majority of Americans who do so.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Actually, most invasive medical procedures are not available on demand.   You can get an appointment with a primary care physician, ED care, and many cosmetic procedures at your command, but beyond that there are plenty of hoops, starting with  medical necessity for most people to have a medical procedure performed on them.But that's beside the point.   The majority of Americans do not see abortion as "just another medical procedure," just as most Americans do not see at least early term abortions as "murder."   So you've nicely illustrated the point the article was making.As for me, I was pretty clear, I do not want the government prohibiting access to abortion.   I certainly said nothing to suggest women seeking abortions are "heartless baby killing sluts."   That is the anit-abortion rights' position, and precisely what I and most Americans reject on that side of the discussion.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I am not arguing any of the things you say I am, and the fact that you have concluded on no evidence that I am proves only that you'd rather mischaracterize people whose views are not as strident or clear cut as yours than engage them.Which is to say, there's a reason a majority of Americans dislike the strident pro-choice as well as the strident pro-life positions.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>"You are trying to make the point that all of these hoops that women have to jump through is a good thing, since people have to jump through hoops for various other invasive procedures."Here is what I wrote in my original comment: "I certainly don't want the freakin' government deciding in advance that they must carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, or making it emotionally or physically more difficult to obtain an abortion that medical necessity dictates."From that you got that I support the restrictions in the most extreme anti-abortion states.    Either you're illiterate or disengenuous.   You choose."People do *not* have to jump through hoops for other medical procedures, though."For a lot of reasons, I don't think other medical procedures are particularly relevant to this discussion, but if they are, you're still seriously wrong about this.   With the exception of cosmetic procedures, you cannot get an invasive procedure performed on demand in most cases - you have to have convince a doctor - and in many cases an insurer - that it's medically necessary and appropriate.   If you think otherwise, I invite you to march into the hospital I'm sitting in right now and demand one.   Then we can count the hoops you go through before you get it.The irony here is that I actually support abortion rights politically and with my charitable donations - I'm a strong support of Planned Parenthood.   But I am one of those majority of Americans who do so in a nuanced middle ground - because abortions do raise ethical issues for me personally, just as does prohibiting them.    And, you're hardly increasing my support for the cause by leaping to conclusions and misrepresenting my position simply because - as the article and I pointed out, like most Americans - I am somewhat ambivalent about the issue.</comment>

<comment>You win.   I'm now convinced that I'm an anti-abortion, anti-woman zealot.   I'll be cancelling my Planned Parenthood donations and probably my Democratic Party ones as well, since I'm obviously sending them to the right place.   She's probably beyond retrieval at this point, but I'll also do my best over the July 4th holiday to convince my daughter that I taught her all wrong about women's empowerment and choice and responsibility too.Congratulations on your victory, but also a suggestion for the future: when you go to convince someone you don't know of the rightness of your cause, don't start by pigeon-holing them in the worst possible light (from your point of view) based on their not using the right words, or holding a position quite as clear and un-nuanced as yours.</comment>

<comment>Trying walking into a hospital and demanding "on demand plastic surgery"</comment>

<comment>When it comes to this issue,  as with so many issues, the most die hard proponents on either side are certainly guilty of trying to reduce the issue to a facile debate.Most people can simultaneously grok the idea that a woman has a right to decide what to do with her body and the idea that humanity doesn't necessarily begin at the moment of birth.The most vocal advocates demand that we ignore one of these ideas.</comment>

<comment>"Most people can simultaneously grok the idea that a woman has a right to decide what to do with her body and the idea that humanity doesn't necessarily begin at the moment of birth."I've yet to meet a pro-choice person who thinks that human begins only at birth. No one is saying that an hour before birth, the thing inside a woman isn't yet human. But we're not talking aborting children an hour before birth.</comment>

<comment>Because few women choose to, unless it's a medical neccessity? Canada just north of the border has no restrictions on abortion at all. The whole late-term debate is just a red-herring appeal to emotion.</comment>

<comment>Or, other side of the coin, that a person must have an abortion. Remember that part of the original pro-choice argument was that women were being forced to have abortions by their families/social pressure. It would seem a good thing for all sides that abortions are down.</comment>

<comment>People kind of forget that used to be the other side of the coin, and still is in some countries. The pro-choice movement was a deliberate reaction to that.</comment>

<comment>My perception is that outside of the group of pro-choice activists, no person who considers themselves to be a feminist appreciates the dictate of abortion on demand as a litmus test for recognition as a feminist. Venomous rhetoric is usually appalling to any thoughtful person; particularly one who recognizes that a decision to have an abortion is monumentally complex. With greater availability of more effective birth control measures (than say in the year of Roe v. Wade), perhaps there are fewer cases of the use of abortion as a form of birth control.</comment>

<comment>Monumentally complex decisions should not have simple laws (banning abortions after such and such date) based on simplistic reasoning (it's icky).</comment>

<comment>The dates are based on when doctors believe that a fetus is viable outside of the mother. That's the legal point that the Supreme Court has decided that a woman can not have an abortion afterwards. A decision mind you that was given in Roe v. Wade. Hardly simplistic reasoning or because "it's icky."http://www.politifact.com/virg...</comment>

<comment>That's incorrect. See my comment above.</comment>

<comment>The question before SCOTUS has never been whether a woman can have an abortion at a particular time.  Roe v. Wade and its companion case of Doe v. Bolton involved identification of the point at which a state's interest in preserving fetal life becomes weighty enough to override a pregnant woman's privacy and personal autonomy interests in deciding for herself whether to carry a pregnancy to term.No state is required to prohibit post-viability abortions.</comment>

<comment>of course, simple laws based on simplistic reasoning are nothing but problematic. but if memory serves me correctly, the trimester by trimester analysis of Roe v. Wade  was hardly offering simplistic reasoning, much less reasoning that referenced the word icky. in the 4o years since, the age of viability of the fetus outside the womb, although depending on extraordinary measures and often with life long problems, has expanded. No surprise that certain state legislatures have sought to push restrictions to the max.  I think it would be a fallacy to dismiss such efforts as either simplistic or inconsistent with Roe v. Wade however. That these efforts are politically motivated in order to address religious beliefs no more renders them invalid than the countering lobbying for abortion on demand.</comment>

<comment>What Roe does is institute a test - after viability the state can take the interests of both the fetus and the woman into account, while prior to that it can only take that of the woman (obviously). This does not mean abortions can be banned after viability, as the interests of the women are still present, though many conservative legislatures have attempted to do exactly that.</comment>

<comment>" I would not want anyone in my family to get an abortion for non-therapeutic purposes"Why?  What do you care?</comment>

<comment>My exact thought, although I can agree that it would suck to have to unexpectedly drop several hundred dollars on getting oneself out of a situation one does not want to be in. But that applies to other situations like flat tires and twisted ankles, too, so.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, at the most I might be like "well that sucks for you to have to bother with all that" but would I try to talk them out of it?  No, why should I?</comment>

<comment>Truth. Not like I'm going to talk anyone out of a flat tire, aside from "Uh maybe try to avoid that pothole up there."</comment>

<comment>You shouldn't, if you feel about the situation as you describe.   The point of the quote from the article and my post is that most of us in the middle of the debate don't feel that way.   Until the anti-choice and pro-choice hardliners understand that most of us neither believe that an early term abortion is the same as infanticide (murder, in other words), nor that an unwanted pregnancy is just another inconvenience (MT's flat tire reference in the next response), they'll keep on shouting at each other, and miss the majority in the middle.</comment>

<comment>Well, obviously I care that anyone I care about not find or put themselves into a situation where they feel the need for a abortion - I would not wish an unwanted pregnancy on anyone, and certainly not those I care about.Beyond that, I've known many women who have had abortions.   The vast majority found it at least moderately stressful if not outright traumatic at the time, and most carry regrets throughout their life.   That doesn't mean abortion wasn't the right answer for them, but my general sense is that the downstream consequences of abortion are not minor.Of course, neither are the downstream consequences of an unwanted child, or of releasing one's child to adoption, so I'm not saying I'd try to block someone close to me from aborting an unwanted pregnancy -  it's a woman's choice, at least when done early in pregnancy.   But, as I said, I'd go to considerable personal expense to make it possible for them not to - by mitigating the cost and risk of keeping or releasing to adoption an unwanted child.</comment>

<comment>Meh, that could be said for any argument. Gay marriage? Iraq WMDs in 2003? NSA surveillance? je sui Charlie?There is a natural human tendency to seek a middle-position when they see two other people debating. It's comfortable and happy. But what really matters is not the positioning in the argument, but how the policy affects them.</comment>

<comment>Under the most common biological definition of life, an embryo at about 1-2 weeks out validly qualifies as life. And since the embryo has the DNA make up of a distinct human, it makes it a human life. Killing a living human is murder so...Further, "child" as defined by Merriam-Webster says this, "1 a   :  an unborn or recently born person." Also, "4 a :  a son or daughter of human parents."</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>First, apparently you didn't read the definitions I quoted. One included the word "person" the other used the more explicit word, "human." Second, your hypothetical is just off base. The rapist is attacking you. Further, did you just equate an unborn baby to a rapist? You're kind of a twisted person.Last, definitions completely matter. If you are unwilling to define your words, your arguments are meaningless. Otherwise, you could define the words to mean whatever you wish and argue that your opinions are 100% correct. Three really means four, so two plus two equals three. It's ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Where do you get the idea that killing a living human is necessarily murder?  A killing may be unintentional or accidental, which may be a grade of homicide less than murder.  It may be justifiable, as in the case of a self-defense killing, and thus no crime at all.Murder requires a culpable mental state of some kind.  At common law, murder required the killing, with malice aforethought, of a reasonable creature in being.  A fetus did not qualify as a reasonable creature in being.Sir Edward Coke observed that there must be, lst. Sound mind and memory in the agent. By this is understood there must be a will, and legal discretion. 2. An actual killing, but it is not necessary that it should be caused by direct violence; it is sufficient if the acts done apparently endanger. life, and eventually fatal The party killed must have been a reasonable being, alive and in the king's peace. To constitute a birth, so as to make the killing of a child murder, the whole body must be detached from that of the mother; but if it has come wholly forth, but is still connected by the umbilical chord, such killing will be murder. Foeticide would not be such a killing; he must have been in rerum natura.Don't bandy around inflammatory words without knowing what they mean.</comment>

<comment>"Justifiable homicide" actually means a homicide committed to protect innocents.  Since an unborn baby is innocent, this would not be legally, morally, or ethically, or in any other sense of the phrase a justifiable homicide.Just a homicide.The rage is just seething beneath your words though.And it exposes abortion for what it truly is: maniacal and homicidal.For people whose 'god' is convenience, the way to appease the 'god' of convenience is to remove any and all barriers to it.  Even at the expense of human life,Aztecs threw their babies into the fire to appease their gods. Americans throw theirs into the trash.We are no less barbaric, just cloak our barbarism under a guise of civility, give it smooth sounding words like 'inconvenient' or '.entitlement', or 'clinics' or 'doctor'.</comment>

<comment>This is good news for everyone who isn't personally invested in the abortion wars.Is it new abortion restrictions? No. Abortion rates are down even in liberal states. (They are only up in states neighboring those that have recently enacted new restrictions.) Are more pregnancies being carried to term? No, the birth rate is down as well.There is some evidence that better contraception may be responsible for the decline. Even so, adoption of long-acting reversable contraceptive (LARC) methods, such as IUDs, remains low, and there's a reason the morning after pill isn't called "Plan A".I suspect that people are better informed about sex, contraception, and pregnancy because of the internet. There is a lot of information that is easily available that wasn't there 20 years ago. You can find online what might not have been taught in a sex ed class.</comment>

<comment>Anytime someone describes themselves as pro-life, I always ask if they think capital punishment should be legal. If they say yes, then I know they're not pro-life. We should call these people what they are, which is anti-choice.What's funny about conservatives is that they want to ban abortion, but they also want to make it harder for women to obtain contraception. You'd think they'd support contraception since it prevents pregnancy and therefore eliminates the need for an abortion. So why are conservatives opposed to contraception as well? Simple. This is all about shaming women for having recreational sex. How dare you have sex for something other than procreation.The shaming of women goes beyond sex. Why do conservatives oppose equal pay laws? Because they want to drive women out of the workforce. If you think you're going to be paid less than your male colleagues for the same job, then that'll discourage you from wanting the job. Why do conservatives oppose things like paid maternity leave or universal pre-K? Because they want women to choose between being mothers and having jobs. If you want a job AND be a mother, we won't make it easy for you. And then we'll make you feel like you're a bad mother for wanting to work.This is the part where conservatives will chime in to say that war on women isn't real, that it's just something the "liberal" media made up. But it's very real as I just illustrated. It all adds up to a clear pattern. Drive women back into the kitchen and out of the workplace. Make sure those women only have sex to create babies.</comment>

<comment>The elites don't care about social issues. Give em their tax cuts and cut regulations and they'll be happy.</comment>

<comment>Please don't construct straw men. The argument against contraception is not about shaming women. It's more about "shaming" everyone that has recreational sex. Men shouldn't be using contraception either. Disagree with their arguments, but don't mischaracterize them. The rest of your post is just biased feminist talking points the are really just irrelevant to the topic of discussion.</comment>

<comment>I was told to "keep it in my pants." Since you said never, this anecdotal nullifies your first argument. As for your fact, is it a fact? While going through school I had the fortune (in this context) to have to take sex education twice due to switching school districts. One of those classes was abstinence only, and your fact was not factual to that class.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>First, you took an anecdotal account and then applied it to all instances. A single teacher saying something like that does not equal all abstinence education. Nor does it necessarily imply that the abstinence education calls for such an argument. Second, given the quotation provided, I think you've misconstrued the argument. But I don't see enough information to adequately make such a determination. That said, given what was provided, "abstinence only education compared girls who have sex to used gum," is false. It didn't specify girls. It only said, sex is like chewing gum. The person (who was a female) referred to herself as chewed up gum. To be fair though, "nothing is said about boys who have sex," is true; but for the same reasons I just mentioned.As for the part about shaming women and not men. You said, "...men are never told..." I am a man, I was told, therefore your statement is false. I know other men who have been told that as well. Further, you've already referenced abstinence only education. Education that is given to both boys and girls. "Keep it in your pants" is basically a crude way to say be abstinent, which is what aforementioned education is saying.</comment>

<comment>Ah yes. The strawman defense. When someone has perfectly stated your argument, accuse them of constructing a strawman rather than admit that what they said is accurate. It IS about shaming women. Notice how men are never shamed. If a man gets a vasectomy, you don't see conservatives trying to block it or make it not covered by insurance. But if a woman wants a pill, they make her pay for it. The message is clear. Men can have sex for fun, but women can't.</comment>

<comment>You need to stop projecting your bias. You've identified broad categories of people and are applying specific definitions to them to suit your argument.</comment>

<comment>Nice try. Come back when you can actually refute any of the points I made. Show me where conservatives are shaming men for having sex.</comment>

<comment>Agree, also in many religions sects in this country a women is obligated to submit to her husbands sexual needs. Therefore , giving her NO control over her family planning.</comment>

<comment>The righties long for the day when women had no rights.</comment>

<comment>They probably don't answer because you're unable to give respectable responses. You're trying to gotcha them into responses using convoluted logic.</comment>

<comment>It's a simple scenario. You seem.unable to address it.</comment>

<comment>I can address it, but the reward of giving a thoughtful and meaningful response is so low. Volkisch has already explained that any response of "yes" to his hypothetical makes the person a "sick f***k."</comment>

<comment>What do you think?</comment>

<comment>On?</comment>

<comment>Thank you, I'm glad you agree I'm right.</comment>

<comment>As I suspected. You have no proof.</comment>

<comment>Burden of proof is on you. You made the claims.</comment>

<comment>Nope. You're the who claimed it's about shaming everyone, men and women. Show us proof that men are being shamed.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me, you haven't provided citations for your claims. I have no impetus to provide opposing proof until you have evidence to support your claims."So why are conservatives opposed to contraception as well? Simple. This is all about shaming women for having recreational sex. How dare you have sex for something other than procreation."Citation please.But I'll do you a favor. Condoms are not permitted for use by the Catholic Church.</comment>

<comment>Nice try. One doesn't need citations to draw a conclusion from the actions of others. Next you'll be asking me to prove that water is wet or that the Earth is round. Tell me why you righties oppose contraception for women but have no problem with men getting vasectomies.</comment>

<comment>Oh, so then you should believe what I said, as my conclusions are also drawn from the actions of others. Therefore, I have no need for proof.</comment>

<comment>Except that you haven't said what those actions are. Show me the actions that show men have been shamed. Isn't it funny how you didn't challenge to prove anything until after I called you out on your BS. LOL. Nice deflection tactic. Standard right-winger who knows he's been cornered.</comment>

<comment>You're the one claiming a thing has happened. BDN is saying a thing hasn't happened. As it is not possible to prove a negative, the burden of evidence is on you, the person arguing a thing has happened. If you cannot provide verifiable evidence that the thing has happened, then you lose.</comment>

<comment>"This is all about shaming women for having recreational sex."That is the claim at the heart of this thread of discussion. It was made by BigNoseDog in the comment that I first responded to. I provided a counter-claim to theirs. The onus is on them to provide "verifiable evidence" for their claim then.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps that is a part of this conversation, which it's my feeling BDN has provided substantial evidence to support his claim (causes for claims named and and thorough explanations for the conclusion drawn) . You, in an attempt to refute BDN's claims, stated that men are shamed as well, and yet aside from "I was told to keep it in my pants," you've provided no support for your claim (you are not the many, and being told to keep it in your pants is hardly equivalent to living in a culture in which your contributions are not viewed as equal on the basis of your gender).I'd also like to remind you that no one has ever questioned whether men should have access to erectile dysfunction medications, despite there being no medical need for such medications, and no one ever questions whether these medications should be covered by insurance. This suggests that we live in a culture in which men are not only allowed to have whatever sex they like, but ENCOURAGED to do so even when biology is trying to shut them down.</comment>

<comment>What links has BDN provided? What references to news articles, group manifestos, etc have they provided? None. As for you quotation of mine. You need to look at who I was responding to. That was not meant as anything to this thread. Someone said that men are never told that. I was. Therefore it's not never. To ask me to provide proof for that personal anecdote would tell me that it's impossible to prove anything to you. People don't record everything that is said to them or that they say.As for the second point that you raise. We do not live in an homogenous society. Our culture is not monolithic. There are people of varying dispositions to varying topics. You can not assign all decisions of society as a whole to the power of subsection of society. This is in effect the straw man that I was initially talking about.</comment>

<comment>BDN hasn't claimed any results of studies. He has made assertions about the reasons for conservative behaviors. You've claimed he's wrong but without any logical reasoning for it aside from "I don't think so.""You can not assign all decisions of society as a whole to the power of subsection of society. This is in effect the straw man that I was initially talking about."It isn't a straw man: you're claiming that conservatives treat recreational sex from all persons, regardless of gender, as equally wrong, and yet no conservative politician I've ever heard of has ever suggested that Viagra shouldn't be available or at least, that it shouldn't be covered by insurance. If your claim that it's recreational sex that's the crux of this issue, and not *women* having recreational sex, then how do you explain the treatment erectile dysfuction medications?</comment>

<comment>I understand the argument for pro-choice and i support people right to defend an unborn child even though i my self am pro-choice. Howerever, recreational sex is not illegal. If its against your religion you are free to exercise your right to not par take. Separation of church and state- please leave your religion out of my family planning.  But your religious believes cannot determine what others do. Contraception should be readily available for anyone who wants to use it to avoid an unwanted pregnancy and prevent the need for abortions.</comment>

<comment>What exactly are you arguing against?</comment>

<comment>The "argument against contraception."</comment>

<comment>Quoting the relevant section."The argument against contraception is not about shaming women. It's more about "shaming" everyone that has recreational sex. Men shouldn't be using contraception either. Disagree with their arguments, but don't mischaracterize them."Was such an argument made to be argued against?</comment>

<comment>Yes, that what was what Carol was arguing against.</comment>

<comment>The point of capital punishment is killing the guilty. A baby is created in the womb at conception after intercourse. That baby is there through no fault of his/her own and is therefore innocent. That is why capital punishment and abortion are different. The criminal had a choice. The baby has none.You believe pro-life is the wrong term for people who support capital punishment but do not support abortion. That goes both ways. Why isn't the term pro-choice pro abortion? Do you find hypocrisy in a pro-choice individual who does not believe in capital punishment?http://www.catholic.com/radio/...</comment>

<comment>I support abortion rights.  I also support accurate use of language.Pregnancy can under some circumstances be forced, such as where pregnancy results from forced sex.  More commonly, however, pregnancy is the (sometime) natural, unforced consequence of sexual intercourse.In the absence of interruption, by force or otherwise, that pregnancy will proceed to term and result in a birth.  A surgical abortion is the unnatural termination of a pregnancy that otherwise would proceed to term.The phrase, "forced pregnancy" should be reserved for pregnancy resulting from force.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I never suggested that the abortion decision should be made by anyone other than the pregnant woman.  Who, though, is "forcing" any sentient, autonomous woman to remain pregnant?A pregnancy resulting from consensual sex is a consensual pregnancy which, until at least the point of viability, the consensually pregnant woman has every right to terminate.And preventing someone from leaving a body of water is false imprisonment, and thus force, in a manner that a pregnancy proceeding naturally to term is not.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>A pregnancy not resulting from force is an unforced pregnancy.Tautology rocks!!Those of us who support abortion rights should not use stilted language (e.g., "reproductive rights" or "reproductive freedom") to euphemize abortion.  The right to abort (or not) should not be the constitutional right that dare not speak its name, to paraphrase Lord Alfred Douglas.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I understand all of that, and of course the pregnant woman does and should have the right to choose what to do about the pregnancy.And my reading comprehension is just fine, thank you very much.  I have been a criminal defense lawyer (and a good one) for 27+ years.  Force and non-force cannot be conflated -- they are antonyms, for Heaven's sake!  Force requires power or compulsion directed toward an end, usually in a manner sufficient to overcome resistance.  A pregnancy proceeds to term in the absence of force.  Indeed, a surgical abortion itself involves the application of force to the pregnant woman.</comment>

<comment>I suspect that you are a devotee of Humpty Dumpty's words of wisdom in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking Glass:I wonder, though.

<comment>Capital punishment is the taking of a life. Whether the person you're putting to death is guilty of a crime is irrelevant. You're still killing someone. Therefore, you can't claim to be pro-life. Second, pro-choice isn't the same as pro-abortion. I support a woman's right to choose. That doesn't mean I think she should choose abortion. She can give the child up for adoption or raise it herself. Hence the reason it's called choice. So no, I don't see the hypocrisy in a pro-choice individual who opposed the death penalty. Unlike you, I actually value life.</comment>

<comment>"Capital punishment is the taking of a life. Whether the person you're putting to death is guilty of a crime is irrelevant. You're still killing someone. Therefore, you can't claim to be pro-life." So, if a person comes into my house while my family is sleeping, and when I confront him he says he's going to kill my family so I kill him first I would have to give up my pro-life card because as you say, "whether the person is guilty of a crime is irrelevant, you're still killing someone"?</comment>

<comment>Nice try. But there's a big difference between killing someone to save your life or the life of someone else and killing someone to punish them for a crime. If I kill an intruder, that's a form of self-preservation. I'm killing him because I want to keep him from killing me. But explain how putting a criminal to death preserves your life. It doesn't. You can throw the person in prison and you'd be just as safe.</comment>

<comment>I agree that there are different moral choices for killing given a particular situation. Putting a criminal to death may or may not preserve my life. For example, I think the killing of Osama Bin Laden may have saved lives because he could have been planning another terrorist attack. I see what you are saying in cases of individuals who have nothing to do with me on death row but again, these are choices you make for the particular situation. My main point is, in saying you are pro-choice, you agree that a woman should have the legal right to eliminate her child. You may hope that she goes through with the pregnancy, goes through the pregnancy with the intention to give it up for adoption etc. but you are still okay with keeping abortions legal if that's what she decided to do.   The pro-life position is supporting the life of the unborn, all the unborn should have a legal right to life and abortions should be against the law.</comment>

<comment>If the people who call themselves pro-life really cared about the lives of the unborn, then you'd expect their concern to extend to newborns as well. But the majority of these people don't seem to care about the kids once their out of the womb. That's why I call BS on their claiming to be pro-life.</comment>

<comment>Go to Catholic Charities; Get Help; Our Services. Adoption, Child Development, After School Car, Adolescent Parenting, Counseling, Child Welfare Programs: http://www.catholiccharities.n... There are tons of resources. Also, the average waiting list for an adoption is two years and the average cost is around $50,000. And most of all I just don't see why a one month old is any different then a baby just out of the womb except for the fact that the former is a less developed human life.</comment>

<comment>I agree with every scenario you put fourth but they don't have anything to do with abortion. Where do children come from? Do the mother and the father, who had sexual intercourse, have a responsibility to the baby they created? They knew the possibility for the creation of life was there since no form of contraception is 100% effective?If I invited you onto my yacht and said "come aboard, I'll feed you and offer you shelter, just come have drinks with me and enjoy the scenery. Then, once were at sea I decide, I don't like you, for whatever reason, so I decide to throw you off the boat. Am I responsible for your death? Of course I am because I invited you onto the boat in the same way a coupling invites the possibility for creating life.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry, there is little to no rational thought coming from Volkisch, just endless circular arguments ('a fetus has no right to other people's bodies'? who utters this crap out loud? it is utter nonsense).

<comment>Yes, yes, you would.A parallel: during the Vietnam war, one test of whether someone was truly a conscientious objector was whether they were willing to raise arms in the defense of their squadmates and themselves.  If they would, they could not be considered a CO, because someone who was truly a CO would refuse to raise arms in any situation.</comment>

<comment>I don't think they value fetal life. I don't think they value life period. Remember, these are the same people who want to arm everyone so they can shoot each other. These are the people who don't care if people can't afford to access health care and end up dying. These are the same people who want to send more troops to die in Iraq. These are the same people who pretend climate change isn't real, even though it'll eventually make Earth uninhabitable for humans. The anti-abortion movement is all about punishing women for having sex. If you get pregnant and the pregnancy could kill you, tough luck. Don't get pregnant next time. That's the conservative mindset.</comment>

<comment>sorry, we don't need to go to your personal website in order to "rate" abortion, whatever that even means.</comment>

<comment>Spam</comment>

<comment>I had hoped that it was because of increased use of and more effective contraceptives. Any kind of operation, even a common appendectomy, is risky. Much better to use contraceptives to prevent pregnancy in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Most abortions aren't surgical.</comment>

<comment>It's still a medical procedure, not without risk to the patient.</comment>

<comment>Generally speaking, when one is discussing medicine and one refers to an "operation," one is referring to surgery."Medical procedure" is literally any treatment that happens under medical care, including when I get the extra wax watergunned out of my ears.Accuracy in terminology is important. Abortions are, generally, medical procedures, but they are not, generally, operations.</comment>

<comment>It's amazing the lengths some people will go to to evade acknowledging that an abortion is a risky procedure to the woman it is performed on. lol.</comment>

<comment>I never said it was 100% risk free. I said it wasn't always surgery. That's literally all I've said.</comment>

<comment>Abortion is not completely risk free, but it is much less risky than carrying to term and giving birth.</comment>

<comment>It has nothing to do with protestors or legislation (abortions are down even in liberal states.)I'd guess most of it has to do with availability of the Plan B pill. Even the poorest person can generally scrape together $40. Since this drug is sold over-the-counter, its usage won't be reflected in prescription statistics.</comment>

<comment>interesting, they said in the article sales of birth control have not really uncreased i wonder if they included this. Also do they consider implants an IDUs as the "pill" in there stat? Food for thought. Also sex education and sexual empowerment of younger women might mean more condoms are being used.</comment>

<comment>That was clearly a reference to hormonal birth control, not plan B, based on the fact that they referred to it as "the most popular form of birth control".</comment>

<comment>That's cute.   I am a woman.</comment>

<comment>And?  That's called collusion.</comment>

<comment>Because surely (gasp) I couldn't be thinking for myself on this issue.(Did you just use your own argument against yourself?)</comment>

<comment>How very nonsensical.  You can be a woman and still collude with misogyny and think that 'you're thinking for yourself'.</comment>

<comment>Oh - so because I disagree with you on abortion, I only "think I'm thinking for myself".   An interesting feminist ideology you have.Btw, 'collusion' means to band together with others to secretly deceive.  Exactly how is being pro-life 'collusion' given the actual definition?  There is nothing illegal about being pro-life and nothing deceptive about it.In fact, it could be argued that pro-choice is the deceiver of the two positions, since it masks the clear evidence of science (that life begins at conception) with doublespeak and subterfuge (clump of cells) to try to convince women that there's nothing wrong with abortion.I choose...to be pro-life.   You sound like you were all about a woman's right to choose?  I've made my choice.</comment>

<comment>Welp, when your original posts presumes that 'women finally figured out it's murder' you're presenting an argument that women don't think too good.Collusion is: "Thinking and acting in ways that support a system of oppresion" (Hardiman & Jackson, 1997).You have the right to be pro-life and the right to be a misogynist.  But you're not free from the responsibilities of your word choice.</comment>

<comment>Yea...Hardiman and Jackson are not Webster. Theirs is not a commonly accepted definition of 'collusion' and in fact it could be called a theoretical definition.I never presented nor insinuated an argument that women don't think good. After all, I'm a woman, so such an argument would be self-defeating.What I said was 'women have finally realized it's murder?" and put a question mark at the end, implying that one possible reason for the decline in abortions was that women came to a new truth or new realization.Coming to  a new truth or new realization does not imply that the person was previously unintelligent, it simply means that a person is not omniscient.We all discover new truths all the time.  For example, given the science people had previously, the smartest persons of an earlier era would have opted to have their blood let to ride themselves of diseases.   This practice went on for years.Very smart people partook in it.However, when new truth presented themselves (indicating bloodletting wasn't a good idea and there were better ways of treating disease), the practice stopped.  This doesn't mean that the persons engaging in it were unintelligent, just not omniscient or fully informed or even misinformed.   Same goes for abortion.</comment>

<comment>Just not much of one.</comment>

<comment>Internalized misogyny is such a trip.</comment>

<comment>I know, right?Because surely no thinking woman would freely choose to be on the pro-life side of this debate.Sigh.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say you weren't thinking. I said you have internalized misogyny.</comment>

<comment>Funny, I don't feel misogynistic.   Or think misogynistically. Or think that I think misogynistically.Tell me, is telling other people how they feel misogynistic?  Or just pompous?</comment>

<comment>You want to strip other women of the right to do with their bodies as they please. That is misogynistic, whether you believe it is or not.Misogyny is not a feeling, least of all internalized misogyny.</comment>

<comment>Oh.   I see. "Misogyny is a state of being."  You informing me that misogyny is my 'state of being'  is somehow less pompous?I want to strip no one of any rights.Where we beg to differ is on the point that infanticide is or is not a 'right'.Even supposing your idea that it is:   What about the right of the woman in the womb?  Does she have a right to do with her body as she pleases?</comment>

<comment>I told you I'm not responding to your tripe.</comment>

<comment>Or, with widely available and more effective birth control, they can avoid getting pregnant until they are ready to parent. Which is more likely?</comment>

<comment>Then why has the birth rate been going down even as the abortion rate has dropped?</comment>

<comment>Do you know what "murder" means? Because, while I'm not particularly interested in debating whether or not abortion is "wrong," it's certainly not "murder."</comment>

<comment>Well.   Let's see.  I'm going to take a long suction vaccum tube-like machine into your home.  Through your front door.When I see you, I am going to grab your limbs one at a time and pull.  And pull.  And pull. And keep pulling until literally your limbs detach from your body.   One at a time.  In the old days, this was used on criminals.  Called being drawn and quartered.  First your arm will come off.   Just a little blood.  Then the other arm. Whoa, that's a lot of blood. Then your legs.Then my machine will snap your spine.  Crack.Lastly, your skull will be crushed.Then, I will neatly remove all these body parts using said suction machine.At which point will I have murdered you?Because this is the process used in your typical abortion. </comment>

<comment>When I'm dead. You still don't seem to know what "murder" means. Here's a hint (that probably won't be all that helpful, I'm guessing.) Murder is a legal term.</comment>

<comment>Clearly then, women who seek out medical help and get an abortion should be locked away for life to punish them and discourage others.Am I right?</comment>

<comment>No it is because fewer women are having unwanted pregnancies. Abortion is not murder.</comment>

<comment>We can agree to disagree.</comment>

<comment>A lawful abortion and a murder are mutually exclusive, doofus.</comment>

<comment>We can agree to disagree.</comment>

<comment>The late Daniel Patrick Moynihan cogently observed that everyone is entitles to his own opinion, but not to his own facts.If one of us contends, and the other disputes, that red and green are different colors, would it be appropriate then to "agree to disagree" on that point?Murder is by definition unlawful.  A lawful abortion is not.</comment>

<comment>The fact that women are taking another human life.  That is, killing.  Killing a pretty good reason for not wanting other people to abort babies.It is called homicide, and it is already illegal.   For some reason though (in a frenzy that would appeal to the Egyptian demon-goddess Ishtar) our civil laws have convinced themselves to sidestep natural law for the most vulnerable persons - infants- simply because they happen to have the misfortune of being inside someone's womb as they grow.Somehow, entire sectors of society have convinced themselves that homicide in this case is perfectly acceptable.An unjust law is no law at all however and  abortion 'rights' form such an unjust law; one not in keeping with natural law, the good of society, or protection of human beings.</comment>

<comment>Ah, now we're getting down to brass tacks.One has the right to one's own body. One is not under any circumstance required by law to submit their body to allow another to live. If my brother needs a new liver to survive, I am under no obligation to give it to him. Not even if I only have to give him part of my liver. Not even if it means he'll die. Even if I'm already dead, I'm under no obligation to let others use my body to continue their lives. It is something that we do not require of anyone, ever.So why should we demand that any woman submit her body to support the life of a fetus if she doesn't want to?And why is it that the so-called pro-life movement puts so much effort into trying to ban abortion when there are much, much more effective ways to lower abortion rates?And why oh why do anti-choice advocates always use the false flag of "homicide"? Homicide is a legal term and it does not apply to legal abortion. You're trying to drum up emotions on the topic because you can't argue it otherwise."Natural law," what a laugh. Abortion has existed forever. Literally forever. There is no part of human history in which women were not ending pregnancies they didn't want or couldn't handle... and in cases where they didn't, atrocious things happened to the resulting children.Stop wringing your hands over the poor aborted fetuses that never had any consciousness. Worry more about the millions of children who live in poverty. Worry more about the millions of children in the foster care system. Worry more about the young women who end up forced into motherhood when they're ill prepared and unsupported.  If it bums you out that abortion exists, fine, but don't try to worm that personal opinion into the laws of our nation, because it's terrible for us as a nation.</comment>

<comment>Does the baby have a right to his/her own body?   If so, what choice would he or she make if given the opportunity?You are assuming - falsely - as most pro-choice persons do - that there is only one 'body' involved.  There are two. Separate dna and all.</comment>

<comment>Whether a fetus has a right to it's own body is not at issue: it cannot survive without infringing on the body of another. Like my brother who needs a liver (in this fictional though possible analogy), he is not legally entitled to my liver, even if it means he'll die. My brother has his own body, but that doesn't give him the legal right to mine under any circumstances whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>Whether a fetus has a right to its own body is PRECISELY the issue at hand.How people can take a bond between mother and child, (and he entire institution of childhood really) the bond of life without which NONE of us would survive, and attempt to make it sound parasitic, rather than humane, natural, and normal. is beyond me.Further, a newborn baby cannot survive without infringing on the body of another either.Are you suggesting that babies already outside the womb should therefore similarly be 'disposed' of if they inconvenience the parents?What about two year olds?Pretty sure they can't make it on their own either.  Pretty needy. Need the 'bodies' of parents to help tie their shoes, fix lunch, wipe their bottoms, help them get dressed.Childhood, by definition, is dependent (upon adulthood)!The child-adult relationship is by definition different from a relationship between two adults or siblings, as in the fictional case you posit.Evidently these things need to be explained nowdays?People don't even know the difference between childhood and adulthood.It takes a special kind of barbarism and years of American cultural media brainwashing to equate childhood and the mother and child bond to something parasitic.God have mercy.</comment>

<comment>A newborn does need help, but it needs the help of anyone. It's mother, it's father, a grandparent, a stranger-- it needs someone. Not a particular someone. A fetus, in the other hand, is not transferable. It is impacting that one person, and no one else (directly) for as long as it takes.If you don't understand how an unwanted pregnancy could be parasitic, you really have no business in this conversation. Pregnancy is by definition parasitic, and while many people welcome it, not all do. And I believe those people deserve a say in what happens in their own bodies. You want to strip those people of their feelings, of their right to self determination, of their autonomy, because they just might make a person, and apparently that's the very most important thing in the universe to you. It isn't to me. And since we are still talking about what the law should be, your ~*~feelings~*~ about what human life is worth are irrelevant. </comment>

<comment>The most I can do I this point is pray for you.  The worldview you paint here is quite nihilistic.It doesn't seem you care about human life at all (except perhaps your own, which is a unique kind of narcissism, but even then you barely sound concerned).The posts drips with ennui.You even indicate that you acknowledge the life in the womb is a human life (although many pro-choicers, even on this page, do not), but still don't care about taking that life.A certain level of soul-deadening is required for this.It seems you certainly would not care if someone elses life was taken. Maybe you would care if it was your own, barely.  I'm not sure how one gets up in the morning with this worldview?You also seem to believe that your view - human life doesn't matter - should trump my view - human life matters very much.   But without a strong ethical case for support.As for feeling ~feelings~ have little to do in the matter.  The ~ facts~, however, the fact of the value and dignity of every human life, matters very much.When you have sex, you are engaging in an act that is potentially life-giving. Period.  You engage in the act, you engage in the consequences.  The baby didn't ask to be in the womb.  Two adults choose to come together.This is partly why sex is sacred and not cheap, and not just something to do to for entertainment.</comment>

<comment>"It doesn't seem you care about human life at all"On the contrary, I feel very strongly about the lives of sentient people."You also seem to believe that your view - human life doesn't matter - should trump my view - human life matters very much."Do you even hear yourself? My beliefs would impact your life NOT ONE IOTA. I don't want to strip you of any rights at all. Your beliefs, however, impact every single woman in the nation."When you have sex, you are engaging in an act that is potentially life-giving. Period. You engage in the act, you engage in the consequences. The baby didn't ask to be in the womb. Two adults choose to come together."Finally! Damn those slutty sluts having sex without intending to procreate.Y'all always come down to shaming people for having sex without wanting to procreate. Wanna put an exception in there for rape, just so we know it's not really about fetuses and entirely 100% about telling people for what purpose they're allowed to have sex?</comment>

<comment>Please show me the definitive research that says that babies in their earliest stages of development are not 'sentient' or cannot feel pain?Look, I didn't create biology.  It is the way it is.  You can rail against it all you want, call it names, pout, whine, but it will still be biology. A man and a woman having intercourse typically leads to babies.  That is, after all, how each of us got here.That's the birds and the bees.  I'm sorry you don't like it.  I'm sorry the bare bones facts of biology gives you such fits.I said nothing about 'sluttiness', or any such thing.  That is your word, your add-on, your lens, your view, your preconceived idea being added to the discussion and superimposed into the discussion.I'm talking straight up biology.I'm sorry you take biology so hard.I'm sorry you think that 'biology' or 'two people having sex is an act that can lead to a baby' means somehow  a coded language for saying 'somebody somewhere is telling you what to do'?I'm sorry you think 'having sex can lead to babies' is a shorthand way of someone telling you 'you are slutty' rather than simply a factual statement that describes the way nature operates.This seems to have to do more with the voices in your head than anything I've said.As for the impact of abortion:  your views do impact me.  The loss of every baby impacts me.  That baby could have been the next Mozart, the next Martin Luther King, the next Michelle Obama.  Think of the impact these people have had on others.That baby could have been my friend, my neighbor.  By allowing babies to be aborted, one is depriving the human race of the impact and legacy of potential impact of these persons offer.Either every life matters.And I have yet to see any peer-reviewed research proclaiming that a baby in utero is incapable of feeling pain.  Based off the science we know so far (and it could change with ever-expanding developments) babies are indeed very capable of feeling pain from their earliest stages.As for 'depriving' you or anyone of the 'right' to abortion:1.  It is not a right.  It is a misguided construct.2. Abortion 'laws' are in conflict with pre-existing laws against homicide.3. Abortion 'laws' are every bit as anomalous and unjust and reprehensible  as Jim Crow 'laws' were in the South.  "An unjust law is no law at all" - mlk. Abortion 'laws' deprive unborn person of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness and are therefore unjust.  They are in conflict with pre-existing homicide laws making them illegitimate.I'm sorry it would inconvenience you and thousands of other woman to not be able to kill children anymore, however, natural law, common sense, justice, decency, and morality dictate that 'legalized homicide' is not a good basis for a society.A grown woman inconvenienced (and barely: you could always give the baby up for adoption?) and a human being killed (a fate you resign an innocent baby to) are two dramatically morally different things.My time is through.I'm sure you can agree.</comment>

<comment>Praying for you Volkisch.  If I had to guess, I would say you are suffering from narcissistic personality disorder or are somewhere on the sociopathy spectrum.The fact that you feel the need to continually attempt to engage in this discussion with someone who has indicated she does not wish to engage you shows that you are also afflicted by some level of ocd and stalking tendencies.You have my prayers.However, because you have finally *attempted* to engage in civil discourse using actual data this time (copying and pasting it) rather than simply just spewing endless ad hominem and circular nonsense means that you have finally earned my attention!Congratulations buttercup!  That is a win.Unfortunately........oh Volkisch.......you poor thing...I regret to inform you...That the data you posted does not say what you think that it says.In fact in one document the long quote that you claim it contains (ncbi.nlm paper) does not even exist.  So this is an outright fabrication.The other documents say things like:- "although current studies cannot provide direct evidence of fetal consciousness...they do suggest the required neural processing architecture may be in place and functional" (Merker, 2007).-"like Merker, I believe that consciousness may not be contingent on the particular anatomy of the cerebral cortex" (Edelman)-"small scale ...studies of human fetuses have found that thalamocortical fibers begin to form between 23 to 30 weeks gestational age, BUT these studies did NOT specifically examine the pathways ACTIVE IN PAIN PERCEPTION.So your data, (the parts that are not outright red herrings, or have nothing to do with the abortion debate)....your data......dear one......is in no way definitive, or conclusive, nor does it itself claim to be definitive or conclusive.   It claims that more research needs to be done on very early fetal development.In fact while the authors can and do note for certain that consciousness and pain responses are measurable at 18 weeks and beyond, these same authors of the articles YOU produced themselves acknowledge that all is NOT YET KNOWN about early fetal consciousness and pain.Keep trying precious Volkisch.  You will need to keep scouring the internet.Work very hard at this.Stay up late at night.Invest much time.Cyberstalk.Throw out red herrings and ad hominem and circular reasoning to people with whom you disagree.You will not find definitive data that says fetus' for certain do not feel pain, because such definitive data does not exist.My last post on this page.  God bless you Voikisch.   Praying for you sweetie!Hail Mary full of grace, the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb Jesus.  Holy Mary Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.</comment>

<comment>You are creating a false dichotomy.   Who says I am not also simultaneously worried about and doing things for children in poverty?It is not one or the other: either you care about the poor or you are pro-life.   One can be both: concerned about the poor and about the unborn.I happen to be entirely against abortion AND do a lot, every day, to deal with poverty and children (by profession).</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying you're not, I was referring to pro-life people in general. The lobby claims that their goal is to save children, yet puts all of it's efforts into abolishing abortion, rather than any effort at all into the things PROVEN to lower the incidence of abortion. Aligning yourself with a movement that is so boldly twofaced brings your own motives into question... and, to bring things full circle, betrays you as a misogynist, regardless of what else you may do with your time.</comment>

<comment>What are things 'proven' to lower the incidence of abortion from your perspective?Also, again, one can align with a 'movement' for one reason and one reason only while still aligning with other movements to deal with the *contextual* issues.Again, you are making this much too black and white and evidently seeing the pro-life cause through a very narrow lens.Far from being misogynistic, I could be said to be so pro-choice that I'm pro-life.  That is, I believe so much in "choice" that I believe even the fetus should have a choice.The decision does not involve merely a woman and man, but a woman, man, and baby, and each one of those persons should have a 'choice'.Unfettered choice is an illusion.  Each of us, by law, makes choices in suspension with the rights of others.  In a sane society, choices are checked by the rights of others.As a woman, what I do not support is unfettered 'choice' for women (so-called choice that says I can do whatever I want).   I support choice that respects the lives of others.This is called sanity (and is part of living on planet earth within the human family), not misogyny.</comment>

<comment>If you don't like the term 'homicide', we can simply stick with murder, killing, infanticide and the like.Any word you use, it is still the taking of a human life.The logic that says 'abortion has always existed therefore it is okay' is specious and convoluted.Murder has always existed since the beginning of known civilization, you are correct.  That does not make it right.Jim crow laws existed in this country for a time too.  That did not make them right.   Which is why an appeal to natural law is necessary - to rule out unjust civil laws.</comment>

<comment>"murder, killing, infanticide"Only one of those is a technically accurate term, and that is killing. The others are also terms with definitions that do not include legal abortion."The logic that says 'abortion has always existed therefore it is okay' is specious and convoluted."You misread my point. For starters, I didn't say that. What YOU said was that abortion is "not in keeping with natural law," which I pointed out was not accurate. Abortion is totally and 100% in keeping with natural law. That doesn't make it any more morally right or wrong than... i dunno, spitting.You are arguing a point I did not make.</comment>

<comment>How is abortion in keeping with natural law?  (are you certain you know understand what is meant by the term 'natural law'?)</comment>

<comment>In that each human has the right to self determination. If you're referring to anything religious, please note that I am paralyzed with not caring what your religion thinks about anything, at all, least of all what I do with my uterus. And if your suggestion is that modern US law should reflect your religion, then I think we can all agree what the problem is with that.</comment>

<comment>Oh!If THAT's what you mean by natural law, then  I basically agree : "each human has the right to self-determination."  I would couch it more in terms of "conscience".  But still, I get the drift.What about where your self-determination conflicts with my self-determination?  Then what?   Do we need laws to help us decide how two people's self-determination can co-exist or work together?If you say  'yes', you have simply acknowledged the basis of natural law.ie - people should not kill each other just because they disagree, and other fundamentals without which a society cannot exist.Where we truly differ is in who constitutes a human.  And who or what gets to decide.I didn't bring religion in.I am only arguing for the life innocent fetus:  I would say she too, has a right to self-determination.</comment>

<comment>I mean, but the fetus started it. Showed up uninvited and unwelcome and trashed the joint. I get to kick it out.Semi-kidding aside, one has to look at the end result of your suggestion that a fetus' right to self determination should supercede the right of a woman not to be pregnant. The end result is women enslaved to their uterus. Pregnancy going to ruin your life? Career? Education opportunities? Physical health? Mental health? Oh well, too bad. Thanks for playing but you have failed. Your rights to your body have been terminated. And don't forget all the pressure you'll be under to fix your life after your opportunities have been grabbed data from you.Wtf else is a fetus if not human? I always wonder where people get this idea that pro-choice people don't think fetuses are human. They aren't squirrels. The difference is that I think merely being human does not give a being the right to anyone's body who is not willing. You seem to think it's super mega special, but to me, there's more to humanity than being human. </comment>

<comment>You just gave me a great idea Volkisch: I will pray for you.   It is very clear this is why God brought you to this website.  God bless! :) :) :)May the Holy Trinity shine upon you and grant you mercy, grace, and wisdom.May the road rise up to meet you.  May the wind be always at your back.  May God hold you in the palm of His hand.May you find Jesus in the innermost places of your heart.May you find the Holy Spirit surrounding you.May angelic warriors - specifically Saint Michael - help you.Saint Michael the archangel defend us in battle, be our defense against the wickedness and snares of the devil, may God rebuke him, we humbly pray.  And do thou, O prince of the heavenly hosts, by the power of God cast into hell satan and all the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls.And lastly, may the Blessed Mother, Mother of all mothers break the back of the demon of abortion:  Hail Mary full of grace the Lord is with you, blessed are you among wojen and blessed is the fruit of your womb, Jesus.  Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death.  Amen.</comment>

<comment>"Eighty percent of young, white evangelical Protestants and half of young Catholics said abortion should be mostly or completely illegal..."While I currently identify as a non-believer, I was raised Catholic. My experience is that there is huge disconnect between what the Church teaches and what people actually believe and how they live their lives. As this statistic hints, Catholics are nowhere near as crazy as evangelicals, even if there is some trending in that direction.</comment>

<comment>Latino Catholics in the U.S. are beginning to skew that decades-old "what the Church teaches and what people actually believe" theory that held some value prior to the U.S. importing 50 million Mexicans and Central Americans.</comment>

<comment>People should focus on preventing the unplanned pregnancy in the first place, instead of dealing with the results. The effect on the population would be exactly the same, but it would deny an opportunity for people to get their knickers in a twist about something.</comment>

<comment>Your first sentence and a half would make sense, if the last clause of your second sentence wasn't the operative part.</comment>

<comment>What I'm getting at here is that there is a significant portion of people who do not care nearly so much about the cause they claim to embrace as they care for the adrenaline rush of being viscerally indignant about something.</comment>

<comment>No, man, I was agreeing with you!</comment>

<comment>Abortion has been a political issue for 4,000 years of written human history (seriously; it's in the Code of Hammurabi). Apparently the human tolerance for argument knows no bounds.</comment>

<comment>"It's been a male obsession" is the better way to phrase it. All females know this.</comment>

<comment>Given greater access to (more effective) birth control,  more and better sex education, access to social supports, and the collapse, at least among the working class, of the stigma against single motherhood, shouldn't a steady and dramatic decline in abortions be a complete given?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Its not a win win because one side, the anti-abortion side, isn't about abortion per se. Its about controlling women's sexual behavior. That was exposed when Rush made his comments about college women using birth control being sluts.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I don't have time to write an essay, but this dates back decades. Did you follow the whole Hobby lobby and birth control paid through the ACA thing last year? To me it ripped the mask off.Conservatives, especially southern Evangelical conservatives, are stuck in the time warp of the 1950s. They want us living in a patriarchy where dad makes the decisions and mom takes care of dinner and changing the sheets. Abortion is a tool to rally the troops and hold off the progressive tidal wave.Think of it another way. If you follow their logic, then abortion really is murder. And if it is, then women who abort should be doing life or face execution. Have you ever met an anti-abortion protester who actually believes that?Neither have I. That means their agenda is something else entirely.</comment>

<comment>don't have time to write an essay but plenty of time to expel hot air and a viewpoint that is just flat wrong"isn't about abortion per se. Its about controlling women's sexual behavior."  is just flat wrong.  Instead of providing anything of substance you provide a scary bogeyman narrative from Jezebel, nice.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, you guys have left too large a trail of evidence to the contrary.</comment>

<comment>Who are you guys, am I a Southern Evangelical now?</comment>

<comment>How would I know? "You guys" are those attempting to prevent women from exercising their choice over bringing a fetus to term, and at the same time restricting their access to birth control. If the shoe fits, wear it.</comment>

<comment>dude do me a favor next time instead of responding to each and every one of my comments that make up sequential statements within a conversation, just reply to the most recent one and say all you want to say in one comment, thanks.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I don't read jezebel, and read salon with a large grain of salt.I'll repeat my question. Do you know a single anti-abortion person who believes that abortion is "murdering a child?" And if true, do they think the woman who made the decision should be punished as we punish a murderer?Because absent yes to both of those, this is a bullshite issue. They don't believe their own rhetoric, and their argument is really about something else.By the way, if it were not for the southern evangelicals, there would be no abortion issue in the US. Roe vs Wade would have settled the matter.</comment>

<comment>'Do you know a single anti-abortion person who believes that abortion is "murdering a child?" And if true, do they think the woman who made the decision should be punished as we punish a murderer?'Yes of course many (most? all?) pro-lifers believe you are taking the life of a child.  But your wording is a bogus way to frame the conversation - of course not every instance of the taking of human life is viewed equally in the eyes of the criminal justice system or through most moral lenses (manslaughter/murder/etc)</comment>

<comment>Ok then Bob. What should the punishment be?</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't be in favor of starting a conversation in those terms.  I'm not a lawmaker or executioner.  I'd rather address it through support and compassion for those struggling with the experience.  I think it's the right way to go to offer more support programs for single pregnant mothers to be, and to do a better job connecting them with aspiring adoptive parents.  Better incentivize families to adopt and give them support when they adopt, approaches like that.  It's not perfect, but neither is the world we live in.</comment>

<comment>I totally support what you just said. Provide the support for women who want to, or are willing to give birth, and allow women to choose a different path if they think that is best for themselves.So I guess we are both pro choice and pro woman then.</comment>

<comment>Ah! Ah! Ah! not so fast.  I'm pro woman, I'm also pro child.  However, you can label me as you wish, I'll allow it. During most conversations I am NOT the commonly accepted description of pro-choice</comment>

<comment>So in addition to supporting women and their children, you would use the force of law prevent them from choosing to not have those children? Incentives plus prohibition and punishment?</comment>

<comment>I concede I do not have a fully formed opinion on the punishment side of law.  As I said, my focus would favor support.  Off the top of my head, I might hold whoever performed it more accountable than the pregnant mother that needs help.  It is a nuanced subject that requires more thought from me, to be sure.</comment>

<comment>That is the cop out I hear from pro life friends. "I would punish the doctor, not the woman."I don't get that at all. Its the woman who decides to abort, not the doctor.If you want to make something illegal, you have to consider the implications, and one of those is punishment for violating the law. If abortion is murdering a human life, after deliberately planning to do so...well that should require stiff consequences for all involved.Which is why I call BS on the "life begins at conception" argument. It is meaningless. Life is a continuum, not a moment.</comment>

<comment>Because I personally have not figured out the perfect solution to rectify and issue just punishment, we should allow it to continue?  I vehemently disagree with this.  Even in our justice system as-is it is common to separate the determination of wrongdoing from the appropriate punishment.  I've made a decision on the former, I'm contemplating the latter.What's the exact amount of appropriate jail time for a thief, a murderer, a rapist?  Should I force you to supply the exact level of justice to be levied in order to accept that you think those acts are wrong?  Of course not.</comment>

<comment>Its not just you Bob. Its the entire anti-abortion movement except for the radical fringe, which would be happy to give lethal injections to doctors who perform abortions.If you are going to try and end abortions by making them illegal, then you have an obligation to follow that on through to some conclusion about punishment. Its a total cop out to claim people are murdering babies an then shrug off the punishment."What's the exact amount of appropriate jail time for a thief, a murderer, a rapist?"Exactly. We have prescribed punishments for these crimes. If abortion is a taking of a human life then that is murder. Can't have this both ways.</comment>

<comment>This is simply not reality.  I already told you I'm not in favor of punitive punishment or retribution.  We already have ways to deal with things that are against the law but not addressed via prison time.  Other modern justice systems also have rehabilitation and support policies in place depending on the law.  Prison isn't the only option when discussing legality and I've said explicitly that I am NOT obsessing over punishment.  At this point it just sounds like you are trying to goad me into saying something.  I have almost no faith that your response to me would change whether I said "slap on the wrist" or "send em to the guillotine".What's more concerning to me is allowing that life is on some sort of spectrum within this topic, as you mentioned before.  So are you in favor of allowing abortion when something displays a shred of life, or has to be "fully alive" or some arbitrary measure in between alive and dead?The "let someone do what they want with their body" is a bunk line of thinking.  We don't allow self mutilation, you can't cut your own head off, and even among those that want more liberal drug policies, few are advocating for legalizing the most hardcore drugs.  So we as a society have never, and probably will never, just allow anyone to do "whatever they want" with their bodies.  You need to clarify why THIS specific act is fine do to within that context, and it comes down to the question that we glossed over.  Is the thing within the woman a life or is it not?  If it is not, then it makes sense to allow someone to remove it.  If it is, then you are weighing the rights of two beings against each other.  This is fundamental to the question and I have not seen you address it, which is why I ask again for you to clarify your life-on-a-spectrum statement.</comment>

<comment>"There is no positive right that exists that gives one entity the *right* to non-consensually use the body of another."Blocks of Swiss cheese are less riddled with holes than this line of thinking.  That is the entire biological nature of a pregnancy and parses the meaning of 'consent' into circular uselessness.  A newborn never 'consents' to being born - using your logic its rights are somehow violated by its own existence.   Not to mention, what of the act of a consensual conception, then?A dying 5yo, really? How sophomoric.  In that hypothetical, are you actively terminating the life or passively allowing nature to take it's course?  That analogy is trying to morally equate an abortion with a natural miscarriage.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>"So there is a fundamental right to use, and harm, other people's bodies for our own benefit?"Use, yes, that's what pregnancy is.  At some point in their lives, humans are biologically dependent on the body of another human.  Your acknowledgment/lack thereof of it as a right doesn't change this.  Equating this to an organ transplant is a complete false equivalency and honestly I can't see how anyone would ever buy that."Just because biology IS a certain way does not mean that it OUGHT to be that way."  This statement on its own is not incorrect, but is by no means an argument for or against what you're saying.  I'm saying it OUGHT to be that way because the thing inside a pregnant woman is a life.  You are saying it ought not to be because you are failing to acknowledge it as a life and so your only moral concern is agency.  Pointing out the difference between ought/is is kind of a waste of time, I know what you're saying ought to be, but it's not clear that you understand what I'm saying ought to be."Consent to sex is not consent to gestation. The woman doesn't force the sperm and egg together, and she doesn't force the conceptus to implant inside her body. A woman is incapable, even with tubal ligation and birth control, of completely controlling the unconscious process of ovulation and fertilization."Continued parsing of the meaning of "consent".  You cannot actively consent to an indeterminable number of biological processes.  I can't consent to breathing.  I can't consent to my dependence on nourishment.  It's not even clear what your understanding of consent is.  Are you outraged at the tragedy of human enslavement to other biological processes as well, or just this one?"Embryos die because they are denied the use of women's bodies. They have no right to use a woman's body, her organs, as a biological life support machine. That dying 5yo has no right to anyone's organs either. Both die because they are denied the organs of another." This is fallacious, it's the moral equating of failing to stop a murder is the same thing as pulling the trigger.Your last line is telling, I am starting to understand how you justify this.  You delicately call it an "embryo".  Is this some alien thing that is not human?  What exactly do you consider it?  In honest, I am genuinely curious for the perspective.  We're dancing around the real core of the issue here.  You do not consider the embryo human, and I do.  That is why I am comfortable prioritizing its life over the restriction of disallowing someone to remove it from their body.  Since you do not consider it a life, you can easily justify allowing it to be removed, as if pulling a hair out of one's head.And you can stop saying 'grow up', it doesn't get you anywhere.</comment>

<comment>The diatribe by Rush was symptomatic of the wider view of the right. Women who have sex outside of marriage are sluts. Birth control is for sluts.That is evidence that this is not about abortion. Its about controlling women's sexual lives. If it really were about the life of a "child," they would be trying to impose legal penalties on women who abort. But they aren't. They are simply trying to take away the legal right to abort, which would not prevent abortions for reasons we all know. Big difference.</comment>

<comment>Why do you keep using "they"?  The world is not a clean dichotomy as your rhetoric would suggest.  This is insanely ignorant.  Does it really escape you that there is a possibility that for many abortion is a moral issue, and that it's possible to be pro life yet completely ambivalent towards passing judgement on women's sexuality?  You rail against those who oppose abortion for the sake of suppression sexuality.  I'm fine with that.  You've said nothing that addresses those who oppose abortion on purely moral (outside of sexuality) grounds.</comment>

<comment>"Does it really escape you that there is a possibility that for many abortion is a moral issue, and that it's possible to be pro life yet completely ambivalent towards passing judgement on women's sexuality?"Sure, its possible. But that isn't what the anti abortion movement, manifested as politics, is all about. It is about control, using morality as a weapon. In doing this, political and religious leaders sweep up the few who are in it for purely moral reasons and use them the achieve other goals.People who strongly oppose abortion on moral grounds are free to not have abortions. But when their morality is harnessed to other ends, we ought to recognize this for what it is.</comment>

There has been nothing to substantiate that this is the prevailing reality other than pointing to Mike Huckabee, who is a shrinking minority within his own party and will never be relevant enough again to have a spot at the table during future abortion discussions.  Look at how fewer Americans identify as religious/active Christian yet the abortion divide remains the same.  If what you are saying is true, there should be a far stronger correlation."People who strongly oppose abortion on moral grounds are free to not have abortions. But when their morality is harnessed to other ends, we ought to recognize this for what it is."This is fine with me within the context of fringe political players using the abortion conversation to impose other aspects of their worldview, like sexuality.  But this also does not address my point: that there is a not-insignificant population of pro-life supporters that truly morally support the idea of human life beginning at conception (or at least aren't decided enough to be comfortable with it), irrespective of the morality of sexuality.  The debate you are trying to have does not address that view.</comment>

<comment>"But this also does not address my point: that there is a not-insignificant population of pro-life supporters that truly morally support the idea of human life beginning at conception, ..."I don't understand this term "morally support." Or what it implies for that matter. Is "human life" on a continuum, or is it just black or white. Like a light switch going on or off?Because if it is like the light switch, then that means there can be no compromise. No abortion....period.Is this your position?</comment>

<comment>"I don't understand this term "morally support." Or what it implies for that matter. Is "human life" on a continuum, or is it just black or white. Like a light switch going on or off?"Real talk between us, this is a great question and I think a lot of people struggle with it.  It took me a long time to decide for myself when talking about it.  The truth is, if we go by the "viability" measure, that's a horrifying thin line.  Viability without medical technology?  Viability on a child's own?  What if advances in medicine change the viability question?  To me, conception is the most definitive line, that's why I'm most comfortable with it.  I'm aware others have their own view... that's mine.</comment>

<comment>You are entitled to draw your own line. Its when you try and draw that line for others that it becomes a problem.</comment>

<comment>That's why the answer to this question is fundamental to your/my stance.  We draw such a line for others constantly.  They're called laws.  Many try to frame this conversation as "you are preventing someone from doing something".  That's a ludicrous conversation to have. It is done with regularity, that's what laws do.  In this case, I believe it is morally right to prevent someone from doing something because, otherwise, their doing that thing infringes on the right of another life (if I'm viewing a fetus as a life).  When the question becomes the right of a life vs. the right of a choice, to me it's an easy decision.  To those that have not recognized a life, they'll come to a different conclusion.</comment>

<comment>Viability is when the state can take an equal interest in the fetus as well as the woman, because obviously prior to that it can't as the fetus isn't viable without the woman, so the woman's rights are all that matter (if the woman dies so does the fetus). Conception (itself a wishy area spanning several days) doesn't change that.I don't think many people struggle with it at all. They just like to make up lines so they can feel morally superior. None of these people state their age as 9 months older than that stated on their birth certificate.</comment>

<comment>The only thing Roe vs Wade settled is that at the time of the decision the Supreme Court couldn't scientifically determine when life begins. This is no longer the case and Roe vs Wade needs to be re-addressed.</comment>

<comment>It determined that women have a constitutional right to an abortion, and that the state could only but in after viability.</comment>

<comment>No it didn't. It determmined that the government has a responsibility to protect life but that the state was unable at the time to scientifically determine when life begins. Thus it would not protect that possible life and allowed abortions.Please be aware that this was done as part of the world governments population control efforts. We always knew life starts at conception.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...not really. You are mixing theology with science.</comment>

<comment>how could anyone disagree with dennis reynolds??</comment>

<comment>The Catholic Church is big on controlling people's sexual behavior and reproduction, as are most other conservative sects.</comment>

<comment>GOP Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee has frequently shamed women about sex, from accusing them of wanting "Uncle Sugar" to control their libidos to slamming the Obama girls for listening to Beyonce (which presumably makes them little s l u t s).  Jeb Bush supported legislation as governor that would have forced women to publish their sexual histories in the newspaper after giving birth if they declined to name a father.   Rick Santorum rarely opens his mouth without complaining about women having sex and using contraception.  There's a constant drumbeat of conservative media talking heads and pundits who complain about contraceptive coverage on the grounds that it allows women to have sex without "consequences," from Fox to Red State to CNN.  And then there are all of the questionable things that various GOP pols have spouted off about rape.Conservatives support abstinence only sex ed, which tells young girls that they are as worthless as used chewing gum if they have sex and is proven to increase teen pregnancy and STD infections.  They oppose successful teen pregnancy reduction programs like Colorado's on the grounds that they encourage girls to have sex.  They oppose making emergency contraception (Plan B) available in pharmacies. They are trying to eliminate poor women's access to contraception by defunding Title X and Planned Parenthood.  They oppose contraceptive coverage under Obamacare because it leads to women having sex without getting pregnant.  They support efforts by employers to impose their religious views about sex and contraception on employees (Hobby Lobby decision).  Et cetera.</comment>

<comment>Dude...the evidence has been what conservatives have been loudly and publicly doing the past years. Its in front of your nose.</comment>

<comment>Actually it's not silly. Why do conservatives oppose contraception but not vasectomies?</comment>

<comment>That's easy. Because the people who call themselves pro-life are often in support of the death penalty. You can't claim to be pro-life if you think it's OK to put people to death. Therefore, your reason for opposing abortion has to do with something other than preserving life.</comment>

<comment>Have you seen the typical conservative sex education in the past 30 (maybe 50?) years? Not just the abstinence only garbage, but even what they are trying to pass off as comprehensive.It all comes down to an attempt at shaming and blaming girls for causing "boys to be boys", not to mention the pervasive push to limit contraceptive access as much as humanly possible. Even the over the counter contraceptive bills, which in theory provide wider access to contraceptives, actually make it more of a burden to obtain them due to the way insurance companies treat over the counter medicine.Maybe many people that fall on the pro-life side of the argument don't want to restrict access, but there's a very public push to make contraceptives as difficult to obtain as possible by the conservative representation. It's such an absurd position when there are very clear examples of how to reduce unwanted pregnancies, which everyone can agree is important, and much of the conservative legislation effort is aimed at doing the exact opposite of what works.</comment>
