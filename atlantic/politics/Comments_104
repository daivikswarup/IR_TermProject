<comment>A missed opportunity to perp walk them all to an express flight to Gitmo.</comment>

<comment>Good point. https://www.youtube.com/channe...</comment>

<comment>In a civilized country, Mr. Cheney would be ensconsed in the slammer for a lengthy respite.</comment>

<comment>There are countries that would like to get their hands on the sleaze</comment>

<comment>Wonder why they didn't laugh about his 5 deferments from the military draft? Is he to important to die lie the rest of  many our family members did? He sure had no problem sending in our sons and daughters to help fight and die for the oil companies like Halliburton and Condie Rice's Chevron corporations, did he? F ing hypocrite and coward.</comment>

<comment>Were you upset when draft dodger Bill Clinton sent our servicemen to die? How about Obama, who also never served? Or are you just another leftist who's selective in their outrage?</comment>

<comment>There's a big difference in rushing into a war ***with the wrong country*** and inheriting a mess one must schlog through as best one can.</comment>

<comment>Well, for one, we didn't "rush to war". The world had been at odds with Saddam Hussein for over a decade. Further, both Clinton and Obama got us involved in conflicts which were entirely of their choosing. Clinton escalated our involvement in Somalia, Iraq and Bosnia and Obama went to war in Libya. Again, the selective outrage is the height of hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>Sure all those U.S. soldiers who died in Libya are a tragedy...what?  How many died?  Zero?  Never mind... http://www.dailykos.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>The war on ISIS began under Obama. The men who died in Somalia did so under orders from Clinton.Should only those who have served in the military be allowed to run for President?</comment>

<comment>Oh the war on ISIS began well before that. I was in Iraq at the time, helping to target the bastards. They haven't changed, they've just gone multinational.</comment>

<comment>No.  No it didn't.  Jesus, you people have literally no long term memory.  None.  And apparently your access to "teh google machine" is blocked or something.  Just make up garbage with a hint of outrage.And, no.  What does that have to do with anything?  We have a civilian Commander in Chief, and he's a good one.  Eisenhower was also a good one, from a military background.  Usually "indict by question" means something.  Not this time, I guess.</comment>

<comment>The Syrian civil war began in 2011. That was in Obama's first term. Apparently your "google machine" is broken too.</comment>

<comment>ISIS didn't begin with the Syrian civ...oh, fugg it.  Hopeless. Syriously.</comment>

<comment>ISI (Islamic State in Iraq) was formed in 2006 and the majority of ISIL's leadership to this day is from the Ba'ath Party that was deposed when Saddam Hussein was overthrown.</comment>

<comment>Are you saying that Hillary is the good mother hen because she got away with murder - as in there was no blowback for more than 20 minutes following her turning a perfectly good country into a jihadist wasteland?</comment>

<comment>You were complaining about "leading from behind," and now you're accusing Hillary of leading from the front?  I suspect you just like to complain.  I'm no Hillary fan, BTW.  Pro-Iraq, pro-Wall Steet, anti-consumer, pro-PATRIOT Act, she is soooooo not my candidate of choice.  If the Democrats get their collective ostrich-heads out of the sand and get Sanders to the general election,  I'm all for it.</comment>

<comment>You're right, there have been other wars of choice. It was a poor choice of wars of choice, though. And I'd say there were a few more avenues to try before regime change. Not least backing down from a useless stand off with the dictator of a country which posed no credible threat to us.</comment>

<comment>Are you conveniently forgetting that the Iraq War was based on a lie? That the only reason we invaded Iraq was because Cheney and George W. lied to Congress and to the American people. And for what? So the craven Cheney could luxuriate in all the money (reportedly $39.5 billion) he made via government contracts to KBR, Inc., which was spun off from its parent company, Halliburton?And George W's "concern" with the Iraqi oil fields. They quickly posted troops at the sites of the oil fields as soon as the invasion began. And there was not even as much concern for our troops, as there was for the oil fields. They had to scrounge around for scrap metal just to fortify their not-ready-for-combat vehicles. You can whine on and on about hypocrisy if that makes you feel any better. But everyone knows that our troops and all those dead and wounded Iraqi civilians were nothing but collateral, simply the cost of war, and nothing more. A war that should never have been waged at all. I hope someone smashes that stupid smirking bust.</comment>

<comment>Er but we and allies and Nato won in the Balkans and saved millions of lives.  Or did you miss that documented part of history.  Clinton also never lied (did not have too) about what was going on in Serbia and Croatia.  You need to brush up on history junior.  It has been proven. Bush, Cheney, Tennent and Bremmer ALL lied...and got people killed as a result ....for nothing....  Technically Bremmer is at fault for planting seeds of ISIS (get new book Black Flags) for firing the Iraqi Army...they turned into terrorists</comment>

<comment>Actually, it hasn't been proved that anyone "lied" with regards to the Iraq war. There is zero evidence for that. The fact that the intelligence was wrong doesn't constitute a "lie".Saddam was a much bigger butcher and was killing more people on a yearly basis than what was occurring in the Balkans.Like I said, some of you hypocrites need to look in the mirror once in a while.</comment>

<comment>And we propped him up during many of those butchering years. Because our mideast policy has always been shortsighted.</comment>

<comment>Actually, we didn't. Saddam was a client of the Soviet Union, not the United States. We gave him some limited intelligence during the Iran/Iraq war, but that was just to keep Iran in check.</comment>

<comment>That's the most delusional revisionism I've ever heard, and Republicans have been trying to sell me "no major terror attacks under Bush." We sold him chemical weapons. He was buddies with Reagan and Rumsfeld. Detroit gave him the key to the city.</comment>

<comment>We didn't sell him chemical weapons. He also wasn't "buddies" with Reagan. While the US tried to move him into our "camp" under Reagan during the Cold War, he remained tied to the Soviet Union. We didn't make the T-72 tanks, AK 47's, or Sukhoi aircraft he used for his military, the Soviets did.</comment>

<comment>Here's a fairly conservative site with a document dump of CIA files showing the Reagan Administration coordinating chemical warfare with Saddam.</comment>

<comment>Actually, we gave them intelligence on Iran's troop movements. We in no way assisted with chemical attacks. None of that, by the way, changes what I said. They continued to be a client state of the USSR.</comment>

<comment>Read the documents, willya?</comment>

<comment>Except when we DID assist with the chemical attacks:https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>We gave them intelligence on troop movements. We didn't assist in chemical attacks.</comment>

<comment>We sure as hell didn't. Read through the documents I posted. Or you could just read how we SUPPLIED them with the materials that they used in the chemical attacks and even gave them targets therein:http://www.nytimes.com/interac...</comment>

<comment>That Iraq was able to use false front companies to get US technology and chemical precursors isn't the same as saying the US willingly gave Iraq chemical weapons. That's absurd.</comment>

<comment>We looked the other way in light of this evidence. How are the two not functionally the same?</comment>

<comment>But we didn't look the other way. We didn't knowingly transfer any sort of weapons or precursors to Iraq. It most definitely isn't the same.</comment>

<comment>They amounted to the same result, did they not?</comment>

<comment>So, if I purchase your car under false pretenses to use it in an armed robbery, are you complicit in the robbery? Of course not. Again, your being absurd.</comment>

<comment>No, it's more like the police saw a crime in progress and did nothing to stop it. Then we're talking about complicity and murder from inaction.</comment>

<comment>How do we stop it? Start bombing Iraq? That would have been impossible. If we would have inserted ourselves into the Iran/Iraq war at the time we would have been putting ourselves in danger of conflict with the Soviet Union.</comment>

<comment>How about INTERDICTING, at minimum, the flow of chemical weapons and associated material to Saddam beforehand?</comment>

<comment>How do you interdict something that isn't coming through the US? Further, this wasn't during the embargo era. Those restrictions weren't placed upon Iraq until after the first Gulf War.</comment>

<comment>The weapons and chemicals weren't going through the United States, and there wasn't an embargo at the time. This was pre Gulf War. Further, anything we would have done would have been opposed by the Soviet Union.</comment>

<comment>https://www.rt.com/news/196152...</comment>

<comment>I am not sure what this is supposed to prove. We knew Iraq had chemical weapons. We didn't directly supply them or build them for the Iraqi's.</comment>

<comment>A lie doesn't become true simply because it gets repeated over and over.</comment>

<comment>The only lie is that we were aiding them in launching chemical attacks. No one has given any evidence to show otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Good grief, only if the definition of "aid" doesn't include selling them delivery systems for the chemical weapons and giving them satellite intelligence on Iraqi troop movements. It seems as if your definition of aid has to have an American finger push the button that launched the attacks.People disagreeing with you have furnished multiple citations. All you've done is say over and over that this mountain of evidence is a lie. Not very convincing.</comment>

<comment>Did you even read the links? We didn't give them the delivery systems. And if you think giving them intel on troop movements is the same as being directly involved in ordering chemical attacks, then I don't know what to tell you.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I read the links. Did you? You're moving the goalposts. First it was aiding, now it's "directly involved in ordering," which kind of proves my point about your definition having to have an American finger push the button. I'm done here.</comment>

<comment>If you had read the links you would know we didn't provide the delivery systems. That's simply false.Further, that we aided Iraq to help stop a larger Iranian incursion doesn't support the notion that Saddam was "our guy", or that we propped him up. None of those assertions are true.</comment>

<comment>Really? I always thought FP was always a bit centrist and left-of-center or right-of-center at most, not "fairly conservative". haha.</comment>

<comment>Really? Well here are the documents straight from the horse's mouth that prove you indisputably wrong:http://www.scribd.com/doc/1630...http://www.scribd.com/doc/1630...http://www.scribd.com/doc/1630...http://www.scribd.com/doc/1630...And  if Reagan wasn't buddies with Saddam, then try explaining THIS:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Or this:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>You should probably read all of my responses in this thread. I already said that we supplied intelligence to Iraq during the late stages of the Iran/Iraq war. That we sent emissaries to Iraq to meet with Saddam also doesn't mean that we were successful in moving them into our camp. because we weren't. We didn't have a close working relationship with Saddam's Iraq during his entire time in power.</comment>

<comment>See my previous response or even the documents themselves.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me? We gave them weapons (vis a vis the Saudis), we were designing their air bombing operations for them,  and we were deeply involved in supplying intelligence, etc. And we did so at a time when Hussein gassed the Kurds, among other atrocities.</comment>

<comment>Which weapons did we give them? Please be specific. Our intelligence support was limited to intel involving Iranian troop movements. We were never more deeply involved than that, especially considering how close Saddam was to the Soviet Union at the time.</comment>

<comment>You damn well know we were using third parties (namely Jordan, Egypt, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) to transfer weapons to Iraq during that time period.And your assessment that our intel was limited to Iranian troop movements is laughably and provably false. Why you are trying to deny our shortsighted history on Hussein is beyond me.</comment>

<comment>The major arms suppliers to Saddam's Iraq were the Soviet Union (and Easter Block), France and Brazil.http://www.rand.org/content/da...If you have evidence of the intelligence sharing. link it. I would like to see your sources.</comment>

<comment>Dude, there's about a million sources out there, try Google. I find it telling you keep sidestepping the main point here.  Note that Russia being the "major" supplier says nothing about US involvement.</comment>

<comment>Right, it doesn't say anything about US involvement because we weren't a supplier to Saddam's Iraq. If you have evidence that shows otherwise, you should probably post it. I mean, if there are really "millions" of documents.</comment>

<comment>1. Google2. type "Iraq Ronald Reagan gas attack"3. Hit Enter</comment>

<comment>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Ronnie Reagan took Iraq off the State Departments list of Terrorism Sponsors so gas-precursors could be shipped to Iraq.  Typing this took more time than finding it.</comment>

<comment>You're implying something that didn't happen. While Iraq was taken off of the State Departments list in the 80's, it wasn't so Iraq could be provided with WMD precursors. That's simply false. Supplying Iraq with chemical weapons, precursors or otherwise, was still prohibited. Which is why Iraq turned to false front companies and agents to get what they needed. Absolutely nothing was knowingly shipped or provided to Iraq for their WMD production.A decent look at how Iraq got around the bans in order to buy what they needed from US companies is here:http://www.nytimes.com/interac...</comment>

<comment>There are many dictators all over the world who can be considered "butchers". That is not a reason for us to invade those countries. One can even say that, after our invasion, how much better off were the Iraqi people?</comment>

<comment>You're still defending the Bush Administration? Man, you must be one of those Dead Enders Cheney tried to warn us about.</comment>

<comment>It's not about defending the Bush administration. It's about correctly stupidity.</comment>

<comment>Can't really argue with that</comment>

<comment>Oh Snap!!! Burn!!feck off</comment>

<comment>Billythegoat Clinton of bombing aspirin factories in Sudan and TV stations in Serbia, Doublecrap Bush commander of torture and king of dumb, Hillary of Waco a Libya massacres fame, Cheney the psycho killer, they are all part of the same sadistic tribe of power-addicted criminal politicians who would kill for power.</comment>

<comment>I'm surprised he wasn't 3-F with all his cardiovascular issues.  The deferrals may be a moot point.</comment>

<comment>That's right. Despicable criminals are people too. And not to give him a bust would have hurt his feelings.</comment>

<comment>So, the Capitol has a Chamber of Horrors!</comment>

<comment>More terrifying than any Halloween haunted house.</comment>

<comment>As the leaders of what is now called isil go about their rampage of destruction they remember the lives they had pre VP Dick Cheney, in an Iraq were they were generals or high ranking public officials. Cheney and company destroyed their lives their dreams and expectations for their children indeed their country. As each head is chopped off each innocent slaughtered those once upper class Iraqis envision the head of Dick Cheney falling to the floor, it is he who lit the fuse that Americans 50 years from now will still be trying to extinguish. It is he who bears the responsibility for the ruination of our country for decades to come.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget Paul Bremer,  he is one who fired the Iraqi army under Cheney's direction and believe it or not without telling George Bush!</comment>

<comment>The fish stinks from the Bust of Cheney Down</comment>

<comment>He was a great Vice President who cared about his country. Glad to see him taking a place of honor.</comment>

<comment>He loves his country, 39.5 billion in no-bid contracts, I would love my country too!</comment>

<comment>You are referring to the LOGCAP contract, which isn't "no bid", it's competitive. Secondly, Cheney didn't benefit from the Iraq war contracts. He was no longer involved with KKR.</comment>

<comment>You know this stuff is still on the internet, right?  http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ch...</comment>

<comment>Of course it is. The compensation he received after leaving Halliburton was deferred from 1999, well before he was in office. There is also zero evidence that Cheney pulled any strings to get Halliburton the LOGCAP contract in 2001.</comment>

<comment>I actually have a big problem with deferments. The legal wrangling that make those kinds of deals possible cleverly sidestep conflicts of interest. Such arrangement should not be allowed.Btw Halliburton did win one very big sole-source contract through its subsidiary, Kellogg Brown & Root, which yielded billions.</comment>

<comment>Yes, KBR did receive further contracts, and there was zero evidence that Cheney was involved in awarding them in any way.</comment>

<comment>Therefore, people should continue to get deferments from corporations who profit from government contracts? No, sorry, I stand on principle on this one.</comment>

<comment>When the deferred money had nothing to do with the future contracts or awards there is no conflict of interest.</comment>

<comment>Pfff.</comment>

<comment>You didn't read it, did you?  I know, you don't have to read it to know it's "liberal spin," right?</comment>

<comment>I did read it. He received deferred compensation for several years after leaving Halliburton, and had exercised his stock options in 2000. In other words, he wasn't involved in either a decision making capacity nor was he able to benefit from any Halliburton contracts after that time. Further, there is zero evidence he was involved in awarding the LOGCAP contract in 2001.</comment>

<comment>He and Haliburton should be funding the WWP....Want to help the wounded veterans, stop making them!</comment>

<comment>The guy's a Dick.</comment>

<comment>They oughta put it in the bunker he hid in after 9/11</comment>

<comment>Where, exactly, should our political leadership be during an attack on this country? Especially one that possibly involved ramming airliners into government buildings? Do you think Obama would have been on top of the White House with a SAM launcher?</comment>

<comment>How about not cowering in a hole? Hell, Bush didn't do it.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Bush was flown on Air Force One to Offutt Air Force base where and stayed in the SAC bunker until the all clear was given. That you think the President (or Vice President) shouldn't take cover in such an event might be one of the dumbest things I have ever read.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but Bush came out and addressed the nation when things stopped blowing up. He was at Ground Zero the next day telling people to go shopping. Cheney just kind of lurked down there, like one of those trapdoor spiders or Saddam Hussein.</comment>

<comment>Since when has the VP ever taken the lead in such cases? It's silly to think that he would have been the face of the administration during that time. It's the President's job to be out there after such an event.Look, I get it that you have a weird hate for Cheney, like many on the left. But this line of attack is pretty dumb.</comment>

<comment>weird hateYeah, it's completely inexplicable!Anyway, if you're trying to get the country to go back to normal after a terror attack it helps to not have it be common knowledge that the **second** most powerful man in the world is constantly duck-and-covering. Then again, that's assuming you want the country to get back to normal. We've been living in the Homeland Security State ever since.</comment>

<comment>Do you think that Obama should give up his Secret Service protection? I mean, by your standards, he is a coward for keeping them.</comment>

<comment>I'd call that a straw man but they're barely protecting him anyways.</comment>

<comment>Well, I am just taking your argument to its logical conclusion. If you think our elected leadership should forego all Secret Service protections and "man up", just say so.</comment>

<comment>I actually think the Secret Service is a reasonable precaution and routinely retiring to a taxpayer-funded bunker is not, and that's my "logical conclusion." I really don't see what the two have to do with each other.</comment>

<comment>So we agree that our leadership should be protected, and that Secret Service protocol which called for the leadership to take  cover in bunkers during a possible attack from the air should be followed.I am not sure where your assertion that Cheney "routinely" retired to the bunker comes from. Are you confusing "bunker" with the situation room?</comment>

<comment>Lynne, is that you?</comment>

<comment>It appears he only got a bust in the Capital Building because every VP gets one, apparently even war criminals.</comment>

<comment>What war crime did he commit? Who is doing the prosecuting?</comment>

<comment>He is directly responsible for the deaths of over 4000 Americans and much of the disruption in the middle east. Unfortunately no one is prosecuting. That is the travesty of the situation.</comment>

<comment>So, he was only a "war criminal" in your feverish little mind. Got it.</comment>

<comment>No, not really. Only in your mind is he a decent human being.</comment>

<comment>It's weird how the left has turned removing a murderous dictator into a war crime. That shows a level of unhealthy derangement rarely seen in politics.</comment>

<comment>You may be one of about five people in this country who still believes that the Iraq war was justified.</comment>

<comment>Based upon what I know now, I wouldn't have supported it. It's obvious that the people of the ME are going to have to continue killing each other for a few more generations before they are ready for representative and free societies. That doesn't mean that it was the wrong decision based upon what we knew then, and it certainly doesn't make anyone guilty of "war crimes".</comment>

<comment>"Cheney loyalist, party of one, your table is ready in the loneliest restaurant in the universe."</comment>

<comment>Was this inscribed on the bust? 'My belief is we will, in fact, be greeted as liberators.”</comment>

<comment>More likely his famous quote while on the Senate floor: http://www.washingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>followed by a Jon-Stewart-does-Cheney "mehhhhh"</comment>

<comment>"Deficits don't matter."</comment>

<comment>Yes, right under "The war will pay for itself"  and  "The insurgency in Iraq is "in the last throes,".</comment>

<comment>An "Iron Ass" and now a thick Bronze skull to boot.  How appropriate for a war criminal...and Mussolini only had an Iron Fist.</comment>

<comment>Well played</comment>

<comment>This rendition (no pun intended) of Cheney sets a dangerous president. "Those who ignore the past are doomed to repeat it." It's presence in this most hallowed place (more appropriate to locate it in the Wyoming Statehouse or Halliburton HQ) legitimizes his destructive acts against this nation. When memories dim and new eyes from another generation see this bust I hope they have the tenacity to have it removed. For they'll still be paying for the price of his actions.</comment>

<comment>"dangerous president"well that's a fortunate misspelling.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't a clever play on words?</comment>

<comment>Could be. Either way, I liked it.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure Cheney's family are nice folks, I'm glad they had a cool get together at the capitol.However, someone needs to get the mold and make a 3D printer file of this thing. I can picture it printed out in green, glowing on a side table as a rather creepy ironic lamp. I imagine other people might find more creative use for it, though.</comment>

<comment>Someday they'll tear that statue down, just like Saddam. A better people will be appalled to have the bust of a torture-apologist sitting in a place of honor.</comment>

<comment>Hey, how about commissioning the National Spittoon to be built somewhere between the Capitol and the WH. It should be in the shape of a pool of blood and ornate with the luminous mugs of the likes of Cheney, Hillary, Billy the husband, Doublecrap Bush... you get the idea.</comment>

<comment>I always got the sense that Bush II eventually realized in his second term that he made a horrible, horrible mistake in Iraq.I never got that sense from Cheney. And that is very bad.</comment>

<comment>Doublecrap is not smart enough to realize anything.</comment>

<comment>That name pun is as bad as Obummer. In fact, worse.</comment>

<comment>Too bad he doesn't get to pick his own historians.</comment>

<comment>Of course he does.</comment>

<comment>Some of his historians haven't been born yet.</comment>

<comment>Thank you FOX news for all of this.</comment>

<comment>Shouldn't it have a blindfold and ball gag?</comment>

<comment>I don't think there's any problem with Cheney being remembered - as the architect of a disastrous Middle East policy - Daesh, anyone - that we're still dealing with, and will have to deal with for years if not decades to come.  Thanks, Dick!Anyhoo, I had hoped from the headline that Cheney had finally been arrested and charged with multiple counts of war crimes.</comment>

<comment>The comments here just underscore the fact that Cheney is an adult in a nation overrun with  pampered  perpetual adolescents who are incapable of making tough decisions.</comment>

<comment>Or a congenital liar and heartless, literally, Machiavellian bastard in a nation overrun with people who care about the truth and the principles on which America was founded.  One or the other.</comment>

<comment>Projection runs amok in you.</comment>

<comment>You're right.  It was based on *my* lies that this nation was deceived into invading Iraq.  And I would have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn't for you meddling kids.</comment>

<comment>I am pretty sure the "Bush and Cheney Lied" and the "Obama is a Kenyan" people are two sides of the same coin. It's a weird, obsessive delusion.</comment>

<comment>Yes, because there was plenty of evidence to support the invasion of Iraq, while there is no evidence that Obama was born in America.  Wait.  Strike that.  Reverse it.</comment>

<comment>There was plenty of evidence to support the invasion of Iraq. That you don't agree with them didn't make them lies.</comment>

<comment>Dude, it's not whether I "agree" with the "evidence" or not; that sh!t was demonstrably false, and everyone knew it was false, even at the time.  Valerie Plame, anyone?  Our lawmakers were gutless and allowed themselves to be "terror-shamed" into the war, but the "evidence" was completely ginned up in the fevered imaginations of the neocons.</comment>

<comment>A bipartisan Senate commission looked into the pre war Intelligence assessments and found zero evidence of either manipulation or lying:https://fas.org/irp/congress/2...By the way, in that same report, on page 39, you can read the story of Joseph Wilson's trip to Nigeria. He actually corroborated the Iraq/Niger connection.</comment>

<comment>Contra what you wrote above, Phase I of the Select Committee's report concluded that there was almost no actual evidence of WMD's and that the intelligence community based reports to the contrary on scant evidence. Phase II concluded that the Administration "repeatedly presented intelligence as fact when in reality it was unsubstantiated, contradicted, or even non-existent. As a result, the American people were led to believe that the threat from Iraq was much greater than actually existed.” So, to summarize, Phase I of the joint committee concluded that the intelligence community had minimal and bad intelligence, and Phase II concluded that the administration knew this, and sold it as the truth anyway. Throw in the administration's enthusiasm for finding a link between Iraq and 9-11, even in the midst of planning the Afghan War, and you have a pack of lies, plain and simple.</comment>

<comment>You are going to have to provide the links to your claims. They aren't backed up by the facts.</comment>

<comment>http://www.intelligence.senate...Here's the link to the Senate Intelligence committee's presser. If you want to read the report, go find it yourself.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should read the actual report rather than the self serving press release by Democrats.(U) Conclusion 2: Statements in the major speeches analyzed, as well additional statements, regarding Iraq’s possession of biological agent, weapons, production capability, and use of mobile biological laboratories were substantiated by intelligence information.(U) Conclusion 3: Statements in the major speeches analyzed, as well additional statements, regarding Iraq’s possession of chemical weapons were substantiated by intelligence information. Intelligence assessments, including the December 2000 ICA stated that Iraq had retained up to 100 metric tons of its chemical weapons stockpile. The October 2002 NIE provided a range of 100 to 500 metric tons of chemical weapons.(U) Conclusion 5: Statements by the President, Vice President, Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense regarding Iraq’s possession of weapons of mass destruction were generally substantiated by intelligence information, though many statements made regarding ongoing production prior to late 2002 reflected a higher level of certainty than the intelligence judgments themselves.(U) Conclusion 7: Statements in the major speeches and additional statements analyzed regarding Iraqi ballistic missiles were generally substantiated by available intelligence.(U) Conclusion 10: Statements in the major speeches analyzed, as well additional statements, regarding Iraq’s support for terrorist groups other than al-Qa’ida were substantiated by intelligence information. The intelligence community reported regularly on Iraq’s safe harbor and financial support for Palestinian rejectionist groups, the Abu Nidal Organization, and others. The February 2002 NIE fully supported the claim that Iraq had, and would continue, to support terrorist groups.,/I>http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/C...</comment>

<comment>Yes, a bipartisan commission comprised of the same people duped or "terror-shamed" into supporting the invasion of Iraq found "...zero evidence of either manipulation or lying."  In other news, fox guarding hen-house found no evidence of foul play in mysterious disappearance of chickens.  BTW, what did we end up doing with all of the WMD we found in Iraq?  Oh, right...</comment>

<comment>Again, the fact that no WMD stockpiles were found is proof that the intelligence was wrong, not that anyone lied. Because no one did. You can disagree with the decision all you want. That's fine. But you don't get to make up your own bogus story just feed your own narrative.</comment>

<comment>"the fact that Cheney is an adult in a nation overrun with pampered perpetual adolescents"You should do some research to find out what facts are, you seem deeply confused about that topic.</comment>

<comment>Will they take it down when he is arrested and tried for war crimes ?</comment>

<comment>From your lips to God's ears.</comment>

<comment>Oh, he'll be remembered alright and not in a good way.</comment>

<comment>Years ago while working as a glazier in San Francisco I was called to repair a broken skylight in the light well of a fleabag hotel south of Market. A resident had tossed a paper bag of something or other out his window a few floors above; the bag fell onto the glass and broke it. As I assembled my tools and began the repair job, my first task was to remove the bag from the skylight. When I did, the bag ripped open: inside were several large, rotten, whole fish. As the fish tumbled out they too ripped open and hundreds if not thousands of live maggots poured out of them and descended all over my arms and legs.This memory comes to mind as I look at the photo of Dick Cheney's bust. I urge janitors and other laborers who might have occasion to move or clean the Vice President's likeness to exercise extreme caution--I can envision it suddenly ripping open and a hoard of squirming slimy maggots gushing out and inundating an innocent proximate worker.</comment>

<comment>Graphic but apt.</comment>

<comment>Cheney's will be the one covered in Urine stains.</comment>

<comment>I don't think I've ever seen a bust so worthy of a visit from the nearest sledgehammer, before.</comment>

<comment>What's weird is, in 1994, Cheney knew EXACTLY what would happen if we removed Saddam out of power:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Of course, that was before Dubya came into power and the green light was given for MIC to once again fleece the taxpayers.  No bid contracts?  Seriously, America?</comment>

<comment>It looks nothing like him, it doesn't have horns.</comment>

<comment>Even the devil wouldn't hand those over to Dick Cheney.</comment>

<comment>Why not a bronze statue with Cheney shooting a guy in the face?</comment>

<comment>That's hilarious. That kind of sarcasm is right up my street.</comment>

<comment>It's like an inverse portrait of Dorian Gray...</comment>

<comment>That's an insult to Dorian Gray.</comment>

<comment>Dick Cheney has already been busted! He should be on trial in the Hague!</comment>

<comment>I hate that he gets to go around living his life in a bubble, thinking that he is this great person deserving of respect. I wish he could truly see himself the way the rest of the world sees him for just a second, and then he wouldn't be able to live with himself.</comment>

<comment>So this man, who should be in jail for multiple reasons, is treated like royalty? An ordinary person who did what he did would be in jail for life.Two-class legal system here, folks!</comment>

<comment>I wonder how many children taking the school tour will realize the bust represents the man who more than any killed their father or grandfather in the Asian wars started on lies fed  to the ignorant Bush.</comment>

<comment>Charge $50 to be able to amble by and spit on it;  national debt reduced to zero within 10 yrs.</comment>

<comment>Someone should topple that thing.</comment>

<comment>That will send small children, screaming in terror, from the Capital Building.</comment>

<comment>A marble bust of a criminal...YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.</comment>

<comment>How long before someone puts a Darth Vader mask on that bust?</comment>

<comment>The ridiculous thing is you would get arrested if you climbed atop it and took a shit.</comment>

<comment>One chance at being remembered, my ass. Cheney will definitely be remembered - as a blatant war-profiteering criminal, a mass-murderer for profit. He should be chained to this bust and dumped into the sea.</comment>

<comment>Which youtube vlogger did you learn that from Michael?</comment>

<comment>Well, John, I neither know nor care to know what a "vlogger" is. Nor did I ever contemplate communicating with a "person" via youtube.</comment>

<comment>Dick Cheney was a bust for a long time already before this event.</comment>

<comment>Institutions' protocol against ethics. Perhaps Baseball Hall of Fame should also incorporate Pete Rose...</comment>

<comment>These sputtering Cheney hyperbolists are quite a riot.  Like rats lead by a fiddler, really adorable.  I am sure some cute-faced youtube personality turned them on to just how 'evil' he is, and they swallow it up like saps.</comment>

<comment>A marble bust. What a waste - an appropriate medium would have been shit!</comment>
