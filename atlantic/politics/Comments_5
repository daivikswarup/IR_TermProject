<comment>What a country!</comment>

<comment>I reject the author's argument in favor of Cruz being eligible.  His father was not an American citizen nor living in USA when Cruz was born.  While his mother was a citizen (as I have read), she apparently turned her back on the USA a moved to Canada full time, unlike McCain whose father was in the military, McCain was born on a USA military base.  There is nothing in history with which to compare the Cruz situation.  I think his connection to be declared eligible is thin and I agree with Tribe, although I am no fan of his.</comment>

<comment>Being born on an overseas US military base carries no specific weight with regard to being born a US citizen.  US citizenship at birth would still be dependent on US law with regard to parental status.</comment>

<comment>So... his mother was a citizen therefore he is a citizen. Her residency, and indeed the location of his birth are irrelevant, except insofar as it means he was a dual citizen at birth.</comment>

<comment>For purposes of US citizenship, being "born on a USA military base" is no different from being born on the surrounding territory.</comment>

<comment>I reject the argument that you're a real person. You're a well designed markov bot married to a selenium script. I read it online.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is an anchor baby. Are Y'all really gonna vote for an anchor baby? Do y'all think an anchor baby will deport anchor babies?</comment>

<comment>Legal immigrants don't need "anchors." They're here legally, and therefore have a system of laws to protect them.</comment>

<comment>Your point is orthogonal to mine. Do you really think Rubio will ramp up enforcement of immigration law? </comment>

<comment>He's not an "anchor," so my point is actually diametrically opposed. Rubio is undeniably softer on immigration than his Republican counterparts, but given that the current administration might as well build bridges over the Rio Grande and that Trump and Cruz advocate no-knock deportation raids, I think I'll hew to the center, personally.</comment>

<comment>His parents weren't citizens when he was born. We have different definitions of anchor baby to suit our different political preferences. It's not an argument worth having because I'd gladly vote for Rubios $2500/child expansion of the child tax credit if he's the nom.</comment>

<comment>The law says an "anchor baby" is a child born in the US who is the only thing keeping his/her parents from getting deported. Now that I see your definition, I do understand - I just disagree that it's an appropriate use of the term.</comment>

<comment>What does his parents' citizenship have to do with it. He was born in the US and is therefor a US citizen.</comment>

<comment>"No knock" deportation raids happen all the time, even under the second best president the country of Mexico has ever had. If you review Cruz' supposed "mass deportations" promise, he didn't say he'd do mass deportations. He included a lawyerly loophole that's as big and obvious to me as it's hidden from everyone else. He said illegal aliens would be deported "when apprehended". Like Obama, Cruz might choose to "prioritize" apprehensions.As for Rubio, apparently his parents were LPRs when he was born. "Anchor baby" is only use for those whose parents are illegal aliens.</comment>

<comment>Trump is like Glenn Beck - he's not claiming these things, he's just asking questions, or someone else is saying them and clearly he has no effect on that.</comment>

<comment>The GOP has been doing that for years. They've given a sky wink to the birther stuff while refusing to directly refute it or to stop appearing on shows of people that claimed Obama was born in Kenya. Back in his first term, a FOX News anchor asked whether or not Obama threatened to have Chelsea Clinton murdered in exchange for the Clintons keeping quiet about his real birthplace. When she was called on it, this news anchor said she was just asking questions, and how could you fault a journalist for asking questions.The GOP has been playing with these fascist Klan members for years, subtly signalling to them while maintaining plausible deniability in public. Now Trump is courting those voters openly. </comment>

<comment>All I'm saying is, Glenn Beck has never provided any definitive proof that he *didn't* rape and murder a young woman in 1990.</comment>

<comment>In the guise of railing against PC, and just asking questions, - "I don't know. I just don't know." - he enables and validates the most vile, nativist, racist feelings in a significant number of his supporters, but fortunately a relatively small number of people. However, there are more of these people than I formerly thought, so there is some informational value here, certainly enough to consider Trump a real threat rather than just a huckster or clown.</comment>

<comment>Trump's mother was not an American citizen: she was Scottish.Using his logic, he is an anchor baby and not eligible to run for office.Boom.</comment>

<comment>What does logic have to do with unprincipled tribalism?</comment>

<comment>Logic has absolutely nothing to do with it. There have been Presidents and VPs with one parent born in another country before and no one cared. We need to drop the fiction that every argument must be treated as sincere </comment>

<comment>For real. It's not like illegal immigrants are coming from Scotland to scab jobs away from Americans. There is no Slovenian supermodel jihad.</comment>

<comment>Facts never seem to work.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should ask his ex wives that. </comment>

<comment>She was a naturalized US citizen at the time of his birth.  Now whether or not Trump was also a UK subject at birth would depend on their laws.  Some countries don't strip nationality upon naturalization elsewhere.  Even so, I understand that patrilineal descent was the rule of law in the UK until after Trump's birth.</comment>

<comment>Is there anything less valuable and more pejorative than labels like "far right" or "far left"? All they do is create an impression of radicalism, which is both needlessly broad and so unsophisticated as to be below good authors. Discuss policies and specifics, not meaningless opinion-based relative measurements.</comment>

<comment>The far worse crime is being a moderate centrist like Trump.  Then, you see the true derangement of our corrupt politicos in full action.</comment>

<comment>Trump is so eclectic that if he's a "moderate" it's only by the laws of averages, and the outlying data points change constantly. God forbid his campaign continues even another minute, but it somehow wouldn't shock me if two weeks from now he's changed his mind on 90% of his "platform."</comment>

<comment>I maintain that our entire polical class, especially the DC media, is corrupt and leading us to totalitarianism.  See, Trump supporters can go Godwin too!</comment>

<comment>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</comment>

<comment>There is a special distinction in the Constitution for Presidential eligibility. It is the only office for which one must be a "natural born" citizen.  What constitutes this special class is a constitutional and legal question, but one thing is clear, the requirement is more than "native born," i.e.  born on American soil.  Thus, there is no libel to Trump's accusation.  Many believe that neither Rubio nor Cruz meet the 'natural born" requirement.</comment>

<comment>It's a fringe who believe that Rubio isn't eligible.  It's not quite a fringe that believe that Cruz isn't eligible, but it's it's unlikely that they would prevail in federal court.</comment>

<comment>So is it a fringe or isn't it?  I assume you meant Rubio in your first sentence.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - Rubio.  I edited it.There's a variety of people who cite various SCOTUS rulings - especially Minor v Happersett, but it's not terribly reliable because it was really a voting rights case and not about Presidential eligibility.  Supreme Court justices tend to write wordy opinions and go off on all sorts of tangents rather than just get to the point.</comment>

<comment>Check out Rogers v Bellei. That case involved a young man who was born in Italy to an American mother and Italian father.Bellei's citizenship had been revoked entirely because he didn't register for selective service in a timely manner.  It was a split decision.  Both sides said that Bellei was a naturalized citizen.  The majority held that he forfeited all citizenship because he hadn't established residency. The minority said he was still a naturalized citizen.But for our purposes, Bellei's birth was just like Cruz's and all SCOTUS justices held him to be a naturalized citizen and not natural-born.   How can Cruz go against that?</comment>

<comment>Aldo Bellei did not lose, and would not have lost, his US citizenship for failing to register with Selective Service.  He lost his US citizenship for failing to satisfy the retention requirements of INA Sec. 301(b).</comment>

<comment>My reading is that Bellei did register for the Selective Service by age 20 and even submitted for a physical.  There is technically a 60 day period to register after turning 18, but late registrations are allowed up to age 25, and there are rarely any penalties.  I checked my registration, and it says it was after the period, although I could have sworn I did it before I turned 18.However, the requirements to register weren't exclusive to US citizens.  Permanent residents were also required to register.</comment>

<comment>I sometimes wonder what became of Mr. Bellei.</comment>

<comment>Funny thing I just noticed-- Aldo Bellei and Ted Cruz have the same birthday.</comment>

<comment>Agree about Rubio birtherism being fringe. But Cruz is pretty flamboyantly ineligible, and SCOTUS dicta and most scholars (including many modern ones) are lining up against him.</comment>

<comment>"Many believe that neither Rubio nor Cruz meet the 'natural born" requirement."Many also believe chemtrails are a conspiracy and that fluoridation is a communist plot.</comment>

<comment>Reap what you sow Republicans. You embraced Trump and his birther nonsense when it was Obama.  Did you really think it could never come back and bite you with your own candidates.</comment>

<comment>What you're missing here is that the electorate wants this. While the ruling class is running around asking "how could this happen" the very people who they rely on are rejoicing, because that's what the ruling class told them they should want (and then never really gave them).</comment>

<comment>Trump is not a politician - can everyone agree on that much? He's an actor playing an anti-establishment role. He can say or do anything he wants because he is independently wealthy and is not beholden to any behind closed doors good old boy network - this is where his popularity comes from - he's playing to a huge segment of the American population that is fed up with corruption and cronyism in Washington - it's that simple. The Glenn Beck paranoia that Trump is a rising Hitler is ridiculous - he's as American as apple pie ... He is just as nefarious as any loud mouthed billionaire would be in the same role ...</comment>

<comment>"He can say or do anything he wants because he is independently wealthy and is not beholden to any behind closed doors good old boy network . . . ."Fine, but the problem is, he's yet to articulate, much less propose, any ideas for dealing with the underlying problems.  It would be one thing if he was using his wealth and campaign to affect some fundamental changes, but he's not.  Maybe, at least, use the Scalia replacement issue  to announce that he'd like to appoint a jurist who questions the validity of the Citizen United decision?Otherwise, he's telling voters, "I'll give you a break from the 'old boys network' for four to eight years, but don't worry, I'll leave it there for you when I go.  Unless, of course, you're one of a thousand or so Americans who can afford to do what I do."</comment>

<comment>There it is. Supporters and detractors both focus almost entirely on Trump's outrageous proclomations and empty slogans. Very few seem to notice that the narcissistic, loud-mouthed carney barker says absolutely nothing of any substance whatsoever. He is completely devoid of any serious ideas, but most of the media on both sides of the divide, and his supporters, completely ignore that big, empty hole.</comment>

<comment>Right. I probably deplore Marco Rubio's politics even more than Trump's (partially because I think Rubio believes in what he says), but I watched the debate last night and simultaneously enjoyed the hell out of Rubio's skewering Trump on his lack of policy specifics, and wondered why in the world no one had taken that approach sooner.</comment>

<comment>"Dan Brown-style archeology is not a proper tool of constitutional interpretation"Great line, Professor Epps.</comment>

<comment>What? "Under the Constitution, citizenship is regulated by Congress."  No, not at all.  Under the Constitution, naturalization is regulated by Congress.  Big difference, professor.The birther agrument against Rubio is very different from that against Cruz.  Rubio's depends on fringe scholarship.  Citizens like Cruz, on the other hand, are considered naturalized for Constitutional purposes and the Supreme Court has said so.</comment>

<comment>Cruz was a citizen at birth because his mother was a citizen when he was born.  Naturalized would be something different.  Same as Obama - if he actually were not born in the US.  Where does the Constitution specifically define citizenship?</comment>

<comment>The 14th amendment, but it does not define all citizenship.</comment>

<comment>To be President, all you have to do is be born here. Your parents can be the lowliest of the low, but if you're a child of America you're golden.  What's so hard to understand about that?Professor, Ted Cruz is a naturalized citizen. And SCOTUS says so.  "Naturalization, when used in its constitutional sense, is a generic term describing and including within its meaning all those modes of acquiring American citizenship other than birth in this country. All means of obtaining American citizenship which are dependent upon a congressional enactment are forms of naturalization."-Rogers v Bellei, 1970.Get it? Ted Cruz is by definition _naturalized_.  Not born here = Not eligible.</comment>

<comment>It's a really odd term, "naturalization".  However, there's no Constitutional certainty that someone who is a citizen at birth through "naturalization law" isn't also a natural-born citizen.  John McCain specifically wasn't born in the United States, as he was born in the Panama Canal Zone.  Some believe that his citizenship was defined by 18 USC 1403(a), which granted citizenship to those born there to US citizens.  There's even a good argument that his US citizenship began after he was born, as the law went into effect before he turned one, and the language didn't specify retroactivity (there's confusion about it).</comment>

<comment>"there's no Constitutional certainty that someone who is a citizen at birth through "naturalization law" isn't also a natural-born citizen"  -- Actually there is.  Read the Supreme Court decisions in Wong Kim Ark and Rogers v Bellei, for example.Those cases held that there are two mutually exclusive types of citizenship: natural-born and naturalized.  They also clearly held children born abroad to American citizens to be naturalized citizens.  Therefore such children can't be natural-born.In addition, Congress in 1795 issued a statute that stated children born abroad of citizen parents are citizens only, and deliberately removed any reference to their being natural-born.</comment>

<comment>The holding in  Rogers v. Bellei was about the 14th Amendment.  Since Bellei was neither born nor naturalized in the United States, SCOTUS held that he wasn't a citizen as defined by the 14th Amendment.  They said nothing about his potential eligibility to be President.Yes it had language stating that according to the Constitution, the circumstances of his US citizenship were considered "naturalization", but that doesn't specifically make him ineligible to be a natural-born citizen.</comment>

<comment>Clearly your country has a stupid and confusing law that divides its citizens into two classes: those with stars on their bellies who are eligible to run for president, and those with none upon thars who are not.</comment>

<comment>There's really very little to separate natural-born citizens from those who are not.  The only really difference is for Presidential and Vice-Presidential eligibility. Naturalized citizens have been in important roles as Senators and high-ranking Cabinet members.However, I do appreciate the Dr. Seuss reference.</comment>

<comment>Actually, the natural-born citizen idea is exactly the OPPOSITE of class and caste-based.  It says that anyone born here, of any race or with any shameful parentage, can be president.Compare that to most of the rest of the world where the child has to be of a certain class or caste or race or family blood.  The US is a classless society and the NBS rule reflects that.</comment>

<comment>What "rest of the world" are you talking about? Most countries have no such clause requiring leaders to be natural-born citizens. I think only about one in seven countries have any such requirement.Which means that Americans have two class of citizens, which is what birthers like Trump believe in.</comment>

<comment>Its a kind of weird holdover from the colonial days.In the early days of the US there was lots of fear that European powers would try to take over the US's government directly or indirectly</comment>

<comment>Your not thinking clearly about "natural birth."  It clearly refers to only vaginal birth and therefore any surgical birth (caesarean section) would disqualify you.  Sadly, I am disqualified.Mother's, please think before you act, and keep your children eligible for the Presidency.</comment>

<comment>It's a real trade off, on one had you can't be president but on the other you can kill MacBeth.</comment>

<comment>Congressional law does not trump the Constitutional requirement that a President be a "natural born Citizen." I have no opinion on what "natural born" means, but the term cannot be defined by Congress, we must look to the Constitution for its meaning</comment>

<comment>It's unsettled law.  Unfortunately there are terms in the Constitution that sound vague when read in modern times.  There's no guidance either way whether or not natural born citizen can depend on a Congressional action.Certainly at the time of the Constitution, citizenship was decided by the states.  So it's not as if legislative action wouldn't be important.</comment>

<comment>As with many vague constitutional turns of phrase, it means what most people want it to mean. Like how we don't assign any meaning to the first clause of the second amendment because Americans like to own guns. It's part of what makes originalism such a red herring. Never once has a proponent of originalism concluded that the statutory or constitutional text's original meaning or original intent contradicts what they want it to mean. So, for example, corporations have first amendment rights even though there really wasn't such a thing as corporations (in anything remotely like the modern sense) at the time of the constitutional convention.</comment>

<comment>Sure it can.  the Constitution provides the broad strokes but often law is required to clarify it.</comment>

<comment>Trump: Are my methods unsound?Blitzer: I don't see any method at all, sir.</comment>

<comment>The horror!  The horror!</comment>

<comment>Everyone gets everything they want. We wanted an interesting primary, and for our sins, they gave us one.</comment>

<comment>I'd say that this is a new low for Trump, but his birther smears and innuendo against Obama set the bar pretty low.  If Cruz and Rubio didn't want that particular brand of ugly idiocy to be employed against them, perhaps they should have done a little more to discourage it in the GOP base.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I keep hearing about the bar going lower and lower, but it just seems to be swinging back and forth in place, swishing the manure from one side to the other.</comment>

<comment>Its gratifying to see the birther mud slinging taking over the Republican nomination. Perfect justice.</comment>

<comment>Aint' it cool?The whole Republican S house is going up in flames......</comment>

<comment>At this rate, we're going to see the return of the one drop rule</comment>

<comment>For my part, I'm surprised that Trump hasn't gone about calling Ted Cruz "Rafael" (Cruz's first name) just to make the point more clear. I guess Trump isn't hurting, so why bother, but if he does start losing, expect to see and hear "Rafael" (that most American of names) all over the place.</comment>

<comment>Another article by Mr. Epps ... another complete failure to provide convincing evidence  that Senator Cruz is eligible to be president.Also, the imagined era of exclusion he refers to in the final paragraph is not imaginary.   It stretched from about 1945-1970.   Most refer to it as the Postwar Era (an educated man such as Mr. Epps may have come across the term in print before).   It was indeed a golden era for the American worker and, lo and behold, rates of legal and illegal immigration were much lower then than they are now.   You can fool some of the people some of the time ...</comment>

<comment>I appreciate that the rate of new illegal immigration has slowed dramatically since 2008.  The number of illegal immigrants currently inside the U.S. is still much higher today than it was during the Postwar Period.</comment>

<comment>Blaming Trump for 'spreading lies' is like blaming all Nazi atrocities on Hitler.  People believe what they want to believe if it means they can get first dibs on waterboarding and punching people in the face.  Or at least accusing them of 'spreading lies about our dear leader' which is a form of 'cyber bullying' under newly nationalized 'hate speech' legislation (thanks, Christie).</comment>

<comment>There are two qualifications for president:1- Citizenship - regulated by Congress2- "Natural born" - vaginal birth.

It clearly refers to only vaginal birth and therefore any surgical birth (caesarean section) would disqualify you. Sadly, I am disqualified.Mothers, please think before you act, and keep your children eligible for the Presidency.</comment>

<comment>Isn't "natural" childbirth the kind where there are no drugs, often performed in a bathtub or somesuch? In that case, if Mr. Trump cannot produce a birth certificate indicating the he was born in a bathtub, to a mother who had not taken an epidural, he is ineligible.</comment>

<comment>When an esteemed law professor says there might be a Constitutional issue, maybe there is!  It's weird that the author doesn't even look at Tribe's arguments but just dismisses them as libel.</comment>

<comment>Nobody has said that Tribe's arguments are libel.  In fact Tribe has an extremely nuanced view, which is partially derived from a wish to "stick it" to Cruz since Cruz views himself as a Constitutional originalist and decries "activist judges".  Tribe says that his views of a "living Constitution" would allow that times have changed and that we understand that older understandings may not work in modern society.Certainly at the time of the Constitution, the main view of derivation of citizenship outside of the nation was of patrilineal descent - namely that citizenship derived from the father.  If Cruz was consistent on his viewpoint he would acknowledge that.Certainly Trump says whatever he feels boosts his visibility.  That's why he talks so much about Obama and his alleged birth outside the US.</comment>

<comment>"Nobody has said that Tribe's arguments are libel."Did you read the title of this article?</comment>

<comment>Sure.  The title is "Trump's Birther Libel".Read.  Carefully.</comment>

<comment>Seems counterproductive and hypocritical to legalistically accuse someone of 'libel' for saying things that challenge the Constitution.  Why?  Think about it.</comment>

<comment>Even assuming that Trump's claims have no legal validity to them, that still doesn't make them "libel." "Libel" is "the action of damaging the good reputation of someone in writing." Being ineligible to run for president because of some quirk in the Constitution does NOT mean you have a bad reputation.</comment>

<comment>I think one could reasonably argue that it is libel per se, a category of statements including statements which "relate to the person's business or profession, to the person's detriment."</comment>

<comment>Here is an interesting take on Cruz's eligibility by an incredibly accomplished constitutional law professor at UVA, who examined the question in 2009 in relation to Obama's eligibility for the presidency. According to what he writes, Ted Cruz is not eligible for the presidency because he was not born abroad to two American citizens. Compellingly, it considers the question without reference to Ted Cruz, whose eligibility hadn't yet come up. http://www.law.virginia.edu/ht...</comment>

<comment>The real irony here is that Epps gives no evidence for his conclusion (with which I agree) that Cruz is eligible. This is what frustrates me so much about how the media confront Trump: His wildly inaccurate claims are met (not universally, but usually) with the assertion that they're racist or unseemly or ungentlemanly, and it's all left at that.I usually enjoy Epps's writing, but if you're not going to give us the constitutional case for why Tribe is wrong, don't criticize Tribe for asserting without evidence that Trump is right. </comment>

<comment>IMO Epps doesn't give evidence because there is so little.  Most people with Epps's view rely on the Naturalization Act of 1790 and (try to) ignore the fact that it was resoundingly rescinded in 1795.I recommend this superb (and highly evidenced) article: http://www.salon.com/2016/01/2...</comment>

<comment>The people who wrote the constitution would not have considered either Cruz or Rubio eligible for president.  They are naturalized citizens not natural born citizens.As for Obama....he still has been unable to actually produce a full physical birth certificate.  The best he came up with was a pdf file.  And If I were to apply for a passport with a PDF file they would tell me to go back and get a real one.I assume the reason he keeps it secret is that it lists his religion as muslim which was his father's religion not that he was not born in Hawaii</comment>

<comment>Persons who acquire US citizenship by birth in the United States, like Rubio, are by no rational understanding of the term naturalized citizens.  They are and have always been natural born citizens.How, exactly, would one put "a full physical birth certificate" on the internet?Putting aside the fact that Obama has gone to unprecedented lengths to release his birth records to the public, are you really as dumb as you'd have to be to make such an inane assumption as that one about "the reason he keeps it secret"?</comment>

<comment>Of course he didn't keep it secret.  Factcheck was given access to a perfectly fine certified copy.  The big mystery is why no one other than Savannah Guthrie bothered to examine it.  I thought maybe WND had someone who did, but didn't they dump him for not toeing the company line?</comment>

<comment>I forget.  I haven't been keeping up with them since they banned me.</comment>

<comment>Rubio, was naturalized:Ted Cruz is a Naturalized Citizen thorugh Naturalization act 8 USC 1401 (g) and Rubio is a Naturalized citizen through act 8 USC 1401 (a).Supreme Court Rulings:Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U.S. 815 (1971)"Although those Americans who acquire their citizenship under statutes conferring citizenship on the foreign-born children of citizens are not popularly thought of as naturalized citizens, the use of the word "naturalize" in this way has a considerable constitutional history. Congress is empowered by the Constitution to "establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization," Art. I, § 8. Anyone acquiring citizenship solely under the exercise of this power is, constitutionally speaking, a naturalized citizen1+1+1+1=4(1) Congress was given powers ONLY to create uniform rules for Naturalization+(1) Naturalization the man made process defined:Naturalization (or naturalisation) is the legal act or process by which a non-citizen in a country may acquire citizenship or nationality of that country.

<comment>8 USC 1401(a) is merely the codification of the 14th Amendment's citizenship clause.  It's not an exercise of Congress's power to naturalize.  It's just plain silly to say that it is.</comment>

<comment>Yes and no, it codifies congresses naturalization laws regarding naturalized citizen and applies it to the 14th. Note the codified law has no category for natural born citizens - child born to citizen parents on us soil or jurisdiction.</comment>

<comment>That's pretty much gibberish.</comment>

<comment>The writers of the Constitution would have considered those of African or Asian ancestry to not be US citizens at all.  We've come a long way.Obama had a real birth certificate that most definitely could have been used to get a passport.  Many have gotten a passport with Hawaii's "short form".  It and the "long form" exist as real certified paper copies.  Factcheck was given access to it.  NBC's White House reporter even handled the "long form" and took a couple of photos.  Neither existed merely as PDFs.http://www.factcheck.org/2008/...http://www.nbcnews.com/video/n...Also - Hawaiian birth certificates have never listed religion.</comment>

<comment>Obama's lawyers had something that looked kind of like it might be a real birth certificate, but it was never used in any legal action, and Hawaii failed to confirm the authenticity of the JPGs, PDFs and alleged long-form.</comment>

<comment>The point of Trump's issue is not that someone isn't a US citizen, it's that they're not "natural born citizens".  Congress may determine who can be a US citizen...BUT the US Constitution spells out that only a "natural born citizen" can be President of the USA.  There is a difference.  When delegates to the Constitutional Convention gathered in 1787, they did not qualify “natural born citizen” merely to protect the presidency from foreign intrigue. Clearly, they felt that “natural born” meant being born within the boundaries of states but also possessing a deep love of soil and manners unique to the United States. This is why the framers made an allowance for anyone naturalized at the time of the Constitution’s drafting. A naturalized foreigner acquired full citizenship and could stand for president based on having supported the Revolution––why Caribbean-born Alexander Hamilton could have run. He had displayed ardor and allegiance during the war. “Natural born” was added because it insured an unwavering identification, presumably ingrained from birth.The wording of Article II on presidential qualifications explicitly divides the population into two eligible groups: those natural born and those naturalized before 1787. Only members of the Revolutionary generation, risking all (their lives and property) were eligible for the highest executive office.What’s more, American law did not endorse dual citizenship until recently. This is why the 1855 statute cited above automatically made into U.S. citizens foreign-born women who married U.S. citizens––citizenship earned through the fact of marriage. Yet foreign-born men who married U.S.-born women were not, on that basis, granted citizenship. Men had to be naturalized, prove their residency, and over time demonstrate eligibility for citizenship.At the time of the Constitution, then, what mattered was whether the father was a citizen.  This law has NEVER been changed.Persons naturalized before the Constitution’s ratification were eligible for office on the same terms as native Americans; but “persons adopted [into the country] thereafter were permanently barred from the presidency–­–the only explicit constitutional limitation on their potential rights.” That the framers made this their sole exclusion indicates that it was an important provision.To say that “natural born citizen” is settled law is nothing more than a rhetorical ploy.The question of whether a person born abroad of one American and one alien parent “qualifies as natural born” remains unresolved.</comment>

<comment>Sure it's unsettled law, but the Constitution has been amended and it's been established that the Equal Protection Clause can also apply to the federal government.  At this point, would natural-born only through the father be considered equal protection?</comment>

<comment>In other words, censor Trump's speech and suppress his ideas.  No one should question the meaning of "natural born citizen" even though this important concept limits who may run for President.  Don't ask if a person such as Cruz who was born and lived in Canada for years and was a citizen of Canada for decades can be considered a "natural born citizen" of the United States.  Yet it is known that this clause in the Constitution was intent on preventing foreign individuals unfamiliar with the United States Constitution due to their foreign birth and upbringing from becoming President which a President is sworn and duty bound to  defend.But as Trump has argued only a court can definitively rule on whether or not a candidate is "natural born citizen" eligible to be President.  This is not automatic or self evident in all cases especially in M. Cruz's case.</comment>

<comment>To equate all three of these as "birther" libels is grossly mischaracterizing the arguments. What was done to Obama is on a whole other plain: it's not just that they were arguing that he was born elsewhere and thus ineligible: they were arguing that he had employed a massive conspiracy from birth to trick people -- essentially a sleeper cell terrorist from birth.What is happening to Cruz is a very legitimate debate about the meaning of "natural born citizen" which is used very distinctly from "citizen" -- not dissimilar to an argument over the meaning of "well regulated militia."Nobody is actually making the argument that Rubio isn't eligible. That is clearly thrown in to make the authors crapulent argument hold together. The Atlantic is increasingly like Salon with every passing day. This is not a compliment. What dross.</comment>

<comment>There have been a fringe that claim that a natural-born citizen must be born to two US citizen parents, even if native-born.  There have been suits attempting to declare Rubio ineligible.  The same has happened for Jindal and Obama.</comment>

<comment>Your enemy's enemy is your friend.  That is Trump's strategy in a nutshell.  Many Americans are pissed off at someone, and see more enemies around them than friends.  Hence, the more people Trump can make his enemy, the more friends he gains.  That's why he takes a potshot at someone new each day.</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court guide to why Ted Cruz is not eligible in three easy steps:A) Luria v. United States: "Under our Constitution, a naturalized citizen stands on an equal footing with the native citizen in all respects save that of eligibility to the presidency."B) U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark: "A person born out of the jurisdiction of the United States can only become a citizen by being naturalized" including "foreign-born children of citizens."C) Rogers v. Bellei: " As shown in Wong Kim Ark, naturalization, when used in its constitutional sense, is a generic term describing and including within its meaning all those modes of acquiring American citizenship other than birth in this country.  All means of obtaining American citizenship which are dependent upon a congressional enactment are forms of naturalization."Ted Cruz > born out of the jurisdiction > citizen by congressional enactment > naturalized > ineligible for the presidency</comment>

<comment>And you pieces of ....media, need to be tried for treason...Rogers v.

Though what we can do though as plants of garden Z is create some "plant made rules" that states plants born in another garden to a plant of garden Z do indeed have some ties to our garden and thus can be considered "plants of garden z"-Naturalized Plants (not natural born plants) and as such are welcome to garden Z and enjoy the rights of garden Z, except one of course.</comment>
