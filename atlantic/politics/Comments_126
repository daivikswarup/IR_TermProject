<comment>1. First of all there are many, many serious terrorist incidents that have been committed by Islamic refugees in the USA.  I don't know - can somebody out there count them up?Here is one list :http://www.wnd.com/2015/11/big...Here is another completely different list I found randomly - which has Muslim as well as non-Muslim terror attacks. I don't even think that the two lists overlap.Plenty of attacks by refugees on this list:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...No doubt people can find more lists - I only spent 30 seconds doing this.No doubt liberals will point to people like McVeigh, some cases of domestic terrorism.So the logic is that - because we have SOME domestic attacks - we should make things WORSE by bringing in foreign terrorists.2. Obama and progressives have been ignoring the fact that ISIS promised to slip terrorists into the refugee stream and kept their promise with the Paris attacks.Note that Obama is doubling down on his insane mission of bringing in unvetted refugees.Both the Homeland Security director AND the FBI have told Congress that they have no way of guaranteeing that refugees are not terrorists.  Basically, they do interviews - asking the refugees questions like :  'Are you a terrorist?". Questions like that. I am not kidding.3. Even non-terrorist Islamic refugees bring the real risk of having children become radicalized. That's EXACTLY what happened with Major Hassan, the Fort Hood massacre jihadi.</comment>

<comment>Spud, your "evidence" doesn't show remotely what you claim it does. Providing long lists of (mostly unsuccessful) terrorist plots -- committed by many different types of terrorists -- doesn't add up to an argument against admitting Syrian refugees. You've basically proven terrorists are bad, and want to do us harm. Thanks for the news.</comment>

<comment>1. The fact that some of the plots were foiled is not evidence to support lunatic progressive plans to bring in more potential terrorists.2. No - the news is that you progressives are lying when you say that refugees don't do terrorism.Ask yourself why believing in fiction is so important to your worldview.It is irrational, and borderline mentally ill.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. Many of these plots were foiled with the help of Muslims -- informants, members of our security agencies (it's true!). So demonizing every Muslim as a "potential terrorist" is counter-productive and actually makes us less safe.But I don't think your goal is Americans' safety. It's doing your part for the holy war.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. Most were not foiled by Muslims. Keep the propaganda rolling, progressive tool.</comment>

<comment>You have no idea what you're talking about obviously.</comment>

<comment>And you keep playing into the hands of the terrorists, Spud.</comment>

<comment>You sure do.</comment>

<comment>Did you ever hear of the Chatanooga recruiting shooting deaths of four Americans?  How about the Boston Marathon bombs?  Both were committed by refugees</comment>

<comment>We don't want ANY of their plots to be successful.Do you really want to see ISIS Barbarians raping your sister or your wife or your mother?Do you really want to see ISIS Barbarians beheading your friend or your brother or father?Do you really want to see ISIS Barbarians literally crucifying one of your Christian friends?</comment>

<comment>Everyone wants to help the refugees, but we have different ways of going about it.We send over $4 Billion dollars to Arab nations for Humanitarian Aid.  They should be taking the refugees, it makes more sense than dragging them around the world only to experience culture shock when they get here.Some of the Syrian refugees sent to other countries (Finland and other Norwegian countries), hated it so much they wanted to go back to Syria.</comment>

<comment>Guess I havent been here in awhile lol. The answer to your reply is the Gulf States not only help fund and provide medical aid to refugees but they do take them in. The reason their numbers arent shown is because they are not signed with the UNHRC, the United Nations refugee program which keeps track of numbers. Saudi Arabia reports that the Gulf States have taken in 2.5 million refugees. The Arab nations around Syria are getting overwhelmed which is why you see hear about refugees taking to rubber rafts out in the ocean trying to find countries that will take them in.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is demonizing Muslims.   Why can't Leftists distinguishRadical Islam... from normal Muslims?   Leftists are the ones with the problem!Or is it deliberate?</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, you have evidence that the Syrian refugees under discussion here are violent, radical Muslims? Maybe you could share that with us.</comment>

<comment>Paris police have evidence.  The fingerprints matched of one of the ISIS attackers in Paris, with 1 of the 198 refugees who arrived in Greece on Oct. 3rd.</comment>

<comment>It's confirmed that his Syrian passport was fake: http://www.wsj.com/articles/pa...</comment>

<comment>The fake passport story doesn't mean what you think it means.  The fake passport was still the one used by the terrorist to enter with the refugees.The fact the document was not real doesn't mean anything if it was used effectively to claim refugee status and enter a country.There are stories of people selling passports at the beach in Syria so even many legitimate refugees are using fake passports.</comment>

<comment>Even worse. Apparently there are lots of fake Syrian passports floating around Europe currently being used by infiltrators to gain access to countries under the guise of being a favored Syrian refugee.</comment>

<comment>And you know for a fact not one is?</comment>

<comment>He is not 'demonizing' every Muslim.Perhaps you might have supported bringing 65,000 young male Nazis to the U.S. in the summer of 1941.  After all, they wouldn't all be bad.</comment>

<comment>"Why should we let these German refugees in? Sure, they claim to be Jewish, but how do we know some of them aren't really Nazi saboteurs?"</comment>

<comment>Your 'progressive' President FDR refused to let those Jews in.  You obviously missed the point.</comment>

<comment>And he sent Japanese Americans  to internment camps. I'm perfectly fine with discussing the shortcomings and failures of past historical figures, even ones that I think did good things on the whole, because I don't feel the need to idolize them, or engage in hero worship. He did do a lot of good things, but it's not an all or nothing deal.I don't need to pretend that GWBush/Reagan/whomever could do no wrong, nor to make excuses for them. For that matter, there are things I'm critical of Obama on, too, even though I voted for him twice. I also don't need to demonize them unnecessarily, either - there are things that Bush, Reagan, and even Nixon did that were good, intelligent, necessary, and that I would commend them for - though that doesn't mean I see them as a net positive, especially next to another alternative.The benefit of knowing and understanding history is hindsight. It lets us judge what others did right, as well as where they made mistakes in the past, so that we may better avoid them in the future. Those who ignore it, or fail to learn from it, tend to do far worse.</comment>

<comment>Nice comment.  Indeed all political leaders bring us a mixture of good and bad results.  Often results which are considered to be beneficial in the short term turn out to be negative in the long term and visa versa.One comment on the mention of the internment of Japanese in WWII.  Germans and Italians were also interned, so internment did not have as much of a racial taint as Zinn would have those being 'educated' believe.  Having said that, it's no doubt true that Japanese were considered more 'foreign' than Germans or Italians because they were far fewer in number.</comment>

<comment>They were also far more noticeable, and tended to be entirely first or second generation immigrants due to restrictions on earlier settlement. By comparison, there had been large numbers of German and Italian immigrants, going back as far as the mid 1800s at least in terms of Germans, so you'd have less of a case of "round them all up."Was it solely based on racial animus? No - but that doesn't mean it wasn't tainted by it, or make it any less of a shameful episode in our history.</comment>

<comment>And there were only between 600 and 900 on the U.S.S. St. Louis that neither Cuba, who promised to let them in, and then FDR who also wouldn't let them.  Ship went back to Europe; most wound up in concentration camps.  When this guy in the WH talks letting in 10,000 completely undocumented "refugees" this fiscal year, he is opening up the U. S. to people about whom we know nothing because no way, shape or form can they be vetted.  I don't care what kind of propaganda is being put out by Progressives and the Church Services Organization.</comment>

<comment>That analogy would apply to Syrian Christians, not to Muslims. Muslims are the equivalent of Nazis.</comment>

<comment>Muslims arent one group. Just like Protestants, Catholics they can really hate each other.If Sharia law and domination of the West was their goal the Taliban have had to take such extreme measures to control their population. They would be unified instead of fractured. If they were unified 9/11 wouldnt have been 19 people mainly from one country but literal hordes of people.It's more than annoying to see you paint 1.6 billion with such broad strokes when I doubt you could say the 5 pillars of islam (or the ten commandments) without looking them up.</comment>

<comment>First of all, what a ridiculous little snoot you are. Second, there were intra-Nazi quarrels rather similar to the ones among Mohammedans. Ever heard of the Night of the Long Knives? Just like being a Nazi, being a a Muslim is a choice. Specifically, it's a choice to adhere to an evil ideology, which in both cases just happens to call for the extermination of the Jews and subjugation of the Christians.</comment>

<comment>??</comment>

<comment>"Perhaps you might have supported bringing 65,000 young male Nazis to the U.S. in the summer of 1941.  After all, they wouldn't all be bad."How about saving Jewish refugee children from the nazis? You have a hypothetical. I have an actual poll among Americans from 1939.http://i68.tinypic.com/t69h6c....So how many of those 10,000 do you think ended up in the showers?</comment>

<comment>Deus vault</comment>

<comment>Lol Spud you are the biggest coward on the internet - maybe you should hide under the bed so the big bad refugees don't scare you. Lol.  Wa wa wa.And yes, we're proudly welcoming refugees - I actually live in a place that has been hit by terrorists 20 block from my home at the time, known people who died and now in a Jewish neighborhood to boot. And we're glad to help, to stick together because this is how you win the long game - not by succumbing to cowardly fear and wallowing in ignorance, thinking it will keep you safe.Because being a knee jerk wuss is exactly what ISIS expects and hopes for from easily manipulated hater yahoos like you - they've said as much and made it clear. You're their strategic ideal, congratulations (although not remotely surprising)! God forbid you think past your adolescent emotionality and in to strategy.These refugees have an incredibly onerous process of analysis done before they ever set foot here, this before they even begin the process of applying for US refugee status, which is among the toughest in the Western world.But don't worry, we won't tell the scary ones where you're hiding under your bed. For God's sake man up. Lol.</comment>

<comment>Not all refugees are equal.Taking refugees from Syria, which is a Jihadist Factory....is INSANITY.I have Syrian relatives who've lived in the U.S. for decades now, and they think Obama is OUT OF HIS MIND taking refugees at this point in time.</comment>

<comment>Oh PLEASE. You do realize that ISIS is murdering more MUSLIMS than anyone else?http://www.independent.co.uk/n...For god's sake, they are crucifying KIDS! And you want to hide under your bed and pretend it's not happening? Then what??? When the smoke clears and the mass graves are unearthed, you and your right-wing friends will be the FIRST ONES to claim you "didn't know"... Just like the cowards who refused terrified Jews trying to flee from the Nazis.As for your shite about "leftists"... Let's not forget that ISIS was created thanks to the NEOCONS who invaded IRAQ. The blood is on YOUR hands, not ours.</comment>

<comment>ISIS was created when Obama pulled all our troops out of Iraq in 2011..</comment>

<comment>Perhaps, but we never should have had troops there in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Two Wrongs, don't make a right, either.</comment>

<comment>No there you are wrong. Salafi always existed. Once Bush invaded Iraq he destabilized the region and unleashed them</comment>

<comment>ISIS was created 1400 years ago. </comment>

<comment>We pay the Arab Nations $4 Billlion Dollars for Humanitarian Aid... why can't Obama convince those  nations to step-up and take the refugees--- instead of removing them from their homeland and their culture?</comment>

<comment>pretty sure the blood is on the terrorists hands</comment>

<comment>No Isis was created by your darling Obamba pulling the troops out of Iraq</comment>

<comment>Yes she realizes that. Muslims are terrified of daesh. They do not want even one of them getting by.</comment>

<comment>How do you even trust your Syrian relatives man? Maybe they're all terrorists too :0</comment>

<comment>Jill - you are a coward, because you are too scared to stand up for American values.As far as the "vetting" which you are ignorant about - even the Atlantic has an article showing that most Syrian passports are fake.In addition :http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/16/...FBI Director James Comey hit on the issue at a congressional hearing last month, when he told lawmakers, "If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them."</comment>

<comment>Stand up for American values?  Go back to hiding under the bed, you're delusional.  We'll go back to doing what the statue of liberty says.  Derp.</comment>

<comment>Tell that to the Leftist's who need "safe spaces" because they can't even handle certain "words".</comment>

<comment>Statute.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...sorry, couldn't resist.</comment>

<comment>American values? American values don't apply a religious test to entrance.</comment>

<comment>Nice try. We can use a nationality test as a perfectly adequate test.</comment>

<comment>Really ?  Obama has just criticized the notion of bringing at risk Christian refugees from the Syrian conflict to the U.S.  Evidently it is acceptable for them to be slaughtered in place.</comment>

<comment>All the people opposed to ISIS are at risk. You're just proposing picking the winners and losers based on your personal prejudices.</comment>

<comment>'Progressivism' at its best !  I have no personal preferences so that accusation is false - you had no basis to suggest it.  The 'personal prejudices' being demonstrated in this event are those of the leftists which are arguing that refugees of one religion are welcome when refugees of another are not - and the suggestion that they should be is ridiculed.You accused me of a perspective which Obama has demonstrated.</comment>

<comment>Obama has suggested there be no religious test. You are suggesting we implement a religious test or complaining that we do not have a religious test.</comment>

<comment>Yes, his doubletalk suggested that there be no religious test, yet he ridicules the notion that persecuted Christians be admitted as refugees."You are suggesting we implement a religious test or complaining that we do not have a religious test.  Blatently false.</comment>

<comment>Christians are a tiny minority in Syria.  That's one reasonChristians are a target of ISIS. That's another reason.However, they need to be seriously vetted and verified before they are allowed to enter the U.S.And then we have to monitor them and track them while they're here.</comment>

<comment>That's really a perversion of what he said.  He criticized using a religious test to admit refugees or to distinguish one refugee from another, not the notion of bringing any at risk group to the US in particular.</comment>

<comment>Right, and most everyone would reject a religious test.This is what he does so well, and amazingly so many people nod their head and agree.  Nobody suggested a religious test.  Critics simply argue that the Christians, who are also being massacred, should be given equal consideration ... the notion of which he belittled.He has also suggested that his critics are scared of women and children when they raise issues regarding the questionable quality of any vetting which might be performed.  Really ?  Isn't that a little childish ?Or to state that the Republicans couldn't handle Putin or others if they couldn't even handle the moderators in that debate.  Great sophomoric (but false) soundbite to ridicule his political opponents and probably influence his supporters, especially those which were clueless to the fact that the candidates got the best of those moderators and made a public display of the constant bias and disservice to the public by such moderators as them, Candy, Georgie, etc.Clintwood was right, it's an empty chair.</comment>

<comment>No, he resisted the idiotic GOP notion of blanket-denying all refugees asylum.</comment>

<comment>Really ??What law says that we can NOT discriminate about the people the US lets in ?The US laws protect the people already here.Not the ones on the outside wanting inAnd DEFINITELY NOT those wanting in to cause mayhem</comment>

<comment>American values are great, but we also have to put the safety of American citizens first.</comment>

<comment>Right. We should put that right up there with "When the going gets tough, the cowards throw away their ideals."</comment>

<comment>Its a matter of Priority, that's all it is.Christians are a tiny Minority in Syria;Christians are hated by ISIS,  beheaded by ISIS....</comment>

<comment>American values are not a suicide pact.</comment>

<comment>Except for progressives, who seem intent on doing everything they can to become lemmings.</comment>

<comment>You're arguing your case with facts, or at worst purported facts.  Jill, like most 'progressives', counters your argument with slurs.My favorite is the reference to the words at the statue of liberty.  Where on that site does it say, "Give us your terrorists"?</comment>

<comment>You argued zero facts, only biases and you just didn't like my facts.When you learn to actually think critically, let's chat.  Otherwise, go back to the fear mongers and know nothings. Good bye.</comment>

<comment>You know, only a couple of hours after Obama mocked Republicans for being "scared of widows" - one of the Islamic widows of an  ISIS Paris attacker detonated her suicide vest as the French police came calling.</comment>

<comment>And yesterday at a soccer match in Turkey, the 'moment of silence' was filled with loud noise and catcalls, and followed by a rousing roars of 'Allahu Akbar'.Even CBS reported this - the worm is turning.  Might we be witnessing the beginning of the end of the leftist control of the Democrat party ?http://www.cbsnews.com/news/tu...</comment>

<comment>When a jihadist beheads a progressive, his last words are usually somethinglike "F*ck Rush Limbaugh!".</comment>

<comment>Right, we should be totally afraid of women who blow themselves up when they understand the police want to question them.</comment>

<comment>Very good points.People like spud who are either cowards or bigots or both don't blink an eye at the annual number of people killed with guns in the US, which is a FAR larger number than lives lost to terrorism here, but this, they deem way more dangerous.</comment>

<comment>Shhhh. You're scaring him. He doesn't like scary things.</comment>

<comment>Way to go with that straw man !  Here's another:  cars kill far more people in this country than guns, so shouldn't cars be illegal ?</comment>

<comment>No, it wasn't.'It means, stop allowing yourself to be manipulated - by politicians or terrorist thugs.If you're at all demonizing refugees for fear of something they might do, it's just stupid. That's why I posted the odds - to show in stark relief exactly how stupid it is.</comment>

<comment>I also demonize rapists and murders ... that's why we don't tolerate them in our midst.Again, you misstate ... "at all demonizing refugees".  Perhaps you should follow your own advice in not allowing yourself to be manipulated.  You have already read my words which suggest that it's a small minority of the refugees who are jihadists ?  Was that comment not understood ?</comment>

<comment>I'm not following what exactly your point it.  Can you tell me exactly how small that minority of terrorist refugees is?  No, you can't because you're making things up.If you're really advocating that we not allow in any refugees because of some mythical maybe in some made up minority, my point is that yours is not a logical position to take based on many facts I already posted.</comment>

<comment>Quite silly to accuse me of 'making things up' when I am acknowledging that it would only be a few of the 'Syrian refugees' are currently jihadists.</comment>

<comment>So long as the vetting process is in place, then sure, be my guest (well, not literally).The question always is, though, how airtight is said process? If these people can't be identified, that's a major problem.</comment>

<comment>There's no guarantees in life, but that's a perfectly fair point,</comment>

<comment>You really are stupid,</comment>

<comment>LOL This thread is cracking me up. The disconnect of "American values" from people is mind boggling. "Christian values..." "American values..." Somehow those values became defined by the antithesis of their original intention. We are a country of religiously persecuted immigrants. Is there something more American than that?All of that aside. Isis is getting exactly what they want right now. Scared Americans deviating from their lives and normal routines, abandoning their history, values and morals in lieu of security. Marking a line in the sand between Islam and the rest of the world. That essentially is way more damaging than risking a 2 years stay in a refugee camp just to sneak in an operative or two. And that's while disregarding that we have about 4000 miles of open borders that anyone can sneak in at any time. Pretty naive to think that there aren't already terrorists here.Jill has it pretty spot on. Pull up your big boy/girl pants and play the long game, because you areprematurely resorting to base instincts by waving your dick at 10,000 desperate refugees (many of which are children) displaced by the same assholes you are so fearful of.</comment>

<comment>Driven by fear at the exact time when we should be driven by resolve. But then again -- look at the surreal spectacle a year ago when everyone was losing their collective sh!t over the Ebola outbreak. After that, nothing really surprises me.</comment>

<comment>You must be severely warped to imagine that by stopping ISIS members, you are doing what ISIS wants.You need to put on your big-boy pants and start sticking up for American values instead of being a doormat for Islamic domination.You need to learn about the long game - it is almost Orwellian how you could accuse me of that, since it is EXACTLY your main fault.</comment>

<comment>Who could possibly argue with a sound argument like that?</comment>

<comment>ISIS is infiltrating the Western World,  that's what they're doing.Easier to attack that way.And, they're playing mind games which they know the Leftistswill fall for.</comment>

<comment>Apparently you didn't bother to read the article. Why do trolls think anyone wants to absorb their paranoia?You know, It really helps to read the article! Then, if you can cite LEGITIMATE SOURCES as EVIDENCE** you are more than welcome to add a contrary perspective. (**I don't mean snippets from WND, or Breitbart, or lifesitenews, or any other far-right agitprop, either).However, when you open with inflammatory language such as "lunatic progressive plans", you shout out to everyone that you have no point(s) worth considering.</comment>

<comment>Yet you did read my post - since you KNOW that I have something worth saying.  Another clue might be the quantity of upvotes.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who relies on WingNutDaily has no point.Upvotes? You seriously think you can weigh the validity of a point by the upvotes? Are you blind to how popular Hitler was? You right wingers are delusional. You wouldn't know fact if it bit your nose off.</comment>

<comment>You and Hitler had a lot in common. You both support Islamic extremism.</comment>

<comment>ISIS promised to infiltrate those Syrian Refugees and they delivered their promise off course.The French terrorists attacks showed they done it with success and it is not a big surprise.Off course, they already infiltrated more inside those Syrian Refugees and there are at least  a couple on those 10 000 Syrian Refugees who entered New-Orleans a couple days ago.Off course ISIS does that.. what are people expecting? What a wonderful opportunity!Boston Marathon bombings were done by Refugees...</comment>

<comment>Boston Bombers were refugees.  Russia even warned the U.S. about them, but out government ignored Russia.</comment>

<comment>Feel free to live your life in fear. The odds of you being it by a bus are incalculably higher than ever being harmed, let alone killed by a terrorist.Personally, I have no interest in living that way, it's a total waste and will never keep you safe. I also refuse to be manipulated by terrorist thugs and know that this type of amorphous fear that causes people to attack people based on their religion, perceived religion or refugee status is exactly the wet dream of these thugs.No thank you.  You live your life in fear and pleasing terrorists. I will not.</comment>

<comment>Its not fear at all. Its being Pro-active and Preventing anotherParis Slaughter from occurring.Liberals seem to be missing the Pro-Active  gene.  They seem to just live in denial.  Some seem to believe Paris Slaughter didn't happen.   Its like they're living in their own world.</comment>

<comment>No - you're in denial, I watched the twin towers burn out my window.  I know exactly what I'm doing.The fact is, you lack the personal courage and honesty gene.  Pro active to what?  Being scared and living your life in fear of what MIGHT happen?The odds of dying in your bathtub are so much higher than the big bad guys ever even getting near you. For Gods sake, stop being such an easily cowed and manipulated sheep.</comment>

<comment>No, no, no.  When you're actively doing something to prevent bad things from happening, it makes you stronger and more confident.   That's not fear at all.Leftists are the Scaredy-Cats.   Leftists need "safe spaces" in order to cope with the real world.</comment>

<comment>Oh so now it's time to dodge the issue.Nice try baaaaa baaaaa baaaaa.  Fearful sheeple, I hear the orphans are the scariest.  We won't tell them where you live lol.(and I knew that Syrian family shtick was total horse manure).</comment>

<comment>I do have Syrian relatives and I absolutely know more about Syria than you ever will.</comment>

<comment>And the GOP thinks that invading any and every country we have a beef with is a sound foreign policy. We spent trillions and sent thousands of Americans to their deaths to take out Saddam Hussein. Do you feel safe?</comment>

<comment>And letting thousands on the terrorist watch list buy guns, effing brainless morons.http://www.nydailynews.com/new...</comment>

<comment>We all felt safer until 0bama removed the stabilizing force in Iraq and tipped the balance in favor of ISILISIL- the group of rebels in Syria that 0bama and Hillary smuggled weapons to from Benghazi.http://www.thefederalistpapers...http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</comment>

<comment>George Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement that put a deadline on troops there partly because that was what Iraq demanded. That's history.</comment>

<comment>Since when is any president constrained by the actions of the previous one?ISIL also was seriously gaining traction by that time and 0bama could have made a case on that alone. But he wanted out! And we are up to our necks in it worse because of it.</comment>

<comment>And Obama, as President, was free to renegotiate it, or rescind it.</comment>

<comment>The Iraq government asked us to leave. It wasn't like Obama just flipped a coin.</comment>

<comment>He just gave in like a wuss.Not to mention leaving the Kurds, pretty much helpless and defenseless.</comment>

<comment>Yes, watching the twin towers event gives the viewer infinite wisdom.  Do you drive without seatbelts ?</comment>

<comment>derp. what a stupid thing to say lol.The odds are one in 200,000 million that you will die in a terrorist attack.  Every time you get in a car, your odds of dying in it are 1 in 470But do tell me why I should thrill a bunch of terrorist thugs by demonizing people running from war.</comment>

<comment>You inferred that with the 'from my window' comment.  ;-)Nobody is 'demonizing' people running from war.  Except perhaps the small numbers of them which are willing jihadists.</comment>

<comment>Ok, my mistake, my apologies.  I misunderstood you.I'm sorry also, I just find it so stupid to think a terrorist would bother going through the really complicated process of applying to be a refugee (many of whom are already on watch lists), when all they'd have to is buy a plane ticket.  Sure, it could happen, but I'm not going to waste time worrying about it.  I could die in a car every time I step in, those odds are pretty high. But I'm not dwelling on it.It's a time to THINK, not be used. Logic is our friend.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, folks should start thinking.</comment>

<comment>Here's why ISIS would pose as "refugees":ISIS's goal is to infiltrate the Western World;Its a Lot cheaper to come here as a refugee than buy a plane ticket;they know where to get Fake Syrian Passports;"American blood is sweetest"</comment>

<comment>Terrorists coming as refugees would be a victory that they could hoodwink us and use our benevolence against us.This war is a THOUSAND years in the making. They're in it for the long game.</comment>

<comment>I have a bucket of gumballs. Only 10% are poisoned. How many do you want?</comment>

<comment>Excellent analogy..</comment>

<comment>It's proactive to shoot yourself in the head to prevent cancer. That doesn't make it a good way to prevent cancer.</comment>

<comment>"The odds of you being killed by X are massively higher than ever being harmed by a terrorist".That argument holds water because there are so many things being paid for in order to proactively keep terrorists out. It isn't because "oh, those terrorists just don't want to come here because it's too far, lawlz".</comment>

<comment>B. S.   They only "scaredy-cats" I know of are the Leftist's whoneed "safe spaces"  in order to cope with real life.</comment>

<comment>I bet you lock your doors on your house and car. Is that fear or just the simple logic of 'don't invite trouble'?</comment>

<comment>The Boston Bombers weren't refugees. Their families weren't subjected to the vetting process Syrian refugees would be.</comment>

<comment>The Washington Post on Apr 13, 2013 reported that the Boston bombers were in fact refugees.The Huffington Post (among lots of others on the propaganda bandwagon) muddles the issue yesterday by reporting that they entered the country on tourist visas and not as refugees.The joke is on those that buy the Huffpo's line because although it is true that they entered the country via tourist visas, once here they claimed, and were granted, refugee status.Half truths are often lies.</comment>

<comment>Maybe we better not let in anymore Russians.</comment>

<comment>Go back and research the what's entailed in the refugee process. Apparently you don't understand it if you believe the Boston Bombers were refugees. They were not.</comment>

<comment>Your comment should be directed to the Washington Post which stated that they were refugees.</comment>

<comment>They came on tourist visas and then remained here, later to file for asylum which they were granted.Miriam-Webster:  refugee - one that flees; especially : a person who flees to a foreign country or power to escape danger or persecution.Since they were granted asylum, the term 'refugee' fits the fairly precisely.  Apparently you don't understand (words you used) English.</comment>

<comment>Right. They were given asylum. But that's a different -- and looser -- process than what any Syrian refugee would go through. So the point still stands -- using the Boston Bombers as an example of refugee-terrorists is off the mark, regardless of what the WP may have printed.</comment>

<comment>In plain English, they were indeed refugees.  They left Chechnya and came here for 'political' reasons, or so they said.You can check any dictionary for a definition of 'refugee'.</comment>

<comment>We're not talking about the dictionary definition, in case you missed that. We're talking about the legal definition relevant to the U.S. authorities who vet people who come into the country. The Tsarnevs were treated differently than Syrian refugees would be.

<comment>Their father applied for asylum in the U.S.   However, one of the qualifications for asylum is that you must be a Refugee.</comment>

<comment>Ouch, you might get some folks thinking.  ;-)</comment>

<comment>Um, nope. The Boston Bombers were NOT refugees. Nor were the Paris attackers.  But thanks for playing!http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>The Boston Bombers' father applied for asylum in the U.S.In order to qualify for asylum, one of the requirements is that you're a Refugee.One of the Paris Attackers' fingerprints matched those of 1 of the 198 Refugees who arrived in Greece October 3rd.The Paris attackers lived in France but were Jihadists who left France and fought for ISIS in Iraq and Syria.   France made the fatal mistake of allowing them to return.</comment>

<comment>Not crazy about the idea of a bunch of Syrian refugees, but I tend to worry much, much more about some angry, American-born, disenfranchised basement-dweller loser (regardless of political stripe) with a cache of guns and ammo and a hot enemies list. We have seen the kind of mayhem they can cause already.If that doesn't qualify as terrorism, what the hell does?</comment>

<comment>Stopped reading the WND article you cited when it called Burma a Muslim country.  Sorry, but lol.  No.</comment>

<comment>They cite Wing Nut Daily as if it were a legit news source. No wonder this country is in such trouble.</comment>

<comment>Send me a PM when your source something other than the comedy website WND.</comment>

<comment>Nobody has any way of guaranteeing anything about anyone. Most immigrants don't come in with nefarious agendas. Yes, some hope to slip in under the guise of refugeehood. But for the larger percentage, it's a genuine crisis of life or death. I guess it's hard to accept or sympathize that when you have ZERO idea about the struggle a refugee/immigrant experiences in trying to find asylum and ensure safety for themselves and their families. But let's talk facts. The fact is, homegrown terrorists are just as likely to attack as foreign terrorists. If the US really wants safety, it shouldn't just target foreigners but check its citizens too. Also, the Syrian passport found on one of the French attackers was a fake. There's a whole cheap market for fake passports out there—anybody can claim any citizenship for $2,000. That doesn't mean you label an entire community as threatening or demonic.</comment>

<comment>So basically you're saying let's just ignore all the downside in exchange for nothing in particular ?</comment>

<comment>I'm saying the costs of accommodating a few refugees isn't as high as all the rabid right-wing fearmongering suggests.</comment>

<comment>I would suggest that you go look at the cost of having a whole slew of criminals come the the US as MarielitasThe amount of crime, mayhem, murder and the ensuing social costs to pursue, arrest, convict and jail those criminals was way more in life and blood, than the "accomodation" was worth.And we're not talking about ordinary criminals when it comes to ISISWe're talking about terrorists whose primary intent and purpose is to terrorize people.Frankly I think the cost of the "accomodation" you suggest is WAY MORE than smart people are willing to pay.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, bye - the United States has no obligation to solve the problems of every refugee on the planet - especially if those efforts will be rewarded by letting in terrorists.Are you capable of learning? Doesn't the word "progressive" imply the ability to learn something? I posted many incidents of terrorism by refugees.   We just saw about 500 people shot and bombed by terrorists in Paris who exploited the weak system for processing refugees.These refugees can find refuge in Saudi Arabia - where the language, culture and religion is a better fit than the United States.  It is good for them to be closer to their homeland and also their most holy Islamic sites of Mecca and Medina.In addition, they would be exposed to Western values in the USA which are contrary to Islamic teachings and it would be insulting to Islam to inflict that on them.</comment>

<comment>Not really, you forget that these people are "refugees" for a reason. They're being persecuted by the same Islam that ISIS and Saudi purport. But for you, Muslims probably form one big lump of inhumanity. It is important to distinguish ISIS mercs from the refugee population at large. If you ever visited one of those refugee camps in Jordan or Lebanon, you'd have an idea of how terribly they actually suffer.</comment>

<comment>You are just talking out your rear end, senselessly.In fact, many of the refugees - possibly a majority - are economic refugees from all over the Arab world.This is why European authorities report that 70% of Syrian passports that they see are fake.And obviously, you are too dumb to care about the security issue.</comment>

<comment>And they carried their promise, look at French terrorists attacks.Don't forget Boston Marathon bombings were done by Refugees as well.It's a very good weakness they can exploit, especially from Syria a very badly conflicted zone that even US Intelligence itself admits they don't know which is which?So, they have little to no information about those people, it's therefore a very big risk that ISIS infiltrates those Syrian Refugees and they did already.Denying it is being completely blind to realty, it's time for people to wake up.This pose a serious National Security threat.</comment>

<comment>I stopped reading when I saw a link WNDhttp://www.sourcewatch.org/ind...Get back to me with a credible source, spud boy.</comment>

<comment>Of course a knucklehead like yourself would not notice that the actual incidents listed in the WND story  link to sites such as Washington Post, NPR and CBS news.Or are those not credible enough for you?</comment>

<comment>If you gave damn about seeming like anything but a neo-fascist stooge, you would have used any of those 3 sources instead of WND.</comment>

<comment>If you had two brain cells to rub together, you would realize that people have other things to do in life besides go to 20 different sources to put together one post.</comment>

<comment>I've seen that before: it's the Shamelessly Lazy Internet Tough Guy Stance.</comment>

<comment>Oh yawn !Another stupid troll crawls out of the rocks.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you try this instead- I'll write your post for you-"Oops, each incident listed in the WND article linked back to an MSM article. My bad, I didn't bother to check that before I spewed contempt for the source.  I'll try not to do that again- thanks for the lesson in fact-checking".You are welcome.</comment>

<comment>Why, dummy ?The fact they verifiable data is listed on WND, magically makes them less credible ?<snicker>Another regress.. uh.. progressive afraid of facing the hard truths of the universe.Run, boi, run..</comment>

<comment>Well, that's one way to run away from the hard facts..Run, boi, run..</comment>

<comment>"No doubt liberals will point to people like McVeigh, some cases of domestic terrorism.So the logic is that - because we have SOME domestic attacks - we should make things WORSE by bringing in foreign terrorists."I think the point is that any population is going to have a few bad apples (including white populations that originally immigrated to America), domestics commit horrible acts all the time, and of the 1.6 billion Muslims in the world a very tiny percentage are terrorists or try to commit terrorist acts. So why should foreign terrorism be the defining criterion for whether refugees should be received into the country?</comment>

<comment>Because Muslims have a goal to Islamize the society. They are trying to change the society.Domestics who commit horrible acts are not trying to do that.Why is that so hard for you people to understand?</comment>

<comment>Non-Muslim terrorists and white supremacists in the US also often try to change society or mold it in their image, and the US isn't being converted to Sharia law any time soon.</comment>

<comment>You have no idea what you are talking about.  The membership of the KKK has declined from millions to a handful.The Muslim population is growing every year.</comment>

<comment>One doesn't have to be a member of the KKK to be a domestic terrorist who hates some aspect of western society and happens to be white, or to commit racial, hate, or ideologically-motivated violence. Moreover, Muslim populations growing every year has little bearing on whether the US will be converted to Sharia law any time soon.</comment>

<comment>"...One doesn't have to be a member of the KKK to be a domestic terrorist who hates some aspect of western society and happens to be white, or to commit racial, hate, or ideologically-motivated violence...".This kind of behaviour is isolated and not connected to a larger, significant movement. It has no realistic goals to achieve and is going nowhere. That is obviously not the case with  Islam.  You need to do more serious thinking."...Moreover, Muslim populations growing every year has little bearing on whether the US will be converted to Sharia law any time soon...".Actually, it is the ONLY thing that has bearing on whether the USA will convert to Shariah law any time soon. And if you were smart - you would be concerned about other things SHORT of full conversion to Shariah law.For example, a West Coast cartoonist had to literally go into the equivalent of the witness protection program and give up her  name, identity and contacts with friends and family after she was foolish enough to  create a cartoon suggesting a "Draw Muhammad" contest.</comment>

<comment>Even behavior that is isolated in the sense of not being connected in a formal organization can be tied to a larger cultural or ideological struggle, e.g., violence against foreigners, certain races, police authority, the federal government, etc.The problem here is that you're apparently conceiving of Islam and terrorism as some sort of unified, monolithic entity, when the broader reality is that there are various rival factions within Islam, the vast majority of Muslims are not violent or terrorists, and most targets of Islamic terrorism are Muslims. I'm no fan or apologist for Islam as a religion; at the same time I recognize I can walk down the street to restaurants owned by the Middle eastern population in Anaheim and be treated hospitably by decent human beings."Actually, it is the ONLY thing that has bearing on whether the USA will convert to Shariah law any time soon."Well, I reject it as a realistic possibility in the first place."For example, a West Coast cartoonist had to literally go into the equivalent of the witness protection program and give up her name, identity and contacts with friends and family after she was foolish enough to create a cartoon suggesting a "Draw Muhammad" contest."But what percentage of Muslim immigrants are promulgating death threats? Radicalized Islam is a real problem, but that doesn't mean we should use that to stereotype or profile entire populations and refugees fleeing the wreckage caused by radical Islam.</comment>

<comment>1. Here is YOUR problem.  You think that the fact that Islam has serious divisions will somehow PREVENT them from gaining power and territory.  That does not follow logically nor does it correspond to reality.Islam has been on the increase in many ways in many places around the world, despite their various divisions and fights.2. "...I recognize I can walk down the street to restaurants owned by the Middle eastern population in Anaheim and be treated hospitably by decent human beings...".Yeah, me too.  That proves exactly nothing and is completely irrelevant to the discussion.3. "...Well, I reject it as a realistic possibility in the first place...".The problem with people like you, is that you don't notice and act on bad trends before it is too late.  The French are just starting to realize how badly they have f*cked up in this area - but now they already have a 10% Muslim population- and it is too late to fix their problems.4. "...But what percentage of Muslim immigrants are promulgating death threats?...".You are asking the WRONG QUESTIONS. What percentage of Americans were Mafia members in the 20th century?  A relative handful.  Yet they caused HUGE economic damage because they affected many spheres of life with organization and well-placed threats and extortions.</comment>

<comment>Other than the terrorists doing bad stuff, what "power and territory" are Muslim immigrants at large gaining? They're minorities, often despised and sometimes treated poorly by anti-immigration natives, and they're not running crime syndicates like the Mafia.</comment>

<comment>They play the long game. They don't expect to be minorities for ever.Look at Lebanon. They had a Christian majority when I was a kid - now it is a Muslim majority.  It NEVER goes against them.Study some history- you will see.</comment>

<comment>anodos7 asked:"So why should foreign terrorism be the defining criterion for whether refugees should be received into the country?"Well DUH!So that you don't import more into your country, and leave it where it currently is..</comment>

<comment>So fear that some could be terrorists is more important than compassion for suffering human beings who are fleeing the fallout of our own destabilizing foreign policies in the Middle East?</comment>

<comment>You're free to justify it any way you want.That does not bind me to your kind of stupidity.You're very much like the people who ignored the simple fact that Hitler announced in Mein Kampf what his intentions were down the line. And in full denial continued down the path of cluelessness until everthing blew up in WWII..The middle east has been a cesspit ever since islam moved in there.Read some history.Everybody and their dog has been pissing into that pot for centuries.The US is not the firstNor has it been the most consequential player.And NONE of that is ANY justification to increase risk over here just to assuage YOUR guilt.</comment>

<comment>The US has definitely been a major player. We've been meddling in the region and arming different factions for the past decades, adding fuel to the radicalization.I'm not ignoring radical Islam, who frequently target fellow Muslims, non-Muslims in the Middle East, Syrians (most of whom are not violent or radical, some of whom are Christians), and are condemned by many Muslim leaders and organizations in the US and abroad. I'm saying that taking in 10,000 Syrian refugees is not the same thing as taking in anywhere near the same number of radicalized terrorists, so the possibility that some might be terrorists shouldn't be the sole determining factor for what we should do with these people, the vast majority most of whom are not terrorists but fleeing its effects. As the article points out, US has taken in tens and hundreds of thousands of immigrants and refugees from countries that were our political enemies at the time. There's been relatively few terrorist strikes or similar carnage to show for it; indeed, terrorists strikes are a very unlikely way for American civilians to die.Moreover, ISIS is not a country or nation, let alone a developed one like Germany: they are continually strapped for resources (as their own desperate publications indicate) that make them unable to compete with western powers, their most reliable source of weapons is the US, they have miserable shortages of credentialed doctors, scholars, engineers, etc., that could sustain their "Islamic state."I support taking in a few Syrian refugees for  a similar reason why Americans should have supported receiving Jews fleeing Nazi Germany (but many did not, for whatever excuses they had.)</comment>

<comment>islam is a death cult.It is a cancer on humanityI'll accept any NON-muslim refugee before a muslim one.And that from anyplace on the planet.</comment>

<comment>Is that why many Muslim leaders, organizations, and individuals around the world have strongly condemned terrorists actions of extremists? Should the Muslim persons who raised $100K to rebuild black churches the US south (burned down in what are believed to be acts of racial hatred) be reduced to members of a death cult?Look, I'm not a fan of Islam as a religion either, but it we're taking about the character of Muslim persons or Syrian refugees the world is more complex than a Islamophobic bottom line would filter things.Civilization has always been built upon conflict, violence, and injustice, and that also goes for the history of western powers that have committed many atrocities, even in the post-Enlightenment age, without religion or explicitly against religion (French Revolution, Communism in Russia and China). Should we call western powers a virus or death cult because of its history of conquering, colonizing, enslaving, eradicating, exploiting weaker peoples, all in the name of the advancement of civilization? Islam as a religion has a real problem in that (unlike, say, Buddhism or Christianity) from the beginning its religion is conceived as being mixed with the state, so its religion is typically involved wherever state force or military would be involved (even when it's rival sects of Islam fighting).But this does not change the reality that the preponderance of refugees from the Middle East, especially ones that pass vetting processes, are victims of such conflict who have suffered far more from it than the average westerner, and are trying to forge a better life for their family and better education for their kids.</comment>

<comment>Let me put it to you in simple terms..Islam is a death cult.Muslims are members of a death cultDo you want to import members of a death cult into your society, whose basic tenets are to impose their cult on you ?Just consider them to be carriers of the cultural equivalent of the Plague.Do you want to import people who are carriers of the Plague ?Compared to islam, even though western culture has had conflicts, bit it's NOT a death cult.It's really that simple.Watch these to start to understand:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>If you are going to argue a point, maybe you should consider not ruining your point by falsely labeling people. Many of the loudest voices about how we are failing to appropriately deal with terrorism and Islam come from liberals like myself, Bill Maher, and Sam Harris.</comment>

<comment>"...Many of the loudest voices about how we are failing to appropriately deal with terrorism and Islam come from liberals like myself, Bill Maher, and Sam Harris...".LOL.  This ain't daddy's first time at the rodeo, Godless.  You three guys are in an EXTREME minority.The vast majority of your fellow liberals feel that Islamophobia is an infinitely more serious problem than either Islamic terrorism or the Islamification of the West.Many of them tell me so every day on this board.</comment>

<comment>I think you would be surprised. Not to mention that you must be on the wrong forum. Just like I can go to fox.com and see nothing about racism, you can see the liberal version of this in many liberal-centric sites. You may also not realize it because we tend to not spare any religions and that fact usually makes non-Muslim religionists tune us out. </comment>

<comment>The U.S. in general is allowing too many people to emigrate including legal and illegal immigrants - American can not even solve the domestic homelessness problem so evident in every big city, labor participation rates are at all time lows, the environment is stressed by over population, infrastructure is decaying... not to mention the record federal deficit ... why bring in people from other countries who receive government aid - resettlement funds, welfare, small business loans etc.?</comment>

<comment>Not only are they unskilled and going to eat up public resources - but their religion is opposed to the Constitution and American values and freedoms. To say nothing of the terrorism threat.  The rate of Islamic-related incidents, such as honor killings, will go up, too.Even as we speak, French police are battling MORE immigrant terrorists all over France, blowing themselves up and firing AK-47s as police raids continue.There is a picture in the morning paper of Salah Abdeslam, a Paris terrorist on the run.  His wife told reporters that he never works and collects welfare and smokes weed all day.  This seems to contradict the picture that progressives paint of Muslim immigrants in France - who are allegedly "doing jobs the French won't do".</comment>

<comment>What about Freedom of Religion?  Or, does that only apply to right-wing Evangelicals from Kentucky who directly ignore a Federal court order?I guess you are also against all white Supremicist groups?  They clearly are opposed to our Constitution.  What should we do with them?</comment>

<comment>You literally tried to compare some random woman in Kentucky to ISIS. Good lord, you're intellectually dishonest, and beyond stupid.</comment>

<comment>I did?  You draw a very crooked line to create a lie.  And you equate Syrian refugees (the original poster's intent) with Isis.  </comment>

<comment>That dishonesty lol.</comment>

<comment>Your pantswetting obsession with non-whites and creating lies.  Go hide under your bed.</comment>

<comment>You're a hack. Literally trying to complain about the fact that Republicans want the refugees (terrorists) to be vetted.</comment>

<comment>The ones speaking out most loudly,don't want them vetted. They want them barred.</comment>

<comment>Best way to make sure they don't get in..If you have a bucket of gumballs and you know that 10% are poisoned, how many of those gumballs do you really want ?How do you know that the ones you take are not poisonned ?</comment>

<comment>Sorry, progressive. "Freedom of religion" does not work among intelligent people as a smokescreen for destroying all the other freedoms - such as freedom of expression.Only simpletons fall for that trick.</comment>

<comment>If you're using ISIS to say that their religion is opposed to the constitution, then I'll go ahead and say that due to the KKK, Christianity is opposed to American values and our way of life. You can't blame a whole religion the worst .001% of a religion. I don't hate all Christians even though some very vocal members oppose basic human rights.</comment>

<comment>No, your argument fails.  The KKK does not represent Christianity.All Islam is opposed to the US Constitution, not only ISIS.</comment>

<comment>No it isn't. It's all in how you practice the religion. There are tons of Muslims in the US that manage just fine with the constitution. Why should any new Muslims be any different?</comment>

<comment>Sorry, SpaceMan - you should try looking at opinion polls once in a while instead of making up your own facts.http://www.wnd.com/2015/09/pol...A poll commissioned in May 2015 by the Center for Security Policy showed that 51 percent of American Muslims preferred that they should have their own Shariah courts outside of the legal system ruled by the U.S. Constitution. And nearly a quarter believed the use of violent jihad was justified in establishing Shariah.</comment>

<comment>And many Christians would like to insert their religion into the constitution too. Remember that whole drive to define marriage as one man and one woman as a constitutional amendment? Kim Davis and a few businesses I can think of want to be exempt from US laws because of their religion. Muslims do not have a monopoly on wanting to act outside of the laws based on their religion.</comment>

<comment>It is very offensive for you to try to equate traditional American values, such as marriage - with foreign values such as1) chopping off hands for theft2) lashes for insulting the prophet3) No freedom of the pressAn ignoramus such as yourself who cannot see the difference does not deserve to live under the American Constitutional system. You belong in Iran.</comment>

<comment>Marriage, as a family value, should be enjoyed by all Americans. And since you think that your religion SHOULD be the law of the land, I think it is you who should go live in a totalitarian theocracy.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution is just fine the way it is, and non-treason-oriented Americans are OK living with it.You should ask yourself why you want to bring in more people who want to replace it with Shariah law.</comment>

<comment>So the Christians who wanted to amend the constitution to define marriage are treason-oriented Americans?</comment>

<comment>I just told you that marriage is a traditional American value. Can you not read?Only a progressive like you would not understand what traditional American values are.</comment>

<comment>Oh I see. When Christians want to change the constitution, it's American. When anyone else wants to, it's treason. Do I have that right?</comment>

<comment>All you can do is distort.The fact is - you willfully refuse to acknowledge the difference between Islamic values and American values.You are either Muslim spouting propaganda - or a mentally-ill progressive ( a redundant phrase).</comment>

<comment>Nope. I am someone who sees marriage as an American value that should be enjoyed by all Americans. That's what makes it an American value and not just a straight person value. I am merely pointing out your hypocrisy in thinking that when Christians want the constitution to better reflect their religion, it's a good thing but when anyone else wants to do the exact same thing, it's treason. I am not distorting. That is literally what you are saying.</comment>

<comment>Marriage is not a traditional "value". Do you even know what a "value" is? Value means "a person's principles or standards of behavior; one's judgment of what is important in life." People don't all have the same values. But we all follow a standardized set of rules when it comes to marriage.  Marriage is a legally recognized union between two people, it is a civil contract.I'm not sure where you got the idea that the marriage is a "value". That's the first time I've heard that one.Example of values: Equal Justice. Fairness. Equality. Honesty. Compassion. Altruism. Selflessness. Empathy.Principles guide our actions. For example,  I don't rip off people bc that violates my sense of fairness.You ought to know that WND is not a legitimate information source, If I'm polite, I'll say it's a very far-right- (fringe) opinion factory.In reality: it's a propaganda mill.No one with a political or legal background considers it credible.When you cite to WND, people realize you lack credibility. If you don't understand that, I'm wasting my time. It would be akin to relying on political ad. </comment>

<comment>Your source is highly suspect, at best.  The Center for Security Policy, the organization that conducted/commissioned the 'poll', is a self-described opponent of a 'global jihad movement'.  Any conclusions drawn from this data are self-serving and don't contribute to any reasonable conversation.</comment>

<comment>He's a total liar. Ignore him.</comment>

<comment>Not a reputable organization.  It's run by Frank Gaffney who was once a respected Washington expert. Now he's considered a crazy. He's a conspiracy nut who sees Islamic terrorists under every bush. He accused CPAC insiders of being  agents of the Muslim Brotherhood, so he's persona non grata even in GOP circles. LOL. </comment>

<comment>Good to know, thanks for clarifying further.  It took me about 30 seconds of going down the rabbit hole with checking the sources before realizing it was complete nonsense.  The amount of illegitimate sourcing on the 'anti-refugee' side is actually fascinating in that those using them don't even seem to care about whether or not they hold any semblance of accuracy.  I guess it doesn't matter though if you just scream at people and then move on.</comment>

<comment>That study's been proven to be bullshit over and over again: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...But of course you buy it. You conservatives buy into disingenuously edited videos, outright lies by your candidates, and utterly ridiculous rumors about Obama. In fact, several months ago I had to can a guy in my office for outright lying about his coworkers to try to get them in trouble...he's a big time wingnut. So now you can't even be trusted outside of politics. Speaks volumes about who you "people" really are.</comment>

<comment>They buy into anything that confirms their biases. OK, we all do that. But the right-wingers are incredibly gullible. They love being played as chumps, then blame liberals when they're outed as falling for scams even a 3 year old would uncover.</comment>

<comment>And Islamic terrorists don't represent Islam. You cannot have it both ways. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>If you don't think islamic terrorists are not representative of islam, then you need to start studying history..</comment>

<comment>I dare you to have a contest drawing a cartoon of mudhammad.  Conversely, Robert Maplethorp got a government grant for doing his art.BTW, muslim truck drivers are winning their lawsuits not to deliver beer or bacon.  Atlantic posters were full of glee that Christians have to bake cakes for a gay wedding.Weirdos like you will not be happy until women are dressed up in a hijab and non muslims pay a jizya.  But as long as Christians are having a miserable time you'll be happy, happy, happy.</comment>

<comment>Why would I host such a contest? That would be like having a "piss on the cross" contest. It's insulting for no reason. And I want women to dress however they want to dress, hajib or bikini. No, I don't want non-muslims to have to pay a tax. I am not Muslim.</comment>

<comment>I feel sympathy for the refugees truly running for their lives, but you need to educate yourself on what's actually happening with that part of the world, and also about the people who live there. Talking points from the Huffpost aren't enough to make an intelligent decision.</comment>

<comment>Okay, Mister Condescending. I'll go check with Fox news.</comment>

<comment>One more thing... Salah Abdelsalam, as big of a scum murderer as he is, is not a Muslim immigrant.  He was born in Belgium and lives in France. Using the term immigrant to describe him is the equivalent of using the term on someone who moves from Michigan to Ohio.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - thanks for the nitpick quibble.  In the case of Muslim immigrants, the children are often much more of a problem than the parents are.The parents are too concerned with the mundane, pressing details of survival in a new environment to have time for philosophical concerns.The children have more of the luxury of time and resources to ponder jihad.</comment>

<comment>You're right. Time to deport the Muslims.</comment>

<comment>Let me guess...put them on a train to Poland ?</comment>

<comment>It's even worse he was a native born citizen! It means his parents were excepted by the Beligian people and he betrayed not only his parents, but the Country who embraced him. Multiculturalism has been a complete failure and these folks need to assimilate or leave. A traitor and a murderous terrorist should get a lot more than water boarded  when they catch his pathetic arse. </comment>

<comment>"...Multiculturalism has been a complete failure and these folks need to assimilate or leave....".They have already made it clear that they have no desire to assimilate.  Unfortunately, the stupid Europeans made no demand that they do.  Most Americans appear to be just as dumb.</comment>

<comment>How do you know he betrayed his parents?  He may be their pride and joy.  We just don't have any facts to make a claim one way or another.</comment>

<comment>Doubtful unless they were in on it and they would have been detained by now. Minor point to a broader issue. </comment>

<comment>"but their religion is opposed to the Constitution and American values and freedoms"You can say the exact same about the 125,000 Communist Cubans</comment>

<comment>Communism is not hereditary like Islam is. You fail again.</comment>

<comment>YupAnd they should also be encouraged to head back to Communist Cuba..It's just plain stupid to allow people in this country, who:- believe an ideology not only opposite to the fundamental beliefs of this country- believe an ideology that clearly declares it's intent to force everyone submit to it.That's no differently from allowing someone with ebola into your house because they are homeless.</comment>

<comment>Progressives are the number one national security threat.</comment>

<comment>"Communism is not hereditary like Islam is. You fail again."Islam is not hereditary either. Religion is taught, not passed down genetically.</comment>

<comment>Except that under islam, if you want to leave, the rest can kill you for it..http://www.reuters.com/article...</comment>

<comment>Your word games are not clever. In fact, you don't understand that the word "heritage" has other meanings and uses besides genetics.You are looking foolish.</comment>

<comment>You said 'hereditary', not 'heritage'. Two very different things.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, he is always making blunders and then saying he never makes blunders. His posts are riddled with misinformation and distortions.</comment>

<comment>Spuds is the rare (NOT) combination of liar and idiot.</comment>

<comment>It's you who are looking foolish.</comment>

<comment>Oh?  Let me guess, you're a 'constitutionalist' who sees nothing wrong with Christians dictating laws that violate the freedom of women, or gay people, or health care? You neoconservatives LOVE sharia law, but only the Christian version of it.  By your logic we should also expel Christians from America.If we do as neocons want and invade the Middle East again, these incidents will only increase.  The Global Terrorism Index has recorded that terrorist incidents have increased five-fold since the US initiated the so-called 'war on terror', and it's because we stink at killing terrorists, but we're pretty awesome at killing innocent people and civilians.Stereotypes and bumper sticker slogans... is that all you've got?  Immigrants in America are inviting people to take their jobs.  They've even put up a website for it. (takeourjobs.org)</comment>

<comment>All YOU have is stereotypes.'Fighting terrorism only creates more terrorists'.'Every casualty is an innocent civilian'.And your silly "takeourjobs"propaganda does not work on educated people who understand economics.Economics tells us that as supply of workers goes down, wages for those jobs goes up.</comment>

<comment>Spoken like someone who is not aware of the status of 'papers please' laws throughout the south, which did drive away farm workers, both undocumented and native.Your stereotypes have led to truly bad legislation, legislation that had a demonstrably negative impact on agriculture.But you'd probably have fields going to rot than someone working to feed their family in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Spudwhisperer, when you read the Atlantic comments a normal person will know that 75% of these guys are bat shit crazy.You should come over to National Review.  People are sane over there.</comment>

<comment>I have to ask what kind of malignant narcissism drives a right-winger to troll a site where a good portion of the readers are well-educated, and, as a result, progressive. I've read your posts, You are so out of your depth that you don't realize you what a fool you make of yourself.  You cite to laughable right-wing sources, sources so notoriously unreliable that no knowledgeable conservatives would rely on them, The source alone impugns your reputation. You'd be better off citing comic books, to be honest. </comment>

<comment>LOLBeing well-educated does NOT automatically lead to progressivism..As a matter of fact, the opposite is true.Progressives start out as progressive when they are young and ignorant..The older ones never got past that stage, because they stopped asking questions AND honestly answering them later on.You demonstrate the proof of that with your arrogant ignorance and prejudices..That's also why so many progressives need to constantly harp on why they are so superior..Having a need to constantly tell others how superior you are comes from an inferiority complex.So why, deep down, do you consider yourself inferior ?The truth will set you free. BUT ONLY if you are honest enough to actually face the truth.</comment>

<comment>it's impressive how many people want to shout at their ideological opponents just to get their rocks off. it makes for boring reading.</comment>

<comment>Douchebag - go back to your shoeshine stand. You are too stupid to get a GED, you high school dropout.</comment>

<comment>The French just announced they're going to accept 30,000 Syrian refugees in the next year. Thus offering us an example of a country not ruled by fear.</comment>

<comment>Bravado is a pretty good indicator of fear.Look up the meaning.Another word for it is bluster.</comment>

<comment>Do they have a choice under Merkel's EU?</comment>

<comment>Not all refugees are equal. We can't afford to risk ISIS Barbarians imbedded with the refugees.And Fake Syrian Passports are a huge issue.</comment>

<comment>What's wrong with smoking weed all day?</comment>

<comment>"There is a picture in the morning paper of Salah Abdeslam, a Paris terrorist on the run.  His wife told reporters that he never works and collects welfare and smokes weed all day. This seems to contradict the picture that progressives paint of Muslim immigrants in France - who are allegedly "doing jobs the French won't do."This paragraph alone deserves 100 upvotes.People are shocked by this kind of thing, but when you read the profiles of jihadis in Europe, you get used to seeing losers, social misfits, or dysfunctional sorts (often complete with petty criminal background, which is quite fitting when you look at Zarqawi) that'd probably be mass shooters or gang members or suicides if were they born in the USA. Hell, most white nationalist/KKK types I've seen are usually quiet social outcasts who attach no value to their lives, not outspoken rednecks with lots of friends. And that's precisely why further social stigma of racism is useless against them.This is probably one of the biggest misconceptions on European born terrorists. And it's not even always about poverty: many of them are actively rejecting their comfortable lives. They are doing this to fight for something "greater" and be men rather than being interested in the theological niceties. Radical Islam and foreign money just make it far, far, far worse in terms of what they can do.</comment>

<comment>Haha. Your comment is hilarious. That is a great satire of the right. It's so satirical I might even call it a caricature.</comment>

<comment>Hey doom and gloom...1.  The environment is cleaner than at any point since the Industrial Revolution...the air has less particulates, less ozone forming chemicals, less carbon monoxide, and less Lead (Pb).  It's an objective fact.2.  Labor participation rates are not at all-time lows.  Take one minute to complete a Google Search an you will find charts indicating this to not being close to reality.3.  Infrastructure definitely needs upgrading, that is simply a matter of Congress getting their heads out of their behinds and passing a bill.  Rebuilding bridges, roads and tunnels is not rocket science.4.  The Federal deficit?  What matters is its relation to GDP, and right now, it is at an historical norm.  FYI, when Bush left office the deficit was nearly 10% of GDP, it has decreased every year since.</comment>

<comment>Hey sorry to pop your strawman, but the facts you listed are patently false.1. I seriously doubt there's much detectable difference between now and 6 years ago on pollution levels. Certainly worldwide since China, India and Russia ignore and will continue to ignore Obama on Climate change its meaningless since they are the top Carbon producers.2. The participation rate is the lowest in 40 plus years at 62% so you are dead wrong there too. http://www.usnews.com/news/the...3. So both sides work with the States for infrastructure funds? What's the point?4.  According to the CBO the deficit will explode in the next 10 years to 75% of GDP,http://www.miamiherald.com/new...Nice straw man and thanks for setting up a false narrative I could destroy with facts!  </comment>

<comment>You love the pet Internet term "straw man", but you also like to play loose with the facts.1.  What does six years have to do with anything, other than  your obvious hatred for Obama?  The original post has nothing to do with six years or Obama, so get lost.2.  The original post said ALL TIME LOWS.  We are not close to ALL TIME LOWS.  Learn how to read.3.  Projections that you cherry pick to work in your favor.just say you hate Obama, an move on. I'm not interested in a debate.</comment>

<comment>Your not interested in debate because you have no facts on your side to prove your propaganda! Understood and thanks for the layup. </comment>

<comment>Anyone who ignores the environmental factors in what is going on in today in Syria is someone who has no handle on reality, nor wishes to have one.One can actually be a conservative, with a conservative view on this issue insofar as policy, diplomacy, military, security, immigration, and still hold in their mind that the effects of drought and famine in an already oppressive state in a region of the world that has been highly destabilized, first by the Cold War ping pong game played there, then in our Long War fiascos there, and in the vaccuum, the emergence of angry militants who seemingly have an equal if not far greater disregard for the conditions in which human life does more than just survive than those who preach what, me worry? with regard to the environment.  Burying your head in the sand about the state of our environment and its effects, however, just to adhere to the dogma of your political bias undercuts your entire perspective.We have on going human crisis right now in which more of humanity has been displaced from their homes than any isolated natural disaster we can imagine, and yet the pressures put upon the world we live in and humanity  in a single locale need only a single atmospheric match to light such a conflagaration.</comment>

<comment>Now that was wordy! Climate change has become a political catch all for the left. Climate changes always have occurred and the question is does man really have that much effect? I say no and I certainly don't think carbon emissions had anything to do with ISIS, a drought in Syria or fires in California! Bunch of crap and since Global Warming was disproved now we have climate change in a reboot so we can almost explain any event with it on the left. Get a grip!</comment>

<comment>An ignorant jack dog barking at the moon.  Listen Johnny Ostrich, even the Defense Dept. of the US government recognizes what the scientific community all over the world doing the nuts and bolts studying of climate, what every major university in the world has whole rafts of course work and research devoted to, and every major newspaper in the world reports almost daily one new finding or story corroborating.  Ignorance is as ignorance does, and history even before this particular period where the anthropenic effects have gone so far viral as to effect the entire world is riddled with the fall of empires at the hands of environmental havoc, often man made.Jack Dog Says No. Really, and you sir, what are your credentials on this issue other than a large bark and a dose of they think it, so it must not be so?But then the 500 year drought in California, the melting of glaciers world wide, the non stop reportage of history long high temperatures, whole varieties of conifers suddenly dying en masse, the rapidly escalating desertification of the world, the rapidly changing ecosystems forcing whole groups of birds and insects to change their migration patterns, the rapidly falling availability of potable drinking water, the sea level rises incurring whole islands and in particularly northern sea shores in the Pacific, what, Jack Dog, worry? Rather let's get all up in everyone's ear about the lottery like, struck by lightning chance--real statistics measuring real occurrence--you will be the victim of a terror attack.  Get a grip, my ash.</comment>

<comment>Let's make it simple for the silly warmistas..1) The planet has been warming since the last ice Age.An Ice Age that had glaciers depress the land that formed the Great Lakes and left gouges in very old bedrock with the scouring as the the glaciers, estimated to be a mile high moved round..2) There has been no noticeable warming of the planet over the last 17 years..3) Just about all the data and models used to predict future disasters, have completely failed to even predict the 17 year stoppage in warming4) Meanwhile, solar activity has been dropping, and historical geological data points towards future cooling and even a mini Ice Age, like occurred in the 14th Century, when wolves were able to cross the frozen Seine river to enter Paris.(Currently we have wolves crossing Euro borders from the Middle-East to ravage Paris)5) The Defense Department did not as such recognize global warming. Instead, following tradition and doctrine, it has studied what possible problems could occur and affect the military and the US IF global warming did in fact come to pass..(Can you understand the difference ?)The bottom line with allowing muslim refugees into the US is a simple one.- A large portion, about 50+% hold notions that are contrary to basic social principles in the US- A smaller portion about 25+% have no problems with coming here and agitating for implementiation of Sharia, which is DEFINITELY contrary the social principles in the US.- A smaller portion, about 10+% have no problems taking violent action to effect social change in the USSo to use a simile, we have a big bucket of gumdrops of which about 10% are poisonned. And there is no good way to identify which of those gumdrops are the poisoned ones.So how many buckets of gumdrops do you want to bring home ?</comment>

<comment>Basic human compassion?</comment>

<comment>There is only so much money to be spent on refugees, so maybe we agree.  Spend the money on refugees from the Americas.</comment>

<comment>Agreed - no more room at the inn.</comment>

<comment>Because the true objective is to diminish the U.S. and provide for more folks voting for the leftist Democrats so that job can continue.  For most of the politicos, it's mostly about power and influence.  For the true believers, it's far worse.</comment>

<comment>They already have lol.</comment>

<comment>We have plenty of problems of our own, but 67% of us claim to be Christians, and there's nothing more Christ-like than offering a helping hand to the people who need it the most.  It's hard to think that people fleeing war aren't deserving of aid.But this is America.  We had ten thousand kids show up at the border fleeing human traffickers and gangs, and too many of us argued that we should send them right back to the wolves.In WWII we sent boats of Jewish refugees back to Europe to die.  We faulted the entire Japanese American community with Pearl Harbor, marched them out of their homes at gunpoint, and put them in concentration camps.It's almost a certainty that we'll do the wrong thing here out of fear. For all of our lip service about how brave we are, we rarely show it when it matters.</comment>

<comment>It's very offensive for you to compare Jewish refugees to Islamic refugees.Especially given that Islamic immigrants in Europe have been responsible for driving out the remnants of ancient Holocaust-surviving Jewish communities due to constant anti-Semitic attacks and synagogue assaults.I guess progressives like you are totally shameless.</comment>

<comment>Within the context I'm using, it's wholly appropriate.The difference between you and I is that I wouldn't have turned the boats of Jewish refugees away.  You would have.</comment>

<comment>No, I would not have.  In fact, Jewish refugees from Germany were kept in camps - such as the one in Ithaca, NY so that the authorities would have the time to investigate to make sure that Nazi spies were not infiltrated among them.It is an unfortunate irony, considering that they were refugees from extermination camps, but it had to be done.</comment>

<comment>Yes, you would have.  You're advocating for an equivalent action even now throughout this thread.  You're a coward, so cowardly you think our country should do the wrong thing.No.  Ithaca was a effectively a prison camp, just like the ones we marched ethnic Japanese into at gunpoint. The way we treated people then is shameful, and sadly, you don't have the conscience to feel such shame.</comment>

<comment>Under progressive leadership like Obama or someone like you - the USA would have surrendered to Nazi Germany.</comment>

<comment>Good thing we had that rock ribbed conservative Franklin Roosevelt at the helm!</comment>

<comment>I guess you are trying to be snarky - but in fact, a 1940s era "liberal" is equivalent to a 2015 conservative.Time does not stand still.</comment>

<comment>Dude, read FDRs 1st inaugural address, the 'only thing we have to fear...' speech.  Here are some gems:" the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated. Practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men.""Happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort. The joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits. These dark days, my friends, will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves, to our fellow men.""Our greatest primary task is to put people to work. This is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously. It can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the Government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing great -- greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our great natural resources."</comment>

<comment>Dude - conservatives do not oppose putting people to work. WTF have you been smoking?And why would you think that conservatives only care about money? You got some wack ideas, there.Like I said - FDR was much more conservative than today's nutjob progressives who eschew American culture and values.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think you can sweep the issue of possible Daesh sympathizers and agents completely under the rug with analogies to Jewish refugees fleeing the Holocaust? There was no Jewish equivalent of Daesh out there, so that parallel really cannot work.I would have no problem accepting large numbers of Ukrainian refugees. We have accepted large numbers from Myanmar and I would have no problem with many more. We have accepted large numbers from Bhutan and I would have no problem with many more. I would have no problem with accepting large numbers of Copts and Yazidis who are under increasing threat of persecution in the Muslim world. But neither the Constitution nor our own secular values compel us to be absolute cultural relativists or absolutely blind to the agendas of the factions in power at putative refugees' points of origin. You can't simply say "a refugee is a refugee is a refugee." We know that Daesh intends to strike at the U.S. homeland with its Islamist agents, and we know that it has already snuck agents into Europe among the flood of refugees entering there. There is no equivalent risk with respect to accepting refugees from the former USSR, Myanmar, Bhutan, and so on, or accepting non-Muslim refugees from Muslim atrocities (Copts, Yazidis, etc.). Even the risk of accepting Iraqi and Afghan Muslims is different than accepting Muslims from Daesh-controlled areas.</comment>

<comment>The whole problem is that everybody here is confusing "sanctuary" with "asylum". We can't let those people die. We can AND should give them sanctuary.BUT we can't give them asylum, because right now we can't tell who's who. Asylum seekers need to go through a process, usually a lenghty vetting process. Sanctuary can be provided rather swiftly.Preferably , the closest possible from the point of origin.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that we're confusing sanctuary and asylum, at least how you're using those terms.  What has clearly been proposed is asylum: bringing them here, not providing a sanctuary as close as possible to the point of origin.  If we want to have a separate discussion about sanctuary, I'm all for that, but I don't think the people participating upthread--either me or the others cautioning against asylum or the others in favor of opening the gates wide--mistook the subject.If the subject is an American-protected sanctuary near the point of origin, say in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, or even Iraq, and we have the cooperation of the respective government there, I'm all for being part of a humanitarian force protecting refugees there.  That is very different than offering them asylum here. Offering our protection to millions there would be more politically workable and less culturally risky than offering true asylum to even a fraction of that number here.</comment>

<comment>All 27Gov's in Europe want exactly that. Alone in Europe, Merkel said "no , we'll give them ALL asylum, no limits! " That sparked an avalanche, and here we are. In the last G-20 , when i saw Obama and Putin talking , i thought "finally, the parents arrived at home ! " This whole refugee mess is all on Merkel. The Paris attacks are also on Merkel's tab. Yes, the terrorists were homegrown, but two of them made a point of following Merkel's chaotic route. Widespread id fraud makes it very difficult to tell who's who. So, until we can sort them ,sanctuary. The ones we CAN sort, can apply for asylum, using the legal route.</comment>

<comment>I see a war, a genocidal faction and people fleeing. Not that different.</comment>

<comment>Quite different. Jews don't go around killing other Jews of a different rite, do they now?</comment>

<comment>It's very offensive for you to blame all the refugees for specific incidents of anti-semetism. This is coming from a Jew. If you're offended on behalf of Jews, you don't speak for me.</comment>

<comment>Self-hating progressive "Jews" are a dime a dozen, buddy.</comment>

<comment>Who said I hate myself?</comment>

<comment>Helping your enemies is hating yourself, Skippy.</comment>

<comment>I don't help my enemies. I also don't assume that everyone who believes different things from me is an enemy.</comment>

<comment>Believe different "things"? What if they believe they should kill you and all those who believe as you do? Is that still cool with you?</comment>

<comment>They do not all believe that. A fraction of a percent believe that.</comment>

<comment>Really? So a terrorist hides in a Muslim community after the attacks and at least 3 people recognized the terrorist(s) and did not inform the police. This shows pretty clearly that the terrorists not only have but can count on the sympathy of the Muslim community at large.How much more evidence is required?</comment>

<comment>A statistic more significant than 3 out of the millions of Muslims.</comment>

<comment>It's always 3 here, 3 there. Adds up to hundreds and thousands over the years. But sure, no problem there, chief. Tell you what: You invite all of them to your country and only yours and spare us from them.</comment>

<comment>From the big bad scary families running from ISIS. Sure, I'd be happy if my country took them in to protect yours.</comment>

<comment>Running from ISIS? You mean ISIS is in Turkey and Jordan now as well? Gee, I thought those were safe spaces, courtesy of the BlackLivesMatter retard children. And then the Geneva convention says they're no longer allowed to go to Europe as refugees, since they're getting some diversity and tolerance coaching in the safe space: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>While I agree with Obama (and you) on taking in a reasonable amount of screened refugees, both for foreign policy and personal reasons, let's be blunt: I missed the part where Jewish (or Vietnamese, or 90s Yugoslav) refugees brought any sort of realistic security threat on this level.It's arguments like this that help the GOP. The American public isn't going to buy the idea that there is no need to worry about security or that doing so is simply disguised racism, and they shouldn't.                                    </comment>

<comment>The key is "realistic" threat. These Syrians are no more likely to be a threat than any other group. The Paris attackers? European born and raised. We've resettled thousands of Somali, Afghan, and Iraqi refugees without any terror issues. There is just some sort of assumption that of this 10,000 (a big chunk of which are children), there's gotta be a certain number of terrorists, but there's no explanation as to why. Other than "Muslim." But looking at the facts of the situation, they are no more likely to be dangerous than anyone else.</comment>

<comment>You leftoids always hold Christianity over us when you want to impose unwanted and unlikely to assimilate or productive refugees. Of course you do nothing but hold Christianity against us when it's about homo marriage or murdering unborn children.</comment>

<comment>How can terrorists NOT infiltrate refugee groups.Refugees are dislocated strangers surroundd by other dislocated strangers just like them.How hard is it for a wlolf in sheep's clothing to hide among them biding it's time to attack ?</comment>

<comment>This was the same reason why the MS St. Louis was sent back to Europe, because of the risk of anarchist and communist infiltrators in its Jewish refugees.</comment>

<comment>Communists were not doing suicide vest attacks and spraying AK-47s in sports stadiums, restaurants and concert halls in the USA in the 1940s.Your comparison is extremely offensive and disingenuous.</comment>

<comment>No, they were using mail bombsAnd considering over 60% of the people agreed with the government's actions at the time, you're going to have to find more than personal attacks to back up your claim.Penance for the crime of unfairly sending back all those refugees is one of the reasons the Canadians are taking in 25 000 Syrians. And that's a country with a tenth the population of the USA and an economy in a much weaker state than the USA's</comment>
