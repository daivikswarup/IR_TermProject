<comment>Sorry, My friend. I've visited with this name since just to take a look around.I made a business decision.I understand you're hopeful. But you and I both know you would not be allowed to say "ding dong the witch is dead" if Hillary died.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is no Maggie thatcher, she wouldn't rate me singing about the witch being dead</comment>

<comment>Is this a joke?</comment>

<comment>Liberals paying "tribute to his legacy"?  I seem to have missed those tributes.</comment>

<comment>Auto-erotic asphyxiation with a pillow is no way to go.</comment>

<comment>Uh, what?</comment>

<comment>We all know what happened.</comment>

<comment>"We all" know?  No, we all don't.  You're suffering some serious self-delusion.</comment>

<comment>To clarify, Scalia died at a gay amyl-nitrate sex party. The last words he heard was Chris Christie saying, "you ain't gonna sit (sic) right for a week.Wipe the do-nothing, obstructionist  Republican Congress out of office.</comment>

<comment>I see a liberal  projecting.</comment>

<comment>So a troll is now liberal, why exactly?</comment>

<comment>Goodness, you seem to be suffering an acute case of anger-induced hysteria.  Hope you can get some help.  Meanwhile, I suggest you try sipping a cold beer while listening to some nice music (that is if you're old enough to drink a beer).</comment>

<comment>I thought we were not supposed to talk about this. You know, in public.</comment>

<comment>Gay is not a crime Jim.</comment>

<comment>No thanks to Antonin.</comment>

<comment>Well you can go tohttp://www.theatlantic.com/pol...which is literally THIS ARTICLE.</comment>

<comment>OK, then what?</comment>

<comment>Then you will not have missed the fact that liberals are paying tribute to Scalia. Your comment was just very weird to read on a liberal tribute to Scalia.</comment>

<comment>Actually yes, I missed the "tribute" part.</comment>

<comment>So, are you not getting what "tribute" means, or what "great means (it's right there in the title). Other praises heaped on Scalia in this article: "charming", "distinguished", "towering figure" and "inspired a generation... including me." Are you still missing it?</comment>

<comment>Were those praises heaped on him by liberals?  The quote of E. Kagan is indeed positive, albeit old.  Other "praises" noted herein are distinctly tongue-in-cheek, while still others are outright negative.  No, this can hardly be characterized as a "liberal tribute" to Scalia.  Furthermore, I predict that it will be further diminished in the days to come.</comment>

<comment>Read Slate.  They are saying lots of nice things about him, somewhat to my surprise.</comment>

<comment>If that's true then I'm happy to stand corrected.It is indeed unusual for liberals to direct anything other than insult and attempted censorship toward those with whom they disagree, so I can understand why it would be a surprise to you.</comment>

<comment>He was a loathsome little man, like so many religious conservatives: arrogant, vain, malicious, wilfully ignorant, and determined to impose his dingbat and destructive religious views on everyone else.</comment>

<comment>Gracious.  All that hate and anger can shorten your life span.</comment>

<comment>Seems to have done that for him (thank goodbness!).  For me, expressing the truth helps me live longer.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm, perhaps so.Why you must already be 16 years old or thereabout.</comment>

<comment>68, and looking forward to many more years of commenting on the evils of religious nuts.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I don't believe you. No one could possibly attain that advanced age and remain so shallow and simplistic as you seem to be.</comment>

<comment>You'd be surprised!</comment>

<comment>That's because some of us just get smarter and smarter.  Comes from not being religious nuts.</comment>

<comment>You attribute it to that?  To THAT?Shallow and simplistic --- but I said that already, so never mind.</comment>

<comment>Dude, he is an angry young gay "man", when he is not wearing his mom's panties.</comment>

<comment>Who?  Bubba?  That would make lots of sense.  He seems a little off.  (his meds, maybe?)  ;-)  Just kidding.  Chris Vogel seems to be fairly intelligent and not at all angry.   Chris also seems quite thoughtful and complex, unlike the weirdos defending the rotten, corporate-owned Scalia.</comment>

<comment>Smarter or just more vicious?  In effect you are propagating the evil of which you speak so eloquently, diverse human rights be damned!</comment>

<comment>I'm with you, age 75. Religion has done a great job at softening the brains of many people with its absurd stories, so that now they'll believe anything at all.</comment>

<comment>Another moron who does not understand allegory.</comment>

<comment>Allegory?  I'm afraid you vastly over-rate the quality of your writing.</comment>

<comment>Please explain or shut up.</comment>

<comment>What?  Me "explain"?  It is you who has posted the incoherent snarky meanderings and name-calling.  So --- shut up yourself.:-)</comment>

<comment>And yet another moron who does not understand allegory. Snarky? I am afraid you vastly over-rate your intelligence.</comment>

<comment>Nice. A right wing nut is having a spat with another right wing nut. Predictably, the argument is so lacking in substance, it's comical.</comment>

<comment>Well, I am not a "right wing nut", but you are certainly correct in noting that the present mini-dispute is lacking in substance. Still, it is also worth noting that only one of us resorted to name-calling and insult.   And -- what makes you think qaz zaq is a "right wing nut"?  He seems like a plain old generic nut to me.</comment>

<comment>Too bad you begin with an insult. Doesn't yr religion teach you to be kind to others? Or is that just a metaphor as well. </comment>

<comment>No, it does not.  And what makes you think I am Christian?  And for Christians, Jesus said "Do unto others as they would do unto you."  Not "Be kind to everybody". And both religions considered blasphemy a serious sin. PS  Metaphor is not the same as Allegory.  And yes, you are a moron too.</comment>

<comment>An allegory is an extended metaphor.  And yes, you're nasty so this is the end.</comment>

<comment>Scalia is dead, so he's now a good conservative. I am glad Scalia died. One less right wing parasite on the supreme court.</comment>

<comment>It wouldn't matter to me if he died or retired. As long as he is off the bench it is good.</comment>

<comment>Hey fudge packer, I hope you get AIDS, or Esophageal Gonorrhea.</comment>

<comment>I hope you die like that worthless POS Scalia.</comment>

<comment>what makes Scalia great is that he's now a dead maggot.</comment>

<comment>i HOPE YOUR LOVED ONES GET CANCER AND DIE FROM IT.</comment>

<comment>Speaking from experience, are you ?</comment>

<comment>I don't believe anyone accused you of being a Christian.It certainly would not have occurred to me to do so.No, metaphor is not the same as allegory.  You appear not to understand either.</comment>

<comment>Wow, how'd you beat the whole aids thing?  Guess those drug companies aren't so evil after all.</comment>

<comment>One of the many advantages of not living in the United States.  For the last 15 years, HIV meds--one pill a day--insure no bad effects from the infection or the medications themselves, until you die of old age.  Big Pharma is still evil, though. charging $40+ for what costs them $1.65, but we have Pharmacare (along with universal free medical and hospital care).  We pay for this with taxes but, even with taking them into consideration, we (and everyone else in the world) pay much less for our healthcare than do you Americans, and you have an amazingly crappy and inadequate system, considering the obscenely large profits that HMO's make.</comment>

<comment>I love how we're supposed to show tolerance in the face of all of the right wing intolerance.  go back in to your single wide - your Mom/second cousin is calling you.</comment>

<comment>"Right wing intolerance"?And from what planet did you so recently arrive?It isn't Right Wingers who are herein posting their hatred for A. Scalia, for Christians, for conservatives, and for all who depart from their chosen ideology.</comment>

<comment>You must have known him personally?  Oh wait, you are making assumptions about the character of someone you did not know at all.  Have you read that Ginsberg was one of his closest friends?  Would a darling of the left be such friends with a person of such low character?  I think not.</comment>

<comment>I just read his decisions.  He was vile.</comment>

<comment>What you really mean of course is that you did not agree with his decisions.  Your following conclusion is pretty small-minded, don't you think?</comment>

<comment>Nope, just understanding the law as it applies in real life.  No doubt people like Scalia (vain, arrogant) imagined that they were right, but they were wrong.</comment>

<comment>I submit that you rather highly over-rate your own "understanding".  I will venture an educated guess that you have not read any of Scalia's decisions or arguments.  You are shooting from the hip without benefit of any real thought.</comment>

<comment>Nope, reading them was easy; they are all online.  You might consider doing this, too.  And also, he made many public statements--he assumed that everyone want to hear his garbage.  Actually, now that I think of it, I don't recommend anyone paying any attention to anything he ever said or wrote.  Good riddance.</comment>

<comment>It's hard to argue with someone as knowledgeable and intelligent as yourself, but they're not giving up.</comment>

<comment>Oh come now, it's not hard at all!</comment>

<comment>I'm so impressed by the important points y'all've been making.</comment>

<comment>Yes indeed, there are some really deep thinkers posting here today!     ;-)</comment>

<comment>I submit that you rather highly over-rate your "understanding".  I will venture an educated guess that you have not read any  ----- oh, wait, never mind, I already said that.   :-)</comment>

<comment>Yes, and made a fool of yourself. You should actually read the facts so you can spew them instead of ignorance on a subject you accuse others of not being educated on.</comment>

<comment>I will reaffirm my conviction that you are full of angry hot air and that you have indeed not read any of Scalia's arguments.  Furthermore, snark and insult are not arguments, and that's all you've got. --- so you lose.</comment>

<comment>Hey, Packer, how about an example?</comment>

<comment>Nope, you can do the work and deal with reality yourself.  Both will be a novel and painful experience for you, but I recommend them.</comment>

<comment>Here's a Scalia quote,,,“There are – there are those who contend that it does not benefit African Americans to ­­ to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less­-advanced school, a less – a slower-track school where they do well.“One of – one of the briefs pointed out that – that most of the – most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they’re – that they’re being pushed ahead in – in classes that are too ­­ too fast for them.”It's you who thinks too highly of themselves. Clearly "you have not "read any of Scalia's decisions or arguments. You are shooting from the hip without benefit of any real thought."Right...Look in the mirror. Nice job indicting yourself btw.</comment>

<comment>And you've repeated this quote how many times now ?Too bad that this quote only superficially points and what you want it to mean.And instead shows that you have not spent a moment thinking of it and in the context in which it was said.That is the problem with out of context quotes.It only makes the quoter look stupid.</comment>

<comment>I am familiar with that Scalia quote and have no idea why you deem it relevant to your attempted argument.  But at least we can see that you know how to cut and paste.</comment>

<comment>Typical of Scalia:  patronizing and condescending, and, of course, sabotaging efforts to insure that minorities have equal access to education.  That arrogant vanity and wilful ignorance were typical of him.  Thank goodness he's gone.</comment>

<comment>You moronic dishonest liar.That was a comment made during oral hearings questionning the legal arguments of the lawyers.Funny how you accuse Scalia of what you are suffering.In Psychology, that's called projection.</comment>

<comment>Vintage Scalia, showing how little he was interested in anything that might reasonably be called justice or the public welfare, at the expense, as always, of people he considered inferior to himself.  That's the kind of person he was, and certainly unsuitable to being a judge, and no lie.</comment>

<comment>Just pure ignorant bigotry.</comment>

<comment>His fellow Justices don't think so, so that makes them vile too!</comment>

<comment>For the ones who were so foolish as to agree with him.</comment>

<comment>MLK didn't support SS marriage. Besmirch him</comment>

<comment>Hi wife says he did.  She knows him better than you.</comment>

<comment>You going to tell me next that Jackie Kennedy's ghost told you that that JFK supported gay marriage too?</comment>

<comment>Given that a large and steadily increasing majority of Americans support same-sex marriage, accompanied by many political and religious leaders, he would have supported same-sex marriage long ago.</comment>

<comment>Don't ask don't tell, was Clinton. Obama was against SSM until he wanted the gay vote.  Get real, Packer.</comment>

<comment>You will get used to it, or at least pretend to, just as you are pretending to accept equality for Jews, blacks and women.  Stay tuned or ask your kids.</comment>

<comment>I am a Jewish woman, idiot.  And trust me, Jews are jumping off The Good Ship Liberal Moron.  PS  The Torah considers homosexuality a serious sin.</comment>

<comment>How nice; too bad you pay so little attention to reality.  In any case, one after the other the divisions of Judaism are welcoming homosexuals and same-sex marriages.</comment>

<comment>Call me when they revise the Torah.  Rot in hell sodomite.</comment>

<comment>Interesting.  The Old Testament is clear that the sin of Sodom was inhospitality.  Guess that makes you the Sodomite.  Plus, you need to be more scripturally literate.  On the other hand, being a religious nut, you can buh-leeve whatever you just invented.  Halelujah!</comment>

<comment>Hey sodomite, read it.  Genesis 13.  PS  Better stock up on some SPF 40,000 sun tan oil.</comment>

<comment>What a shame that your literacy skills are so low.  Here's what it says in the original:"Sodomy" has been the most common term for homosex­ual intercourse, and "sodomite" has been the name given to a person engaging in homosexual intercourse. Both words come from the name of the biblical town of Sodom, and theyperpetuate the belief that homosexual intercourse was the char­acteristic and typical sin of the men of Sodom,for which the town and its inhabitants were utterly destroyed. The vividness with which the story is told has ensured that, whatever else most people may think that the Bible says about homosexual­ity, they know the story of Sodom, and they think they know that the story demonstrates God's particular abhorrence ofhomosexuality.What does the Biblestory say?When God accuses Sodom (Gen. 18.20; 19.13), God does not specify any particular sin for which the cities are to be destroyed. In the narrative of Lot's confrontation with the men of Sodom, the men create a riot outside Lot's house because they want to "know" the two strangers whom Lot has taken in. Lot tries to bribe them off by of­fering them his two daughters who "have not known man". When Lotuses the verb "know", it clearly means "know sexually".  Readers, therefore, commonly jump to the conclusion that when the men of Sodom used the verb "know", theretoo it meant "know sexually", so that they were demanding the strangers for homosexual intercourse.The Hebrew word for "know" occurs nearly one thousand times in the Bible. In only ten instances does it mean "know sexually", and those ten refer to heterosexual intercourse. Ordinarily the word means "become acquainted with". Thisordinary meaning is perfectly appropriate to the demand of the men of Sodom. Any stranger coming to a town in ancient times had to present his credentials to the townauthorities. Lot himself was a resident alien in Sodom and had no author­ity to receive strangers (Gen. 19.9). Initially, the demand of the townsmen was legitimate; it became exorbitant when they resorted to violence. So far as the narrative itself is concerned, the sin of the men of Sodom had nothing to do with homosexuality, but much to do with violence. Many scholars continue to insist that the verb “know” in this passage has its sexual meaning in both instances; they say that it is most unlikely that the same word would be used in two senses within a single passage. That argument in itself is not strong; it is further weakened by the fact that the clearly sexual use comes second - it is only our familiarity with the story which makes us read the sexual meaning automatically into the first instance. But, allowing thatthe sexual meaning was intended, we can no more deduce a condemnation of homosexuality from a condemnation of homosexual rape than we deduce a condemnation of heterosexuality from a condemna­tion of heterosexual rape.What does the rest of the Old Testament say?In all the other books of the Old Testament there are about twenty references to the destruction of Sodom andGomorrah.  Not one of these passages gives the least reason for supposing that the writers believed thathomosexuality was even one of the causes for the destruction of the cities.There is a second story (Judges 19) which does not refer explicitly to the Sodom story, but which parallels it almost point for point, including the demand by rioters to "know" a stranger whom a resident alien is lodging overnight. The same sexual meaning is commonly read into the word here, too; only, in this case the rioters are satisfied by being given a ­woman to rape.It is clear from both the Sodom and the Judges stories that, even on the supposition that writer and reader had the sexual connotation of "know" in mind, the most that could be deduced is the sinfulness of rape.How did the Jews interpret the story?Outside the Old Testament itself, there is no evidence that the Jews read a homosexual interpretation into the Sodomstory much before the early Christian period. At that time two famous Jewish writers, Philo and Josephus, speak out against the homosexual practices common in Greco-Roman society. This cultural conflict seems to have caused an upsurge of Jewish revulsion against homosexuality and a re-reading of the Sodom story under this influence.</comment>

<comment>Next time you cut and paste pick someone who has read the whole Bible, knows archaic Hebrew, and is not picking and choosing passages to persuade people to his point of view.Leviticus:18/22  ‘You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.Now go get some asbestos panties.</comment>

<comment>The author of that article had an MA in dead languages, and was intimately familiar with the Bible.  He know far more than you, and that the Leviticus quotation means something else.  Yours are the usual malicious and dishonest sky fairy fantasies.</comment>

<comment>More sky fairy nonsense.  This author know more than you (and, unlike you, is not devoted to damaging others):The prohibitions in  the book Leviticusch. 18.22, 20.13These two verses are the only passages in the whole length of the Old Testament which prohibit and condemn a specific homosexual act: "Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind: it is abomination".  If the wording is not clinically precise, it clearly refers to homosexual inter­course, most probably anal intercourse.Are Christians obliged to abstain from everything which is prohibited in Leviticus?The book Leviticus consists of a great number of detailed instructions to the Jewish people through which they were to maintain their separateness from the Gentiles and their holi­ness before God. Almost all these regulations have been dis­carded by Christians, beginning with the decision of the apostles to require of the Gentiles nothing more than that "they abstain from pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from things strangled, and from blood"(Acts 15.20).  Most even of this remnant was soon forgotten:we do not believe that we are sinning if we eat meat with the blood in it or if we eat pork.But are not Christians still obliged to abstain from fornication - and from all sexual offenses including homosexual intercourse?Christians are still expected to discipline their sexual activity as well as all other activity; but "fornication" does not cover all the sexual prohibitions of Leviticus. Married couples, for instance, do not consider themselves bound by the menstrual regulations (Lev.15.19-33), because we have a dif­ferent and a more exact understandingof menstruation than had the Levitical writer. In the same way, homosexual couples are not bound by the homosexual prohibitions because we have a different and a more exact understanding of homo­sexuality than had the Levitical writer.Recently, evidence has come to light that early in the Christian era there was a form for solemnizing what we would now call a homosexual relationship; but through mostof Christian history, since there has been no recogni­tion of homosexual marriage, homosexual intercourse was treated on a level with other non-marital sexual acts. As the relationship between homosexuals becomes recogniz­ed asparallel to a heterosexual relationship, it becomes possible to apply to a homosexual union the discipline ex­pected in a heterosexual marriage. The prohibition of for­nication then becomes, for the homosexual couple, a prohibition of intercourse outside their own union.But is not homosexual intercourse an “abomination”?The Hebrew word translated as "abomination" is used to designate any practice characteristic of an alien culture or religion. Thus, the Hebrews are said to be an abomination to the Egyptians because they are shepherds (Gen. 46.34). To apply the term to homosexual intercourse says nothing more than that the Levitical writer considered it a practice alien to the Jewish religion.  He did not like it, just as he did not like the eating of pork; but that does not oblige us to believe that God abhors both pigs and homosexuals.But do not homosexuals deserve to be put to death?That is what the Levitical writer thought (Lev. 20.13). He also thought that a person should be put to death for cursing his parents (20.9). Many may disapprove of homosexual acts and of cursing parents; but most Christians nowadays would disapprove even more strongly of punishing them by death. The Christian community is free to decide whom to exclude from its fellowship; but it is not free to usurp God's prerog­ative of taking, as of giving, life (Luke 9.54-56).What if my conscience still tells me that I must observe the Levitical prohibition against homosexual intercourse?Then remember that Leviticus, like all the rest of the Old Testament, has nothing to say against homosexuality as a condition or against homosexual persons. The prohibitions are directed solely against homosexual intercourse. Leviticus, therefore, like all the rest of the Old Testament, gives no occasion to homosexuals to feel ashamed or guilty about their homosexuality or to think themselves prohibited from all the other natural ways in which their mutuallove can be expressed.</comment>

<comment>Gays have been in the military since day one.</comment>

<comment>Hate to remind you, but even Obama didnt support SS in 2006, and that's when Mrs. King died.</comment>

<comment>http://usatoday30.usatoday.com...</comment>

<comment>Did he say so?  Please post a link to that quote(PS interpretations by MLK's homophobic cousin third removed, father of his son in laws second wife, scholar of milk's sermons etc are not MLK saying he does not support SS marriage)</comment>

<comment>That's the point.  They never agreed with him legally speaking but were upright enough people to look past than and like him personally.  Of course, you can't comprehend that because of our hate, rage, and discontented nature.</comment>

<comment>If MLK wrote his opinions on same sex marriage or racial discrimination would you call him vile?</comment>

<comment>No, obviously, because he would have favoured the first and opposed the second, unlike Scalia.</comment>

<comment>Okay first, there's no chance MLK would have supported gay marriage. And if MLK opposed racial discrimination, why do liberals today DEMAND racial discrimination in hiring and university admissions? Would MLK want that?</comment>

<comment>Hi wife says he would have.  She knows him better than you.  You bigots have cause massive race problems in the US.  One of the ways to overcome this is to encourage black college enrollment and grauduation.  (And, in Canada, for Aboriginals.)  I can see why I have to explain this to you.</comment>

<comment>When did she say this? I remind you she's been dead for 10 years now.</comment>

<comment>You could look these things up, you know.  Anyhoo, here you go: http://www.bilerico.com/2015/0...http://usatoday30.usatoday.com...</comment>

<comment>Here's a Scalia quote,,,“There are – there are those who contend that it does not benefit African Americans to ­­ to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less­-advanced school, a less – a slower-track school where they do well.“One of – one of the briefs pointed out that – that most of the – most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they’re – that they’re being pushed ahead in – in classes that are too ­­ too fast for them.”Give me an example of what your version of " liberals today DEMAND racial discrimination"???Surley you have some evidence, some basis for your assertion?</comment>

<comment>That's hilariously anachronistic. MLK was a mid-20th century clergyman. The idea that he would have what were ultra-liberal views towards homosexuality not 5 years ago in the '60s is laughable. He dieda year before the Stonewall Riots. Support for homosexuality was nil outside a very small, heavily closeted community. </comment>

<comment>He's  special kind of amoral a**hole.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Wow, so insightful.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's hard to debate with such deep thinkers, isn't it?  :-)</comment>

<comment>I dare you to say that about a muslim. Liberal coward</comment>

<comment>Don't know any Muslim jurists.  Had a great deal of pain, though, having to deal with Christian conservatives, particularly Roman Catholics.  Unlike Scalia, though, some of those are beginning to grow up and the rest are dying off.  Hallelujah!</comment>

<comment>Wow you are sooooo tolerant!</comment>

<comment>http://www.nydailynews.com/new...</comment>

<comment>Don't know any Muslim jurists.</comment>

<comment>His religious views influenced a tiny minority of the opinions he wrote (in assent or dissent to an issue). His view of constitutional originalism and textualism was more defining for his legacy.But the fact you don't know that and single out his religion shows you to be totally ignorant of the man and his views and kind of a whack-job when it comes to religion.Then, reading your responses to people in this thread, both points are drastically reinforced (except you seem to be a whack-job about everything and not just religion).</comment>

<comment>Thanks for saving me from writing my own reply to chrisvogel.  I rarely agreed with Scalia but I respected his intellect.  I was genuinely saddened by the news of his death in a way that I wouldn't have been had the same news been about Thomas or Alito.</comment>

<comment>Couldn't agree more. Ginsburg will be a tremendous loss to the Court and society as a whole due to her status as an intellectually fierce force for judicial interpretation. Conservatives angered at the responses to Scalia's passing will write nasty, horrible things when she passes unfortunately. Chris will have a different response, I assume.</comment>

<comment>Scalia's "thoughts" were seldom more that sanctimonious and cheaply self-indulgent bitching.  He has saddled you with evil decisions that will bedevil and corrupt US social and political policy until they are repealed--the Supreme Court is good at this--but it sounds like you deserve them in the meantime.</comment>

<comment>"Scalia's "thoughts" were seldom more that sanctimonious and cheaply self-indulgent bitching."Oh, man...the irony.</comment>

<comment>Yup...IE:“There are – there are those who contend that it does not benefit African Americans to ­­ to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less­-advanced school, a less – a slower-track school where they do well.“One of – one of the briefs pointed out that – that most of the – most of the black scientists in this country don’t come from schools like the University of Texas. They come from lesser schools where they do not feel that they’re – that they’re being pushed ahead in – in classes that are too ­­ too fast for them.”</comment>

<comment>Chris:  You are filling the societally useful role of demonstrating that the right does not have a monopoly on small-mindedness.</comment>

<comment>No, but I am demonstrating that the right never is.</comment>

<comment>Shouldn't you be out packing fudge?</comment>

<comment>You seem pretty angry.  It's sad that so many of you find such joy in being disrespectful & classless. What's your deal?</comment>

<comment>It's the very thing that regress.. uh. progressive accuse others of practicingPure unadulterated hate for those who hold a view different of theirs.It's in the same class as that held by the followers of ISIS, and which ultimately lead to those behaviors that ISIS so proudly shares on the internet.</comment>

<comment>And I am, having to deal with mediocre little birks like Scalia.  As for respect, in this business you get what you earn, which in his case (and yours) is none.</comment>

<comment>Yep, you're a super rude, classless person. I advise therapy for many on here. Such hatred stems from very strong misery.</comment>

<comment>I can feel all that regress.. uh.. progressive love for those with whom they disagree.It is this very same kind of "love" that lead to the deaths of about 200,000,000 in the previous century at the hands of other so-called "progressives"And that kind of "love" is clearly the result of arrant ignorance.Carry on.</comment>

<comment>In fact (a strange concept to  you, evidently) all the great massacres are motivated by religion of one kind or another.  In addition to tne centuries of pogroms, crusades, suppression of heresies, inquisitions and witchhunts, there is the modern invention of new religions with better weapons.  Not all relgions are deist, but they all have in common the essential features, based on a Book and a Leader and a rigidly enforced doctrine that tolerates no dissent. Nazism and Stalinism were relgions as much as (a lot like monotheistic) Christianity and Islam:  not only were those who disagreed mistaken, but evil and needed to be exterminated.  All very Christian.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you need to actually think before you just blather.The democides by assorted socialist variants such as Communists, fascists, Maoists, etc. have been quite well documentedThe same goes for the butchery ascribable to islam over the last 1400 yearsAlso true for your assorted list of "pogroms, crusades, suppression of heresies, inquisitions and witchhunts..:"When the numbers add upThe islamists lead at about 280,000,000 victims over 1400 yearsThe assorted socialists are a close second at about 200,000,000 within a single century.The rest of the pack are not even in the same league.And, no. NOT "very christian".Most of the so-called wars of religion in Europe were really about temporal power in the name of religion.</comment>

<comment>Really?... the same could be said about the gay community, of course that would be a broad statement, except for those gays who use their rights as a tool to extort funds from those who would disagree with their lifestyle, using human rights to effectively negate the rights of others...how diverse.</comment>

<comment>Childish delusion and ridiculous fabrication, the essence of religion.  And, of course, what would religion be, especially for conservatives, without malicious lying?  All very Christian.</comment>

<comment>Dying made him great.</comment>

<comment>Stay classy libs.</comment>

<comment>Well, you're not wrong.Sometimes a person is so vile that their demise is a boon to progress.  Scalia fits that bill.</comment>

<comment>He had the decency to die before Alito could kill the last of the labor movement by judicially enacting right to work for public employees.</comment>

<comment>Antonin Scalia: America's #1 Activist Judge.</comment>

<comment>The most interesting thing I found out about him was he was great friends with Justice Ginsberg.  Amazing.However, I think we are at a point now in our society where the illiberal left are moving in a direction that are beginning to call people like him "extremist".  Ted Cruz has called himself a constitutionalist but they've already started on him with the extremist vitriol.Hopefully, Obama will nominate someone who reveres the Constitution as much as he did.  Hopefully, they will more moderate than the others he has nominated.   If a left wing progressive is nominated you can virtually guarantee a GOP presidency so there is that.  Seems like a tough choice for the regime.</comment>

<comment>Really, i find that hard to believe considering how he feels about womenhttps://www.aclu.org/blog/spea...Clearly in his views women are not citizens who should enjoy the rights inherent in our constitution. But then again neither are homosexuals according to himhttps://www.law.cornell.edu/su...https://www.law.cornell.edu/su...And even blacks were not actual people who deserve equal rightshttp://www.theguardian.com/law...Can't say i'll miss him</comment>

<comment>Its funny you cite an ACLU article.  Wasn't Ginsburg then and now a card carrying member?  She said some very nice things about him.  </comment>

<comment>Like i said hard to believe considering his views on women</comment>

<comment>The problem is that you divots don't know his "views on women".If anything you infer what they may be from his "legal" positions.The only problem with that, is that judges are NOT supposed to inject their personal views into their "legal" views.So if he makes a statement about a law that is from a legal point, you superficial divots presume it's a personal point</comment>

<comment>Sure because writing an opinion and filling it with such law terms as hysterical and irrelevant means nothing</comment>

<comment>The funny thing about your stupid criticism is that Scalia made an effort to always write his opinions at a level that a 1st year law student could understand.Why do you need to prove you're both ignorant and stupid ?</comment>

<comment>Probably for the same reason that you just can't stop yourself from making sure that everyone reading you is ware that you are so arrogant that you think anyone pointing out your idiocy is simply to dumb to understand your "genius"   How idiotic can you get,  you are unwilling to acknowledge Scalia's OWN words that he uttered in interviews  Sure dimwit. hysterical is totally a law term and Scalia had his opinions written by interviewers!</comment>

<comment>WowNice demonstration of childish irrational lashing out.</comment>

<comment>Says the little child who's whole "reasoning" exists out of unsubstantiated and completely irrelevant to the subject personal attacks when someone has the temerity to disagreeRight out of the gate you resort to inane name calling and pretty much nothing else</comment>

Grow up</comment>

<comment>Just to show how pathetic your attempts are...http://www.theatlantic.com/pol...-- "His majority opinions aimed for an accessible, easy-to-read tone, with occasional interjections of wit. Scalia often remarked that he wrote his opinions so that first-year law students would want to read them. And his fiery dissents made him a household name, as loved by conservatives as he was loathed by liberals."Funnier still, it was in another TheAtlantic article...Thank you for letting me demonstrate who of the two is us is, "both ignorant and stupid".Maybe you want to stop digging.</comment>

<comment><sigh>You really are not very smart, you poor thingIf he was discussing a legal issue as a "judge", he was NOT discussing it as Nino Scalia.Think on it, before you knee-jerk some more.</comment>

<comment>Read...</comment>

<comment>read........</comment>

<comment>And?Is there some rule against using actual interviews reflecting Scalia's views here?  Would you prefer some made up BS?</comment>

<comment>The biggest problem with people like you is that you're 1) ignorant of the law2) ignorant of what judges do3) More ignorantly, unable to understand that a judge has 2 persona. the legal and personal one. And that they are supposed to be 2 separate entities. A separation that the left is unable to to most of the time anyway.So when someone like Scalia is talking about the law or the Constitution, he is NOT tallking about his personal opinions or viewsHe is talking about the law..And in ALL of the above cites, the authors fail to grasp that distinction and thus presume that what Scalia says about the law is also his personal view.Which is why you goniffs are pissing into the wind when you go off on Scalia.</comment>

<comment>Oh, somebody is a bit miffed his "hero" isn't universally worshippedContrary to what you belief, your personal opinion on Scalia is not shared by all who are so enormously knowledgeable as you like to claim you are.Are you aware that your gratuitous use of unsubstantiated completely inane personal attacks only serves to illustrate how pitifully and without substance your "argument" is?Did not read tje links eh, always the case with you wingers. When someone like Scalia is asked about his personal opinions during interviews interviews. he most certainly is talking about his personal opinions when answering that. Or is it your contention that Scalia is unable to understand the simplest questions?Besides his opinion that blacks, women. homosexuals are somehow not persons under the laws is simply NOT supported by the constitution and that is why YOU and Scalia are simply pissing in the wind when you claim your personal bigotry is lawful. Nowhere in our constitution is persons defined as white heterosexual males only </comment>

<comment>Is that the best you've got ?A stupid ad hom ?You had better go back and ACTUALLY READ what Scalia had to sayThen you'll stop demonstrating your ignorance.</comment>

<comment>You better go back and learn to read links. interviews are not court rulings Get a grip</comment>

<comment>Poor baby.So desperate..So sad.</comment>

<comment>Blablabla you are stupid because you don't believe what I believe blablabla Scalia is the greatest blablabla you are soooo stupid if you don't believe me blalabla</comment>

<comment>Read....</comment>

<comment>The only thing that 'made him great'  was his demise prior to President Obama's departure from the White House.  Thankfully, that POS is gone and the country can now (hopefully) get someone in there who doesn't have a corporate/conservative bent.</comment>

<comment>The man is not even buried yet.  Classy.  It takes a big man to besmirch the dead who cannot defend themselves.</comment>

<comment>I besmirched him when he was alive. Are you telling me I have to stop now?</comment>

<comment>I understand hate knows no bounds and that is likely in your nature, carry on.</comment>

<comment>Just some constructive feedback for your comment: it didn't make a whole lot of sense.</comment>

<comment>Show us how tolerant you are!</comment>

<comment>Tolerant of what now?</comment>

<comment>Oh noes intolerant bigot pushing to pass laws legalizing his intolerance is called an intolerant bigot. How rude</comment>

<comment>When does he stop being unbesmirchable? As soon as he's buried, or is it some time after that? Will a notice be posted? If we can't besmirch him, can we at least open some champagne and celebrate his death? Maybe dance a little?If you listen closely you can hear him screaming in Hell.</comment>

<comment>Stay classy libs. Are LGBT leaders and NAMBLA supporters Harry Hay and Allen Ginsberg greeting him in hell?</comment>

<comment>Wait a minute...are you besmirching dead people?Scalia's welcome death really messes up the pseudocon game plan, eh? How in the heck are you losers going to roll back everybody's rights without a 5-4 majority? Worse yet. what are you going to do in 12 months when you've lost your majority in the Senate and Bernie nominates Hillary?</comment>

<comment>Scalia wasn't a NAMBLA supporter like two LGBT founder icons were.</comment>

<comment>But we weren't talking about them. We were talking about a homophobic, misogynistic racist. No wonder conservatives loved him.</comment>

<comment>Funny, MLK asked for people to judge by content of character, not skin color. Liberals demand racial discrimination in hiring and university admissions. who is the racist?</comment>

<comment>"...who is the racist?"Scalia.Any other questions?</comment>

<comment>How? By relaying a question someone else made in a brief?</comment>

<comment>Most of the left wingers on the Court who serves with him did not find him "vile".  If you want to take issue with his legal opinions fine.  Attacking his character, especially when evidence to the contrary exists, only denigrates your own.  But please, feel free, carry on.</comment>

<comment>"AHHHHHOOOOOWWWW....IT BURNS! IT BURNS! DEAR GOD FORGIVE ME!"- Antonin Scalia, This Morning</comment>

<comment>Easily the most intelligent thing written here today.  Can I quote that?  I need to put you in touch with my literary agent.</comment>

<comment>It's like arguing about when a fetus is a real human being.</comment>

<comment>I am not concerned in the least that that evil little man is not here to 'defend' himself.  There is no accusation and he is not on trial.  It is my opinion that he was a bad flucktard and I am glad he is gone.  And, further, I certainly don't have any grand delusion that i am able to 'besmirch' him in any meaningful way.  The opinions you have  formulated are not going to be affected by my comments, now are they?  :-)</comment>

<comment>I have no illusions that anything I write here will influence or change your mind.  At this point neither will yours.  Actually you lost any sort of argument and credibility with me when you first resorted to namecalling and epithets without making any sort of intelligent argument whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me. Are we still discussing Antonin Scalia? Or did he die and be magically replaced with someone I'm supposed to have respected?Ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>That's exactly what seems to be happening.  My Republican cousin called me to praise Scalia to the skies - what a wonderful man he was.</comment>

<comment>He's respected because he was a strong supporter of civil rights.</comment>

<comment>What made him great?  His undying love for Cheeseburgers.</comment>

<comment>Please!</comment>

<comment>If you can't undersand the simplicity and "meaning" of:  "ALL "persons" in a "jurisdiction" will be treated EQUALLY under the law," you ain't no genius, legal or otherwise,  NOR are you anything but a religiously addled anti-Freedom advocate.  Pretty simple.  RIP.  Hoping to see someone who understands that simple principle replace him.</comment>

<comment>The liberals [other than fellow bench members, who genuinely liked Scalia ], phony-baloney post-mortem posturing is already giving way to their crass hypocrisy in demanding an immediate replacement for Scalia, all forgetting, including Obama [ who demanded a filibuster of Bush picks in 2006 ], that they both embraced the nearly century old tradition of the Senates refusal to allow a nominee sent them by a lame duck POTUS, and the fact that especially with the Bork and Thomas nominations, all of the Democrats now crowing for a ''fast and fair'' nomination, dragged both men through months of mud [ ''Long Dong Silver'' indeed.... ] and neither one was the product of a lame duck.                                 Thus the GOP loses nothing by throwing a spanner into Obamas works.</comment>

<comment>1932 President Hoover nominates Ben Cordova who was confirmed. 1940 FDR nominates Frank Murphy who was confirmed. 1956 President Eisenhower appoints Brennan during Senate recess. Brennan is later Senate confirmed. Nov. 1987 President Reagan nominates Kennedy, who was confirmed in February of 1988. That's not much of a "nearly century old tradition ".Each of these basically occurred during the respective Presidents final year of their current term in office. </comment>

<comment>1. Cordova was the last one. Thus, a '' nearly century old tradition''.2. You are wrong. FDR was not a lame duck in 1940.3. You are wrong again. Ike was not a lame duck in 1956.4. You are wrong again. Kennedy was nominated well over a full year before Reagans term of office ended.I stand by my earlier position.</comment>

<comment>A lame duck, in its traditional usage, is a president whose successor has been elected.</comment>

<comment>1. What is your definition of  a century? My definition is 100 years, not 84. 2. Hoover was running for re-election. 3.FDR was running for re-election. 4. Ike was running for re-election. 5. Reagan could not run again. Time from Reagan's nomination of Kennedy til the end of Reagan's final term: 13 months. Were President Obama to make a nomination this week it would be approx. 11 months til the end of his final term. Is approximately 2 months difference the reason to try to deny a President his constitutionally mandated duty to nominate Supreme court justices?6. Please indicate where the Thurmond rule is in the Constitution, I can't seem to find it. </comment>

<comment>Clarence Thomas is better overall, but Scalia would throw in epic s**tlord lines in his dissents.</comment>

<comment>I loved the guy. Great mastery of English.</comment>

<comment>Scalia was obviously knocked off so that Obama can nominate himself to be on SCOTUS and thus rake control of both the executive and the judiciary with the willing compliance of his communist allies and the RINOS of the court.</comment>

<comment>Even Obama knows he is less qualified than Harriet Miers was.</comment>

<comment>That's what's so genius about the plans of feckless obumer, no body is prepared for the coming liberal power grab, no one but Alex Jones. </comment>

<comment>Perhaps Scalia will be "influential" in the same way that the worldwide influenza pandemic of 1918 was influential: disastrous, catastrophic, millions of lives destroyed, damaged, disrupted; but largely forgotten a century later.</comment>

<comment>Dumb.</comment>

<comment>Hmm. You've given me a lot to think about.</comment>

<comment>Their arguments are so substantive!  Impressive!</comment>

<comment>Oh you're so tolerant! How do you type with wrists that limp?</comment>

<comment>When did I ever claim to tolerate evil disguised as intellectual arrogance? Have we met? Don't you think it's kinda weird, fantasizing about some stranger's wrists? Not that there's anything wrong with that. Just not my cup of tea.</comment>

<comment>They have nothing intelligent to say so they resort to this kind of stuff.</comment>

<comment>It's a miracle by all standards.A shame, really. All that extra adipose tissue increases the rate of aromatization, the process by which free Testosterone is converted into Estradol(think man hormone transforming into woman hormone)The effects seem to be apparent.</comment>

<comment>You've obviously spent a lot of time researching these matters.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely.What piqued my interest was a longitudinal study showing T levels in men falling by nearly half on average over the course of the last 50 years. I think it's partly to blame for the move away from individualist, liberty based ideology towards more collectivist, feminized ideology in America.My advice? Cut soy out of your diet, don't microwave plastic ever, and start lifting.</comment>

<comment>And then, maybe, I'd have a chance with you? Is that what you're telling me? Let's both just be who we are. I won't change for you, you don't change for me. Okay? Plenty of fish in the sea. Cheer up.</comment>

<comment>Just doing my part to raise the collective T levels of men nationwide. Can't strengthen the country and protect liberty with a bunch of emasculated, feminized, self-flagellating moobs thwarting every effort.Then again, I'm sure in many cases 'the twins' have atrophied beyond the point of no return.... But I have faith in you!lol</comment>

<comment>And you're so intelligent!  You've given me much to contemplate.  Hope you'll have some further pearls of wisdom to bestow upon us.</comment>

<comment>The most stupid thing I read this year.  Millions of lives destroyed, sure OK.  Back under your rock, you might need to lose weight first to fit under it.</comment>

<comment>Insults are all you've got.</comment>

<comment>In that one instance perhaps, but there is more.</comment>

<comment>I wasted a minute or two looking over your recent comments. Insult, insult, insult. The first instance of "more" is a month back when you have something nice to say. About a Beretta pistol grip. So, yeah, I think Metis has got you pegged.</comment>

<comment>Besides which, you're a hypocrite. You condemn others for speaking ill of people they've never met, yet as far as I know you have no idea whatsoever how much room there is beneath my rock. If you did, you'd know it's quite spacious, even for a lardass such as myself. That's just how I roll.</comment>

<comment>Got your fat dander up did I?  You will not be invited over for a shooting date, sweetheart!</comment>

<comment>Well, you will allow me one ad hominem in your instance.  It was perhaps warranted and maybe deserved.  I really like the pistol grip, what can I say.  I am so much more accurate now. It was a brief personal aside.</comment>

<comment>well?  What's more?  I'm waiting.</comment>

<comment>Busy.  Maybe later.</comment>

<comment>If you think that's bad, how do you feel about "Mere factual innocence is no reason not to carry out a death sentence properly reached" ?</comment>

<comment>Really???  Scalia wrote that?</comment>

<comment>Ya' gotta' give us a cite for that.</comment>

<comment>Google is your friend.https://www.google.com/search?...</comment>

<comment>Here's what I got:http://news.lawreader.com/2008...</comment>

<comment>I read that. It includes these words: "The misquote is generally correct." So, we're quibbling about how he said it, not that he did say it. No?</comment>

<comment>Smack on. I wonder if they'll make the location of his grave public?</comment>

<comment>'...that they called to mind the hated general warrants and writs of assistance that the framers of the Fourth Amendment meant to prohibit.'  Those last three words are the tricky part.This writer knows his stuff and acknowledges that scalia was not the constitutional purist ted 'crazy' cruz or others are suggesting.   Above all else, he could be counted upon for allowing his religious views to shape his judicial decisions, which is precisely why cruz and others want a replica.Mourn his death, but in the name of civil liberty, celebrate his vacated seat.</comment>

<comment>Liberals despise the first amendment and second amendment. They say the constitution is a living document, but refuse the use the process of making it "living and changing" because amending it isn't as easy as having a liberal impose their view.</comment>

<comment>HA!Clearly Penguin, you're unaware of Scalia's ruling in DC vs Heller. :)</comment>

<comment>Haha yep. He pretty much disregarded U.S. v Miller.</comment>

<comment>He read the words of the constitution. Kinda like how liberals argue the death penalty is cruel and unusual punishment. IF that were the case, why does the constitution say you cannot take away LIFE, liberty or property without DUE PROCESS?? Notice the first thing they said is LIFE.</comment>

<comment>Oh come now, Penguin.If you really believed in the Constitution, you'd demand all gun owners be part of a well-regulated militia.  Instead, we see these 400 pound, open carry activists walking around in camo pretending to be soldiers because they can't pass a military physical.</comment>

<comment>I guess you ignore the other part of the second amendment. Also, what is the point of gun rights being in the hand of a state  national g uard when the president can nationalize them? Defeats the point of the second amendment.</comment>

<comment>So, YOU don't like the Second Amendment, clearly, do you?I mean... you clearly want to be able to pick and choose, demonstrated by your reply.  The founding fathers would be ashamed of you. </comment>

<comment>Good riddance.Thank you Nature for providing where man and the Constitution failed.  No one should be entitled to a lifetime appointment, especially of such power, and with such excessive living.People are people, and none deserve such exalted status over others.Liberal or Conservative - his time was far overdue.</comment>

<comment>You sound like a liberal, because you could call for an amendment to limit terms, but you won't, because it's not as easy as having a liberal write law from the bench.</comment>

<comment>How did man and Constitution fail exactly?  Another incoherent progressive!</comment>

<comment>Dear death panels:Well done!</comment>

<comment>Scalia restored the court to its original, conservative role in government after the liberal Warren court finished off some civil rights business left unresolved after the Civil War.  He understood that his role was not to legislate - that's the job of the legislatures.  He is a great man and I hope his replacement will have the same respect for constitutional values and not turn the Supreme Court into a Supreme Caliphate who base their decisions on their own secular-pious self-righteousness.</comment>

<comment>'...turn the Supreme Court into a Supreme Caliphate who base their decisions on their own secular-pious self-righteousness.'Interesting, because that is precisely what scalia did.   The poor understanding fright wingers have of their own kin is laughable.</comment>

<comment>In fact he respected the people to such an extent that he gave them the right and responsibility to change the laws for themselves via the legislature instead of handing down laws from on high like a king.  The temptation to assume power is strong, this is a fundamentally American and Constitutional concept, and he understood and respected it.  He should be admired and remembered for that.</comment>

<comment>He did not even respect his own colleagues, regularly slating them with personal insults in his decisions.  You hold a distorted view based on your political outlook.  Not healthy.</comment>

<comment>Haha, so I see in order to be correct he'd have to 'respect' everyone.  This is the result of safe space indoctrination, and shows why it's so dangerous.  In fact, if you disagree with someone, you are well within your rights to excoriate their opinion.  You don't have to act nice about it either.  Of course, you can't bully and insult people either.  Also he was supposedly very friendly with RBG.</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a true trumpeteer.  Sounds like you are the life of the party.</comment>

<comment>Trump would eviscerate the Bill of Rights if he could.  "'Oh freedom of speech, freedom of speech.' These are foolish people.”</comment>

<comment>You have the perspective of one whose only relationships are on the internet. I encourage you to mix with real people, perhaps pop down to your local and try out your excoriating line with a few strangers.  See if that helps you make new friends.</comment>

<comment>Admittedly I am not the life the party.  If that is your goal then fine.  But its not a quality I look for in a Supreme Court justice, so thanks at least for the opportunity to point that out.</comment>

<comment>Well, everyone should know their limitations, but at the same time not be  bound by them.  Try real humans, in the main they are fun.Reading the Constitution is not a difficult thing.  We could write software and have a computer apply it without much difficulty.  I would prefer humans with life experience sit on the court.</comment>

<comment>Interesting reply.  I am somewhat intrigued that you make this personal.  And I would point out the hypocrisy that your comment count is closing in on 6000.  Your argument is a variation of "You can't understand because you don't know real humans."  In fact that is the central point here, Scalia should not be discredited just because he didn't make a 'safe space' for the other judges.  In fact, he was respected by the other justices for his bluntness.  Again, this is another reason that I respect the guy, even if you can figure out another personal line of attack intended to discredit me that only ends up proving my point:</comment>

<comment>He was not respected by other jurists for the insults, but because in private he had a very different personality (very funny, gregarious etc).  You are not speaking with knowledge about your subject.Apologies if you feel this is a personal attack; I am only responding to your personal views. However, it is ironic that the guy who likes excoriating others when he disagrees with them takes such affront when he is himself called out for being wrong.i'll leave you to it from here, enjoy.</comment>

<comment>Heh.  There are so many hypocrisies in your comments I don't know where to start.  You fault him for his blistering rulings by saying that he wasn't making friends with his fellow justices.  But this is not and has never been a criteria for being a good justice.  Sometimes you need to 'excoriate'.  But then you come here and gratuitously insulted me by saying I spend too much time on the internet and therefore don't understand people (when obviously you spend even more, based on your comment history).  Which again is fine but the hypocrisy is that it's fine for you to do it but the same behavior makes Scalia a bad justice?  Haha sorry.  You don't have to apologize for the 'personal attack' because first of all you don't know me so it can't be personal and secondly you are not sorry in the least.  Finally, you say you will leave me to it from here, so stick to your word, or continue to demonstrate your hypocrisy, up to you:</comment>

<comment>How exactly did one of nine do this exactly?  Please cite some evidence to that ridiculous claim.</comment>

<comment>You're on the net, next time let your own fingers do the walking.This is from this very magazine: http://www.theatlantic.com/mag...This is from a 'neutral' source: http://news.yahoo.com/scalia-d...And here is one from your kind of publication: http://www.washingtontimes.com...</comment>

<comment>Not even close to your hyperbolic statement.  He was influenced by his own life experience!  Whoa.  A 'wise latina" comes to mind which is way worse in my mind.</comment>

<comment>Completely supportive of my post.  Sorry if reading skills are not your forte.</comment>

<comment>You are totally off base.  A Caliphate!  With the radical secularists running about it is actually going very quickly in the opposite direction.</comment>

<comment>What made Antonin Scalia "great" forever in my mind is: He was found dead with a pillow over his head!!</comment>

<comment>Watch out what you cheer for.  Dame Ginsburg is likely within shouting distance of an "untimely" exit from the court.  Not sure you will see the same bile spewed from the right on her demise...</comment>

<comment>It wasn't me that put a pillow on his head. I have never slept with a pillow over my head! The left seems to be the ones spewing and stewing on a replacement that is unprecedented in an election year. If Democrats cared about the people's voices, they would let the people decide by their vote. Our President and Our Senate did not wait for the body to even get cold. It reminded me of the monsters around Kennedy's death.</comment>

<comment>Lady: it was mcconnell, a republican, who politicised his death, making the first public statement by an elected official, and before any statement was made by the White House.  All the President's spokesman has said is that the President will fulfil his Constitutional obligation by nominating a replacement.PS  one of Reagan's nominations, approved in his last year, sits on the Court today.</comment>

<comment>"Not sure you will see the same bile spewed from the right on her demise..."Then you're either delusional, stupid, or both </comment>

<comment>Apparently, he begged off early the night before his hunting party was putting away a few beers, claiming poor health.  No one even bothered to check in on him the next day before they set off for the shoot without him.With friends like that...</comment>

<comment>I find a pillow on his head quite weird. I don't sleep with a pillow on my head or chest. I want my brain and my melons to breathe.</comment>

<comment>He might have been in pain, who knows and I don't find dwelling on it fruitful.  I did think it significant that a group would have an SC jurist in their party and yet not be concerned enough to check after he fails to join them for the very thing they came together to do.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, they should have checked in on him. It would have been nice if they did an autopsy. I heard the coroner pronounced him dead over the phone.</comment>

<comment>I always put a pillow over my head.My gf laughs at my burrowing instincts.</comment>

<comment>It's unnatural for breathing purposes.  Sometimes, I will put my head between two pillows while I have a headache but never in bed. I try not to sleep on my back because you can cut off your breathing. If one cuts off their breathing...normally your body will flip over with the exception of the brain being incapacitated, due to drinking. The next reaction if the person doesn't flip, is the person could and does throw up. The person can asphyxiate on their vomit. Was there any vomit found?  Was he dead before the pillow was placed on his head? We'll never know because no autopsy was done.  If I recall right, Dr. Michael Baden stated a person gets these red dots around their mouths when they are suffocated. But since the coroner wasn't there, how would she know?  It amazes me that a man this famous and she rules from a phone? It doesn't feel right. :(</comment>

<comment>Like I said, I always do, to block out light and noise.I shared a room for the first 16 years of my life though so this could be a learned trait.</comment>

<comment>Could be...I had five children and 9 grandchildren and I have never seen a baby put a pillow on their head. I have slept with my hubby for thirty years and I know he doesn't do that. He snores so I wake up and see him sleeping. Once his snoring got into my dream. We were hiding from the Germans in my dream...I told him in the dream to pretend like he was sleeping so he said, okay...closed his eyes and started snoring. It made the Germans stop and look at our direction pointing their guns...That made me wake up to the real world and there was my hubby snoring as loud as can be. What it proved is,  outside influences can perpetrate into your dreams.</comment>

<comment>Gone too soon. But then again, most murder victims are.RIP Antonin Scalia.</comment>

<comment>Murdered by his gluttonous appetite </comment>

<comment>His opinions were as antiquated as 1936 Ford Humpbacks.</comment>

<comment>You are right he and the Constitution were/ are antiquated like an old truck.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps at one time he was "great", but he had clearly turned into an old grandpa that drools over Fox News:"There are those who contend that it does not benefit African-Americans to get them into the University of Texas where they do not do well, as opposed to having them go to a less-advanced school, a less—a slower-track school where they do well.  One of the briefs pointed out that most of the black scientists in this country don't come from schools like the University of Texas."Comments like this are sickening.</comment>

<comment>Yes, a justice asking an appellant to address arguments contained in an amicus brief is so sickening.</comment>

<comment>Some defend the constitution. Some use the constitution to defend their prejudices. In Scalia's case it is perhaps difficult to judge what he was up to. In any case I suspect he did not quite understand the meaning of 'cruel and unusual' punishment - for what could be more cruel than the death penalty?</comment>

<comment>Then why does it also say that you cannot take life, liberty or property without due process? Why have "life" included in there if you cannot execute people?</comment>

<comment>Some states... principled states... do not execute people.  Others, like yourself, prefer to cherry pick the parts they like, just as they do with their religion.</comment>

<comment>It, as you say, does not actually compel you to take life. But seems to me that there are two ways of looking at it;1. that due process automatically requires you to consider the implication of the constitutional ban on cruel punishment in your sentencing; and2. that the framers failed to think things through.</comment>

<comment>I don't have a problem for the death penalty to those who don't respect the right to life of others.They don't deserve that which they took from others unjustly.I'll also point out thtat there are multiple references to capital punishment in the Constitution, so clearly the Framers did not consider it "cruel and unusual".You are a clear example of one who wants to creatively interpret the Constitution to your values, instead of hewing to what the framers wrote down.If you want to change that, it's called the Amendment Process.Because if the meaning of the law can change according to fashion-du-jour, then the law has no meaning.And when that happens, things go into the shitter real fast.Venezuela is a recent example of that.Where El Presidente Chavez, had a  judge, Maria Lourdes Afiuni,  jailed because he didn't like her decision.</comment>

<comment>The fact that we still have free speech and freedom of religion in this country can be credited in part to Scalia's wisdom and persistence.  These are the most fundamental rights, because without them you can't even fight for others without fear of persecution.  The story of American is about people fighting for their rights and then earning them.  (Yes, I said 'earning' - you earn your rights, and the deaths of millions of brave Americans who fought for this principle prove it.)</comment>

<comment>I agree with the sentiment of your post but can't help think of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula the author of that video that supposedly sparked the Benghazi 'protests'.  This man was imprisoned for speaking his mind.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure Scalia would reject that, and even if the religions were reversed.  But it shows that "Speech can incite violence" is a fallacy.</comment>

<comment>From the Caribbeans via Palestine to South America, Asia, Africa and Europe, the story of American (sic) is about people fighting to extinguish other peoples' rights.</comment>

<comment>True.  We need to export our values to other parts of the world.  Including Europe, which doesn't enjoy free speech.  In fact, that is source of their current problems - anyone who spoke out against the muslim influx was charged with 'hate speech'.</comment>

<comment>I should hope that you have some trust in the judicial systems prevailing in Europe, if for no other reason that the US system is a pale imitation of one or more of those. However more apt would be for these people to be charged with the idiocy of opposing the natural order of things which is that it is a time honoured tradition for humans to move from one place to another as circumstances demand. Jewish people have done that from time immemorial  thus causing problems for which others are still paying with life and liberty. Europeans have done that in an industrial scale and that is how they ended  up like a swarm of locusts in among other places, the US, thereby  causing immense loss of life. Today the Indians from the sub-continent are also arriving in droves.</comment>

<comment>Right to Bear Arms as well. The Heller and McDonald rulings have to be two of the greatest wins for the Bill of Rights in this century.</comment>

<comment>Chrisvogel where is your proof that Coretta Scott King said MLK supported gay marriage?</comment>

<comment>Took all of two seconds to find.It's time for you to learn how to use a search engine, Penguin.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry - by "clarity" did you mean "cattywompus"? Because he couldn't find a position on the constitution that he like for longer than a year or two. Or maybe it depended on the cases that came up; somehow, he always found a constitutional basis for things his party wanted. Even if he contradicted himself from a year earlier.He was an idiot, a hypocrite, and what's even worse, a cruel, cruel man. The world is better with him gone out of it.</comment>

<comment>tolerance!</comment>

<comment>I wonder what people will say of you when you're gone....</comment>

<comment>I won't and don't care. I said this about him while he was alive, living under a bridge, being a garbage person.</comment>

<comment>He was a slimy piece of crap. Good riddance. </comment>

<comment>If it's possible to fail an IQ test, I am sure it happened to you. </comment>

<comment>Only losers with inferiority complexes would waste their time taking a test that gains you nothing.  Oh I guess that describes you perfectly. </comment>

<comment>Libs, who was worse, Scalia or Terry Bean?</comment>

<comment>Scalia.  Terry is just confused </comment>

<comment>Terry bean had sex with a child, then paid the child off to not testify in court at his trial, so the charges were dropped.</comment>

<comment>I thought you were talking about the commenter whee frequents this site.  I have no idea who Terry Bean is. I assume you are not talking about the commenter </comment>

<comment>Terry bean is the founder of the Human Rights Campaign. He was such a big Obama donor that he got to fly on Air Force One. He and his boyfriend had sex with an underage boy, then paid off the victim to not testify, so that charges were dropped. the National media chose to ignore the story.</comment>

<comment>I know this just makes me so angry.  What do you think we should we do about it?</comment>

<comment>Just repeat the story, and make liberals stop ignoring things, horrible things, simply because a Democrat did it.</comment>

<comment>OK: Terry bean is the founder of the Human Rights Campaign. He was such a big Obama donor that he got to fly on Air Force One. He and his boyfriend had sex with an underage boy, then paid off the victim to not testify, so that charges were dropped. the National media chose to ignore the story.How'd I do?</comment>

<comment>No.Post proof.Repeating a lie over, and over, and over again proves nothing.</comment>

<comment>Kinda sounds like the Duggars but without the incest bit. Disgusting </comment>

<comment>Wow...Sounds like he should be a republican congressman. He would fit right in.</comment>

<comment>Er, just did a quick google search, and charges were dropped against Bean.Not a word anywhere about payoffs... do you have proof of that or are you making stuff up? (As usual.)</comment>

<comment>He sounds nasty, like the Duggars </comment>

<comment>Proof, please?</comment>

<comment>How about bagger Roy Bean, the hanging judge from the olden days?</comment>

<comment>Scalia, obviously.You keep bringing up Terry Bean and making assertions, but haven't given us an ounce of proof about them.  Scalia, on the other hand, was very, very proud of the horrible things he did to people.</comment>

<comment>For a group of people so focused on 'tolerance', leftists are some of the cruelest people I know.  This forum being a great example.Funny how anonymity online brings out the real person and sad just how mean spirited they can be.</comment>

<comment>True but I saw you gratuitously insult someone as well.</comment>

<comment>You should see their posts on twitter. Nastiest stuff.</comment>

<comment>Nasty people deserve nasty eulogies </comment>

<comment>He was well liked by all on the Court including Ginsburg and respected as a giant on the court by all. Get a clue Phil. </comment>

<comment>They're all a bunch of clowns in robes.  I have no respect for any of them.  The legal system in this country is a sick joke, and they are just another symptom </comment>

<comment>Phil you need a new hobby, as you really are not too bright! </comment>

<comment>You're an idiot with a meaninglessness opinion. I'll comment where I like </comment>

<comment>w/e</comment>

<comment>I would suggest you go back to Teen Magazine or Boys Life as those publications fit both your maturity and intellect! </comment>

<comment>Whatever.  You can go back to Braitbart or Fox where imbeciles like you are the norm </comment>

<comment>Scalia is said to have been an engaging conversationalist. Scalia was a villain of his profession. The two behaviors do not conflict.(See also Ronald Reagan)</comment>

<comment>Ironically, even those in his profession who held views opposite to his spoke highly of him both as a jurist and a person.The only people smearing him are ignorant little wannabe twerps, who've crawled out of the woodwork.But an important point is that a direct result of his presence was a major turn toward using the letter of the law as the primary source for making judgements, that even the liberals on SCOTUS are now doing.Scalia will prove to be the equivalent of a Tsunami whose effect has changed the lay of the (legal) land. and will continue to have repercussions for generations.</comment>

<comment>He was not a nasty person.</comment>

<comment>That must be why Ginsburg considered him her best bud..Because he was such a nasty man..Uh-huh..</comment>
