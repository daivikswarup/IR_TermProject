<comment>Walker's in Pawlenty of trouble.</comment>

<comment>Close the thread. Lost in the Stars already won it.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  200 up arrows.</comment>

<comment>Now that just made my month.</comment>

<comment>Walker's obviously ambitious and he may have good political antennae to eek out electoral majorities in the Badger State, but he is clearly not knowledgeable about policy and out of his league at the POTUS level. He's got some political savvy but he's just not very smart and has made too many gaffes to be considered seriously now.  And stylistically he exudes a very odd combination of being sleepy yet also weaselly and nasty -- Eddie Haskell with a shiv.  I think Walker's finished.</comment>

<comment>And about as smart as Lumpy Rutherford</comment>

<comment>Just like Paul Ryan was able to carry Wisconsin?</comment>

<comment>"Eddie Haskell with a shiv"Love the visual.</comment>

<comment>I'm a little disappointed that the usual conservative flacks aren't around here to defend Walker.  JohnJMac, where are you?The Republican party and associated conservative groups had a really well organized plan to take over Wisconsin, starting with the state Supreme Court.  Walker was just part of the picture, sort of a final piece of the puzzle.  The state Democratic party is pretty ineffectual these days by contrast.It's been a minor pleasure watching Scott stumble all over himself on the national scene, the in-state press was pretty wimpy on pressing him on anything substantial.  Until The Donald came on the scene, Walker seemed to get by ok playing the victim with his dumber pronouncements, claiming "gotcha" questioning.  That seems to not be wearing very well anymore.</comment>

<comment>Don't you know a loser when you see one?</comment>

<comment>Walker? I'm willing to call Walker many things, but I won't allow myself to call him that until he's no longer my governor.  Until then, the primary losers are my fellow Wisconsinites.</comment>

<comment>Hey! My Avatar resembles that remark!</comment>

<comment>It sure would help Mr. Walker if WI's economy wasn't terrible right now as a direct result of his policies.</comment>

<comment>It's hard to win the race to the bottom, when there are states that have already been at the bottom for centuries.</comment>

<comment>And sadly, rebranding as "Wississippi" hasn't proved to be the winning strategy.</comment>

<comment>The fact that 40% of the voters in Wisconsin---per the latest poll---approve him is mind boggling and baffling.  Can they all be dumber than him?</comment>

<comment>I protested against Walker in Madison, but it's really not that difficult to understand Walker's support.First, there are a lot of people who are struggling financially.  They saw jobs disappearing and wages going down.  At the same time, they saw their taxes going up.What they didn't see was public schools or universities suffering the way they were.  They saw public workers as being in a protected bubble that they were paying for.  Walker was appealing to these people.Secondly, the Democrats haven't been very strong in getting out a successful message or providing solid candidates.I'm not suggesting Walker was a solution to their fears or a solution at all, but education in Wisconsin refuses to acknowledge the harsh realities that others are experiencing in Wisconsin.  That provided Walker with a huge opportunity.</comment>

<comment>Thanks---but that was then and this is now.  He caused a lot of damage since he was elected.</comment>

<comment>Sure he has.  But the harm he's done doesn't hurt the very rich or the very poor.  Well, it doesn't hurt the poor right away anyway - and they're used to getting dumped on so it's no big deal.When you don't see a future for yourself but you see your tax dollars paying others so they can have good health insurance, a better salary than their own, and you hear them complaining about how rough they have it - which may be true but still isn't nearly as bad as they have it themselves, you are going to get resentment and anger.And...we are seeing a shift in Wisconsin.  A lot of conservatives have begun to change their views since the Bucks Deal and Walker's complete lack of commitment to Wisconsin.In the end, though, people are really frustrated paying for a protected class of people while they're paying their salaries and working in a much riskier environment.</comment>

<comment>yup, and so he was elected with a republican majority and now Wisconsin is 47th in job growth, their great universities are suffering, public education is damaged, which will hurt the state for years to come.  these idiots who elected and re-elected him, it's like they had a serious cut on their arm and so they just cut their arm off and now they don't know why they are in pain.</comment>

<comment>That's not an incorrect position, but it's not one of understanding either.Yes.  He damaged Wisconsin, but those struggling workers were never going to see any major improvements if things stayed the same or even if things improved slightly.I am as anti-Walker as anyone, but "these people" aren't idiots.  They are frustrated workers and business owners who correctly assess that the public sector worker is out of touch with the reality of those who provide and collect taxes for the public sector.In my mind the liberals in Wisconsin failed.  They failed to put up good candidates and failed to put out a cohesive message that showed they understood the (relative) economic plight of the people who pay their wages.I still see a lot of public workers who just don't realize how much people in the private sector - business owners and employees, are struggling just to stay afloat and how their jobs are not at all secure.</comment>

<comment>Spot On! Thank you Janet. From one Wisconsinite to another.</comment>

<comment>This resentment of public employees is actually a platform plank in the Republican's populist rebranding.  I have to admit that such employees are enjoying a bit of rentier privilege.</comment>

<comment>Yep...the ole Divide and Conquer strategy...SHAMEFUL!</comment>

<comment>Hey Uncle, you know the 3 things it takes to win elections and the order they need to be in? Well let me tell ya in this order...MONEY,MONEY, and VOTES. That's how Walker won in Wisconsin, Plain and Simple!</comment>

<comment>Beautiful.</comment>

<comment>Great line, lits.But Mr Pawlenty and Mr Walker fail for two very different reasons.Tim Pawlenty is instant rolled oats with warm water poured over. Scott Walker is manure stew with glass shards.</comment>

<comment>I myself much prefer Kasich  over Walker[although i don't think that Kasich will win]But I also think that one shouldn't put too much trust in polls this early in the election. I seem to remember Michelle Bachmann being very high in the polls    in 2011</comment>

<comment>Kasich has actually done a good job as Governor, something the other Governors running for President can't even begin to claim.</comment>

<comment>Kasich wanted to do the same thing walker did but there was a revolt and he changed his mind.</comment>

<comment>He and all Ohioians should thank their lucky stars for that result. Otherwise they'd be in the same mess as WI and KS? Will these idiots never learn that trickle down doesn't work and that cutting education funding is a very short-sighted move.</comment>

<comment>Wisconsin didn't do any trickle down nonsense.  They just cut teachers' and other state employees' salaries by 7% or something and barred future increases by anything more than the rate of inflation.</comment>

<comment>Haha</comment>

<comment>Respectfully, I would suggest you look at his overall record as governor.  "Actually done a good job" is somewhat pushing it.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you up to a point, Pete; polls this early aren't usually a good indicator of what's actually going to happen. Last time around, Michelle Bachmann led the polls for a while, as did Rick Perry, Herman Cain, and Newt Gingrich. The difference is that last time around, their time at the top of the polls could be measured in days and weeks before their obvious disqualifications for the job led to a precipitous drop in the polls. This time, Donald Trump has remained at the top of the polls for several months now and only seems to be gaining in popularity, despite being probably the least qualified presidential candidate in the nation's history.I'm with you, though. I hope it turns out to be Kasich for the Republicans, although I'm afraid he's entirely too sane for what's become an increasingly rabid primary electorate.</comment>

<comment>polls this early aren't usually a good indicator of what's actually going to happen.Polls this early in the campaign help weed out those not qualified. As you do mention however, Trump is an anomaly.</comment>

<comment>I dunno. I hope so. I can't tell if he's an anomaly or if he's the logical end point of the Tea Party takeover of the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Trump is an unlikely match for Tea Party fiscal conservatism but he's caught the wave of the revolt against the sellout GOP Leadership in DC.</comment>

<comment>Used to be that candidates at the bottom of the polls would be broke by now and bail out. Thanks to the sugar daddies out there courtesy of SCOTUS they seem to be all in for the long haul. Want to start a book on whose going to be the fist to go? My guess is Perry</comment>

<comment>Perry does have some name recognition. There are a few others though, who's mothers know their names, that will drop out first. Of the name candidates, Gingrich would be my first choice but him or Perry.Some unknown names:John Dummet, an unknown with a Tea Bagger hard on. Hates the world.George Baily, a preacher. Loves god, hates gays, queers, homos, and faggots.Bart James Lower, a one platform ijit. Also known as BJ Lower.Chris Hill, a veteran who crosses party lines. Known best by his mother and car mechanic.Ross Newland. ---. Other than that, no one knows.James Mitchell, likes guns and law enforcement. Hates darker complexion folk.Brian Russell, Ummm, OK. Jim Gilmore, former governor of Virginia and an original Gilmore Girl.Eric Cavanaugh, wants a 100% Porn tax. He lost my vote.Jim Hayden, he ran in 2012 too. If you remember. If you don't, no problem.And on and on. http://2016.republican-candida... These nimrods will be the first to drop out when they can't even afford a hotel room in Iowa or New Hampshire.</comment>

<comment>done</comment>

<comment>I agree; Trump's rise feels different than Cain et al.</comment>

<comment>There aren't women coming out of the wood work, saying they had an affair with Trump.  Which ended Cain's run.</comment>

<comment>I think Trump just married them all, one by one.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Trump can possibly beat Obama in the least qualified department. All Obama ever did was sell his own promise to guilty white liberals. At least Trump also had a business career where actual buildings got built.</comment>

<comment>u  r  a  moron</comment>

<comment>Hi Michelle.</comment>

<comment>And at this point in 2007, McCain's campaign was dead and buried.I hope Scott Walker finds his feet. It's plain that the transition from statewide to national races is not an easy one, and not all governors can make the transition. Those candidates who have not occupied in running a state have had more time to bone up on national issues.</comment>

<comment>According to Dr. Sykes, the reason Walker appears to be taking multiple positions on the same issue, for example on birthrights, is that poor man suffers from a newly discovered condition known as verbal tics. This little known affliction causes him to say "yes" when he really means "no" but only sometimes and not always. There has been an outbreak of the disease in Wisconsin among republican politicians as Sen. Ron Johnson is infected as well, although to a lesser degree. Perhaps some sort of insect spray might help.</comment>

<comment>yeah, the condition is 'sykes up his ass' syndrome</comment>

<comment>Walker is out of his league. He has the charisma of a buried corpse and unlike Trump or Rubio, this means he can't charm his way past his dumb statements and that he just has to sit there and take the punches like Jeb Bush or Jindal.Walker also started getting played he started trying to be phony. Disney movies don't lie be yourself, Walker tried acting like a refined statesman and came off as an incompetent bore and when tried to lose 40 IQ points and sound like Trump, he failed and chose to build a wall against my favorite American state, Canada 😜.It's funny, he's the Republican version of Martin O'Malley to an extent in terms of bad campaigning.TL;DR Walker needs to shake that ass, spend that Koch money like a drunken sorority girl and be himself.</comment>

<comment>he's ALWAYS been phony.</comment>

<comment>True. And his disdain for the middle class shows through pretty plainly in his actions.</comment>

<comment>That's because he is so lower class himself.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, Walker never had 40 IQ points to spare:)</comment>

<comment>The Kochs could have found some poor SOB to lend him a few.</comment>

<comment>The Kochs have proven that, while they can buy / control state and local politicians quite easily, they completely suck in regards to choosing an idiot as their POTUS candidate.</comment>

<comment>So true. However, I'm thinking they had Kansas's Brownback in mind for 2020 if they lose 2016. Well, maybe, we''ll see how that race ends up when the Kansas Supreme Court is done with him.</comment>

<comment>Yeah even at the state and local level they are running into trouble. Kansas is a mess and everyone outside sees it. WI isn't much better and their local level efforts are seen b many at the local level as being seen as outside actors trying to tell small towners how to run their lives..</comment>

<comment>Good point.</comment>

<comment>... and it's been a brilliantly executed strategy thus far.Team Koch realized that control over the legislature ensures control over the policy debate. Remember the progenitor of all policy is the Legislature _not_ the Executive branch.Also, they've taken a very long view. Think about it as a portfolio risk problem.The 'farm leagues' for the national races are the local and state elections.   The more candidates I fund at that level, the greater the chance that one (or more) of my victorious candidates will break out and hit the national stage.  If I have several individuals from the farm team playing at the national level -- does your choice actually matter?</comment>

<comment>You got that right as far as Walker acting like a Disney movie villain as far as his time as governor.</comment>

<comment>Walker is a shill for the right wing extremist billionaires. He doesn't even do a good job of hiding it. They want to kill unions. He does it proudly. They want to cut public school budget. He does it proudly. They want hundreds of million of tax payer money for a sports stadium. He does it proudly.My god, no subtlety at all.</comment>

<comment>there is no way you can trust this guy. he has zero credibility now</comment>

<comment>All the brains and charisma of a Ziploc bag half full of styrofoam peanuts.</comment>

<comment>Trump now getting a good chunk of the Dems minority voters so it's more than Walker that have to worry.---------------------------------------From the article - Trump actually wins a good share of the non-white base, which is usually something the Democrats end up getting. 25 percent of African-Americans would vote for Trump, along with 31 percent of Hispanics, and 41 percent of the Asian vote. This is huge because the “non-white” group and the “people of color” group has always been a more Democratic leaning group.http://gazettereview.com/2015/...</comment>

<comment>I have zero faith in any polling done solely by robocalling, as is the case with SurveyUSA.</comment>

<comment>"Go f$&k yourself, i'm eating you @$$hole" is the actual winner of that poll.</comment>

<comment>That, or once Caller ID displays an unrecognizable number, my voice mail takes the poll for me.</comment>

<comment>WOW, I'm impressed at the persuasiveness of your argument. Your logic is just so overwhelmingly insightful. Does mommy know you're on her computer again?</comment>

<comment>To be fair, that's the response I've given to many pollsters that have interrupted me over the years.</comment>

<comment>None of the other polls show these results.  What most of the polls and interviews show is Trump is supported by the extremist right, many white Supremest types and non-voters. While Trump leads the GOP in polls of most favorable he also leads polls for the GOP as the most unfavorable at near 49%. That means that far more people will vote against Trump then for him.</comment>

<comment>Don't look now, but Trump just one a head-to-head SurveyUSA poll against Hillary Clinton while getting 25% of the black vote. As for Trumps fav/unfav numbers, they were a lot worse 6 months ago. None of the usual rules operate for The Donald.</comment>

<comment>Yep, he one it fare and skwair!</comment>

<comment>Hey look if you want to get on the Trump bandwagon go ahead. Its a year and a half before any election. Trump in the first Republican debate had to resort to insults because he not only does not have any policy what he thinks he has he can't even explain and has to resort to adolescent behavior and say BS that he was set up.  It plays to the extremist right very well, because they are well extremist and for the most part not the most educated, and for the most part have to resort to totally made up names to even post.  I could care less about Hillary at this point in time and like most Americans its way too far away to even consider.  I simply stated the factual of the current polls. In 1968 RFK entered the race after the primaries had already started, not only did he win every primary after he entered he was a lock to win the nomination.  He entered the '68 race with less than 6 months to go.  I wouldn't get so high and mighty about Trump, actual voters will want to know specifics and not just rhetoric, and right now he is just a lot of hot wind for very intelligent people the same types that liked Sarah Palin.  They didn't get it then and still seem unable to get it now!!!</comment>

<comment>There *should* be a wall on the northern border; that's the border across which Kinder eggs get smuggled.</comment>

<comment>Seems like some benighted attitudes of non-coastal America have run into the fact that this is not a benighted country overall. Comeuppance.</comment>

<comment>He has been Trumped, much more so than Jeb!!??!</comment>

<comment>It's tough when you run out of ALEC supplied quips to dribble in front of the rubes.</comment>

<comment>No, no one can save him.  He is what he is.  A clueless narcissistic numbnut who has been fleecing Wisconsin citizens for the last 23 years with the help of Milwaukee right wing media who at this minute are STILL blowing their brass horns for him.Just one big old Fools Parade from Wisconsin.</comment>

<comment>I probably would have put it differently, but that's about it.</comment>

<comment>In answer to the question......no, he is probably doomed as a 2016 candidate for President.</comment>

<comment>No one plans to vote for him.</comment>

<comment>Thanks to top-qualify Koch funded coaching on foreign affairs knowledge, Walker can now point to Canada on a map of the world.  Ask him to do it on a round globe though and all bets are off.</comment>

<comment>As we are fond of saying in Wisconsin....even if Walker was running for President alone, he would still come in second!</comment>

<comment>@mortyI just sprayed my coffee all over my iPad </comment>

<comment>Walker's problem is there's never room for more than 3 people in the race in terms of media attention.Right now Trump and Jeb are taking the #1 and #2 slots. Slot number 3 is being contested by all the rest. Carson / Fiorina / Kasich are contesting the last ticket with Walker.I think Walker is done until and unless some of the others clear out. He has to be able to get 1 of the 3 media tickets or nobody cares about him or his Harley.</comment>

<comment>Walker's issues go far deeper than merely the number of people in a race.</comment>

<comment>Do you mean psychological issues?</comment>

<comment>No one who has political experience on the GOP side is getting any votes at the moment. The top 3 are Trump, Carson, and Fiorina, with Trump and Carson winning by a wide margin.If voters decide they want an experienced politician when primaries actually begin, Walker will become relevant quickly. He and Rubio are the two who are poised to win this thing if the base decides it wants a serious candidate.But it may be that they don't get the shot. This may be all about Trump and Carson.</comment>

<comment>I don't know about Rubio,  but I know that Walker's corrupt and incompetent.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz has raised a lot of money, and is probably in the best position to inherit Trumps support if it leaves Trump for any reason.</comment>

<comment>"Experienced" politician?...Walker is experienced in is deception....doesn't tell the voters what "surprises" he has for them or that he plans to reverse himself until after he wins an election....experienced in bullying because he has an extremely right wing legislature to sign off on his gambits into taking away rights....experienced in plugging into the Koch donor machine, and we all know how much the Kochs have the rest of the country's interests at heart.....I really don't know how Walker is experienced in truly leading a large, diverse country such as ours....he starts trying to take more rights, he is going to be in court so fast he won't be able to see straight....</comment>

<comment>Walker should be in prison for corruption not in the White House.</comment>

<comment>Right...</comment>

<comment>Anyone that takes money from the Koch Brothers is a criminal.  And I'm even including the otherwise good people at the American Museum of Natural History in New York and PBS in that.</comment>

<comment>Really, you are you over the top.</comment>

<comment>That's funny you don't think the DEMOs don't have deep-pocketed donors.. Just everyone giving $20 at a time :)</comment>

<comment>That's an interesting point.  I would be interested to know which donors from the Democratic side have had lobbyists organizations write Wisconsin legislation as ALEC did.</comment>

<comment>We don't do that in WI.</comment>

<comment>Complete and utter BULL$HIT! I'm barely living through Walker's Koch addiction!</comment>

<comment>I'll have a guess.....ah zero?</comment>

<comment>Actually, Riley, he should be in prison for giving Wisconsin tax payers' dollars to corporate donors with which they kicked back the maximum amount allowed for his endless campaigning.One of those bozos, Bill Minehan, actually got Walker's WEEDIC to pay off his Maserati.</comment>

<comment>Then the Democrats that preceded him should be doing more time than him.  Not only did they use Wisconsin taxpayers' dollars to curry favor with the public employee unions, their tax rates were higher than Walker's (thus, they should do more time).</comment>

<comment>Paying public employees for doing their jobs is corrupt? Dang, you Baggers are greedy.</comment>

<comment>Yes, paying them more than their market value to obtain their votes is corrupt.</comment>

<comment>so, what market are you in, drop out?</comment>

<comment>Who paid them more than their "market share"?Never mind, you hate America. Just crawl back under your slimy rock.</comment>

<comment>There are firefighters in Miami making over $300,000/yr.  The market does not justify that as thousands of qualified people would take the job for $25K.  Regarding your second point, I don't hate America but I do hate liberals like you who resort to insults when they are unable to intelligently debate.  Have a nice day, I am finished with you.</comment>

<comment>The average salary for a Miami firefighter is $46,000. There is a total of one (1) Fire Captain making over $300K and there is outrage about his salary as well as several other government executive salaries in Miami that seem way out of whack. And there should be.Those at the top are grabbing all they can get with both fists. It is up to average people, both liberal and conservative, to join together and force changes in government that benefit the middle class and not just those at the top.Just today, people in Congress, who voted themselves 36 weeks of paid leave every single year, voted down six weeks of one time paid parental leave for average workers.</comment>

<comment>$46,000 is the starting salary, the average is $65,500 which, quite frankly, is still lower than I expected.  Of course, this does not include overtime and retiring after 20 years at 80% of your pay for life. This is also below where it was after the financial crisis when the taxpayers revolted after finding out about it.  Below is from nbcmiami.com in late 2009:***In fact, the majority of the 97 city employees who make more than $200,000 per year are fire rescue employees, mostly supervisors. It is no wonder more than 1,500 people braved February’s chilly temperatures to apply for this lucrative job.Fire-rescue employees also make up the bulk of those who make more than $100,00 per year with a total of 656 employees making that much.***</comment>

<comment>While you're at it brussel - DROP DEAD.</comment>

<comment>(1) Your figures are skewed, average pay is WAY lower than that. (2) Miami isn't in Wisconsin. Double fail.  People who actually know what they're doing have already studied this. WI public employees are paid at or below market value.  Peddle your crazy at the Tea Party rally. We're not buying it.</comment>

<comment>You may not be buying it but you are trying to put words in my mouth as I never said that was the average.  Regarding Wisconsin, how do you know whether or not they are being paid at market value?  Source?

<comment>What's so special about Koch money and opposed to other super-rich players?</comment>

<comment>One of the special things about Koch money is that it's attached to ALEC.  ALEC ends up writing the legislation templates.But this type of power corrupts regardless of party affiliation.</comment>

<comment>I think it is because they are perpetuating a false narrative.  They seem to be trying to fleece the folks that shout their message the loudest.  Their interest is to make more and more money and are quite happy for the middle class to become a casualty in their quest.  They are not proponents of democracy, but an oligarchy.</comment>

<comment>George Soros is an international criminal, with multiple convictions and multiple indictments, in multiple jurisdicitons.  That would be Mr. Dirty Money.</comment>

<comment>His involvement in illegal dark money and Super PAC financing is what he should be jailed for, but, fortunately for Scotty, the Kochs bought him a state court with the same Super PAC money that Walker was being investigated over. I know, I know, logic dictates that those "justices" should have recused themselves due to the common link, but conservatives care nothing about logic these days.</comment>

<comment>Please provide an example of this corruption that you reference as fact.</comment>

<comment>I could, but won't bother. The liberals already know about the Koch Bros. currency manipulation criminal charges, all over Europe.  So do the repubs.

<comment>You mean MI, MN and Lake Superior aren't enough?</comment>

<comment>You comment is truly a breath of fresh air.....very clever and spot on.I travel from Washington state to Victoria once a year for a week of vacation....you folks are awesome and have been putting up with arrogant Americans (like Bill Smith2, below) for so long....</comment>

<comment>Thank you, Christine! I love visiting the US, and I want to clarify that I had no intention of dissing Americans or the state of Wisconsin. Also, I have to admit the obvious that I didn't consult a map before commenting!</comment>

<comment>You know what? Don't waste time paying attention to the negative comments on this blog to your reply....We have a serious attitude problem in the US towards anyone who does not live in our immediate neighborhood...I thought you comment was succinct, to the point and funny., not one was that was "dissing". We know you don't have anything against the citizens of Wisconsin...they just made a mistake with Scott Walker..., anyway Scottie was the one who started this "build a wall on our northern border" idea anyway.....One of the reasons I responded the way I did is that I grew up overseas.....and it is a relief to get out of America once in a while, I cannot abide the xenophobia.....and the accompanying arrogance especially on these blogs...all that talk about submarines in Lake Superior....these are little boys playing battleship.</comment>

<comment>I just replied, and now I don't see my reply.....in essence: your reaction is completely understandable....Many Americans, especially a number on this blog have no appreciation of the fact that Canadians finally get fed up with our negativity towards them....the northern wall deal was Scottie's idea (we like to call him that because of all the respect he has lost with his antics and his hard core right wing tactics)....you just turned it on its head..... Many Americans, especially these days, are fraught with xenophobia, these feelings are fanned by the politicians....to the point where many Americans feel put upon, antagonistic, and out and out hostile. Before you know it they are talking about submarines in Lake Superior....(that is little boys playing battleship)..and would never apologize  for  what are in fact seriously hostile comments on their part...the new right wing motto: "never compromise, never apologize"I have some distance with all this as I grew up overseas....and on one my family's trips back for a year we lived in Montreal while my father went to McGill University....so I have a perspective that would be more rare on this type of blog.</comment>

<comment>None taken GDP. You can disrespect Scooter Walker anytime. It's well deserved. Most Wisconsinites with over a room temp IQ dislike him and his governance.</comment>

<comment>THE BEST POSTING ON THIS THREAD! THANK YOU. FROM A WISCONSINITE. LMAO!</comment>

<comment>Scott Walker is now a little frog in a big pond.</comment>

<comment>Can Hillary save herself, is more like it.. By FAR the candidate in the deepest doo doo..</comment>

<comment>That isn't how you spell Rick Perry.</comment>

<comment>Rick Perry was the already crowned nominee 2 years straight?!?! I did realize that.. </comment>

<comment>Candidate =/= Nominee.</comment>

<comment>Thanks Captain Obvious..</comment>

<comment>Hillary is crashing faster than a led zeppelin</comment>

<comment>Reading is hard. We understand your problem with  that. But please, do try to keep up, this is not about Hillary Clinton.</comment>

<comment>The post I replied to was about Hillary Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Are you a naturally born idiot, or do you have to work at it?</comment>

<comment>What do you say that?</comment>

<comment>We aren't voting for Hilary either. We are done with Bushes and Clintons!Feel the Bern!</comment>

<comment>The rest of us see what Walker did to Wisconsin and we will not be voting for that for the entire country. We have more sense than that.</comment>

<comment>I take it you are referring to turning budget deficits into a budget surpluses with a significant reserve and excellent credit rating.  Yes, we the electorate have far too much sense to want that.</comment>

<comment>if you really believe there is a WI budget surplus, you don't live in Wisconsin.</comment>

<comment>How rude of you to suggest that Wisconsin residents are not capable of simple research.  Even Politifact rated Walker's claim as to the size of the surplus "Mostly True".</comment>

<comment>It also proved that the majority of Walker's statements are false or Pants on Fire. The surplus is due to his borrowing...it's all smoke and mirrors, and if you don't think he'd throw you under the bus if it made him look good, you haven't been paying attention.</comment>

<comment>OK.  Below is my link to the "Mostly True" analysis.  Please send me your links to the "Pants on Fire" or "false" analysis.  I fully expect you to be unable to do so and try to change the subject or resort to a personal insult (standard Liberal playbook).</comment>

<comment>Sorry, it was omitted from the last post for some reason:  http://www.politifact.com/wisc...</comment>

<comment>"Sorry, it was omitted from the last post for some reason:"Because you're an idiot. Trolls like you can't be reasoned with.Calling you bad words, is all you're worth. Ignoramus.</comment>

<comment>This isn't the exact article I was looking for - but it's a good start; it compares the leading liars of Politics - guess who leads the Country in Lies and Burnt Pants...?!https://www.uppitywis.org/blog...</comment>

<comment>First of all, Politifact is non-partisan whereas this is a self described Wisconsin progressive organization.  Second, even if you take what they said as gospel, it is off the point.  I never said Walker was a paragon on truth telling, I said he was telling the truth specifically about the surplus and, according to non-partisan Politifact, he is.</comment>

<comment>I think you are missing the forest for the trees.....to those of us outside of Wisconsin (and many in WI) Walker has shown his true character already....he is not above hurting people, taking away rights, being deceptive by reversing his positions (or "taking back" what he previously said or repackaging it after he gets reelected.....he has lost trust......At the center of all this is the issue of character, he is an opportunist and believes he has the right to cram fascist type ideas/actions (cloaked in right wing Republican rhetoric.....I listened to his entire speech the day he announced for President....) down the country's throat....What I hear and see is echoes of Germany in the 1930s....Goldwater's speech to the convention, although Walker is not as flamboyant as Goldwater...Americans are particularly averse to someone who would take away liberties in the defense of "liberty"....that is what voter suppression is....and all his other moves.</comment>

<comment>I have a visceral dislike for public employee unions and you come across as a statist.  We are never going to agree so there is no point in continuing this discussion.</comment>

<comment>I don't care whether you dislike public employees or not, maybe every  government entity that you use should be unavailable to you for a year or so, and see how you like it...no post office, no transportation workers widening your highways or filling in the potholes, no air traffic controllers, no police, no firefighters, no teachers for your kids or grandkids no homeland security, no CIA or FBI....and finally no Congress to ram through your right wing legislative agenda....I'm sure if I gave it more thought I could think of 5 or 10 other government services that you would do without.....We could just go back to miltias, dirt roads, and have every child be home schooled whether their parent knew the first thing about teaching or not. Anyway without air traffic controllers, the federal aviation agency,  and our seaport system, private industry would be dead in the water.I do not know what a statist is....but you seem to throw that out as a pejorative....I really don't care if we agree or not, and I think  you are right we would never agree, but this a country that prides itself in the First Amendment....and I can respond on what is an open forum....you don't have to read my response....but others will.</comment>

<comment>I don't see how this is a personal insult....poster "Pat" is simply observing what Walker has been doing in his state the whole time he has been Governor....he has thrown many under the bus when he saw it as to his advantage....Those of us who are far away from Wisconsin, but have taken the time to listen to his speeches, and follow his "moves" can see his self aggrandizement motivations including that he thinks nothing of taking away rights, I'm afraid that you are wasting you time trying to defend someone who has already shown his true character ...."you can fool some of the people.....etc" as the saying goes.</comment>

<comment>If the right to fleece the taxpayers was indeed a right, the public employee unions would be at the SCOTUS.  Many people like Scott Walker for the same reason that many people dislike him.  It is as simple as that.</comment>

<comment>Crawl back under your bridge, you F'in troll.</comment>

<comment>The size of the surplus is "mostly true"....are we now into evaluating sizes ...mostly...partly, but headed to mostly.....was terrible, now is headed upward......We, who are not in Wisconsin, are not forming an opinion based on what the residents in Wisconsin think (favorable or non)...Have you every heard of the Stockholm syndrome?</comment>

<comment>If you actually read the Politifact review you would know they only rated Walker's claim "mostly" true because the legislature, at that time, had not actually passed his proposed budget.  That was their ONLY qualifier and the legislature did, in fact, pass it.  Of course it is clear that you have no interest in any fact that might contradict your negative view of Governor Walker.</comment>

<comment>You know, I am a broad minded person and form my opinion after I have made sustained observations of behavior/speeches etc. Scott Walker has given many people, a significant portion of which live in his state a chance to his devious, opportunistic behavior and  his readiness to take away rights......this evaluation is not based on one move or speech.....this is a pattern....In the end whatever Wisconsin citizens thought when they were electing him, he has not risen to the level of someone who can be trusted to take over the power of running the country, he would always be in someone's pocket....would justify taking away voting rights and a host of other curtailments on freedoms that his cronies (other right wingers in Congress)......would feel would be justified ....and in the end those moves would be fascist in nature and would unnecessarily tie up the Supreme Court or would otherwise create a Constitutional crisis....No, we need to find someone else to do this job.</comment>

<comment>As a resident of WI, let me say you're a God damned moron. WI BORROWED money -$800,000,000 to fit the roads.You are seriously/willfully ignorant.</comment>

<comment>If WI is so bad, move to Socialist Illinois and pay the massive taxes that still won't save them from insolvency!  Their credit rating is so bad their borrowing costs alone ensure they can never get out of their hole unless Congress passes a law allowing states to file Chapter 9 (highly unlikely).</comment>

<comment>The guy is a fascist, is really big on taking away rights.....his budget surpluses are bogus because it is done with shifting money around (cutting salaries of public employees is not economic growth producing new revenue....)....he succumbs to handing out state money largesse to whoever he wants to irregardless as to whether it makes economic sense.....No thanks, we do not need this on a national scale.</comment>

<comment>Maybe it's just me, but it never quite looks like anyone's home up there when I see pics of him.</comment>

<comment>All that's missing is a helmet and the short bus.</comment>

<comment>Jonnie? That is a very old, stupid and biased comment!</comment>

<comment>Very spooky eyes. They almost look dead.</comment>

<comment>Whether you like him or not, kudos to The Donald for rightfully pointing out what an incredible poor job Walker has done as Governor, which put a spotlight on Scotty that he wasn't even close to being prepared for. Sane people were already aware of how much short and long term economic damage was being inflicted on Wisconsin due to Walker's mindless passing of any and every piece of legislation he was ordered to by the Kochs and ALEC. With a state legislature and higher court bought and paid for by this corporate owners, all Scotty needed to be able to do was hold a pen, and that's pretty much all he's good for these days.</comment>

<comment>Walker also is trying to destroy one of his state's biggest economic assets: its university system.  Smart governors work hand-in-hand with higher education to develop an educated state workforce and promote business development through university research spin-offs and partnerships with companies that bring in good jobs.   Shifting $250 million from higher education to one of his cronies for yet another useless sports facility is just the icing on the cupcake.</comment>

<comment>With interest, Scotty has ponied up $400-$450 million in taxpayer money for a new NBA arena that won't, despite his foolish claims, be paid for with tax revenue from visiting NBA teams. the whole thing is just Walker's way of repaying one of the owners for donating to his asinine candidacy.</comment>

<comment>You are obviously completely uninformed as the team owner is one of Hillary Clinton's largest donors.</comment>

<comment>So the guy is covering his bases. Clinton won't get the nomination either.</comment>

<comment>Shut up FOOL.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for a very grounded comment.</comment>

<comment>Politifact already rated Trump's comment about Walker's budget as false.  Find a new talking point.  The only economic "damage" he did was to the entitled parasite public employee unions.  He inherited a budget deficit which he quickly turned into a surplus.</comment>

<comment>Trump was more correct than wrong. Just from Politifact's explanation, this is a matter of semantics and Wisconsin went from a projected surplus to a projected deficit. http://www.politifact.com/wisc...</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate teachers?  Or is it education you are opposed to?</comment>

<comment>I don't hate teachers, I hate the teacher's unions who will defend the indefensible.  Think about it, how many of them EVER get fired?  You can't make be believe that 99.99% of the personnel in any industry are doing an acceptable job.  They could care less if children are being taught by a lazy, rude or incompetent teacher.  All they care about is protecting said teacher's job.</comment>

<comment>My wife is a teacher and in fact teachers get fired all the time.  This is a well propagated myth that you have bought into and allow this myth to be used to hurt all teachers and not just the few who are "bad" teachers.What you also fail to see is that this Conservative battle with unions is not to benefit taxpayers but solely to degrade organized labor's ability to fight for the rights of American Workers, unionized or not.  By supporting Walker's union fight, you are fighting against workers for the benefit of the 1% and you should be ashamed of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Although I will stipulate that not all localities operate exactly the same way, I would still be hard pressed to find another profession where so few are fired for lack of performance.  Those fired for things like sexual misconduct obviously don't count.</comment>

<comment>No, there were fired because they were lousy teachers. How much is Walker paying you to lie?</comment>

<comment>Zero.  Please see previous post and please prove I am lying by demonstrating that another profession has a lower fire rate.</comment>

<comment>You know you're a God damned liar. When did you stop beating your wife?</comment>

<comment>Thank you for proving my point.  None of your responses contained any substance, only personal attacks.  You are obviously incapable of an honest debate so I am done trying.</comment>

<comment>You started it.</comment>

<comment>You don't/can't count/matter either.</comment>

<comment>I support the Trade Union right to collective bargaining, but NOT the public service unions.  There is a countervailing party in the former, but not the latter.  So no 'greedy owner' to fight and make a deal.  Just other public employees agreeing to take more from the state treasury.   Some teachers are underpaid, while a high percentage are actually overrated and overpaid, IMHPO.Ronald Reagan, former head of the SAG, had a similar opinion, of public service unions, and proved it to the Air Traffic Controllers.  </comment>

<comment>Yes, Reagan was the original union buster of our age....but he didn't limit himself to that action....he went on to disparage anyone who worked for a public/government entity no matter what job they were doing, how well they were doing it, what agency they worked for.....his attitude permeates the right wing these days....teachers have gotten the brunt of it....Americans do not like acknowledging that they often fail in their home discipline of their children...they expect the teachers to control their children who are out of control...the classes in most public schools are overcrowded........I would challenge anyone to step in under those conditions for a whole school year and do better.</comment>

<comment>While education may have needed to make some sacrifices for the Wisconsin budget, Walker's approach did nothing to help Wisconsin.That said, it certainly helped his presidential bid which is what it was all about to begin with.</comment>

<comment>Walker has done a LOT to put Wisconsin on sound financial footing.  Just look to the south (Illinois) to see the opposite.  Illinois is literally bankrupt despite massive tax increases (as opposed to cuts in Wisconsin) a couple of years ago.  This is what happens when you have decades of Democrat government.  Their credit rating is the worst in the country and justifiably so.  Just as I enjoy watching the Socialists in Greece beg for money, watching the Socialists in Illinois do so will be even more fun because no one is going to give them enough.</comment>

<comment>Well, no he hasn't.  You could also compare him to MN - which is a more similar state, he doesn't fare so well.But really, what Walker has done is damage Wisconsin in a much longer-term way.  He's damage the schools and been very divisive by refusing to negotiate or work with education to find solutions.Your pleasures in failures doesn't make you, or their opposites a success.</comment>

<comment>MN has higher taxes than WI as well, they just are more competent than IL which is not saying much.</comment>

<comment>Their economy is growing.  They don't have the divisive politics and their education system is not losing expertise.Wisconsin, without major cities has worked to compete with Chicago and the Twin Cities.  Madison was always our best bet, but Walker - by killing rail, attacking the University, and using divisive politics for his own political purposes has damaged Wisconsin's opportunities.Funding the Milwaukee Bucks isn't going to help us be competitive.</comment>

<comment>Funding the Bucks is proof that he is acting in the best interests of Wisconsin as their principal owner is one of Hillary Clinton's biggest donors and fundraisers.  He did something that was going to hurt him politically in the GOP primary, and help Hillary, because he felt it was the right thing to do.  Whether you agree or disagree with helping the Bucks, this showed character.  With respect to rail, I personally like it but it is a HUGE money loser that has to be subsidized by the taxpayers.  We have already discussed the education issue.</comment>

<comment>You and I have very different definitions of character.</comment>

<comment>How else would you describe doing something that he thought would benefit Wisconsin while also benefitting his chief Democrat rival and causing himself problems with the GOP base?</comment>

<comment>More blather from the Low IQ imbecile.</comment>

<comment>Shut up you know nothing shlt heel.</comment>

<comment>The US ranks far higher in education spending than we do in educational achievement.  Throwing money at it is obviously not working as it just goes to academic bureaucrats.</comment>

<comment>Throwing money at it doesn't fix it, but neither does attacking it an blaming it for the state's problems.  So instead of trying to mitigate the damage done to the university system, he took pride in damaging it and now talent is leaving and recruiting is more difficult.  We already had enough challenges in retaining talent.Throwing money at the Milwaukee Bucks is obviously not working either - but there it is.</comment>

<comment>Exactly</comment>

<comment>I've been working in schools for a long time. I saw two really poor teachers out of hundreds. Both of them were fired.</comment>

<comment>I only went to high school for 4 years and had more than two teachers who were incompetent (and not fired).  Heck, one was absent nearly 40% of the time to go on business trips with her husband who was a successful businessman.  This was a major deal because she was a Spanish teacher and the substitutes generally spoke no Spanish!  As I said, I am sure it differs among different districts.</comment>

<comment>Judging from your posts, I'd guess you dropped out of high school after 6 years.</comment>

<comment>Most people go to high school for 4 years, what do you mean by "only"....so one of your teachers was married to a businessman who obviously encouraged her to skip days on her job?.....and somehow this is representative of all teachers??????!!</comment>

<comment>So you were home schooled?</comment>

<comment>The termination rates of tenured public school teachers for incompetence (2.5%) is actually higher than that in the private sector (1.3%), according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and a study of teacher incompetence by the Center for American Progress (Not exactly a pro-union organization).Facts really suck when you're a teabagger.</comment>

<comment>Still laughing!  You citing the Center for American Progress would be like me citing the Heritage Foundation.  Of course they are a pro-union organization as they are admittedly a left wing organization.  I'm not positive but I think John Podesta might have even founded it.  I know he ran it for a while.</comment>

<comment>(1) When did I say they weren't progressive?  I said they are not exactly a pro union organization.  Read some of their papers on teachers unions.  They are definitely not pro teachers' union.  (2) The report I read actually was quoting US Dept. of Ed. statistics, so even if CAP was biased, it's not their data.  (3) The private-sector rate is now down to 1.1% and it includes layoffs as well as firings.  Argue the data, if you can, but don't throw labels around as if they are an actual argument.</comment>

<comment>Please clarify.  In your original post you referenced firings for incompetence but just now indicated the private sector rate includes layoffs as well.  Do the figures from the original post include layoffs as well?</comment>

<comment>Private sector, yes. Public sector, no.</comment>

<comment>Then I would have to read the entire report.  I am not saying you are wrong but this makes no sense to me.  I can't fathom that more than 1 out of every 50 people public school teachers are fired for incompetence.  There was never a teacher fired when I went to school and the same is true for my kids.  That alone has to be a sample of several hundred teachers.  I am still in contact with one of my teachers who retired after 30 years and he said he never saw one fired for incompetence.  My suspicion is that the public number also includes layoffs but, perhaps, the school system I am most familiar with is simply a corrupt pawn of the union more so than the rest of the country.</comment>

<comment>So let me rephrase your response, to be sure I'm clear."I'm fully invested in my prior notions about teachers and if you present data to the contrary, I'm inclined not to believe it."</comment>

<comment>Lol.  Yes, but not for the reason that you think.  I don't believe that more than 1 in 50 public school teachers are incompetent.  I really would like access to the entire report.</comment>

<comment>Go to the Center for American Progress and search around.  The data came from a paper copy of a PDF I got from there.  Sorry I don't have a link.</comment>

<comment>Liar, moron.</comment>

<comment>The "surplus" was created on paper by borrowing and passing the costs on to the next generation!</comment>

<comment>Nice try but that does not create a surplus on paper even if he did it.  Accounting 101.</comment>

<comment>What is this with Politifact? ......are they somehow the oracle of truth? and why do you need to be such an ardent defender of Walker, did you contribute to his campaign and now see him sliding in the polls? I could see why what some of us are saying would irritate you.</comment>

<comment>Cheesehead here, ummmm Walker has never dominated Wisconsin. Tommy Thompson dominated Wisconsin politics. Tommy would still be governor and Wisconsin would be in a much better place if not for W luring him away. Walker ran in an open race as just a Republican and barely beat just another Democrat in a Republican election year (2010), in a bad economy, that saw an incumbent Senator Feingold lose to "Our Dumb Senator" Ron Johnson. After the election Walker changed his stripes. This resulted in a recall. He survived it in large part because the Democrats ran the same Milwaukee Democrat that lost the first time which did nothing to discourage the sore loser aspect. In 2014 Walker had spent two years moving towards the center, against his party, and as the incumbent he beat a first time candidate that was far from inspiring in her campaign.If Wisconsin held its gubernatorial elections the same year as its Presidential ones Walker would still be a Milwaukee county executive.To answer why has Scott Walker lost himself:1. He is not a Republican who has won a blue state like Tommy Thompson or Arne Carlson. He won tight races in off year elections against poor opposition. To think he could win Wisconsin (or MN or MI) as a presidential candidate against a real opponent is wishful dreaming.2. He went two (and a half) campaigns claiming he dropped out of college for a business opportunity. His opportunity was an administrative job with the local Red Cross. Not exactly a Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg kinda opportunity. No way this would have worked in a general election in the 21st century. In the primaries maybe, but the general electorate does value education enough in its President that a high school diploma and some college wouldn't cut it.3. As pointed out in the article after his recall scare he went left of his own party before they pulled a Kansas. Unlike Kansas, and its lack of an organized Democratic opposition, someone figured out that if allowed to go there the Republicans would doom themselves in Wisco. While this may actually argue for a Presidential run, it does not play well in the primaries.4. He's a good minor league player who finds a way to win. But in his gubernatorial races he showed serious weaknesses as regards to being unscripted and speaking well on subjects he should have known. He's Sarah Palin without the charisma. It was only a matter of time before this became apparent.</comment>

<comment>Walker actually spent two years moving towards the extremist right of the GOP, not to the middle. He was recalled due to the Koch and ALEC brother written policies inflicting so much damage on Wisconsin.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and then after the recall he moved back the other way. I'm not saying he made it all the way to the middle, but he did move to the left of the very right-wing Republicans in the legislature.</comment>

<comment>Are you insane?!!!!!</comment>

<comment>He pretended to move to the middle, only to be palatable to voters in time for then next election.....after which the gloves were off, and he was back to his usual m.o. and now he wants to do away with freedom of information about his dealings in Wisconsin.</comment>

<comment>That must be why there is talk that he won't seek a third term as Governor.</comment>

<comment>I am an undecided Texas Republican; and vote a split ticket.Is candidate Scott Walker committed to his oath of office, and more particularly: the constitutional rule of law, Secure borders and ports, National Sovereignty, Immigration enforcement (mass deportation), balanced budgets, and bringing crooked politicians to justice?Will his future DOJ prosecute: Bush and Obama as well as their henchmen, for their crimes?Walker is apparently Article II eligible, which is more than we can say for Obama, Cruz, Rubio and Jindal.  So I could vote for him in the Texas Republican Primary.</comment>

<comment>Interesting mixture of reality, fantasy, and false paranoia in your post. Interesting.</comment>

<comment>Eclectic and nonspecific comment.  Not interesting.Bulverisms are ironically indicative of mental disorders.</comment>

<comment>Reality: Walker is the Governor of WisconsinFantasy: Expecting Walker to enforce any laws or to actually try to prosecute Bush and Obama for crimes you failed to specifyFalse paranoia: Claiming that Obama wasn't Article 2 eligible</comment>

<comment>Reality: Scott Walker is the sitting governor of Wisconsin.Reality: George Bush and Barack Obama refused to enforce federal immigration law; and can be placed in criminal jeopardy for that violation of law.  Aiding and Abetting an Illegal Alien is a criminal act.Reality: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are 'Birthers'.Perhaps candidate Scott Walker will share his considered judgement on these (immigration & Article II) critical constitutional crises.</comment>

<comment>Billy, take your pill.Obama and Bush funded and saw to it that those who entered the country without permission were deported. Their job is to enforce the laws when and as they can. It is not to prevent people from breaking the law. They are in no danger of ever being charged for any illegal immigrant.Clinton is not a birther. Trump is. That is neither illegal nor immoral. It is stupid on Trump's part, but the only ones who embrace the Birther movement are already on Team Trump.</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton is Birther-1 and attempted to have Obama removed from the Democratic Party Presidential Primary ballot in 2008 and subsequently in the General Election, and thereafter.</comment>

<comment>Nope. You either knew that and are pretending to be stupid or really are that stupid.</comment>

<comment>The HRC Campaign openly requested assistance in filing administrative hearing requests in all 50 states.I filed one of those requests for Administrative Review of Barack Obama Article II qualifications, with the Texas Secretary of State.  It was posted on the HRC campaign blogs, due to an added paragraph related to ELECTORS.</comment>

<comment>I think he's just stupid.</comment>

<comment>In a pig's eye.Obama & W openly refused to enforce federal immigration law.</comment>

<comment>George Bush and Barack Obama refused to enforce federal immigration law; and can be placed in criminal jeopardy for that violation of law.  Aiding and Abetting an Illegal Alien is a criminal act.But that is not reality.  Reality was that the Congress refused to authorize the spending necessary to fully enforce the law.  It has refused to do that since 1987.Obviously then, the executive branch's leader is constrained to do something less than fully enforce the law because the Congress has decided that is the way it wants the law enforced.</comment>

<comment>Trust me. Walker is incompetent and corrupt. I could write a book backing up that statement.</comment>

<comment>Go right ahead, feel free to believe that this guy will fulfill your every political dream....as for crooked politicians....see a lot of those in the right wing...selling their political soul along with America's treasure to the highest bidder.</comment>

<comment>Scott Walker bought into his own hype. The media regularly touted him as a major Presidential contender because he took on the unions, won a recall election, and was the favorite son of the Koch brothers. Jeb Bush has fallen into the same trap, believing the media who said Bush would be unbeatable because of his money advantage. Both candidates assumed they'd be able to coast to the nomination and both learned the hard way that debates really do count. At the first debate, they both performed poorly. You're no longer a winner just because you stood there and didn't make any gaffes. As the article correctly pointed out, Walker has never bothered to learn about national issues. I'd love to see him answer the question Hugh Hewitt posed for Donald Trump. I bet he'd fail too.I'm glad Walker said he'd build a wall along the Canadian border not because I think we need one, but because he unintentionally revealed a truth about the Republican party. They claim they want a wall to keep people from entering the country illegally and to prevent terrorists from sneaking in. Well if that's true, then they should be in favor of one along the Canadian border. The fact that only want one along the southern border shows what this whole immigration debate is really about. The Republican party is a bunch of angry white men desperate to stop the 'brownification' of their country. Thank you Scott Walker for making that obvious.</comment>

<comment>The media has failed to point out that Walker has never won a Governor election held when a Presidential election is as well, when voter turnout is far higher, nor have they pointed out that Walker "taking on" the unions was only possible because the Kochs had bought him a conservative-controlled state legislature, just as they did for Brownback in Kansas.</comment>

<comment>What you described would take up too many lines. The media needs to be able to summarize a candidate in fewer sentences. One would be ideal.</comment>

<comment>You could say the same thing about Jeb!, Rubio, Perry, Christie, Huckabee, and Kasich, too. Only Santorum, IIRC, has won a statewide election in a Presidential year, 2000, and he lost his reelection bid in 2006 badly. And Lindsey Graham, but he's getting nowhere. </comment>

<comment>I'd love to see him answer the question Hugh Hewitt posed for Donald Trump. I bet he'd fail too.Yes. And I expect every candidate except probably Hillary Clinton to screw it up as well. And the truth is no one cares except the interviewer. No one cares who the Defense Minister in Iran is except for the Iranian Defense Minister's family.Americans want to know how their lives are effected in the short term. Only after the election does foreign policy mean anything.</comment>

<comment>So you don't think Americans care if their President doesn't even know who the leaders of Hezbollah, al-Qaeda, al-Nusra, and Isis are? We're not talking about obscure players in another country. We're talking about leaders of terrorist organizations. These were not gotcha questions.</comment>

<comment>They didn't care that Bush didn't know the difference between Shia and Sunni and why that might be important.So I don't think Mr Fusion is saying it's actually not important; I think he's saying there isn't a history of it being important to the electorate.  Which I think is a fair observation about FP in general.</comment>

<comment>First of all, Bush was already President, not a candidate running for the nomination. Second, Republican voters don't care about the different types of Muslims. In their minds, they're all the same, hence the reason they were quick to believe Saddam Hussein was behind 9/11. But this is a contest for the nomination. Republican do care if a candidate for their party is so clueless about terrorist organizations that he doesn't even know who their leaders are.</comment>

<comment>As Tip O"Neal put it, "All politics are local". The only foreign policy people are interested in is what effects them. Ask Americans if they want prices in Walmart to go up because of a tariff on Chinese goods. That is our limit on foreign policy.We care about the Middle East because of Israel and the left overs of the Cold War. We care about Africa because, well, no one knows why. We care about Russia because they are our enemy. We care about Japan and Korea because of where our TVs and phones were made.ISIS to most Americans is just a name. They couldn't tell you were they are. But they could describe Kim Kardashian's butt.</comment>

<comment>You're talking about the American public as a whole who, I agree, are pretty ignorant about foreign affairs. But I'm talking about the people who vote in Republican primaries. These people tend to be more informed, or at least like to think of themselves as more informed. They'll watch Fox Noise and hear the names of groups like ISIS and Hezbollah or the names of their leaders. The average Fox Noise viewer probably wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between ISIS and Al-Qaeda or match the leader to the terrorist organization. But they do expect their President to at least be aware of who they are. Remember, Republicans are the ones who argue that their party does a better job of keeping America safe. It's hard to make that argument if you nominate a person who's the male version of Sarah Palin. Yes, Republican voters take pride in their ignorance. But I think even they expect their candidates to have a minimum level of knowledge.</comment>

<comment>You're talking about the American public as a whole who, I agree, are pretty ignorant about foreign affairs. But I'm talking about the people who vote in Republican primaries.Who are the same ignorant people. They don't know who the General of the Hotsi Totsies are and couldn't care less. All they know is that "Israel = good, Muslim = bad" and anything else is filler on the nightly news.I agree they expect their President to know. On September 11, I held out hope that as (in my opinion) unintelligent as Bush was, at least he had intelligent people in the Pentagon, State Department, and CIA that would do the right thing. Geeze was I naive.Most Americans grew up under America's nuclear umbrella or with America as the sole super-power. They only know America will defeat any aggressor. They actually care little about the how which explains the constant calls to turn the Mid-East into a glass desert. I doubt more than 5% of Americans can tell you how many aircraft carriers we have at the moment but 95% of Americans know that they are the biggest and baddest carriers out there. After that, we get the crickets.</comment>

<comment>Who are the same ignorant people.No, actually they're not. Again, you have to draw a distinction between people who just don't care about the news or politics versus people who do care, but get their information from unreliable sources. The latter are the people who show up at primaries because they've actually been following the campaign. The former won't bother with the primaries and might not even show up for the general election. When polls come out, the media focuses on the numbers. But what they rarely talk about is who are the likely voters. I can be a pollster and call someone today who says he's voting for Trump, but how likely is he to brave the brutal Iowa winters to vote for him? I think as we get closer to actual elections, a lot of these angry Trump supporters are suddenly going to have second thoughts, similar to what happened in 2008 when Republicans asked themselves "Do I really want Sarah Palin to be a heartbeat away from the Presidency?"</comment>

<comment>It's worth noting that Al Gore secured 500,000 more votes than Bush.  We didn't elect the family screw up, the SCOTUS did.</comment>

<comment>No, the strong support Pat Buchanan surprisingly had amongst African-Americans in Palm Beach County decided the election.</comment>

<comment>Oh, it was not the Jewish American Princesses that put him over the top?</comment>

<comment>The entire discussion over chads and voter "intent" was ridiculous.  Actions have consequences.  If you intended on betting on the 4 horse, the 4 wins and then you realize you accidentally punched the 3 on the machine, it is on you.  The Democrats condescendingly act like voters are children.  Sadly, many of their supporters want to be treated like children (especially the part where the parent provides for them).</comment>

<comment>Forgot to take your meds didn't you. Delusional Bastard.</comment>

<comment>Some presidential popular votes, electoral college votes and congressional tie breakers have been interesting.  Beginning with the Election of Thomas Jefferson.</comment>

<comment>Not knowing much about foreign policy won't stop Americans from voting for someone they like.  See: GWB.</comment>

<comment>Trump not knowing who the Quds force in Iran is or Carson not knowing which countries are in NATO didn't stop them from surging in the polls, so there's that.</comment>

<comment>For now. But as we have more debates, I suspect a lot of Republican voters will worry about putting forth a candidate who sounds like Miss Teen South Carolina. I'm sure they'll want a candidate who at least sounds like he or she is versed on foreign policy.</comment>

<comment>As Terri correctly pointed out, you have Palin who does sound like Miss Teen South Carolina and they made her a VP nom. As you can tell through these comments alone, there are lots of GOP voters pride themselves on being intentionally low-info and obtuse and people like Trump, Palin, and etc pander to such types.</comment>

<comment>They made her a VP because they thought having a woman on the ticket would be lure all the Hillary supporters upset about Obama winning the nomination. That strategy failed, partly because Hillary's support wasn't just about gender, but also because of Palin herself. I think conservatives learned their lesson. They don't need a policy wonk, but they can't afford to nominate someone who's completely clueless either. The answer lies between these two extremes.</comment>

<comment>Assumes facts not in evidence, your honor.If conservatives had learned their lesson, Donald freaking Trump wouldn't be the overwhelming leader in every poll taken of Republican primary voters.</comment>

<comment>There's a big difference between Trump and Palin. Trump may not be able to name the leaders of ISIS or Hezbollah, but he doesn't talk like he has diarrhea of the mouth. And unlike Palin, he actually has a record of getting something done. I'm not saying he'd make a good President. But he's a huge improvement over Palin, which says a lot about her.</comment>

<comment>I honestly don't see a substantive difference between Trump and Palin, especially regarding, as you put it, 'diarrhea of the mouth.'  They both spew nonsense. "All of them, Katy" vs. "I'll build a wall and get Mexico to pay for it." "Pallin' around with terrorists" vs. "criminals and rapists."  As to getting something done, she was elected governor of Alaska and quit halfway through her term. He built casinos and drove them into bankruptcy (how in the hell does one bankrupt a casino, ffs?). Yes, he's created a "brand" and has a fuckton of money, but to me, that's not really the same thing as getting something done.</comment>

<comment>YOU may not see a difference between Trump and Palin. But you're not one of those people voting in the Republican primaries, are you? What matters is whether those voters see a difference. Trump may say things we know to be flat out false. But he's basically saying what Republicans already believe to be true. What distinguishes him from Palin, in their minds, is that he's being honest and not scripted whereas Palin is just making up stuff as she goes along.</comment>

<comment>Have you ever read a Trump transcription?    'Rambling' would be a charitable description. </comment>

<comment>He's not eloquent and he wanders from topic to topic. But there's never any question about what he means. With Palin, he really is word salad.</comment>

<comment>In 2000 Gore did show he knew who all the foreign leaders were. He was roundly ridiculed for it too.</comment>

<comment>Lets not even mention how "elitist" and "uppity" they think Kerry and Obama are.</comment>

<comment>Hugh Hewitt posed the same question to Carly Fiorina, who had not heard the Trump interview. She handled it well. All the GOP candidates with FP experience have handled such questions well too.Qassem Suleimani had been head of the Quds Force since 1998, so he's not exactly new on the scene. Certainly the thousands of Americans wounded or killed by the shaped charges Suleimani supplied to Iraqi Shia militias know his name. Even Trump knew his name, but he confused Quds Force with the Kurds. </comment>

<comment>Two months ago neither knew his name. So what is your point Nadine, besides Fiorina brushed up on foreign names?</comment>

<comment>The Koch brothers will have to buy a new sock puppet to run for president.</comment>

<comment>They still own Rafael Cruz, and will own Jeb if he somehow survives his family legacy in buying the GOP nomination.</comment>

<comment>They'll dangle too much money not to get more takers. Even $50 million is too much money to turn your nose up at.</comment>

<comment>Picture caption:  "I dunno, what do you WANT me to say?"</comment>

<comment>Has there EVER been a photo of Walker where a caption that simply reads "Derp" couldn't be applied?</comment>

<comment>nope.</comment>

<comment>As I thought. Photos of Rafael Cruz have a similar quality, except it always looks as though Teddy is whining like a baby.</comment>

<comment>"Picture caption" Damned hemorrhoids. I gotta see that brain surgeon".</comment>

<comment>Does Scott Walker support corporate welfare?  For example, in 2010 Walker supported nuclear power plant construction, and ending the construction moratorium.  Civilian Nuclear Power Electrical Generation Plants are not economically competitive and do not adequately insure for disaster damages.The multiple meltdowns and explosions at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station DEMONSTRATED the design flaws and disaster potential of nuclear power plants, in 2011.  Some politicians may (reasonably) have changed their earlier positions following the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear power station disasters.Does Scott Walker still favor spending taxpayer funds, mandating electrical purchases  and other subsidies for  nuclear power plant construction and operation?http://host.madison.com/news/o...</comment>

<comment>If you've seen Walker's latest "budget", rather than using taxes to fund highway maintenance, as a sane Governor should, Scotty instead BORROWED $850 million in long term loans to pay for the work, which means that, with interest, Scotty has added yet another $1 billion plus in long term debt to the state of Wisconsin, once again punishing those in the state smart enough to vote against him, as well as those residents who foolishly continue to support him.</comment>

<comment>The USA has not passed a budget in years.  So while I do have some general interest in sound fiscal policy, perhaps some BASICS 1st.Wisconsin was a financial disaster area, when Walker took office, if memory serves.Correction: Apparently, according to the LATimes, congress passed a budget this year.</comment>

<comment>And yet it was Democrats who last passed a budget in 2009.</comment>

<comment>According to the ultra right wing Los Angeles Times:  Congress passed a budget in April 2015.http://www.latimes.com/nation/...</comment>

<comment>But, but, you just wrote above:The USA has not passed a budget in years.Now you say they passed a budget in April of this year?</comment>

<comment>Apparently none of us were aware that Congress passed a budget this year.  But the LATimes says they did.So it may require some further review.</comment>

<comment>I'm just wondering how the Federal Government has been able to function all these years without a budget. Although I do know the answer, I'll let you think about it.</comment>

<comment>ILLEGALLY, like everything else the feds do.</comment>

<comment>Illegally? So how did the government pay everyone? You do know that the President can't pay people without Congresses permission. Oh, you don't know? Then why do they need a budget again?</comment>

<comment>Yesterday, Fusion said that COURTS can appropriate their own money, without legislative permission, if memory serves.</comment>

<comment>And they may if the legislature doesn't. But that is too hard a thing for poor Billy to understand. You know, mention the word "Constitution" or "Supreme Court" and Billy starts screaming "illegitimate".So Billy, have you figured out how the President can pay people if there is no budget?</comment>

<comment>Mr. Fusion is apparently a SCOFFLAW; and lacks any consistent position on the constitutional rule of law, or the candor to enable such a consistent position.</comment>

<comment>So no budget for years and Billy can't explain how the government could spend money.</comment>

<comment>Illegally</comment>

<comment>So you don't know.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I do. The federal government routinely violates the law.  And the federal government spends unauthorized funds, which is illegal.</comment>

<comment>How was Wisconsin a financial disaster area when Walker took office?   Please be specific.</comment>

<comment>Do your own research.  Wisconsin was upside down and underwater.  Big structural deficits.</comment>

<comment>If you want to waste your time by convincing nobody of your argument because you won't back it up, then go right ahead. "If memory serves" isn't convincing.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't that require having a memory in the first place?Wisconsin was in good shape until the Bush Recession. Then, like everyone, they were hurt.</comment>

<comment>Let take a look at the Midwest shall we.  WI (Republican governor), MI (Republican governor), IN (Republican governor) and OH (Republican governor) all have good credit ratings and balanced budgets.  IL (Democrat governors until the last election and still a Democratic legislature) has the worst credit rating of any state and massive deficits.  The only other state in the region with major fiscal problems, Kentucky, has, you guessed it, a Democrat governor.  Have you noticed a pattern here?</comment>

<comment>The Indiana infrastructure is falling apart. The government has put off any maintenance and over the next few years the bill will be ten times higher as they will have to rebuild, not just pave the roads. But hey, the millionaires are happy with their tax cuts.</comment>

<comment>Indiana has had balanced budgets for as long as I can remember and I spend a lot of time in Indiana from Indianapolis south and I don't see infrastructure falling apart.  On the contrary, 2 new Ohio River bridges are being built as we speak.</comment>

<comment>"Have you noticed a pattern here?"YES, you're delusional and a LOW IQ Moron.</comment>

<comment>We are ASKING Governor Walker and candidate Walker about his record and future plans.  We are not interested in 'proving' anything to the satisfaction of insatiable TROLLS.</comment>

<comment>Care to provide a cite for that?I live in Illinois and have family in Wisconsin.  Are you sure you're not getting the states mixed up?</comment>

<comment>Illinois is still upside down and underwater.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but we're talking about Wisconsin.Can you provide any evidence, other than assertion, that Wisconsin was a financial disaster area (your claim) when Walker took office?</comment>

<comment>I won't bother. Scott Walker has a campaign to make his case.  I'm not going to do it for him.</comment>

<comment>So that's a no?  You often go around assuming other people will make your argument for you?I can tell you what has happened since Walker has taken office; private sector growth has lagged peer states (even Illinois!), the deficit has ballooned and the middle class has shrunk at almost a nation-leading rate.So yes, it might be a financial disaster zone now. It most definitely wasn't when he was elected.  It even had a pension funding rate that was the envy of the nation.</comment>

<comment>For some reason the Wisconsin voters hired Scott Walker and kept him on. And his supporters and campaign staff have a lot to say on such matters. Perhaps you should visit his webpage, since you are so fascinated by the subject.</comment>

<comment>Which is why none of these Republican Governors want to run again.  Their balanced budgets were all the result of postponing hard choices for the next guy.   They don't want to be the next guy.</comment>

<comment>Walker choosing the taxpayers over the parasitic public employee unions will help the next guy.</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate our Constitution. The Fourth Amendment stipulates that they get paid for their labor.</comment>

<comment>No, Amendment XIII ended slavery and involuntary servitude, except for convicts.How would Amendment IV (search warrants) affect wages at McDonalds? https://www.law.cornell.edu/co... </comment>

<comment>But it does not stipulate that they get paid more than market rate.  Don't be naïve.  Union boss tells politician "give me what I want or we will support your opponent".  A private union does not have to the power to get the person they are negotiating with fired whereas a public union does.  It is not an arms length negotiation.</comment>

<comment>And you have evidence of that? I didn't think so.</comment>

<comment>Eat shlt and die.</comment>

<comment>The interstate system in Milwaukee was in need of repair and expansion. You and the  democrat Mayor can whine all you want about it , but the bottom line is that if a company can not move its goods then they will not build here or will leave for another metro area where they can.</comment>

<comment>The problem is the State didn't spend money on road maintenance so the roads just deteriorated. we have the same problem here in Indiana. The State won't maintain the roads and they are falling apart. Instead of spending $25,000/mile to chip seal a cracked road and get another couple of years out of it, by the middle of winter it will be so full of potholes that drivers will more than that on new suspensions and tire repairs. Next year they will need to spend $1,000,000/mile rebuilding the highway.</comment>

<comment>Scotty immediately turned a budget deficit into a surplus.  Find a legitimate reason to oppose him.</comment>

<comment>You're a lying piece of shlt. Idiot</comment>

<comment>Oh great a anti nuclear nut.</comment>
