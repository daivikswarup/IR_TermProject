<comment>Does the non voter really understand the police issue?</comment>

<comment>Do most voters?</comment>

<comment>Shorter version - the author believes that we need more low motivation/low information voters to influence politics in the direction he and the rest of the left would prefer.  Somehow I don't find this a persuasive argument in favor of the wisdom of his preferred policies.</comment>

<comment>What makes you think people who are politically involved are better informed than people who aren't? Have you seen the chain emails going around, especially on the right? Have you seen Facebook?</comment>

<comment>The author does give one example that non-voters are less informed: they are less aware of differences between the parties.</comment>

<comment>Studies have consistently shown that the more educated one is about economics, the more likely one is to vote Republican.http://www.newyorkfed.org/rese...But, you're right, I don't think it makes one more likely to vote.</comment>

<comment>"Studies?" You badly Google one link from the Fed and that's "studies?" And what does knowing about economics have to do with being high info?</comment>

<comment>Lots of people think they're educated about economics. Karl Marx, for example, has an entire theory about economics.</comment>

<comment>A physicist, a chemist, and an economist are stranded on a desert island without food or supplies. A can of beans washes up on the beach.The physicist suggests that they improvise a machine to bash a hole in the can.The chemist suggests that they find a combination of substances that will weaken the metal.The economist says, "assume a can opener..."</comment>

<comment>A can of beans that floats is likely damaged, probably with botulism.  :-)</comment>

<comment>Solved their problem.</comment>

<comment>Ah, economics. Where I'll tell you tomorrow why the things I predicted yesterday did not happen today.</comment>

<comment>Are you seriously trying to make the case that an uninformed consumer will make a better choice than one who attempts to keep abreast of things?  That wouldn't be true if we were talking about buying a car, computer, or food, but apparently politics is exempt from the same dynamic?No offense, but your citation of Facebook and chain emails isn't a particularly convincing basis for the virtues of a larger and low information electorate, and I think you know better.</comment>

<comment>Being the civically responsible lady/gentleman I'm sure you are, I'm sure when you think of "informed" or "politically engaged" voters who, much like yourself, read all the papers, stroke your beard (if you're a gentleman), think deeply about the respective merits of each argument and reach a reasonable conclusion.It doesn't work that way. The "Tea Party" is arguably the most energized, organized and passionate force in politics today. More than 50 percent of them routinely report that they believe President Obama was born in Kenya, for one. They love passing this stuff around. They pay to subscribe to Glen Beck's channel. This is their bread and butter. Hell, if you took a drag on your flask for every time somebody cited a Breitbart site or The Daily Caller in the Atlantic comments you'd be fired by 10 a.m.I implied earlier that people who are more politically engaged are more likely to believe misinformation and conspiracy theories. Lo and behold, this comment section filled up with misinformation and conspiracy theories.If it makes you feel better, it's not just the right. In 2004 I *knew* Bush was running a FEMA camp in Marseilles, Illinois (yeah, that one didn't start with the Tea Party), Osama bin Laden had been dead for years and Diebold had a secret plan to program its voting machines to steal the election for Bush.</comment>

<comment>Have you seen the dumb false memes from the left on Facebook?  I'm amazed at the dumb stuff the left believes.</comment>

<comment>Well, this is a democracy which implies that uneducated have the right to and should vote.</comment>

<comment>I would love for someone who thinks people are too dumb to have their voices heard to actually come up with a standard by which everyone should be measured in order to be granted suffrage.  Civics test?  Math test?  Literature test?  How many of your manually-skilled immigrant forebearers would be denied suffrage?  How many veterans?  It is beyond ludicrous that someone coming back from shedding blood for the US could come home and be denied the vote on the basis of some arbitrary scantron test.</comment>

<comment>The author really lost all credibility with this humdinger..."But if so, America is moving in the wrong direction. In the wake of a recent Supreme Court case restricting the Voting Rights Act, states have begun to pass an increasing number of restrictive voter ID laws, with racially disparate impacts."No. The wrong direction, was the SCOTUS ruling that states cannot require proof of citizenship during voter registration. This of course, means an illegal is more likely than a minority citizen to vote and be heard, which gives them more power.That's just wrong.</comment>

<comment>How many documented cases are there of illegals voting?</comment>

<comment>How long is a circle?</comment>

<comment>So you've got nothing here?</comment>

<comment>http://www.washingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>Wow. And six percent of 12 million is....a good number. Thank you for the link. </comment>

<comment>Keep in mind, the study referenced has a small sample size and thus by nature is weak.  What can be safely said is that the study demonstrates why checking & preventing illegal votes is important to a functioning Democracy.</comment>

<comment>Depending on study - 14% of non-citizens are registered to vote and an estimated 6.4% voted in 2008 and 2.2% voted in 2010.Keep in mind the study leans conservative.http://www.sciencedirect.com/s...</comment>

<comment>Can't find the citation.  In which scientific journal is that study published?</comment>

<comment>The study was published in Electoral StudiesVolume 36, December 2014, Pages 149–157.The original link above contains the name of the information and the option to purchase the study.http://www.sciencedirect.com/s...The link below has a free copy of the study"There is evidence that some non-citizen immigrantsvoted in both 2008 and 2010. In 2008, thirty eight (11.3%)reported that they voted, had their vote verified, or both.As with registration, claims of voting and validated.  they voted but didn't, and the portion who said they didn'tvote but did. 71 non-citizens answered a survey questionindicating whether they voted, and also had their votevalidated. Among these, 56 indicated that they did not vote(but two of these cast a validated vote), while 13 indicatedthey voted, of whom five cast a validated vote.  The adjusted estimate of 6.4 percent for 2008 is quite substantial, and would be associated with 1.2 million noncitizenvotes cast in 2008 if the weighted CCES sample isfully representative of the non-citizen population. To producean adjusted figure for 2010 we cut by three quartersthe estimated number of non-citizens who voted butclaimed they did not (somewhat larger than the drop in thenumber who self-reported voting). This produces an overallestimate that 2.2 percent voted in 2010."http://www.judicialwatch.org/w...</comment>

<comment>Thank you.  Unfortunately I ran into trouble.  On Judicial Watch I did find a legal brief that mentioned the study but when I clicked on the study in that brief I got an error message which said that an exception occurred when processing the request and another occurred when executing the custom error page for the first exception so the request was terminated.  I don't know if authors still send out reprints of published articles but if they do I can request one from the senior author.  The Judicial watch did give an abstract which repeated some of your post and gave the authors' names but not their affiliations.</comment>

<comment>According to Robert Reich "the best evidence shows no more than 31 credible incidents of fraud out of a billion ballots cast".</comment>

<comment>In voter fraud is essentially non-existent in the US.</comment>

<comment>So are crimes committed with assault rifles. We know it happens here and there but statistically it is insignificant.</comment>

<comment>And?</comment>

<comment>And yet we have massive campaigns, marches, much wailing and gnashing of teach in order to put an end to both of these issues. I think it's important to understand the emotional impact they have on people even if the numbers don't paint them as particularly damaging problems.</comment>

<comment>For example?  Where do you find the emotional impact and how is it measured?</comment>

<comment>1 illegal voting incident = 1 assault rifle incident ?And, just so you know, proving statistical significance of any sort with rare events is virtually impossible.  Where did you learn math ?</comment>

<comment>"gnashing of teach" is a pretty good one! I'm giving you an upvote for that.Seriously.Best phrase I've read in a long while. I'm sharing that with every teacher (especially English teachers) I know. They'll love it!</comment>

<comment>Killings are obvious.Bums being given booze and cigs to do a straight ticket, isn't as obvious.</comment>

<comment>"Bums being given booze and cigs to do a straight ticket, isn't as obvious."But it still shows up in the paranoid fantasies of many on the right.</comment>

<comment>Votes being bought, sold, and given to those who are not citizens should be everyone's nightmare.</comment>

<comment>They are at least a common fantasy among a certain type.</comment>

<comment>So?</comment>

<comment>They keep repeating this "racially disparate impacts" hokey. Yet, last elections, the areas with voter id laws and higher turnout among the minorities that were said to be impacted by these laws. They say it's harder to vote or getting the id poses disparate impacts, but at least in my state, it's super easy. The list of acceptable ids is astounding, and then if you don't have any of those, you can get free ID from the state board of elections. And personally, knowing my driver's license works for my ID versus a piece of paper I got in the mail months ago makes voting so much less stressful.</comment>

<comment>Using 2014 as the source year (non-presidential year) helps by giving the stats to prove the argument. Why not use 2008 or 2012, where the low-information, Identity Politics were glaring.And the only ones not supporting Voter ID laws are those in the Party who would benefit from the fraud it allows. </comment>

<comment>Why not cherry-pick to get the results you want?</comment>

<comment>As was done</comment>

<comment>2014 is the most recent election</comment>

<comment>But not a presidential election. Obama made a huge difference in the demographic stats the author wants to highlight, and what we are running on now.</comment>

<comment>You're correct in that the percentage of black voters went up in the recent presidential elections. But you cannot assume that the remaining nonvoters would have been more similar to voters in their attitudes toward government programs, etc. It is possible that the nonvoters in those years would have been even more strongly in favor of those things. Perhaps the best data would have compared people who have never voted to those who always vote, but I suspect that on these attitudinal measures the results would only be a little bit different, and possibly would strengthen, not weaken, the author’s conclusion.</comment>

<comment>Why would only one party benefit from fraud?How do you know identity politics increases in presidential elections? Even if it does, what does that have to do with your point, which I believe is to suggest that in presidential elections voters and non-voters are more similar, which would undercut the point the author made?As to that point, it is quite possible that voters and nonvoters are more similar in presidential elections, but it does not automatically follow from the fact that turnout is higher. It could be true that voting is higher in presidential elections increases by similar amounts among groups that usually don't vote and those that do. It could also be that the people who don't vote even in presidential elections are even more apt to support government programs than the ones who do, which would actually have made the author’s point stronger. However, even if your guess turns out to be right (i.e., voters and nonvoters are more similar in presidential elections), the magnitude of the cited data suggests that there would still be a significant difference between voters and nonvoters.One is of course free to argue about whether we should care about these differences.</comment>

<comment>Most  Repubs have no issue obtaining or supporting the law. It's Holder & Dems who don't want it...hmmm.</comment>

<comment>By “the law” I assume you mean voter ID laws. There is no question than one party mostly supports them and one party doesn't. Your “hmm” suggests this raises suspicions. If it does, suspicion must fall on both parties. Presumably this split is explained by the idea that voter ID laws will help one party and hurt the other. But without actually looking at the effect of the law and the manner in which it benefits one party and hurts the other, there is no way to determine who truly deserves the “hmm.”</comment>

<comment>"Why not use 2008 or 2012, where the low-information, Identity Politics were glaring." Indeed. The last time so many Confederate and Gadsden flags were seen, they were at Klan rallies fighting segregation. Plot-twist: You're the low-information voter that you're so disparaging of.</comment>

<comment>The Brennan Center has estimated that 11% of qualified voters do not possess government-issued photo ID so that the net result is voter suppression.  Those most likely to lack that ID are the youngest voters, the elderly, the poor and minorities.  Of course someone who lacks voter ID may fall into more than one of these categories.  These groups would certainly differ in their voting trends from other voters so the expected results of these laws would be lower voting totals and different percentages for the candidates.</comment>

<comment>Your voter suppression chunk flies in the face of the voter id laws in place.http://elections.virginia.gov/...In VA, you can use a good number of different IDs (not all are government issued), and if you don't have one you can get a free voter id from the state at any time during the year. Even on election day. AND, if you don't have an ID come election day, you can fill in a provisional ballot and show proof of ID by noon that Friday.</comment>

<comment>That may very well be true in Virginia but each state is different.  In other states such as Wisconsin, North Carolina, Texas and Kansas the situation is different.  In Pennsylvania one of the legislative sponsors even boasted of how many would not be able to vote because of the law.</comment>

<comment>It is true in Virginia, I linked the proof from Virginia's State Board of Election site. There's no, "very well may be," it is. As for the others you list.Wisconsin - http://bringit.wisconsin.gov/d...About the same as VA, and a free state ID is possible as well.North Carolina - http://voterid.nc.gov/index.ht...A little less options, but absentee ballots can be done without ID (in almost every state this is true though), out of state licenses can be used, and provisional ballots are allowed for things such as, "lack of proper documents, family obligations, transportation problems, work schedule, illness or disability, among others."Texas - http://votetexas.gov/register-...A little less options like NC, but otherwise in line with the rest. Texas does have a "permanent exemption" possible and the time after provisional ballot is made is a bit longer than VA'sKansas - http://www.gotvoterid.com/vali...A bit in between Texas and VA on range of ids. I'll ding them for the rules being a tad bit harder to find. All the above I could just type, "[state] state board of elections" and their state websites usually had an easy to find Voter ID section.Pennsylvania's law looks like it was struck down, so I can't go to a SBE site to verify, but given the above, I can't imagine it being that onerous. PA does have online voting it looks like. So any ID laws would be moot to a certain degree.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the helpful information.  Unfortunately, what concerns me is that many if not most of those individuals who lack an acceptable voter ID would also lack the resources to obtain one.  For the elderly, minorities and the poor access to a computer to do what you did may be difficult or non-existent.  On those states with a free state ID it is not clear how easy it is to obtain one.  In states with poor public transportation those who lack a drivers license may not be able to go to a place to obtain one which may be miles away with limited open hours.  Also they may not be able to afford taking time off from work to obtain one.  These are barriers that occur to me offhand; there are probably lots of others.Your mentioning of absentee voting is interesting.  As voting experts like Richard Hasen have noted in person voting fraud is a very inefficient method to illegally swing an election.  Absentee ballot fraud is more effective but its extent is hard to quantify and is largely unknown.</comment>

<comment>There are varying exceptions for elderly and the poor in those laws. If you remember the NC law allows exceptions for "work schedule." VA also allows employee IDs which would mitigate the work schedule aspect as well (I know, not all jobs give photo ids). But I can't see an argument that these laws are hindering them when a) as you say, it's not clear if it's difficult (or easy), and b) in the states that have voter ID laws, most had their turnouts increase the years after implementing: http://www.politifact.com/pund... And c) some of those issues are also reasons people don't vote at all. You might not even affect those factors if you remove voter ID laws to begin with.The outcome doesn't seem support the hypothesis. Now the article I link does note that right not it's not statistically significant and it'll take time to tease out the effects. But as things are, it doesn't look like id laws are hurting turnout. If I had the time I'd track down the voter turnout by state and compare the turnout of state's that have strict ID laws versus those that don't.Another factor to consider here is, other countries have much more stringent voter ID laws. Mexico requires one ID that has biometric data on it and you have to get it in person. Some of the states we talked about allow the ID to be mailed.As far as absentee ballots go, the issue there that needs to be addressed is better clean up and maintenance of the voter rolls. MD and VA an election or so back had something like 50,000 duplicate entries. I'm not worried about the fraud argument from those opposed to the voter ID laws, because those opposed to them also like to suggest online voting as a way to make voting easier. And that has the same if not more inherent problems with regard to fraud/abuse.</comment>

<comment>In some states turnout has been significantly lower.  However, the black community is very sensitive to voting rights as members in the past have died for the right to vote.  So that stimulated them to come out in record numbers because they perceived those laws as a threat.  That may not be true by others threatened with vote suppression.  If the courts don't intervene we shall see what happens next year in states where these laws are in effect.</comment>

<comment>The reason they turned out to vote means nothing. If they're able to increase their turnout the laws probably aren't hindering them all that much. A group's sensitivity to an issue is meaningless as well. Unless it is actually doing what they fear, it's not a problem. Anything else is just politicians using their fear to get their votes.And, "black community...members in the past have died for the right to vote," is kind of a hollow appeal. There are plenty of others in this country who've had their fellows die for the right to vote and for others to have the right to vote. My Irish and German ancestors were physically barred at times from voting. And sometimes election days ended in rioting where said neighborhoods were vandalized.</comment>

<comment>I think for a change you missed the point.  Irish and German Americans in general are in general not deprived of the opportunity to vote by voter ID laws.  Minorities are as I mentioned before are.  You appear to be too young to remember but in the 1960s there were a lot of deaths among black people who were protesting segregation and especially their being deprived of the right to vote in the South.  These deaths were more often among the rank and file than among the community leaders although many of the latter were also killed.  Thus among minorities black people have an especially strong reason to vote and are especially motivated if difficulties are thrown their way as they were in the 1960s and earlier.  Other minorities, non-minority poor people and non-black seniors and young people do not have that history and are more likely to be discouraged by obstacles instead of being challenged by them.   This probably explains why the results have been mixed; where the black population is relatively high voting may be increased and where it is relatively low vote totals tend to be lower.</comment>

<comment>I think you missed the point of that last paragraph. I'm sorry when did the amount of deaths matter with respect to the reasons. And voter ID laws do not deprive minorities the right to vote these days. Maybe in the past, but not today "in general" as you say.Just because the discrimination was different or not quite as pernicious doesn't meant it wasn't discrimination and it's not relatable. Irish and German immigrants were a minority and the KKK assumed they were all Catholics and went after them just as much if not more (by some accounts) as they did Blacks. Burning crosses, bricks through windows, churches burned, etc.</comment>

<comment>FTA: Percent Voting, by Family Income Bracket (2012 and 2014)"low-information"Oh, the delicious irony.</comment>

<comment>Shame on you - Income bracket does not assume low-informationer. Voting as per Race, Gender, Sexual Orientation does-herd mentality.</comment>

<comment>"Income bracket does not assume low-informationer."No, no it doesn't.  The best determination is right-wing political orientation, as you so beautifully demonstrated.</comment>

<comment>More false assumptions. I'm not a right-winger. Shame on you. </comment>

<comment>Your comment history here speaks far more loudly than your claims.  You appear to either have a shameful lack of self awareness or just shameful mendacity.  Or perhaps you are so shamefully ignorant you have no idea what right-wing means...</comment>

<comment>Examples please? You seem confused. However, if you are some super lefty, then I might seem pretty conservative. But by sane people standards I'm very Moderate. I'm in the majority on my beliefs- might want to get out in real world sometime.</comment>

<comment>While this is pointless, you've use typical belligerent right-wing rhetoric here like the absurd "shame on you" which I reflected back for entertainment purposes.The term "low-information voter" is a favorite of Rush Limbaugh trop, popular among the right-wing. Given repeated studies illustrating the massive degree of misinformation and poor understanding of political issues among the right, who are consistently the least informed voters, it's also wonderfully ironic."Most Repubs have no issue obtaining or supporting the law. It's Holder & Dems who don't want it."Far-right positioning.  That also makes it look quite a lot like you are a supporter of the voter-id laws designed by the right to disenfranchise the poor, and minorities, a favorite tactic of the right-wing everywhere.You also made a few feeble-minded efforts to take a swing at identity politics and suggest that this is somehow a domain of the left while casually dismissing the widespread use of identity politics on the right.In answer to your other question, when I said, "comment history here" I really meant "comment history here."</comment>

<comment>Ha what I thought. You are not pointing out policy, just "offensive" terminology. I'm very aware of my policy positions. Maybe you libs might want to lighten-up. And read up on Identity Politics- the left  own that one- Feminists, BLM, Gays, Genders, etc. No offense and no angry tone. :)</comment>

<comment>I am sure you have no idea what right-wing means.  I pointed out your right-wing tropes and you respond with a typical (confused) right-wing diatribe.</comment>

<comment>Ha ok </comment>

<comment>"That also makes it look quite a lot like you are a supporter of the voter-id laws designed by the right to disenfranchise the poor, and minorities, a favorite tactic of the right-wing everywhere."That is bogus. Requiring voter ID is designed to keep non-citizens from voting. That isn't a racial or wealth thing...simply doing what is fair for your own citizens.</comment>

<comment>"Requiring voter ID is designed to keep non-citizens from voting."No, that's just the latest excuse now that xenophonbia and nativism are all the rage.The original excuse was to prevent plain old voter fraud perpetrated by regular citizens. As vote fraud studies by election experts have shown, every documented case of voter fraud wouldn't have been prevented by voter id, so it only prevents imaginary fraud.  On the other hand, while the stated claim of the purpose is false, there are already been many reports of documented cases of voter id laws preventing legitimate voters from voting in TX week documented by the Brennan Center for Justice and other groups monitoring Voter ID law disenfranchisement (there are also documented cases of voter disenfranchisement in Kansas and elsewhere, feel free to research), while the people you'd assume the GOP would want disenfranchised were just the people that were disenfranchised .  The motives are transparent to anyone who isn't an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Right. An amazing post, full of judgement and sweeping statements, while utterly devoid of facts to back it up.And of course all who don't share your view, are idiots.I wish you a lovely life.</comment>

<comment>An amazing post, full of judgement and sweeping statements, while utterly devoid of facts to back it up. I wish you a lovely life.  Also you are an idiot, though not because of the fact that you disagree, but by the way you do so.</comment>

<comment>Btw- how can you see my history. It's private. </comment>

<comment>So, progressives are so ineffectual that the people who support progressive policies cannot even be inspired to vote. Interesting finding. </comment>

<comment>That's a lovely strawman.</comment>

<comment>You really need a dictionary. I provided a hypothesis that is not rejected by the data.A strawman is where someone falsely ascribes a position to an opponent and then refutes that position. </comment>

<comment>You misrepresented the argument -- strawman.Or if you believe it comes from data -- then it's an ecological fallacy.</comment>

<comment>I misrepresented nothing. I provided an alternative hypothesis for the observed results.My hypothesis is not rejected by the data at hand. And this is not an ecological fallacy.Dictionaries are free online now. Try one. </comment>

<comment>Appeal to dictionary is a fallacy unto itself.  Have a good day -- you're clearly here to to troll.</comment>

<comment>That is not trolling. Is it not enough to merely disagree with him?Your definition of “straw man” is in fact strained, but in any case he is stating a hypothesis, as he says. An alternative hypothesis would be that the same things that make one support progressive policies also make one less apt to vote.</comment>

<comment>An hypothesis can also be that the moon is made of green cheese -- that doesn't support that this isn't a strawman or ecological fallacy.</comment>

<comment>All fallacies are not straw-man arguments. If it is a fallacy, you should be able to explain why. My alternative hypothesis is one possibility. However, my main point is that he wasn't being a troll, which I take to mean someone who posts merely to rile up people, and your calling him that seemed to me to be just a way of name calling, as opposed to actually explaining why his argument was wrong, which you didn't do regardless of what you call it.(Were he an actual troll you should not have responded, as he would have been achieving his end.)</comment>

<comment>Republicans are so unpopular that they have to gerrymander and make it harder for people to vote.  They know that if most people voted they would never win.</comment>

<comment>I believe that in paragraph 9, the author meant to write, “They're also less likely…” rather than “also likely.”</comment>

<comment>"create more competitive elections." To a politician, in anything other than a one party system, that is the definition of: worst idea ever.</comment>

<comment>If it were up to me voting would be mandatory. There would be a federal holiday during which each eligible citizen would have their opportunity to vote. They would each have a state-issued ID that served to prove their eligibility, and they would go and do their civic duty on Election Day.</comment>

<comment>The only way this could be fair is if people can vote for "None Of The Above." If NOTA wins, a special election would have to be held in which none of the candidates from the general could appear on the ballot.</comment>

<comment>You can spoil a ballot now.  In the last gubernatorial race in my state I vote for every other position but the governor as I didn't like any of them.</comment>

<comment>That's not "spoiling" a ballot. As long as the ballot is filled out correctly, votes for other races still count even if a vote is not cast in one of them. Refusing to vote for bad choices is not wasting your vote; refusing to show up and cast any votes at all certainly is wasting your vote.</comment>

<comment>How much participation did you make in defining those choices?  I certainly agree that there is structural problems with the US model of democracy, but the amount of time that most of us dedicate to changing the model doesn't really justify sitting ANY election out...</comment>

<comment>I don't know. I really like New Zealand's way of voting, in which one is given the option not only of voting for their favorite candidate but also in giving secondary votes to other candidates running in the same race such that if their primary choice is eliminated then the ballot they cast can still rate a level of favor for the next few candidates in line.</comment>

<comment>Instant Runoff Voting would be a huge improvement in our system.  I believe that many more people would vote for minor parties if they could specify a second and even a third choice.</comment>

<comment>In Nevada they can vote for none of these candidates.</comment>

<comment>I agree 100%. I also think the electoral college should be abolished. If you're a liberal who lives in a solid red state or a conservative who lives in a solid blue state, your vote for Senator and President are wasted.</comment>

<comment>Actually, if you are any voter in these states your vote is wasted.</comment>

<comment>That's true. Even if you're in a state that votes for the candidate you want, it's not like your vote is making a big difference. You could stay home and that candidate would still win the state.</comment>

<comment>I am only half joking when I say that soon a heavily Democratic state will pass a law saying that every registered voter will be "deemed" to have voted for the incumbent running for re-election.  You will only need to vote if the seat is "open" or if you want to try to remove the incumbent.</comment>

<comment>An excellent theory from a well-informed voter!</comment>

<comment>"A new study suggests that increasing turnout could have significant ramifications for policy."Err... Yeah.Isn't that why every possible attempt to reduce voter turnout is undertaken? I thought that was well known and understood?Are people stupid these days or just naive?Don't they teach cynicism at school anymore?Or am I the only one who thinks this author sounds like they just got out of kindergarten with the level of credulousness displayed about the integrity of "democracy" in terms of delivering what John Q. Public wants policy-wise in this article? Seriously? This is a surprise or something?I suppose the fact that the topic of discussion is the single most damning indictment of "democracy" as it exists today, is probably something that should be shouted from the rooftops all day long, but I honestly thought everyone knew this already.I guess I expect too much knowledge of the average person. Still though, it's rather galling. I mean, isn't this information as obvious as the sun in a clear sky at noon?I really must lower my level of assumption about my fellow humans. Not only are they worse than I think they are, they're probably worse than I can possibly imagine. Well Carl Sagan did twig me on to this possibility. I guess I don't measure up to my own standards.So it goes.</comment>

<comment>It is not obvious that voters and non-voters disagree on their attitudes. As the author states, many people have assumed otherwise. Obviously you knew all this, but please indulge the rest of us.</comment>

<comment>So you're saying you've never heard of the study on which policies which are favoured by elites vs. average people (both voters) actually get enacted? I see.BTW, the odds of some policy favoured by the majority of people polled is quite low. The odds of some policy favoured by elites (economic elites especially) is quite high.That's it in a nutshell. My father pretty much told me that in not so few words when he dandled me on his knee lo those many decades ago. Apparently fathers (and mothers for that matter) don't tell children these facts of life very much anymore.So it goes.</comment>

<comment>|So you're saying you've never heard of the study on which policies which are favoured by elites vs. average people (both voters) actually get enacted? I see.|I said nothing of the sort. I have in fact heard of that study. First if all, as you note, that study compared elite voters versus non-elites rather than attitudes of voters versus nonvoters, which is the topic of this article. I might have guessed at those differences, but it was useful to see them quantified. Second, even if the elite vs nonelite study was relevant to this discussion, and I'd say it barely is, it can be useful to see further discussion, conforming (or non-confirming) evidence, etc. Third, just because you don't find the article newsworthy doesn't mean no one will.As I said, you may have complete information on this, or indeed all, subjects, but please indulge the less intelligent among us. Perhaps if you believe the information to be old news you could post something that would add to the discussion rather than simply letting us know how well-informed you are.</comment>

<comment>If 4 people go out to eat, and 3 of them have an opinion but do not voice it because the driver is going to choose where they want to go it does not make the driver's opinion better.It just means the other 3 know that they can argue and debate but they will just be wasting their time.</comment>

<comment>That is their own fool fault for not speaking up</comment>

<comment>Move Voting Online.Problem solved.More details:Give everyone a voter ID that is linked only to an email address.When person votes, their voter ID is thrown into the voter database with every one of their choices and they are emailed a selection of their votes.They can then go review those choices in real time to ensure that it was counted accurately.  This being a publicly available database would ensure a few things.1) Your vote was captured accurately.2) Other's votes are captured accurately.3) Real time data on voting patterns / immediately identify people or systems who are incorrectly (purposefully or otherwise) miscounting votes.I mean, currently partisans count votes in a back room.That is a recipe for a disaster.Every vote not made online is uploaded to this database in order to have 100% transparency to identify persons miscounting votes.</comment>

<comment>Folks have problems with a Voter ID Card, and you want to make it emails?</comment>

<comment>Yes.People have a problem with evolution also.  Doesn't mean we should not ignore ignorant opposition.</comment>

<comment>If people won't get IDs, how do you expect them to have a verified email that can be tied to one person, and not whoever is using JohnDoe5497@aolcom?</comment>

<comment>Voting online?It would be hacked during the first election cycle.The only amacare website still doesn't work right</comment>

<comment>You are right, lets take banks offline, because being online by default makes them insecure.</comment>

<comment>Id be fine with that.  I think people who use online banking are stupid as they get.Banks will be hacked, the question is when not if</comment>

<comment>My hometown is so white, it's filled with people who don't vote, not because they're itinerant, ex-convicts, stuck at work (Oregon is vote-by-mail), or discouraged by voter ID laws, but because "it's all Skull and Bones anyway, man. Fluoride will burn holes in your brain, so stop brushing your teeth with fluoridated toothpaste or you'll keep being one of the sheeple. Pass me my Camels, will you bro?"</comment>

<comment>It's like the same problems with capitalism are the same problems with democracy.If companies were actually accountable to their customers/clients, capitalism would be great just as if elected public officials were actually accountable to their citizens/constituents, democracy would work out great.Except human psychology being what it is....holding or demanding accountability from others is just not our strong suit.</comment>

<comment>The 2014 election turnout was the lowest percentage since 1942 when of course some potential voters were in foxholes and the Republicans won the highest number of House seats since 1928 and took control of the Senate.  As is generally known turnout is higher in years with Presidential elections and Democrats have won the popular vote in 5 of the last 6 Presidential elections.  (Even though Gore lost the electoral vote he did get more popular votes in 2000 than Bush.)  These results suggest that at least in recent years low turnout favors the Republicans and a higher turnout favors Democrats.</comment>

<comment>The turnout was pretty similar to turnout in the 90s.  Obama actually brought out a lot of people who probably won't be voting this time around.</comment>

<comment>Some of Obama's voters might vote for Carson if their Dem choice is Biden :)</comment>

<comment>We shall see what the turnout will be in 2016.  There is some anecdotal evidence that Latino turnout may be stimulated by comments by Trump and a few other candidates but nothing at all like polling data.  By all indications it should be higher than last year.  If it isn't I fear it will be a sign of despair.</comment>

<comment>I have no doubt that turn out will be higher than 2014 but I can't imagine hillary getting out the youth, or black vote in large numbers which is essential to the Democrat strategy</comment>

<comment>You are assuming that Hillary will be the nominee as virtually everybody assumed she would be in September 2011 but for the purpose of our discussion let's assume she will be.  From what I've read she is predicted to do well in the black vote now that she is not running for the nomination against Obama.  However, I think your point about the youth vote is a likely outcome.</comment>

<comment>Obama got record high levels of black vote and turnout.  That was critical to Obama s victoryHillary will get an average turnout</comment>

<comment>We shall see.  As I wrote it is not yet certain that she will get the nomination.  However, my educated guess if she does that she will get almost as good a share of the black vote as Obama is based on the following:  1) That is a reasonable description of how her husband did with the black vote and 2) the present consensus is that in running for the nomination against Bernie Sanders she will get an overwhelming proportion of the black votes in the primaries.</comment>

<comment>So many words to explain the simple fact that the lower income people have less time and less interest in participating in the political process.</comment>

<comment>i have a lot of friends who are commited leftists, angry at the government and ready for the revolution. None of them vote. When i point out how absurd it is to complain about politics and not vote, they claim there's no point in voting because the rich control elections.If the Koch Bros/Mansanto/ALEC etc really are out to get us, their greatest ally is liberal apathy and enui. There's no law you can pass that will remove people's heads from their @$$es.</comment>

<comment>The Koch brothers are well matched by wealthy donors from the left.In the end, the wealthiest 0.01% are investing in BOTH parties. Risk management investment. </comment>

<comment>I tend to agree. The Koch Brothers are outliers of the typical high spending donor in that they're high profile and overtly partisan. Not only do both parties manage to raise and spend ridiculous sums on campaigns, but at some point it appears to be a complete waste of money. In California, several Republican candidates spent more on their campaigns than entire national election used to cost ($180 million for Meg Whitman's disastrously inept run for governor!). They all got clobbered. A lot of campaign spending is in fact a business operation bordering on a scam. This is true especially among Republicans who have a lot of printing business owner/conservative activists who know just the guy to print all those campaign signs for the proposition they came up with.Besides, these politicians are such @$$holes, they'll bail on you even after they take your money. George W Bush threw Enron over under the bus in five seconds. Without Enron, Bush never would have "won" Florida.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats also have their rich patrons and scams, let's not forget that.Interestingly, politicians of both parties increased their net worth dramatically in the same time period that the average American household saw their net worth drop forty percent...</comment>

<comment>Voting is a revolutionary act.Vote.</comment>

<comment>I know that I will.</comment>

<comment>No wonder Democrats desperately try to get borderline illiterate people to vote via automatic registrations and mail-in ballots. Oh, and tacitly endorsing illegal voting by blocking voter ID laws is a nice touch too.</comment>

<comment>How many cases of illegal voting have prosecuted over the past 50 years?</comment>

<comment>Do you mean to ask how many occurred or just how many were actually prosecuted. Because, tellingly for our country, elections have been affected by massive noncitizen voting and nothing has been done about it: http://www.washingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>Uh, I would urge you to re-read that article and the numerous caveats about the research methodology the authors have included.  Furthermore, the examples they cite are cherry-picked in order to illustrate a possibility, not conclusively state a certainty.  A similar comparison would be to ballot spoilage; miscounting and poorly designed ballots certainly account for a marginal percentage of lost votes, but it is impossible to totally eliminate these factors, or definitively state that the spoilage was to the benefit of a particular candidate.  We work to make the spoilage as small as possible, but there's a limit to what you can achieve when the entire populace has to vote on the same day. We recognize a point of diminishing returns on these efforts, where the effort to reach zero spoilage begins to reduce the overall number of people who can vote, which is counterproductive to say the least.This is exactly the goal of people who "worry" about illegal voting: to make the process as arcane and time-consuming as possible, so that only those people with enough capital can afford to spend the time having their voice heard.  Unfortunately, this practice was largely endorsed by the Founding Fathers, who had an enormous blind spot on who exactly comprised a citizen (land-holding white guys, who may or may not be Catholic), to put it mildly...</comment>

<comment>They should not put party affiliations on the ballots.  That way only prepared people who know who to vote for and why would count for voting.</comment>

<comment>:) it wouldn't favor one socioeconomic group over another either...lots of rich idiots vote a straight ticket, as well...Then again, some people might be too intimidated to vote.</comment>

<comment>I personally have no problem with our elections being decided by people with the minimal awareness, competence, and motivation required to register to vote once in their life, know when election day is, know where their polling place is, and either find time within a 12 hour window to get to the polling place or request an absentee ballot far enough in advance to be able to drop it in the mail by election day.</comment>

<comment>true, but isn't wanting to increase turnout really a way of saying that you want more people to have the minimal awareness, competence, and motivation?  Even if we do not change voter registration laws, how could a greater percentage of the population having 'voter faculties' be a bad thing?</comment>

<comment>Wanting to increase turnout doesn't necessarily mean wanting voters to actually think critically about the slate.  It can just mean wanting a greater supply of easily-manipulated or bought lemmings.</comment>

<comment>depends on what you want to do to increase turnout.  if you want to change the requirements for voting, such as relaxing registration requirements, that's one way.  Another (harder) way would be to try and foster more civic engagement.  Neither party really seems interested in that.  The Dems want to get more people out on election day, but don't really care if they are engaged the rest of the time (some Dems would even prefer that they not be).  The GOP wants to limit the electorate because they have spent a great deal of political capital over the last 40 years locking up a certain segment of the population - a segment which is now shrinking in proportion to new demographic groups (which are weakly Dem by default).  Not wanting to lose the advantage they have with white middle class voters, the GOP's strategy is to tamp down the numbers of other voters who aren't guaranteed GOP votes.Both parties are afraid of engaged voters</comment>

<comment>Why not make the process even more selective by posting up some volunteers in front to conduct literacy tests?  Life isn't some even playing field where you get to pick arbitrary stuff and decide that's what makes the measure of a man. If we have a dumb populace making dumb decisions, that's on us.And don't bring up some Idiocracy nonsense either; there's no objective measure that says people as a whole have been doing anything other than getting smarter ever since they invented democracy.</comment>

<comment>If it were up to me, anyone on welfare would not be able to vote, nor would anyone belonging to a public sector union.   Once voters learn they can use their vote to tap the public treasury, democracy and the free market will become a fond memory.   In a few words, if you don't have skin in the productive economy, you don't get a part in deciding how the money is spent.</comment>

<comment>This is not news!  This info has been a part of most politicians strategy for decades.  The fact is politicians do not have to concern themselves with non-voters!!!!</comment>

<comment>#blackvotesmatter</comment>

<comment>This article misses nonvoters who live in overwhelmingly red or blue areas, where your potential vote is either superfluous or or is overwhelmed by voters with the opposite viewpoint.  If the Electoral College were done away with and the President was elected on a straight popular vote count with no reference to geography, that encouragement to vote might well lift voter participation in general.  At least it would for this older/richer/whiter person who cannot be bothered currently.</comment>
