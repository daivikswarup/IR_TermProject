<comment>"This is, in the abstract, a compelling point. The trouble is that the weight of the scholarly evidence directly contradicts this argument."I didn't think it was that compelling to start with, to be honest."Colorblindness" is a silly term. Using a metaphor leads to vagueness as to what exactly we are talking about.Conor casts a critical eye on the left in academia, which is a good thing. He can get a bit "concern trollish" in his framing when I think he wants just to say, "Look at how stupid these people are!" with their microaggressions and so on. But he does call conservatives out on more important race issues too. I would be interested on his take on whether racism is coming into the libertarians from their intersection with the Tea Party...</comment>

<comment>Any political party that is predominantly White will have major issues with racism. Even the democrats do even though a lot of us would like to deny it. Hillary and Bernies treatment of the blacklivesmatter activist has been appalling and what else can we make of Bernies talk about getting tough on illegals?</comment>

<comment>Any other lies to tell?</comment>

<comment>Democrats controlled the south when slavery was a thing, the KKK was the militant wing of the democrat party, they arguably still keep blacks down by increasing the minimum wage, fail to acknowledge their right to own a gun so they are victimized by gangs that don't follow the law, and created a victim complex that people like the white guy that created blacklivesmatter can use to have his minions interrupt politicians who try to speak. At least Bernie was involved in the civil rights movement in the 1960s when it was more involved than just a hipster hashtag and a facebook 'like'.</comment>

<comment>And you forgot to include all the white ppl that DIDNT vote for Obama because he's black. Or I guess all white ppl only voted on the issues. Right. Blacks are mostly racist?? Thanks for the biggest laugh I've had this week. Talk about false generalizations. The fact that you can't own up to even what the article is talking about says it all. Probably didn't comprehend it.</comment>

<comment>He is only half black and the black half really resents the white half.</comment>

<comment>"keks invented your black lives splatter, I'm always a victim therefore i am". Thomas Sowell 1981</comment>

<comment>Conservatives you mean. Are you a liberal or something? And why are you so enamored with, and insistent that we fly, the Confederate flag if you're a Republican? You're all just ret@rded parrots. </comment>

<comment>No, I mean democrats. Read an actual history book. And I don't insist anyone fly the confederate flag nor do I mind if they do. I just find it funny that democrats perverted the symbol they now demand removed. They even fought republicans to keep it up as early as the 1990s.</comment>

<comment>Read an actual book. Democrats in the 1800s were Conservative, as were the Dixiecrats in the South that now vote Republican. The Democratic Party divided in the 1940s between North and South, by the 70s the Dixicrats moved to vote Republican.The people fighting to keep the Confederate flag in the South are Republicans.</comment>

<comment>But that's just factually wrong and revisionist. All of the Dixiecrat politicians rejoined the democrat party except for two. And democrats frequently still won state and local elections in the south long after the civil war. The south became more red as republicans moved south looking for work and democrats and their mentality died off.</comment>

<comment>You are just making shit up and you know it.The transplants from the North moved mostly to cities, cities in the South are mostly Democrat and liberal. The Republican voters in the South are the Confederate flag waving 5th Generation Southerners.JFK was a Democrat, he won without the Southern vote.  He fought against the conservatives in the South, including those who claimed to be in his own party.The rednecks voted for Nixon.The rednecks voted for Reagan. The rednecks did NOT vote for Barack Obama.</comment>

<comment>JFK wouldn't do squat about civil rights for fear of losing support of southern democrats. He was not a leader on the issue, he was a follower and a user. That leader was MLK and only after polls showed majority support for integration did JFK take it up as an issue. When it was safe for him to do so politically. MLK wouldn't declare a party as to not alienate either side but his father was a republican. You don't know anything of history and just want to cling to your magical flip theory where parties suddenly swap mentality overnight yet insist at the same time that geographic location can retain racism. It's such a moronic notion that there is no way to take you seriously. But typical of Dems not to be accountable for their actions and blame others.</comment>

<comment>I am sorry you are unable to read actual books. It must eb difficult going through life with such extreme ignorance.</comment>

<comment>Resorting to insulting people because you are wrong just shows your lack of education.</comment>

<comment>I insult people who deserve insults. If you are such a cry baby at being called stupid then you should not say stupid things on the internet.Put on your big girl panties and get over it.</comment>

<comment>But you deserve insults because you are obviously an unhinged lunatic. Yet you aren't insulting yourself. You should.</comment>

<comment>Were you born with that brain damage?</comment>

<comment>Ask me about brain damage when you vote for a socialist or someone that has clearly committed a felony by deliberately mishandling classified info in an attempt to avoid FOIA requests.</comment>

<comment>Democratic Socialism is not Socialism.7 investigations by Republicans have shown she broke NO LAW.  Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Well I don't care about republican investigations, I'm talking about the 100+ FBI special agents. Funny to see how someone that supported the prosecution of both Manning and Petraeus will try to argue why she is above the law. At least now the democrats aren't trying to hide the fact they are socialists. So called 'liberals' play cute with words to get people to drink the same old poison.</comment>

<comment>No one said she is above the law. She has been cleared of wrong doing by the people who hate her. They could not find any in their witch hunt.And no one is playing cute with words, words have actual meanings, even if you are too ignorant to know them.</comment>

<comment>She hasn't been cleared of anything. The FBI hasn't even put forward their recommendation yet. It will be amazing if they don't recommend an indictment considering who they prosecuted in the past for less. The only question is if Obama will have Lynch fail to prosecute. But that will create even more problems for Hillary and Obama. Not that you care, you'll vote for whatever hack promises the most free stuff and pretends to have altruistic motives in growing the powers of government. Prediction: Obama will pardon Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Indictment for what crime exactly? Come on name it. Cite the law that was broken.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure the FBI will cite the crimes specifically. It's generally believed they will involve:  the Federal Records Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the National Archives and Records Administration's regulations, and Section 1924 of Title 18 of the U.S. Crimes and Criminal Procedure Code. That's assuming it doesn't extend further into the Clinton Foundation. It's certainly worse than what Petraeus was accused of and yet she supported his prosecution.</comment>

<comment>It has already been investigated and dismissed. Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>That is simply factually wrong.</comment>

<comment>www.http://www.realclearpolitics.com/vide...</comment>

<comment>Your proof is Hillary's opinion? Wow.</comment>

<comment>BTW, no one claims the parties SUDDENLY switched. The Democrats began splitting under FDR. The Dixiecrats remained separate throughout the 1950s and 60s.You obviously have never been to the South if you think modern Republicans down here are the transplants...But please, do call John Lewis's office and explain to him how the Civil Rights Movement worked. I am sure he would get quite a few laughs.</comment>

<comment>John Lewis is a race baiter and nobody cares what he laughs about. He has become a parody of his old self. And I didn't say modern republicans are transplants. But transplants helped change the south. You have very poor reading comprehension. But as slavery defending dems lost control and died off, republican ideas flourished. The Dixiecrat politicians folded right back into the democrat party. The democrats, having lost on slavery, found a way to backdoor it with the entitlement culture. They haven't changed at all. It is true that both the north and south have their share of racists. Northerners tend to live in denial because "durrr civil war". But the reasons many in the north were against slavery was just as racist by today's standards as the reason the south supported it. It wasn't about the morality of it for most, it was about the economics of it.</comment>

<comment>John Lewis is a Civil Rights Hero. But thanks for showing how mush disdain you have for the Civil Rights Movement. It shows who you really are.Transplants in the South are mostly Democrat and liberal.The Dixiecrats did not vote for Barack Obama. The Dixiecrats did not elect John Lewis. You really have no idea what you are talking about, you are just making shit up.</comment>

<comment>John Lewis traded whatever rep he had to be a partisan hack for the same people that fought against civil rights. He is now just a leftwing smear merchant. Current transplants in the south do tend to be dems from failed northern cities.  And no, they don't seem to admit the politicians they elected there screwed them over. And yes, they will probably vote for the same stupid politicians and cause the same problems in their new home. They are like a virus in that way.</comment>

<comment>I am one of the people who voted for him and you are a liar.Again, you keep making claims about people that are absolutely FALSE. If you ever actually went to the South you would know that</comment>

<comment>I think you just like to ramble and I have no reason to believe you actually live in the south either. You can be anyone on the internet and you choose to be stupid.</comment>

<comment>I am fourth generation Southern, you calling me a liar does not change that. See, unlike you I have lived in the South and been a professional historian for decades.</comment>

<comment>Well I come from a long line of historians. I'm a historian, my dad was a historian, and my great grandfather was one of the first african historians enslaved and sent to the south so you could one day have a token black friend.</comment>

<comment>Again you just make crap up about me just like you did about John Lewis. Why do you lie so much?</comment>

<comment>The stubbinkins doth protest too much, methinks.</comment>

<comment>You lie repeatedly and it is my fault somehow?</comment>

<comment>Everything you don't like to hear must be a lie. Good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>No, the things you claimed that have no basis in reality are lies.</comment>

<comment>You don't even acknowledge the FBI is currently investigating Hillary. Which the FBI formally confirmed two weeks ago.</comment>

<comment>http://www.politifact.com/trut..."Our rulingBush said Clinton is "under investigation with the FBI right now."Not quite. The FBI is conducting a general inquiry into the security of Clinton’s private email server. But law enforcement officials have said Clinton herself is not the target of the inquiry, and it is not a full-blown criminal investigation.Clinton’s actions are clearly front-and-center in an FBI investigation. But Bush goes too far to claim Clinton herself is under investigation. We rate his statement Half True."Now I am curious, when are you guys going to investigate Colin Powell and Condaleeza Rice for having their emails the same way? And when will they be charged for the millions of Bush emails that were erased? After all, if it is such a huge deal ... why isn't it a big deal for other Secretaries of State?</comment>

<comment>Damn you're stupid.http://www.cnbc.com/2016/02/08...And Colin Powell and Rice didn't create a sperate email server for the intent of avoiding FOIA requests that might be inconvenient for a future presidential run.</comment>

<comment>Blacklivesmatters activists treatment of others - especially whites, has been appalling.  They more than deserve to be called out for false race baiting, advocating violence, etc.  Of course some racism still exists - but the activists proclaim racism even when NONE was involved - in fact they readily engage in racism themselves.Racism isn't magically exclusive to whites - in fact at this point, even blacks believe that more blacks are racist than they believe whites are racists - and of course the majority of blacks are Democrats.  In fact a number polls and studies have shown that there are about as many racists in the democrats as republicans - and historically speaking, there were always far MORE racists in the Democratic party.  After all, the Republican party was formed to fight slavery, and Republicans supported suffrage for woman and both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in far greater numbers than Democrats along with any number of other civil rights legislation over the years.More Americans View Blacks As Racis† Than Whites, HispanicsAlso surprising considering the recent race riots/protests:  Expert: Blacks trust police more than whites do</comment>

<comment>No, only white people have the power to be racist in America. Share with us the ways you are the victim of racism as a white person.  I'm white,  I am not victim of racism in America. Conservatives have victim envy. They are racist frauds who have an irrational hatred of people of different races, particularly black men. Always have. </comment>

<comment>Time for you to learn the definition of racism.  Try actually looking it up in the dictionary.  The "only whites can be racist" meme is utterly bogus.  One doesn't have to have "power" to be racist - one only has to be a bigot against another race, and act on it with either word or deed.  In fact, these days, even blacks think more blacks are racist than whites in America.More Americans View Blacks As Racis† Than Whites, HispanicsAnd if you've never been a victim of racism, then you are a very unusual person who's either extremely sheltered or never around many people of other races - or your very oblivious.  That, or you're simply lying.  Virtually everyone has experienced some form of racism at some point in their lives.There's absolutely zero "victim envy" involved - that's simply your own projection of twisted false assumptions.  It's perverted and absurd.  You're probably one of those who also claims that anyone who says anything negative about Obama is automatically a racist too.</comment>

<comment>You're speaking about micro-level prejudice, not racism. I'm talking about institutionalized racism. White people benefit, nonwhite people don't. That's what racism is. The fact you don't have to think about race ever, and in fact it seems like it's a nuisance to you, means you have white privilege. That's what racism is.</comment>

<comment>"You're speaking about micro-level prejudice, not racism"Wrong, I'm talking about RACISM, PERIOD.  Not "micro-level prejudice" at all.  As to institutional racism, which is NOT what you said, what do you think Affirmative Action, and hiring quotas based on race and not qualifications, etc., are?  Or how about scholarships specific for minorities but totally unavailable for whites?  And exactly what institutionalized racism exists in the USA against blacks today?"The fact you don't have to think about race ever, and in fact it seems like it's a nuisance to you, means you have white privilege."What an utterly stupid thing to say.  It clearly shows you haven't got a clue what you are talking about - worse, you resort to magical thinking, assuming you know what other people do or don't think about, even how they FEEL about things, when clearly you have zero way of knowing.  In your mind, apparently, whites don't have a right to think about race, and they're never discriminated against - that, my friend, is YOUR racism talking.  You try moving into a predominantly black or hispanic or asian neighborhood, or go shopping in stores that are run by minorities with minority employees, or taking a job at a company that's primarily minorities, and then tell me it's not an issue and you never have to think about race. Try going to schools where there are a significant percentage of minorities, and tell me the same.Now consider the existence of things such as The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Black Entertainment Channel (BET), United Black College Fund (UBCF). MIss Black America, Black Soul awards, Black Student Pride Associations, Black History Month, etc., etc.And consider what the response would be if anyone tried to establish corresponding groups with the exactly same stated goals and mission, but specific for whites only: The National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP), White Entertainment Channel (WET), United Caucasian College Fund (UCCF). MIss White America, White Soul awards, White Student Pride Associations, White History Month, etc.All he!! would break loose and any associated with them would immediately be utterly vilified and labelled racists.You have a horrible set of double standards and are hypocritical as all get out, and you don't even see it - or will never admit it.All you are doing is proving your own racism and prejudices - and your ignorance of the real world and even the meaning of simple terms such as racism itself.</comment>

<comment>I'm not reading your novel describing how righting past wrongs makes pathetic losers like you the victims of racism in society. I frankly don't give a s#it whether you dinosaurs understand what racism and white privilege are. You're addicted to victimization and revenge. But there aren't enough of you to matter anymore and you know this,  which is why you're desperately trying to get others to listen to your emotional tirades about how white males are oppressed in America. All you do is read from the same mindless script. I've heard it a million times and will never be persuaded to believe I'm the true victim in America because we let black people own property and attend college.The oppressor does not get the same protections as the oppressed.  Your analogies are fukcing ret@rded. </comment>

<comment>While you're on you're omnibenevolent campaign to destroy the evil white man and right all of history's wrongs heres a few quotes you might want to keep in mind."History is indeed little more than the register of the crimes, follies, and misfortunes of mankind." -Edward GibbonOr are you just selectively choosing which historical wrongs you want to right?"Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster...for when you gaze long into the abyss. The abyss gazes into you."- Friedrich NietzscheLastly for someone who seems very concerned with protecting groups with little power saying "retarded" isn't exactly kind to the mentally disabled who are arguably one of least powerful groups of people in America.</comment>

<comment>The world is passing you by. It's up to you to figure out how to deal with that. Not my problem. You can get on the bus, or be left behind.</comment>

<comment>My dear, you've got major mental problems and a massive chip on your shoulder.  Get help.</comment>

<comment>Once conservatives are out of their bullet points they resort to this. Lol. </comment>

<comment>...as always, indoctrinated teeny-bopper prog morons have nothing but their eternal preening and mouth-queefing.</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot to keep spewing this nonsense after 40 years of affirmative action/diversity programs that have been interpreted and utilized to benefit literally EVERYONE except straight, white men.But of course, you'd have to actually put some time into the workforce to know the difference between real-life and the PC line of garbage your professors spoon-feed you.</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action policies were never meant to help straight white men you pathetic loser. We don't need help, you freaking imbecile, we were the oppressors. We're the ones who benefit from centuries of oppression. We don't need a leg up you pathetic victim addicted piece of garbage.Jesus Christ, Conservatives are losers. </comment>

<comment>I'm an agnostic, you indoctrinated moron. Have you ever asked yourself how you could be an "oppressor" without ever oppressing anyone?</comment>

<comment>No, because the answer is obvious. I can recognized that I benefit from  historical oppression in this country. You could recognize that too without blaming yourself as an individual, you understand that right?  Just because you acknowledge that you don't suffer because of your race in this country doesn't mean you're to blame for institutionalized racism. </comment>

<comment>And I would still love to hear all your tales of being a victim of racism. You know, the racism that doesn't exist except where you're the victim. </comment>

<comment>I'm hardly going to sit here and catalog my personal experiences on a public forum on your whim, especially when anecdotal evidence is meaningless to the discussion.</comment>

<comment>Because there aren't any. You're simply a victim envious fool. </comment>

<comment>I see, so now you believe you have magical powers of ESP, and you know better what has happened to someone else you've never even met than they do themselves.You can get help for such mental illness you know.</comment>

<comment>Let's see. You've spent the past three days posting angry retorts to a story about racism because you're NOT a racist? Lol. </comment>

<comment>You really are a troll.  I've posted zero "angry retorts" - yet again you think you have ESP.  Nor have I posted anything that's even remotely racist.  You're a typical liberal troll who thinks you somehow win simply by playing the race card even when there's no basis for it.  It's pathetic.</comment>

<comment>Racists don't see their own racism, shocking. You don't even believe racism exists. Well, except where you are the victim of course. Lol. </comment>

<comment>Most racists know full well they're racists, and they'll tell you so.  Clearly there's no point in wasting any more time with your nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Nothing like a self-racist, self-loathing liberal. They once had a word for it, I think it was 'nutjob'</comment>

<comment>How cute!</comment>

<comment>Racist much?</comment>

<comment>"Antiracist" is a code word for antiwhite. </comment>

<comment>As a direct descendant of Guy Fawkes, I wish leftists would stop using my ancestor to push their Marxism and anti-white racism. If Fawkes was alive today he'd be plotting AGAINST the elite progressive establishment, their corrupt power-monging and their fake "anti-racist" pose.Oh, and don't look now but Fawkes was a white man. If he was here to see the way Marxist racialists have appropriated his image he'd jam a bomb up George Soros' effete little elitist Nazi-collaborator backside.</comment>

<comment>"Anti white racism." lol. Please tell us all the ways you're hindered by being white in America, racist fraud. I'm white. I would never make the claim that I am somehow a victim of my race in America. You have to be a lying fool to make that claim.</comment>

<comment>You're white AND a lying fool.</comment>

<comment>I could make you quite a list but you'd just dismiss every instance and call me a liar. Ah, what the hell. Let's see... There were the two separate counsellors in college that told me a white guy would qualify for a low-interest loan "when hell freezes over" no matter his financial circumstances, there was the time around age 18 where I wanted to apply for a city-government job where my Hispanic friend worked-- they paid three times what I and most of my friends made-- and he said he'd be glad to put in a word for me but "sorry dude, they don't hire white guys"-- he was right, btw. There were dozens of other times when jobs were designated AA hires and they didn't even interview white guys, and then a few other dozens where they'd interview them for show-- and the promotion would end up going to a woman or minority-- just like everybody knew it would.I also spent 6 years working for a Fortune-500 company and was privy to every word spoken at every board meeting-- I saw and heard how terrified these executives were of being targeted for baseless accusations of "RAAAACISM!" from Jesse's Rainbow Coalition and other similar shakedown groups. I saw and heard the set-asides and quotas they used to dole out high-paying jobs by skin color and gender with my own eyes and ears.You can keep calling me names and say I'm a "LYING RAAAACIST!!" all you want-- it won't change the reality I've witnessed over 25-plus years in the workforce.How many years have YOU spent in the workforce? Or are you just another naive 20-year-old delivering lectures based on what you learned at school?I'm thinking I already know the answer to that one.</comment>

<comment>Racists always blame black people for their failure. You don't qualify for a low interest loan because those were specifically designed to level the playing field. There's no reason to give white people low interest loans in colleges where white people are the vast majority. No government employer told you you can't have a job because you're not Hispanic, that's patently ludicrous. And then of course you go into the Jesse Jackson nonsense to prove once again that you're just an aggrieved racist. You have every advantage in life in America as a white person, it's up to you to take advantage of that. Funny how you worked for a fortune 500 company yet you claim to not have any rights as a white person. Pathetic.And the answer is 28 years. I'm in my mid 40s. Not that it's relevant. But if I didn't have a job could I just blame black people for taking all the jobs?</comment>

<comment>Quit twisting my words to fit your narrative. I never claimed anything of the sort-- I simply recounted SOME of my run-ins with affirmative action/diversity programs. At the time I didn't say a word. I just accepted that that's how it is-- but now I'm through staying silent since "RAAAACIST!"-screaming posers like you have taken to giving sanctimonious lectures on "white privilege" after decades of being legally discriminated against.Btw, what in the hell does slavery have to do with a poor 18-year-old getting a low-interest loan? Explain why they're available to the well-off son of a black dentist but not too a white kid from a poor family. Try to do it without all the emotional histrionics and quivery, butthurt lip though.Jesus, man. You're WAY too old to be believing in these left-wing fairy-tales. Must work on a college campus.Thanks though, for doing exactly what I said you'd do-- asking for "proof" of anti-white discrimination and jumping up and down screaming "LIAR!!!" and "RAAAACIST" when it's given.</comment>

<comment>I'm too old to not blame everybody else for my failures in life? At what age was I supposed to start getting mad at black people because life isn't fair?</comment>

<comment>More endless sanctimony and baseless assumptions. I've done quite nicely, thanks. I live in a very nice, safe, affluent neighborhood, in a 3,500-sq foot house on a lake with my wife of 20 years and two kids. I'm very thankful for all that I have but EVERYTHING I have, I EARNED-- and I didn't "oppress" anyone or have anything handed to me simply because I'm white.I don't "blame" black people for anything-- I'm simply pointing out that your leftist critical-theory twaddle does not reflect reality for most Americans.You zealots want to deny reality and logic-- you want eternal, endless affirmative action/diversity programs at schools, businesses and government agencies across the country-- while simultaneously pretending these policies don't have any negative effects. It's simple logic: if one group is given special protections and considerations, it only follows that another group is being discriminated against.Racial discrimination was wrong back in the 50's when it was applied to black people and-- news flash!-- it's STILL wrong when it's applied to white men-- no matter how noble it makes you feel.Equality under the law is the ONLY non-racist policy BY DEFINITION.So the only question is: which college have you spent the last 25 years working at?Oh, and why do you believe blacks are so inferior they can't compete without hand-holding by smug, paternalistic progressives?Oh, and why do you want to deny them the simple dignity of succeeding through merit instead of racial set-asides? Why do you want to promote dependence and resentment between races?</comment>

<comment>How precious. You brag about your successes in life to prove the white man can't get ahead in America. And then go right back to the cynical racist nonsense I replied to in the first place. Typical conservative tactic. Enjoy your fabulous life, poor victim of racism! </comment>

<comment>Typical smug prog lies and hypocrisy-- first it's baseless accusations of "blaming black people for your FAILURE!" and when I clarify what I meant it's-- "oh, you're BRAGGING about your success, raaaaacist white man!". Heads I win, tales you lose.Quit dodging though-- what college employs your effete little indoctrinated backside? Why do you think blacks need your "help" to succeed? Why do you want to deny them their dignity? Why do you want to promote resentment between the races?Oh, and who have you "oppressed" other than the sane people that have to put up with your constant sanctimony and indoctrinated whining?</comment>

<comment>Because you're just spinning around in circles. One minute you can't get a loan or a job because you're white, the next Jesse Jackson is oppressing your fortune 500 company while you live in your lake house. It's freaking ludicrous. I truly believe conservatives don't want other people airing their legitimate grievances because it takes time away from your incessant whining.I don't answer strawman arguments, moron. And what's next, you'll ask for my social security number? I know it's hard for you loons to believe, but not all white people sit around being angry at women, gays, and minorities 24/7.</comment>

<comment>Obviously people who ambush and shoot policemen they've never interacted with have ZERO knowledge of whether those policemen are racist or not.  They're just murderers, looking for any excuse, plain and simple.  And if you were REALLY concerned about supposed "systematic extermination" of your ethnic race, you wouldn't be up in arms about a small number of police shootings that are often in self defense or to protect others - you'd be up in arms about the millions being voluntarily aborted by their own ethnic mothers.Or you'd be up in arms about the thousands being murdered, by their own ethnic brothers.  After all, about 93% of the many thousands of black homicides every year are committed by other blacks - not by police at all.So gee, I guess if you really want to partake in what you're calling "self defense against ethnic extermination", you're in a real pickle, a paradox, because you'd have to be shooting your own since they're the guilty ones the vast majority of the time.And do you REALLY think that no whites are shot by police either?  Think again.  Typically when it happens, it never even makes the news - or at least not national news - and certainly no one has been rioting over those or burning their own neighborhoods and destroying innocent businesses or shooting police over it.</comment>

<comment>self defense?! exterminated?!... man you got it twisted. Besides, there are plenty of officers of color who have been taken out by criminals.</comment>

<comment>Of course you do.</comment>

<comment>yeah, sneeking up on a coop pumping gas and shooting him from behind is self defense.</comment>

<comment>What a racist you are.   You know nothing more than a black shot a white cop and you conclude it's self-defense.</comment>

<comment>So, shooting a cop in the back of the head while he's pumping gas is "self-defense"?  Wait, I know!  He was defending himself against global warming!</comment>

<comment>The fact you can post such utter idiocy and have it infuriate moral people shows how powerful racism is. Black people don't have fighting words to use against white people. White people have countless fighting words to use against black people. And they do it constantly on the Internet.</comment>

<comment>Can your whining liberal.''Moral people'', would have stood for these murdered-by-black men cops.You cowards chose to cap on guys like Trump or regale the rest of us on how great the Iranians are instead.</comment>

<comment>I don't know what bubble you're living in, but the most racist whites I know are more often saying: "one day we'll run all the niggers and spics out of this country."Maybe your experience is that closet racists in multicultural areas hide behind colorblindness, but there are many areas where colorblindness is the antidote to virulent racism. Most, if you're looking outside elite circles.</comment>

<comment>Name some of those areas, DJ.</comment>

<comment>Another massive double standard.  If a white says those things, they must be racists.  But if a black says them it's uplifting and inspiring.  Or have you forgotten the words of Martin Luther King, Jr.?I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.~~Martin Luther King, Jr.When a person makes a blanket claim as you just did, it's a very good bet that you are one of those types who sees racism in anything and everything, even when absolutely none exists.</comment>

<comment>Finally, a place where I can jump in-----MLK's little children.  Have you ever seen a mixed pre-school class of children the first few days of school ? "Your skin is brown."  "Yeah, yours is kind of pinkish."  "Look, hers is sort of yellow-brown". "Do you want to go play on the slide ?"  Lots of comparisons of the differences are made and that is it----UNLESS the parents or the teachers make a big deal out of it. The kids just sort of forget about the differences, because other things about the kids at school are more important.</comment>

<comment>Yep, I pretty much agree.  And if they've already been around kids with different skin pigmentation than their own, you won't even hear that.  They just start playin' together and being kids.</comment>

<comment>The burden of proof on bigotry should be on the person accusing.  How did racism become the default setting in your world view.  Your avatar speaks to it.  You're just a troll</comment>

<comment>I'm not going to justify anything. If you don't  what I say as a white man, swing on me or STFU.Black people are a mere 13% of the population. They are not 25% or 50% of the population. Black people are never going to have the exclusive  social and economic  power they demand because there simply aren't enough left.We are not going to suddenly become a permissive society where it is okay to sell dope openly on street corners..</comment>

<comment>The most racist folks I've encountered make a lot of stupid statements like yours, guy.</comment>

<comment>Ironically, you're saying that yourself in a roundabout way, and proving your point -- with regard to yourself.As for the rest of us, I'm not so sure.</comment>

<comment>What tripe.  The author and others like her are interested in color consciousness as opposed to color blindness because it justifies their professional existence.  It also serves as a rallying point for a political party that relies on a narrative of racial inequality to keep a fractious political coalition together, and provides a whopping dose of self righteousness in the bargain.</comment>

<comment>I notice your argument lacks any scientific basis.  The author on the other hand provides studies to back up his claims.  This is a common problem with this discussion.  People on your side of the debate often just get defensive and never even attempt to prove your point.  You just react emotionally.</comment>

<comment>The problem with aforesaid "studies" (which incidentally have few to no hallmarks of actual science: controls, blinding, randomization, experimentation, falsifiable hypotheses) is that they beg the question. What the sociologists have done is asked devoted members of antiracist groups which explicitly avow the uselessness of color blindness how they came to those groups. Of course those who come to hold beliefs like that will affiliate with groups that match their beliefs. It's pure selection bias.It would be much more interesting to conduct studies, first covertly selecting for racial bias and lack of racial bias, and then asking participants how strongly they identify with their race and whether or not they belief race is core to the identity of others. In fact, if you look, you'll find several more scientific studies have been done on that; the results may surprise you.Take an example from drawn from life: the most strongly "White"-identifying groups are… racial supremacists.</comment>

<comment>Two thumbs up for using 'beg the question' correctly.</comment>

<comment>wow ANOTHER sucker who just accepts anything labelled a "study" or "science" . . . sad really</comment>

<comment>"studies"...Well, I guess that proves it.</comment>

<comment>Time for you to learn what actually constitutes an unbiased scientific study.  Little hint, it's well known and proven over and over that the vast majority of sociologists are LIBERALS - and their studies are fraught with blatant confirmation bias. Sociology, like psychology, is a notoriously "soft" science - e.g., one where most of the work cannot be falsified and often can't even be replicated.  And you want a few studies to back that up?  Here's a start for you:Jonathon Haidt (a liberal himself) has some great work on the liberal bias in Universities, espec. Ivy League Universities, so if you have any intellectual integrity, his work is a good place to start researching this (this just a article) from the liberal New York Times:  Social Scientist Sees Bias WithinAlong those same lines:  Liberal Bias in Academia Reaches New LevelsHarvard Humanities Professors Admit Liberal BiasSocial liberal/fiscal conservative Michael Bloomberg (Independent) on the liberal bias at Harvard:Michael Bloomberg bashes liberal bias at Harvard commencement addressBloomberg: Universities becoming bastions of intolerance</comment>

<comment>Kudos, Db8!I believe liberal bias in the humanities has given us generations of leftist / socialist government policy, and the people who will implement them. If the bias of higher education is not addressed,  we will lose the Republic. This "cancer" has spread to our high schools and elementary schools by young, brainwashed educators. On this crucial  front, they are winning. :-(</comment>

<comment>Oh, and if you are unfamiliar with the scientific concept of falsification, listen to a reading from the father of science; Sir Karl Popper's "Science as Falsification"  And then you'll have a far better understanding of why any sociology, psychology, etc., ought to be taken with a huge grain of salt and carefully examined in terms of methods and procedures before you ever consider calling it "science."</comment>

<comment>lol -- science?They argue that as the mechanisms that reproduce racial inequality have become more covert and obscure.Sounds like they are making up their belief in racial inequality because they can't see it!It's like saying: "There must be bank robbers, even though we have no evidence they are robbing banks.  We just "believe" they are still there!"</comment>

<comment>The miserable science of sociology provides no facts as this article does not either. There are no facts. A professor notes; or observes is not a study nor a fact. The fact that many of the "experts" quoted have no experiments that are repeatable and papers based on observation without real context should bother you but I'm guessing you have a preconceived idea and will look for things supporting your point of view. Which is exactly what they did.</comment>

<comment>Christopher:  The author is stating that if MLK were alive today that his dream for color-blindness (from "I have a Dream Speech" which is where people like me started their equal rights activism)  "actually allows people to ignore manifestations of persistent discrimination."Promoting racism as a means to counteract racism is not productive.</comment>

<comment>Classic-- progressivism operates ENTIRELY on emotion and the biased, self-serving "studies" you progs always rely on to guide you about reality have nothing to do with "science".</comment>

<comment>The main argument in the article is self-contradictory.</comment>

<comment>As it stands there are too few lobbying organizations for people of color, women, and the sexually diverse. The Democratic party at least pretends to concern themselves with those populations. If it were up to you, they'd have no representation at all. </comment>

<comment>Too few lobbying organizations for this that and the other special interest group?! Are you nuts?</comment>

<comment>I guess you've never heard of the Congressional BLACK caucus, The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Black Entertainment Channel (BET), United Black College Fund (UBCF). MIss Black America, Black Soul awards, Black Student Pride Associations, Black History Month, the many different black scholarships, the many different Gay Pride Parades, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (IGLHRC), International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (ILGA), International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Youth and Student Organisation (IGLYO), Gay and Lesbian International Sport Association (GLISA), Advocates for Informed Choice (AIC), BiNet USA, Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), Adler, Pollock, and Sheehan Diversity Scholarship, etc., etc., etc., etc.Your comment is too absurd to even be laughable.</comment>

<comment>And imagine the hew-and-cry if there was:The Congressional WHITE caucus, or the National Association for the Advancement of White People, or the White Entertainment Channle, or the United White College Fund, or Miss White America, or White Muscian Awards, or the White Student Pride Association, or White Pride Parade, or White International Sports Association.You get the point!Racism?  Oh hell yes -- against whites!</comment>

<comment>"At least pretends" includes building inner city slums, brainwashing black youth into thinking they're considered second class citizens, and aborting every black baby they can get their hands on, Mike.</comment>

<comment>To racists like you, vibrancy is the equivalent of "inner city slums". And why shouldn't black women have access to prenatal health care? Wow. Just wow. </comment>

<comment>Hilarious. Gov't housing projects are vibrant and killing black babies is prenatal health care.Creepy White Mengelian Prog MFer!You are a pox on America and a pox on humanity!</comment>

<comment>And you know I'm white how exactly? </comment>

<comment>By your Creepy Mengelian Prog MFer comments, Mike. It's obvious.A pox!</comment>

<comment>And what exactly do they need separate representation for? Ah, its the money thing. Got it.</comment>

<comment>"If it were up to you, they'd have no representation at all."MIke, do you seriously believe all people of color must share the same political orientation?  All women?  All the sexually diverse?We have a word for people like you:  prejudicedWould you even entertain the idea that a black lesbian business owner might think her business is overtaxed and overregulated?</comment>

<comment>"MIke, do you seriously believe all people of color must share the same political orientation?"Of course not. I merely recognize that various groups vote Democrat as a whole, though not without a handful of exceptions,  and that increasing their numbers will sweep straight, white Xtian males from power. The current system only represents historically oppressive groups rather than the powerless. Thankfully demographic change will alter that radically. </comment>

<comment>Blind race-hatred and laughable academic "blame-whitey" indoctrination hiding behind cheap, sanctimonious finger-pointing.</comment>

<comment>The current system is, to a big extent, the system of free market, where people are mostly free from government coercion. What you want is the system to oppress people, and surely you won't end with oppressing only White people.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I can't wait until we get new, more diverse oppressive groups.   That will be swell.Can't wait to see what they do to fellow travelers like you, if they get real power.</comment>

<comment>Is this supposed to be farce? If so, it's brilliant. If not, it's laughably absurd.</comment>

<comment>What do you think?I was responding to a post that now has 61 upvotes to 6 for mine. Clearly The Atlantic has become a conservative hivemind.  At least a handful of us are trying to be the voice of sanity in a sea of racist, right wing nonsense. I'm disappointed in almost everyone here. </comment>

<comment>No. As evidenced by their publishing this indoctrinated leftist drivel, the Atlantic is a reliable left-wing mouthpiece-- just like always. The disparity in upvotes is a simple fact of mathematics: despite a century of near-total control of propaganda sources, such as the media, academia and entertainment industries-- the people with common-sense still vastly outnumber the indoctrinated.</comment>

<comment>Common sense: maintaining the status quo of racism, sexism, speciesism, homophobia and xenophobia.</comment>

<comment>The "status quo" for the past 40 to 50 years has been ubiquitous affirmative action/diversity policies, racial quotas and set-asides and one-sided "hate-crime" legislation in schools, businesses and government agencies across the country-- and the only thing these "progressive" policies have brought to the black community is 70%-plus fatherlessness, massive dependence and widespread disfunction....but, hey, what's endless failure, bankruptcy and mindless race-hatred as long as democrats keep getting 90% or so of the black vote and progressives get to feel noble?Equality under the law is the only fair, non-racist policy BY DEFINITION.</comment>

<comment>Straight white males have presided over the whole failed regime, yet you try to blame progressives who've yet to seize power for the state of things in our vibrant communities.If you want see the potential realized when progressives are given a chance I'd refer you to Chomsky's articles on the Khmer Rouge. Of course, you've been indoctrinated with decades of lies so you'll likely dismiss his scholarly work on this important topic entirely. </comment>

<comment>You want to see a "failed regime", head anywhere in the world where white people hold no sway. If you'd prefer not to leave this country that you hate so much (and who could blame you?), Detroit or Baltimore will do.</comment>

<comment>White people built both Baltimore and Detroit. Coded within both racist societies were the seeds of their own demise. Naturally they abandoned both cities when they could no longer profit from the exploitation of people of color. Nice try though. </comment>

<comment>Detroit was more powerful economically than either New York or Los Angeles 50 years ago-- before it was run into the ground under exclusively progressive rule. Blame "eeeeevil white republicans" all you like, they haven't been in charge there in a half-century.</comment>

<comment>Latinos have been in charge of Los Angeles for a few decades and it's vastly more successful than the white male-led Baltimore and Detroit. </comment>

<comment>"White-male led Baltimore & Detroit"? Laughable. Black progressives and white progressives have run both cities and have for decades. The operative word being "progressive"....but feel free to point out all the wonderful, peaceful, tolerant "utopias" scattered across the parts of the world where there are hardly any white people....for that matter, feel free to point out the African nation that offers a higher standard of living for blacks than the U.S.</comment>

<comment>Correct you are sir.. I grew up in detoilet..</comment>

<comment>Once the vampires suck the lifeblood out of a city, they move on and leave people of color to try to pick up the pieces. This is cspatalism in a nutshell. </comment>

<comment>Capitalism has lifted more people out of poverty worldwide than any statist, collectivist, Marxist-inspired scheme in history ever DREAMED of.Most of the "poor" in the U.S. live better than kings used to over the previous 10,000 years. The first country in history where the biggest health-hazard of being poor is OBESITY-- and STILL you Marxists whine and scream "raaaaaaacist!" as if the word still meant anything other than "person that disagrees with progressives".You should really get out and experience the rest of the world before mindlessly regurgitating anti-American, anti-white, Marxist critical-theory nonsense and cheap sanctimony.</comment>

<comment>You can keep your ridiculous lolbertarianism. It's crazier then the anarcho-communism I used to believe in. </comment>

<comment>racism according to liberals is the right of people to live their lives free from government coercion.</comment>

<comment>I wish.</comment>

<comment>exactly, and how embarrassing. fact is people from my parent's generation are BETTER human beings than the fetid ilk that trots out this drivel. we were taught to be color blind in meeting people, i.e., don't assume anything based on color of skin when you see or meet someone. we were ALSO taught about racism in America and how other races have been significantly disadvantaged by it.  NOTHING the least bit contradictory between the two. the "author" is literally just making up lies.</comment>

<comment>Black America had one shot at fixing their problems with Obama.  Had Obama begun his White House years trying to encourage African Americans to see Michelle and him as an example of the opportunity America offers everyone regardless of color, had Obama said, "Hey, look at us.  If we can make it, you can too," then blacks might have started to emulate their success.  How do you get success?  It's a simple formula for all races:  keep the family unit together, educate the children, work first and play second, and make yourselves and children into valuable, productive members of society.  The thing I liked the MOST about the Obamas was that they were a MARRIED black FAMILY.  But instead of encouraging other blacks, they fanned the flames of entitlement and racial resentment.  Now, as Obama fades away, hope for getting black America to fix its problems are probably fading too.</comment>

<comment>"How do you get success?"Well that depends on how you measure success. There is certainly more to life than income and wealth, and a intact and happy family life is one of them.Bottom line though, if you can't make a decent living for your family, everything crumbles.Unfortunately, it is a certainty that, from an economic standpoint, blacks as a group will simply be unable to emulate the achievements of whites, and it would be dishonest to tell them that they can. So for 50+ years, we've been lyin' and cheatin' our way to try and achieve supposed equality.How has that worked out so far?</comment>

<comment>"Unfortunately, it is a certainty that, from an economic standpoint, blacks as a group will simply be unable to emulate the achievements of whites, and it would be dishonest to tell them that they can."I'm sorry, but that's a ridiculous statement.  There are plenty of middle class and even wealthy blacks. In fact, 98% of all blacks who finish high school, and get married before having children, are NOT in poverty and often do quite well.  The problem isn't one of race, but one of the utter disintegration of the family structure - and that we can thank liberal/progressive welfare policies for, starting with the Great Society.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but you appear not to have read my comment, or having read it, you failed to understand it.Of course there are plenty of middle class and even wealthy blacks, and you will find inevitably that those blacks have IQs not dissimilar to middle class and wealthy whites.Any randomly selected black may well equal or exceed the accomplishments of any randomly selected white person. But here is where the "blacks as a group" thing plays an integral part - as a group, blacks have a median IQ which is one standard deviation below that of whites.There are many consequences of this fact (it's been known for close to 100 years). Consider just one - a post-graduate degree is generally considered to require an IQ of at least 115. Based on a normal distribution curve, about 18% of whites could expect to achieve that level of IQ, while only 2% of blacks could reach the requirement.Hopefully this will make it clear why, from an economic standpoint, blacks as a group will simply be unable to emulate the achievements of whites, and why it would be dishonest to tell them that they can.This is not to deny that the "utter disintegration of the family structure" is not a major problem. It just doesn't have that much to do with why blacks underachieve.</comment>

<comment>If IQ were that tightly tied to economic success, all Asians would significantly outperform Caucasians.  Look around the world - quite clearly that's nowhere near the case.  What's more, the IQ gap has been narrowing as nutrition has improved and lead poisoning etc., has decreased.  It's not nearly as written in stone as you believe.</comment>

<comment>I think you have been misinformed - the black-white IQ gap remains the same today as it was when it was first measured - 1SD.As for the Asian IQ superiority over whites, I suggest you compare apples with apples and stick to North America. Have a look at the graph from this article and you will see that it pretty much definitively proves my point.http://www.theatlantic.com/bus...</comment>

<comment>The Flynn Effect and IQ Disparities Among Races, Ethnicities, and Nations: Are There Common Links?  Connecting the Flynn Effect to racial, ethnic, and national disparities in IQSorry, but your while your graph does support your point, it in no way proves it, let alone "definitively."  You would have to factor in selection bias that's occurring in the IQ of Asians who immigrate to the USA.  They are a relatively small population, with a large immigration influx (on a percentage basis) of those who are higher IQ than average for Asians, thus skewing the entire picture.  Plus there are MAJOR cultural differences that have a huge impact - read the article I liked above about the Flynn Effect, and consider what that means when there are major cultural differences with one culture seriously pushing it's population to diminish education, and the other seriously pushing for educational success, etc.</comment>

<comment>Wait. Selection bias? You're seriously insinuating that looking at the entire US population makes the sample size too small? 300,000,000? Really?And what's all this talk about immigration skewing the entire picture? And please, it's not"my graph". It's from the US Census Bureau for Real Median Household Income, covering the period 1967 to 2013, AND the link is to an article from the very website we're commenting on. Just to rub a little salt - in 2013, Asians  $67,065; Whites $58,270; Blacks $34,598. Nice try though!You are bested sir/madam. Be honest and admit it. Enough with the squid ink.</comment>

<comment>Of course I'm not suggesting that the entire population of the US has anything to do with it.  Only a small fraction of the population has even been IQ tested.  I'm talking about the Asian population in the USA that's been IQ tested.  I thought that was pretty darned clear.As to your graph, of course I'm not saying YOU created it - you did, however, link to it for heaven's sake.Hate to break it to you, but for you to rub salt in a wound there has to be a wound first.  There isn't.  Apparently you didn't bother to read the article I linked to."You are bested sir/madam. Be honest and admit it. Enough with the squid ink"ROFLMAO!  My dear, you haven't even come CLOSE to besting me on this issue.  I suggest you take your own advice, be honest, and admit it.</comment>

<comment>I read your link, but the author's presumed (?) conclusion that "The Flynn Effect serves as a reminder that when we give people more opportunities to prosper, more people do prosper" seemed more like wishful thinking than scientific conclusion. Then again, it's only a lightweight magazine piece, so to be expected.Perhaps you might do me the courtesy of reading a link to a paper from an acknowledged expert in the field - Linda S. Gottfredsonhttps://www.udel.edu/educ/gott...A little more impressive, would you agree? Is that article your sole source for your position? One would hope and expect not. Here's a little more evidence for you to peruse at your leisure (actually, quite a lot, really).https://jaymans.wordpress.com/...Liberal/progressive welfare policies have been disastrous. We certainly agree there. But perhaps you need to consider the possibility that you may have things the wrong way around. It's not because blacks have rejected education and family that their "g" is lower than Asians/whites, or that Asians have the higher IQs because they embrace education more. It's IQ first - everything thereafter.Change your paradigm.</comment>

<comment>You've got to be joking.  You're trying to compare a 40 page paper to a single page summary article?  And you pick the a conclusion line of that article and say it sounds like wishful thinking, without bothering to tie it to the referenced research in the article, let along actually following those citations and reading those papers too?  I guess as far as you're concerned apples are the same thing as pineapples too.Of COURSE the article I linked to isn't my sole source - which you would clearly KNOW if you'd actually read the article, since it contained several citations to published research.  Nor are those the only ones either.You present your single article, while ignoring the fact that the article itself even states up front right at the beginning that the issue is highly controversial among the experts.  And you carp about the links I provided, then turn around and give one to an anonymous blogger with no apparent credentials??  Sheesh.As to who needs to change paradigms, I suggest you consider taking your own advice.  You presented a chart before claiming it was "definitive evidence" when it was nothing of the sort.  You ignore all sorts of confounding factors such as the average IQ of Asians who choose to immigrate here, and things such as the fact that the median age of Asians in the USA is significantly higher than that of blacks, which almost always also translates into higher earnings, etc.The article I gave you proves that in fact IQ has been rising far too fast to be a set genetic determinant - there are clearly other factors involved that affect population IQ scores.  Work on your critical thinking skills and apply a bit of skepticism rather than latching onto only those that support your preferred emotional biases.</comment>

<comment>"The article I gave you proves that in fact IQ has been rising far too fast to be a set genetic determinant".Oh please, one fanciful article in a popular magazine represents proof of nothing.  And please don't claim that you yourself have read through all the published source documents for the article you are promoting - if you had you might find that most of the articles cited had absolutely nothing to do with the fanciful conclusion drawn.I have referred you to an absolute boatload of further evidence which you have conveniently ignored. When you have had the time to actually wade through that evidence why don't you get back to me and present your counter argument. Until then take your own advice - apply some critical thinking.But given your penchant for kumbaya thinking, perhaps that's asking too much. I won't hold my breath.</comment>

<comment>Do stop being so obtuse.  The article referenced SEVERAL peer reviewed published papers, and there are quite a few along those lines." And please don't claim that you yourself have read through all the published source documents for the article you are promoting"Why not?  I HAVE read the referenced papers.  It's clear that you haven't. Nor have I ignored anything you've posted.  Your own link - the ONE link you gave that had anything reputable - said right up front that it's a very controversial issue.  Your second link was to an anonymous blog from someone with zero qualifications.YOU are the one trying to ignore anything and everything that doesn't suit your preferred biases and paradigms.  And that's a gross lack of critical thinking on your part, not mine.  I'm the one who keeps nothing that it is scientifically controversial - you're the one who keeps claiming it's nothing but genetics and IQ period, while ignoring all the research to the contrary.Try an honest discussion, why don't you, instead of your psychological projection.</comment>

<comment>It's really sad, that some white americans still committed crimes, got divorces, and had kids out of wedlock after the presidencies of Washington through Bush.

<comment>LOUD NOISES!!</comment>

<comment>This problem will not go away in our lifetime regardless of what you do.   The more you emphasis race, the more a backlash you get.</comment>

<comment>As the only so-called liberal deep in the heart of darkest (insert any flyover state here), the word is, indeed, Backlash. You say you live in Portland or Boulder and don't give a fig for backlash? I say I wish I lived in Portland.One of my conservative friends had an idea, one of many. (Most of them, not so great.) This idea seemed almost...do-able. What if we only assured equality, not preferential treatment? Imagine if all job and housing and loan and rental and college applications asked about race and gender not at all? Would that fix this? It could.I didn't go into the age-old issues of an entire race trying to play catch-up after several generations of slavery, or of nepotism, or of institutions simply bypassing applications altogether, in favor of more "word-of-mouth" modes of operation. Because I think his heart was probably in the right place.Just Imagine...real equality. Imagine no more backlash.</comment>

<comment>That's actually impossible since the suffering of previous generations has been proven to be inherited genetically. So there can never be a so-called colorblind version of equality.

<comment>You desperately need to learn some actual history.  The KKK was founded by, and all it's members were DEMOCRATS, not Republicans.  Add needing to learn some basic genetics too - the "suffering of previous generations" isn't in any way inherited genetically, unless you are talking about massive famines, which do have some effect on offspring's health later in their lives - but that has NOTHING to do with race or slavery.If you actually HAD a conscience, you wouldn't be spewing such nonsense, you'd take the time to learn actual facts.</comment>

<comment>In all fairness, the DEMOCRATS of which you speak, at least those with all the wealth>>>political clout>>>influence over poor whites ("if we let them take our slaves, Mark Our Words, they will come for your land next!"), were largely WEALTHY PLANTATION OWNERS who owned the big  plantations throughout the Mississippi Delta region.

<comment>"Progressive Republicans and Conservative Democrats switched ideologies --in some regions, shortly after Reconstruction. In others, shortly after 1964."Yet another false liberal/progressive bit of revisionist history.  There was NO documentation of any such supposed "conversion."  Nor would anti-civil rights Dixiecrats, hard core DEMOCRATS, have decided to convert to the party that PUSHED CIVIL RIGHTS INTO LAW and the party that FORCED desegregation and ended Jim Crow laws.  The idea doesn't even pass the most basic sniff test.Strom Thurmond is the SINGLE documented shift to Republican of a major democrat - and he only switched for personal political gain.The vast majority of Dixiecrats (racist Democrats) never converted to Republicans - they DIED -- the vast majority are dead by now.  The Civil Rights Act was signed over 50 years ago, after all.  Do the math.Next, there's zero evidence of any such mass conversion ever having occurred.Plus, in the interim there was a huge influx of well educated northern Republicans who moved south (far more so than any immigration moving north) - and if you know ANYTHING about history you know they were in fact the ones who overwhelmingly supported the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, etc.   In fact, the more Republican the south became, the less racist it became.Finally, if you look at the actual demographics, there are still quite a lot of Democrats in the south - and the south didn't even start becoming Republican controlled for several decades after the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, etc.So seriously, get a clue, and stop with the liberal talking points lies and revisionist history already.Here's more factual information on these issues for you:Urban Legends:  The Dixiecrats and the GOPThe “Southern Strategy” Debunked AgainSomeone else posted on this issue (quite correctly):  </comment>

<comment>While there was never a "switch" per se in the ideologies of the parties, it's hard to argue that they didn't effectively swap demographics over the course of a century. In the middle of the 19th century the Republicans represented Yankee progressives, immigrants and freedmen, while the Democrats represented rural whites. We can argue over why this happened, but it is plain to see that today, the Republican party is for middle and working class Whites (not that there's anything wrong with that), while the Democrats are a loose coalition of urban liberals, blacks, Hispanics and other minorities. This may be a fairly recent development, but it is undeniably true.</comment>

<comment>For the most part, that's true.  Although Republicans don't represent primarily rural whites, but also working whites and whites with college educations in all sorts of different occupations and fields.  So the demographics are actually quite mixed - rather than swapped - compared to what they were in the late 1800's (19th century).  I think more minorities are starting to see that in fact the Republicans also represent them - they've just been such a captured group by the Democrats, and people really do tend to vote along the same party lines their parents did, often without even noticing that the party no longer represents them very well.  That's particularly true for poor urban blacks, unfortunately  The liberal/progressive/Democrat/socialist policies, starting with the Great Society, are in large part responsible for utterly destroying the black family structure and leading to the inner city poverty problems we've got today.  For all their hollering about "compassion," they've done far more harm to the black community than they've helped.  </comment>

<comment>There was no switching of ideologies.  That's nothing more than progressive/liberal revisionist history.  In the very early 1900's some did switch parties, but not ideologies (which may be what you were trying to say).  But the vast majority of conservative Democrats in the South who were involved in slavery, the KKK, Jim Crow laws, etc., e.g. the Dixiecrats NEVER switched parties or ideology.  That bit of revisionist history has been debunked time and again.  The southern states didn't even become consistent red states until the 1990's - not back in the 60's.</comment>

<comment>the suffering of previous generations has been proven to be inherited genetically?!! that is a ludicrous proposition. and if so then EVERY person is subject to that condition -and in the positive as well. i.e., the joy of previous generations has been proven to be inherited genetically . </comment>

<comment>Wow. The idea of ignoring race you find appalling? Isn't that nice. Being a biochemist, what is the crap you speak of inheriting genetically? Far from the truth. If it was even marginally true, the mixed races would be inheriting what? The good and bad? You people are crazy.</comment>

<comment>So, what you're actually saying is that their DNA has been changed so that they are predisposed to suffering via racism. Is that what you're actually saying?</comment>

<comment>People who are fanatically sure they have the market cornered on "having a conscience" have been behind every totalitarian regime ever.Nice Chris Hayes/pajama-boy "I'm an intellectual" glasses, though. It must be fun being a real-life Portlandia character.</comment>

<comment>How much drivel can you spew?  If suffering of previous generations are inherited, which is doubtful at best, how did the children of those who suffered during the great depression turn into the greatest generation?  How did children of those who suffered fighting wars manage to survive?  Hint:  Your theory is BS.  And it also ignores the fact that most blacks in America today are not descendants of slaves so it explains nothing.  But you only think in your prejudicial terms, assigning traits to all individuals in a group by race.  You are lost and the opposite of an individualist thinker, btw.</comment>

<comment>Actually if you look into history a little bit, you'd find that blacks a few decades ago were doing FAR better in many ways than they are today.  The vast majority of the problems blacks are having these days aren't because of racism, slavery, Jim Crow, etc. It's because of liberal welfare policies.In fact in large part we can thank the "Great Society" and liberal policies for the destruction of poor families and the massive inner city problems we have today. It's a horrific situation that's been created all by the 'bleeding hearted compassionate' liberal well meant but disastrously implemented policies and a total failure to ever go back and see what the actual effect of such policies are.Don't get me wrong here - individuals are very clearly responsible for their own choices - 98% of people who simply choose to finish high school, get a job, and wait to have children until married are never in poverty.  Even so, the welfare polices strongly incentivized NOT being married, not waiting to have children, NOT having a father involved in supporting the family, having more and more babies if you're a poor single mother, etc., etc.  In other words, those were the "smart" things to do if you were very poor and needed help.  Worse, if you were working and on welfare then earned a LITTLE more, you'd lose everything when there was no way you could make it on the small increase in earnings.All of this was especially true for poor blacks families, which many of these programs targeted far more than poor of other ethnic/racial groups.  Just read a little Thomas Sowell on the issue -- he's not only a highly respected economist who grew up in Harlem and dropped out of high school, but went on later to graduate with high honors from Harvard, and he also happens to be black. His work is excellent, ties in historical facts, and is well worth reading. Or respected economist Walter E. Williams, who also happens to be black, along with others on this subject.

<comment>"The Great Society" was a mistake. Most of us "get" that now. It was wrong. It was counterproductive. Instead of lifting NAM's out of generational poverty and ignorance, it condemned several more generations to more of the same.However, let's be very honest with one another. Through raw greed, 18th- and 19th century (1%-er) slaveholders --along with their trade-partner equivalents in Africa-- CREATED this problem for America.So just who in the he!! should have taken the lead in creating a SOLUTION to the problem, rather than taking a "hands off" approach, because, (a) Any solution was doomed to not help their bottom lines, and (b) This was only going to cost a great deal to "fix," anyway?Pro tip: The SAME demographic who always takes FAR more than their fair share of PROFIT, yet expects the  99% to pay those nuisance EXPENSES for their "brilliant" money-making ideas.

<comment>The weakest point in this piece is when the author appealed to existing sociological scholarship, and had to admit that the measure of success in the scholarship was whether or not white people became 'antiracist activists.'We all know what an antiracist activist whose activities are approved by a university sociologist in America might look like. That person would be one who subscribes to the author's opinion on the topic, rather than Connor's.In other words, this person measured success by whether or not people openly espoused his point of view, then claimed legitimacy for his success by calling it scholarly research.Is it any wonder that most Americans think sociology as a field is a pseudoscientific worthless endeavor, and that these people speak without any ounce of authority?</comment>

<comment>Fortunately these studies are not the only ones on race.  There are many others that show the same thing.  There is an even easier test through; ask a black person how they feel about this.  It's hard to deny the racism in this country if you know people who have suffered through it.</comment>

<comment>Yes, we should just ask a black person. Any old black person will do. After all, they are the indisputable prophets of America's dominant religion. Read the link to learn more. I'm done talking to you since clearly my opinion is meaningless.http://www.thedailybeast.com/a...</comment>

<comment>Ask any old black person? So black people are inherently different than us?</comment>

<comment>Absolutely by liberal standards and the soft bigotry of low expectations espoused by liberals. Of course they are inept and unable to cope with modern life and inferior human beings and that is why the liberals must look out for them as they would any defective or lower being. People like me who believe they are humans whole and my equals are the bigots right?</comment>

<comment>Yeah! That's right! Ask a black person about this. They ALL will certainly give the same answer...the one Christopher Smith is looking for.Now, who's the racist?</comment>

<comment>Ok, so ask them.  Golly gee, seems that more blacks think other BLACKS are racist than they think whites are racist.  Go figure.More Americans View Blacks As Racis† Than Whites, Hispanics</comment>

<comment>We should also ask someone: "Do you think you make enough money?"I'm sure that would PROVE that everyone should be given a raise!What a maroon you are christopher smith -- I've rarely met anyone online as stupid and ignorant as you appear with postings here.</comment>

<comment>that would at least be more accurate than asking Sociologists whether whites are racist - the answer would come back "of course, 100% are racist."Beginning to think Sociologists are just Climate Change "Scientists" who flunked down.</comment>

<comment>Does this include white people being beaten up by black mobs? How about people who were discriminate in college admissions due to affirmative action?</comment>

<comment>so now the intelligentsia posits that belief that there are real differences attributable to populations is racist  AND that denying there are real differences between populations is racist. brain hurts .</comment>

<comment>It can be confusing if you are taking a cold clinical view of the issues instead of actively trying to address the problem of racism against minorities. A good rule of thumb to go by is that whatever is better for minorities is the correct opinion socially and politically. Any differences that reflect poorly on non Whites are because of racism and any that are good are in spite of it.</comment>

<comment>only if it doesn't cause loss and pain on others.</comment>

<comment>So the correct position is no affirmative action and no welfare, because both have been disastrous for minorities.</comment>

<comment>" good rule of thumb to go by is that whatever is better for minorities is the correct opinion socially and politically. "Are Jews the minority? How about Polish-Americans? How about left-handed people? Folks who are good at math?</comment>

<comment>You misread.  There are real differences in PERCEPTIONS attributable to race.</comment>

<comment>Yes. Race doesn't really exist. Those sickle-cells that exist only in black people, are just a social construct. White people telepahtically put them there. Because they are aracist</comment>

<comment>Sickle Cell isn't directly connected to skin color. It is a genetic adaptation that evolved in populations most affected by malaria as it provides some protection. Skin color, like other genetic traits, lies on a cline. In this case, the two traits simply overlap, much like other traits such as hair texture, nose shape, etc.</comment>

<comment>"Sickle Cell isn't directly connected to skin color."Well that's great because I wasn't talking about race, not skin color!Dismissed, h0mo!</comment>

<comment>How do you define race? </comment>

<comment>I hate to break it to you, but sickle cell anemia does NOT exist only in blacks.  In fact it exists pretty much anywhere that malaria was really prevalent for a long time.  From the CDC:  Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects millions of people throughout the world and is particularly common among those whose ancestors came from sub-Saharan Africa; Spanish-speaking regions in the Western Hemisphere (South America, the Caribbean, and Central America); Saudi Arabia; India; and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey, Greece, and Italy.</comment>

<comment>OK, I accept that, but, is the United States is a place where malaria is really prevalent for a long time? From the same source:SCD occurs among about 1 out of every 500 Black or African-American births.SCD occurs among about 1 out of every 36,000 Hispanic-American births.And since Race is just a construct, genetics must have nothing to do with the above discrepancy, right? And I'm sure that while SCD is related to malaria, even though the US isn't prone to malaria, genetics can't have much to do with SCD and the discrepancy between races. Malaria must be a social construct, too.While we're at it, race-specific bio weapons must also be a fraud, because race is just a social construct. It must be impossible to kill one race of people with a weapon but not another. I just can't process this.</comment>

<comment>Ok, so clearly you have zero understanding of how genetic inheritance works.  You are a mixture of the genes that your very distant ancestors had.  So if you have one (or more) that were from a region where malaria was endemic, then you are likely to have the sickle cell gene even if those ancestors were many many many generations ago.  In other words, simply because you or your great grandparents or even great great great grandparents moved here to the USA from an area were malaria was endemic, the genes don't magically disappear.  And you'll recall that ultimate we ALL came from Africa.NONE of us evolved here in the USA.  We're all descendents of people who were on other continents.  You DO realize that, right?"While we're at it, race-specific bio weapons must also be a fraud, because race is just a social construct. It must be impossible to kill one race of people with a weapon but not another. I just can't process this."Now you've GOT to be either joking, or trolling - or you are really grossly ignorant.  "Race specific bioweapons" don't and can't exist - they're a fantasy, and a really poor one at that.  Some day it MIGHT be possible to target a very narrow specific DNA sequence - that could get certain specific individuals, but not anything close to an entire race - and in fact such a weapon if spread worldwide would virtually certainly kills parts of the population from ALL races, not just one.</comment>

<comment>Blah blah, libbie arguing from antirealism, hallucinates words into magic vacuum, blah blah.Same old, stale filth.</comment>

<comment>WINNER!! CONGRATULATIONS on winning the "stupidest most irrational post of the day" award!!</comment>

<comment>"So if you have one (or more) that were from a region where malaria was endemic, then you are likely to have the sickle cell gene even if those ancestors were many many many generations ago."Likely?  Even if the incidence of the gene in those areas was 100% -- it isn't -- you would have a fifty percent chance of its falling out with each generation.  A great-grandchild would have only a one in eight chance.  A great-great-great-grandchild, one in sixty-four.  A great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandchild, one in 512.</comment>

<comment>The person I was responding to was acting as if the genes would drop out of the population entirely in only a generation or two - and also was apparently unaware that there was a longstanding history of malaria in the USA in the past too.And of course in your comment, you are assuming only ONE ancestor, when in those areas, over time, it's far more likely to have been introduced time and again.  That's why the incidence of the gene remained pretty stable in those regions over very long time periods, because there was a major adaptive advantage to being heterozygous for the gene - and even a slight advantage to being homozygous for the gene compared to not having it at all.  Those who did NOT have the gene at all weren't nearly so likely to manage to reproduce to be your ancestor as those who were heterozygous for the gene, or even those who were homozygous for it.  Which is why in high malaria areas up to 40% of the population may carry the gene.  Any gene that prevalent typically takes a VERY long time to disappear out of a population even when it's selective advantage disappears.  In fact it may never be totally eliminated.</comment>

<comment>Oh, and yes, widespread parts of the USA used to have real problems with malaria.  In fact it was quite widespread as late as the 1880's.  After that it was a big problem primarily in the south and swampy areas such as where D.C. now exists.  We were able to eradicate it with widespread use of pesticides - specifically DDT - to kill mosquitoes in those areas regularly and to keep people from being infected by spraying the insides of homes and use of other methods to eliminate the mosquitoes and break the parasite lifecycle that causes malaria.  See: http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/abo... and:  http://www.cdc.gov/malaria/abo...</comment>

<comment>Everything's racist except thinking blacks too stupid to get photo IDs.</comment>

<comment>A good starting point would probably be to clearly distinguish between racism and disparate impact.  That can make the discussion less personal; people can feel less attacked for racism and instead it can be pointed out to them how policies of which they are unaware negatively impact another group. By making this distinction you also don't de-value the experiences and viewpoints of non-victim groups - instead you are trying to educate them.One problem with microaggressions is there is no logical stopping point. We can't know everything about every possible victim group, to never inadvertently appropriate any part of any culture in ways a member doesn’t like, or misunderstand something, or make an innocent remark that might offend. So this sets off a race to become the ever more-aggrieved victim group to protect one from sanctions.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me but that statement about microaggressions is DENYING the LEGITIMATE rage of all LGBTs and people of color. You don't get to talk that way because it's bigoted and I'm going to tell the moderator about this</comment>

<comment>LOL.</comment>

<comment>Now you're talking!REAL aggression for you...none of the microaggression stuff.</comment>

<comment>So let's throw the baby out with the bathwater. Sorry, but your post is an example of the most appalling form of racist rhetoric. </comment>

<comment>If that's the most appalling racist rhetoric you've ever heard then you have truly lived a sheltered existence.</comment>

<comment>I've personally heard worse and I'm sure most of us have, but his post does have a salient point; when we shrug off micro aggressions as if they don't exist, we are in fact creating the conditions for disparate impact to grow like a cancer. I'd agree that post was an example of problematic, even racist, rhetoric.</comment>

<comment>Disparate statistics can be grossly misleading.  For a better understanding of why, here is a good start for you:Holder Frames Ferguson PD For Racism Using Bogus 'Disparate Impact' Stats</comment>

<comment>This person's mind is in the right place, but he's just got it backwards. Colorblindness is good for whites because it prevents white people from organizing as a race. We've got black groups. We've got Hispanic groups. Asian groups. Jewish groups.But no white groups! Because they're 'color blind!'That makes it so easy to bully white people. Push them around without them even fighting back, because they don't want to even admit it's happening.Color blindness is a great way to make white people a minority. And I think we can ALL agree this is a GOOD thing.</comment>

<comment>I think we are on the same side but I don’t think colorblindness is enough for whites. They need to be actively pro non White first and for most.</comment>

<comment>I think all reasonable people can agree that straight white males are the enemy of a peaceful, progressive planet. Any time we enable POCs, LGBTs, and otherkin to attain positions of power we are also preventing straight white males from.occupying those positions. So I like to think of this coalition of sometimes competing groups as a unifying force for progress.I'm not yet advocating the physical removal of straight white males from society, as I think that same result can be accomplished politically. But should we fail in that regard I would condone it for the good of all people. </comment>

<comment>"I think all reasonable people can agree that straight white males are the enemy of a peaceful, progressive planet."No.  You're doing exactly the thing you condemn them for, you prejudiced hypocrite..</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure I'd single white males out so specifically, but it's hard to deny that white males are mostly responsible for slavery, colonization, racism, bigotry, and inequality in income and quality of life for the groups he mentioned. To say that applies to every single white male, of course, is just not true. But it's not an exaggeration to say that it applies to the majority. Roughly 65% of white males will vote for the GOP in each election cycle.</comment>

<comment>It's also hard for white males to support a party which increasingly paints them as a villain.  Voting Democrat as a white male is a masochistic endeavor at this point.  Look at all these left-wing commenters vilifying white males and salivating over some possibility of revenge for things many of us had nothing to do with.  It's not enough for white males to oppose racism in every form now.  Just being white and male makes you the enemy.</comment>

<comment>You're failing to acknowledge the proven fact that the suffering of previous generations gets passed down to the their modern day descendants genetically, which is why people of color continue to perform poorly academically and are vastly over represented in our criminal justice system. Many minority Americans are born with a kind of pseudo-PTSD. If they're forced to carry this burden through no fault of their own, is it too much to ask white males to take at least some responsibility for their own ancestors behavior??</comment>

<comment>I'm failing to acknowledge inheritable racial PTSD because I've never seen it proven as a fact.  Could you point me to the study?And yes, it is too much to ask for ANYONE of any race to be responsible for their ancestors' behavior.  That is a never-ending blame game as all people at all points in history have wronged other people in some way.  That is the nature of our human existence.</comment>

<comment>Even though the burden of proof should fall on white males to disprove its existence, the fact that African Americans consistently perform below their white oppressors on the ACT, SAT and IQ tests is enough evidence to confirm its existence. But I'm sure you're wanting the hard science version. Scientists have imaged microbiom profiles of black males and cross referenced those profiles with DNA samples of exhumed slaves and what they found astonished them; brain scan tomography actually showed certain parts of the brain were "lit up" when testing descendants of slaves, while those of non-slave descendants showed normal patterns. Almost all slave descendants were born with at least some signs of hypofrontality and the accumulation of DeltaFosB in their cerebellums, despite suffering no trauma in the everyday meat world. It really is astonishing. It's almost like something out of a David Cronenberg film.</comment>

<comment>[citation needed][citation needed][citation needed]</comment>

<comment>The burden of proof should be on you because you made it central to your argument that whites (I see we're calling them oppressors now) must atone for their ancestors' transgressions.  What you provided sounds interesting, and I will be researching it further, but I can't make the determination right now whether such tomography differences can conclusively be linked to the experience of slavery.That being said let's talk about fairness, because that is what is central to all of this.  To me, retribution is not fairness.  Equality is fairness.  I am in no way threatened by or resistant to full equality for everyone of every race, creed, religion, etc.  I think it makes us better as a society and there are so many things we could be doing to make that a reality right now.  I think the political messaging is wrong, and even worse the most effective messaging is being dismissed as racist.  That is to say, that the path of least resistance to full integration and equality is economic empowerment of a meritocratic nature rather than a redistributive nature.  "Perfect is the enemy of good enough" is a very apt sentiment here.We have to recognize that the most palatable message to affect real change must not be threatening to white people who still hold the political reigns.  I'm sure it doesn't appeal to your sense of justice but pragmatism is the order of the day.  Focus on creating an environment, especially for young folks, that is truly equal.  Provide every child of every race and background the same quality education, extracurricular enrichment, and job opportunities.  This will be tremendously expensive but you will find that appeals to equality of opportunity rather than forced equality of outcome yield the most political results.  This is where the GOP falls flat on its face trying to articulate the issue with words like 'divisive'.  They have their own messaging issues.</comment>

<comment>I've already answered you in detail; that you can shrug off such information just proves that you'll go to any length to maintain this white supremacist culture.You know as well as I do that when we provide an "even playing field" that people of color regularly get left behind. Rather than search for a legitimate explanation to that disparity, you're happy to let the result stand (and likely feel a kind of smug satisfaction at it, too). Personally, I have a conscience, so I actually worry about social justice and try to find answers.</comment>

<comment>Clearly I misjudged you as someone who wanted to engage in respectful conversation.  I thoughtfully addressed your point and said I WOULD LOOK INTO IT FURTHER.  The playing field is NOT level and I have searched for the legitimate explanation and the most effective means of addressing it.  It's wealth disparity.  I'm seeking real results and provided realistic means to do that.  And for you to utter the words 'smug satisfaction' is unbelievable irony.  Bye now.</comment>

<comment>And those irish -- same persecution!  Their ACT scores must suck by your measure!Fail!</comment>

<comment>Circular logic.why not just say that "the fact that African Americans consistently appear darker than their white oppressors on the melanin tests is enough evidence to confirm its existence"?No difference is proof of it until you can prove it wouldn't have existed without it.</comment>

But let's play...a white Russian immigrant who escaped true Soviet oppression must take responsibility for the less than 5% of whites in 1860 that owned slaves?  Or more personal...I am responsible for the sins of my grandfather?  Put down your social justice...see the world as it is...filled with unique individuals who are only responsible for their own actions.  Not groups subject to your prejudice and bigotry.</comment>

<comment>That's so ignorant of history it's laughable. Slavery existed 10,000 years before the U.S. came into being. White men didn't invent it-- they invented abolition and free markets and electricity and air conditioning and the most prosperous country-- with more concern for the rights of minorities-- in history, not to mention about a thousand other things that have improved the lot of the average human more than any statist, collectivist ideology ever dreamed of doing.I think, instead of all the cliched academic indoctrination and finger-pointing, the word you're looking for is "thanks".</comment>

<comment>First there needs to be a treatment for the laughable levels of indoctrination of self-hating whites like you.</comment>

<comment>WINNER!! CONGRATULATIONS on winning the "stupidest most insipid post of the day" award!!</comment>

<comment>You're all too happy to be critical of my ideas, but I don't see you offering an alternative. How would YOU solve the straight white male problem? What's YOUR solution to the last stumbling block to progress??</comment>

<comment>I would point out the massive racism, mind-numbing ignorance of history and human nature and blatant hypocrisy of claiming there's a "straight white male" problem in the first place.News flash: there has been more actual PROGRESS-- scientific, medical and technological-- over the past 200 years than came in the previous 10,000 THANKS primarily to straight white males. This is what developed the technology and means for you to sit safely in your mom's basement spewing indoctrinated anti-white pablum while people are being beheaded, crucified and driven into Europe by the hundreds of thousands in the middle-east and Africa-- the pure, non-white "utopias" where those "eeeevil white males" hold no sway.I think the word you're looking for is "thanks".</comment>

<comment>First of all, there is no need for personal attacks. I've refrained from pointing out your obvious flaws and racism, so I'd appreciate the same courtesy. Nearly the whole industrial revolution was made possibly only through the exploitation of people of color. You're happy to enjoy the benefits but want to ignore the brutal conditions it took to create the modern world. </comment>

<comment>Spare me the "civility" lecture after all the fashionably-racist bloviating about the "straight white male problem" obstructing "progress".</comment>

<comment>I can tell it bothers you that people like me are out there who will never stop fighting for justice. I bet it bothers you even more that demographic change is going to cause straight white Xtian males to become an irrelevant,  despised minority.  </comment>

<comment>There is no "straight white male problem."  Nor are they "the last stumbling block to progress."  Such claims are beyond absurd, and are either outright trolling, or a grossly twisted world view that ignores reality and history.  In fact "straight white males" are responsible for massive advances in society and technology, pulling huge numbers out of abject poverty, etc.So any way you cut it, you've got some real mental issues.</comment>

<comment>As deranged as all these whitey-blaming, hopelessly indoctrinated prog-Nazi's are, at least they're finally starting to let their masks slip and admitting their mindless race-hatred instead of hiding behind politically-correct "progressive" code-words. That's "progress"!</comment>

<comment>I can't tell if you're a real troll, or just trolling us with with Poe's Law and massive sarcasm that sounds all too real... I see from your profile you've got 6,410 comments, and a miniscule 1,910 up votes - so either way, you're doing a find job of trolling.And for those unfamiliar with Poe's law:  To borrow from the notoriously-inaccurate-but-oh-so-convenient Wikipedia:  Poe's law, named after its author Nathan Poe, is an Internet adage reflecting the idea that without a clear indication of the author's intent, it is difficult or impossible to tell the difference between an expression of sincere extremism and a parody of extremism.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P...</comment>

<comment>R, feministsafezone is a prolific, well known troll. You'll eventually need a hazmat suit to keep from getting an infection. :)</comment>

<comment>Thanks Peter!</comment>

<comment>yes, once it's real nuttiness begins it will tell you it's reporting you to "Disqus Security"  LOL  seriously. like a disqus guard on a segway is gonna come rollin' in and throw you out.https://youtu.be/HKieGUH9pzg</comment>

<comment>I am reporting you to Disqus security for being a troll........ https://youtu.be/HKieGUH9pzg</comment>

<comment>Ugh. You're the same jerk that banned me over on COTR. Very funny</comment>

<comment>i cannot ban anyone. You're a moron, you get yourself banned.</comment>

<comment>Yeah nice try Saul Alinsky. YOU need to be shut down due to incorrect opinions</comment>

<comment>yawn..............</comment>

<comment>I love it when you fascists slip and tell the truth about yourselves -- "incorrect opinions"? Now that's funny!</comment>

<comment>Whenever someone claims "colorblindness"  I think of Stephen Colbert stating "I don't see race"  and I laugh.  His tone is always so perfect in showing the ridiculousness of the idea.  The article hits on two points I think are most important in this debate which is 1. Sociologically we DO see race and cannot avoid it.  2.  Someone who says they don't see race can't see racism.I see the attractiveness of the idea of colorblindness.  It sounds great.  It's just not reality.  It's not reality on the macro level of society and it isn't reality on a micro level of any individual either.</comment>

<comment>Did you know that of 17 writers on Stephen Colbert's staff, exactly two identify as women and that zero identify as black bodies? I agree that Stephen Colbert is hilarious, but that is extremely problematic. I mean come on. It is 2015.</comment>

<comment>But Race doesn't exist. You just wrote that in another post. So there are no such thing as "Black bodies"</comment>

<comment>Race doesn't exist. it's a social construct made by white people. But, in order to fight back, black people and other progresives need to group and organize by race. So; one rule for me, another rule for thee. That's the progressive way!</comment>

<comment>Yes, and we're so powerful that you can identify a race 80% of the time given nothing but the bones of the person.</comment>

<comment>Your chosen username is problematic in that you apparently identify with a category known for its oppression of the less fortunate. Had you chosen, for instance,  DenisetheDindu, it would be acceptable becuase you'd be self-identifying with a category known for being oppressed, thus at least offering token support. </comment>

<comment>You are the perfect example of the pernicious effects of so-called color-blindness. You aren't even aware of the obvious racism when 17 people who think they are white successfully write a comedic program without any input at all from black bodies!</comment>

<comment>"Did you know that of 17 writers on Stephen Colbert's staff, exactly two identify as women and that zero identify as black bodies"Okay, laughed at this one.</comment>

<comment>"Identify as black bodies"?  You're making my ears hurt.</comment>

<comment>Do people self-identify as bodies now? Eeek.</comment>

<comment>Thanks.  I will boycott this show.  He is obviously WS.</comment>

<comment>I think racial awareness is just so important. The Republican Party would have us pretend that race is not important so that they could entrench the current distribution of power and resources. But we must constantly attack these edifices of White Supremacy and redistribute that ill-gotten power and those unearned resources more equitably. Racial awareness really keeps us from being lulled into a false sense of comfortable complacency. When what we really need is righteous racial anger so that we can really make the world a much better and happier place.</comment>

<comment>Race doesn't exist, How can "Whites" entrench themselves in any system? How can there be "White Supremacy" if Race doesn't exist?</comment>

<comment>Don't you have any empathy?</comment>

<comment>I'm asking a question. Answer the question.</comment>

<comment>As Feminist Liberals, we're the ones that ask the questions...</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  Now the riffraff are revolting and demanding that right for themselves.</comment>

<comment>People who want empathy do not try to get it in intellectual discussions.People who have empathy do not attempt to derail intellectual discussions with argumentum ad misericordiam because that's unpleasant.</comment>

<comment>He is a racist  hater.  Best to leave him alone.  He's not out to be educated, he is out to piss you off with his hate and ignorance.</comment>

<comment>blah blah blah</comment>

<comment>What you need is to put the bong down, get a real job and get off your whitey-blaming, fashionably-racist, laughably-indoctrinated high-horse.</comment>

<comment>Define "equitably". Who will decide which "resources" are "unearned" and how will they "redistribute" them "equitably"? I bet you have never really thought about this in detail.</comment>

<comment>I fully agree that colorblindness is counterproductive. When progressives refuse to look at race, they ignore the fact that some races are less intelligent, productive, hardworking, and conscientious than other races. Colorblindness is close minded bigotry and anti-science.</comment>

<comment>Race is just a social construct. It's not even real.</comment>

<comment>Then why does Affirmative Action and "minority" quota systems still exist?</comment>

<comment>Wow... just wow. Why are you racists always trying to attack policies of racial amelioration? Those policies exist because there are just so many educated and qualified minorities who are not getting jobs because of racism. White people really need to stop stealing all of the good jobs for themselves.It's because of behavior like this that one day white people will be an unpopular minority in this country. All of that wealth ill-earned by White Supremacy will be redistributed so that we can have universal bilingual pre-K and improved infrastructure that creates good green jobs that keep our minority populations out of prison and away from drugs and malt-liquor.</comment>

<comment>We need to have quota systems because white people created the construct of race and are enforcing it. That's why we need a double standard: Non-whites can talk about race. White people can't. It's only when we apply double standards that we can finally have fairness in society.</comment>

<comment>Its a very common cycle through out history. Non whites create jobs and wealth which whites go on to steal. Thats why justice has to come before color blindness.</comment>

<comment>Lunatic fashionably-racist drivel.</comment>

<comment>Wow. Just wow. Talk about avoiding/inverting the answer to the question. And THANK bunches for PROVING "anti Racist" is simply code for White genocide!</comment>

<comment>Tell me about Rhodesia, and Detroit, MI. The Rise and Fall.</comment>

<comment>I don't know -- maybe because you don't ameliorate anything -- indeed being cold and heartless, you are actively aggravating the problem?</comment>

<comment>"All of that wealth ill-earned by White Supremacy will be redistributed..."Do you want to take property from all white people, or only some of them?</comment>

<comment>You certainly have received some bizarre replies to this post so far.  Hard to tell which are genuine and which are sarcasm.  The ones which are sarcasm have been flawlessly executed though.</comment>

<comment>Yes. And those sickle-shaped red blood cells that show up only in black people are also social constructs.</comment>

<comment>No, race is NOT just a social construct.</comment>

<comment>^ Reported for Racism</comment>

<comment>So how do you decide who is an oppressed racial minority? All people are the same, right?</comment>

<comment>You seem to really believe in it. I mean advocating and reveling in the loss of a white majority while claiming race is just a social construct seems to suggest you might be a hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>The only race that is demonstrably less hard working and intelligent though is Whites. Thats why they have had to rely on non white slave labor and imperialism for survival. Whiteness needs to be identified and rooted out wherever it rears its ugly head.</comment>

<comment>What about the technology that you're using to spew this tripe? Who invented it?</comment>

<comment>Slavery existed for thousands of years.</comment>

<comment>The same arguments were made regarding the Irish, Italian, Polish, German, Jewish, etc. immigrant groups in the past all of whom were regarded as different "races" in American history at one time. Nothing new...</comment>

<comment>White people will soon be an unpopular minority in this country. They can vote their self-interest, but that won't stop their ill-gotten wealth earned under a system of White Supremacy from being redistributed to deserving minorities.</comment>
