<comment>You can either spew insults or credibly promote a scandal story. Choose.Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, to their credit, hold foreign policy views that reflect their beliefs, and are not feigned for electoral advantage. Few people vote on the basis of international relations. Sanders probably gets a marginal lift among such voters in the Democratic primary electorate. Should she get the nomination, her relatively Hawkish orientation will help Clinton in the general election.Props to Bernie for making the right call in 2002, but the lessons of that decision do not make every projection of American strength morally and strategically wrong.</comment>

<comment>But the voices. The shouty voices.  In his head.  They shout at him.  So hard to focus on one topic.</comment>

<comment>I'll give lost in the stars credit for at least speaking civilly and proffering genuine arguments. Quixote, you seem more like an uneducated leech on others comments, and you subtly erode their credibility. Best to just stop commenting if you want to advance your position.</comment>

<comment>LOL. 1)Its Disqus. Not Hewlett Packard.  There's no 'advancement'.  Its like the Star Wars Cantina.2)He's one of the indigenous shouty nutjobs.  He's a troll.  If he wishes to engage in a civil fashion, I'm quite happy to engage in a civil fashion.3)I'm not subtly eroding his credibility.  He doesn't have any and I'm very explicitly saying he's a crazy person.  Its as subtle as two-by-four.4)There is a very short list of people whose opinions I value.  You are still not on it.</comment>

<comment>It is the propensity to initiate military action as a first, rather than last resort, that is indefinitely morally and strategically wrong.Most of our soldiers in uniform fight for the right reason. The politicians who put those men and women in harm's way for a political agenda are corrupt and ideological.</comment>

<comment>Aye, there's the rub with Hillary. Not only is AIPAC, AEI, and Israel proper so far up her (she should be incorporating Yiddish into her stilted and convenient accents).  Add to that Clinton Foundation donations and the war business is Hill's alone.</comment>

<comment>"Props to Bernie for making the right call in 2002, but the lessons of that decision do not make every projection of American strength morally and strategically wrong." That's a straw man. Nobody is saying that the US should never use force abroad.That said, let's look at the major interventions undertaken after the disastrous Iraq War. Hillary has supported all of them: the Afghanistan escalation, the intervention in Libya, the drone war, and support for Syrian rebels. Of course she now wants to establish a no-fly zone in Syria. Which one of these has made the US safer or the world a better place?</comment>

<comment>Gosh, I am totally convinced now!</comment>

<comment>Sanders and veterans may not seem like an obvious match, but they have been a constant in his career. When he rose to chair the Senate Veterans Committee in 2013, he noted that the first bill he ever introduced in Congress—in 1991—called for reimbursing members of the National Guard and Reserve for income they lost while deployed in the Persian Gulf War. Now veterans and the committee Sanders once led are touchstones for him as he runs for president.Read more: http://www.politico.com/magazi...</comment>

<comment>You do realize the vets all love him plus he CAN'T BE BOUGHT</comment>

<comment>Bernie has spent more outside money at this point in the campaign than Hillary Clinton.  He won't acknowledge his nurses PAC but that doesn't change the truth.  Bernie can say Hillary Clinton is bought or corrupted by money, but just because he says it, doesn't make it so!</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, but what are you smoking/drinking/popping? You honestly believe nurses provide more "outside money" than fossil fuel corporations, war profiteers, Big Pharma and Wall St? I can't stop laughing!</comment>

<comment>Total nonsense comment based on nonsense NYT article debunked by Robert Reich who has known Hillary since she was 19.</comment>

<comment>Except that that article you read in the Washington Post was wrong.                                                                                          https://theintercept.com/2016/...</comment>

<comment>Barring a major event, this election isn't going to be about foreign policy. The economy barely grew last quarter:http://www.bostonherald.com/ne...which means it's very likely we're at the start of a recession.  To have any chance, the Dems are probably better off with the guy who's been talking honestly about the awful Obama economy.</comment>

<comment>Idiot</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't throw words like idiot around so offhandedly. While the dig at Obama from the previous poster is clearly partisan, it is true that the real economy in terms of profit taking and depressed wages (albeit more employment) is resulting in stagflation.There is also a huge student debt balloon that is about to pop with speculation attached to that debt similar to the speculation surrounding the housing market before the 2008 crash. Also the economy has seemed to take center stage in great part because of the narrative successfully expressed by the Sanders campaign.</comment>

<comment>Stagflation certainly doesn't describe today's American economy. The term was popularized in the 1970s to capture a sluggish economy with high inflation, induced in part by the oil shocks of that decade.The related concept of the Misery Index adds the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. The Misery Index currently stands at a sixty year low, with unemployment at ~5% and inflation at ~1%. http://inflationdata.com/artic...</comment>

<comment>You are correct by definition but I think in terms of goods and services that most people buy, such as groceries and housing. They have continued to out pace the economy at large while average consumer purchasing power has decreased. I suppose it would be better to say an analog of stagflation looms unannounced.But I am interested in your opinion. What do you think of the state of the economy on Main Street? Do you think purchasing power of average citizens is set to rebound?</comment>

<comment>We've economically outperformed most of the developed world since 2008. We still do. But the global escalator is lately going down. Even if we walk up a couple of steps, the short-term trend isn't good.Factors such as globalization's challenge to the labor market, and the internet's ongoing assault on retail, create a dampening effect on confidence and the economy, which are linked. At the same time, both of these factors improve average people's standard of living by keeping prices down. Cheap energy giveth and taketh.Short answer: I dunno.</comment>

<comment>Where is that crystal ball when you need it. Anyway, thank you for indulging me. The good news is markets are up this week; let us hope it continues despite it all.</comment>

<comment>"So tell us Mr. Cruz/Trump/Rubio, what is your plan for revitalizing the economy?""Well, we'll have to experience some austerity to get the deficit down.  So I intend to fire about 3 million federal employees.  Also, tax cuts for the very wealthy, because reasons."And in bars across the land, middle class workers do a spit take.Of course, I haven't heard any concrete plans from the R's on this topic because they've been busy re-enacting Human Centipede in Congress, but this is the Ryan plan, so I'm assuming its what they'll run with.</comment>

<comment>Nearly all economic indicators have improved under our current President. Stop drinking the Kool-aid and start reading the news.</comment>

<comment>For the love of all that's holy, stop saying "drink the Kool-aid." It's condescending. What's more, it belies your intelligence because it reveals an ironic xenophobia towards new ideas. Makes me crazier than hearing a corporate hack overuse the word "robust," sigh...</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders has consistently praised President Obama's economic and social policies. Most of his plans expand on the foundations currently being laid.On the other hand, Bernie has been very acute in his criticism of unfettered capitalism, crony capitalism, and the very negative consequences such entail.</comment>

<comment>My impression of Sanders' foreign policy position is "can we talk about domestic policy instead?"  It's fine if he's a non-interventionist but I haven't really seen anything put forth by him that I would describe as a real vision, and he couldn't be described as any sort of voice or thinker on these issues during his time in Congress.However, at the end of the day I don't think foreign policy really matters that much in the primary, and he's probably wise not to engage Clinton on that since no matter how you view her track record she can claim a level of experience he cannot hope to match.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>I don't view "experience" as an advantage in and of itself.Specifically, what was the outcome of her time as Secretary of State? It seems to me that Kerry, in the relatively short time that he has been SoS, has achieved much more. So Clinton might have more experience, but I would hardly call that experience a very positive one. Our soft power, which is what I consider State to be cultivator of, was not exactly at a peak at the end of her term.</comment>

<comment>It's absurd. Can you imagine an MLB player who managed to spend a year in the majors, get a .125 batting average, and then go around boasting about having "MLB experience"?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure it happens in bars near AAA fields all the time...</comment>

<comment>That would be a perfectly reasonable way to differentiate yourself from a group of people who never even made it onto their high school team JV team..</comment>

<comment>Except that Hillary made the team by marrying the team captain.</comment>

<comment>But not from a group of people who knew better than go to bat in a game you didn't belong in.</comment>

<comment>I don't disagree with your first sentence, but the rest is off because I don't think Clinton or Kerry have been major influences on this Administration's foreign policy.  It has largely been dictated to them and then they carry it out.</comment>

<comment>Even if that were true, it doesn't exactly make Clinton's time as SoS look any better. It sounds more like an excuse.ETA: So I respond with a question: How well did she do at implementation? Libya is a mess. Egypt is better, but not because of us - we supported the protesters, and then couldn't prevent the Muslim Brotherhood from gaining power.</comment>

<comment>from another perspective, Libya is a whole lot better than Syria. Food for thought.As far as Egypt, we have a long track record of supporting democracy (for good reason though the exact parameters of our approach are really flawed). Democracy picked the Muslim Brotherhood in what was, by most all accounts, a fair and free election. That is a policy disconnect that we are eventually going to have to confront.</comment>

<comment>"we have a long track record of supporting democracy..."Hahahahahaha! Good one. NOW GET ME SOME CHIQUITA'S!</comment>

<comment>No, quite the opposite; we have a long track record of NOT supporting democracy around the world. What the US does is bully/bribe countries to support our foreign policy. Woe be to them if they don't comply. Governments we have toppled recently: Ukraine, Egypt, libya. Also, our meddling is now the cause of a constitutional crisis in Haiti as the Haitians have risen up to protest against the candidate we are trying to force down their throats. A por US business interests, of course.                                                                                                             Yeah, great foreign policy. By all means, go for the Establishment candidate.</comment>

<comment>If I may say, I think you are letting your prejudices override logic.  One of the roles of SecState is negotiating with heads of state.  They can't do the car salesman "Let me ask my manager" tactic when they are negotiating with a Chinese or German official or head of state.  The president has to trust his SecState to do the best they can.</comment>

<comment>You can't have it both ways. Either Clinton gets credit for what happened in her time (which you supported by giving her credit for her "experience") or she doesn't because it was Obama's decisions (which you support when it is brought up that the outcomes of her time were unfavorable). Not both.</comment>

<comment>It's funny though how much foreign policy seems to matter to the Repubs. Wars of Choice and stances on the Surveillance State matter a lot to this Dem.</comment>

<comment>He is a logical man that realizes we can't keep being the United kingdom of the world and spend more than half our total budget on defense.</comment>

<comment>Judgement over experience.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Clinton's experience only serves as a testament to her extremely poor judgement.</comment>

<comment>Sanders' foreign policy vision is proven right in front of you, in the article you are commenting on. He didn't just say "War, bad. Peace, good." He laid out specific concerns that all proved to be substantial. Meanwhile, Clinton has continued her hawkish ways.</comment>

<comment>He suggested that Iran and Saudi Arabia should form a coalition to fight ISIS. That the suggestion is both terribly unrealistic and hugely undesirable if it were to happen is just a metaphor for the whole Sanders agenda. He proposes things that defy possibility, and that aren't necessarily fully thought through. Then his supporters laud him as a messiah and call you a shill when you question them.</comment>

<comment>She has experience in invading other countries and getting people killed, yes. He has experience in having forethought. Clinton is a war monger.</comment>

<comment>Bernie probably has instincts that fit better with Democrats on foreign policy. But he also has a lot less knowledge, and shown little inclination to bone up on that knowledge.</comment>

<comment>An absurd assertion, to be sure.I contend that his knowledge of foreign policy is not only superior to his colleagues but that his judgment is unswayed by $pecial interest$.http://www.dailykos.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>Less knowledge? I don't think so. If you actually listen to Clinton talk about foreign policy, she sounds sort of confused.</comment>

<comment>Iran. Saudi Arabia. Coalition to fight ISIS. Anybody who suggests that is a workable or desirable policy is not knowledgeable about foreign policy.</comment>

<comment>If he has less knowledge, how did he call the results of the Iraq war correctly while Clinton was completely wrong?</comment>

<comment>Maybe because he doesn't have superior foreign-policy judgment. Just because you make stupid assumptions in your headline doesn't make them true.</comment>

<comment>It's not an assumption, it's an assertion. (BTW, look at the URL for this article: "Why Isn't Hillary's Hawkishness A Dealbreaker". I'm guessing the editors changed his title.)Friedersdorf concludes that if you like a good "war of choice" go with HRC. Me, I marched against the Iraq War and it's clear as day to me that a majority of the crap we're dealing with today is the result of Dubya/Cheney's invasion of Iraq.</comment>

<comment>The Iraq invasion certainly exacerbated the situation. But this was a long time coming, long before 9/11</comment>

<comment>Well, I didn't define my terms very precisely. Clearly there was conflict in the Middle East before 9/11. But the US invasion destabilized the area in a very major way and precipitated a LOT of change. Created fabulous new terrorist threats.I'm not going to attempt an airtight case, but: the rise of ISIS, the shape of the modern Surveillance State, even part of the Great Recession (Iraq War's $3T debt--which ironically led to the creation of the Tea Party, as well as various disastrous austerity programs) all have roots in the Bush administration's decision to invade.</comment>

<comment>The Middle East is waging a war of ideology, a war they have waged for eons. We are only there for the oil, and the benefit of the Military industrial Complex. Lets put that money into our economy by reducing our dependency on oil, and solving global warming.</comment>

<comment>I'm not a tea party fan, but you are not comparing them to ISIS or the modern surveillance state right?Great recession was definitely a consequence of Iraq (you could say Iraq and Afghanistan together). Ramp up the amount of debt while creating massive amounts of uncertainty, and watch confidence crash.</comment>

<comment>Of course I'm not equating the two. But I am referring to the TP as a part of "the crap we're dealing with today".</comment>

<comment>I agree with Conor. I've been saying this is one of the big reasons people should vote for Sanders. The other being that he gives every indication that he is for reigning in domestic surveillance, while Clinton gives every indication that she would follow in Obama's footsteps and extend it.  I hope Conor brings this up in another article.</comment>

<comment>I will echo what others have said.  I think Bernie has better instincts than HRC, since she's trapped in an outdated "Puppy up a tree in East Buttcrackistan?  Lets deploy a battalion of marines!" mode of thinking.  But after four years as SecState, she does know the major players and scenarios WAY better than Sanders.  Voters won't be able to discriminate the difference between isolationism and interventionism, but they'll recognize a moment like "I'm sorry Senator Sanders, did you mean the Prime Minister of Leftoeslavia, Dragislov Krbnkz?"I do question why people keep saying "We'll never have single payer" without even mentioning its little brother, the public option.  After four or five years of actually looking at how ridiculously expensive health care is, and how FEW choices there are when you get down to specifics, voters might be more excited about being able to purchase access to basic medicare.  And if Rubio ends up as their nominee, he can't even sqawk.  Florida has allowed its residents to buy publicly owned homeowners insurance since 2002.  I don't know if Rubio ever voted for or against it, but at one time it was the states #1 insurer, and a number of people are still butthurt about how they were pushed off its rolls.  He can't oppose a public option for Obamacare when his home state has a public option.</comment>

<comment>You're dealing with people giving Clinton credit where it isn't due.It doesn't matter that Hillary's been around longer, what matters is what she DID while around.Sanders was one of the few who recognized Bush was a lying SOB and the Iraq War was a train wreck waiting to happen. But let's ignore that and vaguely refer to Clinton as more "Experienced".</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clintons experience in the State Department is considered to be an advantage. As if America's current foreign policy is something we should be proud of.</comment>

<comment>For me, Bernie smacks too much of an isolationist. Hillary has made mistakes, for sure. (though lets not act like 90%+ of the nation wasn't in favor of the Iraq invasion at the time. Different world.) But if my choices are "remain very engaged in the world" and "lets just worry about here" then I'm going to pick the former. Its easy to look at the world currently as a crazy inferno that resulted from US action/inaction. Its alot harder to imagine a world where the US wasn't involved at all. I tend to think things would be significantly worse. Not because we are exceptional or meant for it, but because we are the sovereign with the most money, power and influence.I realize Bernie isn't an isolationist, but unquestionably foreign policy isn't a priority of his. Apart from too much disengagement, I also worry that Bernie's stance will have him deferring too much to the military leadership (a leadership that always seems to get somewhat of a pass for the horrendous job it did in Iraq). </comment>

<comment>I would say that 90% of the media was eager to indulge in manufacturing consent for the war but the protests against this war were also the largest in US history. The weight of evidence presented by the Bush Administration consisted of cartoon depictions and hearsay (no joke, I'm serious). If one had an inkling of critical thinking skills they would come to the conclusion that there was no compelling reason to invade Iraq as she was economically and militarily isolated by the international community with stiff sanctions and no fly zones.I dare say you may have been convinced by the spectacle of it all, but not all of us were so dazzled into blind acquiescence. Certainly not me, Obama, Sanders, or the majority you claim.No, the blunder was hers to make and it reflects either her inability to distinguish fantasy and fact, or she was simply willing to see 100,000's dead in exchange for her political ambitions. Take you pick - stupidity or peer pressure. Neither scenario is particularly savory.</comment>

<comment>90% was an exaggeration, you're right. It was closer to 75% judging by Gallup and other sources.  I was 16 with conservative parents so my perspective was flawed, admittedly.Still, in this day and age, 75% of us agreeing on anything is quite remarkable. The country's blood was up.</comment>

<comment>Your admission of youthful naivety is respectable and it shows you are honest which is probably more important than anything.I must confess I still cannot believe the figures you present despite my seeing eyes. But then again I am a cynical old bastard with little regard for the sanity of the American political system. Depressingly it does not surprise. </comment>

<comment>You might indeed be right about the numbers.  One of the retrospective elements of the whole affair was that the media was far too accepting of Bush's arguments.  Powell himself has lamented that the intelligence apparatus wasn't more vocal discrediting the supposed intelligence being bandied about, but there's a woman named Valerie Plame who might be able to explain why that attitude existed.  Had we been more critical and applied more scrutiny to the intelligence, we might have stayed out of Iraq.</comment>

<comment>An isolationist? Do you not what the term means? An isolationist is somebody who wants to shut off America from the world. Restrict all manner of engagement. Bernie wants to limit military engagements and interventions which harm both our national interest and the world at large. He's (though not as much as I'd like) a non-interventionist. You say you realize he isn't an isolationist but that he "smacks" of one. I don't see how you get there at all. Opposing misguided wars of choice does not render one an isolationist.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, I still haven't recovered to Sen. Sander's answer when asked on Face the Nation how he'd address the ISIS threat two days after the Paris shooting/bombings. "I'd tackle global warming!"A stopped clock is exactly right twice a day.  However, that doesn't make it a reliable time piece.</comment>

<comment>I believe his point was a very cogent one: that if we weren't so dependent on fossil fuels, we wouldn't be, in effect, funding the extremists with our purchases of oil from the Mideast.</comment>

<comment>That wasn't his point. His point was that rising temperatures were causing people to act more crazy.</comment>

<comment>His point was the same point that the DoD and the Pentagon made. That Global Warning is the greatest threat to national security. As countries have to migrate populations due to crop failures from drought or due to sea level rises, conflict will be increased due to fighting over ever scarce resources. He is right. There are multiple studies which show the drought as a significant factor in the civil war in Syria. That drought caused rural citizens to come to the capital in search of help and that mass of people along with extremist factions become the overwhelming force of the rebels. The only mistake he made was using the word direct instead of indirect.</comment>

<comment>You guys can project as much as you like into the answer, it's still like complaining to the police about a string of burglaries in the neighborhood and having the police chief say "I have a plan. We're going to institute universal pre-K which will help kids succeed in school and life!"  As good an idea universal pre-K may be, that chief is going to need a different line of work soon.</comment>

<comment>That's not a very pertinent analogy.  The attacks on Paris (while tragic and a concerning indicator) do not directly impact the US; they are, literally, a European problem in that they're the ones getting burgled and the US is not.The US has tried a number of strategies in the region, none of which appear to work very well.  1.  We invaded and overthrew the government of Iraq (albeit incompetently, but there is little political will to ever do it right).  Left a mess.2. We provided military assistance to what appeared like a viable opposition in Libya to attempt to stave off a protracted conflict.  Still a mess.3. We largely ignored Syria for several years as it didn't directly impact our interests; the place is a mess.So yeah, since you're unlikely to fix the authoritarian governments who cannot deal with droughts and other likely impacts of climate change, I'd saying trying to make sure they don't have to (to the same degree) seems to be a pretty high priority since there are actual solutions we could be pursuing.If the Europeans want to send troops to fix the problems in Syria and Iraq, let them.</comment>

<comment>Then it'd have been better if he said  "Not our problem. Now global warming, there's a problem and here's what I'll do about it..."  That would have at least answered the question in a sensible way. Kinda.</comment>

<comment>I'm sympathetic to that. But unless we nationalize our oil production industry we will still have some sensitivity to the price of oil, which is heavily predicated on what's going on in that region.But in general, Bernie is not the best extemporaneous speaker I've ever seen either.</comment>

<comment>Lol touche....My point above was only that we should focus on prevention rather than intervention, planning rather than reacting.</comment>

<comment>And that's a valid position. If the question was "How would you prevent the rise of an ISIS like state again."  that would have been a plausible answer.  Also, if the remark had been off the cuff or on the day of the shooting, I'd have written it off as a mistake or being careless but two days later? Scary. (tho in fairness he did take a different tack later tho I'm not sure "Saudi Arabia has lots of planes! Let them take out ISIS!" is any better (even worse in some ways, as it shows NO understanding of middle east politics... *sigh*)</comment>

<comment>It isn't the climate change that's the problem, it's the weak, poorly administered authoritarian governments that can't cope with it that are the problem. The humanitarian crisis in Syria began before the droughts:http://www.tandfonline.com/doi...For related examples, see the Holodomorhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Or Spin's classic 1986 expose of why Live Aid was an utter failure http://www.spin.com/2015/07/li...Both are examples of governments willfully starving their citizens to death because they had other priorities. A planet full of advanced, stable democracies could handle all manner of climate changes without going to war. But that's not the planet we have. So ultimately, whether the planet warms, or another ice age begins, or some other disaster occurs, the threat to national security is not those problems, it's corrupt gangster states.</comment>

<comment>I'm so glad others pushed back against that drivel for me. I'll also add this:http://www.politifact.com/trut...</comment>

<comment>You folks ever check your facts? http://www.defense.gov/News-Ar...Climate change is _a_ serious security risk in that it exacerbates other problems, Not _the greatest_ threat (according to the DoD anyway).</comment>

<comment>This is true though. Syria's issues have a risen in parallel with record drought in the area.</comment>

<comment>Not really true.http://www.politifact.com/trut...</comment>

<comment>Even the Pentagon agree with Sanders that global warming is our biggest threat. But maybe you're not ready for an intelligent president who thinks critically and doesn't indulge in knee-jerk reactions or fear mongering to gain votes. Fortunately many of us are.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you're missing my point. Please see my reply to Shayne.Edit: The police chief analogy. it got buried down in the thread.</comment>

<comment>Oh and the Pentagon found that climate change is indeed a security risk but didn't declare it to be our "biggest threat". http://www.defense.gov/News-Ar...</comment>

<comment>What most people fail to understand about the emergence of civil war in Syria and subsequently ISIS:http://www.politifact.com/trut...It is not as if the eventual members of ISIS would not still have met up in the prisons of occupying Western forces, or that the Arab Spring would have not otherwise have happened (though much of the unemployment and inflation and poverty and repression that drove the Arab Spring was also very intricately related to demographics and the environment), but that this was a very easily observable causal relationship that even intelligent people either have not considered or refuse to believe because of propaganda. Drought happens. Than famine. People migrate for cities, with their more plentiful markets and resources. The cities become strained with the influx, devastation and desperation spread. We are talking about hundreds of thousands of people with very limited access to water. The desperation leads them to protest. Whether you accept the more optimal narrative of peaceful revolution or the Russian propaganda decrying US imperialism and terrorism, there is no debate about large groups of people being mobilized to protest because lack of alternative. Opportunity has always been limited in Syria, but the suddenness of this all overwhelmed the authorities, who mishandled the situation badly. From street violence to skirmishes to now global powers flying air sorties, the escalation from drought to famine to mass migration to political crisis to civil war to geopolitics has happened within a time span starting in just 2006. The extremism surprised us over in the heart of the empire, but that's only because we don't pay attention to what's going on and have always had easy access to the most basic tenet of life on Earth: water.I recall as a teen I visited Greece. We thought it ridiculous that all the restaurants charged money for water. What a naive fool I was...</comment>

<comment>The cause is not the issue, actually. The key question is: If we waved a magic Bernie wand and global warming was set back to it's pre-industrial state tomorrow, would that fix the problem of ISIS and lead to peace and prosperity in the middle east? If not, the Sanders answer to the question was a non-starter at best and scarily naïve at worst.As to my thoughts on the politifacts rating (not that it applies to my point (see above)). "Mostly true"?  I think the Politifact people are being a bit generous on that one.  What saves O'Malley there is his actual statement (vs what people read into it). "One of the things that preceded the failure of the nation-state of Syria and the rise of ISIS was the effect of climate change [yes effects preceded demonstrations and the civil war] and the mega-drought that affected that region [a much more direct linkage], wiped out farmers, drove people to cities, created a humanitarian crisis,"  For one thing the drought was 2006-2009, it's plausible global warming contributed to the drought and it's severity but to what degree is VERY hard to determine and it can NOT be said with any degree of certainty that climate change caused (triggered) the drought.Agree or disagree, you may find this interesting/helpful: Astronomy magazine's editor, David Eicher, had a good piece on the "gross misrepresentation of science" today http://www.astronomy.com/bonus...I'd put this claim firmly in the exaggeration camp. Just MHO of course.</comment>

<comment>I see your point about the language of the question and how the response doesn't address it head on. I tend to think in terms of prevention rather than intervention, but I run a restaurant. An employee leaves the sink on, we can turn it off and make efforts to see it doesn't happen again. Totally different story with ISIS. I agree they need to be dealt with, and the complexity of doing so requires our political leaders to open up their ideas to debate.I think you are thinking too much about the term climate change within a political context, that being global warming. The climate is always changing though, and to go from whatever level of rainfall naturally occurs to drought certainly represents a valid use of the definition. Is it attributable to humans? Well, humans are a driving force in a process that is increasing the intensity of climate effects, so the two can be linked. To what extent? I'm no scientist, but I see you found yourself one. Grudgingly, I'll have a look.Thank you for your insight.</comment>

<comment>This article appears to be suffering from the same symptom a lot of people on the left are suffering from which I'll call Iraq Evasion Syndrome.  It usually equates our terrible decisions in Iraq with *any* interventionist or even remotely aggressive foreign policy and concludes that any such action will be Iraq 2.0.  This is a completely false notion to anyone who has studied even a bit of history.  Aggression does not always end in catastrophe.  To be clear, I'm not advocating we run out and invade Syria, but the American left seems to be suffering from a hardy dose of head-in-sand isolationism right now.  Anything ugly or challenging (ISIS, Ukraine, etc.) they seem to want to ignore and hope it just goes away.I will vote for Sanders, but asserting that "dovishness is better because Iraq" is some serious tunnel vision.</comment>

<comment>No, but you could argue (and I believe that the article does) that Clinton has so far displayed worse judgement on the when and how to use aggressive foreign policy.</comment>

<comment>The point is Iraq + Libya + Syria == a pattern.Regime change is a false description of the collapse of a country into (un)civil war.  The opposite of war is not peace: the opposite of war is civilization. Sudden removal of an autocratic regime in a country that is not otherwise culturally or ethnically cohesive is extremely likely to lead to the worst sort of chaos - Yugoslavia after Tito is another example.Clinton's foreign policy experience is worthless because she refuses to learn the obvious results of 'regime change'.  Millions of refugees, huge setbacks for women and children across the ME and still she soldiers on.</comment>

<comment>Sanders wants regime change in Syria with Assad out.Libya was a NATO decision initiated by France and the UK. Facts matter.</comment>

<comment>Sanders wants ISIS over with locals in the lead and locals on the ground.  Transition away from Assad after.  At Russia's urging Assad actually agreed to a negotiated transfer of power but he won't budge while under attack from extremists started by US Iraq invasion (that vote again), sourced by Bush (Sunni Awakening) then continued Saudi/Qatari support while Clinton turned a blind eye. It is an uncomfortable fact that all Clinton's vaunted support for moderates ended up in the hands of ISIS. Her focus was exclusively Assad while the cancer of ISIS grew  and metastasized into a threat to two states and caused millions of refugees.Hillary shilled for the Libya intervention full throttle. The topic of the OP and my post is Hillary's judgement.  Even if NATO led US into there (not likely), Hillary gave more than the go ahead.  Other reports have said Obama was a bit leery - Hillary not so much:  "we came, we saw, he died"  - empire much?More refugees ensue.  ISIS appears on another continent.Millions of women and children suffer.Sticky facts about Clinton's experience.</comment>

<comment>You probably are too big a shrill ("extremists started by US Iraq invasion") to have known that Assad actively recruited extremists from Iraq and facilitated their suicide attacks against occupying Americans and Europeans.Just to be clear about historical facts, those extremists did not start with the US invasion of Iraq. Many of those extremists prior to joining terrorist groups worked for the Iraqi deep state, and they attempted to assassinate a US president, experimented with weapons programs of mass destruction, and attacked several of their sovereign neighbors. Many of course were also just terrorists prior, whether in Chechnya, Afghanistan, the Levant or the Maghreb.Disclosure I was against the Iraq War and am aware the consequences have been immense destruction and despair, but I don't subscribe to the naive belief that Clinton, Bush, and Obama deserve more responsibility for the advent of terrorism than Assad and Gaddafi and Saddam do. There is plenty of research demonstrating how in the absence of an open and civil society (in other words, a dictatorship), the Mosque became the only outlet for any expression. Unfortunately some very bad people (bin Laden, Omar Mullah, Baghdadi), who by the way arguably deserve even more responsibility than the Saddam, Gaddafis, and Assads, hijacked the religion for their own political purposes.Nothing happens in a vacuum. We need more context in today's information overload world. Every event, interaction, movement, etc happens within limits determined by the preexisting conditions, of which are the results of those highest socioeconomic and political forces. The latter is especially exemplified in leadership, which this world seems to be severely lacking in. Only once we remove the head do we start to see the grotesque consumption of what brutality and oppression imply.</comment>

<comment>Of course the extremism didn't start with the US invasion. The Iraqi/Syrian extremists were freed by the US invasion, instigated by US Ambassador John Negroponte's application of "the Salvadoran option", fostered by the US in the Sunni Awakening and funded all the way into Syria by the Saudi deep state (Bandar Bush, et. al.).  Your sophistry is appalling.</comment>

<comment>If by "freed" you mean they moved from more of an underground network of criminals and corrupt officials to a more overt insurgency and eventually terrorist state, then I'd have to say agreed.That was an unintended consequence for most people involved in the war. For those who had an agenda and stood to benefit, as I said and I repeat again: they were taking advantage of preexisting conditions.Accountability is important. I would throw people like Negroponte, Bandar, and the lot of them in front of a tribunal at the Hague and let justice be done. You meanwhile seem content to leave Assad with his crown, or just until ISIS is defeated right?What conspiracy theorists like you fail to understand is that when the administration announces a policy like "Assad must go", they are not stating an intention to topple him, though admittedly it appears an attempt has been made to do so through some nefarious elements of our deep state. The statement is simply an assertion, based on logic and moral principle, that so long as Assad rules, people will be willing to support ISIS or other rebel groups, precisely because they hate Assad (namely for the war crimes and collateral damage his regime is responsible for).You want to blame the USA? Fine. You are entitled to your ignorant opinion. It is no small wonder to those of us who follow global affairs and are students of history, that the civil war is happening in Syria and not the USA. Here we are rich and we are free. No reason to rebel. Syria has long been a different story, under the thumb (or fist?) of a tyrant who relies solely on his relationship with a foreign power to maintain control. Great definition of leadership you have there...</comment>

<comment>I apologize for accusing you of sophistry.  I accept your point about rebellion being inspired by autocrats like Assad. The Assads have ruled Syria for many decades.  I see the rebellion as inspired by that history of repression (disappearances, torture) rather than the inevitable state reaction to the rebellion.I do blame the USA, Saudis, Qatar, etc. for the appeal and empowerment of extremism from before Al Queda through to today. I thnk my  reasons are much the same as yours and that we likely agree in principle if not in form."Assad must go" is not per se an intention to topple him directly, but when issued from DC by people who said the same about ME leaders that they did work to overthrow from Mossadegh through Saddam Hussein and  Gaddafi... while actively arming insurgents ... really the careful parsed distinction doesn't stand up.  The simpler interpretation of violent threat by world hegemon is what people around the world hear.To return to the OP, Clinton's position that "Assad must go" (arming rebels) and "ISIS must be destroyed" (bombing the strongest faction of rebels) is taking both sides in a civil war. That policy is a war crime.  Sanders is perilously close to that stance, but Clinton is all for it. Again.</comment>

<comment>The distinction is only important in understanding the administration policy. People accuse Obama of being soft and Clinton of being naive because they asserted the civil war won't end until Assad leaves. The same people badly misunderstand the priorities in Syria, with ISIS quickly having moved to public enemy number one. Second, there is a desire to end the civil war. This includes Assad leaving as a prerequisite, which conveniently the USA has wanted the man gone for awhile because his attacks against Americans in Iraq and his coziness with Russia (not to mention his lack of democratic credentials).Sure, Assad doesn't deserve all the responsibility. Turks, Saudis, Qataris, French, Americans, Iranians, Russians, and so on and so on. At this point we are all guilty of war crimes. But if you were to blame one person for the chaos, and you blame anyone but Assad, then you don't believe in accountability. He has not kept his people safe. Idiots in the USA complain because Obama has moved US soldiers out of harms way. If only they saw what a real failure of leadership like Assad meant for their families.Clinton a war criminal? Perhaps, but I don't make specific accusations without hard evidence and jurisprudence. Innocent until proven guilty. Sanders...come on. You can't be guilty simply for articulating a position. If he gets into office and starts bombing civilians, then yes, he is guilty as well, of course as soon as he is convicted.The last paragraph is not an excuse. It is a process, and it matters, at least in my opinion.</comment>

<comment>How about Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and even arguably Libya? Only Yugoslavian intervention could be described as a success.  And HRC and the R Clown Car (except Trump) want to bog us down in Syria.  "We need to save the Syrians!!! By making their civil war a three-way war so it never ends!!"  So while there may be a case for specific interventions, I don't think the quix0te Doctrine of "Don't Send Troops Unless You Have Real Allies In The Region" is likely to be adopted by more than Sanders and Obama.</comment>

<comment>I don't think the point was Iraq proves "dovishness is better" because Iraq, but rather Bernie displays better judgement because of the difference of opinion on Iraq.If you read the tidbit in the article that appeared to be a direct quote to Bernie, he hit the nail on the head. Why were there no estimates of the number of US causalities? When the US dropped atom bombs on Japan, one of the often stated reasons was to avoid massive casualties that would inevitably result from an invasion. Clinton is not given any such estimate, and is told Iraq is an existential threat to the USA, so we need to immediately launch a preemptive strike. Bernie asks questions, while Clinton gives her support. To her credit, she has publicly admitted the mistake, but still her inclination is not to ask questions. She thinks she knows already.Exercising good judgement requires good information.</comment>

<comment>Clinton is much too hawkish for my taste. She's more hawkish than a lot of the Republican field, including Trump, Cruz, and Paul, who don't seem to want a ground war in Syria.</comment>

<comment>Thank you, Connor. This was a very good article showing the difference in judgment by Bernie Sanders vs. Hillary Clinton. Almost everything he said in that speech on the floor has come true, but I think the biggest revelation is that even after the consequences of the Iraq War were known, Hillary Clinton did not learn from that "mistake" and continues interventionalist policies during her tenure as secretary of state. These policies further destabilized the region and has exacerbated terrorism. In essence, everything she did was worse. On top of all that, she fails to recognize the need to hold Turkey and Saudi Arabia accountable for their support of Islamic extremist groups.In provable terms, there is much to be said here, but I am actually more of a cynic and believe that the neocon actions are purposeful in destabilizing the region. This continuous warfare is all about hegemony with favorable allies or allies who comply and are complicit in the process because they benefit from the partnership. The main one is Saudi Arabia because they receive military aid and arms along with having the highest military budget in the region. They are one of the most non-secular, anti democratic human rights abusers on this planet and we support them anyway. They dominate the oil market and we benefit off of that relationship as well. Saudi and America have a mutual vested interest in destabilizing the surrounding countries. To me, this is all about having resource, economic, and geopolitical control of the region. On another aspect, the continuous war supports the military industrial complex Eisenhower warned about. War is the means by which this industry is funded and to keep profiting, there must be continuous conflict. It is against America's economic interests (by America I don't mean the citizens or as a whole, but the elites and corporate oligarchy) to be arbiters of peace.Even though the writing is on the wall and logic and evidence would lead many to the same conclusion if they freed themselves from the notion of American Exceptionalism, this article may be more effective because you can make this case without going very deep into the issue. Many people know about Hillary's actions. All that needs to be expanded is the People's knowledge of Bernie's actions for this to become a clear distinction. I wish this video (https://youtu.be/NdFw1btbkLM) was something he highlighted in his campaign more.</comment>

<comment>While Sanders and Clinton differed on the Iraq war vote, their differences on current policy are vanishingly small, at least on issues Sanders has actually articulated in any detail.On Iran, both support current policy of the Obama administration.Sanders:On Russia, "To temper Russian aggression, we must freeze Russian government assets all over the world, and encourage international corporations with huge investments in Russia to divest from that nation’s increasingly hostile political aims."ISIS, "“I have supported U.S. airstrikes against ISIS and believe they are authorized under current law, and I support targeted U.S. military efforts to protect U.S. citizens.""ISIS is an incredibly dangerous, powerful, and barbaric organization. For the sake of people in the Middle East and all over the world, they must be stopped."Syria:"Ending the civil war by means of a negotiated settlement requires Assad’s departure."Sanders supported NATO military force in Kosovo and humanitarian intervention as a US policy.</comment>

<comment>On current foreign issues, they are still distinctly different.1) Hillary advocates for a no-fly zone in Syria just like Republicans do. Bernie has not expressed desire to do that.2) Hillary wants to continue interventionalist regime change and take out Assad while at the same time, she wants to fight ISIS. In essence, she is battling both sides of a civil war and taking out Assad right now could cause the same kinds of power vacuums that ISIS has filled in Libya and Iraq. Bernie does not want to do this because he has seen this happen before and tried to stop it in the past.3) Probably the most important of the three I have mentioned - Hillary does not want to hold Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and other countries in the region accountable for their involvement in funding terrorism currently and over the years or make them be actively involved in fighting against the extremism and helping to bring stabilization and peace in the region. Saudi Arabia is the worst country in this region. They are predominately Sunni and follow a particular brand called Wahabbism. This is a religiously extremist sect of the Islamic religion which is very closely tied to the same values as ISIS. Saudi cut over 400 peoples heads off in the name of their religious laws and have jailed and executed dissidents. They are very anti-democratic and major human rights abusers. Hillary as SoS gave significant amounts of military aid and military arms to Saudi. We have no moral reason to back them in this region and she continues to do so. She also is alleged to have taken Saudi money at the Clinton Foundation while she was SoS. The conflict of interest doesn't get any greater than that. Bernie Sanders on the other hand has explicitly called out Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE, Turkey and others as needing to get their skin in the game and save Islam from the extremist ideology. He said their forces need to be on the ground and he wants to support Jordan, the Kurdish forces, and Iran as Shia moderates to help stabilize the region. Hillary has armed Sunnis in some naïve notion that they will be moderate.They are light-years away from each other on this third point.</comment>

<comment>1. He is very hawkish on ISIS and Syria. Since he supports air strikes and says ISIS "must be stopped" that makes the no fly zone a tactical difference of not much importance. Must be stopped means do what ever is necessary right?2. I quoted Sanders on Assad :""Ending the civil war by means of a negotiated settlement requires Assad’s departure."What about that don't you get? Requires Assad's departure....3. Sanders says he wants to work with US allies in the region, in a part I didn't quote. "Now if this is such a crisis to the region—Saudis have a big air force, you know. They have a lot of F-16s, why aren’t they involved? Why isn’t Kuwait involved?"He wants Saudi Arabia involved. The current policy of the administration is to work with Saudi Arabia where that is compatible with US interests.  That is Clinton's position.</comment>

<comment>You're being sarcastic, right?  Please tell me you are..As to the "Let the Saudi's bomb them" comment, is he aware of how that worked out in Yemen?  That's right up there with Cruz and Trump's carpet bombing suggestions.</comment>

<comment>Those are Sanders' words. Not mine, and as far as I can tell he means them, He also supports US air force attacks on ISIS.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the light then. *sigh*</comment>

<comment>I have to admit, Bernie does intrigue me. Its the "what if" thats so damm enticing</comment>

<comment>Yes, but a bit too much like roulette...</comment>

<comment>Better roulette than throwing your vote away for hillary.</comment>

<comment>You'd rather Truz or Crump?</comment>

<comment>heh</comment>

<comment>Absolutely, her hope-killing theme she and her establishment friends keep repeating that we need to contain any progress we make, because trying too hard is unrealistic.. if the democratic party is stupid enough to choose her to represent them, they don't represent me. I'll be voting for Bernie in the general no matter what.</comment>

<comment>Well then at least you're aware of where your vote will be going... don't complain when that s*** hits that wall.</comment>

<comment>All democrats should be aware that a vote for her is about as meaningful as a vote for Lincon Chafee - she is widely hated enough to drive down democratic turnout, and if she is up against trump he will take the independents. Because independents don't trust the system. H is the system, Bernie is fighting it, Trump is fighting it. The details of what they would do when elected do come into play, but against this backdrop. And when you look at her policies.. it's the same exact shit that got us into this mess. (I find her policies and behavior WAY more offensive than a word written without asterisks. We all should.)</comment>

<comment>All democrats and all moderate republicans need to think about the supreme court.  Vote for Bernie at your peril.</comment>

<comment>"Vote for Bernie at your peril."You misspelled "Hillary".</comment>

<comment>Another war that costs our nation trillions and kills hundreds of thousands of people is a little more important than the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>Yes and if we end up with a Republican in the White House we're at MUCH higher risk of that. Moderate republicans/centrists will never, ever vote for Bernie.  He's not nationally electable.</comment>

<comment>I doubt they'll vote for Clinton either.</comment>

<comment>I know, but the chance is definitely higher...</comment>

<comment>I don't think Clinton's foreign policy would be much f an improvement over many of the gop candidates. Could even be worse. For example, Cruz doesn't favour a no fly zone.</comment>

<comment>prefers to just carpet bomb as he sees fit...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I'd like a couple of parallel universes where Sanders and Trump were president and I could check in on them from time to time to see just how that worked out... I'd hate to live in either tho.</comment>

<comment>I will preface this by saying I am absolutely not an Islamophobe nor in any way am I anti-semitic, but foreign policy is today's world is incredibly complex and sensitive and as such religion/background cannot be ignored.Bernie's solution to step back and encourage the Saudis and other Muslim nations to take care of the terrorism issue is naive and unbelievably simplistic.  Their interests are simply not in line with ours and hardly with each other.Electing a Jewish president in this climate will not play out well for us in the Muslim world.We may not like the choices we have to make, but we have to deal with reality, and the reality is there's no simple answer and the stakes are extremely high.</comment>

<comment>Well, Burlington VT is still a sister city with a Russian city.  Sanders accepts that due to past commitments to Assad & Syria + geographic reasons, Russian must be engaged. So that's a start. Also, not dealing as fully as possible with Iran is necessary.  The geography & politics of the region won't go away by not dealing with them & talking is better than the MIIC alternatives.</comment>

<comment>Get a spine, Normal Kid. If you're seriously arguing that America should think twice before electing a Jewish president because rapidly antisemitic Muslim countries won't like it, then, literally, in your case, the Islamists have already won. You've been psychologically defeated.If you like what Sanders stands for, vote for him with pride, and if anyone complains because he's a Jew, you say, "Ef off, bigot, this is America."Bernie ain't my guy, but I tell you what, if he's yours, and you can overcome your "oh no, what will the Muslim nations think!" mentality to vote for him, get back to me here and I will reply with a virtual high-five, an atta boy and a good on ya.</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying that I won't vote for him because "Muslim countries won't like it", but I am acknowledging that it will further complicate diplomatic efforts and only encourage recruitment of jihadists.This is not what's holding me back from voting for him either.  I don't think he can win nationally, and I don't think he can actually achieve most of his platform.If only things were so simple Mr. Watch.  I would love to vote in a minority President.  However those are not my only considerations.</comment>

<comment>Well, the issues you raise, are, to me, a feature, not a bug. If you've got other reasons not to vote for him, fine, just don't let other nations' backwards bigotry be a factor. For one thing, they're unappeasable. If you tilt left in your politics, then you're probably weighing a vote for Hillary. Those same nations aren't exactly big fans of powerful, independent women running things, so you're right back to America making a choice that will complicate diplomacy and antagonize the Islamists.</comment>

<comment>Other nations' backwards bigotry is unfortunately very much an issue for us.  ISIS IS unappeasable, I completely agree.  Do we want the rest of the Muslim world to join them?  Believe me many, many more Muslims have issues with the Jewish state of Israel than they have with women.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is in favor of US airstrikes in Syria. He believes Assad must go. He believes the US should fight to destroy ISIS and should do that with its allies. He is essentially in agreement with Obama.</comment>

<comment>Hillary's foreign policy has created quagmires and saps american blood and treasure. Bernie's would allow us to focus on strengthening and developing our own country.It is discouraging to see Bernie and Rand Paul as the only ones who understand that the greatest threat to Empire is overextension.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that Sanders was right, he's no longer right now. You can't be dovish right now, the shit stew's been cooked and we all have to eat it.</comment>

<comment>How is he not right now?</comment>

<comment>If you're asking that question you clearly aren't paying attention.</comment>

<comment>how?</comment>

<comment>How???</comment>

<comment>I'm not one to call people out for being or having sock puppet accounts, but you're pretty dang obvious about it.</comment>

<comment>Not a sock puppet account. Asking you to elaborate on your position.</comment>

<comment>Three people asking the same question far enough apart that they'd see the comment and then one of them liking the other ones. Either sock puppet or spamming. And "how" is not asking to elaborate it's an ambiguous question on the order of a child constantly asking "why." Which is why the only one I gave even a direct response to actually had a complete sentence.</comment>

<comment>This article clearly debunks the argument that Clinton has the edge on foreign policy. Bernie's statement against the war in Iraq demonstrates so vividly the clarity of his thinking and the soundness of his judgment.   As he himself has pointed out, there is a difference between experience and judgment.  What is the good of experience if you don't learn from it?  Thoughtfulness may be mistaken for weakness by some, but give me wisdom over recklessness any day.</comment>

<comment>How much "experience" on foreign policy did Obama have? Bernie Sanders knows well the cost of war and to many voters that is an advantage. Meanwhile Clinton seems not to meet a war she doesn't like. In the first Dem debate she made the laughable assertion that Iran is our biggest threat.</comment>

<comment>The reason why Hillary has to some extent neutralized foreign policy as a campaign issue is that she has successfully touted her "experience" to a credulous press that has not seen fit to challenge her on the actual quality of that experience...and millions of gullible, low-information voters have bought it.Bernie should keep hammering away on this topic.  He really should.</comment>

<comment>he can't bought.</comment>

<comment>THANK YOU CONOR. This is the number one reason Bernie Sanders has my vote.</comment>

<comment>The same budget constraints and congressional gridlock that would make Bernie Sanders' domestic policy agenda dead on arrival would equally make d.o.a. Any Iraq War style invasion/occupation should any candidate currently running try to replicate W's failures. The next president will respond to events as they happen, and not be in a position to start wars for the hell of it. Bush got HIS war because 9-11 put the US in a militaristic mood that Bush and his people used to start a war they wanted to start. Additionally, Bush came into office wih a balanced budget free of spending constraints and a loyal, almost sycophantic congress ready to launch his agenda. The next president won't have those luxuries.And whatever Clinton's supposed (and largely exaggerated) hawkishness, she's more of a dove than ANY Republican running including "peace candidate" Rand Paul. I'd point out for the 1000th time that Libya has nothing in common with Iraq or that not intervening in an ongoing Libyan civil war had consequences too but that's too much nuance for this blog. Bush "won" the Iraq War and Libya was peaceful and stable before Hillary Clinton forced Obama to overthrow that nice man Gaddafi. Some fantasies must be embraced no matter the facts that disprove them. Rock on, Conor F. </comment>

<comment>I call BS. Hillary would start ten times as many wars as Rand Paul, 100x as many as Bernie. She isn't qualified to teach how to play a strategy wargame properly, let alone be president.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is in favor of using US air force against ISIS:"ISIS is an incredibly dangerous, powerful, and barbaric organization. For the sake of people in the Middle East and all over the world, they must be stopped.""“I have supported U.S. airstrikes against ISIS and believe they areauthorized under current law, and I support targeted U.S. militaryefforts to protect U.S. citizens."</comment>

<comment>Let's put that in some context with some other things he has said (all from http://feelthebern.org/bernie-... ):"Now if this is such a crisis to the region—Saudis have a big air force, you know. They have a lot of F-16s, why aren’t they involved? Why isn’t Kuwait involved?… We went to war to put the Kuwaiti government back. Where are they? Where are the billionaires in Qatar? If these guys in the region think that ISIS is such a great threat, they gotta put some skin in the game.""I have supported U.S. airstrikes against ISIS and believe they are authorized under current law, and I support targeted U.S. military efforts to protect U.S. citizens. It is my firm belief, however, that the war against ISIS will never be won unless nations in the Middle East step up their military efforts and take more responsibility for the security and stability of their region. The United States and other western powers should support our Middle East allies, but this war will never be won unless Muslim nations in the region lead that fight. It is worth remembering that Saudi Arabia, for example, is a nation controlled by one of the wealthiest families in the world and has the fourth largest military budget of any nation. This is a war for the soul of Islam and the Muslim nations must become more heavily engaged."</comment>

<comment>I quoted that Saudi air strike comment in another comment.The problem is that they kill a lot of civilians when they do that, Sanders didn't seem to realize they are doing it.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>The gridlock if HRC wins the presidency will make the past 7 years look like a picnic.  But she fails to win a lot of independents, etc. that are necessary for a win:  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...</comment>

<comment>For the past 7 years its taken 60 votes to advance a bill in the senate. The House is basically not functioning. Speaker John Boehner had to resign to pass a spending bill. How much worse can it get? How do you assume Republicans would be more intransigent with a Clinton presidency than Obama's? How would Bernie Sanders - an angry leftist - lead to more tranquil congressional waters than Clinton? </comment>

<comment>I would like to see Bernie address  his foreign policy  much much more than he has. He treats it like  an after thought. That turns a lot of people off and will cost us in votes. Foreign policy is very important if we truly want Bernie Elected. I would think that he needs to incorporate a better foreign policy in his stump speech. If he won't than we need to trumpet his judgement over Hilary's poor judgement. What does experience matter if your always wrong.Feel the Burn!!!</comment>

<comment>I'm afraid Sen. Sanders' foreign policy stances is basically isolationism/European (excluding the British and French tendencies to get involved in things from time to time).  Simply put, they aren't our problem, we have enough of our own, I believe he'd make Obama look like a war monger.I also believe that's the author's inclination and many Sanders supporters and is why he doesn't spend much time talking about it:A.) It's not the point he's trying to make. B.) It would turn a lot of people off.</comment>

<comment>That isn't true His foreign policy positions are essentially the same as the president's. http://feelthebern.org/bernie-...</comment>

<comment>oh gawh.. you weren't being sarcastic below, were you..What he says about ISIS in that link is a lot like listening to one of the Occupy folks talking about economics: "I really don't understand money but..."</comment>

<comment>"...Sen. Sanders' foreign policy stances is basically isolationism...Simply put, they aren't our problem, we have enough of our own...."God, that sounds good.</comment>

<comment>Not an uncommon sentiment. I feel the same way about someone saying "You can eat what ever you like!" It does sound good!I think Trump might have said it to get more votes in fact.</comment>

<comment>You presume that there are obvious negative consequences of a hands-off policy that are worse than the positives.  I disagree.  To me it sounds more like "Go ahead and eat more fat including saturated fat, it isn't bad for you despite what you've been told, carbs are the real culprit."  I.e., rather than being feel-good pablum, it's a thought-out position that differs from the conventional wisdom and is either objectively right or objectively wrong.Of course, we aren't going to settle that here in the comments section.  But after the last 15 years I'd say the evidence that interventionism produces good outcomes is...poor.  Bring on the meat and cheese.</comment>

<comment>No, I was just saying sounding good isn't necessarily good.I could (and have) argued that Obama's policies left a power vacuum and what filled it has been pretty bad (more then just ISIS). Of course you're also right, I can never prove that not stepping back from the area would have been better, just that plenty of people in the know came to similar conclusions, once the Monday morning quarterbacking started.I think pretty clearly, we weren't prepared to remain in the area for decades as we did in Europe and Asia after WWII, on the other hand, trying to wash our hands of the place didn't go so well either.  I tend to think their might be a middle ground but whatever we do, it won't be ideal or anywhere close to perfect. All we can try to do is learn from our mistakes and be prepared to update our opinions on what should be done based on the facts on the ground (which is not what Sen. Sanders is selling), Tom Friedman said in 2002 we'd not know how this will all work out for 100 years and he's probably right. Certainly it's not clear 14 years into it.You're also probably right about settling this in the comment section. Let me know if you ever want to discuss it over a Philly steak and cheese sandwich tho :)</comment>

<comment>I know that I am an outlier on this, but I reject that there is anything that "should be done based on facts on the ground."  Thinking that there are things we should be doing from around the world based on facts on the ground is exactly the problem.Nor have we ever tried washing our hands of the place, not in modern memory.  We are staunch allies of Saudi Arabia, Israel, etc.  The whole reason we care about Syria is because Saudi Arabia doesn't want a radical Sunni caliphate on its borders, inciting its native Sunni radicals to rise up.We are enmeshed.  That's the problem.  But we are never going to cut our ties to the House of Saud and the gulf states so I am wasting my breath.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is either negligent or willfully ignorant of the US's special place as sole remaining superpower.</comment>

<comment>Being a superpower isn't what it used to be because the nature of conflict has change as has the world economy.</comment>

<comment>Considering Clinton's single elected position that she held for two terms, and a conciliatory appointment to a position she was dismissed from does not constitute a impressive array of experience when compared  to Sanders experience.As an independent, Sanders was elected mayor and was reelected three times. In 1990, he was elected to represent Vermont's at-large congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. In 1991, Sanders co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as a congressman for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. In 2012, he was reelected with 71% of the popular vote.Couple his superior judgement while occupying these offices with the series of poor decisions that have plagued Hillary since the beginning of her political career and it's easy to see who is more qualified.Hillary floats on hype and patronage, not her abilities.</comment>

<comment>She only served on WalMart's board of directors for six years and should mean something for working people to also remember.</comment>

<comment>Are you saying that she casually disregarded the quality of life of millions of people to such an extent many employees require supplemental welfare on the US tax payers dime for her personal financial enrichment?In other news, Clinton picked long-time Monsanto lobbist Jerry Crawford to head up her “Ready for Hillary” Super PAC.</comment>

<comment>Hilary is well more than qualified to be President. Just look at the R ticket and care to tell me which one of those has any qualifications above hers. Secretary of State is a pretty big office, much less the Senate, and even as an active first lady. Ragging on Clinton to raise Bernie Sanders is beyond stupid.Still if I have a choice I'm voting Sanders. I want the world he lays out and IMO he has a plan for at least some of it to happen and to further the beliefs he champions. He is not pandering, like ALL of the other candidates. He lives his principles.</comment>

<comment>You are of course correct that she is imminently more qualified than the GOP contenders. Furthermore, I (like most others) will grudgingly vote for her should Sanders long shot at the nomination fail.I am simply making the comparison between Sanders and Clinton for the sake of the nomination. As far as pointing out her inferior qualities, these sorts of negative assessments from liberals and progressives will conclude once a nominee has been selected and will have little or no bearing on her capturing Republican votes should she make it to the General. There is no chance they will consider her at all in my opinion - the negative emotions for her run too deep among Republicans.While I am much more philosophically aligned and trusting of Sanders, my primary pragmatic concern is the potential of dampened enthusiasm a Clinton victory in the primary would have on potential Democrat voters. People are eager for change, and that mere possibility of change is what is keeping many of them engaged.</comment>

<comment>Well, sure.  Just because I don't want my cataract-plagued, slightly ditzy, grandmother driving the car, doesn't mean I'd rather have Leo the roid-head with a bellyful of Red Bull and Vodka.</comment>

<comment>The article makes an important point.  And to expand on it further, who in their right mind can possibly believe that we can bomb our way to peace.  The regime change antics of US intervention whether it be in Nicaragua, Iran, Iraq or Libya have not only failed to advance the safety and well-being of America but have undoubtedly exacerbated instability and that terrorist style violence spills out of these regions and threatens western nations in their own homeland. I'd vote for Rand Paul before I'd vote for Clinton for exactly this reason.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is in favor of removing Assad.</comment>

<comment>Miss Peru is in favor of world peace. Wanting something won't make it so.</comment>

<comment>After removing ISIS. Until the last debate, Clinton wanted Assad's removal as a front-line goal. Not quite sure how that is going to happen.</comment>

<comment>No not after, as a result of negotiations among anti-ISIS powers. Presumably the result would happen because the Russians made it happen.</comment>

<comment>He's in favor of other people, particularly Turkey and Saudi Arabia, getting involved in Syria.  I can't find him stating anything to the tune of 'America needs to get rid of Assad.'  I don't even know if he WANTS to get rid of Assad.  (I'd like a citation if you have one)  Keep in mind, Syria is pretty much a zero-sum game.  If Assad loses, ISIS wins.  I do believe Turkey and Saudi Arabia are important not so much in fighting ISIS, as in NOT SUPPORTING ISIS.http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-th...</comment>

<comment>Bernie may have been channeling George Carlin's "The Persian Gulf War", on youtube, sounds almost like Bernie's stump speech, including the corporate media, and how politicians divide us up.</comment>

<comment>This is an amazing video of Bernie addressing an empty congress about the folly of entering the first Iraq War, everything he said was true, no idea why this is not viral. If this doesn't bring a tear to your eye, you have a heart of stonehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Sanders was in favor of invading Afghanistan. He voted for it.He also supported the use of force in Kosovo against Serbia.</comment>

<comment>That lines up well with my views.  I thought we had to go into Afghanistan, was against Iraq.  Whether we should still be in Afghanistan 15 years later is another question.</comment>

<comment>I agree. I am trying to answer the claims made that Sanders views on foreign policy are greatly different from Obama or Clinton's based on his Iraq votes.  They aren't. CF exaggerates the importance of that vote in assessing the two candidate foreign policy. The proof of this is that they don't really differ on current or recent foreign policy issues.Of course, both of them are wildly different from the Republican candidates who are extremely dangerous.</comment>

<comment>How do their views on Syria/ISIS compare?  I understand Hillary is quite hawkish on Syria but I don't know exactly how her policies compare with Bernie's.</comment>

<comment>Sanders hasn't given details of his current policy beyond those on his website that I am aware of.So they both believe that ISIS is a legitimate target for the US, that Assad must be removed, that negotiations with other states and common actions with regional and NATO allies should be used. Both oppose US ground forces beyond special forces.I believe that Clinton is more sanguine about the prospects of benefit US involvement with ant-Assad factions in Syria than Obama. I don't know what Sanders thinks about that,On a no fly zone, Clinton favors that and Obama and Sanders (I think) do not.  I don't, but I don't think it there is any prospect of such in any case.</comment>

<comment>Sanders seems to favor leveraging strategic relationships over direct involvement. That is to say, minimize direct application of US assets in the region and employ an international coalition with more involvement from neighboring sovereigns such as the Saudi's who bear a greater stake in local events and have the third or fourth largest military budget in the world depending on how you perform the calculation, (Russia and Saudi Arabia are almost tied).Specifically Sanders has been very critical of the risks inherent in forced regime change which has generally yielded unfavorable results. Also, while it is in our strategic best interests to remain a leader in world affairs, the priority should be to seek peaceful solutions unless directly confronted militarily. That opening foreign markets and encouraging democratic forms of government abroad is an nearly impossible task after a host population is shattered along with their infrastructure and economy.Sanders appears to be very pragmatic. Conversely, HRC seems rather bellicose IMO.</comment>

<comment>They both share the policy of a mixed use of force and diplomacy, which Clinton refers to as "smart power". Both are multilateralists as is Obama, and both accept international law as a constraint. Both are what be termed "off shore balancers".smart power: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...offshore balancing: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>I have to say, I find it kind of absurd for the only current superpower saying to Jordon or Saudi Arabia or who ever, "We can't do this but if you do it, we'll be behind you all the way! (as long as you do it the way we want... and don't ask for much money...)" and then "darn.. why isn't anyone taking us up on this fine offer?"  That's really not pragmatic.To be honest, I find your analysis of the situation more coherent then Sanders', even if I don't agree with it.</comment>

<comment>Afghanistan, Serbia and Iraq are different countries. The entire non-Western European world is not one entity.The problems we are facing now stem from Iraq. If Sanders wanted no war at all that would be insane, but the use of force in instances such as Afghanistan and Kosovo were vastly more warranted than Iraq. It shows he reflects on each situation.</comment>

<comment>Thank you, great article.</comment>

<comment>Many people seem to think that Sanders is a dove or a pacifist. This is not true. Go here to see what he has said on various foreign policy topics:http://feelthebern.org/bernie-...He believes that the use of US force against ISIS in Syria is correct and that it is authorized by current US law.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the problem is too much DC "conventional wisdom" & "expert" opinion that's based on keeping the MIIComplex going for $$ & ego.  The opinion/predictions out of DC show a functioning group think that may prove fatal to press credibility outside of DC.  Once the voters start voting, the class presidents & valedictorians will find out if their wisdom is wisdom, or "naive, magical thinking."   But I've only been voting since 1970, so what do I know?</comment>

<comment>Sanders is simply the most viable candidate for the middle class. The continued money influence through lobbyists by the Military Industrial Complex needs to stop. If these corporations have their way, they will bankrupt us as a nation and keep us embroiled in perpetual conflict around the world.</comment>

<comment>Killary voted for the Iraq war "with conviction" and voted for the PATRIOT Act twice.Thanks, granny.</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate your grandmother? Work that out and you have a chance for a normal life, Pat.</comment>

<comment>Will it fix Killary's neocon voting record???You always lose.</comment>

<comment>Her tenure as SOS included the negotiation of the Iran embargo which got its stocks of enriched uranium the majority of its centrifuges and its enrichment reactor out of action without war. The Neocons wanted to bomb Iraq, Obama didn't, and Clinton didn't. So no.The GOP wants war with Iran and will abrogate the treaty if elected. Clinton or Sanders won't.</comment>

<comment>Her failures are s long list.  Iran included.</comment>

<comment>So you are a neocon and want war with Iran. You meant to praise Clinton by calling her a neocon. I see.Logic is not your friend either.</comment>

<comment>Clinton has spoken of her foreign policy perspective as "smart power", https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...I don't know of any place where Sanders has identified his conceptual perspective, or if he has one.</comment>

<comment>Lol, of course that's what we need - "Smart Power".Seriously, looking at your link, Smart Power is "... essentially the engagement of both military force and all forms of diplomacy".  And there's something in there about doing what's cost effective.Anyone who is against "Smart Power" must be for "Stupid Power" ???Bernie Sanders does seem to focus less on balancing military force with diplomacy, and more on identifying and protecting our interests while improving our overall ability to influence events.  Though instead of guessing, we should probably go back to feelthebern.org, and get some solid background.</comment>

<comment>I posted that link and quoted it several times in previous comments.No, the opposite of Smart Power is either all force or all diplomacy. Neocons are for all force. Isolationists and pacifists and many libertarians are for all diplomacy.It is clear that Sanders is for a mix of hard and soft power, so he is on the same pages as Clinton and Obama. </comment>

<comment>I think that if you want to see the world that Bernie paints, there's only one way to eventually get there .. vote for it .. support it .. keep it on the front burner.And as for health care, single payer is not as far off as Kevin Drum thinks. Single payer is a GIGANTIC WIN FOR BUSINESS IN THE US.Think about it just a bit ..no longer would an employer have to be involved in the health care market at all. What employer wouldn't LOVE that? Seriously this is a strong argument that I would like to see Sanders mention more often. This doesn't just have to be a "progressive" issue.</comment>

<comment>Many experts believe that single payer in the US would cost a lot more than Sanders thinks and would require much higher taxes net of current costs for healthcare to individuals.http://www.vox.com/2016/1/28/1...</comment>

<comment>Then it's time for some discussion on the mater and some more evaluation. Bernie is NOT telling you that the government will pick up the tab, he's telling you that your premiums will be much less and EVERYONE will be covered and treated fairly.But again, the point about boosting business interest gets no press.</comment>

<comment>Excellent point John.  Ford moved some Pinto production to Canada in 70s in part because of their national health care system reducing labor cost. Before NAFTA business executives used to make this point w.r.t. competitiveness.  After NAFTA they just offshored production.</comment>

<comment>If single payer ends up costing more than Sander's estimate - it will be because so many compromises will be made in order to pacify the existing healthcare insurance and pharmaceutical industries.But single payer is still the right way to go, and in the long run costs will be better contained then if we continue to try to "fix" our current mix of different types of coverage (including no coverage at all for many).</comment>

<comment>Thorpe's analysis makes contradictory assumptions.  He assumes worker compensation remains the same yet assumes that employers claw back 100% of the present premiums (reduction of current compensation) and pass on all of the new 6% tax to the employees (reduction of future compensation [or labor expense]).  So, in that case, where businesses game the system entirely, of course individuals and the government must pay more.  It is a faulty analysis.</comment>

<comment>The Vermont senator seems far less likely to start a war of choice as president, but that doesn’t seem to count for much in the Democratic primary.Easy answer:It's the same reasoning folks think that GOP always talking tough against foreigners and their leaders is actually good foreign policy judgement. It's ridiculous and stupid..not good policy judgement. To wonder why Obama won 2008 when everyone else was talking about their vote for Iraq war still baffles most pundits and Washington insiders to this day.I'm so glad us American voters understand this when the corporate media idiots talk to themselves while we vote for authenticity and good judgement as commander in chief.Gotta love democracy!</comment>

<comment>Bernie has been on the right side of history for his entire political career. Even when being right was hugely unpopular - Racial equality, marriage equality, wealth inequality, the quagmire we call Iraq.Not only do I support most of his positions but I really like the fact that he's pretty much always f*ck!ng right.#Bernie2016</comment>

<comment>Was leaving Saddam in Kuwait and with his chemical weapons the right choice?The first Gulf war got him out and installed a UN operation to remove his chemical weapons. Sanders voted against that.</comment>

<comment>Bernie opposed the use of (almost entirely AMERICAN) force in Iraq Pt.1 in lieu of FIRST utilizing other means of resolving the illegal invasion of Kuwait. And again, correctly predicted the outcome years in advance.I was personally FOR kicking Saddam out of Kuwait and that campaign was hugely successful from a solely military/strategic standpoint, it was quite literally a 'slaughter' and may have been the call that needed to be made at the time, however, he still opposed the use of force as a first option, and was still right about it.</comment>

<comment>He voted against authorization to use force by the coalition that was already assembled and included US forces that had been moved to the region. He wanted to continue economic sanctions that were in place.There was a UN vote authorizing the use of force. Six months had passed since the occupation of Kuwait.Further delay had no chance of reversing the occupation, his vote was a mistake.timeline:http://www.warchronicle.com/ir...</comment>

<comment>And we should have held out longer. Six months in Kuwait isn't very long if you consider the 20yr+ clusterf*ck Iraq has become.</comment>

<comment>The war was over in 90 days. US forces left. The UN supervised the disarmament of Iraq and removal of chemical weapons. An arms embargo was maintained.History can be instructive if one is familiar with it.</comment>

<comment>As I said, it is largely looked upon as a highly successful military campaign. Saddam's forces were quite literally decimated... Okay, m w, since you seem so very adamant on this point. I'll give it to you. Bernie was wrong on Iraq 1.0.The rest of the things he was VERY right about remain valid, do they not?</comment>

<comment>He was not wrong. The first Gulf war spawned Al Quaida. It would have been far better to let Saddam have kuwait.  Besides, Bush Sr.s April Glaspie basically gave Saddam tacit approval for the invasion.</comment>

<comment>That is totally false. Al Qaeda has its own causes. And Saddam is not one of them, that was the Bush cover story. I'd like someone to ask Sanders if he thinks Saddam should have been left with Kuwait and his nerve gas and his oil revenue. (For comparison, Sanders condemns Russia for taking the Crimea and its role in the war in the Ukraine. How does that work?)</comment>

<comment>AQ was around prior to the Gulf War, but we put a lot of US troops in Saudi Arabia the "holy" land, and kept them there.  That really pissed bin Laden off and was one of the top complaints he regularly listed.  Not that he wouldn't have found another excuse, but still.</comment>

<comment>The rest reduce to the Iraq war vote, since he agrees substantially with Clinton on current policy.I focus on the fact that the resolution Clinton voted on included a broken promise to let UN inspections proceed. Had that happened the report would have been that no wmd's were present and war would have been averted.Clinton did not expect that Bush would break that promise. So I don't see it as any big failure of judgement. She didn't support the war after it was discovered that no wmd's were present.</comment>

<comment>And yet somehow Clinton missed the fact that Saddam did stand down all of his MWD programs in the 90's.  And the fact that the UN inspectors confirmed this over an over until they had to leave because Bush was beginning to attack.In the town hall a few days ago she described the Iraq War as a mistake in execution - not the absolute a priori mistake it was. She is still chooses Empire over empiricism meaning her experience is less than worthless - it is dangerous.</comment>

<comment>In hindsight? Yes. Absolutely. Far better a dictator than chaos and Islamists running amok.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you get the fact that Saddam was left in power after the first Gulf war. There were two wars a decade apart.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I wasn't clear. I'm aware of the two wars.That said, yes, I think him being left in Kuwait would have been preferable to America being sucked into the region with the result being what you see today-- chaos and Islamists.</comment>

<comment>The US has been deeply involved in the region since 1948.</comment>

<comment>So their human rights are less important because you're scared of Islamists (and don't know the definition of the term apparently)?</comment>

<comment>The foreign policy issue only affects the minds of stupid people. The President isn't his own team. He will have tons of advisors with much better knowledge than both Bernie and Hillary. I do not put foreign policy on the top of my list because I am not voting for the President of the planet earth. I am voting for the President of the United States and Bernie's policies will restore the middle class.</comment>

<comment>I agree that Sanders was on the right side re Iraq, and Clinton on the wrong side.  I would also like to see the USA become less entangled in stupid wars.  But that needs to be a managed transition.  I am concerned that Sanders lacks the nuance to do that.</comment>

<comment>Ah, but Sanders is really good at dealing with details, while not losing sight of his objectives.  He's a master at finding common ground - and collaborating based on that common ground.This is evident both in Burlington, and in his tenure in the House and Senate, as people who disagree with him tend to think highly of him.  Bernie Sanders has always been good to work with.</comment>

<comment>I think Bernie should hammer away at getting Hillary put in the pokie. That's the only way to get rid of that old criminal.</comment>

<comment>If it weren't for the fact that Bernie Sanders is a more authentic candidate, it would be worth seeing Hillary get elected just to find out if it would give Rush Limbaugh cerebral aneurysm.</comment>

<comment>When I read the headline that included "Bernie Sanders's Superior Foreign-Policy Judgment," I thought I had ventured onto an article from "The Onion."What's Bernie's plan for ISIS?  In the debate he said his plan was for only Muslim troops.  Moderator Martha Raddatz said to him "The administration has tried that over and over again. If it doesn't work and this threat is so great, what's your plan B?"Bernie's response?  "My plan is to make it work, to tell Saudi Arabia that instead of going to war in Yemen, they, one of the wealthiest countries on Earth, are going to have to go to war against ISIS.  To tell Qatar, that instead of spending $200 billion on the World Cup, maybe they should pay attention to ISIS, which is at their doorstep."Uh huh.  Make it work.  Bernie would whine at Saudi Arabia and Qatar about how they spend their money.  I doubt that would make anyone safer.</comment>

<comment>The problem for any Democrat is that in foreign policy the US public acts like an impatient and rather nervous cop patrolling a difficult neighbour hood. They are too quick to go for the gun.Many Americans do not seem to have any expectation that their diplomacy will work. A good recent example is the Bundfest in Oregan. A large number of heavily armed and riled up men take over a relatively unimportant building in the countryside. The fact that "it took three weeks" for Law enforcement "to respond" is seen as weakness. With no more info than I read in the media, I think the matter was reasonably well handled. Pity about the death.I think Americans overrate what can be done with firepower. Before any war you have politics. After any war you have politics as usual. War just allows you to ignore reality for a while. You can blast it or bomb it or shoot at it, but reality is never defeated.Many Americans seem to believe that the people of the world should love them. And they will bomb them until they do. It is an odd idea. American has much more to offer than bombs and guns yet most Republicans speak of nothing else. Only Rand seems sane to a non-American.The key fact demonstrating that America is getting things wrong is that they have not won a war since WWII, yet the USSR was defeated without one. Digest that.</comment>

<comment>I think we deserve some credit for Yugoslavia.  Also, Gulf War I went pretty well.  You also need to discriminate between the American people, who are actually mostly isolationist, and the leadership and media.  A perfect example is ISIS.  I don't know what country you are in, but even in Europe, who have suffered a fair amount at the hands of ISIS doorknobs (chin up France!) ISIS is mostly regarded as a bunch of backwards psychos kicking around between Syria and Iraq, dangerous mostly to unarmed towns in the area.  In America, on the other hand, they have been whipped up into the next incarnation of Al Qaeda by the news media and certain political factions.Why?My theory is we have a bloated military we need to justify.  The fact that its been unsuccessful as a tool of statecraft since WWII is glossed over a great deal.  And, to be fair, the Russians and Chinese really were in an expansionist phase for about thirty years there.  So when they were still knocking around, our military made slightly more sense.  Now that we are building stealth bombers to oppose guys technicals, its a little more ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Because it is and the press doesn't want the secret to get out.</comment>

<comment>Bernie's assessment of Iraq looks prophetic. That is exactly the kind of intelligent strength that we need in a Commander and Chief.</comment>

<comment>Excellent analysis. I've never understood why I can't convince people that Hillary would be a bad president because of her vote to invade Iraq. Perhaps it was more political: she thought voting against war would have negative political repercussions, but that's no excuse, it's worse because it means she has no conscience.</comment>

<comment>Sanders also voted against the use of force in the first gulf war. Saddam was forced out of Kuwait, disarmed and had his chemical weapons destroyed by a UN sanctioned coalition force in 90 days. So was he right that time?</comment>

<comment>Yes he was right. How was it our battle? btw., that conflict and the bases that remained in Saudi Arabia spawned Al Quaida. Also, if you recall, Bush Sr.s emissary, April Glaspie, basically gave Saddam a wink and a nod ahead of his invasion of Kuwait -- the whole thing didn't have to happen.</comment>

<comment>Because the middle east is unimportant and the elimination of a sovereign state by force is not a US concern? Just like in Russia in the Crimea--which he condemns?  And if Russia invades the Ukraine again and holds more of it, what then?Sanders wants a worldwide freeze on Russian assets so he is not Ok with that.</comment>

<comment>Would you like us to go in and liberate Crimea? That's would be an even more  foolish action than the Iraq war.</comment>

<comment>First, it's al-Qaeda. You lose credibility not knowing the name. Second, al-Qaeda dates back to the mujahideen in Afghanistan prior to the first Gulf War. The first Gulf War did not "spawn" al-Qaeda.</comment>

<comment>Bin ladin himself claimed his motivation was us presence in Saudi Arabia.</comment>

<comment>Bin Laden claimed many more motivations than that. But it's a fact that they existed before the Gulf War. Formally as early as '88, though functionally before that.</comment>

<comment>The "West," and especially Hillary Clinton, never seem to grasp majority/minority dynamics, even though they have led to almost all of the recent bloodbaths: in Kosovo, in Rwanda, etc. We put the northern alliance in charge of Afghanistan, the Shia in charge of Iraq. Maliki was tortured by the Sunnis and started prosecuting them, leading to Sunni support for the radical ISIS. Does Clinton even recognize how far the Alawite minority will go in supporting Assad? They believe that they will be completely wiped out, so they will probably fight until they are. Clinton has this ridiculous idea about "regime change." I don't know why she has so little insight into world history.</comment>

<comment>When Clinton was on Rachel Maddow, she claimed that she knew nothing about the debate schedule. Does anyone really believe this, that she did not consult with Wasserman, the former co-chair of her campaign? It is a little lie, but one that we tend to overlook in our cynical times. And yet, the Bush administration's little lies about Iraq, that Saddam tried to get nuclear materials in Africa, or that he bought aluminum tubes to build centrifuges (they were clearly for missiles), were lies that were widely exposed by the intelligence and scientific communities. When Bush brought these lies out in the State of the Union, anyone with a modicum of intelligence (in both senses) KNEW they were lies. But Bush gave cover to those craven politicians who voted for the war for their own survival. And Clinton accepted this cover. She still claims that she was fooled by the intelligence. Do you believe this?</comment>

<comment>The true answer is somewhere in the middle.  As Obama's tenure proved, apparently once you are in the "driver's seat" of the metaphorical foreign policy "car", speed feels good.  It wasn't long before he was making foreign policy decisions that would have lined him up with certain moderate Republicans of the 80's.  Meanwhile, a Hillary presidency virtually assures continued U.S. activity in the middle east, and complicity with Israel's current agenda.  Only Sanders seems willing to concede that U.S. action in the middle east is not sustainable.  Whether he would be able to maintain that rationale as President is another story.</comment>

<comment>Wow, that's putting a lot on one vote-- I mean, Clinton didn't go over there and start the war herself----and completely discounting a career of diplomatic successes.  You could start with Clinton's time at Yale when she monitored negotiations between faculty and students during campus riots. She was notably respected by both sides for her leadership. As SOS Clinton personally brokered a cease fire between the Israelis and Palestinians and secured new START treaty with Russia.  Her incredible diplomatic efforts led to effective international Iran Sanctions. At Copenhagen, Clinton succeeded in convincing China to agree to carbon reductions for the first time. She has great diplomatic skills and emphasizes on the campaign stump that her foreign policy will center on diplomacy. It is completely ridiculous to sum up the quality of her judgment by one vote on the Iraq War.  Bernie has repeatedly voted against the Brady Bill and with the crisis of gun deaths in America, it seems very poor judgment to favor the gun industry over American lives. One thing for sure, as President, Clinton would never send our country to war on false intelligence.It's also premature to call Libya a foreign policy disaster; it is still a developing situation monitored under the United Nations Security Council.  It is not possible to say definitively that Libya would have been more stable if Gaddafi had remained in power.  It does makes for a good attack line on Clinton, just like the tragedy of Benghazi, but I would point to the fact that under SOS Clinton, U.S. alliances increased in number and are quite strong. International alliances are so important when facing the spread of ISIS.</comment>

<comment>It's not premature. Libya was a debacle, almost entirely because a neglect to build institutions after the military defeat, and because the US is still uncomfortable engaging with Islamist parties.</comment>

<comment>Hillary voted for the Iraq War, then against the Surge because the 2008 election politics required it.  That's a double bad.She was for escalation in Afghanistan. She argued vociferously with Obama to arm the Syrian rebels.  She is for putting up a no-fly zone in Syria, which she doesn't seem to recognize is an act of war which could actually get our pilots into a real shooting war.  She was for major air strikes on the Assad regime. She supported the Libya debacle.  She was a big factor in the expansion of Obama's drone wear.  She was for the move on the bin Laden compound, etc.Not all of these positions were wrong, but most of them were, and they surely point to a major hawk.</comment>

<comment>Caling out Clinton's unwavering stance on ousting Gaddafi is 'just like Benghazi' attack line in no way at all.  Her insistence on 'regime change' is a repeat of the Iraq War mistake with much the same result.  You may not like it (probably don't know it) but Iraq, Libya and Syria were some of the most liberal states towards women and minorities in the ME.  The results of regime destruction has left millions displaced internally and/or fleeing to Europe.  Thousands drowning in the Mediterranean.  In my view, repeated willful application of policies that have horribly set back milions of women and children does not recommend a candidate.  Quite the opposite.Let me know if they reopen the parliament and airport in Libya then maybe we can downgrade it from the disaster that it currently is.</comment>

<comment>I'm Jewish and will freely admit I don't support U.S. policy toward Israel. I am against settlements and decry human rights abuses of Palestinians.  I also don't support the death penalty.  But I have a Senator and a political voice and also can support groups like Shalom Achshav.  No, I don't agree with Clinton on everything-- but where people criticize her for "changing with the wind" I see a very smart person who absorbs information and will change when convinced she was wrong.</comment>

<comment>The other key difference is the sense of opportunism which she projects with her acceptance of speaking fees from key donors.  Sanders seems to have no such motivation.</comment>

<comment>What went right in Iraq (quite a bit):http://www.theguardian.com/wor...What went wrong (from an Atlantic Monthly columnist):http://www.theatlantic.com/int...The War produced pretty much the results we could have hoped - a promising embryonic Arab democracy, and a surge of moderate politics in the form of the Arab Spring. Obama did well with these in his first term, but his second has been a disaster.If Saddam had remained in Iraq? The answer can only be intutive. But I am certain Iran would never have given up its nuclear ambitions - and my own intuition is that we would be witnessing a hair-raoising three way nuclear race between Iraq, Iran, and Israel.In any case, our present problems did not being with the invasion of Iraq. They began with its abandonment. They don't go back 12 years, but four.[P.S. I was against the war. But you have to look at events they way they happened, not reason from an ID fixe. The War produced an open ended process, that went quite badly from 2004-6, quite well from 2007-11, and disastrously from then on. The one way to insure a process doesn't go well is not to participate in it.]</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? There was widespread evidence that Saddam had lost his marbles: a lot of his time was devoted to writing a novel. Due to the no-fly zones in the north and south, he had lost control of much of Iraq, and he was losing more and more control by the day. His bloodthirsty sons ruled by fear, not by any popular support, and probably could not hold on to power.</comment>

<comment>Click the first link. Argue with Barack Obama and Joe Biden.And don't think history would have gone the way you want it to. History doesn't make it so.</comment>

<comment>Uh, no, it's not history, it's reality: when you disrupt the state, there is widespread suffering, and when you dissolve the armed forces, and all of a sudden leave a bunch of armed men unemployed, and then oppress the religious group that these armed men belong to, you are asking for trouble.Your logic is the "best of all possible worlds." Basically, the tool of the apologist.</comment>

<comment>Were you writing of the French Revolution? The American Revolution? The Civil War (in the South)? Or the Iraq War?Because ALL major paradigm changes have those effects. But in the long run the  first three are perceived as monumental improvements in the human condition. Saddam Hussein was a psychotic tyrant, and the nation seethed with a sectarian conflict 500 years old. Removing Saddam, and steering that conflict into the safe harbor of a Constitutional government were tremendous changes.Here's another cite, from the Washington Post - none of these are Fox News - to the same effect about what went wrong-https://www.washingtonpost.com...Essentially, the issue for Barack Obama was not that matters were so bad, but that they went so well that he believed he could eliminate Iraq as a policy concern. I don't just mean militarily - I mean in EVERY way.  Remember the infamous jv remark? That was a paradigm.The War was neither won nor lost. It wasn't either the smartest move or the biggest mistake. It was an event, that the West could and did exploit through 2011 to begin alleviating some of the chronic social and political problems of the MidEast. And then . . . . the US did what it always does . . .  it left.</comment>

<comment>A "monumental improvement" to the million dead.</comment>

<comment>Yup. Much better to bend the knee to old George, or Louis, or Massa.</comment>

<comment>You actually think that you can get any kind of objective view through interviews of Obama and a WashPo article? Read a bit more, please.</comment>

<comment>Beats not reading at all.Obama's speech was echoed by a zillion links at the same time. But what was that I said about an item of religious faith?</comment>

<comment>I see. So you think that I am making these arguments on religious faith, that I make am pulling these facts out of the air. I am done responding to you.</comment>

<comment>Ah . . . . you didn't cite any sources, or facts. I noticed the 'million dead'. That was from a Lancet study that was completely discredited.So , yeah, religious faith will do for a metaphor. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>So I'm supposed to provide citations to a guy who writes about "links" and gives me a WaPo article.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. You are supposed to provide citations, It's the difference between zealotry and thought,</comment>

<comment>"The West" never did any such thing. You're living in a fantasy of American omnipotence.</comment>

<comment>Not omipoitence, just beneficial effect. You're not going to solve the problems of a half millennia in 5 years - only the war protesters ever insisted on that. But you can start the process.The reilgious zealot can't tolerate that nuance. The War was bad, Bad, BAD!!!! Never mind anything to the contrary.</comment>

<comment>You've exposed yourself as a bloviating troll. I tried talking substance. You did nothing but continue insults and prove you have absolutely no real knowledge of the topic.I'm walking away. Until the next time I see you spreading misinformation I suppose. Maybe you'll grow up.</comment>

<comment>Well, there you go. Anyone who reads this can see. I gave you three solid links (one to a major Obama supporter on this site). You have nothing to say or add. I write of process, which is actually what happens historically (no society eliminates conflict altogether) - and I get this melange of surly insult.And you are suprised to be characterized as a zealot? What other characterization is there?You don't win these encounters, friend. You slink off into the night muttering puerile insults.</comment>

<comment>I gave you one, not to popular press, which you just ignored.You have no idea what happens historically. You're arrogantly lecturing someone with degrees in both of the fields you're pretending you're competent in.If you think you "won" this, you're more delusional than I thought. You look like a pompous troll. You might fool some people on this troll-laden site, but not anyone that counts. Foreign policy, and the consequences, aren't a game to me. Apparently it is to you.</comment>

<comment>I clicked your link. It was inapposite to the point you try to make. I addressed this above,If you actually have any expertise in the field, demonstrate it. As noted, you insist on a historical determinism that is absolutely preposterous in any other context.  You completely discount the effect of intervening causes and actions.History is a process, friend. It doesn't end. You don't look back at an event 12 years in the past, discount everything that came between (some very counterintuitive) and procaim an inevitability. There was none about the American Revoilution, Civil War, etc - and in its size, Iraq was comparable..If what you've shown here is your best effort at thought, God save us all if you do have a degree. We're back at Animal Farm - Bush bad, Obama good.Now slink off again and try to pretend you actually have something to say, other than an endless politically correct chant.</comment>

<comment>I'm not your friend. I find you to be a loathsome individual.The events of the Iraq war are not "history". They are too soon, and too partisan. One of the best historians I've ever met once said "be careful trying to analyze anything in the past 50 years. There's too much baggage for good history". You're using it as an appeal to an authority that does not support you.Have fun with your usual trolling. I hope I do not become the angry, ignorant old man you are.</comment>

<comment>That historian you quote was right.So why didn't you listen to him? Because you are the party insisting on absolute historical judgments for an event only a decade old.The greatest mistake, etc. So bad Hillary is to be censured for it.My point, in this Eloi refuge, is actually counterpoint. Maybe Bernie Sanders ascendancy in foreign policy isn't so ascendant after all. Maybe there is more to be said. Maybe Hillary was on the right side. (I will vote for Sanders over Hillary, btw, . Hillary over Trump, Sanders or Biden over any Republican, any Republican except Trump over Hillary).You are the one who stridently defends an idee fixe.</comment>

<comment>I did listen to him. I'm treating this as a political science issue through my experience with the MENA and systemic analysis. I'm relying on that literature, not your misunderstanding of historical methodology.Eloi refuge? What a pathetic faux-intellect you are. I'm done. Go back to your condescension and sad insults. Again, I strongly never hope I become the sort of grumpy, arrogant old man you are. Gods willing.</comment>

<comment>Ah, I  see. And since it is political science and not history, absolute pronouncements about events too recent to be analyzed can be made with confidence.Are you kidding?</comment>

<comment>I don't know why I keep letting you baiting me. I trust my experience and sources far better than I trust a noted troll like you. If you don't like it, well, I really don't care.</comment>

<comment>Except that you do care. You care passionately.You're hampered by trying to defend the impossible, that the present situation in Iraq traces back to the invasion itself, that no intermediate causes had any material effect, that therefore (if you agree with the premise of the ELoi spokesperson who writes articles here) that Bernie Sanders showed the greater wisdom. But that is simply not defensible rationally. A great deal happened between 2003 and today's date, much of it quite positive, and a number of signficant witnesses point the  finger at Obama for catastrophic decisions in 2011 et seq.So your absolutist case has huge problems, which you cover by rhetoric - I'm a troll (no I'm not), I insult you (read your first post, friend), etc. But all I ever did was post counterfactuals. That should be quite endurable - except that it challenges an article of faith of your secular religion.And you, True Believer, find that too much to bear.</comment>

<comment>The Iraq War was a war of aggression.  A war of aggression is a Class A war crime. It's what WE hung the Nazis for after WWII.</comment>

<comment>Yup. Never mind all those UN resolutions.</comment>

<comment>In those revolutions the people overthrew the state.  And the Reign of Terror doesn't really buttress your argument.The invasion and occupation of another country that is not even a minor threat (being 10,000 miles away) is not just a huge mistake, it is a war crime.  They hung a bunch of Nazis in the late 40s for starting WWII, not for Auschwitz.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely right. The only valid revolution are internal. Perish the thought that any foreign power should intervene.Those Goddammed French. What the hell were they doing assisting American rebels?And we should have impeached that damned Lincoln. The slaves should have freed THEMSELVES.</comment>

<comment>OMG you are such a sophist.  Hopeless really.  Personally I am quite satisfied that the Confederacy lost their reactionary war of secession. If only they would accept that fact completely.These US international problems don't go back 4, 12 or even 70 years.  More like to the point when our murderous policy of Manifest Destiny began to include Cuba, Puerto Rico, the rest of Latin America, the Philippines and so on.  The problems of empire are inherent and will never go away no matter which side of your mouth you argue out of next.</comment>

<comment>If you don't like your pompous pronouncements of universal principles instantly deflated by concrete extants, choose better universal principles - not that any really govern human history, but even so.FYI, in many parts of the South, the conflict is still known as 'The War of Northern Agression'. The Confederacy regarded itself as a separate nation, Considered abstractly, that's more right than wrong. So your characterization as 'secession' is simply an means of greasing your way out of a real stupidity.Manifest Destiny goes back to the 1840's. So you've given yourself two centuries to work with. Well done. </comment>

<comment>Uh huh - so now who thinks the slaves should have freed themselves?  Or would that have been sedition in favor of the War of Nothern Aggression in your ? Or.. are you going to continue to go completely off topic and ... Bleh.  We could debate Bernie's judgement vs. Clinton's.  No point in debating yours.</comment>

<comment>Uh . . .  that the slaves should have freed themselves is what YOU wrote. I quote:In those revolutions the people overthrew the state. And the Reign of Terror doesn't really buttress your argument. You implied that somehow the Iraq liberation wasn't authentic because the 'people' hadn't done it themselves. So I gave you an example of one in which the liberated party did not participate. You were too smug to understand.As for the Reign of Terror  . . . yeah, exactly right. You missed the point entirely (pretty good at that, actually). The French Revolution WAS followed by a nightmare of chaos . . .  as was the American Revolution, fortunately not as dark. Had you lived then, you'd be running around declaring that the public was better off under Louis XVI [George III] [Saddam} and the whole thing was a disaster. Those inevitable interregnums of chaos and disorder just utterly disqualify the possibility of the process, in your myopic world view.  And, as time went on, you'd continue citing 1793[1783]  [2003] and nothing that happened later would make any difference.Pretty dumb, if you ask me. And very, very reactionary - please don't celebrate the Fourth of July. You would have been a Tory and a Copperhead all the way - that Thomas Jefferson was a dangerous guy.  Keep the old order safe - your motto.But that is a fair assessment of your pronouncements. You mossbacked reactionaries really don't get it. </comment>

<comment>Another lightweight gives up. Typical Eloi.</comment>

<comment>That conflict was steered into boiling over by the first US Ambassador disbanding the armed forces and sending them home with their weapons. Then US/CIA Ambassador Negroponte and his implementation of "the Salvadoran option".  Safe harbor?</comment>

<comment>Of course. We never lived the year 2003, did we? See other posts of mine.The occupation indeed went very badly between 2003 and 2006, very well between 2007 and 2011, and very badly from 2011 to the present. Time DID continue to elapse after 2003.I could just see you in 1791, pontificating that the chaos that followed Yorktown doomed any chance of nationhood.In fact, I can see you as a reactionary in most of the major liberating changes in world history. They all involve the collapse of an established, though illegitimate regime, and an intervening period of chaos. Horrible!Ah  . . .  to reactionaries, that is.</comment>

<comment>That's ridiculous. The war was an unmitigated disaster begun on false pretenses. The UN inspectors were not even allowed to finish their work before the invasion began.</comment>

<comment>Click the first link. Go argue with Barack Obama - or Joe Biden, when he said in 2010 that creating a democracy in Iraq might be the administration's crowning achievement.Avoid making historical judgments articles of religious faith.</comment>

<comment>Your links are trash. Obama lies half the time.</comment>

<comment>Well, that makes for a simple life.</comment>

<comment>The sordid history of the UN inspection doesn't help too much. They were never going to finish. They'd been at it how many years?Which does not in any case change the fact that (a) Saddam was an ogre, and deposing him a good deed, and (b) that his deposition created opportunities as well as risks. The US actually exploited those opportunities effectively through 2011.</comment>

<comment>The UN inspectors could have searched forever and never found what wasn't there.</comment>

<comment>What a shame Saddam didn't fully cooperate, then. Amazing he kept facilities hidden, refused to cooperate, evicted them from the country,</comment>

<comment>What was ever found besides some few lost chunks buried in the early 90's that actually prove the point that there was NO ongoing program of WMD production?The inspectors stated very clearly that they left because Bush admin warned they couldn't guarantee that they wouldn't get hit with Bush's airstrikes.You claim others are out of touch with reality and the proceed to return to playing with little strawmen that burned up over a decade ago.</comment>

<comment>I am talking about 1997, when Saddam evicted the inspectors.You have a short selective memory. Iraq never permitted a full open inspection.</comment>
