<comment>I thought Cruz was supposed to be smart.</comment>

<comment>He is smart as hell. Cruz is letting Trump take the sniper fire while himself keeping quiet so as not to alienate Trump's electoral base. If Trump falters during the primary season, expect Cruz to take the greatest share of his voters. If Trump is elected president, then meet Attorney General Cruz.</comment>

<comment>But Trump is exceedingly unlikely to win the general, and the closer Cruz gets to Trump the less likely he is to win the general, either. So it's risky.</comment>

<comment>Lmao. You better hope the silent majority doesn't exist.</comment>

<comment>The non-silent, non-majority sure does. They call themselves the "silent majority".</comment>

<comment>Those are the Trump people who are either too busy to campaign or bother with polls (GOP business professionals, young GOP adults), or don't want to admit publically that they are for Trump (secretive). He's prob higher for sure in these liberal polls - HuffPost, etc. That's why we had the shocking big blowout in 2014.</comment>

<comment>I don't remember being particularly shocked at the 2014 election.  Appalled that there are that many @ssholes in this country, yes.  Shocked, no.  The last major polling shock I remember is Karl Rove in 2012 nearly assaulting Megan Kelly on Fox when it called the election for Obama.  Thus, if there is major skewing of the polls, it is within the echo chamber of the far right who believe that they are still a majority.</comment>

<comment>Delusional - 2014 was a shock because the liberal media thought their polls were so accurate. A sad day for them and it was awesome. </comment>

<comment>I'm delusional?  I dunno, here is a pre-election prediction that was one off from the actual results.  It's from politico which I'm pretty sure is one of the usual suspects in the "lamestream Media"  Noone was surprised by the 2014 election results, except, apparently, you.http://www.politico.com/2014-e...</comment>

<comment>They were in denial and Dem shill Politico tried to deny it. That night and the following week- "shocked"  was heard frequently. The polls never came to predicting the landslide. History was made.</comment>

<comment>Sure. In the face of evidence to the contrary keep repeating your belief I can't argue with "nu uh". How the hell can you say that politico was in denial?  They were predicting it to within 1 result of what happened!</comment>

<comment>Ok they were in the minority. They've suddenly turned more liberal - not so much back then perhaps.</comment>

<comment>As I said, you can't argue with nu-uh.  Here are a few more sites predicting a massive GOP winhttp://www.electionprojection....http://www.realclearpolitics.c...http://www.270towin.com/2014-s...Do you know what I couldn't find?  A single site that predicted a democratic victory in the House or Senate in 2014.</comment>

<comment>Too bad you were not watching - & Governor upsets.  I'm talking the states that they thought were going Dem but went bigtime to Repub.</comment>

<comment>OK, show me one pre-election poll, analyst, talking head whatever that called a major race for the Democrats that went GOP.  Then show me 4 different ones, like I just did for you that took me all of 30 seconds to find.  If it was everywhere, it should be pretty easy.ETA:  I'm not looking for a poll where the winner won by more than the polls said, show me where they were predicting a clear Dem win that ended in a win for the GOP.</comment>

<comment>I did the work for you.  Here is the "massive wrongness"  Alaska, Kansas and Maryland went GOP when the polls showed a democratic win.  Alaska was predicting a Dem win by 0.0%, so that's not a large margin of victory.  One state, Connecticut had the winner as GOP, but the Dems won.  So your massive unexpected trouncing of the Democratic party is a net 2 governorships that went GOP when polls said Dem.  Yes, the share of GOP vote was larger than expected, but the result were not.</comment>

<comment>I'm one of the silent and I know plenty more silent people voting for Donald Trump. </comment>

<comment>The obnoxiously noisy minority certainly exists, if that's what you're calling the "silent majority."</comment>

<comment>John Birch Society and the remains of the White Citizens Council.Sorry, it´s not a majority at all.</comment>

<comment>Are they silent in polls? There's no evidence they exist.Also, Trump supporters, silent?</comment>

<comment>LMAO that you think Trump supporters are the silent majority.</comment>

<comment>What silent majority. I have yet to see a national poll that shows him with more than 40% support. If he somehow ends up with the nomination his negatives will drive record Democrat turnout and leave a lot of main stream republicans sitting at home on election day.</comment>

<comment>I think it's safe to say that most American's don't openly talk about politics with strangers, especially pollsters. Who is to say what or who that person on the other end of the line is?</comment>

<comment>While I'm sure that is true of some people, national level polls have been pretty close to the mark in recent presidential elections. I'm not sure why this one would be any different. In the last five presidential elections, the final results were never more than 4% off of the polling.</comment>

<comment>I think it's safe to say there's more than one American.</comment>

<comment>Dems don't vote</comment>

<comment>In non-presidential elections you're right. They seem to turn out in sufficient numbers to win about half of presidential elections though.</comment>

<comment>It's all about the relative positioning of the two candidates. As Trump's rhetoric gets more extreme, Cruz will seem to some voters relatively centrist.That said, I agree with Matt Yglesias that Cruz as GOP nominee would likely do worse in the general than Trump as nominee.http://www.vox.com/2015/12/8/9...And if Trump mounts an independent candidacy after, say, a bitter and brokered GOP convention, the general election will be a bloodbath.</comment>

<comment>There's some truth to that, but it doesn't contradict what I said. I said that the closer Cruz gets to Trump, the less likely he is to win the general. In other words, by hewing close to Trump, Cruz positions himself relatively closer and undercuts the effect you describe.And he's done that by voting against a rider in the Judiciary Committee opposing a ban on Muslims entering the country, and by reiterating his own position instead of condemning Trump. I assume Clinton and her people are keeping track.</comment>

<comment>If Trump waits until the convention in July of 2016 he will have likely missed key ballot deadlines.For example Texas is May 9 and the process will require gathering over 570,000 signatures across all 50 states.None of this can be accomplished AFTER the convention.He will really need to jump into the race as an independent by March to meet all the deadlines.</comment>

<comment>I'm aware of the ballot application schedule, and two months ago would have made an argument similar to yours about the unlikelihood of Trump making an independent run.But the man could do a lot of damage to the party with the late-filing states (there are a quite a few of them) and write-ins. At some point this becomes a matter or mutually assured destruction.</comment>

<comment> - George Washington's Fairwell AddressPerhaps it is time to see the birth of new political parties as the two current ones are failing our modern democracy.</comment>

<comment>In some ways Washington's address must be considered wistful. He had long wished that no political parties would arise in his new nation, but they very quickly did--and in fact he was privately sympathetic and cooperative with Hamilton's Federalists.We both can (and I think do) wish Washington's beliefs were more universally held. But it appears that partisanship is as intrinsic to human nature as tribalism. Would clean-sheet parties do any better?</comment>

<comment>Yes I might want to argue that the GOP has so embraced self-righteous evangelicals and adopted a series of failed economic polices so as to be rendered unintelligible, and the Democrats have been absent from the discussion for so many years as to become a dreamcatcher for liberal voters and the boogeyman for the opposition, but in itself the Democratic party is a toothless, shiftless mess of unintelligible policies that aptly represent nothing at all.The GOP crazy speaks for itself but the Democrats offer such ridiculous policies as by example the homeless care in NYC which has devolved into a game of daring the populace to tolerate an explosion of street people while simultaneously spending $1.1 billion per year on the problem that only grows while spending explodes.Putting this resource spend into better terms, $1.1 billion a year would build whole new subway lines, or other public facilities that would better serve the entire population. But failed Democrats only double-down on demanding more money for a system that has proven rife with corruption, and has seen growth in homeless populations even as spending expanded by 62% in the past 8 years.New York per capita tax collections are higher than any neighboring state, and per the Tax Foundation the state ranks dead last, it is highest taxed state combining corporate, individual, property and sales taxes.It might be fair to say that NYC spends more on it's homeless populations than any other city in the world, and the net result is that in the past two years Grand Central has gone from a public venue for all to enjoy into a public flop house with dozens of people sleeping around and within the structure, including the grand hallways. And the mayor claims its just your imagination, the problem is not getting worse but this ridiculous statement is inconveniently contravened by the anyone simply observing it.The Democratic party has no real solutions, the GOP is stark-raving mad and the sensible electorate is left without a home.</comment>

<comment>But you gotta get through the primary to even think about the general.</comment>

<comment>True. Could be Cruz is being as smart as he can be--and it's still not enough.</comment>

<comment>Can't say that before we know who the nominee is. I think Cruz is running the smartest campaign of them all (Trump too. Disagree with his views, I don't care, you gotta admit he's running his campaign well). Which is good, because he's the candidate I support the most.</comment>

<comment>I disagree Donald Trump will beat out Cruz.</comment>

<comment>or Supreme Court Justice.</comment>

<comment>Or SCOTUS nominee Cruz or VP (nother Cheney)</comment>

<comment>Agreed. I've mentioned the SCOTUS shortlist possibility elsewhere on this page.</comment>

<comment>He's intelligent enough to know foreign citizens, Muslim or otherwise, don't have a birth right to migrate to the United States, which is more than we can say for you.</comment>

<comment>You question Haritoto's intelligence while writing that incomprehensible comment? (". . . don't have a birth to migrate to the United States . . . .")Oh, the irony, the delicious irony.</comment>

<comment>Irony is citing freedom of religion, when no U.S. citizen's or Syrian Refugee's rights would be violated by Trump's proposal, except Syrian refugees left to fend for themselves against ISIS, who happen to be Christian. Now if you can find a way to blame that on the U.S. government, or Donald Trump, you may have some validity. </comment>

<comment>US citizens of Muslim extraction cannot get back into the country once abroad, and that's not violating their rights? A Muslim-specific database, and that's not a violation?Isis is Christian?Whudda maroon!</comment>

<comment>These are straw man arguments. No one suggested Muslims (U.S. citizens) couldn't re-enter the United States if they travel abroad, or the King of Jordan and other heads of states wouldn't be able to visit. At least have an honest discussion.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Trump's campaign did say they would include Muslim citizens living or traveling abroad, so there's that.  At least that's why I assume they meant when they said "everyone."</comment>

<comment>While that is the meaning of "everyone", a Trumpette has to nuance it so it isn't so blatant. Because Trump didn't really say "everyone", even though he did say it. But if you ask, a Trumpette will say he didn't..</comment>

<comment>Sure...What were you watching, MSNBC? LOL</comment>

<comment>Trump has clearly suggested just that.</comment>

<comment>No idiot, IMMIGRANTS, GET IT, IMMIGRANTS...Pause on NEW IMMIGRANTS...</comment>

<comment>Try reading the First Amendment sometime. It is unconstitutional for the government to discriminate on the basis of religion.</comment>

<comment>Oddly we do discriminate against citizens on the bases of race, ever hear of affirmative action? Besides, again we are talking about IMMIGRANTS of all kinds; NOT PROTECTED BY OUR LAWS OR PRIVY TO THEIR PROTECTIONS...You try reading...</comment>

<comment>But discrimination based on religion in immigration would have to be an official government policy, thus bringing it under the First Amendment. Try thinking...</comment>

<comment>Can you point to any case law backing up that claim? I know that the the Constitution covers all the laws crafted by the Congress or enacted by the Government. That means the government may not discriminate on account of religion.</comment>

<comment>Immigration officer "What religion are you?"Muslim immigrant "Christian"Of does Donald have some way of proving that they aren't?  Do we have to strip them down and find their "Up with Jesus" tattoo?</comment>

<comment>There's more than one U.S. citizen.</comment>

<comment>So you admit Cruz is an idiot.  Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Nice 3rd grade response.</comment>

<comment>Your candidate just flunked the Constitution by failing to condemn an unconstitutional policy of discrimination based upon religion.  That helps him suck up to Trump's idiot followers, but guess what?  The rest of the world noticed too.That, my friend, is third grade.You Cruz, you lose.  Go peddle your Cruz crap on Breitbart.</comment>

<comment>Discriminating against who we allow into the country is in the job description of Congress. Foreign citizens, Muslim or otherwise, don't have a birth right to U.S. citizenship, nor should they. Muslim Americans would still be allowed to practice their religion and Syrian Refugees would still be allowed worship Allah abroad under Trump's proposal.</comment>

<comment>You do not understand the First Amendment.  You've got nothing, zero, nada.Discriminating on the basis of religion is unconstitutional.I expect you to keep posting nonsense.  Why?  Because you're a fool.  And fools are the only votes either Cruz or Trump will ever get.</comment>

<comment>You clearly don't understand the Constitution or US law. The First Amendment and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment apply to US citizens and people in the country. It does not apply to foreigners wanting to enter the US.In 1980 Jimmy Carter used his authority under existing law to expel all Iranian nationals and prevent any other immigrants from Iran. No one even batted an eye.</comment>

<comment>Iranian prohibition did not implicate the First Amendment.  It was not a religious ban.The U.S. Supreme Court, in 2008, issued a highly publicized opinion, in Boumediene v. Bush, which, by itself, makes clear how false is the claim that the Constitution applies only to Americans.  The Boumediene Court held that it was unconstitutional for the Military Commissions Act to deny habeas corpus rights to Guantanamo detainees, none of whom was an American citizen (indeed, the detainees were all foreign nationals outside of the U.S.).  If the Constitution applied only to U.S. citizens, that decision would obviously be impossible.  What’s more, although the decision was 5-4, none of the 9 Justices — and, indeed, not even the Bush administration — argued that the Constitution applies only to American citizens.  That is such an inane, false, discredited proposition that no responsible person would ever make that claim.  Yet you do.  Do you claim to have a law degree?You are not even close.  No Constitutional scholar buys this line of crap.  You are firing blanks.</comment>

<comment>I think you misunderstand Boumediene. The issue was whether someone held at Guantanamo should be treated as though he is in the US. The Court held that, although Guantanamo is not part of the US, we exercise de facto sovereignty over it and thus a prisoner has the same habeas rights as he would have if he were held in a prison in the US.You are correct that people, not just citizens, who are in the country enjoy Constitutional rights. But someone in Syria, for example, has no rights at all under US law. He would have no First Amendment rights to violate. He can be excluded from entering the US for any reason, even one that appears to implicate religious freedom. Put another way, he would have no standing to sue for violation of a constitutional right because he has none.Of course, such a policy is un-American. It just probably isn't unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>Dude that case is well beyond your comprehension and did not set any  precedent for claiming constitutional protections for foreign citizens outside our purview! Even more alarming are all the fellow idiots upping your stupidity blindly...Bumper sticker ideology I tell you!</comment>

<comment>You are a moron.</comment>

<comment>Guantanamo is a US military base thus subject to US jurisdiction. Plus these were prisoners being held by US authorities. That case has nothing to do with immigration.Bottom line is the Constitution does not apply to foreigners outside of US jurisdiction.</comment>

<comment>Flat out false.</comment>

<comment>Clearly you have demonstrated you are a new arrival with a very limited understanding of the English language or the rule of law...</comment>

<comment>not even important - like all laws the american constitution should be reworked to accommodate nationalismwhy you people still worship that piece of paper is truly a mystery</comment>

<comment>For obvious reasons, it's solely responsible for this country and all that have come after in many  ways...</comment>

<comment>And you moron don't seem to understand what is being discussed, NON CITIZENS...</comment>

<comment>I love how Cruz and Trump supporters suggest this about the rights of foreigners, when it is really about Constitutional structure and the wall between church and state that protects all American citizens.Freedom is dangerous. Freedom to have guns is dangerous. Freedom to drink alcohol is dangerous. Freedom of religion is dangerous.</comment>

<comment>This incomprehensible comment reinforces the left's apparent failure to understand the basic principles of the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>It's only incomprehensible to someone that fails to understand the Constitution and the price of freedom which you have grown tired of paying. Now you wish to trade it for security.</comment>

<comment>You clearly don't understand the Constitution or US law. The First Amendment and the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment apply to US citizens and people in the country. It does not apply to foreigners wanting to enter the US.In 1980 Jimmy Carter used his authority under existing law to expel all Iranian nationals and prevent any other immigrants from Iran.</comment>

<comment>You clearly don't understand Constitutional law, because you're not even arguing against the Supreme Court's arguments.You clearly don't understand what's going on because you're arguing on the wrong side of the field even after I told you.</comment>

<comment>You clearly have serious mental problems.</comment>

<comment>It only seems that way because you're ignorant of Constitutional law and don't believe what I'm telling you, so you think I'm crazy.</comment>

<comment>Jimmy Carter did not expel "all" Iranians. In fact, more Iranians immigrated to the US during that time as refugees. The only ones deported were those who had blatantly violated their student visas.Nor was this an action taken against a religion. It was nation specific.</comment>

<comment>Tutoring may help that incomprehension of yours.</comment>

<comment>They  have no real understanding of anything...Like bumper sticker mantra's and reasons to piss away and afternoon...</comment>

<comment>There's more than one mantra.</comment>

<comment>You miss the simple point - what religious test would determine a Muslim from any other person entering the country, and by what Government authority would the Constitution allow for the creation of a religious screening authority?</comment>

<comment>Are you questioning his intelligence or his right to migrate? And who the hell is we?</comment>

<comment>"He doesn't agree with me. HE IZ STOOPIDS". That's what you sound like.</comment>

<comment>Here's Ted Cruz once again proving that he is running the smartest campaign of anyone in this race.  There are nine Republicans opposing Trump's "plan," all of them splitting up the "establishment" GOP vote.  By basically sitting out the issue, Cruz separates himself from the crowd and continues to make himself the logical landing spot for the moron vote after Trump fades away.  It is tempting to say that Cruz is the frontrunner for the GOP nomination at this point, but the problem is that no one likes Ted Cruz.  He is just so personally repugnant, from his hectoring speaking style to his unique willingness to throw any fellow Republican under the bus at any time to advance his career.  Still, he's a smart guy running a smart campaign.As for the other Republicans in the Senate who did not vote against the Trump plan, this is symbolic of the immense harm that Trump continues to do to the Republican party.  The (white nationalist) far right is so ascendant in the party right now that regular politicians are afraid to oppose even such an obviously bigoted and impractical idea as a religious test for people entering the U.S.  To understand the full scope of the disaster, just consider that Trump - the overwhelming leader in the GOP polls - was recently called "the real deal" by one of America's leading neo-Nazis (http://www.telesurtv.net/engli....</comment>

<comment>It's not just whites, 42% of all the people want the Muslims out. </comment>

<comment>Liberals don't like facts.</comment>

<comment>Facts are racist.</comment>

<comment>I like facts! For instance, there is the fact that 42% < 58%.  That's a pretty good fact.And there's also the fact that keludel hasn't cited his data.  Another good fact.</comment>

<comment>Bull.</comment>

<comment>42% you think? Sometimes wonder if the US is quite ready for democracy yet!</comment>

<comment></comment>

<comment>What's the source for this?  "...want the Muslims out" is a very general and broad statement.  No pollster would be stupid enough to ask a question that way -- the answers would be meaningless -- and it would be equally misleading and inaccurate to summarize the responses to a well worded poll question that way.</comment>

<comment>Nope.According to an NBC poll, 57 percent of all Americans oppose Trump's plan. 25 percent support it and 14 percent had no opinion.http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-th...(Here's where you'll say something like "Liberal poll! Doesn't count!", hmm?):</comment>

<comment>A Rasmussen poll showed 64% of Republicans and 46% of all voters approved of Trump's proposal.  MSNBC polled their own audience and the approvals were large majorities from every ethnic group.</comment>

<comment>“What the hell is Monmouth? I only like polls that treat me well.” -- Donald Trump, after a Monmouth University Poll showed him losing his number one position in Iowa to Ted CruzWell, nice try with the cherry picking of polls. And that you think that the NBC poll was made up of "large majorities from every ethnic group" is very revealing (but at least you've learned something from Trump, hmm?).Though I'm sure you could care less, the Rasmussen poll purposely skewed their poll by prefacing the Muslim immigrant question with the leading "Is it too easy or too hard for foreigners to legally enter the United States?" After you ask that, getting a coherent answer from the poll is impossible. They might have well as asked, "Do you think foreigners are are beating their wives too much?"http://www.rasmussenreports.co...(And I TOTALLY called it that you would just reply, "Liberal poll!")</comment>

<comment>@Keludel -- this means you.  What's your source?</comment>

<comment>Trump/Cruz 2016- they compliment each other so well! </comment>

<comment>I thought you cared about Trump!? Then pray it will never happen. Trump would need extra Secret Service protection. Cruz is ruthless. Boris and Fred are explaining it well on this thread. Cruz knows Trump is toast, and knows he cannot appeal to many in his own party, so he is trying to position himself for the day when Trumpster meets the dumpster.</comment>

<comment>I think the party might also find it convenient to get Cruz out of the Senate. He's generally hated by his fellow GOP senators, even those of the populist right wing. His temperament is not well suited to getting anything done in legislative setting, anyway, so he has no future there.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is effeminate but other than that? We populists love him</comment>

<comment>I believe you mean Lindsey. </comment>

<comment>A little too light in the loafers?</comment>

<comment>Surely you jest Rhett ;-)</comment>

<comment>Dude, I think he's effeminate. To each their own. I</comment>

<comment>I don't see it. Don't call me dude- silly. </comment>

<comment>Effeminate? I don't see it, either.There is, however, a striking resemblance to a famous American closet case:http://papaoftheyear.com/separ...</comment>

<comment>A younger version perhaps. Surely people are not saying he's effeminate. I've only heard that about Lindsey (seems nice though). Cruz is my 2nd choice </comment>

<comment>I wouldn't be at all surprised. He is roundly detested.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is the most unappealing person in the race, and I would feel that way even if he agreed with me 100% politically.</comment>

<comment>Why?</comment>

<comment>His naked ambition, his grandstanding, his speaking style, the fact that people who know him personally all seem to loath him, his smug facial expressions, his obvious pandering, etc.</comment>

<comment>All superficial stuff. Liberals are more cosmetic oriented than me- a female ha - seems odd. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>S_L is not really female.</comment>

<comment>By who? About Cruz?</comment>

<comment>There's nothing superficial about not wanting to elect someone who cynically grandstands while other congressman are trying to pass a budget and address budgetary shortfalls.He's universally loathed on both sides of the aisle by people who actually attempt to govern the country.And, as I've noted before, he's a total fraud.  He's a Bush administration insider posing as an outsider.  He was a "compassionate conservative" when that was popular, and "tea partier" when that became popular.  Now he's a Trump clone because, you guessed it, that's popular.This is not to mention the fact that he lives in a house bought by Goldman Sachs money while riding a wave of discontent about financial sector bailouts.  Y'all are complete suckers if you support Cruz.  Even more so than supporting Trump.</comment>

<comment>Where's the home for someone who cares about the Constitution? Not just the Second Amendment, but the First, and the Fourth and the Fourteenth? Not with Trump, certainly. Not with Cruz either at this rate. He had me going there briefly on foreign policy, but...</comment>

<comment>What?!  SCOTUS has plopped all over the Constitution - you HAVE no home.</comment>

<comment>What Constitutional amendment is Cruz violating? The Constitution is a contract between the government and American citizens. It does not protect immigrants.</comment>

<comment>Where do you see the word "citizen" inAny law that would prohibit someone from something solely on the basis of religion would be a flagrant violation of the 1st Amendment.</comment>

<comment>"The people" means the American people. It does not refer to every person on the planet. Aliens do not have the same relationship with the Constitution as the American people do. Our government can't make aliens pay income taxes either.</comment>

<comment>Pssst.... might want to read this.Because, you know... you're wrong.Also, and you really made a bad decision bringing up taxes to a tax lawyer, the US can, absolutely, tax non-residents. If they're here more than 183 days in a year, they become US residents for tax purposes. Moreover, any US sourced income may have withholding taxes prior to being paid out to foreign persons.</comment>

<comment>Well, the 14th Amendment specifically states "No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."Notice that "within its jurisdiction" part?I guess I was wrong in saying the Constitution doesn't apply to aliens in general the same way it does to citizens. But aliens outside the country don't seem to have the same rights as we do, at least in the eyes of our Law of the Land.Also, I'm not sure that "the people" and "persons" refer to the same people. "Persons" seem to be individuals in general. "Citizens" seem to be individual American citizens. And "the people" seems to be the American politic as a whole. The blog you sent crudely assumes that "the people" means "persons". Notice the "the" in "the people" every time which seems to refer to a singular group instead of simply "people" which is more general.</comment>

<comment>Wow, so I guess I'm going to have to explain the fundamental constitutional principles of this country to you. Listen up, because you're getting at least a $5,000 value for free, or... you could take a constitutional law class.The 14th Amendment is applicable to the states. It is not applicable to the federal government. The proposed action is a federal action. Therefore, in no way, shape or form, is the 14th Amendment invoked.Moreover, you don't have to bring up the 14th Amendment or the 5th Amendment (which is applicable to the federal government), because the cause of action would accrue under the 1st Amendment and the vehicle for bringing suit would be 42 U.S.C. 1983.It's axiomatic that aliens outside the country aren't subject to our laws. However, when they come into the country, they get certain rights and privileges. They don't get all of them, because they're not citizens, but they get a fair few. For example, they get the right to habeas corpus review as determined by the Supreme Court in Boumediene v. Bush.I hope you learned a little about your own country and its laws today.</comment>

<comment>I see.So I totally nailed it when I said that "the people" refers to "the American people" and not "all the people in the world"?</comment>

<comment>No, in fact, you completely screwed it up. How you even think you're right is baffling.You literally got it completely wrong. People refers to any single entity that the Supreme Court has determined "people" refers to, like citizens, aliens, immigrants, corporations, etc....It's sad that I have to explain the fundamentals of the American legal system to, I'm assuming, Americans.Your words are an indictment of the American educational system.</comment>

<comment>Okay. A few things I've learned and a few things I want to clarify:1. The religious test would "respect an establishment of religion", so it's definitely unconstitutional, period. It doesn't matter what we're talking about, the government can't recognize a religion.2. The 14th Amendment is a limit on state power, not federal power (I knew that, but threw out a poor example too frivolously).3. I screwed up by saying "the American people" in my last comment. I should have said "the people living in America". But that would only be relevant to this topic if the government were allowed to respect an establishment of religion.4. The meaning of "the people" seems to be a bit contentious in general (this paper agrees with you, but it doesn't seem to be a consensus)http://harvardlawreview.org/wp...5. Thanks for explaining some of this stuff. We need to bring back civics classes.</comment>

<comment>We absolutely do need to bring back civics. If you want a disturbing example of the most fundamental concept in constitutional law and the public's complete lack of understanding of it, just ask anyone who's a non-lawyer the following:To whom, in the context of enforcement, does the U.S. Constitution apply? I.E., as a person, can I sue both public and private entities for alleged constitutional violations.Most people think the constitution applies to private and public. Most people are wrong. That's just a single misunderstanding. I could go on all day.</comment>

<comment>Can you go a bit further with that point? That sounds important, but I don't get it. I have zero background in law.Keep fighting the good fight. But maybe try to be slightly gentler lol. You can make a huge difference in people's lives and for the country.</comment>

<comment>I can indeed. Here's where it came up somewhat recently and made me want to smack my head into my desk.Do you remember when the Duck Dynasty guy said something about gay people insofar as they shouldn't get married or whatever? Then A&E (that was the channel, right? or maybe Discovery.... doesn't matter) suspended the show or fired the guy or something like that, citing what he said. People then started saying that the channel (A&E or whomever) was violating his 1st Amendment rights. That is a literal impossibility.The Constitution, insofar as actions it protects against, only applies to state actors (one caveat is the 13th Amendment prohibiting slavery, that applies to both state and private actors, but it's the only amendment that does). State actors are governments, officials, basically, public employees and entities. The bill of rights apply to the federal government through the 5th Amendment Due Process Clause. All of the first ten amendments apply to the federal government. However, only those amendments that have been incorporated into the 14th Amendment apply to the states. So, for example, in Heller (2010), the Supreme Court, for the first time in US history, incorporated the 2nd Amendment into the 14th, meaning a citizen could sue a state for violation of his or her 2nd Amendment rights. Prior to 2010, that was an impossibility. I can't remember off the top of my head all the amendments not incorporated, but I know the 3rd (no quarter soldiers) and the 7th (right to jury trial in a civil proceeding) have not.So, let's take another example. I own a restaurant, it's 100% private, and therefore, the Constitution can never apply to me. So, insofar as the Constitution is concerned, I could hang a sign outside my restaurant saying, "No Blacks Allowed." However, because of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, I cannot do that. It's not unconstitutional, it's illegal under federal law. Congress enacted that through it's Commerce Clause powers.Basically, the Commerce Clause says that Congress can regulate interstate commerce. There was a case called Katzenbach v. McClung in which a restaurant that prohibited blacks sued the government saying that the Civil Rights Act was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court held that it was a valid use of Congress' Commerce Clause powers because the denial of blacks affected interstate commerce insofar as the restaurant was off a highway, dealt with people who were spending money in the stream of commerce, etc....So, there's a fairly quick overview. Please, feel free to ask more questions. I was a federal district court law clerk drafting judicial decisions on constitutional matters for two years. I love talking constitutional law.</comment>

<comment>Good stuff. After your previous post, I was thinking of Anthony Cumia getting fired by Sirius for his tweets. I remember people talking about the First Amendment but thinking "Sirius is not the government!" lol.Based off your anecdote about a "No Blacks Allowed" sign:One basic rule I think private business owners should be allowed to follow is "any private business should be allowed to deny service to any customer for any reason." Would the commerce clause powers nullify that as an inalienable right for a private citizen? Is it the sign the problem? Or are the actions of the business owner the problem?Also, how is the Department of Ed. justified? Since the 10th Amendment states that powers not specifically enumerated to the feds by the Constitution are reserved to the states and people respectively, what gives the federal government the right to regulate education? Not to mention Obamacare and all of our welfare programs...</comment>

<comment>Well, business can't break federal law. You can deny service to someone for any number of reasons, but those reasons cannot violate the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and any other applicable law. Allowing anything else would allow a business to, for example, deny blacks service. That's segregation, no matter how you cut it. That is illegal, and should be. However, if you want to deny business to people who support Trump, you can, as those are not a protected class. The difference is, one is an immutable characteristic that people shouldn't be prejudged on, the other is an ideology which people should be judged on (at least in my opinion).Next, the Dept. of Ed. doesn't mandate educational changes, they tie funding to them. That's perfectly legal as, to use the Supreme Court's words, it doesn't "commandeer the state legislature." So, the Dept. of Ed. says, if you want Title I funds, you have to do X, Y, and Z. If you don't want to do X, Y, and Z, that's fine, but you get no money.Healthcare is easy. It's obviously interstate commerce, therefore Congress has the right to regulate it. Further, the Supreme Court ruled that the individual mandate was a tax and not a penalty, therefore, under the Taxing and Spending clause of the Constitution, Congress can tax and spend for the general welfare. Also, welfare is completely done by the state. They use federal money, but it's administered by the states. When you apply for welfare, you don't apply to the federal government, you apply to the state in which you live. The welfare benefits very from state to state.In my mind, the 10th Amendment needs to be repealed as states tend to be far more corrupt with much less accountability than the federal government. Moreover, it's the states, not typically the feds, that are gung ho about violating constitutional rights. You can thank the south for the 14th Amendment. At one point the constitution protected the citizens from the federal government, but now, if you look at federal court dockets, most of the constitutional litigation typically involves a citizen claiming a state actor (as in from the state, not federal government) is violating their constitutional rights.</comment>

<comment>Okay, I disagree with a lot of that from an ideological standpoint.What you're promoting is fundamentally different from what the founders intended, right? The way the Supreme Court interprets federal involvement in education and healthcare is more activist than in the spirit of our founding principles, right?You think it should be okay to discriminate against a political ideology but not a religious ideology? What's the logic behind that?When it comes to states violating Constitutional rights, didn't we just go over the fact that there is a separation of powers? Some amendments in the Constitution limit the federal government, and others (namely the 14th) limit the states' powers? Do you think gun control laws in the states are a violation of our basic rights? I wonder how many of the court dockets you mentioned have to do with the Second Amendment. Do you have any info on that?I disagree with repealing the 10th Amendment strongly. I think it's one of the most important amendments we have. If we were Sweden or Japan and had a very homogeneous culture and society, I wouldn't care about it. But we have people from so many walks of life and lifestyles. It seems like a good idea to have 50 places to choose from, plus more local government power so we can actually participate in self-governance.</comment>

<comment>No, actually, Alexander Hamilton, who basically set up the entire country and was really the architect of the government was in favor of all that I've said. It was only Jefferson, who was rather ignorant and scared of a large government (and of course, being a wealthy person with no need for government intervention, why wouldn't he?) wanted strong states and a weak centralized government. The problem is, at no point in history has a democratic republic ever worked. Ever. It is a horrific form of government which leads to the inevitable mass corruption at state level. Further, the economic disparity between states as well as social issues gets exacerbated when the states are left to their own devices.Just look at major Supreme Court precedent over the last century. Most of it is reigning in the utter corruption and discrimination led by the states.In terms of discrimination against political ideology, I'm fine with that, I'm also fine with discriminating against religious ideology insofar as anyone who is religious is automatically marked down in my book as foolish. I don't think the government should discriminate, but on a personal level, I'm happy to discriminate against religious people, mostly because I think they're idiots who believe in fairytales from the bronze age. But, again, religious discrimination is unconstitutional, political is not.I don't think any gun control law is a violation of the 2nd Amendment unless the actual amendment is complied with. The thing that gun nuts forget is, there's an entire clause that conditions gun ownership on involvement in a "well regulated militia." The Supreme Court has perverted that phrase to mean nothing, but if you read Hamilton's Federalist Paper No. 28 or 29 (I forget which), he quite clearly defines "well regulated militia" to mean a state run militia, like a state guard. Even the Supreme Court in Heller said that the 2nd Amendment has limits. All that decision did was say that DC couldn't ban handguns in the home, that's it. Well, that and it incorporated the 2nd Amendment in the 14th. But, even Scalia, the worst Supreme Court Justice in recent history, unequivocally stated the 2nd Amendment, as all amendments, has limits.The 10th Amendment is not needed. We have courts, we have legislatures, we have many ways of dealing with things that aren't granting little, corrupt fiefdoms. Look at, for example, gay marriage. Two thirds of the country was on board with gay marriage, but you had holdout backwards states that love discriminating against people, who didn't want to follow Supreme Court law!. Eliminating the 10th Amendment would eliminate the 7 year legal process it takes to get from filing a lawsuit to the Supreme Court decision.Actually, I'd support splitting the country up into the United States of the Coasts (i.e., the west coast and North East) and leave every other state to fail on its own. The GDP of the country mainly comes from the coasts, while the remnants of the country are the taker states. Those states are the same states that prevent us from having nice things, better technology, etc..., all in the name of being conservative and greedy. Why does a Senator oppose Net Neutrality, something that benefits every single consumer as well as almost every business? Because a large ISP bought off that Senator. Why does a state want to ban municipal fiber? Because an ISP bought off the legislature. Why do congressional republicans insist that the FCC doesn't have the authority to regulate the internet? Because the ISPs bought off Republicans. I'm not saying Democrats are innocent. Hillary's involvement with Wall Street is very concerning. But, here's another example. Why is the carried interest loophole still in existence? Because Wall St. bought off enough of Congress to keep it in there. At the local level it's even worse because there's virtually no accountability. I've worked for state governments, the corruption is out of this world. I've worked for the federal government. There is far less nepotism and corruption.</comment>

<comment>Well, I respect your opinion. But we are coming from very different places. You certainly know your stuff and have taught me quite a bit, but I disagree with a lot of your conclusions.On religious vs. political discrimination, I see that the law does not protect political groups as classes. But from a fair, objective point of view, what's the difference? Both are belief systems. I think it takes a lot more faith to believe in something like Communism than it does in Christianity. The whole Western World with all of its advancements and innovation took place alongside Judeo-Christian beliefs and values. All of the best and most successful nations on the planet are rooted in Western, Judeo-Christian systems. But Communism? That's been an absolute catastrophe throughout the past century. So which takes more faith to be believe in? I don't see how the two are that different. If a man believes God is above him, why is he worse than someone who believes equality or the state is above him?Can you give me some examples of "utter corruption by the states" in the past century?On the Second Amendment, being in the militia is not a prerequisite for owning a gun. The Amendment says that since we need a militia, the government can't infringe upon our rights to keep and bear arms. It doesn't say "you can own a gun if you're in the militia".On gay marriage and Supreme Court decisions, we're not a straight-up Democracy or ruled by one set of judges. The country was not founded to function through tyranny by the majority or to be ruled by the Supreme Court. Would you make that argument if two-thirds of the country wanted the EPA to be shut down? Or if two-thirds of the country wanted to ban immigration in its entirety? When it comes to gay marriage specifically, why is the federal government involved in marriage at all? I see the states as protection from the Supreme Court just legislating from the bench. If Trump or Christie get elected and appoint a bunch of Scalia's as judges, are you going to want us to be at their mercy? Or would you like the states to be able to function in their own way?I don't think we should split the country in two, but I definitely think we need more states rights. You should be careful about wanting to split us in two because the "taker states" might raise the price of oil and food for their neighbors quite a bit. They'd also have a Keystone Pipeline to up the cash flow a bit. lol</comment>

<comment>Wait, it takes more faith to believe in communism than Christianity? I'm not sure I buy that. Communism, in theory, could work. There are economic principles at play that we can measure and estimate. Christianity has no basis in reality and no tangible proof whatsoever. Communism requires faith insofar as believing people would put aside their greed to work towards a better community. Christianity (or any deity based religion) requires believing in magic and products of delusion and fantasy (usually due to undiagnosed mental illness and STD's).Just look at the local level of politics for corruption. It's off the charts. I had one friend who worked on Republican campaigns at the local level. He said, it doesn't matter what party you're in, the local politicians and parties just trade favors, as in, "if put up a loser against my guy, I'll let your other guy run unopposed for this other election." Corruption, plain and simple. There's myriad examples, that's just one off the top of my head. You could also look to the major corruption reform in New York because Albany was extremely corrupt. So corrupt in fact that the United States Attorney's Office is constantly investigating politicians here.The Second Amendment states:A normal person reads that as two clauses, the first being "a well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state" and "the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed." The second clause is predicated on the first, not the other way around. In the context of the founding of the US, reading the 1st clause as predicated on the 2nd makes no sense. The founders are saying, basically, because we need to make sure the state is free from oppression, and a well regulated militia is the means to that end, the people have the right to bear arms. It makes absolutely no sense, contextually, to read it backwards. Think about it: People have the right to bear arms and... incidentally, well regulated militias are necessary to stave off oppression. No, the right to bear arms is predicated on forming well regulated militias intended to prevent oppression. That's the only reading that makes sense. If you're not a gun nut, you don't have to perform mental gymnastics to make sense of the amendment. However, when you put ideology over plain meaning, it requires you to perform quite impressive mental gymnastics to arrive at a conclusion that supports your ideology.You seem to not understand what a Democratic Republic is. A Democratic Republic is majority rule but the minority is protected from the tyranny of the majority. For example the majority of the population, at some point, either supported or didn't have negative feelings towards slavery. Does that make it right? Should we have slavery? No, because our Constitution prevents the minority from being terrorized by the majority simply because they are lesser in number. The Supreme Court is here to interpret the Constitution. They do not legislate from the bench. In fact, that is wholly forbidden by the Constitution and has never happened in the course of US history. The Supreme Court interprets the Constitution or statute. That's it. If the legislature doesn't like the Supreme Court's interpretation, they're free to write an amendment or change the statute. The Supreme Court is the protection against discriminatory laws, typically passed by the states. The legislatures don't need protecting from the Supreme Court. If they do they're job correctly, the Supreme Court is never involved.As for the taker states having the oil, well... I hate to tell you this, but consumer automobiles and probably most commercial autos (trucks, etc...) will be using electricity or hydrogen. Oil is on its way out. It's unsustainable and killing the planet. So, the oil producing states can keep their dwindling revenues. I'm much more comfortable in joining forces with the states driving clean energy (CA and NY). As for food, we actually import a lot of food. NY produces a lot of grain. The coasts produce a lot of fruits, vegetables, and seafood. I'm good with that. The taker states can keep their red meat and fried goods.  You might just want to peruse this Wikipedia article regarding life expectancy by state. The tl;dr is, not living in a taker state may increase your lifespan by an average of 6 years. That's about an 8% increase in lifespan. I think us non-taker states will be just fine.</comment>

<comment>Christianity has worked. Western society is a result of Judeo-Christian values. Regardless of superstition and fables, the 10 Commandments and the general morality of the Bible have led to some of the most important achievements of mankind. I'm not saying that it's been perfect and that there aren't extremists and lunatics associated with Christianity, but would you rather live and raise a family in a nation with Judeo-Christian heritage or something else? The crusades were like an eternity ago.Communism (which is always Atheist, mind you) has slaughtered hundreds of millions over the course of the past century and caused mass starvation and poverty. I would say that getting people to believe that they are special and will go to heaven forever if they are good (as Christianity does) is far more plausible than getting people to act against their own self-interest with no incentives (as Communism demands at gunpoint).I'm very comfortable with my position on that one.I think you are lawyering and rationalizing your personal ideology more than you are understanding the founding principles of the country. The concept of America is that the government's powers come from us. We do not belong to the government (as the DNC suggested during the 2012 elections https://www.youtube.com/watch?..., the government is allowed to exist to serve us. We have self-evident, inalienable, God-given rights, and the Constitution was written to keep the government at bay. It is not the government's responsibility to protect us from ourselves or to keep us alive as long as it can. Its job is to keep foreign and domestic threats from impeding upon our freedoms or threatening our rights. The Second Amendment was written to make sure the government wouldn't get any cute ideas (which hasn't worked thanks to the politeness and tolerance of the heartland).Here is what the founders and framers (including Mr. Hamilton) had to say about the Second Amendment:http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/wew...Remember, freedom of speech does not come from the poet. Freedom of the press does not come from the journalist. And freedom of religion does not come from the preacher. Freedom comes from the soldier. And in a nation of free men, that's you. I'm pretty sure the Founders would have started shooting at government buildings decades ago.Oil is on its way out? lolWe will be predominantly reliant upon fossil fuels for more generations than we can conceive of (probably forever). The next best bets are natural gas and nuclear power. Solar, wind, and hydrogen are failed technologies. The only reason they are relevant is because governments are manipulating the market at the expense of the people. Those technologies are inefficient, unreliable, and expensive. You would have to get people to act out of their own self-interest for the sake of the planet (a big stone which we have no control over) to get off of fossil fuels. People don't care. Fracking and nuclear energy are solid alternatives, but fossil fuels will always be the way to go.On state level corruption, that was not a very compelling argument. Hearsay doesn't hold up in court (even I know that). A good example of municipal government corruption would be the Democrats in Detroit. They are basically the mafia.Then again, how bad could local government corruption be? What are they gonna do? The federal government is the body that can do us real harm. Historically, has there been a greater slayer of human life than central government, particularly in large countries like ours? How many people have died from cancer? Mao killed 70 million.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, but our country is in no way founded on judeo-christian values. Jefferson, Madison, and many other founders explicitly stated that fact. One of the most famous being:Communism has no relation to atheism. Communism is an economic philosophy. Atheism is the lack of a belief in a deity. They are no more related than saying that every Christian is also a pedophile because there seems to be a proclivity between priests molesting children. You need to educate yourself on Communism. While Marx was an atheist and wasn't a fan of religion, communism does not require atheism and I'd venture to guess that the number of atheists who identify as communists would be a statistical blip, if that. Communism could work if people put aside their greed. The only way religion could be true is if the laws of physics suddenly didn't apply. Which one do you think is more realistic? I'll give you a hint, the laws of physics have always applied for approximately 14.6 billion years.You might want to do some more research on your predictions of clean energy. Here's just one article proving you wrong. A .39 second google search for "clean energy overtake fossil fuel" will result in 145,000 sources. Here's another article stating that clean energy will overtake fossil fuels by 2035 (that's 20 years, which is in no way and by no definition a "generation.").Actually, there's many hearsay exceptions in the federal rules of evidence. The one that would apply to that would be a statement against interest. As a member of the Republican party who engaged in election issues, stating that they trade elections based on nothing more than favors, that's most definitely a statement against interest and admissible under Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3), assuming the declarant was unavailable. In this case, because there could be possible criminal charges for electioneering, the 5th Amendment would make the declarant "unavailable" for hearsay purposes.Obviously centralized governments can do more damage merely because they control more substantial things, like the military and they set national policy. However, how many people have unnecessarily died because they couldn't afford health insurance in a place like Texas where they refused to expand Medicaid to cover the gap under the ACA? Since Texas has the highest uninsured rate in the nation, I'd imagine that number is much larger than anyone should be comfortable with.So, to sum up:The United States was not founded on Christianity or christian values (insofar as the values are specifically christian).Communism does not require atheism, and even if it did, it'd still be more likely to come to fruition than anything religious.Fossil fuels will likely be replaced by 2035 as the number one energy source.There's a hearsay exception for what I stated.While large governments can cause massive loss of life, so can state and local governments.Seriously, all that information was freely available on Google and definitively proved you wrong. You really need to do a better job sourcing your information.</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying that the country was straight-up intended to be founded specifically on the Christian religion. Obviously it wasn't. But the founders read the Bible (Jefferson rewrote it without all the miracles), and they had Judeo-Christian backgrounds and Judeo-Christian values whether they say it explicitly or not. My point is that the renaissance and the enlightenment occurred in the West (the Judeo-Christian part of the world) and have yet to occur anywhere else, and the values the Founders and our country have are more closely aligned with Christianity than anything else.I didn't say that all Atheists are Communists. However, all (forgive the hyperbole) Communists are Atheists. Marx hated religion (opiate of the masses), Mao banned religion, Stalin banned religion, Pol Pot banned religion, Castro made Atheism the religion of Cuba, and religion is discouraged in North Korea. You yourself seem to be an avowed Atheist, and you are apologizing for Communism. A person of faith (particularly Judeo-Christian faith) will almost certainly not be a Communist (think of the religious right vs. the secular left). If you believe that life has inherent value and that man is free (again, regardless of all the miracles of the Bible), you're not going to reason that man should be a subject of the state and forced into "equality". I myself am not religious, but I believe in the self-evident rights the Founders realized. I have faith in my rights, and I can't fathom the idea of Communism.You know the 10 Commandments don't require any sort of prayer or worship or sacrifice? It's just a really comprehensive list of things that you shouldn't do and a few things you should. And they are all justifiable in a morally objectivist manner.Also, saying "Communism could work if people put aside their greed" is like saying breathing underwater could work if people put aside their lungs. Greed is what keeps us alive. Greed is what builds the economy. Greed is a great thing. If it weren't for greed, we would not live the privileged, comfortable, and civilized lives we are living today. We'd be in a despotic dystopia like all the Communist societies in history. And those people didn't put away their greed. The governments forced them into a pathetic existence.These energy articles don't support your claim. They have clickbait headlines, but they don't support those headlines. From the article in Discovery:"For non-transportation purposes, clean energy solutions like wind and solar should be firmly established globally by the year 2035, says John Orr, director of the Sustainable Energy Project Center atWorcester Polytechnic Institute.'However, there is nothing on the horizon that, in 20 years, could provide the needed energy density for air transportation and a substantial amount of terrestrial transportation other than liquid fuels,' Orr says. 'And nothing that in that time period could enable us to make a sufficient volume of synthetic liquid fuels.'"They disregard maybe the most common and massively used form of fossil fuel in the headline: gasoline to power vehicles. And how do you think all of the equipment, manpower and other resources get to the renewable energy plants? Do they travel through electric currents, or do they drive huge, gas-guzzling trucks?The second article is claiming that because more renewable energy plants are being added, that renewables are beating fossil fuels. Ummm... what about all the energy production that already exists? lolThe article also destroys its headline with that chart showing how much needs to be spent and how much is being spent. The demand for funding is clearly outpacing the supply of cash stolen from people and debt incurred. These environmentalist jerkoffs are willing to push impoverished people to the brink of survival and to destroy our economies and standards of living for the sake of their God, The Environment. The funny thing is that none of this will make a difference. The government, Hollywood, the media, and academia have been duped. Fortunately, the business world still has brains. Thank God for corporations and Capitalism, our only hopes. http://www.nationalreview.com/...Look how much the world needs fossil fuels. It is a joke to claim that we won't at some point in our existence or the existence of our great, great, great, great grandkids.http://data.worldbank.org/indi...As I said earlier, it is not the government's job to keep us alive. It's their job to prevent other people from killing us, but not to keep us alive like a bunch of sea monkeys. Your claim about Texas is conjecture, and if people didn't like Texas, they wouldn't be moving their in droves. http://www.ijreview.com/2015/0...Conversely, Democratic states and their mentally challenged, tax-ourselves-into-prosperity approaches are losing their human livestock.http://www.cnbc.com/2015/06/22...My rebuttal to your summation:-True, the United States was not explicitly founded on Christianity. But the Founders obviously had Judeo-Christian heritage, and the American value system resembles Judeo-Christian values far more closely than any other religion (and are completely juxtaposed to the religion of Communism).-History tells us that Communism essentially requires Atheism. I've never met a Communist sympathizer who goes to church nor maybe even one that believes in God. Communism has failed massively and violently, while religion (more so Judeo-Christian types than others) has taken man out of the food chain, given us morality, and resulted in our advanced society today.-Your claim about energy is absolutely untrue. There may be wild predictions out there, but there is no way to say that we will not be heavily dependent on fossil fuels forever. You either lied or completely misunderstood what you read.-I'll take your word for it that hearsay is sometimes allowed, but you still haven't condemned local government very well. And I'd like to know how many of the local government rights violations you speak of have to do with the Second Amendment.-Local governments can not cause massive loss of life. When has that happened? Central governments have caused inconceivable loss of life. 70 million in China, 30 million in the USSR, 11 million in the Holocaust alone, Pol Pot killed millions, the Ottamans killed a million and a half, the Kim Jungs have killed a million and a half, and that's just the big ones. There are many more. (P.S.- the examples I mentioned occurred in the past 100 years alone)http://www.scaruffi.com/politi...You are very knowledgeable when it comes to the law, but you need to challenge your worldview. It'll make you a lot happier. Go back and read some of the things you said to me at the start of this conversation. Very snotty, and very angry.</comment>

<comment>Um... you should go back and reread what i wrote and your quotes on energy. At no point did I say clean energy would replace air transportation. But cars? Every major car manufacturer is trying to compete with Tesla. Internal combustion cars will be a thing of the past within 20 years. That's reality.As for atheists and communists, it's not axiomatic. It may be true sometimes or even a majority of the time, but it is not a requirement.You need to work on your reading comprehension. Judo-christian ethics pervade our laws, but they absolutely did not invent these types of ethics. These types of ethical guidelines have existed throughout humanity. Want a good example? Rome? That predated christianity by about 2000 years. These "ethics" developed through evolution. It's beneficial to create a society where there's mutual respect and help for the greater good. The more looking to protect their tribe and see the tribe become successful, the more likely those people were to continue to live. Thus, they reproduced and passed on those values. It's evolution, not religion, sorry.As for the 10 Commandments: One of them is not to worship false idols. Yeah, that's pretty damn religious if you ask me. Find a similar requirement in secular law. Go ahead, I'll wait.You understand that the countries with the highest taxes are also the countries with the best qualities of life and happiest citizens, right? Just go ahead and take a look at any Scandinavian country. Public services aren't free. The rich shouldn't be the only ones who get police protection and medical treatment. Again, this goes back to evolution. Those who seek to better their group do better and pass on their values. Those who go it alone, die (and good riddance). There's a reason Tesla opensourced its patents. Because Elon Musk isn't a greedy a$$hole. He's philosophy isn't "I got mine, screw everyone else." The world needs more people like him, not people with your philosophy.And if you want to start tabulating death tolls, why don't we sum up all deaths due to religion. It's more than every single war in the history of humanity combined. So.... yeah. I'll take a large government over religion any day. There's far less likelihood my government will cause my death than some insane religious person. Notice the correlation between religion and death. As the world has become less religious (a verifiable fact) the world has entered the most peaceful time in human history. Coincidence? Perhaps. But, more likely, we don't allow the religious to kill people that don't believe in the same childish fairytales as they do. See, back in ancient times, if I called you insane for believing in an invisible man in the sky, I'd have been killed. Now, people see me as informed and you as backwards, well... at least people that matter. In fact, if religion hadn't existed, we'd likely be hundreds or thousands of years ahead, technologically speaking. Instead of killing anyone who challenged church dogma, they'd have lived to research science.So, perhaps it is you who needs to expand your world view. You parrot Republican talking points with a very US-centric viewpoint, not considering anything outside the US which has proven to better, such as health care, taxation, government roles, etc....It doesn't really surprise me though. You have no grasp of US laws, rules, and regulations, why would you even be able to begin to fathom anything outside the US?</comment>

<comment>You implied that clean energy would overtake fossil fuel. I don't see that happening. I'm sure that alternative forms of energy will be used more than they are being used now, but I can't imagine fossil fuels becoming anything less than something we absolutely rely on. I've seen no evidence for anything of the sort. And the only reason alternative forms of energy are relevant are because of government manipulation. Also, Elon Musk is a fiscal Conservative who loves Margaret Thatcher and believes in American exceptionalism. He would agree with me on taxes and the role of government. I credit the free market for giving a guy like Elon Musk the opportunity to try and save the world and turn a profit at the same time. Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffet (though I differ with them politically) are other great examples of superrich people trying to use their wealth for the good of mankind. I would rather leave it up to them than the stupid, forceful government.I'm gonna stick to my generalization of Communists as being ungodly and Atheist. Obviously there are exceptions, but history and common sense back me up.Can you give me some specific examples of values of Roman society that correspond with and predate Judeo-Christian values?I don't know about your take on the evolution of man. Man, like most other animals, is generally not inclined to kill members of his own species or to make their lives miserable. There is definitely an evolutionary reason behind that, as a species that mistreats its own will surely not survive. But man can get ideas and become evil (animals can't). And if you look at the mass genocides throughout human history, it's pretty clear that that evil can result in atrocity. However, the idea that humans should look out for the greater good has many caveats. One being that the best way to look after your neighbor and the young people of your community is not to give them what they need, but to provide wisdom and guidance so they may take care of themselves. It's the "teach a man to fish" adage. Anyway, who has been more generous and charitable in human history than religious people? And how would education have been brought to the masses without churches?Don't worship false idols functions as a personal law, not a governmental law. It just means don't worship anything as if it were holier than God. One could argue that Statist societies of the 20th Century (by worshiping the state or their dictators) broke this law on such a grand scale it led to the deadliest time period in human history. Someone who worships money, himself, his sexual escapades, etc. is breaking this law, and likely ruining his life and the lives of people around him. It seems stupid, but it makes a lot of sense. Nowhere in the 10 Commandments does it say "worship Me". It just says "don't worship anything else".Your claim about the highest taxed countries being the happiest and having the highest quality of life is false. There are great "where-to-be-born" countries that pay high taxes, and there are low taxed societies as well. Switzerland is the happiest country and best country to be born in, and they have some of the lowest taxes (the lowest?) in Europe. Singapore and Hong Kong rank high in quality of life and happiness, and low in taxation. There is no correlation between taxes and happiness. Also, some countries pay a high personal tax, but low sales or corporate tax. So it's not easy to generalize.As far as Scandinavia goes, there is much misunderstanding of the region and its history thanks to ignorant fools like Bernie Sanders. The Scandinavian nations were already the happiest and healthiest and wealthiest countries in the world when they began implementing Socialist policies around 1970. Up until then, they were exceptionally Capitalistic. They are living off the fumes of the industrial revolution, and their futures may not be so bright (notice the rise of right-wing parties across Europe as evidence that people are getting fed up with Socialism and neoLiberalism). Remember how you said that peoples who do what's good for the common good reproduce and survive? Well, the Scandinavian people are clearly depopulating. They have extremely low birth rates (like most of the Western world), and the less developed, less socially-aware societies are producing the most people. There's no doubt about that, and it really kills your evolutionary point (at least in modern times).This is a very informative read about the truth in Scandinavia:http://www.iea.org.uk/sites/de...You also create a straw man by saying I suggest we should get ours and run. I think charity and education are extremely important. The difference is that I think people should take it upon themselves, not be forced by the government. Telling the government to take some people's money and give it to other people is not charitable or kind. It's just forceful and kind of Fascist. We have to improve as people and learn to voluntarily care for one another. If the government takes on that role, we'll just become envious and spiteful like children whose parents favor their siblings over them. We need to be the change, not force the change.Islam has killed more people than any other ideology in history. But government killed more people in the past century than Christianity has in its 2000 year history (hundreds of millions vs 20-30 million). When is the last time you heard about Christians murdering people on a mass scale? Governments and Islam are doing that right now.And I completely disagree with the fact that religion has held us back. You could make that argument in certain instances, but Judeo-Christian religions have led to our advancements, not undermined them. Religious extremism has been historically terrible, of course. But the faith and sense of community religion fosters? The charity and education they lead to? That's been invaluable to us. That's true of Eastern religions too.I live outside the US. Not in Scandinavia, but in Southeast Asia. Been working here for four years, and have learned a lot about the world. Before I moved out here, I was decidedly Liberal. I used to say and think almost everything you say and seem to think. But living here has taught me how superior our way of life is, and how precious freedom is. The people out here have no concept of freedom or Liberty or Independence, and they have terrible critical thinking skills and are far less happy than we are because of it. They have plenty of government-run education, but they are taught to be dependent and to fit in, not to be independent and find their own way. You should see how difficult it is for anyone out here to face a challenge on their own.By the way, my girlfriend and I are volunteer teachers in a terribly impoverished community on the weekends. We don't have much money and wouldn't give them money if we had it, but we teach them life skills and show them paths to success and ways to improve their lot in life in the future. My girlfriend grew up very poor, and worked her way to financial independence (well, we're getting there anyway). We're trying to spread the word. So don't be too quick to make the common false assumption that Conservatives are cold and selfish (I used to do that too). The difference is that we want to help people ourselves, not through government coercion. You know the best way to help people? Get really rich and really well educated. If you do that, you have the power to make the world a better place. Otherwise, you are forced to be selfish (understandably so) and depend on others instead of provide for them.</comment>

<comment>Further, you realize the only place "people" is written in the 1st Amendment is in regard to "peaceably assemble," right?It literally has no bearing on 1st Amendment rights. Corporations are not "people," yet they get personhood status for 1st Amendment purposes.</comment>

<comment>The US Government would be responsible for screening for a religious affiliation, not a nationality. Muslims come from every country in the world. Therefore our Government would be establishing a religious screening authority and that my friend would be problem.</comment>

<comment>I believe that this is the law in question:"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."-U.S. Code: 8 USC, 1182It's not about a religious screening authority that would be there indefinitely. It would just be done in drastic situations. If some sort of holy war breaks out (ahem), it might not be a bad idea to give the president this kind of authority. I definitely don't think we need a knee-jerk reaction to some BS that Trump said.</comment>

<comment>And that law makes no mention of religion of an individual being a valid class nor would there be any situation where establishing a religion would be Constitutional. It is easy to understand, We the People do not recognize an official religion, so how would this work?</comment>

<comment>But it says "any class". It seems to give the president the right to discriminate against any kind of person if he feels it's necessary for national security. I'm not a lawyer or anything, but "any class" seems pretty explicit.</comment>

<comment>Yes, you sidestepped the point where  the Constitution would explicitly prohibit the establishment of a religious "class"  and the test to determine said religion would equally be unconstitutional.It is about our Government and the power you would entrust to it in creating a religious screening authority. This is very dangerous stuff.</comment>

<comment>I want trump to expose how the government gives these middle easterners money (at least $80,000) to help them get started in a business of their own when they come here. Why do you think so many of them own convience stores and other businesses? American taxpayer again fleeced by our treasonous politicians. </comment>

<comment>False, Middle Easterners don’t get start up grants from the Governmentbecause on the Census they are listed as “White”. Only Asians get those specialgrants…</comment>

<comment>Do either of you ignoramuses really think that either of these groups is getting $80,000 to start businesses?   There really is no limits to the idiocy of American society nowadays!</comment>

<comment>You mean they´re not getting free luxury cars and summer homes in The Hamptons? But that´s what I read on the Internet.</comment>

<comment>I thought Cruz was all about defending people's constitutional's rights. But I guess he is when it fits his rhetoric. How much for the snake oil, "Ted"?</comment>

<comment>What Constitutional rights do non-citizens of the United States have again?</comment>

<comment>Pretty much all of them, if they're in the country legally. Many of them even if they're not.Voting and running for office are, of course, the big exceptions.</comment>

<comment>Brush up on reading the 14th amendment, again. Besides, green card holders, employees with work permits, etc. Immigration issues are more complex than you think. The Constitution protects all withing its jurisdiction, not just US citizens.</comment>

<comment>Then you're aware none of these classifications apply to Syrian Refugees on foreign soil.</comment>

<comment>This applies to people not on foreign soil.  No foreigner has the Constitutional right to travel to, let alone immigrate to, the United States.</comment>

<comment>You're looking at it a little sideways. The government is Constitutionally barred from establishing a religion or preventing its free exercise.</comment>

<comment>Trump's proposal wouldn't prevent the free exercise of Islam for Muslim Americans or Syrian Refugees abroad.</comment>

<comment>A good logical point.The law would still be pretty questionable and likely not stand up in court. I'm in favor of writing laws that are constitutional.</comment>

<comment>The practical logistics of this type of law are simplistically and obviously at fault.There is no way to test for religions without becoming a religious inquisition by Government authority, and that is utterly unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>Precisely.</comment>

<comment>Why can the United States not deny immigrants that don't serve in it's best interest?</comment>

<comment>It can. But not by imposing a religious test.</comment>

<comment>Why?</comment>

<comment>There never has been nor should there ever be a religious test. People came here to get away from religious persecution! Donald Trump seems to think he can do whatever he likes the constitution be damned!! The Republican Party must be kicking themselves that they welcomed him into their party with open arms.</comment>

<comment>Nice statement for the 20th century.</comment>

<comment>Please explain how we would use Government officials to screen for a religion.</comment>

<comment>With a spray bottle of holy water, duh.</comment>

<comment>That's as good a guess as any other.</comment>

<comment>Call my cynical, but I don't think you will get a conservative response. They don't really care if their ideas work or not, it's about feeling good.</comment>

<comment>Regardless of your opinion of immigration and the refugee situation, this is a rational vote by Cruz and the others. We can't just pass laws and create regulations as knee-jerk reactions to what some orange-haired idiot says.Religions are not that easy to qualify, and new religions can be founded every day. If there were a religion called "KillAmericansism", would you want to bar our border security from trying to find out if people from KillAmericans Isle adhere to that religion?Aren't there people out there who say ISIS is not Islamic anyway?</comment>

<comment>Let's get real- if a Democratic candidate called for a moratorium on Southern Baptist immigration because they have "hateful" views on LGBT (but really because they're white), you'd have 60%+ of Democrats supporting it.We've reached the point where are U.S. politics are essentially tribal warfare.  At least Trump is open about it.</comment>

<comment>Try again.</comment>

<comment>"Cruz’s vote is less surprising when considering that of all of Trump’s major rivals, he has expressed the least alarm at his proposal to temporarily ban Muslim entry. “Well, that is not my policy,” he told reporters initially before touting his own more limited plan to place a three-year moratorium on resettling refugees from countries where ISIS or al Qaeda have a presence."He does not agree with Trump's proposal of banning Muslims. At least from what you present here. You consider it a tepid denunciation, but it is a denunciation nonetheless. (In fact, I agree with a moratorium especially after the attack in California exposed a weakness in our immigration system).If I'm not mistaken, Trump's proposal is already unconstitutional. So to make an amendment to a bill restating something that is already in law seems...redundant.</comment>

<comment>Trump's proposal may well be constitutional.http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12...http://ericposner.com/is-an-im...I know, I was surprised as well.The problems are 1. The president's plenary powers about immigration have tended to be interpreted broadly by the courts; and 2. Old SCOTUS decisions upholding the Chinese Exclusion Act and the internment of Japanese during World War II were never overturned. The occasion for reversal and precedent setting never came up because both measures were repealed legislatively.</comment>

<comment> YES Donald Trump is and always will be a laughing matter. WHAT is NOT a laughing matter is what Republican's have done to their party, it seems they have really DUMBED them down and that is bad for our country. The GOP's new base created by Dumbing down America.</comment>

<comment>Has the US ever barred people based on their religion?   Yes , the Mormons.  they were physically kicked out of the country in 1844, forced to resettle in an area that was not the US and not readmitted to the Union until they made a major change to their religion in 1890.</comment>

<comment>Yes, let's use a shameful period from our past as a guide to how we should act today.  Maybe we should give Muslim immigrants blankets infected with smallpox while we're at it.</comment>

<comment>Mobs and vigilantes did the deed, not the US Government.</comment>

<comment>The United States did wage a war against the Utah Territory Mormons in 1857-8.</comment>

<comment>Did they?and as a result this happened ...I'm not sure that qualifies.</comment>

<comment>Brigham Young's involvement, much approval of that massacre is much in doubt.</comment>

<comment>The US Army was seeking to uphold the laws, they didn't arrive with a religious leaders to force conversions on anyone and they didn't use a bible to put down an insurrection of civil law.</comment>

<comment>but the US and the Illinois State government did nothing to stop it.   Further ,   the area they moved to was not allowed into the Union until 1896 and only after the LDS church made major changes to their religion .   Also by then enough Protestants had moved into Utah to make sure the Mormons were no longer in the majority.   Remember the Mormons were kept out of  the US AFTER the passage of the 14th amendment.   My point is that we do not have a consistent history of religious tolerance as a matter of national policy</comment>

<comment>tolerance and religious testing are not the same thing.</comment>

<comment>I think you've made a version of history to fit your narrative, having left out the proposal of the State of Deseret by Mormon leaders, and President's Taylor's attempts to limit the growth of free states in 1849.The Compromise of 1850 established a Utah Territory and Utah's flirtations with insurrection played as important a role as did their religious practices.</comment>

<comment>First , 1949?    Second that proposal by the Mormons was their intention to set up a separate country because they knew the US would never accept them because of their religious practices.    Setting up  the Utah territory included a lot of land  outside of present day Utah and I don't know what that has to do with the issue .   Mormons  first moved in the area when it was not under US control.   Once it became US territory,  it was impractical to dislodge them because of their distance from the rest of the states .  it was tough to get a military force out there and to supply them.   No railroads reach Utah terr. until 1869.     Their was constant conflict between the LDS and the US government precisely because of their religious beliefs and practices .    The US  probably would have run them out of Utah if not for the Civil War and reconstruction.   My point was this was an example of  religious intolerance and an attempt to exclude a  religious sect from the country.   Remember they didn't get Statehood until they knuckled under to demands to change their beliefs.   In other words,   the  US does not have a  history of religious tolerance  and has had religious testing to be allowed into the country.</comment>

<comment>There was no official religious testing - you can read all you want into a narrative of history but there was no official religious testing organization authorized by Congress, nor a law passed to present a test of religious affiliation to any citizens at the time. If you can show any official tests or laws authorizing official religious inquisitions, please share.The Mormons were outlaws, terrorists and murders according to contemporary history of their actions against the US government and our citizens. They were looked upon with suspicion because they wantonly slaughtered US citizens, flaunted US laws and attempted to create a theocratic government. That is concisely reported in the history of this group as being a prime reason to reject their request for statehood.</comment>

<comment>Religion had nothing to do with it; women were in short supply and the Mormons were taking more than their fare share.</comment>

<comment>Yeah , right!   I bet they were  not passing the jug around either .</comment>

<comment>I think if you really read my answer you would understand cause and affect,action and reaction,one bad apples ruin the rest. New laws forth coming into effect to deal with Muslims  and any others that are a security risk for the safety our citizens to prevent jehad or mass killings in the ability to obtain Assault Weapons for mass killings. Its got nothing to with religion or Christian beliefs. But there are some that will try the racist card or religion card like you are trying to do.</comment>

<comment>What is point? I'm talking about safety of our innocent civilians. </comment>

<comment>Islam is not a religion.  Islam is a military strategy for conquest.   There is no religion in Islam to test, so it matters not what is done in the Senate.  Also, the president with Islamic tendencies and a Muslim sounding name, will never sign legislation to protect America, if it in any way inhibits Islamic military strategy.    These people are at war with our country.  Islam have been at war with the world since Abraham impregnated his concubine, and against the will of God.</comment>

<comment>I got that covered in the "people having an opinion that differs from yours," because I'm sure that having a different opinion automatically makes someone a racist in your eyes.</comment>
