<comment>He just is expressing a subliminal desire to see him naked . . . snark :)</comment>

<comment>Finally some common sense coming out of the American government </comment>

<comment>If you mean undermining our allies and putting the US on a path to war, yes that makes allot of sense. Lets see how much did the Iraq war cost in money and lives?  To much to repeat that mistake this soon.</comment>

<comment>Your allies do not support you on this Russia china and germany are NOT  your allies they hate you. Russia just sold iran a missle defense system right in front of your face. America is becoming the laughing stock of the world because of obamas brutal policies. We are laughing at you</comment>

<comment>Laugh all you want it's better then another war we can't win.  We don't have a viable plan B.  Diplomacy is the only plan that is sort of war.  You really think this is worth starting a war over?  Even after what we have just been through? </comment>

<comment>Stop mettling in the middle east then. This deal only pulls you further into the conflict.  Save your soilders and money. Israel can handle themselves.  This deal is bad news for the west</comment>

<comment>If You only had a brain.  You should see the wizard.</comment>

<comment>How do you reason that Germany is not an ally of the U.S.? Germany is basically a lap dog to whatever the U.S. desires. They don't even quietly abject to the numerous military bases in the Fatherland.As far as laughing stock goes, the world community doesn't laugh at the U.S., they just don't understand its methodology or governing system.</comment>

<comment>Do you have a diplomat in Germany? </comment>

<comment>Don't expect Canadian air force to help, they sent their 4 planes to Iraq.  They've managed one sorti since they been their.  Guess they got lost, they are part French.</comment>

<comment>I suspect it was easier for the President to let this go simply because he knows he's not going to get the Iranians to agree to a deal, period.</comment>

<comment>Or someone finally explained to him how our constitution works. It takes congress to approve a treaty between countries!</comment>

<comment>Obviously no one has explained to YOU how the Constitution works, or spelled correctly, either!There's NO treaty here. the 5+1 have entered into an agreement. The congress (small c because they deserve it) can ONLY advise and consent in this case. NuttYahoo wants them to do more. But that's not part of the US Constitution to his chagrin.</comment>

<comment>Treaty:  definition: An agreement between two or more independent states.http://thelawdictionary.org/tr...</comment>

<comment>Bilateral agreement. International law is full of all sorts of tiny distinctions. It is not, as of right now, being set up as a treaty, but rather a multinational agreement.</comment>

<comment>Nuclear arms treaties have always been treaties, until now. Even the precedents Obama himself cited were treaties.</comment>

<comment>Unlike Western Civilization Roid, 'international law' is a figment of your imagination.</comment>

<comment>Appearently you do not have a dictionary check out "treaty", it is in Webster's. Constitution is not capatolized because U.S. is not the prefix!</comment>

<comment>"[C]apatolized? Seriously? And you were just saying you knew how to operate a dictionary.</comment>

<comment>AN agreement is a treaty in this context!! I don't know whose remarks you are referring to But if it was directed at me you also spelled "CONSTITUTION" incorrectly!</comment>

<comment>This is a kind of weak-kneed substitute for the Senate's Treaty Power. More than nothing, but less than their Constitutional role.</comment>

<comment>Don't complain who put the senate in power?? This b.s. started way before Janurary this started years ago, when congress became known as the do nothing congress!</comment>

<comment>This is not and never has been a treaty! And if Bibi and Chuckie and Bobby and Tommy derail this deal, YOU and YOUR KIDS get to go fight and die in the Mid-East desert this time around!</comment>

<comment>All hail the Speaker of the House and Senate Majority leader . . . .  Mr. Netanyahu !</comment>

<comment>I have already been there and done that! what have you done for our country, except open your mouth????????</comment>

<comment>If this is not a treaty ,what is it???????</comment>

<comment>The deal is cooked. The US Congress is not going to vote to go to war in July so for all intents and purposes it's a fait accompli. I expect there will be a lot of Sturm und Drang from the usual suspects in Congress in June and then as usual they will do nothing.</comment>

<comment>I really do love your sides talking point. Its either nuclear proliferation in the Middle East or Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar (for the Joos).But hey this video pretty much sums your sides argument.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Hey CygnusA81, despite what Israel thinks, this isn't about them.</comment>

<comment>Israel takes all those "Israel is a cancer which must be cut out of the Mideast" remarks personally. They are funny that way.</comment>

<comment>They are humorless that way.FTFY</comment>

<comment>Well this deal does effect them and other countries in the region. But since you are dimwitted to get that still, what's the point of arguing with you. Anyway please hold your outrage if Israel take matters in their own hands.MmmmKay.</comment>

<comment>Did you miss Cotons interview? His basic premise was that war isn't so bad, kind of a rerun to the same arguments made pre-Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Sigh. Stuck on stupid. That isn't what Cotton said at all.Try reading again. The concept you are missing is that if your diplomacy is backed by a credible threat of force, you will get a much better deal. If you get a good deal, you will be able to live with the deal, decreasing the chances of war. But if you get a bad deal with an aggressor who is only made bolder by the bad deal (bad for you, good for him), then he will eventually do something you can't live with, something that will force you into a war.</comment>

<comment>lots of "if's" here bro dude.</comment>

<comment>Well, "if it saves just one life, then a whole (unreasonable policy/law is worth it (a well worn left wing slogan that turned me slightly towards the Right a few decades ago) Then there the of course torture is wonderful 'if" a terrorist time bomb was ticking, a Cheney/Scalia argument that turned me away leftwards from absolutist extreme reactionary Right thinking.Yup if this, if that, if . .   if . .  if . .  then we have no choice but war, so let's get on with is. Roll the violent, expensive, deadly and utterly unpredictable dice of glorious war for the Homeland. Hail to victory!</comment>

<comment>meh .... the "left" and "right" jousting is boring.</comment>

<comment>Uh, I know that you are a left-loon who projects your way of thinking onto the Iranian government, and that facts don't matter, but I'll tell you a little secret.Iranian government doesn't care about Western style democracy and doesn't like the US all that much let alone Sunnis or Israel for that matter. If this deal is finalize, it will lead to nuclear proliferation. So stop being an Ugly American.</comment>

<comment>Lunacy is continuing to support the Saudis and Pakistanis, who finance the greatest threats to Americans in the world at the moment.If it takes supporting Iran to wake up these "allies," then so be it.</comment>

<comment>If the deal even gets done which is doubtful. Obama played by the Mullahs and Putin again. Pathetic. </comment>

<comment>Played how, exactly?  If there is no deal the sanctions stay on.</comment>

<comment>Buying time and dragging out negotiations for the maximum amount of concessions which they will get to their satisfaction or walk all the while continuing the nuke program. Obamas great trusted friend Mr Putin now having rapid delivery of a missile defense system for Iran has now destroyed any military options left if the agreement doesn't happen or they violate it.  </comment>

<comment>There were never an military option, not since 2009.If the deal fails, only the US will have sanctions on Iran, something they will ignore.</comment>

<comment>"something they will ignore."Because, of course, they can ignore it. The rest of the world doesn't have to do what we say no matter what most Americans want to believe.  It keeps Iran from growing their economy as much as they would like, but doesn't do much else.</comment>

<comment>Wait, why would half a dozen missiles dating from the 1980s destroy a military option? Or did you mean a military option without any casualties or negative effects? You should know that's not how it works.</comment>

<comment>"Buying time and dragging out negotiations for the maximum amount of concessions"!!!!Obviously your mom never taught you what negotiating really means when she homeschooled you. That means you're basically illiterate when it comes to intricate human subjects and skills.</comment>

<comment>I guess when you cannot muster a argument, you must attack the commenter with some lame arse  insult about homeschooling.  I am guessing your negotiating knowledge came from the experience of pleading for your life in Iran, after getting caught in a homosexual act by the local Mullah and receiving a reduced order of castration. </comment>

<comment>You amaze me at the astonishing heights you manage to take the discussion by exposing you homophobia and "knowledge" testicular formation.By the way, homeschooling is not an insult. Having no clue about the real world is.You tried to change the subject but failed as usual. Better luck next time.</comment>

<comment>I believe you changed the subject with insult, while at the same time offering no insights. I believe its the Iranian Theocracy that's "homophobic" which was my point. Iran is also a oppressor of women's rights and human rights in general. Also a supporter of global terrorism. </comment>

<comment>I am steadfastly against the "Iranian Theocracy".You were saying?</comment>

<comment>Well then you should agree with my view point that Iran can't be trusted as long as they are lead by the current leadership. </comment>

<comment>We made deals with the Soviets and Chinese when we did not trust them. We can certainly make a deal with a much weaker adversary we do not trust.</comment>

<comment>No, it's complicated. I don't blame you for not grasping the whole thing here. The ruling clergy wouldn't be at the negotiation table, if it were not because of political pressure upon them by the people in Iran. The regime big cheese were having a ball making money due to the sanctions. Business was good for their "enterprises". The whole idea of the sanctions was to push the Iranian people to push the regime to negotiate. That happened and Khamenie and the Guards were brought in kicking and screaming.More sanctions work the opposite way by signalling to the Iranian people that no matter what they do, they're going to be under sanctions. That's when the regime "wins" again due to an American flop.Obama's foreign policy handling regarding this issue has been brilliant.I hope I'm not boring you by trying to inject some reality into your head.</comment>

<comment>Ah nice.  When you can't win an argument, divert the conversation to "You called me a name and it hurt my feelings.".</comment>

<comment>He didn't offer an argument, but I did Marty.</comment>

<comment>Jack:They've been continuing the nuclear program apace since at least 2003 - or longer if you believe Bibi.  No amount of sanctions has slowed that program; Obama's sanctions regime has only brought them to the table whereby we can now offer concessions if *only* they agree to slow down/reduce the program.  If they don't agree to slow/reduce, the sanctions stay on, and the program continues but at least with continuing economic pain for Iran.  In other words, all it has cost us is the bother of negotiating.We can't say the deal is good or bad until or unless there is a deal. The arguing over the contents of the "framework" is all posturing for the final negotations which are currently on-going.  If I was a betting man I would bet we don't get the assurances or access we need, and there will be no deal.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I think it was just to shut Congress up. Their constant caterwauling about how they simply have to have a say, must have been very distracting.</comment>

<comment>"No amount of sanctions has slowed that program;"If the program wasn't slowed, how come they haven't tested nukes already? the program was slowed by difficulty in buying equipment, and some of the equipment proving explosively faulty.No more problems now. Russia is finally sending them the S-300 air defense system. Liberty hall.</comment>

<comment>How much earlier "should" they have been able to test weapons, professor?  And perhaps this puts the lie to Netanyahu's perrenial claims that for the past 15 years they've been "months away" from getting the bomb?</comment>

<comment>"...Maintaining that consensus once the administration returns with a final agreement will be a much taller task....".Only in progressive-land is there such powerful confidence in a "deal". Unfortunately, the only "deal" Obama is likely to bring home will be such a complete piece of garbage that Congress will be forced to downvote it.That way Obama will have his narrative as Mr. Reasonable who got together with the Reasonable but Misunderstood Iranians - and got a deal that the "crazy right-winger hyper-partisans" voted down for spite and "petty partisan politics".Of course it is also possible that there will be no deal of any kind.I wouldn't know which way to bet between these two alternatives.</comment>

<comment>Let me guess:  if Obama gets a deal with the Iranians it will be a disaster because Obama dealt with the Iranians.  If he doesn't get a deal with the Iranians it will be a disaster because Obama didn't get a deal with the Iranians.  Do I have that about right?</comment>

<comment>No you don't have that about right. If he gets a good deal - it is to his credit. If he gets a bad deal it is to his discredit.</comment>

<comment>If he gets a bad deal, recognizes it and walks away, it's to his credit as well, because he gave it the old college try.  Iran has a say in the matter, as well.  This is diplomacy, not war.What you don't seem to want to do is give him any credit for getting to the point of negotiating.  That's a good thing.</comment>

<comment>You are looking to be argumentative even when you have nothing to argue about.   Nothing in my post implied the opposite of :"...If he gets a bad deal, recognizes it and walks away, it's to his credit as well...".I don't mind legitimate disagreement - but now you are kind of acting like my wife on PMS.</comment>

<comment>Then we agree.</comment>

<comment>How graceful of you to throw you "wife on PMS" under the bus in such a chivalrous manner.I hope you wife can't read.</comment>

<comment>How do you define a bad deal?! You are basically saying nothing unless you clarify your parameters.</comment>

<comment>The Fordow underground facility will not be eliminated; the heavy-water Arak reactor won’t be closed down; and Iran will be allowed thousands of centrifuges unnecessary for any peaceful nuclear-power program.Immediate end of sanctions. Vague language on enforcement. Inspections schemes that can be easily manipulated. Etc.</comment>

<comment>Sorry I asked, I thought I'm talking to a real American instead I get a NuttYahoo parrot!</comment>

<comment>That's some weird Iranian who thinks that the only real Americans must be lovers of Iran.Looking for suckers to sell your overpriced poor-quality carpets or something?</comment>

<comment>You're a liar. The reactor at Arak is being changed permanently to make sure it cannot be used to make plutonium.</comment>

<comment>"Permanently" hahahahhahahahaha. That's a good one!</comment>

<comment>When nuclear proliferation specialists say that, I tend to believe them.Tell me, what are you qualifications? What on earth did you actually study?</comment>

<comment>Among the items which are being negotiated as per the "framework" is that the Fordow plant will be turned into a purely research facility, not a production one (as someone who leads a radiation oncology research program, I understand its non-military value).  Arak will be turned into a facility which can not make weapons-grade material.Now, if you're among those bothered that this deal does not demand the complete end to any and all nuclear material development, then you should be condemning it on its face.  But then you should talk to us about realistic alternatives and their cost/benefit, as well.</comment>

<comment>But no inspections on military sites, so how will we know?It's not a deal, it's a bad joke. Iran wanted time. Obama gave them time. Now Iran is having fun rubbing Obama's nose in his weakness.</comment>

<comment>One little question for you on this point, which seems to be a big issue with con servatives:  How many inspections do we have now, at any Iranian sites?</comment>

<comment>Correct.  It's not a deal.  We're still negotiating.Read this paragraph out loud, continually, until it sinks in:  "There is no deal yet.  The Iranians are publically claiming a number of things which contradict a number of things which Washington is publically claiming.  This is all part of the posturing which goes into such negotiations until and if, a deal is struck.  But there is no deal yet."Your insistence that we got a deal - bad or otherwise - with the Iranians is another of your lies.  You are either a liar or a genuine idiot.</comment>

<comment>Look here, little Early Bird.... This worm wants to know why the Obama-ites act like obeying the Constitution is a partisan issue.If Obama-ites keep talking about this like a partisan issue, it makes people think that Democratic Party is pro-Iran.  When I became a Democrat, Democrats were still pro-Israel. As a Democrat who is still very much pro-Israel, you can see why I would be unhappy with that outcome.</comment>

<comment>Well here's the thing, 2C:  The Constitutional issue of whether or not Congress should have a say in the deal (it should) isn't what we're discussing.  The poster I responded to was deciding on which basis he will praise or condemn Obama.  I think he's being disingenuous altogether: he's ready to pillory Obama no matter which way they came out.But I offered him another option for praising Obama, which was for getting the Iranians to the table in the first place and putting himself in a position to be able to walk away from a bad deal if he needs to.I hope we're putting the US ahead of both Israel and Iran, don't you?  Last I checked Israel had not yet officially joined the union.As for partisanship, I was a registered Republican for 30 years until just about six months ago when I registered independent.</comment>

<comment>"Last I checked Israel had not yet officially joined the union."And it is not going to in the future. That way Israel would have two Senators ONLY. This way...you know where I'm going with this.</comment>

<comment>Obviously, you're going into the land of the anti-Semites who blather on about Jews controlling the world.</comment>

<comment>I think IranMan is coming from the land of anti-Semites who blather on about Jews controlling the world.</comment>

<comment>"... for praising Obama, which was for getting the Iranians to the table in the first place ...."You have that backward.  The sanctions brought the Iranians to the negotiating table, and Obama opposed the imposition of those very same sanctions.  Now he's doing whatever he can to get rid of them.  And the whole reason the sanctions were imposed in the first place, was to keep the Israelis from bombing.  So how exactly does Obama deserve any praise for this?</comment>

<comment>European sanctions, not American sanctions. You conservative ideologues leave out that important fact in your talking point.</comment>

<comment>Not sure where you came up with that idea.  Sanctions against Iran under the Obama Administration have all been in response to Israeli saber-rattling.</comment>

<comment>I got that idea from facts. The sanctions didn't sting until Europe, and the BRICs, got onboard.The US doesn't do enough business with Iran for Congressional sanctions to be useful. </comment>

<comment>Oh, "facts".  All right then, I'm like totally convinced.</comment>

<comment>Nothing short of hawkish delusions will convince you anyway.Go read anything by credible experts on this. Rather than whatever ideological tripe you usually read.</comment>

<comment>Tenuously accommodating the U.S. in recent year(s), but not in 1996 or earlier attempts since the 1970s, isn't what most foreign policy folk call "onboard".</comment>

<comment>Ah...no.For decades the US has imposed its own sanctions on Iran for being a terrorism-sponsoring state, and there have been separate sanctions regimes intended to thwart their nuclear program with the US, some European nations and couple of others pitching in on an on-again/off--again basis.  There was never enough pain in these sanctions to get the mullahs to negotiate.It was Obama, who in 2005 was able to get the P5+1 members of the UN and the European Union to impose  brutal sanctions which crushed the dinar, crippled the Iranian economy and brought the Iranians to the negotiation table.  OF COURSE the entire point of sanctions is to use them as leverage in the kinds of negotiations which are currently under way, to reward them if they end their program and allow inspections, to keep them in place if they don't, or put them back on if we find them cheating on an agreement.Other than that, you're exactly right.</comment>

<comment>Was that in 2005 when Obama was in the US Senate?  Or possibly prior to January 3, when he was still in the state legislature in Illinois?  The sanctions put in place under Obama (during his Presidency, anyway) were all in grudging response to Israeli saber-rattling.  Other than that, I think we're saying the same thing.</comment>

<comment>The current Democratic party prefers being pro-Iran -- which is apparently just fine with the large cohort of Obama butt-kissers. So I think you don't have a party anymore.</comment>

<comment>If it doesn't make obama look good, it won't happen</comment>

<comment>What's your basis for believing that Obama is 1) a good negotiator, and 2) truthful when he represents the deal?We just gave Cuba a major concession yesterday.  What'd we get in return?</comment>

<comment>An end to keeping Cuba effectively frozen in the middle of last century.  Since we did so in the first place to keep the USSR in check, it's only slightly overdue.  The USSR collapsed TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO.</comment>

<comment>Cuba does business with over 100 countries, including all of the countries in the E.U. and Canada.  They didn't change their behavior.They now will do business with us.  They were desperate - their new sugar daddy, Venzuela, is in slow motion collapse.  And, we gave them a freebie because Obama is desperate for some foreign policy legacy, no matter the details.  Even the left agrees that he's a horrible negotiator, except when they're over-compensating to rationalize away failure.It will mean more money for Castro and maybe a tiny circle of his cronies.  But, they won't change their behavior, and the people will still suffer.</comment>

<comment>My only argument with that is that we have the ability to use our gravitational pull to drag Cuba away from the Castro dictatorship just through the introduction of people.Cuba is 90 miles away from the US.  Next door neighbors.  Lots of Americans travel to the Caribbean - as in millions of people.The Castro's won't live forever.  10 years of American presence (they can lock up 1 American for bringing computer equipment into the country uninvited.  Its not economical to lock up 100,000.Americans spend.  Period.  Cubans will not be happy after watching literally hundreds of millions of dollars pour into the country, only to see it walk away because of some aging government diktat.Toss in some MLB presence (Spring Training in Cuba rather than Florida), add in a team in Havana and Santa Domingo and watch things evolve.</comment>

<comment>It was a blow job to U.S. corporations, all of which want to do business (openly) in Cuba to sell products in order to gain those consumers. Globalization since the 1970s - pretty much a U.S. confection - increasingly kicked the legs out of ostracism.</comment>

<comment>Whatwe got in "return" for opening relations with Cuba is the beginning of a process of liberalization of Cuban political and economic life.  Lifting the embargo will be the biggest blow against the Castro regime that we could possibly strike.We don't know much about the Iran deal, John, but you illustrate my point perfectly:  he's wrong to get a deal, he's wrong to not get a deal.  You just know that if Obama is doing it, it's wrong; if he fails to do it he's wrong.</comment>

<comment>"Yet because of the way that the Corker bill is written, it will be much harder for lawmakers to actually  reject an Iran deal, than it was for them to guarantee their opportunity to do so."Sounds like Congress backed down, not Obama.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.  Congress was always going to be able to see the agreement.   The administration never contended otherwise.  Outside of WND and Brietbart, no one was even having that discussion.   </comment>

<comment>Oh yeah? who says? Obama was planning to present the deal as a fait accompli -- and he made no promises about showing all of it. Why should he, he didn't plan to have a vote?</comment>

<comment>Congress just wanted to be able they say they voted against the deal without actually taking the blame for the deal falling apart. The former will keep the donors happy and the later will save them from the wrath of the voters.</comment>

<comment>I don't think this is going to see a vote within 30 days, but Republicans are off the hook either way.</comment>

<comment>They're laughing all the way to the bank with their casino gangster sugar daddy's check in their pockets.</comment>

<comment>who knew grandstanding paid so well?</comment>

<comment>It even has a name. It's called Citizens United.</comment>

<comment>Hillary actually announced her support of a constitutional amendment to overturn CU today. She has my vote anyway, but she could actually win my heart with that kind of sweet talk!</comment>

<comment>I think there will be a vote, and then the vote will be vetoed and then there will be some yelling and some hedging and some harrumphing and that will be that.</comment>

<comment>If they do vote, they'll only be voting on U.S. Congressional sanctions. By that time, everyone else in the world will be doing business with Iran and the biggest concern will be getting in on the action asap.Just my thoughts, but I think economic interests will prevail & Congress will just put on a show of reviewing the deal.</comment>

<comment>Bingo!</comment>

<comment>Uhh.. no.They still hold Obamas feet to the fire on being able to reject his already-failing scheme any time after June 30 and require his report to Congress on any shady dealings by Iran that already include their trying to ship SAMs to the Houthis in Yemen.</comment>

<comment>Please Nathan, Congress will not do a thing, they have no room to manuever unless they all agree, something that won't happen.</comment>

<comment>Yet you do not know this. We however, DO know that Iran tried to ship SAMs to Yemen, [ hence the presence of USS STARETT and other USN ships in the region ] and that the unanimous vote in the Senate [ foreign relations committee ], contains the above provisions designed to throw a stick in Barrys spokes. [ especially in the equal knowledge by the Senate that it is no-go for the ''comprehensive'' inspection regimen by the IAEA, after they were shut out by Khameni last week ].</comment>

<comment>Assad was doing a great job cooperating with the U.S. against sunni terrorism… I watched former CIA director Michael Hayden say so in 2011.The entire tone of the debate over America's role in the middle east changed a few months later with the Budget Control Act. All of a sudden, Congressmen in defense-dependent districts (personified by one Ben Cardin), discovered their mouth for war.Congress needs those defense cuts to go away, and if it takes a big stupid war to do it many in Congress will not hesitate. </comment>

<comment>"We however, DO know that Iran tried to ship SAMs to Yemen""The destroyer USS Sterett’s search of the Panamanian-flagged Saisaban on April 1 came up empty." The article in Murdoch's WSJ that you posted the link.“I don’t get the sense that the Iranian level of commitment at this point is of such a magnitude that they are going to take a big risk of being exposed any more than they already are,” one military official said. The same Murdoch's tabloid article again.And you call gossip mongering "knowing"?!</comment>

<comment>Uhh, I referred to the PRESENCE of STERETT.Not to the fact that yes, Iran SAMs destined for Yemen were intercepted.You are lying to your readers liberal.You know full well that a ''ship packed with weapons, including surface-to-air missiles, was intercepted'' in 2012.That was not ''gossip'' liberal.It is a portion of the same WSJ Journal piece. The fact that the WSJ is owned by Murdoch is irrelevant to this discussion as AL-JAZEERA and AL-ARABIYA have stated the same thing and all through the last three years.Your lies, are not offering any substance to the discussion of how the region [and the US ] deals with the Iranian imperialists,particularly in the context of the so-called ''Framework''.also see:http://www.aljazeera.com/indep...http://english.alarabiya.net/e...</comment>

<comment>So much for barry's transparent government!!!!!</comment>

<comment>I want a citation for Iran shipping SAMs to the Houthi. Provide one.Also, even if they are, why is that wrong? The Saudis and others are bombing them and killing civilians. Why do the Houthi not have a right to AA measures?</comment>

<comment>You believe what Rupert Murdoch tells you in his tabloid?</comment>

<comment>Oh no - I would never believe the newspaper with the largest circulation in the USA - I get all my information from IranMan only.The WSJ is not a tabloid by the way.  You keep making boneheaded errors like that - I may have to start reading the WSJ instead of your posts for my news.</comment>

<comment>You won't be dis-informed.</comment>

<comment>So essentially more of the same US and Saudi allegations that have yet to be proven by any objective source?No proof in that link, just the same concerns and allegations the Saudis (who are not credible on this topic) have been making.Iran is sending aid, though not much, as even your source admits. The Houthi are winning on their own, not because Iran. </comment>

<comment>Right here.http://www.aljazeera.com/indep...Here is AL-ARABIYA observing more weapons flow into the region only three weeks ago.http://english.alarabiya.net/e...Here is the US Asst. Deputy Secretary of State for this administration two days ago.http://thehill.com/policy/defe...Blind and stupid is no way to go through life liberal. Stop defending the indefensible. Had Iran not meddled as far back as 2012, there would have BEEN no ''Saudis''.</comment>

<comment>It takes a true idiot to claim this is all Iran's doing. Not a single credible expert thinks that.Iran does not control the Houthi. They're tossing them scraps so if they win Iran has some credit built up.</comment>

<comment>Then blame your own State Dept and presidential administration along with its Defense Dept for being ''true idiots'', and you of course, being the globes foremost armchair expert on these matters.Hubris liberal..Hubris..........................................................</comment>

<comment>And it takes an even larger one to ignore the fact that it is this administration and its State and Defense Depts, who agree with me , and not you, on this score.Here liberal.Explain this.http://thehill.com/policy/defe...Any time you are ready to quit peddling your BS ...............</comment>

<comment>Oh, but congress can make special accommodations when it comes to belittling the president. Boehner and McConnell have all the time in the world for undermining Obama. They've made it their priority to do exactly that.</comment>

<comment>Ask him.If Iran gets too big for their britches, they need to be bombed.</comment>

<comment>You must be a member of the one-size-fits-all club. How about that little thing like volunteering to bomb Iran?  Are you game?</comment>

<comment>Who will pay for the bombs and the jet fuel used to deliver the bombs?</comment>

<comment>You wanna talk money?! We ain't gonna talk about no stinking money. We're only going to talk about whether you're ready to place your southern lips in a bomber and bomb Iran! As a volunteer of course.</comment>

<comment>SO THE NON INTERVENTIONISM GOES OUT THE WINDOW ALREADY?WHAT OTHER DEEPLY HELD CONVICTIONS WILL BE GONE IN A WEEK?</comment>

<comment>Ah, some positive news out of the Iran talks debacle.Not that Republicans gave themselves and the Democrats that much room to maneuver, but its better then what Dear Leader was trying to impose on the American people.</comment>

<comment>Diplomacy is a debacle? Oh wait, we're supposed to bomb Tehran since Netanyahoo heard them breathe funny towards Israel.</comment>

<comment>Calling Israel a "one bomb country", what a thigh-slapper.</comment>

<comment>Ah, so "no action" means the agreement moves forward when Congress stalemates?  So this is nothing more than Congress demanding its 30-day grandstanding period.There's not a chance for any outcome except Congress taking no action.</comment>

<comment>"So this is nothing more than Congress demanding its 30-day grandstanding period."And to ensure that the casino gangster keeps writing check to reward his GOP stand-ins.</comment>

<comment>Congress finally finds their backbone and gets something done.It's a shame it's not something that actually helps the American people, rather than something that helps the electoral chances of Republicans and a few Democrats. </comment>

<comment>Because Bradan Feasa actually knows better what is good for the American people than they do themselves!</comment>

<comment>This deal is good for the American people, most of whom, sadly, don't know the first thing about foreign policy or Iran, and just repeat what they see in the media, which is often erroneous.Foreign policy is not a major concern for most people.

<comment>It looks to be not much more than a fig leaf for Congress. They get to vote they don't like it, but not by enough to derail it. That may be worst than nothing if they really wanted to stop it.</comment>

<comment>So the elected trolls in Congress be able to grandstand and spout their paranoid, Bibi inspired, AIPAC funded nonsense?Oh goody!</comment>

<comment>Which sanctions can the Congress prevent from being "waived"?The unilateral US sanctions?The EU sanctions?The UNSC sanctions?Surely the Congress does not have any jurisdiction over the EU and UNSC sanctions. So they're left with the unilateral US sanctions which AIPAC has ordered them to preserve. Good luck convincing the US oil giants, aircraft manufactures, auto manufactures and US farmers that what AIPAC wants is good for America! While the EU, Russia and China gobble up the most lucrative energy, consumer goods and pharmaceutical, and agricultural goods export agreements to Iran.Maybe NuttYahoo will be able to compensate the US workers by returning the next multi-billion dollar check taken from the US increasingly impoverished taxpayers pockets not cashed! Is that a far fetched idea? Too good to be true?! It's not too much to expect some sort of help from our "most valuable ally" for a change. Allies that keep taking and never give are not allies. They are parasites.</comment>

<comment>There won't be a deal and the can will just get kicked down the road more while Iran continues to run the clock while continuing their development.The only chance is to financially bring them to their knees and force them to concede.These are people who will sign their name to a document and then deny it is their signature.</comment>

<comment>"These are people who will sign their name to a document and then deny it is their signature."Do you have an example?</comment>

<comment>Actually I think Iran suffers greatly if they don't get a deal done that removes the major sanctions.Iran's GDP fell from $528 Billion in 2011 to $368 Billion in 2013.  That's a drop of over 30% or roughly $160.00 Billion.All that is BEFORE oil prices plunged at the end of 2014.  Figure six months of oil prices down to the $40 - $50 range pushes that GDP figure down likely another 20% before all is said and done.Worse for Iran, prior to the massive run up in oil prices following the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 - Iran's GDP hovered around $100.0 Billion.  Depending on how much pain the Saudis can bring to bear on their Persian Gulf rivals, could point to Iran's economy collapsing as much as 80% from its peak levels.Wars are expensive and Iran is supporting several.  We found out how much money can get burned over the course of a decade.  Iran now is too.https://www.google.com/publicd...</comment>

<comment>It is more about face saving for some select folks. Could this have something to do with  Putin offering Iran a missile deal?</comment>

<comment>It's not a missile deal. They're defensive units. Besides, that deal was in place years ago and just held off on.I'm sad the media is buying into the reactionaries on that issue. It will make it harder for someone to attack Iran, but unless that's our goal, it's a non-issue. People are acting like Russia just armed Iran to attack everyone or something. </comment>

<comment>If Russia installed long range ballistic missiles with nukes in Iran, you would come up with some pathetic apologetics for that too! Clueless. </comment>

<comment>Look up "hypothetical", then you may finally figure out how not to sound "pitchy".</comment>

<comment>Go read the reports. What Russia sold are explicitly defensive weapons. That's why the US has only put out measured criticism. It's not a game changer.</comment>

<comment>Dude, the whole "Russia is selling weapons to X country in the M.E" is overhyped. Russia has been doing that since the 1950's.</comment>

<comment>It's a legitimate concern....If we're planning to invade or bomb Iran.If we're not, it affects nothing.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but the S-300 is not just selling several million AK-47's.This is one of their high-end X-mas holiday specials.</comment>

<comment>Who claimed they were not? S300 air defense missiles. It is a game changer as it makes it near impossible to strike Iran Nuke facilities in the future. Russia also rebuked US pressure and a UN Resolution. </comment>

<comment>We never had a realistic military option. I don't see what you're so upset about.We also knew about this deal years ago.</comment>

<comment>Ash Carter says different, and as he is SecDef, I tend to believe him.</comment>

<comment>Link to it. Because plenty of very smart people have said otherwise.</comment>

<comment>What, are your arms broken? You can't use Google?http://thehill.com/policy/defe...http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/10/...http://www.timesofisrael.com/c...</comment>

<comment>Political doublespeak. We can't shut down the program with a bunker buster. We can delay it at best.That talking point was debunked ages ago. Military action is the most likely way to convince the Iranians that they need a bomb for protection.Carter is playing to ideological halfwits like you.</comment>

<comment>Don't defenders of this crappy non-deal, like you, defend it by saying it will delay Iran getting a bomb for 10 years? so how come you argue for delay out of one side of your mouth, but against out of the other?In fact, bombing will do a whole lot more to really delay an Iranian nuclear bomb than your fake non-deal which lets them have a bomb even if they don't cheat. But of course they will cheat. They always have. So your option is just a total cave, with a little window-dressing on top.</comment>

<comment>No it won't, it'll just make them more likely to get a bomb.</comment>

<comment>Gods below. Do you understand basic IR and political thought?This deal REDUCES the need for Iran to gain a weapon, because it REDUCES their feelings of insecurity in the region.Bombing them INCREASES their need, because it INCREASES their feeling of insecurity in the region.Read up on the security dilemma. </comment>

<comment>What a nice demonstration of how IR theory makes you permanently stuck on stupid. The Iranians don't want a bomb because they just feel insecure. They want a bomb to conquer the neighborhood. That is their preferred cure for "insecurity".If Iran had not messed so badly with Lebanon and Saudi Arabia and Syria for the last thirty years, they wouldn't need to feel so "insecure" about anything. They are the largest country in the local region; they could defend themselves with conventional means. Even paranoids have enemies, and Iran's case they got them the old-fashioned way -- they made them.</comment>

<comment>Prove your assertion you hateful little troll. Where is your evidence? How do you know their inner thoughts?Because literally every credible expert says your full of it.They wouldn't? I guess Mossadegh never happened then.</comment>

<comment>I mean, they're more or less winning the whole "regional power" game.Saudi Arabia has always hated Iran, Shi'te and Persian? Oh Hell no, Saudi Arabia don't play that lol.</comment>

<comment>KSA and Iran are promoting the two leading brands of Islamism. Both ideologies demand to take over the world. They are natural rivals.</comment>

<comment>They are both emulating Zionism.</comment>

<comment>Another lie from somebody who clearly thinks The Protocols of the Elders of Zion are factual.</comment>

<comment>What protocols? I don't read Latin.</comment>

<comment>Foreign Policy magazine has an interesting article this week on the latest stage of that rivalry.</comment>

<comment>"If Iran had not messed so badly with Lebanon and Saudi Arabia and Syria for the last thirty years, they wouldn't need to feel so insecure about anything.Care to connect Lebanon, Saudi Arabia and Syria to Iran in a way that you won't confuse yourself. You sure don't make any sense in the statement above.</comment>

<comment>Marine Barracks and Khobar Towers for starters. Connecting Syria to Iran is too obvious to need explanation, even for a regime apologist like you.</comment>

<comment>Any relevant evidence for starters? What about the Khobar Towers?</comment>

<comment>azt24, what is your favorite animal?</comment>

<comment>Must be weasels ;-) He sounds like one, and he thinks like one.</comment>

<comment>What "game" are you talking about?! Iran is being brought back to the West's domain, not servitude like before, and we should be happy about it. Iran's legal and open LEU program will not be under a vast 24x7x365 observation and monitoring. How bad is that? Instead you keep clinging to some hysteria about the "game".The world is going to be safer with Iran getting its deserved security in the region. That day is here.</comment>

<comment>Iran remains a rogue state that seizes diplomats, blows up embassies in other countries, and issues fatwas inciting the murder of novelists.Not to mention how many of its own people it shoots, tortures, rapes, etc.</comment>

<comment>OK, but what does that have to do with the current negotiations which will lead to "un-rouging" of Iran? Iran has agreed it will do certain things the international community has asked her to do in order to take it rightful place back. This is a good and useful process. Good for everyone.You don't seem to be able to see the light and instead clinging to some worn out talking points. You're sloganeering without having any idea how to change it. Keep up the bottom feeding. You're good at it.</comment>

<comment>Did the blind defender of Israeli neo-fascist parties just talk about a "rogue state"? Hah!Out of the two, the country you blindly support is in far more trouble under the law than the one you hate. </comment>

<comment>It's still an issue, especially with Putin sending his jets out on aggressive border patrols and fly bys.Selling the S-300 is a slap in the face of the other negotiators.  If Russia is really on board with pushing for ways to keep Iran from developing nuclear weapons, then the sale wouldn't even be on the table.</comment>

<comment>If Russia nuked us we would all be dead.Discuss.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Iran already has ballistic missiles. We don't need to imagine. They carry quite a small warhead, I understand. Not much use for conventional weapons.</comment>

<comment>So I assume you're okay with us putting a Nato missile defense shield on Russia's border at the same time you decry what Iran is doing, because... Iran.</comment>

<comment>Iran is a bad actor and supports global terrorism so yes because... They want a defense shield for the sole reason to protect their nuke program.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't sound like Obama backed down at all. Congress is voting on lifting Congressional sanctions, as it always was, not on whether the deal is approved or not. The GOP took out the main point of contention, the clause that made lifting of sanction dependent on Iran ending its "support of terrorism." The negotiations and deal will proceed as planned, and Congress will pretend that they have a say.</comment>

<comment>The Senate surrendered an ABSOLUTELY EASY rejection, requiring only 1/3 plus 1, of those senators present.  Therefore, the Senate just CONSENTED to the Iran Deal.  Is the Atlantic so easily mislead?  Is Russell Berman so gullible?Is a capitulation on Fast Track Trade next in store?  How will Atlantic pose that as 'another Obama defeat'?</comment>

<comment>That is the way I read it as well. Obama must be laughing.What is needed is for Cruz to shut down the government in protest again. That worked so well last time.</comment>

<comment>What is needed is for the Senate Republicans to get a different Majority Leader.</comment>

<comment>Isn't NuttYahoo the Senate Republican Majority Leader already?! You didn't know that?! What an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Already? Gee...what happened? Reality set in?</comment>

<comment>"Maintaining that consensus once the administration returns with a final agreement...."That last sentence should have read, if the administration returns with a final agreement.  Obama has been out selling a deal that doesn't exist.  The Iranians are happy to have him expounding upon the particulars of a framework to which they haven't yet agreed.  Their ploy is to get him so tied to the deal that he'll agree to their next set of demands when they meet again.So what happens when the deal to which the Iranians will actually agree looks nothing like the one the Obama people have already announced?  Is Congress going to just say: sure, you told us that the sanctions would be eased only when the Iranians keep up their end, but since you and they are asking so nicely, we'll just vote to end them right away?  The farther this goes, while the ayatollahs keep chanting "death to America", the more questions Congress is likely to have.  The important thing is that their ability to ask those questions be preserved.The president must be hoping that the 30-day limit will allow him to slide some stuff past Congress.  We'll see.</comment>

<comment>Iran is acquiring weapons of mass destruction, Oh No!  It will only take 3 trillion dollars and ten years and then the US can declare we lost another war.  But think of all the cool weapons and contracts we will have to get political contributions.  And our sons and daughters will not have to fight the war.  We have the best mercenary army in the world.  I personally don't care if they get nuclear weapons, look at Pakistan and India. Oh and what about Israeli nukes.  Not worth one troop loss... not one!</comment>

<comment>Just think of all the "Meet the Press" shows McCain can be on if the U.S. goes to war with Iran! (TV lights are what keeps the man alive)</comment>

<comment>I'm waiting for McCain's re-release of his minor chart hit 'Bomb, Bomb, Iran'. I hear he got Bibi to do the back-up harmony so they sound more like the Beach Boys.</comment>

<comment>Charming.</comment>

<comment>Most of which haven't been ruled by Iran since the Achaemenids, or in the case of Iran the Sassanids.Are you going to claim to speak for them Azt? Do you even speak Arabic? </comment>

<comment>What's the difference?</comment>

<comment>Time period, plus some differences in governance and military tactics and ideology.</comment>

<comment>Iran seems to be kicking Saudi Arabia's ass in Yemen.</comment>

<comment>The Houthi are. I still haven't seen any credible evidence that Iran has much to do with it.But yeah, it's a boon for Iran's image overall, but the best thing for them is they've basically committed nothing. The Saudis own every bit of misfortune that occurs.</comment>

<comment>The RG are training the Houthis in Yemenhttp://www.reuters.com/article...Local militiamen in Aden say they captured two RG officershttp://www.jpost.com/Middle-Ea...Again, the wonders of Google could tell you this.</comment>

<comment>I saw those claims when they were reported. They haven't been verified by any objective source AND I don't consider trainers significant assistance. The US has trainers in half the countries in the world, if not more.Even the DoD says Iran has committed any significant aid to the Houthi yet, and Saudi claims are hyperbolic.</comment>

<comment>Iran sent two warships to Yemen, causing the current standoff. You going to dismiss that too?</comment>

<comment>Causing the standoff? What a ridiculous lie. The Saudis caused this problem from start to finish, trying to meddle in Yemen for their own gains. They've been doing so for nearly a decade at this point.Again, what is your expertise? What is your actual degree, if you have one, in? Answer the question troll.</comment>

<comment>If by "meddle" you mean prevent a Revolutionary Guard / Houthi takeover of Yemen.</comment>

<comment>Do you know anything about the Houthi you dishonest little shill?The Saudis attacked them, with the Yemeni government, back in 2009. They lost. The Yemeni government killed their leader back in 2004. Since then, they fought something like six major "wars" against them, and failed every time.The Houthi didn't need Iran. They're winning on their own strengths. Iran is just tossing them some scraps in case they win. Small investments for future influence.But I know fascists like you see evil bogeyman Iran behind every curtain.Now answer the question you slimy little troll. What is your actual expertise in. It's clearly not this. It's not domestic politics. It sure as hell isn't science or history. So enlighten me.</comment>

<comment>The Saudi ill-advised adventure in Yemen has given free range to Al Qaeda to the extent that they are now controlling parts of Yemen! The Houthis are Yemenis, the Saudi and the Al Qaeda are not. Do the math.</comment>

<comment>There's no standoff whatsoever. Iran has had "assets" in the Gulf of Aden for months patrolling against the pirates. This has been in full view of everyone in the international waters.Do something about your hysteria.</comment>

<comment>The situation sounds fluid, from this reporthttp://www.reuters.com/article...</comment>

<comment>Now you're posting like a broken record. Too lazy to google?!</comment>

<comment>Ehh, only the Iraqi's could say they're being controlled by Iran and even then not really, just Baghdad.</comment>

<comment>The Lebanese are ruled by Hizbullah, which is Iran's foreign legion. Iran founded them, armed them (more than once since Israel destroyed the missile stocks), pays them, sends RG officers to lead them. Hizbullah obeys orders from Tehran, which is why this supposed Lebanese force that is all about "resistance to Israel" has been fighting for Butcher Assad for four years now.Baghdad and Southern Iraq are ruled by Iran. The Assad regime and the territory it controls owes its existence to Iran. And now there are the Houthis, backed by Iran, leading to the current Iran/US/Egyptian naval standoff off the coasts of Yemen.So that's way more than just Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Iran founded Hezbollah? Interesting. Problem is....Israel has more to do with Hezbollah's founding that Iran does.The Houthi are not an Iranian proxy, but I've told you this before, and I don't see why you'll suddenly become intelligent enough to grasp it.</comment>

<comment>And they want to be. They are Shia.</comment>

<comment>Worse than that. Iran is trying for the Shiite version of the Ottoman empire -- a caliphate -- throughout the Middle East and into northern Africa.   Currently Iran, through its proxies Hamas and Hezbollah, is involved in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria and Iraq. And this is without a nuclear capacity.  Iran is directly sending missiles to Yemen. All while its supposed to be negotiating a peaceful resolution to its nuclear developments and is still denouncing the United States and Israel and its leaders.</comment>

<comment>All of this is wrong. Literally every single bit.</comment>

<comment>Persia was actually a smaller version of todays Iran which includes Kurdish, Azeri, and Armenians. Most of those areas, while part of the Persian conquest would not have been considered Persia.</comment>

<comment>Israel has invaded and attacked more countries than any other nation on earth.  Iran has not invaded another country for over two centuries.Who knows what Israel will do when they've finally crushed the Palestinians.  After a decades long campaign subjugating another people, only a naïve zionist would think they'll suddenly become a good neighbour.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the Palestinians should not have dug tunnels into Israel to faciliate a civilian slaughter.  Or lobbed rockets (in vain).  Or not have squandered their aid dollars on tunnels.Read more: http://www.realclearpolitics.c...Follow us: @RCP_Articles on TwitterThe moral equivalence that you leftists draw between Hamas and Israel is astonishing.Remind me - when is the next election in Gaza?</comment>

<comment>I wonder if news of the Russian selling advanced weapons to Iran help bring a little clarity to deal.</comment>

<comment>Congress (afraid of being left behind) Acts! (and then there was all that AIPAC money being thrown at them)</comment>

<comment>S-300 was produced until 2011. The Russians already said that the missile system to Iran would need to be upgraded. What it means is that they will likely get the more advanced S-400 Favorit which is now in production.These missiles are one of the reasons stealth was invented in the first place because legacy aircraft have a hard time surviving in such an environment.</comment>

<comment>you pulled that out of either thin air or your backside.there's no reason to think that the Russians would give the Iranians more than what was contracted for.and there's really no telling when and if the Iranians will get anything at all.Russia is still obligated, as a member or the UN and the Security Council, not to ship any missiles at all to Iran under a Security Council Resolution" Member States are required under paragraph 8 of resolution 1929 (2010) to prevent the“direct or indirect supply, sale or transfer to Iran any battle tanks, armoured combatvehicles, large calibre artillery systems, combat aircraft, attack helicopters, warships,missiles or missile systems as defined for the purpose of the United Nations Register ofConventional Arms, or related materiel, including spare parts, or items as determined bythe Security Council or the Committee.” Member States are further prohibited fromsupplying Iran with relevant training and financing, and are called upon to exercise“vigilance and restraint” over the supply of all arms and related materiel."http://www.un.org/sc/committee...</comment>

<comment>Why don't you enter into Google the words Russia, Iran, missiles, and hit News. It would take you less time than launching this tirade at me.</comment>

<comment>tirade?scoffing at your claim that the Russians would send the Iranians more than what's contracted for isn't a tirade.nor is suggesting that Putin might not be sincere at all. there is nothing in the story that includes the idea that the Russians have actually agreed to a shipping date for anything at all.... despite the announcement that he's lifted the internal ban.the UN ban remains in place ....and that isn't going to be lifted any time prior to Iran and the West signing a final agreement  for full inspections.</comment>

<comment>dubi look at it this way there's no way in hell that either you or I actually know what's really going on at that level. You are being too "bookish" about the whole thing. At least one Israeli commentator claims the Iranians have been trained and some parts of the weapon system other than the launchers, such as the radar system are there already! Iran has scuffed at the idea of getting the old S-300. They are pushing for the newer S-400.</comment>

<comment>I really don't put much store in what some unnamed Israeli commentator might have to say as not all of them are either trustworthy or sincere.I'll believe that the Russian are shipping anything when the delivery date is announced and the stuff has been loaded.I put even less store in what Putin says than in what my dog has to say.</comment>

<comment>"I'll believe that the Russian are shipping anything when the delivery date is announced and the stuff has been loaded."Whew...thank you for not saying "until I get a text on my cell confining the delivery to Khamenie's house". That's why I said you're too bookish about this whole thang.</comment>

<comment>I believe that Putin's announcement is more of a threat than a promise.he wants to shut up criticism of his grab of the Crimea and threatening yo screw with the Iran negotiations is a ploy.</comment>

<comment>The deal was made years ago, and tabled by Medvedev. It's not a threat.</comment>

<comment>Medvedev didn't wipe himself before first asking Putin's permission.and we'll see if there's any delivery before a June final agreement.</comment>
