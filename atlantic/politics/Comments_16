<comment>i am really getting tired of the manipulative trend in clinton's campaigning strategy. hillary now boasts of being a "progressive" but only a few weeks ago crowed of being a "moderate". then when bernie sanders calls her out on it for being an "occaisional" progressive, clinton turns around and wants to call it a "low blow". when a candidate (in this case, clinton) seeks to make inflated claims about her own positions, the opposing candidate has a right to challenge the veracity of those inflated claims: that's not a "low blow" because bernie sanders would not have called clinton an "occasional" progressive had clinton not previously made inflated claims.it's the same with the TPP, she hedged on opposing it until the focus group results came it; which apparently told her to make a statement opposing it (even though she had previously praised it) -- it's like clinton is for something until she is against it.you can safely bet that when it comes to future debates, clinton will hedge on them and will seek to hold them at the most favorable times and locations for her. for example, don't count on hillary clinton agreeing to hold a debate in brooklyn even though she crowed about how she represented the state of new york in congress.another thing that i don't like is clinton's tendancy to conveniently "mis-remember" past events. with respect to bill clinton's support of the law known as "DOMA" (which actually provided *no* protection for marriage because the biggest threat to marriage is the decline of the middle class), hillary claimed that bill clinton supported DOMA to prevent republicans from passing a constitutional amendment banning same sex marriage. no such thing was actually true. then when it came to obamacare, clinton claimed that president obama couldn't have gotten a single payer system passed but the truth is that at the start of his administration, president obama spent (in my view, wasted) too much time trying to reach out to republicans in congress and to try to prove to people who didn't vote for him that he could be "their president too" that the president made concessions that he didn't have to make. with super majorities in both houses, he didn't have to insist on including republicans in the crafting of obamacare. he apparently (and at the time, naively, in my view) believed that we was bringing everyone together but the republicans saw that as a sign of weakness and they then proceeded to repeatedly make him look like a fool in the early years of his administration.the thing about using political strategy is that you don't want to make it transparent that you are using political strategies, because then you end up looking like a disingenuous manipulator. this is what i dislike most about the clinton campaign, it looks disingenuous and manipulative.</comment>

<comment>You are very, very forgiving in describing Hillary's support of the TPP.  Even her cheerleader-in-chief Erza Klein doesn't buy her newfound opposition:  http://www.vox.com/2015/10/8/9...</comment>

<comment>i'm a proud moderate centrist who is feeling the bern!hillary clinton and i have a lot in common in that regard...</comment>

<comment>Hillary is reluctant to debate in the state she used to represent.  We've got a newish arena in Brooklyn that's convenient to her campaign HQ.  I welcome a debate anywhere in NYS, but NYC seems ideal for both candidates.</comment>

<comment>Saved the most important question for last: "itâ€™s not yet clear whether or not each of the additional contests will be held during the workweek."</comment>

<comment>Her debate last night, when asked about getting $600K from Goldman Sachs, because "that was what they were Paying" is typical HILDEBEAST. What a lair and a fraud she is.</comment>
