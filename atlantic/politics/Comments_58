<comment>Lol. Political correctness is just a way of protecting betas and other useless populations from wannabe alphas. A real alpha like trump just barrels through it.</comment>

<comment>People who call themselves alphas protest too much.</comment>

<comment>They don't protest enough. </comment>

<comment>Not to mention, are never alphas.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that's my Shakespearean point. ;)</comment>

<comment>Lesson learned: Never post while still waiting for the coffee to brew.</comment>

<comment>Indeed.A restaurant that calls itself a "gourmet" restaurant almost never turns out to have really superior food.And highly intelligent people rarely feel any need to claim out loud to be so (it's usually pretty obvious who they are) -- and if they do, hardly ever do so by saying they're "real smart."</comment>

<comment>And people who call themselves "classy"  -- fuhgeddaboudit.</comment>

<comment>I love the victim "alphas." The betas are holding me down with their control over language... waaah!Internet "alphas": confusing "whiner" and "winner" since about 1993.</comment>

<comment>Help, help, those weak girly-men types are accusing me of saying mean things! Or worse, they might even call me a racist for saying racist things!</comment>

<comment>Ha!There you go, playing the race card again.You realize, of course, that makes you "the real racist" here.Also, too, "race hustler" and "race pimp."Not to mention "divisive."</comment>

<comment>hurr durr putting things in quotes makes me look smurt</comment>

<comment>Alpha Males don't dump their wives and children for other woman.  Alpha Males protect their family - not abandon them.   Trump's done it twice!   Alpha Males aren't afraid of women, like Trump is scared sh!tless of Megyn Kelly.  Trump is no more of an Alpha Male than Charlie Sheen.  He's a complete dirtball.</comment>

<comment>Dumbest comment, almost ever. Do us a favor and remove yourself from the genepool already. </comment>

<comment>He's more like a Gamma Minus from Brave New World- the ones who were alcohol poisoned in vitro to make them dumber and more compliant with the authoritarian regime.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the President of the "anti PC except for me" club. He wants to "tell it like it is" and doesnt apologize to anyone regardless of whether or not they are offended but GOD forbid you insult Trump, then he demands an apology and even threatens to "punch you in the face" or have you ruffed up by his sycophants. Thats not "alpha". Even tough guy Putin wouldnt say something so childish. He can dish it out but cant take it without going to twitter to start beef. Trump is all talk. He is the guy in the bar who says he can kick everyones a $$ and then gets beat up and sues. Seriously, Trump is working you people like clay in his hand. He could probably sell you sand on a beach and you would think it was the best deal ever. If Obama is the reason for the rise of Trump then Trump will be the reason for the rise of Kanye West. </comment>

<comment>A lot of Trumps policies like mass deportation, killing families of terrorists (who murder our families), and torture of terrorists (for no reason other than punishment) are very popular. Most people aren't libertarian betas.</comment>

<comment>Do you have a family that you do not want killed by someone who takes it upon himself to designate you as an enemy?</comment>

<comment>Don't you think we should track down the family of the San Bernardino terrorists to torture and kill them?</comment>

<comment>No.</comment>

<comment>With 'Americans' like you, who needs terrorists?</comment>

<comment>Who made you king?</comment>

<comment>You gonna get at mad at me for refusing to answer this ridiculous question, too?</comment>

<comment>You have no argument. You try to wriggle out when called for a your remarks. Weak. Sad.</comment>

<comment>You're the one sticking up for the terrorists.</comment>

<comment>I am against terrorists and terrorism. But threatening people with unspecified harm on the basis of ethnicity or religion--calling them traitors and criminals, planning expulsions, threatening torture of themselves and their families is a form of terrorism disguised by you and Trump as politics.It is laying the groundwork for despotism.</comment>

<comment>How is not murdering families sticking up for terrorists? Go live in Russia where they may think that's a sport. </comment>

<comment>Now that you mention it... Here is a curious bit of history you might not be aware of: Back during Stalin's times, there was the official policy to put members of families of those accused of state treason (read: about 2/3 of people sitting in concentration camps) into concentration camps too. The entire Soviet republics got a serious population boost from these folks.</comment>

<comment>A long ago I came to the conclusion that those who "tell it like it is" were just looking for an excuse for their bigotry.</comment>

<comment>A long ago I came to the conclusion that those who "tell it like it is" were just looking for an excuse for their bigotry.</comment>

<comment>You didn't answer my question.</comment>

<comment>Because it was a ridiculous hypothetical. Mine is a real question. Real terrorists, how do you stop them?</comment>

<comment>Try anyway. Do you want your family killed by someone for something they think you deserve killing for having done?</comment>

<comment>You think the families of the San Bernardino killers didn't know what was going on? The neighbors saw packages being delivered but were too ashamed to call the FBI because political correctness.</comment>

<comment>No, because they felt it was none of their business. The same as my neighbor's UPS deliveries are none of my business.</comment>

<comment>One thing you could do is stop being so weak-kneed and scared of them all the time. Remember, sowing fear is what they want. Just go about your business.</comment>

<comment>There is a set of tried-and-true methods already in place: FBI informants, communications monitoring, bank transactions monitoring, etc. We read news like "FBI foiled a terrorist plot" on weekly basis - where do you think this comes from?Curiously enough, not a word about killing the family members of terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Do you extend that same tactic to Dylan Roof?</comment>

<comment>So, "courageous" one, if one of your siblings, parent,s or offspring, should become psychotic, and commit mass murder somewhere, you're okay with sacrificing your life in recompense?That, in your eyes, constitutes justice?And, if so, will you publicly state here, that you willingly give the authorities permission to summarily execute you, should any of your blood relatives ever become a multiple murderer?</comment>

<comment>"Don't you think we should track down the family of the San Bernardino terrorists to torture and kill them?"Tell me either that's a joke or you're a 13th century Chinese warlord.We should have kept all of them out of the U.S. in the first place. Trump's crazy policies won't do that with future Tsarnaevs or Farooks:24ahead.com/trump-muslimsIf you actually want to do something to reduce potential terrorists in the U.S., then pester @DanScavino and others to get Trump to propose *realistic* policies, not just ones that entertain mouthbreathers.</comment>

<comment>Pretty sure that the courageous mr J is a adolescent male sitting in his parents basement getting his jollies by trolling everyone here with these ridiculous comments.</comment>

<comment>Do you think our founding fathers would support you? The courts? War crime tribunals?  Your suggestion undermines the principles this country was based on.  But then, I suppose you are not patriotic.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  It would be an excellent deterrent.</comment>

<comment>I have a family I don't want designated as an enemy by my government.</comment>

<comment>Why do you think that the norm (law) that forbids the extension of a penalty imposed by law to people who haven't been convicted of a crime ought to eliminated?(You can find it in common law and in the US constitution.)</comment>

<comment>No worries.We can just take them down to Guantanamo for 'questioning'.</comment>

<comment>We? suppose it is you being taken down. Then what?</comment>

<comment>But it's not me. And we both know that.</comment>

<comment>No we don't. You don't. Because you don't know whether you will be the torturer or the tortured in your world. That's how that world works. Fear, Uncertainty, masters and slaves. You don't honesty believe you will be a master in that world, do you? (If you are not a master now you will not be one there either.)</comment>

<comment>I knew for certain which side I would be on when I went to Parris Island at 17 years old. You can be on this side, too. They take anyone willing to serve.</comment>

<comment>That is in a country with a rule of law and general orders that forbade torture. You describe a different country where people can be tortured at will.Why do you think McCain is against torture and what can you say about Trump saying he was a loser--Trump had "heel spurs" so the got out of the draft.</comment>

<comment>That is in a military that tortured prisoners at Guantanamo, Abu Ghraib, and elsewhere. I think that was a good idea and we should do more of it.</comment>

<comment>Do you want to be tortured yourself?</comment>

<comment>So you swore an oath to defend the Constitution, then you repudiated it for authoritarian utilitarianism.</comment>

<comment>Your wording is confusing but you seem to be asking, "If enough people want it, why shoudl any idea be opposed?" and the answer is, "morality".</comment>

<comment>I will try again.  The rule of law requires that a person who iis punished for a crime be the person who has been found guilty in a court for having broken a law. For that reason family members of such a person who have not themselves been convicted of a crime cannot be lawfully punished. Proposing to kill the families or torture the families of terrorists for simply being related to the terrorists is and extreme form of the violation of this principle of law.In the constitution, the crime of treason is defined and it is stated that the penalty may not "work corruption of the blood" which means that it may not include punishment of relatives of the person found guilty.http://legal-dictionary.thefre...</comment>

<comment>Yes but I am not sure how we got here from the original point, probably poor communication.</comment>

<comment>I would say it has more to do with responses to Courageousmisterj´s trolling throwing the thread out of whack.</comment>

<comment>Notice how commenters with words like "courageous" and "alpha" in their usernames always seem anything but?</comment>

<comment>well, thankfully the constitution only applies to US citizens.</comment>

<comment>As always with conservatards, their claimed reverence for the Constitution is highly selective and situational.A bigger hypocrite you cannot find.</comment>

<comment>So if you had a cousin who committed an act of terror, and he had no other family, you wouldn't mind if the government killed you?  Just knocked on your door one day and said "Your cousin is a terrorist, so we're going to kill you to send a message to other terrorists, nothing personal"Would you do your duty as a citizen and walk to gallows or would you not want to die because of something someone else did?</comment>

<comment>These hypotheticals are ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Yes they are, because the idea of government-sponsored revenge killing is ridiculous.Tell me how you see revenge killing working.  Would there be some sort of trial, where people are "accused" of being family members of a terrorist and then executed, or would you just send in a SWAT team at four in the morning and kill everyone at home?  How about a drone strike?  One air-to-surface missile and then call it a day.So many options.  Which would you prefer?</comment>

<comment>I guarantee I will be the one knocking on the door and not the other way around.</comment>

<comment>So President Trump has found his first Brown Shirt.  Good for him.</comment>

<comment>There's plenty of military and law enforcement who support him. I'm far from the first.</comment>

<comment>So the paramilitary goon squad is really coming together.  Good to hear.EDIT:  I'd also like to add that I find it interesting that when someone accuses you of being a Nazi, your first response isn't "I'm not a Nazi", but rather, it's "I'm just one of many Nazis that are already out there."</comment>

<comment>They shall be named: "Einsatsztrumppen"</comment>

<comment>Good little Soldaten für mein Trumpf und für das Vaterland!I'm surprised they haven't already started making those "Make America Great Again" shirts in brown.</comment>

<comment>"We were racists. We admired the Nazis. We were immersed in reading Nazi literature and books that were the source of the Nazi spirit. We were the first who thought of a translation of Mein Kampf. Anyone who lived in Damascus at that time was witness to the Arab inclination toward Nazism."-- Sami al-Jundithey probably just don't want people confusing trump supporters with obama's refugees.</comment>

<comment>I love your comment.  And you know old courage the cowardly dog would be the first one to sign up . if and when. Trump makes his own private army to intimidate political adversaries.  So sad.  You have someone literally arguing for revenge killing and then saying he would be the one knocking like old walter white.  What a loser.</comment>

<comment>If these ISIS jihadists actually have wives and children, they are probably out with them on the warpath. They will end up collateral damage in our drone and missile strikes anyway. I'd feel badly for the wives, who are just considered property, but I bet the kids would be brainwashed into committing terrorism. There have been several child aged suicide bombers in the ME and Africa lately.I don't believe Trump meant that if some British kid gets bored with life in the UK and decides to travel to Syria to join ISIS, that his parents in Liverpool will be tortured and executed.</comment>

<comment>That they're "very popular" doesn't change the reality that those ideas threaten the core of what the USA is."When fascism comes to America it will be wrapped in the flag and carrying the cross."</comment>

<comment>And it doesn't bother you that those policies are popular?</comment>

<comment>You kidding?It bothers him that they're not more popular.All those pussy liberal terrorist-lovers just don't get what it takes to Keep Us Safe!The Geneva Convention is for sissies.</comment>

<comment>don't worry, most islamic countries never signed the geneva conventions - or the UDHR for that matter - because they banned numerous practices which islam explicitly condones as a means of expansion, and had been used by muslim armies since the time of muhammad; such as enslaving conquered populations and using rape as a weapon of war.it's fine, so long as we do it over there.</comment>

<comment>Killing families of terrorists is tit-for-tat, amoral, tribal revenge. Torture is not punishment; it is used as an investigative strategy to generate leads to prevent further terrorism. The vast majority of the western world does not accept torture on moral grounds, regardless of its supposed benefits, which are hotly contested anyway. And bestial language directed at women as a response to frustration with feminist PC culture is just that: Bestial. Real men don't degrade women, period.As for mass deportation, if the idea is to 'take back our country' then that's tribalism again, and it's very far from the Enlightenment ideals without which this country wouldn't even exist. So what's the point of gaining the whole world if we lose our souls in the process?Kasich for President! :)</comment>

<comment>haha might as well just burn your ballot.</comment>

<comment>I consider myself a protest voter :)</comment>

<comment>In case you weren't aware: killing families of terrorists is actually illegal as per international law.</comment>

<comment>The problem is, some of the population think that detaining individuals without trial indefinitely and torturing them on suspicion of terrorism is a-okay. They've lost contact with the basic Constitutional principles we rely on to ensure we aren't the ones carted off to Guantanamo someday, because our neighbor has an axe to grind and accused us of terrorism. Or militia activity, say, to put it in a rural working class context.</comment>

<comment>If you want to go that route - then, as a soldier on the battle field, aren't you depriving an enemy soldier of due process when you shoot him?  Claiming self-defense is no excuse- after all.Enemy soldiers need to be captured by non-lethal means and given speedy trials.</comment>

<comment>There is a key difference between civil society and war. Can you identity it?</comment>

<comment>Well that's just it: for a lot of these people there really isn't a meaningful distinction. They are "at war" with everyone who doesn't think like they do.</comment>

<comment>Well, creeping militarization of the society in general since 9-11 has had some very ugly results.</comment>

<comment>Also, I would like to thank Conor for being honest enough to include his third "politically correct" code pertaining to conservative political correctness, which has been with us for a much longer time than the left-wing version.</comment>

<comment>Political correctness isn't synonymous with the overton window of what is politically acceptable opinion. PC is the specific silencing of one side in the debate about race, sex, and class because it is supposedly immoral to punch down.</comment>

<comment>It is immoral to punch down.</comment>

<comment>@ welchblvd  "for a lot of these people there really isn't a meaningful distinction. They are 'at war' with everyone who doesn't think like they do."That's a fair point.But it brings up the following question, which I hope you'll consider seriously:Do you think it likely to be more effective to deal with them as if we are "at war," elevating them to the level at which they clearly want to conceive of themselves -- "warriors," fighting civilizational battles for their [misconception of] god and homeland, and willing to die "heroically" to further their cause?Or do you think it would be more successful a response to treat them as they are, a misbegotten criminal element with Kelvin zero lawful, social, or theological legitimacy, eager to slaughter unarmed innocents and noncombatants, including those of their own religion (but the wrong flavor thereof)?I would suggest -- because they've said so themselves, quite clearly and explicitly, in their "manifestos" and other communiques -- that if you choose the former, you are quite literally playing into their hands.That was largely the response of GWB/Cheney/Rumsfeld -- as a result of their response, do you think we're now doing better against them?Or worse?</comment>

<comment>These days it's pretty damned hard to tell the difference, and getting harder all the time. That's kind of the whole issue here.</comment>

<comment>Interesting you should bring that up. The military actually does require that soldiers safeguard enemy prisoners once they are captured, searched, disarmed, and secured, of course.</comment>

<comment>After the shooting is done, if you can take enemy fighters alive, you do. And once they are in your control, you are responsible for their well being. Though not their extreme comfort. Then they are delivered over to interrogators, whose tactics might befuddle the uninitiated. They are as likely to give a detainee hot tea and a cute woman or unassuming nerdy looking man to talk to as anything. When you are sleep deprived, hungry, and stressed such an offer is nearly enough you seal the deal. Anyway, dead men don't talk.But naturally the military and civilian system are separate. I don't object to killing combatants on a battle field, of course. I object to torture, and to indefinite detention without trial of U.S. citizens, and any other individuals subject to our jurisdiction (i.e. arrested on U.S. soil.) It's a pretty plain reading of the 4th amendment.</comment>

<comment>But that torture would only apply to a few peopleThis idea that a small minority suffering leads to widespread suffering does not hold water, and is detrimental to the well-being of a society</comment>

<comment>It's a slippery slope. How long before the big gov't starts detaining ordinary citizens because those citizens don't agree with them?Ps go troll some where else </comment>

<comment>Not much longer than it takes to elect regressives who've openly called for this to be done to conservatives, tea parties, and gun owners</comment>

<comment>That assumes that torture actually works in providing actionable intelligence.Those on the front lines tell us otherwise*.And, of course, it ignores the impact on the "society" in question.In the post-World War II atrocities trials of both Japanese and Germans, we prosecuted as war criminals -- "evildoers," as GWB would put it -- those who committed the very same acts you endorse.  America can be The Good Guys or The Bad Guys, but not both -- and the moment we engage in torture, we're no longer The Good Guys, and, by definition, the "well-being" of our society will have been degraded.*Just one among the many sources to this effect:https://www.theguardian.com/sc...</comment>

<comment>Are you really from China? It's quite a different world view.</comment>

<comment>yesbut no it's not, most humans understand sacrifice for the majorityuniversal humanism is a form of learned ignorance</comment>

<comment>Cool. And that would be a very interesting argument to have if I knew more philosophy and history. Seriously. Keep posting, I'll try to begin to understand where you're coming from. Us liberal humanists are so sure we'll have the last word. In truth, a more collective understanding is probably the historic norm. I don't think China will depart from that norm. </comment>

<comment>You'd have to pretend the enlightenment doesn't exist. It teaches that all men are created equal, a universal humanism that assumes equality before the law in order that people do not kill each to change the law.It is pragmatic solution, not learned ignorance.The idea that the suffering of a minority group is not detrimental to society ignores so much history it's amazing. Syria, Yugoslavia, Lebanon, Rwanda, Liberia, Myanmar, the list goes on.I can't honestly tell if Terry is a paid shill or nationalist zealot who doesn't realize or care about the death his ideals induce.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure China cares. Enlightenment ideals purport to be universal. This doesn't mean every human culture will sign up for them. </comment>

<comment>China doesn't care, but that's why their economy is eventually going to spin out of control and why the wealthy are fleeing to Canada, Australia, the US, and Europe with investment visas.http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB...Enlightenment ideals aren't universal nor will every nation sign up, in fact very few actually do. Terry's belief that enlightenment ideals were learned ignorance is actually wrong. It's acceptance of a truth that creates a stable productive society. Terry's ideal only creates fear and arbitrary law.</comment>

<comment>The "torture" meme is about intimidating our enemies. A pragmatist like Trump knows the value of it is limited to the psychological effects that spring from a fear of it. </comment>

<comment>Why stop there? What other laudable societal goals can be accomplished by implementing a corporal punishment regimen to enforce good behavior?  Maybe we can integrate our growing surveillance system with local correction centers to bring errant subjects in for the proper levels of humiliation and pain. I'm sure that we can trust the authorities to use it for the common good.</comment>

<comment>The psychoanalysis of Trump reminds me of calling a toddler's finger painting "Impressionistic" and looking for insight in it. Ascribing purpose, forethought, and metaphor to one of the most crass and inane public figures in living memory elevates him and his campaign far beyond any level it's achieved. Modern politics is ugly and in many ways broken, but Trump isn't the antidote to it - he's the epitome of it.</comment>

<comment>Trump figured out that the war against political correctness is not and was never about fostering "honest and frank dialogue".It was about insulting people you consider beneath you with impunity. There never was anything more to it. As you say, juvenile.</comment>

<comment>True. At its heart PC is about the golden rule. If someone doesn't want to be called ugly names, then that person should refrain from calling others ugly names.</comment>

<comment>The golden rule is a terrible ethical principle. I don't think any serious moral philosophers have taken it seriously...well, probably ever.</comment>

<comment>You are so right.Jesus of Nazareth (aka The Christ), Confucius, Lao-tze, Mozi, Siddhartha Gautama (aka The Buddha), Zoroaster, Thales, Socrates, Plato, Isocrates, Seneca, Epictetus, Akiba, Origen, Basil, Augustine of Hippo, Muhammad (aka The Messenger), Hillel, Maimonides, Francis of Assisi, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Erasmus, Baruch Spinoza, Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, Rousseau, Voltaire, Arthur Schopenhauer, Brigham Young, John Stuart Mill, Karl Popper -- yep, not a single "serious moral philosopher" in the lot.</comment>

<comment>Being able to imagine how someone else would react to your actions underpins the notion of empathy. I take it seriously as a guide to moral living, but consistent with that I'm fine with you having a contrary view that hurts no one.</comment>

<comment>I've just been convicted of a crime, and you're on the jury. I want you to let me go, because if the situation were reversed you would not want to be put in prison. Either you let me out, or you admit that you can't take the golden rule seriously as a guide to anything; if you ignore it in this case, then this is what your rule actually is: "you should do unto others as you would have them do unto you, except when you shouldn't". I hope I don't have to explain why that's useless.</comment>

<comment>I hope I don't have to explain why that's a complete perversion of the golden rule. As a citizen I want a just society, one in which criminals are prosecuted for my own safety and I want the rules applied equally to everyone.</comment>

<comment>No, you do, because it's impossible to "pervert" a rule; that you don't like where it leads isn't a perversion, it's an indication that the rule doesn't work. If it's a rule, it's a rule, and so it applies there. If it doesn't apply there, it's not a rule, and so why the hell are you talking about it as though it were one? Just talk about what you actually want to achieve - justice, fairness, what have you - instead of pretending there's some grand ethical principle underlying it. In this case, just say "use common sense", which is what you actually mean.I'll give you another one. I'm a masochist. I get off on being beaten and humiliated. Your rule says I should go around beating people up. Have another: I'm a timid, sexually frustrated twenty something on his first date in years. After dinner one thing leads to another and I start doing unto her what I wish she'd do unto me. Do you want me to keep going? I mean, if I were you I'd want me to keep going, but then I think the golden rule is stupid, so I won't.Oh, and if I were you I'd also retreat to the silver rule.</comment>

<comment>I was brought up with a golden rule that differs substantially from the one you learned. I'll agree, though, that your version is nonsense. You win.</comment>

<comment>So which version did you have? Silver: "don't treat others in ways that you wouldn't want to be treated"; Classic: "treat others as you'd like to be treated"; or Plus: "treat others as you think they'd like to be treated"? Don't dodge, don't equivocate, don't ad hom, just answer the question.</comment>

<comment>On the flipside, political correctness is not and was never about fostering greater tolerance for marginalised groups.It was about insulting non-elite culture with impunity and policing speech and thought such that only liberal political ideas were permitted to be uttered.  There never was anything more to it.</comment>

<comment>"Non elite culture"?The strain on your tu quoque is telling there.</comment>

<comment>Well, as Connor mentioned parenthetically, there is a strain of conservative political correctness as well.  According to conservative correctness, the police are above reproach in all things, one must never speak ill of a veteran or a soldier, any criticism of Israel equals antisemitism, and the Iraq war definitely not a colossal blunder.</comment>

<comment>"[T]here is a strain of conservative political correctness as well."Apparently, they're not allowed to curse either.</comment>

<comment>"Support Our Troops"...or else.</comment>

<comment>Well, except when it comes to actually, you know, spending any taxpayer money on them.Healthcare?  Not if it wasn't "service related."  (Agent Orange and so-called "Gulf War" syndrome - clearly NOT "service related.")VA?  Privatize it.Raising combat pay?  Don't even.Proper body-armor and vehicle shielding?  You go to war with -- well, you know:  on the cheap, and off the books.MORAL support is what matters.Well, that and sending them into action every time some third-world punk breaks wind in our direction.</comment>

<comment>you're talking about *cuckservative* political correctness. former conservatives who've coalesced to the left's open borders, uncontrolled immigration, etc., and only clash with liberals on minor issues, like veterans affairs or the legitimacy of the iraq war.those voices no longer really represent the conservative base anymore, if you haven't noticed what's going on in the republican primaries.</comment>

<comment>The future of the republican party is two 80 year old men, each accusing the other of being a RINO.</comment>

<comment>there's only one flavor of conservative which has formed government coalitions with leftist parties across europe. who've united in the progressive dream of no borders and uncontrolled immigration, against the wishes of their electorate and no matter the costs. (bataclan, cologne, etc.)those "centre-right" european parties are all staring into the same abyss the republican establishment is, as they hemorrhage support to people like trump and le pen.your 80 year olds don't get to decide who the RINO is, the voters do, and the conservative voter base is speaking pretty decisively.</comment>

<comment>Repeat that four times and it might make it into a Rubio speech.</comment>

<comment>Too many big words.</comment>

<comment>I think that comparing Trump to a toddler is what mischaracterizes him. He's an extremely skilled person. Let's not pretend like he doesn't know what he's doing. He's got several seasons of reality TV and a lifetime of media exposure under his belt. He's masterful with crowds and sound bites. Dismissing your opponent makes sense in a rah-rah base-stoking kind of way, but when the time comes to put together a strategy to beat him, underestimation will only be harmful.</comment>

<comment>I think that's true. Trump is a master at getting in touch with the GOP electorate's inner child but he himself is no innocent.</comment>

<comment>I think that "inner beer-drunk fifteen year-old" is a bit more precise than "inner child".</comment>

<comment>I don't think she was saying Trump has the intellect of child. He just has no serious policy positions, no real ideology and will say whatever gets him better ratings. In that sense, his "ideas", "proposals" and quips don't really merit any serious, considered analysis. Everything he does, he does for attention. Like a reality show star.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he is not stupid.  But he knows how to talk to stupid people.</comment>

<comment>quite true, trump has been running circles around the liberal media. it's uncanny to read his book, in which he discusses his strategies to manipulate the press, and then watching him put those strategies into action. the media keep falling for the same set ups and getting fooled by the same tricks, but yet they're too oblivious to realize he's playing them like a flute.of course trump has been doing this longer than many of the journalists covering him have been alive. perhaps "stupid" is a tad harsh, maybe just naive and unaware?</comment>

<comment>That was about the most brilliant assessment of Trump I've read.</comment>

<comment>CF has undertaken a protracted campaign against political correctness on campus and has done that by advancing the argument that unrestricted speech is an unalloyed good. Now he his forced to admit that this social and political norm is being used to destroy the principles of liberal democratic politics. His response is to propose that someone (not him) devise a way back up the slippery slope. Perhaps it is time for CF to acknowledge that libertarianism in another of its guises is simply a means of extending the power of those that have it by any means they choose to the detriment of the common good.</comment>

<comment>Excellent article Conor Friedersdorf.  I enjoyed reading it.  Thanks, K.</comment>

<comment>The same guys you demonize daily as slave-owners? You people change your tune very quickly.</comment>

<comment>Same tune, there is no denying that they were progressives.  Given a choice between an unacceptable status quo and a better future, they chose the latter.  They then went on to create a government based upon the most progressive ideas of their day.  One which was always intended to permit continued progress as the rest of the society caught up with them.I guess that's hard to accept when one only looks out the rear window though.</comment>

<comment>George Washington would have had contempt for you progressives - with your affirmative action, safe spaces, gay marriage and mass Islamic immigration.</comment>

<comment>Your thinking is brutally anachronistic.  Those issues and our society did not exist then, so there is no way of determining the validity of any of it.  What did exist were progressive thinkers committed to the most liberal ideas on government of their day.At bottom, we're contemplating intellectual viewpoints.  Backward-looking thinkers lost hard - eventually, they always do.</comment>

<comment>You are way off-base. Nazism and Stalinism were  very progressive ideologies, and very forward-thinking.  Also, very evil and very misguided.And they went into the dustbin of history,  just like American 21st dentury progressivism.</comment>

<comment>"Nazism and Stalinism were very progressive ideologies"Yes, progressive ideologies that were perverted into backward-thinking monarchaic governments.  You know, a charismatic leader told the people what they wanted to hear to gain power, that used that authority to abandon the ideas, consolidate, and maintain power? Just like in the old days - even used the "make the country great again rhetoric".  That's why the fundamental, progressive ideal of nations of laws - not men, prevailed again and again.</comment>

<comment>Oh - how original- the "Trump is a Nazi" gambit.Right, because he believes in patriotism.  I remember when you knuckleheads were calling Reagan a Nazi, too.It didn't work out well for you then - and it won't now either.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say anybody was a Nazi.</comment>

<comment>Systems of government that put all the power (and wealth) into the hands of like 10 people while they eliminate political opponents without due process are progressive?? Sounds like monarchy or despotism or a dictatorship. Quit listening to Rush Limbaugh. Progressive is just a word.</comment>

<comment>Ever heard of super-delegates? Which party has those- and which party assigns delegates on the basis of popular vote?</comment>

<comment>You're really comparing super-delegates, which work within and through a democratic process, and nazis? Really?</comment>

<comment>You must be talking to somebody else about something else.</comment>

<comment>ExactlyWhy else in the rest of the English speaking world is the nickname for a conservative a 'Tory'?</comment>

<comment>The people against continuing slavery were progressives. the people wanting to maintain the status quo were conservatives. Those are basic definitions.</comment>

<comment>So, Thomas Jefferson and George Washington were conservatives, is that the way of it?</comment>

<comment>Have you ever heard of people who are fiscally conservative and socially liberal? People can be a mix. That's one reason people like spud, who paint the entire opposition as one monolithic block, don't get taken seriously.</comment>

<comment>On the single issue of slavery, yes, they were conservatives.  On many other issues, they were progressives.</comment>

<comment>America isn't a nation. It is a country founded by British citizens who rebelled against paying taxes. Does that sound 'progressive' to you?</comment>

<comment>Religious freedom was a progressive idea. The idea that anyone could become president and the pool was not limited to the royal family was a progressive idea.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution itself was a progressive idea.  In fact, the primary objections to it were that it wasn't progressive enough, so the Bill of Rights had to be added to make it even more so.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  What's also interesting is that for a while now progressives have been saying there are ways to make our country even greater than it is already, and the right wing claims this is "blaming America first." Now they have a joker in the pack with secret, probably goofy, ideas about how to "make America great again" they can't get enough. I wish the idiots in the outlying ten percent of each party could let the grownups in the center get along. We really do have a lot in common.</comment>

<comment>Which is why the government they created dos not impose taxes on anyone. Oh wait, that's the opposite of what happened. Maybe the story is a bit more complicated than that. </comment>

<comment>Actually the largest group of Americans are German-Americans.  At the time of the Revolutionary War, there were also many folks here from Ireland, Scotland, and the "Scots-Irish" (Scottish lowlanders sent to Ireland by England, then basically evicted 100 years later with nowhere to go).  Throw in plenty of French - did you know the deciding battle against the British involved MORE French troops (naval) than American soldiers?  I don't believe the non-Brits on American colony soil @ time of Revo War were technically British citizens.  You also have to consider the French, Spanish, and Native American residents of the Louisiana Purchase territories and northern Mexico (all eventually brought into the US fold thanks to Manifest Destiny).The English were also guilty of a little forgotten (over here) genocidal campaign in the 1800s against the Irish that intentionally killed 5,000,000+.America surely had plenty of ex-Brits ticked off over taxes... but for every one of them, there were of a couple of ancestors (like mine) that despised England much as Trump despises ISIS today.  But now it's forgotten - people and cultures can change.  I even like Prince Harry. </comment>

<comment>Once again, we see a proponent of "political incorrectness" who believes that opinions and attitudes contrary to his own ought to be criminalized and punished.</comment>

<comment>I never said progressivism should be criminalized.</comment>

<comment>You  accuse them of treason, and treason is a crime.</comment>

<comment>Treason has been on the books for two centuries - no need to criminalize anything.</comment>

<comment>So you don't believe progressive thought should be criminalized, but you do think they ought to be prosecuted according to existing laws.Not much of a difference, Brown Shirt.</comment>

<comment>If progressives pass a law allowing illegal aliens to vote in NYC - they should be prosecuted for treason.</comment>

<comment>Even if it's not actually treason.The founding fathers, in their wisdom, set the bar particularly high when it come to convicting people for the crime of treason.They did that because of people like you, who would hit the "treason" button at the drop of the hat.</comment>

<comment>and as for all of the "illegals" that have washed up on our shores for over a century and now vote? most likely my great-great grandparents and your's as well? what of them? oh they're not mexican. right.</comment>

<comment>Your lame excuse sounds like what the shirtless guys on the TV show "Cops" say when they get caught - "Everybody is doing it, man!".</comment>

<comment>I think we need a new reality show where Trump is water boarded every week.</comment>

<comment>I'd prefer a show where Tim Cook is water boarded until he unlocks that terrorists cell phone.</comment>

<comment>BAZINGA!!!Except, no enema for Timmy- he would like that too much.</comment>

<comment>Do you think Trump knows what danger he has put his family in by running for president in the way that he has done? Does he care?</comment>

<comment>Are you threatening the leading presidential candidate's family? Do you have any idea of the danger that puts you in?</comment>

<comment>Not at all. I hope he and they remain safe. I am pointing out that in using such sweeping violence tinged language he risks harm to his family. He is thoughtless and impulsive and seems to ignore the harm is has caused or may cause, even to his own family.Don't you care about the sacrifices he is imposing on his family for the sake of his own self-aggrandizement?</comment>

<comment>I disagree. I could see Ivanka pulling a Marine LePen.</comment>

<comment>She is an orthodox Jew and would not appreciate the comparison.</comment>

<comment>The first step the Atlantic must take to stop being made fun of as PC hacks would be to stop being PC hacks.So for instance when you purposely omit the "temporary" part of Trump's Muslim immigration policy in this article it changes the policy completely.  When people end up comparing what Trump said to what you claim Trump said they discover you were lying.</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic prints stories with deliberate misquotes, distortions and exaggerations of Trump's words almost every day.I have pointed out many of them in my posts - as many other readers have also done.</comment>

<comment>YeahI should say they aren't intentionally lying all the timeTheir PC idiocy caused their brain to shut off when they read Trump's immigration policy.   They saw the words muslim and ban and that's all they can see.</comment>

<comment>"In a written statement late Monday afternoon, the Trump campaign said the Republican frontrunner wanted a “total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.”http://www.theatlantic.com/pol...or"Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has released his first, long-promised campaign ad: a spot that touts his controversial proposal to ban Muslims from entering the US “until we can figure out what’s going on”.http://www.theguardian.com/us-...</comment>

<comment>Temporary for how long and until what happens? What did Trump say?</comment>

<comment>Temporary until the screening process is re-workedDid you actually not know that?  Because if so then I suggest you seek out better sources of news</comment>

<comment>No that isn't what he said. He said "until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on".See the difference between that and what you wrote?</comment>

<comment>Your ignorance of reality does not change realityThis is the main fallacy of PC</comment>

<comment>That is what he said in a press release. Do you realize that that proposal would stop all travel to the US because passports do not contain any religious identification? You need to learn to think and not just accept what people say when it sounds right.</comment>

<comment>Well of course, we are just supposed to take the word of the man who is the self-proclaimed master of the contract loopholes that he clearly means "temporary" when what he actually said was "until  our country's representatives can figure out what is going on". It's the same thing with immigration. No path to legalization or citizenship until we get illegal immigration "under control". Just what exactly they mean by this is never explained. My read on this means that until we can absolutely demonstrate to the last Fox New idiot that there couldn't possibly be even one illegal immigrant. Or until we drive the risk of foreign terrorism to absolute zero. Until then, no one gets in (except white christians).</comment>

<comment>don't worry the only people to draw that comparison would be conservatives, and they don't read. now if it was screamed on Fox News and then O'Reilly said cut his mic, and then he put the quote on a graphic and read it aloud to the viewers, they might then get it.</comment>

<comment>I think the long reader quote hits the gist of Trump's appeal..people's eyes are open that politics is a sham, no one means what they say and no one does what they say they will, it's a complete house of lies from beginning to end, Republican or Democrat.I was at a dinner party recently, one person is voting for Trump because he wants to see as much "chaos" as possible, another couple didn't say they were voting for Trump, they're typical Blue State moderate Democrats, supported ACA, they talked about Ted Cruz being over the top and how they despise Hillary Clinton, they did not outright say they would vote for Trump...but I was left with a sense they'd either vote for Trump, vote for Sanders [which would be suicidal considering their tax bracket] or not vote.  Everyone agreed the system is broken.</comment>

<comment>This morning I was listening to NPR.  They were interviewing a wealthy Bush campaign donor and organizer.The guy was absolutely indignant that the public dared to repudiate his personally selected establishment puppet.He also refused ( STILL!) to admit that this was the will of the public.  He had the nerve to claim that bad campaign management was responsible for the fact that Bush was not wrapping up the nomination right now.</comment>

<comment>"vote for Sanders [which would be suicidal considering their tax bracket]"Thank you for that [probably unintentionally] highly revelatory observation.You are surely right; a conservative would, in all likelihood, equate having to pay in income taxes a whopping 39% of his marginal income above $450k (you know, what they survivably paid during the last big economic boom, that of the mid-to-late-'90s, when everyone but the top 1/10 of 1% were doing much better than now) with "suicide."A liberal might -- possibly -- whine a bit, but would more likely deem it an entirely appropriate price for "buy[ing] civilization*," as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr, put it.*The full quote was:  "I like paying taxes.  With them, I buy civilization."And FDR said, “Taxes, after all, are dues that we pay for the privileges of membership in an organized society.”The calumny that liberals like spending OTHER people's money on bettering the world is another Publican lie.  We're happy to spend our own, too, knowing the whole society demonstrably works better that way -- and always has.</comment>

<comment>My state takes 6.3% off the top if you make more than $75K in state income taxes.  We pay the highest property taxes in the country, the average being between $7K-$8K.  The sales tax is 7%.So, please, spare me your superior attitude.</comment>

<comment>I started reading this article and then I just stopped after a few paragraphs.  It is un-readable.  The author is a Trump hater of the first order and is determined never to write a serious article about Trump.  The people that read this crap and agree with him are probably Trump haters already.   Are we to believe that someone who already hated Trump, viscerally, 8 months ago, before the campaign even started, is going to review the past eight months in any kind of thoughtful and objective way?  I don't think so.Remember, Trump is a business icon whose major crime was he hosted a very successful reality TV show about commerce, of all things.Normal people like reality TV shows -- it is why they are popular and successful.   The news is reality TV.  Politics is reality TV.  Needless to say, reality TV probably has more integrity than liberal journalism.The subtext is clear.  If you belong to the class of people who like reality TV, and who think a business leader would make a great president, then the politico-class hates you.</comment>

<comment>If you struggle with reading comprehension, and that is something relatively recent, you should mention that to your doctor on your next visit. If you can remember that.</comment>

<comment>So in other words, the media ought to be censored and negative portrayals of Donald Trump should not be printed.I personally love the irony that all these champions of "political incorrectness" invariably thin skinned and can't tolerate even the slightest criticism.</comment>

<comment>No, that is not what I mean.  I can understand why people do not like Trump.  I expect this to be a close election with 50% going Democrat and 50% going Trump.  I plan to write a lot of negative things about the Democrat.</comment>

<comment>May not be what you meant, but it's certainly what you wrote.</comment>

<comment>Then you cannot read.</comment>

<comment>You cannot write.  You're technically literate, but you can't string words together to accurately express what you're thinking.Don't worry about it though, it really is harder than it seems.</comment>

<comment>You said I called for censorship.  Copy and paste my sentence that endorses this.  Prove you are not retarded.</comment>

<comment>The fact that you're going the "exact words" route proves that you don't really understand what you wrote.You think the Atlantic is wrong for publishing "Trump hater" articles.  What's the remedy for that?  A policy that says articles critical of Trump should not be published, ie censorship.When you attack the author or the publication for what they write instead of the content of the article, you are arguing for censorship, even if you don't use the exact words.</comment>

<comment>Are you denying that he is a Trump hater?</comment>

<comment>Are you denying that you think the Atlantic should not publish articles written by "Trump haters"?</comment>

<comment>Of course.  I never said such a thing.  You are an idiot.</comment>

<comment>May not be what you meant to say, but it's what you wrote.And with that, we've come full circle.</comment>

<comment>Again, copy and paste, it's your friend.</comment>

<comment>The remedy would be for the media to employ the objectivity that they now feign.  The problem isn't that the media "hates" Trump, the problem is their coverage is biased but there is no admission of the agenda that exists.  The fact of noticing that there is an agenda at work isn't any kind of a call for censorship.</comment>

<comment>And who made you the objectivity police?  Who decides what's "objective" and what isn't?  If an article isn't objective should it not be published, and how is that not censorship?</comment>

<comment>You're kind of debating with yourself here, as nobody has mentioned censoring the press.  Every consumer can judge objectivity for themselves, as they judge truth and lies and equivocation for themselves.  I judge that The Atlantic has lost the mantle of objectivity on many issues, this web site routinely presents 'articles' that are poorly researched, which put forth very standard progressive positions and talking points based on shaky data and biased interpretations which are presented as if they are objective facts and not opinions.  It's a shame.  Objectivity in the media, and fair analysis are a great public good that no longer exists.</comment>

<comment>You think that if you don't use the word censorship then it's not censorship.  You also seem to believe that you have some sort of infallible "objectivity detector" and anyone who disagrees with you isn't being objective.</comment>

<comment>All you do is project, criticizing The Atlantic for presenting biased, slanted pieces as objective fact is not calling for censorship in any language, but you appear to wish to categorize anyone who holds this opinion as advocating for censorship, even though no one is doing this.  So, I think there is no point in this discussion.I have many times in the comments sections pointed out the flawed interpretations, weak research and faulty reasoning that exists in the content, in my opinion.  That's kind of what the comments section is for, ya know, people comment on the content.</comment>

<comment>Oh no, anonymous internet commenter might write a blog post that is anti-Democrat.</comment>

<comment>right back at you...</comment>

<comment>I'm getting really cynical in my middle age. When I think of political correctness, I can't help but think of the following scenario:A guy working for the Preserve Insects Society (hopefully this isn't a real thing :) ) is sitting around in his office watching TMZ. A celebrity comes on the air and tells an anecdote about killing a spider.The guy smiles and claps his hands. Why? Not because he loves insects but hates arachnids. It's because he can use this interview to get publicity for his cause. A couple of tweets later, and his post quoting said celebrity is picked up by the news media. His donations skyrocket.Basically, an army of people are just waiting to pounce in order to use anything that can be taken possibly wrong as ammunition to support their cause.I hate the effect that has had on society. It's like we can't be civil to each other any more. That hypothetical actress is likely to get freaking death threats over killing a spider. Really?Therefore, it's with a certain amount of glee that I watch someone who so thoroughly doesn't give a crap about any blowback from his outrageous statements.Understand that Trump is harnessing the power of the pendulum. The pendulum of political correctness has moved way, way too far to one side, and it's reached a point where a lot of people are seriously ticked off by it.  It's high time that the pendulum swings back in the opposite direction so that we can eventually settle back into a reasonable middle position.</comment>

<comment>The only time I am aware that Americans were civil to each other was maybe during WWII when the external threat was so serious that everybody had to drop what ever else they were doing to focus on it.</comment>

<comment>It's definitely possible that I'm suffering from the delusion of "the good ol' days."  That being said, the pendulum argument, imo, is legit.</comment>

<comment>So the civilian assaults on black troops was what, just being neighbourly?</comment>

<comment>Good comment.</comment>

<comment>I must call you out for your highly questionable analogy.You are clearly articulate enough, and thus intelligent enough, to realize that what Trump rails against as the horrors of "PC" is not about people killing spiders, but about people thinking it's okay to derogate (or, in some cases, even physically attack)...all womenall poor peopleall undocumented immigrantsall people of colorall Muslimsall GLBTQ peopleall differently-abled peopleand that's just off the top of my head; I'm sure there are some other marginalized groups that Trump and his followers loathe, and see no need to treat, or talk about or to, with even minimal standards of respect.</comment>

<comment>There is a big difference in speaking against people who are saying actually vile things and condemning people for not wording things in the best possible way.Look at that rapper Bernie supporter who was accused of being anti woman just because his tweet could possibly be misconstrued if you weren't familiar with the context of the situation. This is condemning a person for not being particularly good at wording a tweet.When you elevate such trivial misstatements to the level of hate speech, you set up a situation where there's going to be blowback. If any little thing you say is going to be taken to be offensive, why worry about being offensive at all?Trump is using that blowback to his advantage.</comment>

<comment>Another Trump article focusing on behavior, and not issues. Case in point. This week, the Carrier Corporation, the American Inventor of modern air conditioning, announced two plant closings in Indiana, Over two thousand Americans are now unemployed. The jobs are being moved to Mexico. Two thousand once productive citizens now need assistance. That's a big gain for Carrier shareholders and executives, and a big loss for Indiana. There is exactly one candidate that understands that is a net negative for our country, and isn't afraid to say so. Trump supporters are not ideology driven. Follow the issues for a better understanding of their mindset.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  Trump gave a press conference on that, and said that he would slap a 35% tariff on a company that did that.Atlantic predictably ignored it.  Maybe their big-corporate globalist advertisers don't like that kind of talk.</comment>

<comment>A punitive tariff against a single law-abiding company?  Going to have to get Congress to pass a law authorizing that - good luck.</comment>

<comment>Actually he can. The President has broad discretion on trade adjustments with China. The company might sue, but it would be in the courts for a while.</comment>

<comment>"The President has broad discretion on trade adjustments with China."Which would apply to punishing an American company that moves jobs to Mexico how exactly?</comment>

<comment>There are plenty of articles explaining how Trump could accomplish his agenda through activist executive authority. You can look them up or we can exchange vacuous banalities.</comment>

<comment>Company is moving to Mexico not China. Congressional approval would be required. Trumpists seem to forget that they need to get rid of the corporation owned members of Congress too. That is both parties but currently leans Republican.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't that be a bill of attainder? If so, that's banned by the constitution.</comment>

<comment>No need whatsoever to tailor a tariff to a single company. Strawman.</comment>

<comment>Trump said to the NYT  he would put a tariff of 45% on all goods imported from China. http://www.nytimes.com/politic...Do you think that would be a good idea? (It would double the cost of a lot of products.)</comment>

<comment>yes a GREAT idea. And most of the Chinese people I work with agree.</comment>

<comment>So you will pay double for stuff and that will make you happy. Not many people would like that. If they did, there would b no Walmart.Tariff walls were tried in the 1930's and they didn't make things better.</comment>

<comment>You are too stupid to see the big picture - with a return to better paying jobs.Walmart prices are only needed if you make Walmart wages.</comment>

<comment>Don't you get that the reason that wages are low is that people like Trump and the GOP and the Koch brothers have all but eliminated unions and rigged that tax system to reward capital and not labour?Trump sells luxury goods to very rich people. He has golf resorts and hotels all over the world.  Inequality helps him. He pays as little as he can to the people he employs.</comment>

<comment>No, stupid. God you are ignorant.Progressives  and their RINO enablers created the problem by encouraging illegal immigration, offshoring and free trade.</comment>

<comment>Don't call people stupid and ignorant because they disagree with you. Make a substantive argument against what I claimed.</comment>

<comment>So Reagan was a RINO. Well, it had to happen eventually.</comment>

<comment>This is a meaningless talking point.  If you look at Congress over the last 40 years the split between Democratic and GOP majorities is pretty close.  Thus, blaming U.S. tax policy, trade policy and regulations on "Trump/GOP/Koch Brothers" is um, how shall I say, inaccurate.Indeed, the tax system rewards capital and not labor, it rewards capital that creates no value in the real economy, but both parties are to blame.</comment>

<comment>If you look at the data on what tax polices enacted by Republicans have been you will see that they have reduced tax on investment and corporations and not on wages. The result has been a transfer of wealth from the median and below to to the 1%  and .1%. At the same time the Republicans when in control have cut transfers. There is a clear relationship between Republican party policies and growth of inequality. Only during Clinton and Obama has this trend reversed or at least slowed.The destruction of unions has undermined the wage and benefits that made the blue collar worker middle class.What labour has lost finance capital has gained in shares of productivity growth.</comment>

<comment>You understand that the derivatives market was created under Bill Clinton and he declined to regulate it or propose any regulations.  Obama's regulations are toothless and appear to have some very strange priorities, with more effort being spent on ensuring gender and ethnic parity on Wall Street than on reigning in hedge funds and other unsavory financial practices.So, I remain unconvinced.  I could make a strong case for the blame lying at the foot of the Democrats and progressives since the larger the government's reach is, the more prevalent will be efforts to game the system, and that Big Government rewards Big Business because it takes deep pockets to lobby for regulations that favor your company/industry and that the crony capitalistic state we have now is a direct result of over regulation and over reach by the federal government.  Of course no one but libertarians ever recognize this, certainly not progressives, their solution is always more of what currently fails.</comment>

<comment>"You understand that the derivatives market was created under Bill Clinton and he declined to regulate it or propose any regulations.""the crony capitalistic state we have now is a direct result of over regulation and over reach by the federal government."Uh, OK.You do realize that what Trump is proposing is also government regulation of businesses.</comment>

<comment>"Of course no one but libertarians ever recognize this,"Derivative and unregulated and fraudulently rated bank reserves are different problems, both of which contributed to the financial collapse.Tax changes and cuts in transfers are what expanded the inequality.Clinton has been for derivatives regulation since 2008.Libertarians are for the elimination of all regulations, and the end to the FED.</comment>

<comment>I can't agree with that completely, increasing inequality is occurring because the "real" economy and the "fake Wall Street" economy are disconnected, so a tiny group of people make windfalls via stock prices, hedging and all the rest of it, while the middle class continues to lose ground, and the gov. has done nothing to address this problem.How nice that Clinton's hindsight on derivatives is 20/20, LOL.Not all libertarians are for elimination of "all" regulations, but if you ask me, the Fed has done the middle class no favors by shoveling money hand over fist into the bankers pockets and hoping some benefit trickles down to the rest of us.  Trying to fix the economy through monetary policy alone is never going to succeed, which is why, everyone who wasn't already part of the top 10% is still in trouble.  Negative interest rates are the last gasp of a failed policy, or may be second to last gasp....</comment>

<comment>Libertarians are against regulations of the financial markets, banks and the economy in general. They would eliminate the Fed, eliminate the SEC, eliminate the IRS and institute a flat tax that would be deeply regressive.If you object to TARP, that was necessary at the time to prevent the complete collapse of the world economy. In such a collapse the everyone suffers except the top 10%. The money was paid back and the Treasury made a substantial profit.If you mean quantitative easing that was necessary because Congress and the States were contracting the economy by cutting budgets. Its effective zero interest rate cuts bank profits and by reducing the spread on loans and that is why they want higher not lower rates even though there is no inflation and plenty of slackOnly the Democrats remain as Keynesian, the Republicans and libertarians are completely off the way with crackpot theories like returning to the gold standard.</comment>

<comment>But, that's not an issue, that's an occurrence.  For it to be an "issue" to debate, Trump would actually have to do more than say. "It's bad", and offer what can be done to make it better.  You know, a policy or a plan?</comment>

<comment>THANK YOU!</comment>

<comment>Good comment. If someone really doesn't like Trump, it seems like a better idea to rationally determine why he's so successful instead of reacting to his behavior.My observations (which may be completely incorrect) on why he's doing so well:1. Charisma. This quality is way underrated. People want to believe that there's a big difference between running from president of your senior class in high school and running for president of the USA. I'm not sure that that is the case. Look at Bubba, W, and Obama versus the people they ran against. All of them had much more charisma that their opponents.2. A strong feeling that the Republican Party has been bought by Big Money and couldn't care less about the plight of the middle class. It seems like Trump's voters couldn't care less about what he says or how he says it; the important thing is that he seems to be the only one who might actually try to improve their lives.</comment>

<comment>What about Bernie?</comment>

<comment>I find it amusing when Trump followers think they're sticking it to "librals" by voting for him.  The fact is, cool-headed, progressive thinkers don't actually fear the effects of a Trump presidency. His gut level positions on many issues are pretty far left.  Moreover, almost none of the more outlandish things he's suggested can or will be done.  A lack of money from Congress and our willingness to go to the courts to maintain Constitutional protections means, for example, no wall, no deportation squads, no barring Muslims, etc.Such voters are, however, causing great damage to the advances of the conservative movement and the Republican Party.  Those are the folks they're thumbing their noses to (or should I say, feet they're shooting?).  A flash-in-the-pan celebrity at the top of the ticket doesn't help down the ballot, and doesn't help the party maintain the positions it's fought so hard to achieve.  Trump is Mitch McConnell's worst nightmare - not Nancy Pilosi'sThe thing is, what's troubling to us is not the Trump candidacy, but the manic Trump supporters.  His success makes us acknowledge the ugly truths about the ignorance and gullibility of many of our neighbors.  We thought they were smarter than that - or, at least, not SO dumb.  It's disheartening to be reminded daily of how wrong we were.</comment>

<comment>The ones who are manic are the people with Trump Derangement Syndrome.-Trump's position about Muslim immigration is nothing special.  The way he phrases it is what gets PC nuts like the author on their PC high horse.-Mexican migrants do bring abnormally high levels of crime and rape.  Trump never said "all Mexicans are rapists", which is what the PC media repeats like a mantra.-Trump's position on torture is no different than Dick Cheney's.</comment>

<comment>As I said, it's not progressives who are most concerned about the impact of a Trump presidency.  Nor, who will ultimately be hurt by it.  The Constitution is on our side and overreach is preventable.As to one of your points:"Trump's position on torture is no different that Dick Cheney's."Yes.  It's just as ill-informed and illegal.</comment>

<comment>I really do not like his or Cheney's position on torture.  That said, it is blown WAY out of proportion, as is everything that Trump says.  This is unfortunate and an abdication of the duties of the press...  I have no faith in the press anymore.</comment>

<comment>On this, at least, I think we are all in agreement.</comment>

<comment>You are justifying Trump's position on torture because it is the same as Cheney's??!!?? </comment>

<comment>The two corporate owned parties are corporate owned. There is no movement in either one.</comment>

<comment>And, absolutely nothing about a Trump presidency or candidacy will do anything to change those facts.  A cult of personality devoid of concrete ideas will not lead to institutional reform.  Trump certainly hasn't articulated that he want to lead such a reformation - he just wants the job.  Business as usual will continue around him.</comment>

<comment>I've always thought that Trumps big jump to being a conservative is a fraud to a certain extent. I do not believe that he would work to outlaw Roe v Wade and he is also very pro healthcare for all. As a progressive, I would not vote for Trump, but I'm not nearly as afraid of The Donald as I am of the Weasel from Texas and his Dominionist outlook.</comment>

<comment>If you are a liberal, then Cruz is the one to be worried about, that is certain.</comment>

<comment>Since Sen Cruz appears to be loathed by his fellow Republican leaders at least as much as, if not more than, by us moonbat types, I don't think we really have to worry that much about the prospect of a Cruz Presidency.The little Rubot is the one who's keeping more of us up nights -- with JEB? gone, the establishment Publicans appear to be coalescing about him, and they have almost always gotten what they want in your candidates.</comment>

<comment>And Rubot has all the worst ideas of Consevatives only more so. Trump would be much much better for progressives.</comment>

<comment>Civility and tolerance are not political correctness; they are essential for political incorrectness to thrive. If someone is afraid of losing their reputation, economic opportunities, or physical safety because of expressing unpopular, politically incorrect views, then they won't express those views.Thus, Trump is just enforcing his own brand of political correctness. When he throws people out of his events because of the views they were expressing, or calls for shutting down the Internet because of the views being shared there, he is just trying to shut down what he sees as politically incorrect views.</comment>

<comment>But doesn't conservative political correctness show how stupid all political correctness is?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I agree that all political correctness is stupid. My point is that when someone threatens or economically or physically attack people with different views, they are contributing to political correctness. Also, that political correctness exists on both sides of the spectrum--like this article's discussion about how criticism of US foreign policy or Israel will get you just as much nastiness from some people on the right that criticism of critical race theory will get you from SJWs.</comment>

<comment>What a liar you are.  The people who get kicked out of his events want to shut the events down for the 20,000 people who attend.  The 20,000 who attend have a first amendment right to hear what the speaker says.  These jack-booted thugs want to deny the first amendment rights of Trump and everyone else.</comment>

<comment>They're protesting his events and what he's saying. Not even close to being a first amendment issue. </comment>

<comment>Liar. The FA allows for peaceful protests.  It does not protect you from denying the FA rights of others.  Those thugs should be thrown in jail. If conservatives did that to Obama, then you'd want them thrown in jail.</comment>

<comment>Obama has hecklers removed all the time.</comment>

<comment>I wonder why the press doesn't say anything?</comment>

<comment>They only show it on the news when a relatively mild heckler shouts something mildly offensive, brief and easy to refute - then Obama waves his hands magnanimously and says "No, let him speak" and then does him comeback.The other kind of hecklers are not filmed or reported on much - but are still googleable, luckily, so we know about them.</comment>

<comment>I agree that hecklers and protesters disrupting events should be removed. Trump has been known to go overboard on talking about them but that's just part of his shtick. </comment>

<comment>Every candidate, Hillary in particular has hecklers removed. Else the right to conduct lawful assembly is abridged. This criticism is disingenuous on your part.</comment>

<comment>Civility and tolerance are not political correctness, yes...but PC is much more than civility and tolerance.</comment>

<comment>Trump is rejecting civility and tolerance and excusing his crudeness by calling those virtues PC. It's very hard to have meaningful discussions when everyone is screaming insults at each other and Trump's example is spreading throughout the entire campaign.</comment>

<comment>Nice in theory, but where do you draw the line and who goes along with?Too many on the left think asking someone "where are you from," or even mentioning reducing immigration (or even, lets say, opposing yet another increase, or changing some aspect of policy), makes you an irretrievable "nativist, xenophobe, restrictionist!" that needs to be twitter stormed, etcc. out of existence. In that environment who even speaks up?Convince the other side to allow some kind of debate on certain issues, immigration rates and policies being one, and then you reduce the appeal of a Trump, but how do you do that? Its a big weapon, one the other side will be loathe to give up.</comment>

<comment>Yes, we seem to be left with two horrible choices...by our own choosing. There has not been in my lifetime a more qualified set of Republican candidates and yet the yahoos have decided Trump (as a reaction to PC and progressive idiocy) is the solution.I mourn for the country.</comment>

<comment>In the end what American society needs most is a new understanding that bigotry and prejudice are neutral, not bad thingsSometimes you need them, sometimes you don't</comment>

<comment>Everything can be done to excess. But you don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. There's no cause for a massive backlash against a benign combination of good old-fashioned manners and simple sensitivity toward others. So when people go to far with it, just not "I think the other side has valid points and you are taking it to far." People speed, and we don't ban cars. People get too drunk; we don't outlaw alcohol (well, we did once, and it was a disaster). It's a bad idea to define anything by its excesses.</comment>

<comment>The establishment and the status quo certainly thrive in political correctness. We can't talk about how free trade has destroyed the middle class because that would offend foreigners and be nationalist. We can't talk about how immigration and work visas are used to suppress wages and break down social cohesion because that would be xenophobic. We can't talk about how Islamist want to impose a theocracy because that would Islamaphobia...and on and on and on.From the perspective of the elite establishment PC limits on speech are very useful. Its no wonder this type of censorship is fostered in government run schools and elite schools. </comment>

<comment>TotoCatcher - You can discuss all of those topics without being accused of anything, as long as the discussion is based on facts instead of emotion and you talk with specificity instead of painting with a broad brush.</comment>

<comment>If we're going to have a conversation on this, it has to be honest on all sides.Toto may be exaggerating, but there's no question that there are some commenters who will do exactly what Toto has called out.They're not helping the situation either, and we can neither wish them away nor pretend they don't exist.Note:  I am not in any way trying to make one of those "both sides do it" arguments; that's a clearly false equivalence.  But we do have our extremists to acknowledge -- and to call out when they go overboard.</comment>

<comment>Trump supporters are going with a gut feeling.  They want an easy solution to a very complex problem.  They want him to bust his way through our constitutional checks and balances (by intimidating people?) and "fix" things for them (not for other Americans of course, just for them and those in their likeness).The problem is that democracy is messy and inefficient.  It is ultimately an ongoing experiment.  But like capitalism, with all its flaws what is the better alternative?For Trump supporters though it's not about logic or principle.  They are frustrated and would have us crown Trump king because they are somehow convinced that because he is aligning himself with them now to get votes, he will be the champion of their cause (a huge leap!), and will solve all their problems pronto (wishful thinking!)The tragic irony is that Trump's supporters will learn soon enough that Trump doesn't have all the answers either.  In his narcissism he is setting himself up for an epic fail, and is dragging the country down with him.</comment>

<comment>In other words, he's doing what almost every politician does</comment>

<comment>This isn't normal electioneering, he's taking like a dictator who will be on their side.</comment>

<comment>please</comment>

<comment>uh, no.that kind of cynicism is also dragging the country down.  are we that willing to give up on democracy?</comment>

<comment>You want democracy? Then actually allow real debates on things like immigration and quit shutting down people you disagree with and calling them names. Deal? Can you handle that?</comment>

<comment>Are you confusing me with someone else perhaps?  Rolling me in with anyone who has ever disagreed with you?I don't call people names or shut people down if they don't agree with me (feel free to browse my history)I completely agree we need real debates on issues of immigration and other things.It's easy to conflate issues as you do here, but it doesn't lead to any kind of rational discussion or broadening of perspective.</comment>

<comment>But that is exactly what Trump is doing. Calling anyone who disagrees with or questions him names.</comment>

<comment>"The problem is that democracy is messy and inefficient. It is ultimately an ongoing experiment. But like capitalism, with all its flaws what is the better alternative?"The alternatives to both are hybrids.  Our government is one.  As you know, it's not a true democracy.  Likewise, our economy is not really "capitalism".  Neither of these concepts work in reality, so we mitigate their most dangerous effects.</comment>

<comment>naturally, which is why i, unlike CF am not a libertarian.</comment>

<comment>Great comment.</comment>

<comment>Hmm. Sounds like Sanders supporters.</comment>

<comment>actually yes, but substitue blind idealism for narcissism</comment>

<comment>True, idealism and narcissism describe the respective candidates, but the voters from both camps fit your original description.[Though, I suspect Sanders' idealism is a ruse much like Trump's blowhardiness.]</comment>

<comment>I think Sander's idealism is the real deal . He hasn't changed his stances in 30 years. Trump's blow hardiness is who is is. He is proving to be a very effective politicians for this time in history. Whether that would translate into a good president is unknowable right now.</comment>

<comment>WrongThe problem with democracy is that it values every citizen's opinion equallyEven a flawed monarchy, with a tyrannical king, is still a superior system than a democratic one</comment>

<comment>i'll give conor credit for attempting to come up with a solution to the village idiot dumbing down political discourse, but it won't work.trump's entire life has been spent denigrating others and behaving in a manner unfit for civilised company. He has correctly deduced that there is a large swath of the electorate who feel perpetually aggrieved and don't care how one behaves in public. This same constituency also believes in the idea of a 'strong man' and is perfectly suited to trump's style and preferred medium of communication.  It is a perfect (shyte) storm.</comment>

<comment>Correction,  He only denigrated Rosy O'Donell , who attacked him first in a quite vicious manner.</comment>

<comment>Trump has brought out the true feelings of a fairly substantial portion of the US population. They long to be as successful and regard his blunders as proof that he's not perfect - just like them. A role model who has become their mouthpiece.</comment>

<comment>A role model who is a crass, self centered bullyYep, that's about right. </comment>

<comment>yep</comment>

<comment>Talking about the Clintons?</comment>

<comment>"a fairly substantial portion of the US population."Respectfully disagree with this characterization.Trump's pulling, at most, no more than -- and I'm being generous here -- about 40% of those who identify to pollsters as Republicans or Republican-leaning voters.  (I'm pretty confident that those who say he will continue to top out there are right; the rest of the Publicans seem to feel no better about him than we do.)  Those groups subtend no more than 47% of the electorate (which is itself no more than about 60% of the adult population).But let's say that the 47% figure applies to ALL Americans, not just those who actually vote.  It still means that Trump's support is limited to 40% of 47%, or 19% of the populace.That's less than one-in-five, and not much more than one-in-six.Now, we already knew that, even after the Iraq debacle became clear and undeniable to even the most strident true-believers, even after the failures of 9/11 were widely known, even after Katrina (!), there were still about 27% of us who just loved GWB!So, in such parlous times, with only 19% of us in thrall to Mein Trumpf, I think Americans, on the whole, are still perfectly intelligent, decent, and sane.(Of course, you'll notice I've left out the Cruz contingent.  Leave me my delusions...  At least they probably won't switch to Trump.)</comment>

<comment>It's a matter of semantics, but I am sticking to my interpretation. Even your lowest number of 19% constitutes a "substantial portion" of the US population. If, for example, 19% of the population was HIV positive, would you not say that's "substantial"?</comment>

<comment>I'm as shocked by Trump's rise as anyone, but I think CF is on to something.For decades progressives have been continually lowered the bar for what is considered racist. The full-retard moment for me was when they started throwing around the white privilege label, essentially making every white person guilty by original sin. When complaints of cultural appropriation began to surface, I just quit paying attention.There are a lot of decent working class people who are tired of being accused of racism. Trump is tapping in to that.After crying wolf for so long, complaints of Trump's outrageous speech are falling on deaf ears.Along with the SJW nonsense happening at universities around the country, Trump is blowback.</comment>

<comment>"White privilege" is similar to "global warming" in that they're objectively provable phenomena that were made controversial because of their unfortunate respective names.For years people have denied climate change by saying "it's 20 degees below zero outside, how is that global warming har, har".Now we have people saying "How is it white privilege when I worked hard for everything that I earned?"You did work hard for everything you earned.  However, a black person worked just as hard and they have less to show for it.  The game is rigged against them, and when they lose, someone else has to win, and typically that someone is a white person.It's the word "privilege" that irks people.  It sounds like white people demand and expect preferential treatment.  That is not true.  However, as a population, they do benefit from institutional racism.  The phenomena is real, it just needs a less accusatory name.</comment>

<comment>Big ditto with cultural appropriation and micro-aggressions.</comment>

<comment>Some benefit from it some don't. Some are born poor and die poor. some are homeless. Quit putting people in buckets and pasting loaded terms on them. Its annoying and "objectively" wrong.</comment>

<comment>Not that I want to get into absurdities here, but you brought it up...Take two poor, homeless people -- equally bedraggled looking (and maybe smelling).One white, one black.Each walks into a convenience store somewhere.Which one is more quickly and closely followed?They each ask for a job application.Do you think they'll be treated equally (dis)respectfully?If a cop walks in, and rousts each of them, which is more likely to be treated poorly?  Searched?  Arrested?  Charged with a crime?  Physically assaulted or tased?Even at that level, there are advantages -- which could legitimately be termed "privileges" -- to white skin.I know you're intelligent and knowledgeable enough to be aware of all this.Please tell me you're honest enough to acknowledge it?</comment>

<comment>I don't think that is right. The people who most complain about white privilege are very privileged themselves. </comment>

<comment>What you're doing is called an ad hominem attack.It doesn't matter who "complains the most" about it.  It's something that genuinely exists.</comment>

<comment>Ad hominem? No, just a simple observation. When already privileged people are complaining about privileges, one can assume that they care about enhancing their own privilege at the expense of equality. </comment>

<comment>Who are the "privileged people" you're speaking of?</comment>

<comment>College students at expensive private universities leap instantly to mind. </comment>

<comment>And how does complaining about racism make them more privileged?</comment>

<comment>You are not too sharp.Going to an expensive private college implies that they are privileged. </comment>

<comment>I'll ask again.  How do college students increase their level of privilege by complaining about racism?</comment>

<comment>Many ways:1) Silencing opposing voices2) Justifying their own existing privileges and arguing for increased privilege3) Justifying their lack of concern for individuals who are less fortunate 4) Resume building5) Developing political connections6) Careers in the growing "diversity" bureaucracy in corporations, academia, and governmentPeople who are truly interested in social justice would not waste their time worrying about drunken frat boys' or townies' words, Halloween costumes, or cosmetic treatments at the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater. People who are interested in increasing the power and privilege do.</comment>

<comment>It exists if you are in the middle class. There are poor whites and class matters. Deal with it, its a reality.</comment>

<comment>While that was certainly true decades ago, people who have grown up in the same neighborhoods, gone to the same schools, and work right beside black people know that the white privilege rants are overblown -- especially when the protests are coming from successful white progressives living in overpriced very white progressive cities.Likewise with global warming, BTW. When even scientists who are luke-warmers are treated like Salem witches, the truth pays the price.</comment>

<comment>When people say there's no more racism, I keep coming back to this: "Are Emily and Greg more employable than Lakisha and Jamal?"http://www.politifact.com/pund...</comment>

<comment>What about Bubba and Buford?</comment>

<comment>Sure, but come to Atlanta and take note of the large and expanding number of working class, middle, and upper income black families.You'll find that while they may or may not give their kids distinctive names, they're usually not naming their children something that signals that they want to segregate themselves from middle income ranks.And gasp, there are two parents that go to work, pull their pants up, don't spend time in prison, and don't talk like yahoos that just crawled out of Hicksville or some HUD cesspool.When you live and work where people are making it on their own and breaking stereotypes, SJW whining gets kind of tiresome.</comment>

<comment>I don't doubt that privilege comes along with being part of the white majority. However, if whites are so privileged, why are Asians kicking their butts academically and financially?</comment>

<comment>Again, you're fumbling on the name, not the existence of the phenomena in question.  Institutional racism and discrimination adversely affect black people.  They're held back, so those who aren't black benefit.  The majority of people in this country are white, so they benefit the most.It has nothing to do with what's going on in China or Korea.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me, I meant Asian Americans are kicking the butts of white Americans.</comment>

<comment>And there has been significant progress on reducing the impact. But people who think that it no longer exists at all are in denial. We all have a genetically programmed " fear of the other" even if we are unaware of it. Tolerance comes from education and self awareness.</comment>

<comment>because Asians subconsciously believe in inequality, not equalityMeaning that we move to another country to attain privilege for ourselves, not to be equal with the locals. Same thing has gone on for Chinese settlers in Southeast Asia for centuries, and now look at them</comment>

<comment>But you have to move out of your mom's basement first.</comment>

<comment>The real answer is that blacks continue to have a cultural problem that is not shared with other minorities. Thug/Street culture is antithetical to western values.</comment>

<comment>And you assume that anyone named "Jamal" is a thug.Hate to break it to you, but that's racist.</comment>

<comment>Because 20th century immigration law was hyper-selective about which Asians could settle in the U.S.  The immigrants were largely more educated, skilled or affluent than the median American.  Their children (including me) benefit from that affluence and education.  And benefit from the positive stereotypes attached to their parent's generation when interacting with teachers or employers.</comment>

<comment>Selection bias, you say.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. I'm a white guy in my mid-twenties who works hard and has made a lot of good decisions. I've made many decisions to protect myself from unwise life choices. But I've also been blessed with many advantages through my middle to upper middle class upbringing, and the Christian, Midwestern values I was taught. I try to have the humility to admit that. A lot of people are too black and white in their thinking. It's often both/and with things like this. I don't like when people deny the advantages they have.</comment>

<comment>Sure, you have advantages over someone with a teenage mom, no daddy, and raised by your uneducated grand-ma-ma in a HUD apartment.But, your advantages are not a case of injustice. That someone has crappy parents is not a rope that should be used to tie you down.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand what you're getting at here…?</comment>

<comment>Exactly the point. These are not privileges, they are the fruits of hard work and good decisions in a free and open society that upholds the rule of law and private property.</comment>

<comment>Except the more liberals hammer on about such loaded terms like white privilege the more it alienates and frustrates perfectly innocent whites who have no power over the institutional racism that oppresses so many minorities.They get caught up as collateral damage in these broadsides of guilt and shaming which will only push them further right to absolve themselves or even worse, forge a sense of pride in their privilege and create a desire to enforce it.Pin  a label on someone long enough and they'll start to believe it, call someone an oppressive white ruler and they'll eventually start thinking its their prerogative to fit into their societal definition and deliberately act like they're on top. The same can easily be said to minorities whom the social justice narrative consistently paints them as victims.Adopting too much of an aggressive posture on privilege will simply create a self fulfilling prophesy that will achieve the exact opposite.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that the agenda anyway? Racial Balkanization is pushed by the same liberal elites who will benefit the most from it, no?</comment>

<comment>The game is not rigged agaisnt black people, there are vast resources and privileges available to them, via the system, that are not available to whites. The SYSTEM gives advantages to blacks, it is INDIVIDUALS who are racist.</comment>

<comment>No kidding. There are a tremendous number of under-qualified black students who were admitted to the major University I work at based on their race.Black privilege is going to college on diversity scholarships with lower scores than your white and asian peers.</comment>

<comment>We agree, but it will be bitter blowback indeed.</comment>

<comment>Yep, and the problem is that blowback doesn't pick sides. It harms everyone.</comment>

<comment>In America we are many voices, and we have the freedom to express those voices.What I find happening is that due to flame-fanning in traditional and social media, people have begun conflating those diverse, individual voices into one, as you do here with the term "progressives".I am culturally progressive, but I don't think safe spaces and the term cultural appropriation are useful or productive.  I do however believe that white privilege is a real thing.  I do not believe that all white people are guilty of any sin.  I do think that people see the world through their own eyes and as a white person it's easy to believe we are in a post racial society, which we clearly are not.There are a lot of decent people who casually say offensive things and I think that there is no harm in people pointing that out. For people of color this constant marginalization is a real issue.  It may seem like crying wolf to you, but it is psychologically wearing and they're expressing that, just as you are expressing your frustration with the overuse of political correctness here.To put it another way, if someone told you to just shut up because they find your thoughts annoying, would you?  should you?</comment>

<comment>Excellent. You expressed exactly what I feel but was struggling to articulate.</comment>

<comment>Completely agree with this comment. The hostility to free speech on campus is particularly dangerous. I believe that civil liberties (and religious freedom for all) and protecting the first amendment is extremely important. I think it's so important that even if I have to be a little less safe regarding terrorism (to protect those liberties) it's worth it.</comment>

<comment>College campuses are the hotbeds of extremism always. They've gone way overboard with this PC thing now when a generation ago it was almost the opposite with almost anarchy. It will swing back eventually. The best way to get your average adolescent to change their behaviour in some cases to appear to approve of it when you really don't.</comment>

<comment>Whites benefit from majority privilegeIt's just not the evil thing leftists think it is</comment>

<comment>Depends on where you live, I guess. If you're in someplace like Atlanta, it's not as much of an advantage as it is in white cities like San Francisco, Portland, or Seattle.</comment>

<comment>yes good. Ethnic Chinese (Han) people benefit from majority privilege in China. Should they cede that? No, it's the point of the nation and crucial to the success of the nation.</comment>

<comment>I think this is exactly correct.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is stopping you from being racists just don't expect people to tolerate your ilk. </comment>

<comment>Your mama's ilk.</comment>

<comment>Oh, sick burn. </comment>

<comment>I have no idea how anyone could think Trump is the right man for the job.  Yesterday he threatened a financial supporter of rivals on Twitter.  No one cared.Here are a few tidbits: http://www.al.com/opinion/inde...I guess this is where popular culture has taken us.  This will ruin the Republican party, give us HRC who has many Trumpian instincts and who will continue to ruin the nation.Cruz and Rubio should draw straws today and the loser drop out.</comment>

<comment>I'm voting for Trump because he said he'd prosecute Hillary Clinton, deport 30 million Mexicans and S. Americans and make America hate their enemies again. It's all good.</comment>

<comment>I don't know - you take, for example, those people in West Virginia that Crook references - they've seen their main source of livelihood - coal - pretty much destroyed by the government, which for all intents did it without passing a law via democratic norms, but did so with the heavy undemocratic hand of the administrative state. What are they going to do? Get jobs in factories that were shipped overseas over a decade ago? So, they're committing suicide at record rates. In another age, they'd be advancing on the capital with pitchforks and torches, ready to tar and feather the politicians that did this to them, and burn it all down. Maybe Trump offers them a valve to express their despair. Maybe it's better than the alternative. I don't know.</comment>

<comment>Political Correctness in 2015 means that any time white people stand up for their interests, they are White Supremacists, ipso facto.</comment>

<comment>Politicians have convinced the electorate that racial equality is a zero sum proposition when it certainly doesn't have to be.</comment>

<comment>"you take, for example, those people in West Virginia that Crook references - they've seen their main source of livelihood - coal - pretty much destroyed by the government, free market"Coal cannot compete with fracking. Cheap gas or coal mining-pick one</comment>

<comment>Sure it can.  You literally just dig it out of the ground and burn it, LOL.  The reason that coal is expensive is because of the government's belief that coal is too dirty and environmentally damaging, and so the regulations make it expensive.  That's the government, not any kind of a free market at work.</comment>

<comment>Coal mining has to be curtailed not only is it the dirtiest fuel around it has been killing and reducing the quality of life for the miners for its entire existence. Government should have stepped in with some plan for retraining and/or providing some alternative occupation. Solar panel manufacture might have been an option.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps all of us should strive to be more irreverent and sacrilegious in our speech.</comment>

<comment>British journalist Alistair Cooke wrote in April 1990: "...Donald Trump, the young, bouncy, blond tycoon whose aspirations to take over hotels, casinos, airlines, resorts, cities - why not the country? - appear to be boundless." Quatation from Letter from America by Alistair Cooke (London, The Folio Society, 2009). Worth reading!</comment>

<comment>So?  Why is it OK for the wife of a former president to take over the country?  Why is it OK for a communist to take over the country?</comment>

<comment>When the US people elect their president it is through a democratic process. I still try to believe that to be true. If it is Trump, Clinton or a communist that is what they want. And it would be OK in principle. Too bad we cannot ask Cooke what he meant.</comment>

<comment>Trump can actually achieve quite a bit of what he's proposing.From http://theweek.com/articles/60..."He probably couldn't deport all 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants due to simple budgetary and logistical constraints, but he could probably best the previous deportations record set by President Obama and send away about half a million per year.Trump could also make it dramatically harder for legal immigrants to enter the U.S., by ordering the Department of Homeland Security to slow-walk the visa approval process.""On trade, the president has tons of discretionary authority. If individual businesses came to him with some sort of grievance, under current law he can create endless carve-outs and special "retaliatory" duties, both personally and by pressuring the Commerce Department. The result could be a full-blown trade war with China and other nations."Anyone saying Trump won't even able to make progress on his goals is being incredibly dishonest.</comment>

<comment>We know Rubio won't even expend the effort.  Sanders and Clinton, let's be honest, see all illegal immigrants as potential Democratic voters.  They absolutely want more illegal immigrants.</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Rubio aren't even eligible to run for President.</comment>

<comment>I agree about Cruz.  I did not know about Rubio.  Wasn't he born in Florida?</comment>

<comment>That rose-colored glasses analysis fails to account for opposition.  It's likewise terribly static and predicated on some questionable assumptions.  After all, those are the types of things Obama's supporters were saying he could easily do with his legal authority - and we know how smoothly that's going.</comment>

<comment>That article was written by liberals. I know better than to post proTrump articles from proTrump sites. </comment>

<comment>So what?  My criticism is based on what was written,  not who wrote it.</comment>

<comment>Trump exploits all the ways the different elements of the Republican Party have tacitly agreed to support one another in the pursuit and maintenance of power over the last couple of generations. What he points out is you can, for example, be an evangelical Christian against abortion and gay marriage, but for social security, Medicare and higher taxes on the rich. What Trump pitches is with him, you don't need the "Grand Bargain" to give you voice and agency. That clearly is a message with depth and resonance to significant numbers across a remarkably broad demographic range.And as CF points out, as my very liberal father also noted a while ago to me, Trump is not actually saying anything fundamentally out of line from anything the other remaining candidates are also saying. Yeah, his style is a lot more crass, but it is forthright and upfront in its crassness, and in comparison, the professional "politicians" are held in sharp relief.I personally shudder at the thought of a President Trump. But in substance, Cruz and Rubio are worse. Who knows where the carnival barker ends and the real man begins with Trump, but all evidence points to his moderate instincts. Cruz and Rubio are genuine ideologues who scare me far more.</comment>

<comment>"What he points out is you can, for example, be an evangelical Christian against abortion and gay marriage, but for social security, Medicare and higher taxes on the rich. "This is exactly why the far right hates Trump.  They also hate him because he is willing to adopt a moderate position on Israel.</comment>

<comment>Why did Netanyahu stop Trump from visiting Israel?</comment>

<comment>He didn't like the condescension Trump used when he addressed a room full of Jewish businessmen. By all accounts they didn't much care for it either. He covered every insulting stereotype in the book.</comment>

<comment>Conor errs when he implicitly conflates banning Muslims from entering the country with violating Muslim-Americans' rights.  No one has a right to immigrate to the U.S.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps he's talking about restrictions on Mosques? That would seem to qualify as trampling on rights.</comment>

<comment>But I don't think Conor mentioned that, did he?  He mentioned the immigration ban and then later talked about violating Muslim American rights.  This is something people need to know: immigrating here is not a right  We could ban whites, blacks, Jews, Muslims, left-handers, whatever we want.  (In fact we've already discriminated on the basis of religion, giving preference to Jews immigrating from the USSR.)</comment>

<comment>And this is exactly the problem.  Conor argues that there are certain foundational social norms that should be off limits.  Who defines those?  Why is it self-evident that muslims should have a right to come here?  More fundamentally, why is it self-evident that we have a moral duty to accept immigrants at all?  Everything should be on the table.</comment>

<comment>He's latching on to the 40% of the GOP who thinks the 1st Amendment doesn't apply to Islam</comment>

<comment>The First Amendment does not apply to immigration.  Non-resident foreigners do not have constitutional rights.</comment>

<comment>Religious discrimination is forbidden, however.  Even against people who aren't citizens.</comment>

<comment>Only if they are in the country. We can let in whoever we want by whatever policy we want for whatever reason. We could have zero immigration.</comment>

<comment>We should have zero immigration.FTFY</comment>

<comment>No, it isn't.  Non-resident foreigners don't have constitutional rights.  In fact we've already discriminated on the basis of religion in the past, in favor of Jews coming from the USSR (discriminating against gentiles, in other words).  We can let in or refuse admission to anyone.  Coming here is not a right.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution applies to anyone subject to the jurisdiction the laws of the United States, even if they're not citizens.  It also applies to every law enacted by Congress, regardless of the specific content.</comment>

<comment>Non-resident foreigners are not subject to our jurisdiction.I'll grant the question might be open; there's plenty of precedent for such a ban, but modern courts might jump the other way."The plenary power doctrine, explains UCLA law professor Eugene Volokh, 'basically says all bets are off, constitutionally speaking, when it comes to admission of aliens to the United States, [and] historically we have discriminated based on race, national origin and speech.'That historical deference to the political branches, says Volokh, a First Amendment expert, suggests “from a constitutional perspective, it may well be that Muslims could be excluded, just like people could be excluded based on their speech and political opinions, and historically their race.'He cautions 'those cases are pretty old, so it’s not clear what the Supreme Court today would authorize.' Applying a travel ban to returning U.S. citizens who are Muslims would clearly be unconstitutional, he says, and Trump’s idea likely would require an act of Congress."http://www.usnews.com/news/art...</comment>

<comment>Idiot.To not be "subject to jurisdiction" means "laws don't apply", which would mean that a visiting national could not be prosecuted for breaking the law, any law.  Which would mean that someone with tourist visa could stand at Times Square with a gun, shoot random passers-by, and the only legal recourse would be to ban that person from re-entering America.</comment>

<comment>haha, personal attack, you lose.What part of 'non-resident' did you not understand?</comment>

<comment>Just being politically incorrect, you moron.The problem isn't about residency, it's that you don't understand, perhaps even refuse to understand, the meaning of the word "jurisdiction".But hey, believe that you want.  Educating stupid people isn't my job.</comment>

<comment>Let me get this straight: you believe that Afghani hillmen and Sudanese tribesmen are under the jurisdiction of U.S. laws and have rights under our constitution?  What all rights do they have--the right to a court-appointed lawyer under the Sixth Amendment?  The right to vote in our elections?  I don't recall our soldiers getting search warrants and otherwise giving due process of law when they kicked down doors to search for weapons in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Guess there will be a lot of civil-rights lawsuits emerging from those wars.Please, do explain how every person on earth is subject to U.S. law.  Female circumcision is illegal under our laws; when are we going to start making mass arrests in Africa and the Middle East?</comment>

<comment>If they're applying for a visa or a green card, such actions are under the jurisdiction of the United States, you dullard.If United States law doesn't determine who's allowed to enter the United States, which country's law does?Come on, shortbus.  Think this stuff through.</comment>

<comment>That the immigration process is subject to U.S. law does not mean that people going through that process have constitutional rights.  In fact our law says they do not.  Our immigration laws have discriminated against gays, people with AIDS, socialists, we had racial quotas through 1952 (they were repealed, not struck down).  Carter banned Iranian immigration and deported thousands of Iranian students.  We had a special privilege for Soviet Jews.But keep calling me dumb.  It's really working for you!</comment>

<comment>Yeah.  You're a complete moron who has no idea what he's talking about.  I shouldn't let it bother me, as you are obviously beyond hope, but someone else might read this, I don't want for your stupidity to spread to others.Everyone under the jurisdiction of US law has the same rights as anyone else.  A foreign national accused of a crime has the same rights against self-incrimination and illegal searches as any citizen.  But that's really not relevant here.  This isn't about individual rights.  It's about the constraints the constitution places on the federal government.  One of the constraints the constitution places on the government regards religious discrimination."Gays, people with AIDS, and socialists" are not a religion.  They don't have first amendment protection against discrimination.  Carter deported Iranians not because of their religion, but because of their country of origin.  Racial discrimination doesn't set a precedent for religious discrimination.  There simply is no precedent for banning an entire religion from American soil, and given the current interpretations of the 1st and 14th amendments, such a policy is extremely unlikely to pass constitutional muster.So do yourself a favor and stop being stupid.  Pointing out how wrong you are... well I wouldn't call it hard work, but it is getting tedious.</comment>

<comment>“If you take seriously the cases that have been decided in the past, they would find it constitutional,” he said of a Trump-like ban on Muslims. Though past restrictions have been based on race, nationality or political beliefs — not religion — [University of Chicago Law professor Eric] Posner said he did not see that distinction as crucial.  “As a matter of law, I don't see why it should matter,” he said. “If someone can be excluded from this country merely for having the wrong political beliefs, he could be excluded for having the wrong religious beliefs.”http://www.latimes.com/nation/...Ting, a professor at Temple University’s School of Law and a former Immigration and Naturalization Services commissioner for the Department of Justice, explained to The Daily Caller that Trump’s plan is in keeping with over a hundred years of legal precedent.“No kind of immigration restriction is unconstitutional,” Ting told TheDC. “The U.S. government can exclude a foreign national on any basis.”http://dailycaller.com/2015/12... "the Chinese Exclusion case has never been overturned. More recent decisions have upheld discrimination against immigrants based on gender and illegitimacy that would never have survived equal protection scrutiny in the domestic context. Likewise, courts have rejected the assertion of First Amendment free speech protections by noncitizens.Nor has the Supreme Court ever struck down an immigration classification, even ones based on race. As late as 1965, a federal appeals court uphelda measure that counted a Brazilian citizen of Japanese descent as Asian for the purposes of immigration quotas."http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12...Man, you sure are smart.  You know stuff that a bunch of law professors and immigration experts don't know!</comment>
