<comment>That's just plain rude. You don't have to agree with Scalia but he was a strict believer in the original intent of the Constitution. He wasn't as objective as he thought he was, he couldn't recognize his own conflicts of interest or when he was blinded by his religious views, but he was sincere.  When you tell people to go to hell, you are worse than Scalia.</comment>

<comment>The original intent like Bush v Gore? Stop the vote count because Bush might lose?</comment>

<comment>THE NEW YORK TIMES investigated the issue and said Bush won fair and square.  The NYT not FOX.  Got it stupid.  Now apologize.</comment>

<comment>A person telling someone to go to hell who seemed to go out of his way to actually make peoples lives on earth proverbial hell is not the worse person.  He may not be the first person who I wanted to die unexpectedly, but he was on the short list.</comment>

<comment>I guess a nation of laws with a Constitution is not your thing.  Try Cuba.</comment>

<comment>Scalia was all over the place on "law", mostly based on his fee-fee's</comment>

<comment>Don't have much respect for a Constitution that stated, "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness." while at the same time 500,000 blacks were held in slavery!  The Constitution was written by men. Men that owned slaves, men that had sex with those slaves and produced black babies by their slaves!  The Constitution was not written by honorable men.  Not impressed with a Congress that allowed the south to deem blacks as 3/5ths or a person,  Not impressed with a Constitution that allowed segregated schools, water fountains, bathrooms, train stations, buses.  The constitution is not the infallible word of God.   It was laws set for a certain period in time and needs many, many changes and upgrades!</comment>

<comment>Your comment is spot on. The ghostly demagoguery of the very imperfect dead white males who founded this country hangs over this country like a bad religion. Black lives have always mattered, and it's time we stopped treating the matter as an all-but-resolved resolution of an incidental oversight in American history. It's my opinion that until America actually comes fully to terms with this that the moral compromise required to dismiss it will affect every aspect of our politics. The worm in the rose, can't get anything right until that gets right. As a white woman what I see is denial, denial, denial. I for one don't see why I shouldn't carry the burden of my ancestors misdeeds, because I was born into the privilege that those misdeeds sustained. That's why restitution, which sounds crazy and radical to most whites, is the only correct response. Saying sorry doesn't cut it. And the 50,000 brands of denial are shameful, and damage us all.</comment>

<comment>I hold this truth to be self evident, you don't know anything about the Constitution and are so stupid you should not be allowed to vote.  The quote is from the Declaration of Independence and has nothing to do with the Constitution.   White taxpayers spent about $40,000 to put you through high school.  Apparently you were asleep or taking drugs.  You are a disgrace, not only to your race, but to America.</comment>

<comment>It is so sad how you spend your whole life trolling the forums.  Must be very lonley not having any friends or anyone who cares whether you live or die.  You will not be remembered, no one will morn you when you die, you will leave no important legacy!</comment>

<comment>A moron and nasty. Typical.  Why don't you go blame some white people for your shortcomings, while I take my children to a Klan meeting.  Stupid POS.</comment>

<comment>LOL!  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!</comment>

<comment>It's obvious that it's $39,990 more than was was spent on your education.  Although, $10 did buy you a bunch of crayons and coloring books.</comment>

<comment>Is that a picture of you showing the world your IQ?</comment>

<comment>"Urethra Franklin" - that's an obvious troll name.  Flag and move on.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry. The man-hating, anti-American, hook nosed Ginsberg has one half-dead, putrefying foot in the grave already. Did you see her drooling at the state of the union? </comment>

<comment>Are you sure that wasn't snot?</comment>

<comment>No worse than the discharge coming from your vagina and rectum.</comment>

<comment>Anti-semitic, very audible dog whistle, there. Creep.</comment>

<comment>Ginsberg is anti-white, and she doesn't use a dog whistle to announce her hatred for white men and Christianity.</comment>

<comment>Speaking of a putrefying foot, did the doctor have a difficult time pulling one out your momma's vagina at your birth?</comment>

<comment>Pulling out... something your dad never learned.</comment>

<comment>RIP Scalia.... you harmed your country.</comment>

<comment>This is why America deserves to die.  America deserves to become a Turd World cesspool.  Every city in America deserves to become another Fergudishu.</comment>

<comment>This is why your parents too deserve to die. America has become a Turd cesspool with the likes of you.  Hopefully, you're the end of your gene pool.</comment>

<comment>re Scalia -- the last time there was a vacancy in an election year due to a death was in 1916...and the justice was replaced that year.since 1900, there have been only three additional vacancies (caused by resignation) during an election year (Holmes, Hughes, Minton) -- and all three were replaced the same year.</comment>

<comment>Right now, I'm  leaning toward voting for a Republican, but if they stonewall a SCOTUS confirmation, that will leave a bad taste in my mouth and make me more inclined to cast my ballot for Hillary.</comment>

<comment>It will be off putting to a lot of people. it's imperative Obama nominates and let them obstruct.</comment>

<comment>It would be a rallying cry for the Dems.Dems have more voters but its harder to get them to the polls.</comment>

<comment>That only happens if he nominates a Democrat, and not a de facto Republican. He tends to capitulate so that worries me.I wish he would nominate Elizabeth Warren!</comment>

<comment>Warren's already 66...</comment>

<comment>So? That's not too old.</comment>

<comment>Not to do the job, but it is to be there for 40 years or so. Which is why people are talking up Sri Srinavasan, now 48. He'd give the Dems a seat on the SC for nearly two decades longer. I love Elizabeth Warren, I'd prefer her as President over any of the current candidates of either party, but she wouldn't be around long enough for SCOTUS.Scalia was 50, give or take six months, when he got onto the SC, and served 30 years. Imagine how different our world would be if he had been 66 when he got on, and still died at 79, to be replaced by a Bill Clinton nominee. Not around for Heller, nor Citizens United, nor Hobby Lobby. And, most of all, not around to stop the recount in Bush v Gore.I'd prefer the current proposal for an 18 year term limit, both to remove the current incentive to pick too-young people rather than the best people and to keep people who are no longer intellectually able to do the job from hanging on into their dotage. But until that becomes part of the Constitution, we have to play by the rules currently in place. </comment>

<comment>You don't really lean Republican. You are a Hillary Democrat who thinks mistakenly that if enough Democrats fake being on the fence - that you can influence the Republicans to roll over and take it up the rear end.</comment>

<comment>I am a registered Independent who has never, to the best of my recollection, voted a straight ticket. I voted for Gary Johnson for POTUS in 2012. I don't like Hillary and Sanders frankly scares the heck out of me. I have too much money invested in the stock market to want a political revolution, sorry!I've been considering Donald Trump, to the point where I was contemplating switching my affiliation to Republican in order to vote for him in the primary, but now I'm hesitating. He really disappointed me last night. It is the President's duty to make an appointment and the Senate's duty to evaluate the candidate impartially based on his or her merits. To pledge to delay (or, in the case of Cruz, filibuster) ANY candidate (before one has even been identified) is malfeasance, IMO. The SCOTUS should not be without a justice for a year due to political shenanigans! So I'm waiting to see if the Party of No can muster the integrity to do the right thing before I commit.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but it is already February, and Obama is a commie Muslim.  So, per common sense, that POS isn't going to pick the next judge.  He already picked two left wing idiots.</comment>

<comment>Haha! "Obama is a commie Muslim". You're like a caricature of a real person.</comment>

<comment>You look just like your mother.  Is she dead too?</comment>

<comment>Got me, good comeback.</comment>

<comment>I may not have agreed with every word that Justice Scalia said, but he certainly did - and that's a rare virtue nowadays! He never pandered, obfuscated, or dissimulated. He spoke his mind, and acted on it.Rest in peace, Justice Scalia. You served with honor and class, and the country already misses you.</comment>

<comment>What kind of debate rules are these? When a candidate attacks another candidates brother, that candidate gets to respond.</comment>

<comment>South Carolina rules.It's a goober state. Those people can barely read.</comment>

<comment>If it were real South Carolina rules, they would have a duel on stage.</comment>

<comment>They can "barely read"?I didn't know SC was filled with blacks and Hispanics instead of Whites.  Of course, when you point out that Whites are far more literate than blacks and Hispanics across every academic spectrum then the anti-White hatred of the so-called "tolerant" and "open-minded" Liberal is revealed.You don't care about literacy.  You just hate White people.You don't care about education.  You just hate White people.You don't care about policies.  You just hate White people.You don't care about safety.  You just hate White people.You don't care about religion.  You just hate White people.Flooding America with the Turd World is your way of destroying White people.  That's your revenge on "evil" Whites.  If Whites become a hated, beleaguered minority then that's magically "good."This is precisely why America needs to die.  The sooner the better.</comment>

<comment>In the post, Sacha Zimmerman says: 'Dickerson is on fire! He shuts down the Jeb-Trump squabbling by saying, “I’m going to ask Ted Cruz a question now—who is also running for president."'Oh, yeah, that question "what prepares a surgeon to answer the 2am call?" is great.Fry cooks at McDonald's get asked tougher questions than anyone at a debate has been asked. Demand better.</comment>

<comment>The audience doesn't want it.</comment>

<comment>Trump is an idiot. SC loves the military. And they loved sending thousands of Americans to their deaths, in a war of choice. They loved the war bill, and the long term healthcare of hundreds of thousands that served. I agree with what he said, but it just shows what an idiot he is.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.... SC is full of idiots.</comment>

<comment>The more radical his statements are, the more it convinces people he is speaking his mind.  Just like Sanders.  Authenticity seems to be the main driver this year.  Not previously seen in politics.  People are chewing it over and liking the taste.Maybe hating 40% of what someone stands for is better than liking 100% of what they say, but not having any idea what kind of deals they make behind closes doors.</comment>

<comment>Trump already said McCain was a failure for being taken prisoner, and he is ahead in the polls.He has already said Iraq was a blunder and Bush should have been impeached.Trump wants to see if his vote sticks if he tortures a Bush and threatens his family on stage. </comment>

<comment>"Trump's vociferous opposition to the war in Iraq is an underrated element of his appeal."Molly do some research and try to find a single statement by Trump in opposition to the War in Iraq prior to 14 months AFTER we went inTrump is still being allowed to continue the same lie over and over again.Trump does not belong on that stage - still showing his irgn0rance</comment>

<comment>He predicted the Broncos would win the Super Bowl, yesterday.</comment>

<comment>What about his bizarre conspiracy nonsense that Bush's people told him to not voice his opinions about the war.</comment>

<comment>There are a lot of Republicans who STILL refuse to admit it was a huge blunder.  Seeing that 14 months in does not make him a savant, but it puts him head and shoulders above the rest of that pack.</comment>

<comment>Any lost war is a huge blunder. But Bush stabilized Iraq and left a victory to Obama. It was a partial victory, a costly victory, but a victory nonetheless.Obama threw that victory away, deliberately. Obama hates American military power and wanted Bush to lose the war so much he didn't care if he lost the war; his base would always let him blame Bush for everything. So he skedaddled, and did nothing as the situation went from bad to worse, a process which took years.</comment>

<comment>utter bllsh!t</comment>

<comment>Obama withdrew our troops because that is what the majority of Americans wanted.  And the majority of Americans were right.  Money does not grow on trees.  That decision cost over 2 Trillion dollars and may grow to 6 Trillion over coming decades.  We have 2 million veterans to take care of, many physically or psychologically disabled. Our actions led to the death of at least half a million Iraqi's and displaced millions more, which has made them skeptical of our ability to provide further "help."  ISIS is nothing more than the next iteration of the insurgency that we have already beat down several times, only to see it spring back up as soon we let up the military pressure.  It's a mess over there, but there is nothing to justify our doubling down on the Bush blunder.</comment>

<comment>I fncking hate T-rump, but 14 months after we invaded I still supported it, and that was about the time I was prepping to go to it.</comment>

<comment>It is all but impossible not to get on the bandwagon once we are at war.  Then, once you have got on the bandwagon, it is all but impossible to admit you were wrong.  So, we double down and never learn.  That is why you really need to respect someone like Sanders who opposed the war, who knows, to paraphrase Rumsfeld, that their are "known unknowns."</comment>

<comment>Did Rubio bring a squad of high school cheerleaders?</comment>

<comment>The Republican Establishment in the crowd think that GWB was a great president.  They are completely out of touch with their own base.  They are morons for booing the front runner while cheering on a candidate polling at 5%.</comment>

<comment>GWB was responsible for the deaths of many of their children, family members and friends. It is a hard thing to admit that a loved one died for some misguided neocon ideology – so they go the other way and bury themselves in denial."USA! USA!"</comment>

<comment>They are all in denial. I don't remember who said in Fox the other day that he/she met someone who worked in the New Hampshire GOP and didn't think Trump would win, saying he "spent all his time around republican voters" and he "didn't hear it, didn't see it, didn't feel it". Seems like those republican voters were just donors and elites. They're in a bubble. Don't worry, though, it's gonna burst soon. Hopefully it's not too late.</comment>

<comment>If GWB is still really liked anywhere, it is in Texas and South Carolina. It was not a mistake for Trump to point out his mistakes. But imo it was a big mistake for Trump to attack GWB using the lies of the Left.</comment>

<comment>RIP The  Honorable  Scalia.  Thank you for your service and sympathies to the family.</comment>

<comment>RIP.... but the was nothing "honorable" about him.</comment>

<comment>Scalia used to say that although the Constitution forbids "cruel and unusual punishment", interrogation is not punishment - therefore, waterboarding and any other torture of the innocent is perfectly OK.  So while he's in purgatory, at least, I don't think he deserves to rest in peace.</comment>

<comment>You guys are hiding behind a Maginot line, fighting the last war. The country is up in arms.

<comment>No idea what you're talking about. I am and have been fully Sanders since the beginning of the election season.</comment>

<comment>"Donald Trump’s assertion that he would build consensus through Congress, and is uncomfortable with executive orders, is one of several ways that he departs from the archetype of the classic demagogue."I don't remember Trump ever being part of a team, or willing to compromise (which is a basic requirement for achieving a consensus among opposing interests). Unless his idea of teamwork is "everybody doing what I say," that is.He'll only depart from the archetype of the classic demagogue until the election is over. If he wins, he'll be the U.S. Demagogue-in-Chief. If not, he'll go back to being the private-sector equivalent.After all, if he ain't broke, why fix anything?</comment>

<comment>Cruz erupted in Spanish when Rubio dinged him for not speaking Spanish.  That was hilarious!  It was like Ricky Ricardo losing it when Lucy pressed his buttons.Having two Cubans argue in Spanish during a Republican debate is not gonna help either of them.  I mean, if Rubio accused Cruz of being gay- would Cruz want to show his pink thong on stage?Also, the highlight was when Trump said that Bush dropped his pants and mooned the audience.At this point, Bush comes off less likable than Martin Shkrelli.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump may want to rethink the "Mexican wall" idea.

<comment>To the "SC is full of idiots (aka voters)" comment: Trump wins their GOP primary.</comment>

<comment>Trump's comments on the Iraq War ARE conservative!!! It's the Republican Party that has become a neocon infested pile of garbage in recent years! How can a conservative say that it was alright to waste BILLIONS of dollars and HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of American lives in a war that not only did it NOT make us safe, it made us LESS safe, creating the instability that gave rise to ISIS and left a power vacuum to be (possibly) filled by Iran! And the 9/11 comment, let me tell y'all something: it must be really easy to talk about 9/11 when you were in Florida and had no friends or even acquaintances die there, but Trump was there when the towers fell, and as he mentioned (and was VISIBLY angry when Jeb! started defending his brother like the unthinking establishment robot he is) he lost HUNDREDS of friends that day. Forgive someone who actually WENT THROUGH the pains of 9/11 for not believing W kept us safe. That doesn't make him a leftist. It makes him a CONSERVATIVE (at least on that point) and shows the pile of garbage our "Grand Ole Party" has become.</comment>

<comment>"How can a conservative say..."A conservative wouldn't say that.Thats a "republican".And a false one no less.</comment>

<comment>Oh I know. Conservative and republican are supposed to be synonyms, but sadly, that's far from the truth these days. But yeah, there's one reason I don't call myself a Republican anymore, just a conservative. Just wait till the RNC screws Trump or Cruz over in the convention and picks an establishment candidate...I'm voting third party. Maybe even permanently.</comment>

<comment>I don't think the RNC would be strong enough to do that, even if no candidate amassed 1237 delegates before the convention.</comment>

<comment>Oh I wouldn't put it past them.</comment>

<comment>Oy vey! Don't say that! The Neo-Cohen perpetrators of the Iraq war will call you an anti-Semite!!!</comment>

<comment>Well they can call me whatever the hell they want. I support Israel, but the Iraq War was beneficial to NO ONE. Maybe democrats who capitalized on Bush's unpopularity and kept our spiralling decline going even faster for eight years. Actually it seems like it was beneficial to American Jews at least lol.</comment>

<comment>The Iraq war was beneficial to ISRAEL. The Neo-con advisers who influenced the gullible bible-toting W were all hardcore pro-Israel Neo-cons.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. The Iraq war made Iran stronger, which is an existential danger to Israel, far worse than Saddam ever was. Then Obama gave Iran $150 billion and his blessing on their nuclear program, throwing all former US Mideast allies under the bus.</comment>

<comment>Embarrassing </comment>

<comment>Yeah, but even the israelis advised him against getting inside Iraq, saying it would destabilize the region (which it did). Maybe we shoulda listened to THEM.</comment>

<comment>It's always good to play both sides of the coin. Jews are famous for that!</comment>

<comment>No need to call you anything, you are demonstrating it all by yourself.</comment>

<comment>The Iraq war gave rise to ISIS because Obama skedaddled too soon from the relatively stable Iraq Bush left him.</comment>

<comment>SOFA, idiot</comment>

<comment>SOFA, which Obama only pretended to try to negotiate, as he planned to skedaddle. That's not a Republican opinion btw, that's the opinion of Leon Panetta, Obama's own SecDef at the time.Such a passive aggressive approach is pure Obama. Whine, scold and sneak, those are Obama methods.</comment>

<comment>Keep defending the Bush disaster, it's embarrassing. Now tell us about how awesome bush's bank bailout was. </comment>

<comment>The Iraqi government wanted US troops to leave. Obama didn't have a choice other than to withdraw the troops.The Iraq war gave rise to IS because a dumb-ass republican president thought it'd be a good idea to invade Iraq.</comment>

<comment>so obama takes orders from iraqi crackpots ?</comment>

<comment>Obama was following a plan that your boy Bush agreed to. But you are right: No one should follow a plan that Bush agreed to.</comment>

<comment>Obama respects the wishes of the democratically elected Iraqi government. The same government which the Bush administration spent so much American lives and treasure setting up.</comment>

<comment>Note I'm not defending Obama's Middle Eastern policies, as they were just as destructive (if not more) as Bush's, but you couldn't just expect American soldiers to stay in Iraq forever. Why engage in nation building? What do we get out of it? And no: Iraq wasn't stable if it required our Army to be stationed there to keep it from total anarchy. It's the same crap that happened in Libya later. We go in, toppling stable governments in the name of democracy, destabilize it, and BOOM, a bunch of Muslim refugees flooding Europe and (if we let Obama get his way) America. We need to be more careful in our foreign policy decisions, especially regarding war.</comment>

<comment>"The Republican frontrunner repudiated a long litany of party orthodoxies..."The GOP that has allowed the libs to get away with anything in exchange for a war profit?Boehner style!That fox news, washington DC and the GOP establishment HATE HIM,is the Trumps primary job qualification.</comment>

<comment>Because he says things Democrats have been saying for a decade about the Iraq War?Oh the irnoy</comment>

<comment>I dont know much about irnoy.But I haven't heard him war mongering about the middle east.Thats why they hate him.He hasn't signed up to strangle a baby just in case it might be Hitler.He seems mostly upset about the immigration issue,and so am I.And thats our only connection to the middle east.</comment>

<comment>Well he wants to commit war crimes against civilians</comment>

<comment>Don't know much about irnoyDon't know much biologyDon't know much about a science bookDon't know much about the French I tookBut I do know that I'll water-board youAnd you know that I'll do far worse, tooWhat a Trumperful world this could be</comment>

<comment>When Bush was president, and the top item on his daily briefing said that Osama bin Laden was poised to attack, instead of acting on it and assembling the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he literally ignored the single most important item on his daily briefing. When it came out in the news, they made the excuse that "the President gets a lot of memos" as if the top item in his daily briefing is just another piece of paper that came across his desk. This isn't some wild assertion from Trump. It's documented fact.When the Bush administration put up "evidence" of WMDs, every reputable scientist dismissed it as full of errors, and showed how it was impossible for it to be WMDs. For example, the milk factory's tubes were simply the wrong type, but the right type to process milk. The extreme right is very good at dismissing science and they do it time and time again. But just about the entire world agreed that there was no evidence of WMDs. It wasn't a partisan issue. It was a scientific one. Now that we all know that the scientists were right, and it's not only that the WMDs didn't exist but what was found on the ground based on the evidence presented had nothing to to with WMDs, we have people like Jeb saying that he wouldn't send us into Iraq if we knew then what we know now. Guess what? We did know then what we know now.First they ignore the scientists about smoking. Eventually they look like fools. Then they ignore the scientists about WMDs. The whole world knew they were wrong. They end up looking like fools. The rest of the world recognizes that climate change is a fact, and the political disagreement in the rest of the world is over what to do about it or who should pay for it, rather than denying it even exists, but the Republicans again want to ignore science.No wonder Trump wants to be a more honest Republican than the liars and cheaters who came before him on these issues. Americans say they feel betrayed by the Republican party, and that leaves Trump.</comment>

<comment>Those same morons have been calling Democrats traitors for saying the same exact stuff for a good decade</comment>

<comment>No, the Dems were just liars for saying that stuff. The traitor part came in when they worked so hard to make us lose in Iraq. They didn't manage when Bush was in office, much to their frustration, but they sure fixed that under Obama!</comment>

<comment>Further evidence of self-delusion. Take off your partisan blinders and look at some facts.</comment>

<comment>Some people decide what they believe first, then pick and choose things to support their side. With Trump, it's less clear that he's doing that. With Democrats, it wasn't political. It was about security. The same ones who were against the Iraq war because of lack of evidence were largely in favor of going into Afghanistan, so it never came down to Bush being the leader. But for many Republicans, it did come down to Bush being the leader. Now many Republicans feel betrayed by their own party, especially those in Congress.  But they need to recognize that Bush was also a big part of the problem. It's not a matter of where you stand on economic issues or foreign policy. You can share a candidate's views on anything from abortion to healthcare, but it doesn't mean that he's the right person for the Presidency or any office for that matter.</comment>

<comment>Untold Story of the Iraq War ~ Commandos, Dirty Wars and Col. James Steelehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Another dupe of Dem propaganda self-identifies.Trump made a big mistake imo repeating these Democratic attacks on GW Bush in South Carolina, a heavily military state where GW Bush is much respected.Bush acted on the evidence the CIA gave him, which was corroborated by the opinions of the British, French and German foreign intelligence agencies (even though France and Germany opposed the war). That was the whole point of stressing WMDs in the first place -- everybody agreed on them. But the CIA evidence turned out to be wrong, which was the real reason the CIA turned on Bush -- the CIA needed Bush to take the fall for their bad intelligence, lest they take the fall for it. This has been well chronicled by Bob Woodward & others -- "slam dunk case" Tenet called it etc.The Dems meanwhile needed to do a 180 on their former support for the Iraq War, which was why they cooked up the false "Bush lied!" attack in June 2004. It was a shameful attack on a decent man, but the Dems have become a party without shame. The GOP base despises Dem leadership and will not appreciate Trump following their lead.</comment>

<comment>Bush and Cheney either lied or were inexplicably passive. Either way, they screwed up and many people died.Opportunistic Democrats going along with them does not excuse or rationalize what Bush and Cheney did.Nice try rewriting history, or ginning up an excuse for the cons who duped you, but the fact is Bush and Cheney screwed up big-time.</comment>

<comment>After looking at the highlights, I see Trump won, according to all polls Googled......Again.Being comfortable in your own skin works wonders. Having a counter attack works well also.No deer in the headlight look, no sweating profusely, no rambling, and no blatant lies. And he's less experienced at Debate of anybody running. Trump's upside is out the roof!</comment>

<comment>At Debate maybe, but certainly not at being on TV. You can't call these debates anyway.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't say the Trump is necessarily the best candidate the GOP has.But he's easily a better alternative to hillary/bernie.Unless you're a free-stuff slumlord with a profit to gain</comment>

<comment>Cruz is the best candidate. Trump is the only other good candidate. Everyone else can go suck my ****. They're useless neocons, with this debate being IRREFUTABLE proof that they would make the SAME mistakes G.W.B. made. Unbelievable. "The definition of insanity is trying the same thing multiple times expecting different results".</comment>

<comment>"Cruz’s words may have simply been a jab at Rubio for accusing him of not speaking Spanish, but it also marks a shift in discourse on Latinos, as the party up to now has isolated many of them for its aggressive rhetoric over immigration."Yes, because obviously all Latinos are the same, just a big monolith. In my experience, most Mexicanos and Centroamericanos do NOT like Cubanos.</comment>

<comment>The word "Latino" is merely a conceit invented by progressives in order to try to group people who may sometimes have very little in common, but to pretend as if they always do.</comment>

<comment>Oh, that was progressives? I never realized. Thanks so much for clearing that up for everyone.Here I just thought it was a demographic term that's been around for decades. Those sneaky progressives.</comment>

<comment>You're welcome. Glad I could educate you on that.</comment>

<comment>Caught the Publican debate Saturday in S.C.I was stricken by the impassioned closing speech of Marco Rubio, pledging supportfor Israel and the allies of the YSSAaround the world. I've heard politicianscall Israelis allies of the YSSA all my life, and for the life of me I don't know what they mean.Is it the national secrets stolen from the YSSA for Israel by Johnathan Pollard, that makes Israel such a great ally?Is it the 31 U.S. sailors, two U.S. marines and one U.S. civilian murderedby the Israelis in the Israeli assault on the USS Liberty in the Mediterranean in 1967, that makes Israel such a valued ally? Maybe it's the trillions of dollars embezzled from Uhmericuhn investors by Wall Street bankers and laundered through Israeli banks, that makes Israel such a stellar friend. I just don't get it. I suppose you have to have your hand out like a money grubbing politician to truly appreciate the Israelis as allies.On the other hand, I absolutely understandwhy the Israelis consider the YSSA such a great ally. I mean, where else in the world can Israel find such a soft touch as Bernie Sanders, Marco Rubio and the Uhmericuhnpeople?</comment>

<comment>Wall street money laundered through Israeli Banks?</comment>

<comment>If Donald Trump doesn't put 'Wood' in your pants, I doubt your American at all...</comment>

<comment>First I Trumped.Then I Trump Trumped,before I realized that I was Trumping the whole time.Denying my inner Trump.</comment>

<comment>I am beginning to love Trump.  All these years Republicans have got elected by getting people to hate Democrats rather than getting them to like Republicans, and that is finally coming home to roost.   All it takes is someone who is not a Democrat to punch them full of holes.  I wonder if this is like George Wallace in the 60's, corralling the numbskull wing of the Democratic party as a prelude to their mass migration to the Republican side.</comment>

<comment>"I am beginning to love Trump."Discovering love can be traumatic my friend.</comment>

<comment>At the very least you have considered it.</comment>

<comment>Have you looked in the mirror lately?  Or listened to the Democratic candidates?  Hate goes both ways Tim.  The vitriol from both sides is amazing.  Until we get past our hate, we're doomed.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I have listened to the Democrats.  They are reasonable and adult like.  There is no compare.   Republicans utter "Obama" or "Obamacare" as if it is a magical incantation.  Do you know what any of them would do about health care?  In case you forget, health care spending was growing at 10% annually for the 30 years prior to Obama's election, and everyone recognized this was not sustainable.  Since 2008, growth has averaged less than 5% annually, though much of this due to the massive financial collapse triggered by the out of control financial industry, rather than Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>Hopefully Trump will grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal to hunt illegals.  I didn't join the USMC to fight wars for Israel.  I'd be happy to open fire on anchor babies and their autistic Libcuck shields.</comment>

<comment>Trump promises America Mexico will pay for our sins.

<comment>It sorta depends how wiling the American populace is to embrace nationalismIn an ordered society, conservatism is a sidekick to nationalism, not the other way around.

<comment>maybe you embrace going from the biggest creditor to the biggest debtor ?that would be just for starters.</comment>

<comment>I watched a good portion of the debate an I have got to say I was pretty disgusted.  I was disgusted with the way the candidates attacked one another and I was disgusted at the smirk of the moderators faces as they enjoyed every minute of their self destruction.  Someone needs to smack the S*** out of everyone of them and then they need to smack the S*** out of the Republicans in charge of setting up the debate circus twice.   I cannot believe how F****** stupid they all acted.  This is exactly why I dumped the GOP.  I'm a conservative but I hate the morons in the GOP.  </comment>

<comment>Oh yeah, sure. You are a conservative for Hillary. Very credible.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is a felon and should drop out of the race......better yet.....be cuffed on stage and thrown in prison.How could any Conservative be proud of what they watched last night.   We need a left of center conservative to enter as a third party.</comment>

<comment>I thought it was great TV! CBS needed to drop Carson , he kept killing the momentum.</comment>

<comment>You dumped the GOP for what party?</comment>

<comment>I consider myself a little left of center fiscal conservative.  I don't want to be associated with either party because I don't want to feel obligated to defend the stupid s*** they do.</comment>

<comment>Rubio thanked God Bush let 9/11 happen, instead of Gore. WTF?</comment>

<comment>"Cruz’s words may have simply been a jab at Rubio for accusing him of not speaking Spanish, but it also marks a shift in discourse on Latinos, as the party up to now has isolated many of them for its aggressive rhetoric over immigration."I think it's fair to say that the isolation will continue. We really have crossed over into weird territory when speaking Spanish is used as credentials about how anti-immigrant one is.</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Rubio: “Now that we and our families are in the US, we need to forbid anyone else from coming in.” Après moi, le déluge, as that old French king said once: After me, let the Deluge come.</comment>

<comment>I can't fathom how almost everyone seems to bundle together everything that has to do with immigration, instead of separating issues that clearly don't belong together:1. We need to seal off our borders effectively and implement a policy that allows in classes of desireable immigrants. Obviously we can't just throw open the borders. Other countries have strict immigration rules and so should we.2. Illigals currently in the USA is a hot potato that needs to be addressed. I favor giving them a path to legal permanent residence, but not citizenship. Other approaches may work, as long as we don't try to deport them all.</comment>

<comment>I disagreed with your post above but agree with this one.  There can be common ground.</comment>

<comment>The accu-check Trump proposes would make it impossible to hire illegals. Cutting off all welfare and support networks will leave them no choice but to self-deport.</comment>

<comment>This worked to some extent in Oklahoma.  We passed laws hitting the employers and illegals scatted to surrounding states.  Until they figured out we weren't enforcing it that is.</comment>

<comment>Why is the left so happy to import poverty?</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump is arguably a liberal at heart. He may be more to the left than Hillary Clinton, if a Left existed in the US, which is not the case.</comment>

<comment>you can see the left in the supreme court - or are you blind as well as dumb</comment>

<comment>You have no idea what Left means, my friend. Clue: it is different from "Liberal" and "Democrat".</comment>

<comment>nice try birdbrainbeen dealing with the Left since 1966</comment>

<comment>Correction, Mr Igno Ramos: You have been dealing with what sorry excuse of a "movement" (more like a disparate and motley collection of weirdos) that passes for a Left, not a Left per se. I read your list of "commie infiltrators" in your other comment. I don't know much about them individually, but I do know they did not form a movement or a party that could rightly be considered a Left. They may each have had leftist leanings as individuals, that I don't know, and I am not interested enough to research, because their influence would be negligible at best.</comment>

<comment>It's too bad that Trump's proposed budget makes zero sense (except politically), because his willingness to depart from rigid ideology makes him refreshing as a candidate.I could ALMOST squint my eyes and pretend I didn't hear him call for a religious test for refugees and immigrants, simply because the US is not going to be taking very many entrants from Muslim countries regardless of whether such a test exists (hence, the harm is mostly in the precedent).But the next president does need to have a keen idea of how the budget actually works, and the fact that the deficit is going to increase even without him or her adding to the problem.  A candidate who proposes cutting taxes, increasing military spending, and doing nothing to address the growing cost of social security and medicare cannot be a serious candidate in my opinion.</comment>

<comment>How budgets works and you actually thinks the people in there right now know how it works 20 trillion dollars later, good grief pal.</comment>

<comment>The same people like the OP will squeal like stuck pigs if anyone tries to scale back any government spending.</comment>

<comment>Oh how I wish Trump didn't have such a repulsive character! If you dig below the surface it's quite clear that he's neither a Republican, nor a Democrat. He knew quite well that it's easier to get elected running as one of the established party's candidates, that staging an independent bid.I think Republicans have gotten so caught up in their anti-Obama rhetoric over the past years, that they never realized how absurd their arguments have gotten. Rendered blind and ineffective by their childish arguments, they've brought out the worst of America.Trump initially pressed the right buttons, making him seem like a "real" Republican. His true, moderate viewpoints are slowly being revealed and I think the Republican voters are finally seeing the light - realizing that their party has been in shambles all along. They like what they're seeing and are backing the best of a dark collection of Republican candidates.I wouldn't be surprised if many Democrats also support Trump's ideas, yet won't admit it publicly. Given their two choices, Trump way well be triumphant. Too bad he has such a repulsive character!</comment>

<comment>I think Democrats have gotten so caught up in their anti-Bush rhetoric over the past years, that they never realized how absurd their arguments have gotten. Rendered blind and ineffective by their childish arguments, they've brought out the worst of America.</comment>

<comment>I've yet to meet any Democrats who thought that Bush:-was born in a foreign country and smuggled into the USA with forged documents as part of a plot to get him elected President-created hurricanes to get re-elected-was responsible for acts of Congress committed in the early 1990sETA: And that's just on The Atlantic's comment boards</comment>

<comment>Uh, OK.  Not sure if you're trying to obfuscate but surely you know Democrats have their own list of grievances about Bush.My point in rewording Jake's post is that both parties have been hijacked by extremes,</comment>

<comment>The only thing the Dems really criticize Bush for are the Iraq war and the terrible recession we are trying to recover from, which most Republicans agree with. Other than that, most of the Democrats reason like normal people.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but there is a difference between internet discussions by people with views considered "left" and the stupid accusations made by sitting members of Congress and high-ranking party officials in the GOP.These people claiming to represent the GOP on a national stage are outright accusing Obama of being a secret Muslim, not a citizen, traitor, whatever.  Name one single high-ranking Democrat who did anything similar while holding national office.</comment>

<comment>Rhetoric? Who could have imagined 9/11? Democracy on the march in the Middle East? The biggest job loss of any administration in its first several years since the 1920s? The levies breaking while the entire Presidential succession, VP, Speaker of the House, Sec'y of State, President, himself went on vacation and stayed there? The economic collapse of '08, disputed by the President himself right up to the day in which the siht hit the fan? Don't know much about a science book, don't much about the math, I took; don't much about history either.  My Pet Goat, the boy who cried wolf.</comment>

<comment>Trump is popular with American workers because his views on trade are national capitalist.  The establishment Republicrats basically want to give away America's ingenuity and industry for the sake of short-term profits.  All working people I know basically despise the treason of the Republican donor class and likewise hate the Democratic party for instituting cultural Marxist rot on the land.  The American working class wants a indivisible nation returned to us, not an open-borders geographical nightmare filled with Third World malaise and incompetence.  That's why we support Trump.</comment>

<comment>When people like you say short term profits.  You fail to understand a business must make a profit to stay in business.</comment>

<comment>So I take it that you're all set in life and are okay with the de-industrialization of America.  And by the way, why do you think that retailers are Sears are going down the toilet?  Yep, take the money now and forget about long-range planning.</comment>

<comment>I'm not a financial genius, I'm an IT guy, so I don't know what the answer is, but isn't it the continual drive for quarterly dividends that results in short term thinking?</comment>

<comment>Short-term thinking involves allowing the destruction of the middle classes in America - by lop-sided trade deals conducted by political and economic elites that do not have the interests of the majority in mind - such that the US consumer market for foreign-produced goods shrinks till the country approaches Third World purchase capacity levels.  This has been in evidence for years now around the holiday seasons.   American workers need a President Trump who will be both pro-business and pro-worker - a nationalist, a populist, a patriot.</comment>

<comment>A business operates for one goal.  To stay in business.</comment>

<comment>Putting your potential customers out of work is short sighted.</comment>

<comment>Carrier must anticipate selling lots of furnaces in warm, sunny Mexico. lol</comment>

<comment>To serve Wall-street insider investment with good qtly financial reports. What about US workers? Are you saying the current global economy has driven the wage down so much with cheap overseas labor that there is nothing we can do about it to remain competitive? Do we raise the rate of cheap overseas labor as well? Then we have inflation. To eliminate Corp inversion, we need a lower Corp tax rate and lesser gvmt. regulations in the US.</comment>

<comment>You make it too expensive to be offshore</comment>

<comment>Idk just throwing out some things to think about. Everything has cause & effects. </comment>

<comment>Yes, the effect is no longer being held hostage by China</comment>

<comment>How so? What about Mexico and it's too much profit for business investors to walk away from - cheap labor, low taxes & regs.</comment>

<comment>Same thing, you make it too expensive to NOT operate here.</comment>

<comment>And they ought to stay in business in the US.  Nation first, business second.  All classes of people prosper under nationalism but die under internationalism.  Trump is a patriot first who will make sure that all deals made with foreign powers will benefit the US first and foremost.  The way trade deals are conducted now is for our traitors to simply hand over the bank to foreigners and our elite capitalists.</comment>

<comment>King Trump will force Ford, Apple, Carrier etc, to onshore operations.  Do you also believe in the tooth fairy and Santy Claus?</comment>

<comment>Maybe Trump would make the US more competitive.</comment>

<comment>He boasted how his bankruptcies were business decisions to help his companies. When Ford and the like, decide to offshore, are they not making business decisions to shore up their long term prospects?</comment>

<comment>If offshoring is needed to keep Ford in business, they will offshore.  The government needs to look at the polices that led to offshoring, and make adjustments.</comment>

<comment>You must be part of the Republican donor/treason class.  Either that or an Obama supporter who failed to notice how our flunky of a President has said nothing about Carrier's recent announcement.</comment>

<comment>The popular myth is companies leave due to wages, but that is not true. The principal motivation is the 40% corporate tax. Most of what is left over after that hit is paid to the workers, who again pay tax. This 40% is the highest in the world, 20% is customary in most countries and that was the rate in the US when we were doing well.Lowering the corporate tax rate will stop companies from moving out all together and encourage businesses to move home and new start-ups. Our current path of ever greater taxes on fewer and fewer companies and workers cannot end well. We can't all make a living serving coffee to each other.</comment>

<comment>The top rate is 35% but our tax code is full of so many write-offs and deductions that very few companies actually pay thay rate . . .the big ones pay a fraction of that.</comment>

<comment>Tim Cook quoted 40% for Apple, where did that come from? I would also note these deductions you tout are not free, carefully structured by the government, and not necessarily the best interest of the business. If your argument is the effective rate is lower, how about getting rid of the game, eliminating the deductions, and just going with the lower rate? It would save everyone a great deal of effort, uncertainty, and expense.</comment>

<comment>It's Archie Bunker's party now.</comment>

<comment>Bunch of meatheads</comment>

<comment>What is you avatar pic supposed to represent?</comment>

<comment>Today Archie would be out of work, up to his eyes in debt, and on the government teat.</comment>

<comment>So far Trump has said that McCain was a loser for being taken prisoner, and that Bush should have been impeached for ignoring the CIA warnings and lying about WMDs. Essentially he is testing the loyalty of his voters by destroying the previous Republican Party presidential  candidates on stage just as he said he could shoot somebody on 5th avenue and still have his supporters.There is no way the Republican Party officials and operatives can ignore this if he still wins SC.The other candidates can't get to the right of Trump on immigration or be more anti-Muslim nor kinder to the 1% on tax promises.</comment>

<comment>You're still thinking in the old paradigm. It's not Democrat Vs. Republican anymore, it's Nationalist Vs. Globalist.</comment>

<comment>Trump will win voters from all parties.</comment>

<comment>Trump basically has been in general election mode since day one and he is going to win.</comment>

<comment>I hope not but it sure looks that way.</comment>

<comment>I'll vote for the Democrat, but at this point I'd rather see Trump than anyone else in the GOP clown car.</comment>

<comment>Eminent domain wasn't an own goal. It was a strategy. Put that out there, then I tie Jeb! to W. Ted spent more time talking to Rubio than me. Why is that? I sucked the oxygen out of the room and swung down at Jeb! For most of it. Lol. Liberals don't really understand strategy. Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Conventional wisdom aside, Trump did not lose the debate last night -- not among the general electorate. He won there handedly. Indeed, last night's debate proved Trump has the broad appeal needed to become the next president of the United States. If the establishment Republicans don't like it, lump it. But they'd better line up behind him -- if they want the White House back.</comment>

<comment>Appeal to be president is not the same a capacity and to be president.Demagogue is a pejorative for a reason.</comment>

<comment>I'm with you, M W, but clearly those of us who still think that character, ideological coherence, policy knowledge and basic adult self-control matter in a President are a shrinking minority.Our political culture has been swallowed by a combination of WWE Wrestling, Jerry Springer, and the dumbest reality teevee shows.  Loudest, crudest clown wins it all.</comment>

<comment>Who cares if he loses.the Trump on his worst bad hair day is a better alternative to hillary/bernie.And as far as the GOP,let the best candidate win.</comment>

<comment>The best way to honor Scalia and his fidelity to the Constitution and the rule of law is to follow the Constitution, and to vote quickly to confirm President Obama's nominee.</comment>

<comment>Or reject the nominee based on his or her merits -- but a blanket rejection of ANY nominee is disgusting, IMO.</comment>

<comment>Right - honor the Constitution.It's really a recent thing that Justices are not confirmed with regularity.</comment>

<comment>Uh, no</comment>

<comment>Uh, yes.</comment>

<comment>Good luck, they will block everything </comment>

<comment>MaybeThing is, we can't let threats from America's ISIS affect our commitment to the rule of law.</comment>

<comment>The Senate is well within their rights to confirm or not.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that is true.The Constitution provides a way for the Senate to confirm: through a vote. Not through denying the President his Constitutional authority to nominate, and for the Senate to consider through a vote.These are grown men, acting as if they don't have the responsibility to fulfill their oath of office.</comment>

<comment>So you would feel better if they went through the motions, then said no? That's fine.</comment>

<comment>No, that's not what I said.I said that the President has the Constitutional authority to nominate, and the Senate has the Constitutional duty to confirm. (Senators can decide to vote "No," of course.)Unless you think doing your sworn duty is going through the motions, of course.Don't you think Senators should take their duties seriously?</comment>

<comment>They should. But I'm from CA., so you know.</comment>

<comment>Ah. Well, then, I hope things go well here w/r/t this issue.I realize it does involve politics. But still, we have a declared adherence to the Constitution. We should at least try to follow it.</comment>

<comment>I'm a staunch conservative, but more liberal leaning on issues such as Planned Parenthood. Trump works for me, and I have to respect for changing the political conversation in this country. We had gotten used to liberals advancing their platform by inhibiting speech and repressing debate - not healthy in a free society.</comment>

<comment>If Trump had pursed his lips any harder last night they would have popped right off of his face, and then what would he campaign on?</comment>

<comment>Eyelashes?</comment>

<comment>He's still got the hair, dude.</comment>

<comment>That could pop off next if he blows his lid during a fake tantrum.</comment>

<comment>I love how the debate crowds cheer the rampant xenophobic bullsh!# and calls for torture, but when Trump actually makes sense re: the Iraq War and PP . . "Now he"s gone too far!"I don't think this hurts him though. At least 50% of the Republican Party doesn't buy the Fox News dogma that anything W did foreign policy wise was sacrosanct. Also, he had made these comments before: they aren't new for him, and in SC he's pulling close to 40% of the vote. Cut him down 10% (and I don't think that happens) and he still wins handidly.While I'm not a Trump fan I do love how he's making right wing establishment d-bags like Bill Krystal completely loses their sh÷%. That big Natonal Journal edition where the "intellectual titans" of conservatism all came out against him. And a huge swath of Republican voters basically give them the middle finger. Good for them.</comment>

<comment>You want to understand Mr. Trump, study Huey P. Long.</comment>

<comment>And read Sinclair Lewis' "It Can't Happen Here!"</comment>

<comment>An amazing spectacle.Four guys competing for who can lose the least votes for every infinitesimal deviation from movement conservative orthodoxy, while the fifth guy barks 5th-grader interpretations of everyone from Michael Moore to Mussolini and only goes up in the polls.Well, we had a good 250 year run, America.</comment>

<comment>If one goes by Scalia's belief that the Constitution should be interpreted in the light of the time it was written, then Cruz is not a natural born American.</comment>

<comment>And the Second Amendment only covers muskets and breechloaded single shot pistols.</comment>

<comment>When The Many Stop Fearing The Few...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Trump actually told the truth which was a shocker! The Iraq war was a mistake and there were no WMD's. Bush administration did have prior intelligence but had already made their mind up they were going to get Saddam Hussein regardless. Even though he had absolutely nothing to do with 911. Hundreds of lives lost our military and civilians in Iraq and Republicans have the nerve to say how much they love our brave fighting men and women! The military were used. The sad thing is so many vets still vote GOP when even to this day the GOP do nothing for them! That is totally mind blowing! As for Ben Carson why is he even still here? The man is so out of his league and his answers are so ridiculous he only makes a fool of himself. Rubio the robot has delusions of grandeur. Jeb is getting to be like Rubio with his repeating of 'we need a proven leader, I am that that leader'. Kasich tries to calm the children down but they are out of control so he attempts to make common sense until Jeb gets ticked off and chimes in. Then we have Cruz the one who thinks he's oh so smart but is a drifty trickster no surprise there he's a Republican after all. It's like watching a circus act. It's really embarrassing to watch but watch I must.</comment>

<comment>The Republican Party needs to change or it will be relegated to the dustbin of history.</comment>

<comment>Today Trump is a danger to the Republican Party, if elected, tomorrow he will be a danger to America. There are many reasons he should not be elected. This is just one: Why has NO ONE asked Trump about how he got out of the military draft during the debates? Look it up for yourself. And as you read it remember how healthy he looks as an old man and how much he brags about his energy. And now, he wants to be Commander-in-Chief ---Shameful. If that is not bad enough, Trump has called veteran POWs losers for getting captured. As president would he make fun of our captured soldiers?</comment>

<comment>Saturday night was truly entertaining lmao. From the Cuban confrontation to Trump calling Ted Cruz a liar to his face. Oh this was one train wreck I could not look away from lol *still giggling*</comment>
