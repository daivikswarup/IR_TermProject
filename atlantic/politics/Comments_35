<comment>Criminal justice reform is a liberal cause. Why should Republicans help them out? Let them rot in prison.</comment>

<comment>It is very difficult to find a moderate Republican anywhere and liberal Republicans are extinct. That a Republican controlled House and Senate would consider criminal justice reform strongly suggests your assertion that this is a liberal cause is wrong.</comment>

<comment>Why give the impression that Congress can get anything done? It will just energize the party of government.Besides, prison guards are good paying working class jobs. We could use more of them.</comment>

<comment>(1) Why the GOP is now seriously considering criminal justice reform: because the heroin and prescription-opiod epidemic is hitting blue-collar whites hard. As long as it was mostly black people's loved ones rotting in prison for decades, "tough on crime" was red meat for the GOP base. But now that white people's loved ones are facing the same fate, that fate has suddenly become inhumanely harsh. One of about a zillion pertinent recent articles: http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10...(2) Actually—I am not making this up—unions that represent prison guards have lobbied against reducing criminal sentences, on the ground that prisons provide employment in rural areas where other jobs are scarce. Really.FWIW: a high school classmate of mine (class of 1979) lost her 29-year-old daughter to an overdose last year. White, in a heavily Republican area in the south. She left three little girls under age 10.</comment>

<comment>"It is very difficult to find a moderate Republican anywhere..."Nonsense.  It may be tough to find moderate Republicans on TV or message boards, but that's a very different thing than "anywhere".  Despite what we may all be led to believe, the majority of Republicans (as opposed to Republican voters perhaps) are likely moderate.</comment>

<comment>The problem is what's been defined as "moderate." The following are now "moderate," mainstream GOP positions: tax cuts pay for themselves. Global warming is a hoax. Unemployment is due to laziness. Raising the minimum wage would kill jobs. Cutting the budget deficit speeds economic recovery. The best sex education is abstinence-only. Expanding Medicaid harms a state's economy. 10 million undocumented immigrants can and should be deported. Most Muslims are security threats. No gun control measures are acceptable, other than "thoughts and prayers." Yes, there are plenty of those kinds of "moderates."</comment>

<comment>I would agree that the definition certainly colors one's assessment of this as a 'problem'.  However, I'd disagree about whether the positions you've listed have nearly as much support as is generally assumed.  In my opinion, there's a very vocal minority who hold those views, and they're covered as though they're the majority because it makes for much more interesting copy, and allows for more righteous indignation.  But maybe I'm wrong.</comment>

<comment>I'm judging what's mainstream-GOP by its leading elected officials, and what they will or won't fund or otherwise implement with legislation—not (mostly) by their words.</comment>

<comment>Which is logical.  Unfortunately, the moderate Republicans who are succeeding in governing aren't making the news much.  There are plenty of Governors who might fit this category who we rarely or never hear about (though I'll add that many of them also do stupid things that moderates might disagree with, like advocating for 'religious freedom' legislation).To your point though, Congress is at this point full of ideologues of all stripes.  Hence the gridlock.  Ideological gridlock makes for great press.</comment>

<comment>There's good policy-making for you: Liberals want it? DO THE OPPOSITE!!! Cogent and effective, that.</comment>

<comment>So after years of effort, by folks across the political spectrum, we're down to only two obstacles.  That's pretty amazing in this political environment.  There's enough irony in the first - "my next opponent might lie about what the law does and make me look bad to ignorant voters" - to let it slide.On the other hand, the changes proposed to the knowledge requirement in prosecutions, comes across as nothing more than a poison pill.  Fundamentally, the "tough on crime" contingent is saying, "If you want to reduce the amount of time criminals spend in prison, then you're going to have to let us make sure fewer criminals get sent there in the first place."  It is curious that the most apparent beneficiaries of the changes would be corporate/white collar criminals.It's also interesting to note that Trey Gowdy, the Conservative prosecutorial poster child, opposes increasing the mens rea burden.</comment>

<comment>“I don’t see a whole lot of Willie Horton fodder there, quite frankly,” said Mark Holden, senior vice president of Koch Industries and spokesman for the conservative Charles Koch, who is helping to bankroll the campaign for criminal-justice reform.If the evil Koch brothers are for it then it is the duty of every progressive to oppose it because it clearly is just a stalking horse for their nefarious plans.</comment>

<comment>You know what they say about a stopped clock.  Welcome aboard, Charles Koch and your money too!</comment>

<comment>Once again, it looks like far-right ideologues are scuttling legislation that is widely supported, both by the public and by a wide spectrum of legislators from both sides of the aisle, simply because they aren't getting every. single. f**king. thing. they. want. How much longer are we as a country going to put up with this childish tantrum-throwing?</comment>

<comment>I'd rather decent, hard working American citizens be able to live safely in their homes and safely walk their streets. That is an issue in every city in America, especially for women and children. Because: Predators and violent criminals with not even a reasonable facsimile of a conscience whom the courts keep returning to the streets in our revolving door criminal justice system that few young males fear, even as juvenile criminals. </comment>

<comment>Funny I literally just spent three hours doing the Incompetent to Stand Trial Thursday Morning Calendar at the Hall of Justice, and this does not represent my experience over the last ten years. But, you know, facts and all haven't stopped you before, no reason they should now.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that just rubber stamping them *GUILTY*?I understand it's virtually impossible these days to get insanity or incompetent.</comment>

<comment>Incompetency to stand trial very much depends on the why question. Of the four cases I was involved with today, one resulted in a dismissal of all charges and release from custody because competency could not be restored, and another in a sentence of 25 to life at a state hospital because competency could not be restored and the individual posed a danger to the community. In other words, it was a Thursday.</comment>

<comment>The Republican Party is willing to commit to both Criminal Law Reform and Regulatory Law Reform and they are the bad guys?  Since you can get serious jail time for the violation of either, it makes sense to make them both more just.</comment>

<comment>Sabotaging efforts at reform seems to me to be an odd way to go about reforming anything.</comment>

<comment>With Latinos and blacks growing to be the majority population in the US, it is necessary to reform the criminal justice system.  After all, you can't have a large portion of the majority of the US population in prison, right?  The rule of law in the US is slowly being dissolved, but that will be fitting for the impoverished nation that will be America.</comment>
