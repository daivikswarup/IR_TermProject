<comment>What about the campaign claims that though Clinton's proportion of women is higher, Sanders has donations from a larger number of women? I'm surprised this article didn't bother to examine those claims. </comment>

<comment>Don't respond, it is a redirect to political advertisement to raise money for Hillary, but they steal your credit card info.  There are tons of these on the internet now.</comment>

<comment>Haha.  I'm stealing this.</comment>

<comment>Some Hillary supporters like to think politically active women just sprung from the ground when Clinton decided to run again. While higher proportions of men donated to campaigns before than now, I think some people underestimate how much influence women had over the donation and voting patterns of the men in their lives especially their partners. It may even be a little sexist to discount their previous influence because it helps Clinton's narrative since as they say: Behind every great man, there is a woman..</comment>

<comment>This shows women don't pay attention to the issues.  Hillary is awful.</comment>

<comment>Gee, that's a well reasoned and supported argument. Resorting to empty, personal insult is usually the strategy of people unfamiliar with, and unconcerned about, the issues.</comment>

<comment>Some will vote for her just because she is a woman . One can't discount that fact.</comment>

<comment>For more than 200 years people have voted, again and again and again, for presidents just because they were men. In fact, most of our presidential campaigns, at least as long as I've been alive, have been fought over who was the bigger, more macho man.Campaigns have ended because someone thought they saw the candidate cry. Too unmanly. Campaigns have fought over whether one candidate was a "wimp" or not. War service has been insulted or extolled in an effort to prove or undermine the manliness of the candidates. Political attacks and endless media stories have been based in what kind of sport the candidate plays. Votes and political approval have been bestowed based on which guy was guy enough to make him someone "you'd want to have a beer with." Candidates have used violent language and fear mongering to convince voters of their manliness, and on and on and on.What does any of that crap have to do with the issues?</comment>

<comment>'For more than 200 years people have voted, again and again and again, for presidents just because they were men.'what does that mean when men have been in power since forever and american women didn't achieve suffrage until fairly recently?maybe you're ok with women saying they'll vote for hillary because she's a woman and it's 'time', therefore bring on the disaster, but i'm not. these older women who are so blinded by identity politics that they'd settle for hillary are so sad - as a feminist i owe it to myself to not vote for hillary.i live in california and have had to deal with nancy pelosi, dianne feinstein, barbara boxer - no thank you to more incompetent women in office.</comment>

<comment>It means that men were not only not voting for women, because they were women, they weren't granting them suffrage or the right to run for office for a very long time. (American women were asking for the vote in the colonies -- and a few colonial counties did grant women of property the vote. That right was taken away in the revolution.)But this isn't really a matter of men vs. women. As you point out, women have been voting for men and shunning women too. The fact is, a woman president is a HUGE cultural change and many women find it just as frightening.But another fact is, in a modern economy, in which families and the economy itself are so dependent on the work women do, women can't afford to sit on the political sidelines anymore.The "you're only voting for her because she's a woman" criticism is just silly in the context of a culture in which so many people said for so long that they wouldn't cast a vote for a woman -- because she was a woman.And it is doubly ridiculous from people who claim to be progressive.Anyway, nobody is voting for Hillary just because she's a woman. They are voting for her because she has been an out-in-front champion on so many issues that are important to them. And they are voting for a principle that they believe is very important; women's equal representation and participation in our political life and conversation.That is probably not something that matters to you. Asking that trite question is just one, very dishonest, way that people who don't give a damn about the issue try to dismiss it as an issue.</comment>

<comment>erm did you not understand that my problem with hillary is her politics, not her sex?'Anyway, nobody is voting for Hillary just because she's a woman.'if you truly believe that, i invite you out to san francisco and oakland. i have had neighbors justify their support for hillary with 'it's her time' (what kind of nonsense is that? political affirmative action?). then again, all that matters here is that you're not republican - that's why this area is so dysfunctional.hillary will never be president and she's not fit to represent me, nor entitled to my vote because i'm a woman. some of us still have values and vote based on who can actually do the best job. get over it.</comment>

<comment>The percentage of women voting for Hillary just because she's a woman is small. Smaller than, historically, the percentages for Catholics voting for Catholics or Southerners voting for Southerners. I notice you aren't accusing Mormons of voting for Romney because of identity politics.People vote in their self-interests. If Hillary is focusing on issues that matter to women (medical access, for example), then more women will vote for her.</comment>

<comment>i don't care about that (mormons, catholics, religion). again: i'm a woman and hillary doesn't represent my politics. so what if she's pro-choice? abortion is not my number one issue but i guess if it was, i'd still be voting for bernie.</comment>

<comment>Jimmy Carter got elected because he was a macho man?  Right.....</comment>

<comment>sorry but i wasn't born when he was president and i'm not sure what your point is?</comment>

<comment>The system deleted the comment I was posting to and somehow attached it to yours.  Just a glitch.</comment>

<comment>Honestly, they didn't vote "just because" they were men... Candidates could only be white men. Period. That's a problem, sure. But voting for someone "just because" they're a woman? That would be like saying it wouldn't matter if we elected Sarah Palin.</comment>

<comment>Nobody votes for anyone "just because" they are a woman.Don't you understand that that is why that question is absurd and insulting. It is in fact meant to be insulting. It is meant to demean both women voters and female candidates.Men never get asked that question when they vote for men. And that is my point; it would be a nonsensical question. Just as nonsensical as asking if, or suggesting that, the only reason a woman would vote for a woman is because she is a woman.In asking that question people are actually saying that they think women are too stupid to understand issues and vote based in their understanding of the issues of the day, and their principles. They are also taking it as a given that the female candidate in question has nothing to offer as a candidate.</comment>

<comment>well, no. that's not what i see happening. They're talking specifically about a HIlary candidate. Not an Elizabeth Warren, not a Carlie Fiorina. Not a Sarah Palin.. which we all could say funny things about . It all amounts to less that they are women, and how we feel about what they represent.</comment>

<comment>They are talking about the actual candidate. You are the one thinking the only reason they would talk about her is because she is a woman.You are dismissing all women, who don't support the candidate you support, as women, when you do so. Poor little dears, so empty headed they can't see that Bernie is the RIGHT candidate because they are blinded by the fact that the other candidate -- the lying, screechy voiced, corrupt, thick ankled harridan -- is a woman.</comment>

<comment>Jimmy Carter got elected because he was a macho man?  Right.......</comment>

<comment>Jimmy Carter got elected because Nixon was a crook and Ford pardoned him.That was one of few elections where both candidates were guys who didn't make an issue of it. Poor Ford was a good athlete in his youth but as president the media made an issue of his every stumble and fall. And, he had an ex-alcoholic, feminist wife. Many people loved Betty, but an outspoken feminist -- no matter how graciously she spoke -- didn't enhance her husband's macho image with his fellow Republicans.And of course Jimmy Carter only served one term -- losing to a swaggering dime store  cowboy whose campaign did all they could to make his opponent look like a commie-loving weakling.Which they did very well -- 36 years later you still believe the cliche.</comment>

<comment>What about Carly Fiorina? She isn't close to getting the GOP nomination. I think women trust Hillary because she is a woman and she is a woman who falls in line with their views on issues.It only makes sense to trust someone that has through the same experiences as you.</comment>

<comment>No more than some men supporting the man in an election because he's a man.</comment>

<comment>Name one thing Hillary has accomplished.</comment>

<comment>She married an up and comer from Arkansas.</comment>

<comment>The massive explosion of government spending and interference in our lives didn't really start until after women were given the right to vote in 1919 and started using it to "make us safer".  There is a reason we call big intrusive government the "Nanny State".As a comic illustration of this point consider the "Moms Against Everything" page (yes, it is parody):https://www.facebook.com/momsa...</comment>

<comment>The non- partisan FBI is investigating her, and she is about to be indicted.  Wake up sleepy head.  Women are not stupid.</comment>

<comment>Do you fall for every piece of partisan  propaganda? The FBI hasn't been investigating HER  --  as they've said many times -- they've been, at the request of the Republicans investigating her emails to see if any classified info was sent by mistake.Secretary Powell also used his private email for government business. And, unlike Clinton, destroyed them when he left office. Karl Rove worked an office away from W where he carried on all his government business on a private email system. And destroyed it all after leaving office. Jeb Bush also used his private email system and private server to conduct business when he was governor of Florida -- and destroyed it all when he left office.That's what careless people and crooks do.You Republicans are so naive. Many of you are angry now, because the establishment has been leading you around by the nose with false narratives and lies for the last 30+ years.But you still don't realize that the problem isn't the con men who take advantage of you -- its you, the voters who just keep looking for a better con man with better lies.</comment>

<comment>That was a ruse by the WH - then they repeated it, and now the FBI is even more pissed.  http://www.thegatewaypundit.co...The IG was appointed by Obama; he's not a Republican.How about a woman's perspective on Hillary, by Elizabeth Warren; now this seems like a con to me:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Not true stop the smear and spreading lies</comment>

<comment>Right. In the history of democracy, no male politicians who supported terrible policies have ever been popular. When only men could vote, the best guy for the job was elected every time.</comment>

<comment>Maybe we need to go back to only men voting.</comment>

<comment>I wish you would analyze what Clinton and Sanders supporters will do if the other candidate wins?I've been to see both Clinton and Saunders speak. I'm a Clinton supporter; born in the year the birth-control pill was introduced (1960, for those of you who don't know.) I hope she wins, and I will contribute financially and my time to help make that happen. But I won't mind if Saunders wins, either; I think it does the Democratic Party proud that we have three -- and I include O'Malley here -- such fine candidates running for president.I'll work my tail of for Hillary. I'll celebrate if she wins. But I'll also support Saunders or O'Malley, were either of them to win the nomination. The alternative would be abominable; not one person running for president on the Republican ticket is qualified or morally responsible enough to be president of this country. They oppose, to a person, responsibility to this beautiful planet we live on for future generations. They totally fail to see that one of the easiest paths to conserving our home for the future is by respecting women's rights as human rights. That's the Hillary Doctrine; the basis of our foreign policy. When women have reproductive, education, and economic rights as their human rights, their communities become more peaceful, more prosperous and cleaner places; their children thrive. Republicans talk about Muslims and terrorism; but if you look at what those frightening terrorists do, it's suppress the human rights of women and girls first. Sadly, Republicans want to do that, too.So I'd like Hillary. But I'll take Bernie, too.Would those folk out there who feel the Bern be willing to stand up for Hillary should she prevail? That's what I'd like to know.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't bother you at all her numerous changing her stories on the e mails or the BIG money shes taking from the Wall Street types or the "women who have been sexually assaulted deserve to be heard " after the things she said about women when her Husband was POTUS?</comment>

<comment>It certainly amuses me that you think this reflect reality. You're a well-trained puppy. I'm sure Trump will through you a bone.</comment>

<comment>Gees I ask a serious question and get insulted . How liberal of you .</comment>

<comment>If you'd asked a serious question, I would have responded. You asked a loaded questions with all sorts of built-in assumptions I don't agree. I can't answer your question, because I don't agree that your assumptions are true; they're half-truths and innuendo.</comment>

<comment>So you are claiming that I am assuming the things that she has said?  Video tape does not "assume" except in your "reality"</comment>

<comment>Hello, since you seem to be working for the Clinton campaign, could I ask you a favor?I am a former-warlord  and now "President" of an oil-rich West African country.I would like to give the Clinton Foundation $5 million in return for future political favors.Could you please put me in contact with her?</comment>

<comment>Is this really the new thing? Suggest anyone who supports Clinton is on the payroll?Wow.That's pathetic.</comment>

<comment>I also have a very influential and dignified friend from Kazakhstan who would also like to give $5 million US.Please contact Hillary as soon as possible.</comment>

<comment>The suggestion is that foreigners who donated to her family foundation might be expecting political paybacks.</comment>

<comment>Is this also your version of honesty and integrity:In a recent debate, Hillary said the following, "Sen Sanders, you’re the only one on this stage that voted to deregulate the financial markets in 2000, ... to make the SEC and the CFTC no longer able to regulate swaps and derivatives, which were one of the main causes of the collapse in ’08."This is a prime example of Hillary's dishonesty and lack of integrity. The above statement is factually true, but it requires some serious caveats. The legislation she's talking about was the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, which was tucked into an omnibus spending bill at the last second and signed off by, you guessed it, Bill Clinton (the same Bill Clinton who repealed Glass-Steagall, but leave that aside for now).One of the main authors of this legislation was Gary Gensler, a man who worked at Goldman Sachs for 18 years and is now Hillary's TOP ECONOMIC ADVISOR. Gensler, Robert Rubin, Larry Summers and others pushed for the total deregulation of toxic financial instruments which led directly to the global financial collapse of 2008.So Hillary condemned Bernie for voting for a disastrous piece of legislation that was written and very publicly supported by her top economic advisor. She has 0 integrity. Shameful.</comment>

<comment>Oh Bernie bro enough pls stop this smear and lies </comment>

<comment>Try again Pia .Vast right wing conspiracy indeed . That says all I need to know about you dufus.</comment>

<comment>I think you're a paid Hillary plant.No one LIKES Hillary.I live in NYC.  She had her campaign kickoff here, in the state that she theoretically represented in the Senate.About 8 people showed up.  Sanders, a geriatric socialist kook, draws crowds ten times the size of hers.I love the idea that Hillary stands for anything besides Clinton Inc.If she's such an advocate for women, how do you explain her smearing every woman who had a sexual encounter with her rapey husband, Bill?;)</comment>

<comment>I think your'e right George / She was Shilling over at MJ for the book "The Hillary Doctrine"</comment>

<comment>Have you read it? I was 'schilling' for  a discussion of it. It is, after all, a serious analysis of how Clinton's foreign policy lays out a foundation for dealing with other nations premised on the idea that human rights include women's rights.Were I to hazard, I'd guess you've never read it, only read of it. Like that dude that inspired Rebecca Solnit to coin the term "mansplaining."</comment>

<comment>Hillary wants to BOMB BOMB BOMB.BOMB BOMB BOMB BOMB.I agree - enough of that cautious Obama!I want to back to the great days of George W. Bush's foreign policy.We need a neocon in office.All her instincts as Secretary of State were dead on.</comment>

<comment>Hillary knows about as much on foreign policy as you do about reality.</comment>

<comment>Were I to hazard,You couldn't "splain" your way out of a wet paper bag honey .</comment>

<comment>I remember how invading Iraq really helped improve the rights of women in Iraq! I guess after their kids were killed by bombs, the women had more time to organize political lunches, attend gender rights meetings, organize to resist their sexist husbands, etc. Way to go, Hillary!</comment>

<comment>Yeah. Don't bring up her hawkish foreign policy. Regime change by any other name would smell just as sweet....</comment>

<comment>Paid?No.Just sick of thinking that I'm not supposed to be joyful about Clinton's campaign. Like I'm not supposed to talk about periods and labor pains and nursing and what asses some men can be after they've had a drink or two and start hitting on women.You don't get to define the discussion, I do. Hillary's had her man problems to deal with just like most women. Our decisions are complicated and personal, and they often are forced by the men in our lives acting like children instead of adults.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is a reptilian corporatist ghoul.Her BIGGEST achievement in life - between exiting the White House and this presidential run - has been transforming herself into a rich plutocrat like her rich plutocrat friends.She stands for nothing besides Clinton self interests.Plus she's a pretty lousy campaigner.  All the sleaze and moral compromise of Bill Clinton without the wit and charm.If you're hanging your hat on her, it's pretty pathetic.Say what you want about Obama, but he came out of the sewer that is Chicago/Illinois politics squeaky clean.No shady billion-to-one $100,000 cattle futures bets in Obama's past.</comment>

<comment>But, but.. she was a woman on 9/11!</comment>

<comment>It is highly highly highly likely that Hillary has ovaries.This is something her campaign should run on.  It is a good message.</comment>

<comment>"You don't get to define the discussion, I do."Achtung, baby!We'll all be silent now, awaiting your permission to join the discussion you have defined.Ovaries for President!</comment>

<comment>Wow. That's a mature rant.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders needs help finding his pants in the morning, and supports an economic program that's attractive to 3% of the country.And he's slapping HRC silly in Iowa and NH.I wonder what would have happened if the Democrats had any bench and someone legit ran against her this election.</comment>

<comment>Oh, isn't it obvious? Same thing that happened last time.</comment>

<comment>Obama, a relative neophyte, decapitated her, despite her initial establishment support.She's a terrible candidate.</comment>

<comment>She never had establishment support. The New England liberal establishment, led by Teddy and Kerry, and the Midwestern moderate establishment -- Daschle, Gephart and others -- opposed Clinton, and championed Obama very early. It was thanks to those extremely important parts of the "Democratic establishment" that Obama was able to rake in more Wall Street money -- very, very early -- than ANY primary candidate had ever received. More money than general campaign candidates usually received. Certainly more money than Hillary.The "inevitability" story was a fiction of the media. The only part of the establishment that was willing to take a risk on a woman were those friendly with Bill Clinton -- an "establishment" that contained a higher number of women than the rest of the party, by the way, but many of them were also uncertain.Most likely, many of those early Obama supporters, who supported him despite his very meager political experience, thought that an election in which W's failures gave Dems such a good chance to win, might nonetheless be a risky waste if the only viable candidate was a woman. A woman had never even won a Democratic  primary at that point.Hillary's real support has been progressive women. And women are the most important voters in the Democratic party -- they can't win national elections without a lot of them showing up. She actually won, in direct votes, slightly more votes than Obama. But with the super-delegates (definitely the "establishment") and his success in the caucus states (red states that mostly wouldn't go for a Democrat in the election) he got more delegates.If she gets the nomination this time it will because those voters turn out for her again, and because she has a better strategy in the low-attendence caucus states and a little more support among the establishment (the Kennedy and Daschle factions aren't what they use to be and there are big problems with the establishment supporting a nominee who is a a member of, and has never had any loyalty to, the party).We'll see. A candidate depending, as Bernie says he is, on a huge turnout of college students and people who haven't voted Democratic in the past, isn't very likely to succeed.But, McGovern managed to pull it off. And Bernie is of the usual, non-revolutionary gender.Of course, we all know how that eventually turned out.It's what the Republicans are hoping for.</comment>

<comment>This is nonsense.Hillary went into the 2008 primary with WAY WAY WAY more money and much more establishment support than Obama had.Obama came in and flogged her.  2008 didn't have an inevitability narrative.  2016 does.  She flexed her establishment muscle to have every possible advantage in the primaries.You argue Obama was a "safer choice"  in 2008 than Hillary?  A black guy over a rich, white woman?  That's a joke.  Obama is a much better politician and he came with a lot less baggage.The Democratic party has 3 legs:  White progressives, minority voters, and centrist corporatists.While Obama got support from all three factions, only centrist corporatists support Hillary.White progressives prefer Bernie.  And the aggrieved minority faction doesn't really have a candidate.While not in office, Hillary has spent her post First Lady career soliciting big money donations and palling around with oligarchs.That's who she is.  There's nothing progressive about her at all.We've NEVER had a female president.  That she can make people unexcited about the possibility of that happening is an indictment of just how toxic, corrupt, and unlikeable she is.</comment>

<comment>By the vote, Democrats were pretty excited in 2008. If you can't find a reason for dismissing that other than personally insulting her and the people who support and cast votes for her, you've got nothing.What she did in 2008 was history making. She won millions of votes -- more cast votes than the candidate who got the nomination. No women running for the nomination of a major party ever came anywhere close to that in the past. Margaret Chase Smith, who ran for the Republican nomination in 1964, got 222,007 votes. And that was the pretty phenomenal and amazing record -- until Hillary.Complain about it all you like, but Hillary is an important, and popular, figure in American politics.(I'm not sure that many of Bernie's supporters know what a progressive is.)</comment>

<comment>He's right to the extent that this is nonsense... Very very important you recognize that Obama was backed by the establishment fairly early on, over Clinton.But let's be real. They did not snub Hillary because she was a woman, but because Obama, with the prospects of being the first African American president, who was able to reach out to the widest possible demographics, was the better candidate. Neither was up to the task, and Hillary's tenure as Secratary of State tells me how she would run the Presidency, and I will never vote for her again.But Clinton is the more loyal to the party, and is using her largess to fund democrats campaigns, which has been an effective way to get the elected behind her - so far.</comment>

<comment>They supported Obama for a lot of good reasons. But that doesn't mean sexism didn't play a part in their unwillingness to support Clinton.I'm not the only woman who was bitterly disappointed by this fact: there was a huge amount of sexism in the media and from our (Democrats) own ranks -- aimed not only at Clinton but also at the women who supported her -- and those supposedly progressive leaders in the party never called it out. Never in one instance stepped up to make it clear that they saw it as unacceptable. Doing so didn't require supporting Clinton -- it required having respect for, and supporting,  ALL the progressive, Democratic women who the party absolutely needs to win elections.It clearly demonstrated WHY decades of loyalty to and work for the party hadn't gained women ANY wins on the issues they cared about.Obama had the good sense, after winning election, to try to mend some fences by getting the Lily Ledbetter act finally passed, and making Clinton his secretary of state. But believe me, 2008 made clear how hard it was for Democratic leaders -- all male --  to grant women, and, most important, their issues, equal standing and attention.</comment>

<comment>She's a progressive who has been on the front line of change, and the recipient of harsh attack, since she was very young. Sanders is an eccentric guy who has kept himself aloof from the fight, and criticism, by never joining a party and working, and fighting, with others to get big things done. But, he's a guy. And many in the party are afraid a woman can't win and are too cowardly to let a competent woman have a chance to prove or disprove that.Voting for Bernie -- or saying you will -- let's you pretend you re a revolutionary without having to take the flak, or the chances, that comes with proving it.We won't know until the voting starts how cowardly the Democrats really are.</comment>

<comment>What change has Hillary been on the front line of?What lurks in her dark heart?The crown legislative jewels of the Clinton pregnancy were the Defense of Marriage Act, Don't Ask Don't Tell, and welfare reform.Not exactly landmark progressive legislation.So what then?  What does she stand for?  What is she great at?By all accounts (from the Left and the Right) she as a lousy Secretary of State who has neo-con instincts.As a Senator, she did nothing.Her main achievement in life has been amassing a $100,000,000 slush fund.She gets in trouble not for her politics but her sleaziness: improbable cattle futures bets, top secret stuff on a server in her bathroom, bloodying Bill's bimbos, etc. etc. etc.The NY Times editorial page likes Hillary.  But read the actual NY Times coverage of her campaign by reporters following it.  They can't stand her.  They can't stand the stink and they're pinching their noses.My feeling is that a lot of people voting for Bernie aren't really voting for Bernie.  They're voting against Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Bill's career is not Hillary's. Laura Bush supported abortion rights -- did pro-life Republicans refuse to vote for him because of it?If you haven't bothered to read anything about Hillary's career -- her early involvement in expanding health care access, fighting for women and children's rights, improving education in one of the poorest states in the country, proposing a universal health care plan for the nation that was considerably left of Obama's and brought the ugly wrath of the insurance industry down on her head -- you probably have never had any real interest in those progressive issues.You are either a Republican, or a Dem who most likely doesn't care as much for progressive causes as they do for the fact that Bernie isn't a woman.</comment>

<comment>Uh cool.So "expanding health care access, fighting for women and children's rights, improving education in one of the poorest states in the country"?This was like in the '80's?  When she was the wife of a small-time hick governor? A few hours here and there for good causes when she wasn't billing as a law partner?And then after she became First Lady, after she became an A-list political power broker who was actually capable of doing big things, what did she spend her time doing then?Soliciting "donations" from Algerians, Nigerians, Emeratis, and Wall Street plutocrats.That's her passion.Getting that big money.Hill and Bill's health care plan was a disaster.  It was a clumsy mishandling of a major opportunity.  It wasn't that it was "too progressive;"  it was a failure, a political face plant.Look, I despise Clinton.  I think there's a good chance that she is completely soulless.That said, I am upper upper middle class and prefer my politicians moderate and corporatist.I would be FINE with someone who had a vagina and Hillary's crypto-conservative political orientation as president, if that person wasn't a scumbag.  And Hillary is.Furthermore, depending on who the Republicans nominate, I might actually vote for Hillary.Still, she's a disgusting person.  Pinch your nose and swallow.</comment>

<comment>Look at the way you talk about her. That personal hatred and vehemence isn't about issue disagreements.</comment>

<comment>Yeah exactly.She's a horrible sleaze.It's not her politics I find repugnant.</comment>

<comment>THey poll for that: no, they don't vote against Hillary - they're enthusiastic about Sanders campaign. </comment>

<comment>Well, you're just being a total ass. But of course, there's plenty of ammo out there against Clinton.But come on, your Trump pecker is hanging out. Wee, shriveled little thing.3%? Last I checked, it's well known that on issues such as single payer, regardless of which party we vote for, Americans are overwhelmingly in favor - even after Obama Care.  Millions of jobs rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure?  Uh, reigning in Wall Street? Free college tuition at public colleges and universities? Overturning citizens United?Who doesn't support these things? Besides Hillary Clinton</comment>

<comment>"But come on, your Trump pecker is hanging out. Wee, shriveled little thing."This is entertaining.It is the same out of work white guys who support both Trump and the Bern actually.Trump isn't anti government.  His populist nationalist rhetoric allows for a big entitlement state, as long those entitlements go to the right sorts of people. Wink wink.What Bern is proposing, Medicare for all, FREE college, YUGE jobs program, would almost double federal spending.YUGE taxes for the middle class.  Americans love entitlements and they love free stuff.  They don't love paying for it.If it came down to it, and Americans were forced to pay for all the "free" stuff with actual increased income taxes, 3% would be quite high.;)Feel the Bern.</comment>

<comment>You truly are an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Snark but no rebuttal.</comment>

<comment>There was nothing to rebut. It was just a senseless rant.</comment>

<comment>The saddest thing about Clinton's two campaigns is how they have revealed the shallowness of so many who call themselves "progressive."Women's rights are human rights, and "women's issues" are progressive issues -- as well as vital human issues affecting everyone; men, women, families, the young, the old, the vulnerable ill -- EVERYONE.In fact, without the work and dedication of women -- and the voters who most recently have keep the progressive flame alive in the Democratic party and kept the Democratic party alive through these decades of increasingly reactionary conservatism -- women -- there would never have been, nor would there be, a progressive movement.In 1992, when Bill Clinton ran and won and Hillary Clinton made universal Healthcare a national issue, my home town paper, the Seattle Times, didn't even list health care as an important issue in the upcoming campaign. Instead, at the bottom of their list of the issues they thought would be part of the discussion, they listed "Women's Issues" with a little * asterisk. At the bottom of the page, in 6 point type, that * explained what "Women's Issues" were -- "Healthcare, Education, Social Security, Abortion."It's thanks to committed women, Clinton especially, that those vital, progressive HUMAN issues are recognized as an important part of the conversation now. And why we are, step by step, doing what needs to be done; expanding access and affordability.Sanders talks about "single payer" as if it is the goal. But it's just a payment method, not the goal. The goal is universal, affordable care. Many sophisticated country's have excellent, universal health care systems, Germany for instance, that are universal, affordable AND multi-payer.He talks about "income inequality" without acknowledging the two huge contributors to it; the inequity in pay between "men's work" and "women's work" and the increasing number of families that must depend on "women's work" to survive and succeed, and the wage inequality experienced by minorities.The loss of our middle class is not the result of a war between the banks and the rest of us. The banks need to be regulated -- but doing so won't create one job or anything to address the demise of our middle class. Giving women and minorities a raise would do both.Women's issues are human issues, they are vital economic issues, they are vital social issues.If you claim to be a progressive and want to see progressive progress, you need to be aware of this -- without gender equality in political representation and participation, that WILL NEVER HAPPEN.If you can't vote to bring us another big step closer to that long sought for and needed goal, you are no progressive. And you are certainly no revolutionary.</comment>

<comment>"The banks need to be regulated -- but doing so won't create one job or anything to address the demise of our middle class. Giving women and minorities a raise would do both."So giving women a raise would create more jobs???   WowYou might want to research What Hillary paid the women at the State Dept compared to the men.</comment>

<comment>60% of American households depend on a woman's income as a major part of family income. Giving women a raise would bring many of those households into the middle class -- and help re-build a healthy consumer market. Consumers with disposable income in their pockets create jobs.One reason bank regulation is important -- and it is -- is because so many people today, so many families, are dependent on CREDIT -- high interest, ill-advised debt -- to survive.I'd rather see American households living off of good wages in a healthy, productive economy. Wouldn't you?Women are extraordinarily important in our economy. Their wages are important to their partners, their children, their parents and the community. And of course they have always had an equal responsibility to care for themselves as well as others -- the only thing they haven't had, and have spent more than a century trying to get,  is equal access to the economic and political tools that make that possible.The reason women's rights are important is because women have immense and important responsibilities.If you don't get that you aren't living in the real world, as it actually is, and, in fact, has always been.</comment>

<comment>You're missing a lot of what Bernie has said, does say.. You should visit his page and look at his proposals and weigh that against the facts of what Clinton has presented.Isn't that the only way to really decide who the best candidate is?</comment>

<comment>Trumpkins and BerniansMan oh man.We got so dumb so fast, America.No wonder the white working class is in bad shape.</comment>

<comment>I have looked at Bernie's page. Carefully. Health care reform has been a voting issue for me for more than 35 years. I know everything there is to know about the history of health care, health insurance, health care reform, in this country. In the early 90s I worked on the campaign of a very progressive health care reformer in my state who was running for insurance commissioner. I know the abuse that's handed out to someone like that trying to make change. But, she did prevail and she did make reforms that chased the bottom feeding insurers out of our state -- the ones that collect your premiums for years and come up with a nonsense minor thing in your history (you took antacids for a few months 15 years ago) to deny you coverage when you fall seriously ill. Thanks to her and her reforms we were set up to set up the ACA without a hitch -- one of the few states that is true of.I KNOW Bernie's plan is unworkable -- and that single payer is unpopular. Not because people are stupid but because the health care system we built up over the last 80-100 years created patient and provider expectations that can't be met by single payer. And because people are afraid of losing the freedom of choice as consumers and patients - a real American value, even though sometimes an unrealistic one. Also, that Sanders could have put forward in 2013 -- as he did, you can find supporter published explanations of the legislation on the internet -- a single payer proposal that left the states to set up their own system KNOWING, as he certainly should have known by then, that Republican controlled states would not even expand Medicaid for the working poor, is astounding to me. It shows how politically unrealistic he is.  The opposition, ideologically and morally, really doesn't even believe poor people should get the benefit of tax payer supported health care. That is not a position from which you can expect them to reach any sudden and reasonable compromise on such a big and fundamental re-ordering of the system, much less suddenly agree to set up workable single payer systems, exactly as the feds require, in their states. And those people control most of the states. (And the fact that single payer failed, politically, in Vermont doesn't make a good argument for its likelihood of success in some extremely resistant state in the deep South.)There are lots of good things about single payer that make it popular with the Left. But some major countries, Germany for one, have excellent and universal multi-payer health care systems. Bernie, and his supporters, sometimes seem to lose sight of the ball -- and the goal -- single payer isn't the goal. Excellent, affordable, universally accessible care is the goal. We're not there yet, but we're on the road to it. I don't want to leave that road to wander into the weeds for some stubborn ideologue who doesn't seem to understand much about his own country,Bernie thinks he's the only one with the "right" ideas. And he, and his followers, think they are more moral than everyone else. That is not a good attitude for winning elections. It's the same, fellow-American-despising hole uncompromising conservatives have, in recent years, been digging for themselves.We need at least one party that remembers how democracy works. A system like ours, designed to protect individual freedom, can never give any one person or faction everything it wants. That's frustrating, but, proceeding with patience and in good faith, and with respect for your opponents no matter how estranged from their values you feel, is the only way to get important things done.</comment>

<comment>wat you seem to be missing is he's running a campaign much like FDR ran in 1932, as the underdog. Which is actually why we are Democrats. You're a little bit hysterical. you wrongly assert Single Payer is unpopular... in what universe? Singe payer and breaking up the too big to fail banks are two of the most popular polices, taken in multiple polls. This hasn't diminished even after obamacare.</comment>

<comment>His campaign is NOTHING like FDR in 1932. If he gets the nomination, he won't be able to run a campaign like FDR either -- because unlike Roosevelt he won't be running against a failed incumbent, hugely detested by the American people, he will be running against someone who will be blaming everything Bernie criticizes about the economy on the incumbent, Obama.The campaign he wants to run, he should have run in 2008.Or, he should be running it now as an Independent or a Socialist.Sanders is running a purely personal character assassination campaign against Clinton. Did you see the Sanders supporter who questioned Clinton at the Iowa event? He asked her about "enthusiasm" and "dishonest" -- not about issues. He did that because that's the REAL attack Bernie's campaign is pushing against Clinton. Bernie's a saint Clinton's a *itch. Read the posts from his supporters on the internet. That's what they talk about. There is a reason for that. It's a very passive-aggressive campaign. Every time Clinton criticizes him on an actual ISSUE his spokesmen run out to tell the press that she has lied or make some other personal criticism of her, rather than address what she actually said about his proposal. It's a neat trick. Bernie does it too, when he is challenged in interviews about his proposals, instead of defending his proposals he just claims Clinton's criticism aren't honest -- when in fact she isn't the only one making the same criticisms. Paul Krugman for one, and others, have made factual rebuttals of or have expressed the same reservations Clinton does. When anyone other than Clinton does that, the campaign jumps out with the claim that they are Clinton supporters. Everybody's lying. Bernie doesn't have to answer any questions because they are all unfair and coming from the same "corrupt" establishment as Clinton.That's his campaign in this primary. And it is a very, very ugly one. NOTHING like FDR.What's he going to do in the General? Run as an independent and criticize the "establishment" which means the Obama administration? How will that work when he's running as a Democrat? Who will support and campaign for him? Can Clinton and her supporters do what she did for Obama after her defeat in 2008? Aggressively campaign for him? My God, She's evil! Why would Bernie want her anywhere near him! How can anyone believe anything the corrupt, lying *itch has to say? Is he going to run by savaging the party and the administration, which includes Clinton, that so graciously gave him a major party platform to run from? And how well will the people who he NEEDS to show up -- women and minorities -- feel about him when he does?It's little late for him to run against Bush. He is running now as a Democrat AGAINST Democrats. But the other guy in the general will be running against Democrats and making his argument for a different kind of change.FDRs campaign theme was "Happy Days Are Here Again." He didn't run an angry campaign promising a revolution. Quite the contrary. He in fact ran on some pretty conservative talking points -- but he governed as an agent of change, as needed, and the people supported him because they could see that something different was needed. In the campaign he let his hated opponent hang himself. While he was the amiable and comforting voice of optimism.Bernie doesn't do optimism.</comment>

<comment>you're unhinged. this isn't  a conversation</comment>

<comment>How are the women and children in Libya doing?  And Syria?  What about Honduras?  And tell me about the Ukraine, where Hillary accepted $10M in donations to the Foundation to help engineer a coup.  Oh, and Haiti.She is a neoliberal warmonger whose primary goal as SoS was to spread fracking when she wasn't bombing countries for corporate profits.</comment>

<comment>Those are places with long-standing problems and instability. Many are areas in which our, and the USSRs, Cold War meddling contributed to the political instability that has led to terrorism, warfare, and state breakdown today. During the Cold War we encouraged revolt against regimes we thought would not serve our interests, and assisted in putting down rebellions against, often tyrannical, regimes that did serve our interests. We used Special Forces, especially in South and Central America, and to a lesser extent Africa, to do these things in clandestine military actions that the American people knew nothing about at the time and that are still classified and top secret today.As a member of Special Forces -- a Green Beret -- my deceased husband saw action in the Congo and all through Central America in the mid-1960s. Many of those actions were undertaken to protect and promote the interests of American business in the region, and are still classified today. The idealism and willingness to sacrifice for their country of young Americans has been abused by administration after administration. But the problems Honduras and the rest of the region suffer from don't all arise from American political meddling and greed. The region itself has a shaky support for democracy and a penchant for militarism. Costa Rica, one of the more stable and economically successful countries in the region made the decision decades ago to NOT invest in an army and instead invest in its people and its economy. That decision paid off.We, on the other hand, will still continue to be the world's police force sadly enough. But, unlike the Republican opposition, Hillary has never indulged in war mongering insistence on an ever bigger and more wasteful defense budgets, and their endless list of new enemies we must prepare to fight.We also have been and are the biggest arms sellers in the world -- contributing to worldwide instability while making big profits for arms dealers and the defense industry. We even allow terrorists to buy military style weapons in this country because we don't want to hurt the profits of gun makers. A point on which Bernie's record isn't stellar. A vote against holding the gun industry accountable to consumers and public safety did not show the good judgement he always claims to have -- baed on just one vote. We just have to take his word that he does possess all these wonderful qualities he claims for himself but has never, because he has kept himself so safe and aloof from the fight by being "independent" of the responsibilities that come with working with diverse others in a party, demonstrated. And anything in his record that indicates he may be human and have shown some less than good judgement from time to time must be ignored. Or, at least, will be ignored by his supporters.We went from covert action to open troop involvement and warfare in Viet Nam, Grenada, Panama, Iran, Haiti and Iraq, and Iraq again. All of those, with the exception of Viet Nam where our military involvement began covertly under a Republican administration, was greatly expanded and turned into open warfare (and toppling a regime) by Democrats, and then expanded into other countries with air warfare under a Republican, have all been initiated by Republican administrations, Under Bill Clinton we also conducted an air war in Bosnia and maintained a no fly zone  and sanctions against Iraq. Hillary had nothing to do with any of that.Blaming Hillary for circumstances decades, and in some cases centuries, in the making is ridiculous. Worse is the fact that her detractors never poured such vehemence and hatred on the men who shaped these policies. They do not pour such vile hatred on the men who voted for the Iraq War either -- like Joe Biden, who many were anxious to see get into the race to challenge Clinton.Biden not only voted for the war, he WROTE the crime bill that created the many injustices and exploded our incarceration that people are protesting today. The Leftist who are now Sanders supporters hold Clinton accountable for her husband signing that bill even though as First Lady she could do nothing but voice her objections -- which, it has been reported, she did. At the time that bill was called the "Biden bill." Yet I've heard NO attacks on the Vice President for his leading role in that catastrophe.Equally bad, Biden wrote and promoted a domestic security bill. It didn't pass under Clinton, but, as he proudly boasted at the time, was later -- with all its abused of civil liberties -- used to create Bush's Homeland Security legislation. But Biden is extolled as a decent man, and Clinton is reviled and held responsible for things she had nothing to do with.Colin Powell lied to the world to get us into the war in Iraq, but he's not called a war monger. He used a private email system for official government business and destroyed those emails after leaving office. Yet he too is a decent man and has never been accused of doing anything dishonest, and suspiciously secretive, or criminal. Karl Rove when he worked in the White House and Jeb Bush as governor both used private email systems. And Jeb used a private server too. Again, both destroyed all those official documents after leaving office. But no one is investigating them or calling them dishonest and criminal.As for Haiti, the horrid, inhumane policies of George Bush I -- including starving its citizens with an embargo and refusing to accept people who risked their lives to escape the chaos and death -- bequeathed a disastrous and cruel situation and policy  to his successor. But, again, he is talked up in the media as a decent and moderate man. None of the cruelty he imposed on Haiti had ANYTHING to do with Hillary.Bill Clinton inherited Bush's mess. He tried to protect, rather than destroy, its democratically elected administration, lifted the embargo that was starving the people, and reversed Bush's policy on turning back those fleeing the violence and disorder. Here is a link to a good, clear account of what happened to Haiti in the Bush I and Clinton era:http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw...Bush II and Cheney were an even worse disaster for Haiti. But, again, none of that had anything to do with Hillary Clinton.Your conspiracy theories about the Clinton Foundation and its work there are partisan fantasies. And the notion that Hillary was given $10 million for a coup in Ukraine is nuts. She does not personally profit from the foundation. You are free to disapprove of what it does.We've been bombing countries to protect "American interests" for the last 70 years. If you didn't know that really means "corporate profits" shame on you. As Secretary of State it was Clinton's  job to promote the President's policies, not her own. And to advise him based in her agencies knowledge of the conditions in rapidly changing and conflicted parts of the world. I don't think that Obama's policies have been especially wise in all cases, but I also don't think that there is much we can do about the chaos in the Mideast and Africa. There are long standing and complex reasons for that chaos that include bitter disputes and schisms within Islam and the painful clash between traditional ways of being, believing and living and exposure to and exploitation by Western values and economics. Plus long term drought and bitter disputes over dwindling and changing natural resources.Hillary is not a neo-liberal -- in foreign policy she is from the  "talk tough but seek a diplomatic solution" school. She is respected by world leaders and has a deep understanding of the conditions that prevail. Any president will be faced with the terrible circumstances that are creating so much violence in the world today -- and worse as climate change displaces millions of people, creates epidemics caused by new exposure to diseases once found only in other regions, and conflicts over water. There is nothing in Bernie Sanders record that demonstrates he is knowledgeable and prepare to respond.This is very long. But if you honestly want to talk about real candidates and office holders and foreign policy actions and the state of a troubled world, it takes time. Making ill-informed judgements that dismiss recent history and pushing partisan conspiracy theories, while personally denigrating a political figure, takes no time at all. </comment>

<comment>>That's the Hillary Doctrine; the basis of our foreign policy.The basis of her foreign policy is bombs away for Murica, just like everyone else who came out of '90s DC. She's publicly committed to starting not one, not two, but three wars, you know. And one of them has a real good chance of killing everyone.</comment>

<comment>will i stand up for mi abuela hillary? not unless someone picks me up.</comment>

<comment>What they'll do is continue to advocate for bigger, more intrusive government.  More taxes, more regulation, less freedom.</comment>

<comment>Considering the alternative? Absolutely.</comment>

<comment>I like Clinton and Bernie, but I'm more likely to support Hillary because of general election issues.  Bernie has some great ideas and I'm happy he has pushed Hillary further left during the primary season but I don't think Bernie is electable.  Who knows though, he could be an Obama surprise and I'd be happy to support him as well.  I voted for John Edwards in 2008, he came in third in Florida.  Hillary first, Obama second.  Shortly thereafter he suspended his campaign and then all the affair stuff came out.  So who knows what will happen this time around.</comment>

<comment>Hopefully women will support Bernie Sanders as Clinton's star fades to black.</comment>

<comment>What kind of weak-minded fool voluntarily gives her own money to Hillary Clinton? Might as well give it to a televangelist.</comment>

<comment>She's a corrupt, dissembling, Nixonian plutocrat, but.......She has ovaries!!!!So yay!!!</comment>

<comment>"Friday White Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters some officials at the FBI have said Hillary Clinton is not a target of the current investigation.That statement by Josh Earnest has got the back up of our contacts at the FBI and Justice Department for two reasons…  They are SUPER PISSED OFF to use a technical term.  Number one, Josh Earnest has absolutely no clearance or visibility in the FBI investigation. Number two, they say it really seems part of a troubling pattern from the White House because the president earlier said he did not see any national security implications to the Clinton emails and then we found out he had never been briefed."http://www.thegatewaypundit.co...</comment>

<comment>It says a lot when I still consider her better than the Democratic alternative which is why once again I'll be voting in the Democratic primary to get her as a lesser of two evils.</comment>

<comment>Don't vote. Stay home, pamper yourself. </comment>

<comment>I'll have more money to do that if I can prevent Bernie from getting elected and raising my taxes for services I don't want or need.</comment>

<comment>Silly, it's not ovaries they are voting for! It's the sexual identification as female! We need Sanders to come out as trans!</comment>

<comment>"The gender breakdown of Clinton’s donors indicates that women can be harnessed as a powerful force in a part of the political process where they’ve historically been underrepresented."Sure women can be involved!~50% of pro-life supports are female FYI.</comment>

<comment>Let's be real, and call them anti-choice supporters. That also should,be qualified by saying that 50% of said anti-choice supporters make up what percentage of the voting age population?That's like acknowledging Obama won a landslide victory in 2012 without acknowledging that 63% of eligible voters did not vote.</comment>

<comment>Listen everyone, I think these criticisms of Hillary are unfair.She got her daughter, Chelsea, a $600k a year job "working" for NBC.She set her son-in-law up at a hedge fund, and he makes millions of bucks a year managing the money of Clinton friends!If she's this good at getting people good jobs, think about what she could do for everyone if she was President!!</comment>

<comment>Maybe she could make you Czar of womansplaining</comment>

<comment>Vote for Hillary!She has ovaries!Her husband is an a$$hole!She's the everywoman!  She's just like you!!  She even keeps top secret data on a server in her bathroom!!!</comment>

<comment>It's true! We will all have wonderful, high-paying jobs when Hillary is president. Because she will be the president of Everyday People. Single girls.... Don't despair. There's a hedge-fund manager out there for you too!</comment>

<comment>Aside from voting for "one of their own (a woman)" it is unfathomable that women would vote for Hillary given her record of mistreatment of women.</comment>

<comment>Except women don't vote based on records or facts.  They vote based on how they feel about the candidate.</comment>

<comment>i look forward to the day a woman runs for president and her values represent my own.</comment>

<comment>Not Carly, I assume.</comment>

<comment>gag. definitely  not.</comment>

<comment>Theres one "dude" in that picture.He looks like he might get shipped home in a drum.</comment>

<comment>Chelsea had to come out something...or...Oh god, they are pod people aren't they?</comment>

<comment>How about the women Hillary your husband has raped. You tried to silence their voices. That shows that women are to be disrespected and are worthless and if you are a white man raping women is great and you can rape women and make it to the white house -- twice. But if you are an immigrant and you rape a women you get deported. So Hillary is also a big fan of apartheid. Different set of rules for her than others. Hillary is morally bankrupt.</comment>

<comment>What's most impressive are the record numbers of first time women contributors to Sanders campaign, which is largely younger generation. If they stay engaged, that demographic more than any other can change the landscape</comment>

<comment>What happens if Sanders becomes president? Will he be turning on members of the Democratic party that don't agree with his radical ideaa to be challenged in the election. Nancy Pelosi distanced herself and the Democratic party from Sanders this past week.</comment>

<comment>Gee, I wonder why Pelosi distanced herself from Sanders? DIdn't have anything to do with her being a pal of Clinton's, right?</comment>

<comment>No he won't. He has to work with what the [Republic Party] Congress gives him.</comment>

<comment>calm down. tell me what exactly is so "radical" about a democrat who supports single payer and breaking up the too big to fail banks? I believe the Democratic party became the party of the people because of... get ready for it... Franklin Roosevelt. yes. Sanders cann certainly bring in the 63% of voters who stayed home in 2012.  and most voters, let alone those 63% don't really care what Nancy Pelosi thinks. really. I caucused for Hillary in 08' and i spent 8 years active in the California party.   we really need to let go of policng the "tree house" and let democracy happen.So, what Democrat worth voting for is going to reject that platform, and those enthusiastic voters? and what abotu Sanders makes you think he's going to "punish" elected democrats? the peopel are the ones doing the punishing, and that's been going on awhile. </comment>

<comment>$3.5 Trillion of our economy is spent on healthcare. That's our entire federal budget right there. In order to not have a deficit, you'll have to double the amount of taxes that everyone pays in order to make a single payer system work in the US. Is that realistic? Nope. (Double is an exaggeration as we are spending federally $928 billion this fiscal year.)Breaking up the banks should've happened on its own when we should not have bailed them out in the first place. Think about how much was wasted paying CEO's bonuses and not to mention not punishing failure.The Democrats barely passed Obamacare and are the majority of Democrats in Congress don't support Sanders. So, yes. He'll need to campaign against certain members of Congress of his own party.</comment>

<comment>and where do you draw those figures from? the reality has been written about all over the place: Bernie's proposal would SAVE every person thousands, with a small tax increase. and a higher taxes on the top one-tenth of 1 percent!in the 50's under a Eisenhower,a Republican, the wealthy were paying a higher tax percentage than they will under Bernie.and as far as the banks go: breaking them up didn't happen. why? because Goldman Sachs runs the treasury department, and the political establishment is wrapped up tightly with the whole financial establishment. Remember Dodd-Frank, the highly unsuccessful stop-gap? both Chris Dodd and Barney Frank are working for them now.</comment>

<comment>I'm worried the concept of citizenship defined as a political stand will ultimately break down to an identity—political identity—based one, where women, homosexuals or Blacks are expected to vote in a certain way, like they don't have anything more defining than features they were born with. It's frightening.</comment>

<comment>We have a system that is not kind to ideologues. It was conceived with the assumption that people will pursue their own interests, and designed to, hopefully, by keeping any one faction or interest from grabbing everything it wants, encourage diverse interests to decide to work and compromise with each other in the hope of getting some of what they want and need, and in order to serve the greater, common good.Much of what people dismiss as "identity politics" or "special interests" are just people trying to pursue what they see as their best interest -- just as the founders expected them to do.But, we are no longer as pragmatic as our founders. We think demanding ideological consistency is a more moral and purer way to conduct our politics.Trouble with that is that it encourages us to feel morally superior and more "right" than our competitors in the political arena. And it discourages us from trying to see important issues through from the perspective of, and through the pragmatic reality, circumstances and best interests of our opponents. The ideological have no interest in learning anything from or about those who don't embrace their ideology, don't respect others circumstances, and are not able or desirous of making accommodations with, and move ahead together with, people other than those who share their ideological purity. The don't need to know anything except their limited and unreal ideological world view.Women, minorities, business interests, workers, religious groups, non-religious groups, gays, teachers and other public employees, farmers,financial interests, investors, etc, etc,who ask to have their interests represented in the political arena are doing exactly what the founders expected self-governing people to do.Expecting pragmatic representation for your "special interests" (we all have and are "special interests) in the political conversation is not the frightening thing.The ideologues who refuse to recognize and respect the reality of this diversity of interests and perspectives, and the need to work together, with respect, to come up with pragmatic solutions that serve the common interest, are what is frightening.Their insistence that no interests other than their own are valid, and that the justification for expecting to get everything they want politically without respectfully recognizing the rights and interests of others, and working with them to find compromises that take into consideration other people's interests too is a recipe for gridlock -- and, eventually, tyranny.Tyrants, of course, always justifying their supposed right to deny the legitimate rights of others based in their superior ideology.But ideology is in fact bunk. And the basis of every death dealing tyranny in the world.Pol Pot was an ideologue. Stalin was an ideologue. Hitler was an ideologue. They killed millions in the service of their unreal ideologies.</comment>

<comment>It's about time women started putting in the time, effort, and money to help themselves in politics by running more women for office and donating more money to women candidates, instead of just the whining from feminists that more political offices should just be given to women to balance out the political office gender disparity. Now maybe they will start to invest more of their money in women led business startups as well, instead of just feminists whining that women led business startups should just be given more money.</comment>

<comment>Upper income, white women are Clinton's base and will be the most likely demographic to contribute to her campaign.  I think the only "progress" we will see from a Clinton Administration is pressure on large investment banks and big law firms to make more women partners at those firms.  Women making $15 per hour will not have as much support and will be out of luck.</comment>

<comment>You don't know anything about Hillary's lifetime of work on issues that are most important to the well being and survival of working women, men and families do you? You should try to find some non-partisan sources.She was the force behind the creation of the Family Leave bill -- the first bill signed by Bill Clinton as president. That bill wasn't needed by elite women in elite jobs, It was needed by working class and hourly wage workers. She is still focused on that issue today and improving and expanding family leave so it better meets the needs of working women today is part of her platform. She has always fought for affordable health are and child care, and after the powerful insurance lobby defeated the universal health care bill she advocated, she worked hard, and successfully, to get legislation that would provide much need government supported medical coverage for the children of working class families -- families that were the most likely to not get health insurance from their employers or, if they did, were likely to only be offered insurance that covered them alone -- and not their dependents. Or, insurance that made dependent insurance so expensive that it wasn't affordable to cover the whole family.She worked, as First Lady in Arkansas to successfully expand health care access to the many people in poor rural, working class communities that had no health care providers in their communities and had to travel long distances to get even the most basic care.She has always fought for affordable reproductive health care. An issue of vital importance to working women and their families. She's fought for resources for women seeking to open a business. Most important, she's fought for economic equity for working women. She understands, as Bernie doesn't quite, that the lower wages paid for important jobs, mostly in the service area, that are done primarily by women is a big problem and a big contributor to income inequality in an economy in which more job creation and growth is in the low paying service sector than elsewhere.As a woman, a working class woman who, without the resources of an elite education and family connections that more affluent men and women depend on, made a success in business and broke a lot of barriers, I can't think of one policy Sanders has really fought for and stuck his neck out on, that improved my life.It's absurd, given her record, to think she would block efforts to raise working class wages.But, the fight for better wages and requires activism by workers  -- you can't expect to have the political power that organized labor once gave working people if you don't organize. Politicians can support that effort, but they can't replace the need for workers to confront conditions in the workplace and make demands for bargaining power in the workplace.Nothing in Clinton's record or proposals shows anything but support for working women. She understands and respects the work they do -- both in the workplace AND in their families -- and knows how vital their contribution to the economy and their families is.</comment>

<comment>When you vote for bills to direct more money to the ruling plutocracy, you are not voting for working people of any gender.</comment>

<comment>Well, as the daughter of a union organizer who organized workers in Chicago during the Great Depression when company goons made it a dangerous thing to do, I have only one thing to say -- if you are looking to politicians to make workers problems and income inequality magically disappear, it's never going to happen. They only have the power to do the kind of things Hillary has done, and they have to make compromises and deals with people who represent other, often conflicting, interests.And right now plutocrats have the upper hand in terms of representation for their interests because working people stopped organizing to protect their own interests decades ago.I see working people diss unions in forums like this all the time. I know that, starting with the boomers, younger generations, even if they were in a union, stopped showing up for important union elections and started resenting dues. Of course they blamed the unions for not "doing anything" for them but didn't understand that a union is an organization that requires not only your dues but your active participation.If they don't organize workers don't have a voice or power in the political conversation. If they do, their vote becomes much more powerful and effective.If people spent as much time working with others to get the wages and other things they need from the workplace as they do playing the lottery they'd be a long ways toward being heard and having their issues addressed.The plutocrats didn't win in the political world just because of money, they won because workers didn't organize to challenge them. Plutocrats have always had, and will always have, the money advantage. Workers have the power of numbers. IF they work together, collectively, for their best interests.Sure, business has fought hard to eliminate unions and collective bargaining since the Reagan years, but workers just didn't fight back. They voted for tax cuts over wage increases and cowered before their bosses.And as new industries, like high tech, and newly powerful service industries that were never organized became the dominant employers, and made things like contingency workers and just in time hours that didn't provide regular schedules or allow for enough hours and pay to live on routine, they didn't step up and say this is unworkable, we have demands.The movement that's needed isn't voting for a 74 year old mid-20th century liberal whose ideas aren't workable in the economy we have now. The movement that is needed is one that emanates from workers, in the workplace, and that's based in new ideas to address 21st century workplace issues, and in the power of a committed mass movement. But that takes work. And it means taking risks. And it takes time.It's just starting, but workers dug themselves into a big hole by not being activists for themselves over several decades -- it's going to take awhile to get out of that hole and really start making employers -- not politicians -- listen. Politicians are the last step -- they are useless if workers don't vote and don't get involved and haven't been hammering successfully for change in the workplace. You've got to make the plutocrats fear your power.The affluent young college students excited about Bernie now will feel like revolutionaries for a little while, then they will graduate and step into jobs that put them into the top 10%, or 5%, or, if they are really unlucky, the top 20% of earners. And they will forget about the working class entirely.</comment>

<comment>The actions to which you refer happened many years ago.  She is not the same person and her priorities have changed.  What has she done for working class women in the last 15 years?  Her focus now is on obtaining power.</comment>

<comment>She has worked and spoken out consistently  on  these issues in every context. And not only for working women in the United States. She worked on issues supportive of women and children as a young activist and lawyer. As the First lady of Arkansas. As the First Lady of the US. As a Senator from New York. As a supporter of the many Clinton Foundation programs devoted to the problems of working woman here and internationally. As a candidate running for the Presidential nomination in 2008. As Secretary of State. And now, once again, as a Presidential candidate.Every one of those positions have required different and often broader approaches to those issues. She hasn't always been in a position to legislate, and the increasingly conservative domination in which she last worked in a legislating body, plus the reluctance of members of her own party to put controversial "women's issue" front and center hasn't made much progress possible. But she worked on those issues nonetheless.Look, Hillary's speech, "Woman's Rights are Human Rights" delivered before an international body in 1995 is a classic of profoundly inspirational rhetoric that reveals her core beliefs. It is as relevant and powerful today as it was 20 years ago. If you can't read or hear that speech without at least grudgingly understanding who she is and the kind of woman she is at her core, it is probably only because you think women and these very basic HUMAN issues and rights are not important to you and your life. But there are millions of people, men and women, who see it very differently.Give it a try: http://www.americanrhetoric.co...This is a good human. a good person, who has been terribly maligned for political reasons.</comment>

<comment>So you can't point to anything specific other than speeches?  Do you understand, based on the words you use here, that you sounds like someone on her payroll?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure all those fucking illegal alien women will be right there voting for you dear Hilary 👱 Sorry but illegal immigrants don't vote and even the legal ones could give a shit about you or our country. Get a clue people American is getting closer to going 3nd world 👲</comment>

<comment>The old twat will be in prison.</comment>

<comment>Further evidence that women should have no place in politics?</comment>

<comment>History makes clear that men in politics only cause trouble and lots of it.</comment>

<comment>First of all, this article is triggering and offensive to transgender people who do not identify by the rigid two-gender paradigm, and that makes Hillary a hateful bigot. Secondly, A safe bet is that Bernie Sanders is packing roughly the same shaped junk that I am - therefore I demand that The Atlantic publish an article extolling the virtues I clearly possess, in how I plan to support candidates with similar shaped junk to my own. Failure to at least do what I have suggested, will be a clear example of a double standard on the part of the Atlantic. </comment>

<comment>Most men have never voted for anyone without similarly shaped junk, and certainly have never voted for anyone with different junk for president.Now they are all bent out of shape because for the first time in our history they - and women who make up a slim majority of voters - will have a chance to choose between people who don't share the same shaped junk for President. And they are afraid that, just like they've been doing since the country's founding, when finally given a choice, women, just like men always have, will prefer the candidate with junk like their own.But don't worry -- the junk you can vote for will now be the voters' choice. Not, like in the past when only one type of junk had any chance of getting a major party's support and nomination, a compulsory precondition forced on you by the establishment.</comment>

<comment>If Hillary came out of the closet she might get some of those males votes.....Some guys really love the lesbian thing.</comment>

<comment>Who cares.</comment>

<comment>Why would anyone vote for Hillary?  She is in favor of killing babies.</comment>

<comment>That is so ridiculous. Hillary is for a woman's right to choose as are many other women out there. What gives any politician or religious leader the right to tell any one woman what she should and shouldn't do with their own body? All some think about is abortion and that's something that is hard decision for any woman to make but a decision for her alone and certainly not any man! Where were all these pro-life groups and religious leaders when kids like those precious 20 souls in Sandy Hook were snuffed out by a gun man? Didn't see any of them standing outside the NRA headquarters with their sign saying lives matter! Pro-life people seem to pick and choose what lives really do matter. For them apparently the unborn are far more important than those in the here and now that is so hypocritical.</comment>

<comment>She is for women's rights unless of course her Husband forced the women to have sex and then she was abuser number one.</comment>

<comment>Bill forced women to have sex! You know this how exactly? Were you there? Other politicians (GOP) have had affairs left right and center even dalliances with men so people shouldn't be so quick to judge Bill.  What Bill did was years ago and newsflash he isn't running for president. It seems some think he is as all the focus is on his past. It is so ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Did Hillary or did she not go after women who had issues with Bill?  We both know the answer but only you are willing to condone her strong handed tactics.</comment>

<comment>Bill was her husband so of course she defended him as any wife would have done.  At the end of the day it is not Bill who is running it is Hillary so Bill's past is old news and time for people to move on.</comment>

<comment>No..No...No....Attacking women who claimed abuse by Bill is Hillary's past.  Standing by your abuser husband is not an acceptable excuse.  Honestly, I'm a little surprised to see so many women like yourself who are willing to drop their principles they way they do for Hillary.  Liberals really need to check themselves when it comes to their support of Hillary.</comment>

<comment>So is it O.K. for Republican women to stand by their men who have transgressed and there have been quite a few of them? Or are we only talking about Hillary because she's a Democrat? To use your own words maybe conservatives need to check themselves when it comes to supporting men who have had affairs, gone with prostitutes and even had dalliances with men!</comment>

<comment>No....It is not.   Get the chip off your shoulder.  Would you tell your daughters that it is ok for their husband or boyfriend to cheat around?  I don't know about you, but I didn't raise my daughters to be a door mat for some POS who does not treat them the way they should be treated.Just to be clear.....I became an Independent for one very good reason.....I never wanted to feel compelled to defend people who did stupid things and are dishonest and basically full of BS.  You are defending complete BS.</comment>

<comment>I'm not defending anyone. I'm just saying Hillary Clinton only did what a lot of other wives would have done or have done. Whether it was right or wrong it was her decision to make just like it is for any wife to make. It's not up to me and certainly not you.</comment>

<comment>If abusing women, and that is what both of them did, is not a big deal to you, then support Hillary.</comment>

<comment>How did Hillary abuse women? Not sure what you meant by saying 'both of them' quite frankly. If you meant by her being loyal to her husband that is not abuse that is a wife defending her husband. I'm not talking about what I would do here I'm just saying that is what Hillary did whether right or wrong as a loyal wife.</comment>

<comment>Standing by your man, and destroying the credibility of another person to help save his political career and to protect your own future political career, is abuse.  Hillary went after Bills victims with full force.  That is what you supporting.</comment>

<comment>I'm supporting a woman who is fully qualified for the job as POTUS. What happened 20 years ago with her husbands infidelity has nothing to do with today and her run for POTUS. Like I said she as a wife supported him whether it was right or wrong in the eyes of others that was her decision to make.  You can't hold her responsible for the actions of her husband all those years ago it is time to move on from that old old story.</comment>

<comment>What happened 20 years ago....How about what happened during her time as Sec of State.   Good God....Could you screw up in the Middle East any worse?  It is hard to believe that any administration could have left the place any worse than Bush, but this Administration proved it could be done.Your supporting a woman......I understand the bias.   Women have made a huge investment in Hillary and now your stuck defending a woman that is pretty bad news and ever worse, nothing but a professional politician.    I really do hope women do well and I wish I had one in my area to vote for, but unfortunately, the old guys have it locked up and the same ones that have screwed things up for years.  I wish I could vote for the Dem lady from Hawaii, but I don't live in Hawaii.   There are some really good strong women coming up and God knows, given the track record of the guys, they deserve a chance.</comment>

<comment>Sort of like the pro-choice people pick and choose which choices really matter.  The only choice they are in favor of is the choice to kill babies.</comment>

<comment>Nope. That would be infanticide and she's never spoken in favor of that.</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton is someone I knew well in my youth.  I made the peace between her and her estranged mother-in-law-to-be, Virginia.  She's one of the finest people I've ever worked with in my life.  She's decent, a Church Lady.  Her morals were outstanding and she is the most natural leader of people, and she is a great hero.  Yes, hero.  Sure, she used to march and bounce around like the character, Princess Leah Organa of Aulderan, her father had been a drill sergeant so we cut her some slack.  But it was also the glint in her eye, the steely determination of her soul, and the intensity of her inspiration that led to Quantitative Easing that saved our economy from being swallowed by the deflation of the republican Great Recession, that set the date for the Berlin Wall to fall, that sparked the legal assault against Big Tobacco that has saved so many lives.  Hillary conceived, drafted, and shepherded the Family Leave Act, the first law her husband ever signed as president.  That was just getting started.  Hillary inspired Ann Richards and the Deadbeat Dad Laws of Arkansas, Texas, and Georgia.  If she sounds "elitist" to you, I'm sorry.  If you feel you must reproach me, call me names here in public, then I fear for your soul.</comment>

<comment>Sadly the Hillary haters will be out in full force. Some seem to overlook her record as being a fighter but concentrate more on her husband and his transgressions as if it is Bill who is running not Hillary. I like you feel Hillary is the most qualified out there to be the next POTUS and I'm sure she will be the nominee. I also feel that some just don't want to see a woman as president even though Hillary is as smart as a whip there still exists that sexist side of things. Those doubters out there of having the first woman president better get prepared as they are about to see it happen in November.</comment>

<comment>Oh, and she helped the rich get richer. The Church of the Almighty Dollar. Go Plutocrats!! Go Hillary!!</comment>

<comment>Well off people did accumulate fabulous fortunes while Hillary Clinton was co-president in the White House, but the gap between rich and poor narrowed if only slightly.</comment>

<comment>Hillary simply cannot tell the truth. Here's her scorecard:Admitted Lies— Chelsea was jogging around the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001. (She was in bed watching it on TV.)— Hillary was named after Sir Edmund Hillary. (She admitted she was wrong. He climbed Mt. Everest five years after her birth.)— She was under sniper fire in Bosnia. (A girl presented her with flowers at the foot of the ramp.)— She learned in The Wall Street Journal how to make a killing in the futures market. (It didn't cover the market back then.)Whoppers She Won't Confess To— She didn't know about the pardons of members of the violent Puerto Rico nationalist group FALN.— She didn't know that her brothers were being paid to get pardons that Clinton granted.— Taking the White House gifts was a clerical error.— She didn't know that her staff would fire the travel office staff after she told them to do so.— She didn't know that the Peter Paul fund-raiser in Hollywood in 2000 cost $700,000 more than she reported it had.— She opposed NAFTA at the time.— She was instrumental in the Irish peace process.— She urged Bill to intervene in Rwanda.— She played a role in the '90s economic recovery.— The Rose Law Firm billing records showed up on their own.— She thought Bill was innocent when the Monica scandal broke.— She was always a Yankees fan.— She had nothing to do with the New Square Hasidic pardons (after they voted for her 1,400 to 12 and she attended a meeting at the White House about the pardons).— She negotiated for the release of refugees in Macedonia (who were released the day before she got there).</comment>

<comment>The Plumbers are an organization of Cubans and a few crazy CIA John Birtchers who use drugs for political power.  It all started when Barbara "Bar" Bush had a child out of wedlock with Jack Kennedy during WWII.  Poppy Bush (who'd introduced them) stepped in to marry her in January of 1945, so George W. Bush  is actually a year older than he admits.  The JFK assassination by George H.W. Bush and his Plumbers "Secret Team" Death Squad was driven by that cuckoldry.  It's what drove Bush to urge Nixon's order.  Thereafter, the "Secret Team" used enflurane to drug assassins and witnesses while George W. Bush used enflurane to drug rape hundreds of pretty young girls in north Dallas, Farmers Branch, Richardson, Carrolton, and in Houston, Texas.  Bush et al drug-assassinated MLK, RFK, George Wallace, LBJ (whose body still glows from the radiation), Vince Foster, John Lennon, basically anybody in first Nixon's then Bush's way.  The drug has been particularly useful in obtaining "campaign contributions", evidence the well financed failing campaigns of unpopular Cruz, Rubio, and Bush.George H.W. Bush and Barbara Bush privately "interviewed" every member of the White House Staff who stayed for the Clinton administration, drugging every last one of them with enflurane, so the Bushes & their Plumbers kept free and unfettered access to the entire White House complex.  Rubio, Cruz, and Johnny E. Bush (J.E.B.!) are favorite sons of the group of 5 families who were represented at various assassinations and break-ins.  Rubio has maintained a leadership role.  Johnny committed no crimes for the gang in his youth and likely still has not.  JEB's crimes are those of omission, failing to effectively report his family's treason.  All of the "admitted lies" you made up have been explained, it's the explanations you find unreasonable.  How could a release be negotiated before you got there?  Telephones, big mystery.  Hillary attended ALL the meetings, she was co-president in the Clinton White House.  I know personally that she was an obnoxious Yankees Baseball Team fanatic when she was 24, that would be 1972, and from the childish expressions on her face at the time she put that NYY baseball hat on, she'd been a fan for many years beginning in childhood.  Everybody thought Bill was innocent, turns out he did what he did  for Gingrich, who sent Lewinsky and facilitated everything.  The Rose Law Firm billings (proving her innocence of many charges) were placed by the Plumbers, who'd stolen them from Rose in the first place.  Hillary attended ALL meetings, she was co-president in the Clinton White House, so yes, she did influence Clinton economic policy and the result was the greatest economic improvement in history up to that time.  Rwanda, Ireland, NAFTA (she was wrong to oppose it), she was present at ALL meetings.  I know hard to believe, huh?  You don't know Hillary!  The Travel Office staff was full of drugged hold-over spies from the immediately preceding Bush administration.  Sniper fire in Bosnia.  Technically, her plane was under sniper fire, that's why their descent to the airport was so steep, which is what she reported and which you deliberately distort.  Hillary was told by her father that she was named for Sir Edmund, which she reported accurately.  So, he told his little girl a fib, big deal.  So, all this minutia and these are the "lies" you come up with?  I knew Hillary well, and she's not a liar at all.  Indeed, she was a Church Lady!  Long white cotton gloves, personalized white leather Bible, Church every Sunday.  I think you just wasted a billion dollars investigating a Church Lady for 20 years and seethe that she's been voted Most Admired Woman each of the last 20 years despite all your attempts to slander her.I recommend that you read a Bible and forget about politics.  Slandering people you don't even know will just earn you a ticket to fire.  Satan's name in Hebrew means "Slanderer".  Narrow & straight are way & gate, and it's easier to get a hawser through the eye of a needle than it is to get a wealth-obsessed republican into the Kingdom of Heaven.</comment>

<comment>Ok.....crazy person alert!!</comment>

<comment>Slander like that gives you a ticket to eternal fire.  (The Hebrews don't call Satan "Slanderer" for nothing. )  You must ask God with a contrite heart to forgive you and promise not to do it again.  Sure it's easy to slander anybody, but we must restrain ourselves.  If it were easy to murder people online you wouldn't do that, would you?  Slandering strangers is a crime, just like murder.</comment>

<comment>Well women make up more than half of the population, so yes, women have the potential to do virtually anything politically.  I'm not sure what the "news" aspect of this is.  It's like writing an article stating that Hispanic or Caucasian voters have the ability to completely change the political landscape.  Well, yes.  If you could capture all or most of a large demographic, you could do very well politically.  The trick isn't recognizing that there are a lot of X, it's convincing a lot of X (who may have a diverse array of priorities and ideas) that you are their best option.</comment>

<comment>It's all about money, not gender.</comment>

<comment>May I suggest that this story misses a Central Point regarding representational democracy.Why should anyone have to "support financially" a candidate? Which is (or should be) a key-issue of this election. We have seen how two factors historically have decided campaign outcomes. The first is "gerrymandering" (since 1813) and the second is "vested-interest financing" of campaigns.Both have ruined the process-of-democracy in America, and we should be correcting their worst influences.Why are they not "key" campaign issues? Because the candidates dare not touch them with a ten foot pole in an election year.We really need the means to conduct (easily) national referendums - because representational democracy has reached its limits in the US ...</comment>
