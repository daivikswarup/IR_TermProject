<comment>The cop was innocent, yet the lawsuits continuedI can't fix stupid for you</comment>

<comment>What does that have to do with the DOJ investigation that proved civil rights abuses?</comment>

<comment>Actually they didn't prove any civil rights abuses.  If they did a cop would have gone to prisonThey proved that black people commit more crime in the city of St Louis..but we knew that already</comment>

<comment>You missed the DOJ report on the Ferguson Police Department. Go look it up. It doesn't have much to do with Mike Brown.</comment>

<comment>You are the only racist here</comment>

<comment>Good one. How so?</comment>

<comment>Isn't Ferguson the place where that idiot cop decided to not wait for backup while in pursuit of the huge fellow that had just abused a store owner and stole some slives ?</comment>

<comment>That's kinda what I was getting at.  We only seem to disagree in how the cop handled his business.</comment>

<comment>Your mindset is horrible.  You are human excrement, racist.</comment>

<comment>Sounds pretty accurate to me....</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the racist, inaccurate account of what happened.</comment>

<comment>That depends on where you want to start looking at it.  When Wilson either decided to abandon common sense and police training to back his car up on top of two men he thought had recently committed a robbery, or (more accurate, imo) he became enraged at Brown and decided his ego needed for him to direct confront him.In either case, Wilson exhibited poor judgement and recklessly created the circumstances which led to Brown's death.But, as is typical, the matter was "investigated" only in such a way as to produce the desired conclusion.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>In his grand jury testimony he claimed he reversed his car back to the two men because he saw they matched the description of the robbery suspects.Which call, I should add, he claimed he didn't really listen to.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>No mention of a robbery...</comment>

<comment>Page 208.  He gives his version of the "get out of the roadway" spiel and then says he saw the cigarillos and then Johnson's black shirt and thought they were the two from the "stealing."He then says he called in for backup and then reversed his patrol car to cut them off.https://www.documentcloud.org/...His account at the grand jury wasn't consistent with what his Sergeant testified he told him on the ride back to the precinct.The shooting might have been justified.  It might not have been.  I don't think the investigation was credible given that they let Wilson hold onto his equipment belt and wash his hands before even checking him.  The bruises in the pictures shown to the grand jury are solely on the right side of his face, moreover.  Add to that McCulloch admitting he put at least one witness on the stand he know was going to commit perjury and he misrepresented the law to the grand jury about when police may use deadly force, and there's nothing credible in the process.So perhaps the shooting was justified.  Perhaps the actions of the Ferguson PD, the St. Louis County PD, McCulloch and his office, and including the FBI all amount to a shoddy investigation that will leave a shadow hanging over an innocent man.  We'll never really know.</comment>

<comment>There was no call. There was no robbery investigation. Nobody from the store called the police. The Ferguson Police Department, ignoring requests by the DOJ not to release the footage from the convenience store, released it to make Brown out as a violent criminal.</comment>

<comment>According to the attorney for the store a customer called in the alleged robbery.  No employee did.  http://www.dailykos.com/story/....The DailyKos title is a touch off.  No *employee* called the police, not "no one."Whether there was a call or not, Wilson testified that he recognized them as matching the description in the call that went out over the police radio.</comment>

<comment>I'll admit, I may have overlooked that. Thank you for correcting me. I'm a little confused though, at one point, the chief of the Ferguson Police Department Tom Jackson said, the video of the incident allegedly showing Brown, which was released to the public, "had nothing to do with the stop" and was "unrelated" to Wilson's contact with Brown". Which one is it? It sounds like someone continually changing the narrative to advance their motives.I hate arguing details like this because people tend to fixate on Mike Brown when discussing Ferguson even though he was merely a catalyst for all the protests and anger. The real issue is the rampant extortion, racial profiling and general civil rights abuses of Ferguson citizens.</comment>

<comment>That's what it seems like to me.  Remember that Missouri is a state with an LEO "BIll of Right," among which is the right to review evidence before making a statement.  Wilson's comments to his Sergeant on the way back to the precinct were made before he could have seen the forensics and other evidence gathered by those processing the crime scene.Later, however, he's seen the evidence and is able to adjust his story to match.  Including his connecting them to the alleged robbery.I agree with you on Brown.  As a focal point, he's a flawed and problematic one.  He probably wasn't the "gentle giant" some were portrarying him, giving those who'd rather dismiss the problems of police misconduct and institutional corruption in our law enforcement and criminal justice institutions a ready excuse to keep their eyes and ears closed.  The case of Henry Davis isn't so easily excused, and is probably more representative of the regular interactions of the poor and mostly black population of Ferguson had with their police force.http://www.thedailybeast.com/a...</comment>

<comment>I just posted the link for that article for someone else. I had heard of the LEO Bill of Right, but I didn't know that that was involved with the Mike Brown deal.I agree that yes, "as a focal point, he's a flawed and problematic one." It's just disconcerting that so many people are okay with the circumstances of his death especially considering the almost undeniable perjury committed by Wilson.A young man is walking down the street with his friend, a cop stops him and he's killed. How could this not have been easily prevented?</comment>

<comment>So he says.  I suspect he lied, and he actually backed up his SUV with the intent of teaching a mouthy Brown a lesson.  Things escalated from there.This is the same police department that beat a man for not being wanted in an arrest warrant and then arrested and charged him with bleeding on their shoes.Any crying from city officials or the police should be treated with contempt.  The reality is the lot of then should be spending decades in a Federal prison, bit none of them face any personal consequences for.their betrayal of the offices of trust they hold.</comment>

<comment>And an exhaustive Federal investigation proves what you suspect to be false.Unless of course Holder was in on it as well.</comment>

<comment>The "exhaustive Federal investigation" was anything but exhaustive, and Holder's record on holding law enforcement accountable for misconduct is woeful.It's not about being "in on it."  It's about being unable to account for one's own biases.  That Wilson lied in his grand jury testimony is apparent to anyone with a brain.  His account of putting himself in a vulnerable position upon recognizing the two as fitting the description of robbery suspects is farcical.  It also ran counter to his earliest statements to his own sergeant.</comment>

<comment>Except again, unless one presupposes that Holder and the Federal investigators and all the witnesses and forensics evidence is in on it and part of some massive cover up you having doubts is meaningless.You are free to doubt, its a free country.But nobody has to believe you.</comment>

<comment>Except, again, one doesn't have to believe there was a conspiracy.  Just bias.McCulloch knowingly put a pro-Wilson witness before the grand jury to commit perjury and he misrepresented the law.  The investigators admitted they approached the case from the assumption that Wilson was the victim.  The Feds piggybacked on the St. Louis County Police investigation instead of taking the lead or conducting an independent investigation.That Wilson lied about what happened also isn't really disputable.  At least, not intelligently disputable.  That's probably why you have to resort to fallacies like an appeal to authority and ad hominem to come up with an argument.  Wilson's actions may not have been criminal, but they were certainly poor judgement and escalated a situation to where deadly force became, perhaps, necessary.  But that he screwed up and later lied about it shouldn't be left out.</comment>

<comment>All law enforcement has people who needlessly escalate situations. It's unfortunate, but not criminal. Generally those with the proverbial "gift of gab" who could talk down situations either go into sales where their income is higher, or aren't physically/mentally suited for policing.</comment>

<comment>And from where I sit, the "bias" lies with the folks still trying to deny the reality of what happened in Ferguson.That the Michel-Brown-as-victim thing was a lie from the get-go.As Holders investigation showed. He was cleared on all charges. Period.That you continue to work so hard to justify your bias says more about what the case has become in your than its reality."poor judgment" is that the criminal Brown showed when he attacked a little elderly man while robbing him. Then later he showed" "poor judgment" in attacking an armed LEO, trying to get his gun then charging him again.Tragic to be sure, but not the LEO's fault, as per the top cop in the USA at the time Eric Holder.</comment>

<comment>When it comes to police misconduct Holder has been a piece of crap his entire career.  http://www.usatoday.com/story/...The "reality of what happened in Ferguson" is there was a biased investigation and a corrupt prosecutor intent on covering up what happened. Anyone who denies is just an useful idiot for the police state.  The kind of unamerican idiots who are ruining this Republic.</comment>

<comment>So Holder is either in on it or  turned a blind eye to it?Sure buddy sure....cause that is so much more likely than a youthful criminal, who was videotaped attacking an elderly man shortly before would attack a cop.......just like the eyewitnesses and forensics say BTW.Of course "they" are also "in on" the plot as well right? Are you a 9/11 Truther as well? ;)And you hang it upon Holder being an active participant in a cover up or simply being uninterested in solving it? Which would be a major blow the Presidents Admin as well BTW.So you disagree with both the Local investigation  AND the Federal one.Which means you think the eyewitnesses and the forensics was somehow doctored as well?In other words you have decided what "reality" is in this case and any evidence or conclusions contrary to that position are "wrong."That my friend is a demonstration of faith not reason.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.  My problem was that Brown was an on camera thug and no longer his mammas little angel as he was depicted by the media so in this particular case...........</comment>

<comment>I don't see that as particularly relevant.If you were to learn something horrible about Wilson, would that make you think he was guilty?</comment>

<comment>He was guilty.  He didn't wait for backup and big thuggy went after him.</comment>

<comment>Except the store never called police to report a crime... Also, what does that have to do with the DOJ investigation proving widespread civil rights abuses by the Ferguson Police Department.</comment>

<comment>Ferguson.  The city in which bullshat became a thing.  Show me a scenario where the bad cop violates an innocent.  That's all I want to see.</comment>

<comment>Among many others detailed in the DOJ report:"A Missouri man who said he was mistaken for a criminal, beaten by Ferguson cops and charged for bleeding on their uniforms can now continue his lawsuit over the alleged assault — nearly six years after the incident, a court ruled Tuesday."http://www.nydailynews.com/new...</comment>

<comment>Ok.  Peoples rights are violated everyday by some goof.  What makes Ferguson special ?  All of our rights are violated on a National scale by all sorts of dumb stuff. What makes Ferguson special ? Have they rounded up all the looters and fire bugs who violated the people of Ferguson ?</comment>

<comment>READ THE F**KING REPORT!!! Intentionally remaining ignorant is not a good thing. I'm not going to give you a hour-long lecture. Mike Brown was the spark, but the whole situation in Ferguson was only 10% about him. And yes, every looter that they found and arrested I'm sure was prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. For God's sake, read once in a while. The report explains exactly "what makes Ferguson special".</comment>

<comment>I have.  Just jerking your chain because you seem to be on Browns side.  Can't take anyone seriously that thinks he was innocent. Sorry.  I am all for reeling in bad cops.</comment>

<comment>Also, instead of spewing nonsense and heresay. Actually read the report: http://www.justice.gov/sites/d...</comment>

<comment>Nnnnnnnnn O !  I have all my memory in tact from the burning. I'm good.</comment>

<comment>I know you hate to overburdened by reality. As if your total non contextualized words add up to anything other than that.</comment>

<comment>Whatever you say.   The burned the town down over a lie.</comment>

<comment>I would truly like to think this will work, but the municipalities in the St. Louis area have a significant structural problem: St. Louis County contains 90 separate municipal governments. To call this area of one million people ludicrously over-governed puts things mildly: St. Louis County has twice as many mayors as my city has council members, and I live in a city with twice the population of St. Louis County. Paying for this fragmented government must logically make the area economically less competitive than other more efficiently governed metropolitan areas. In an era where business and industry have the ability to relocate, that means the burdens must fall on the residents, specifically and primarily on those residents least able to leave.It seems clear that if the municipalities of St. Louis County do not solve their structural problem, then solutions such as this one will eventually compel them to do so, primarily through a process of bankruptcy followed by forced amalgamation. In all cases it appears that area voters will have two choices: accept the inevitable amalgamations and conduct them in a rational manner, or else cling to the top-heavy and unworkable structure in place, and see it break down while squandering considerable wealth on missed opportunities, legal fees. loan interest, and so on.It's their choice.</comment>

<comment>I totally agree with you here. Great insight. Members of the Missouri legislative like Senator Jamilah Nasheed are working to fix this structural problem. The problem is these dinkey municipalities don't want to incorporate into the county because their mayors, council people, police, etc. have power and are making money (much of it through ridiculous fines and taxes) that they don't want to lose. They're doing so at the expense of their constituents. It's basically legal corruption.The worst thing about it is that most of the municipalities already use county-provided services like trash pick-up, recycling pick-up, policing, fire departments, infrastructure maintenance, etc. Basically, there's no reason for these municipalities to have a local government.</comment>

<comment>The indictment of Ferguson by the DOJ is largely predicated on the claim that black motorists were issued traffic citations with greater frequency than their White counterparts.  Are we really expected to believe that Ferguson Blacks are as attentive to the issues that get one "pulled over" as more affluent Whites?   Things like current registrations and inspections, the condition of lights etc.?   And then, of course, come the dreaded inquiries into outstanding warrants, valid driver's licence, and proof of insurance.  As for the fines collected, they came to a total of about 30% of the municipal budget, hardly sufficient to fund the police department.The case against Ferguson was contrived to divert attention from the fact that the orgy of rioting, looting and arson we witnessed, as spineless politicians refused to intervene, was incited by malicious falsehoods.  These falsehoods live on, under the rubric "Hands Up, Don't Shoot."  Apparently, we are invited to suppose that the statistics demonstrating appalling "inner city" crime rates are the product of a "vast White conspiracy."The disingenuous propaganda being spewed here has long lost credibility.  Almost without exception, the incidents of alleged "police brutality" had their origin in unlawful conduct, or defiance of lawful orders.   This is why Middle America silently applauds, when a certain colorful politician ejects BLM agitators from his rallies.</comment>

<comment>They aren't more attentive.  They aren't less.  They are more likely to be pulled over and cited.During the Fed investigation on this WaPo had an article on one judge who also happened to be a prosecutor in another jurisdiction and also a judge in a third.  He was resigning one of his judgeships over some fairly serious traffic infraction  (o forget which) for which he'd received extremely lenient treatment, especially considering the way in which the system was rigged to fleece money from those caught up in it.  </comment>

<comment>I'd advise you not to argue with racist trolls for the same reason we don't wrestle with pigs: it wastes your time and the pig enjoys it altogether too much. That said, the ludicrous claim that supposed racial inferiority accounts for the problems of governance in the St. Louis area that produced the unrest in Ferguson doesn't take a lot to refute. As I have already pointed out, St. Louis County has a ludicrously top-heavy government: ninety (count 'em)  municipalities, complete with mayors and councils to govern just over a million people. As a result, the guy you answer claims that the City of Ferguson gets 30% of its revenue from fines and that barely funds its police department.Well, I live in Toronto. I'd hardly hold us up as a model for governance, but my city gets well under five percent of its revenue from fines, and spends well under 30% of its tax revenue on the police service. And most Toronto residents would call us over policed.By any sane standard, spending 30% of municipal revenue on the police and raising that revenue from fines imposed on the population makes the municipal structure of St. Louis County pathological and almost certainly unsustainable. You don't need to address racist theories about African Americans to see that.</comment>

<comment>It's a situation that practically compels institutional corruption.  The motive of the police- pushed on them by their higher-ups- is to raise revenue.  That's easier against the poor and other marginalized people.</comment>

Also no witnesses who were actually there corroborated him having his hands up...Also the powder burns on the gunshot wound on his hand... Almost forgot about that.. He must've had his hand on the barrel when Mr. Wilson fired before he ran away and then ran back...</comment>

<comment>$800K is a bargain!  A single wrongful death claim would cost them far more than that.  And given the DOJ's findings, Ferguson is far more vulnerable to such legal action.  It's nothing more than a question of what they'd rather spend their money on: $800K developing and training to good policies and practices, or uncertain $millions on legal defense and court judgments.</comment>

<comment>Would the people of Ferguson be better off if the city was dissolved and they became an unincorporated part of the county?   From what it sounds like, the only municipal service they provide is an abusive police force whose main job is to generate fines to fund itself.</comment>

<comment>Interesting idea.</comment>

<comment>I understand that the financial landscape is much more complex than this, but using census data, it looks like an extra $800,000 for the city of Ferguson would work out to an average of about $4.43 more in taxes per month, per adult resident, or a little over $53 per year. Obviously this is a very simplified bit of math, but still, looking at the plain numbers, it seems, overall, like a fair cost to pay for the kind of urgent reforms they're proposing. That's doubly so if the reforms result in fewer people getting crushed by much larger individual fines in a rigged system.</comment>

<comment>I lived in the greater St. Louis area from 2007-2014, and when I say greater St. Louis, I mean I lived in one of the small municipalities in St. Louis County. There is little mystery about why these towns, villages, municipalities, whatever you want to call them run into financial distress. Every one of these towns like Ferguson, pop. 21000, Breckenridge Hills, pop. 4700, St John, pop.6,500, Overland,pop. 16000, Woodson Terrace, pop. 4000, Edmundson, pop. 840 ALL have a police department, Public Works departments, City Administration staff, Municipal courts, code enforcement staff, and on and on. Look at a map of the county to see that these towns are butted right against each other. It's clear that this redundancy of "services" are driving costs through the roof when a much more economical solution would be to consolidate the entire county into one governmental body, particularly as the real estate values have declined dramatically over the past 10 years. Of course, this is not the cure for a hyper aggressive police force, but if the police were not in the legalized extortion business due to economic hardship, then perhaps policing could return to its proper place.</comment>

<comment>Any plans to address the extremely high crime rate?  You kinda need both things.</comment>

<comment>Ferguson PD is free to continue addressing the extremely high crime rate, though given that there is an extremely high crime rate, it's clear it hasn't address that in many years.That's a frequent complaint of the law-abiding residents of places like Ferguson. They say the police hassles people over minor things, but doesn't do anything about real crime.</comment>

<comment>Maybe if the city of Ferguson found a way to fund itself by levying fines on rapists and armed robbers...</comment>

<comment>I've never seen cops give any serious consideration to crime that might get them hurt or didn't generate immediate revenue unless there was a news crew around.  It's not just in Ferguson.</comment>

<comment>"Less expensive" is not a good reason for violating peoples Constitutional rights.</comment>

<comment>Big Mike Brown went to townTo cage a stash of "blunts"The clerk said "No!" but Mike disdainedTo be deterred by runts.Karma plotted his comeuppanceAs he strode the street, booty in handEgging him to get himselfCrossways with the Man.Oh, somewhere the bros are rollin'And chillin' to their "rap"But Mike is not among themTaking a nice, long nap.</comment>

<comment>maybe they could take the $800k out of police pensions. i think that most people would agree with that...</comment>

<comment>Most of these seem like pretty reasonable policy implementations. There are a few that really seem questionable though.No random warrant checks? I read this as, "Do not show up randomly at the last know addresses of someone in an attempt to catch them". That's part of their responsibility. ---If this means to stop detaining pedestrians to check them, disregard.Also, decline prosecution of ALL charges levied before 01/2014? That seems crazy. So a murderer will get off because of this? Surely it means all misdemeanor "mala prohibita" charges.</comment>

<comment>I interpreted that to mean just infractions  (ie tickets).  Actual crimes are unaffected. </comment>

<comment>As someone from the area, the bigger issue is not the regulations themselves. Rather that it's only to be imposed on Ferguson, as opposed to the many municipalities that have the same issues, sometimes to a worse degree. It actually is unfair for Ferguson and won't do any good because the larger community is not being addressed.</comment>

<comment>Pull the cops out. Set a perimeter. After all the fires go out, bulldoze and start over.</comment>

<comment>From what the world saw Ferguson is a maniac city.Who cares what happens to them after all those Assassins for Hire destroyed the City beyond recognition and killed innocents with hammers.The question is.....how to even begin to police a zoo like that when its inmates support adults they call 'teens' who are crooks as well as try to kill the policeman as Brown did that's trying to stop their hideous behavior.</comment>

<comment>Could have just paid a few police tickets per year. But no. Have to riot and change everything so now they will be bankrupt, raise property taxes to pay for it all and end up with nothing in the end. Be careful what you ask for.</comment>
