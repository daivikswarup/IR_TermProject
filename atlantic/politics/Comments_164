<comment>Falwell and Trump deserve one another.  Whack jobs for Trump; Hillary for President.</comment>

<comment>Let's think ahead. I am serious.If Trump wins the nomination, I seriously doubt that he'll win the presidency. This is of course, opinion, and I could be wrong, but let's look at what all this means...The reason for Trump/Palin/Cruz/etc. is that traditionalist America is very, very disturbed. Very threatened, so much so that they are prepared to turn to a demagogue and to hell with the consequences--and I don't mean the consequences for their perceived political enemies, I mean they don't care if the guy they want to elect is poorly suited to have possession of the nuclear key, that's how enraged they are at the speed with which the culture has changed out from under them.Now these are the people who most pay taxes, mostly obey the laws. They are turds, many of them, but essentially harmless and productive to this point.I think that many could say "That's just tough..." and I agree that this is a valid way to look at it, if one expects total and complete domination, in the sense of a defeated populace after a war--like post war Japan or Germany.But in truth, they'll still be around, and everyone will still have to make some attempt to work cooperatively.Now Middle America is as motivated as I've ever seen it: it is the first exchange of the culture wars, looks like. And if I'm correct, their man will lose.When this happens, what will be the likely result in the ongoing US culture?Me, I don't know. It is interesting to think about, and perhaps even important to get an early handle on some of the possibilities.E.g, will some of the states try harder to go their own way on social issues: gay rights, abortion, etc?</comment>

<comment>You're looking at a government shut down and debt default in Clinton's first year if she beats Trump. Middle America will rebel and tank the US economy in the process. And this time there will be no bailouts and no stimulus.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure that will go well for them.</comment>

<comment>That's the point: the mood of the center of the nation is self-destructive. *That's* what's different this time.That's why Trump is leading in the polls, or close. In any normal circumstance he'd have as much chance as Rush Limbaugh.</comment>

<comment>Twenty-four years ago, Ross Perot got 19% of the vote, despite being flaky. This is not a new impulse in American politics. What is new is that an independent candidate named Donald Trump is doing a hostile takeover of the GOP from inside the party.</comment>

<comment>Believe me, Perot is not nearly as flaky as Trump.There are those who would say that the reason we have the possibility of a Clintonian Dynasty is Perot's bid.But yeah, he's doing a hostile take-over of the GOP. Good comparison.</comment>

<comment>Trump has lived in the public eye for over thirty years now. He doesn't seem particularly flaky. People who have done business with him say he's a lot quieter in meetings, and sticks to his deals. His kids are certainly a credit to him. The adults are working with him; not one trust-fund rehab-special among them.</comment>

<comment>This political positions are certainly flaky.  You can hardly argue that that's not the case.</comment>

<comment>As far as not seeming particularly flaky, this would indeed be in the eye of the beholder.Without getting into details of either candidate's supposed accomplishments/plans/proposals, for now let me express my read on "character"--how the individual comes off in his/her public presentation.Hillary Clinton exudes, to me, a power hunger like I've never yet seen in a public person. This seems like a very, very clear projection to me, and this concerns me.Trump projects an ego that is so inflated that it may blind him to the consequences of his own proposals.On the basis of personality, both, to me, are unacceptable.Contrast this with the 2008 cycle. I liked McCain as a relatively honest individual with at least a heartfelt (as opposed to simulated for public consumption) ethical core. He seemed, however, out of touch in some key areas (his pronouncement in early fall of 2008 that the economy was just fine shook me), and his selection of Palin put into sharp focus an old question: is McCain's judgement sound? And to me, it seemed like no, it's not.So I looked at Obama. I could see in him my old college room mate, by circumstance also black, and this was a sort of emotional blind spot that I work hard to guard against, but failed in this instance.Obama came across as bright, informed, insightful, humble, and above all evenhanded.This would not in itself be enough to get me to vote for him, but the presence of Palin, and the promise of the dawning of a new era of racial understanding and harmony (after all, naive person that I was, it seemed to me that the fact of his election by a broad segment of the US population would encourage disadvantaged blacks to make a greater attempt to take control of their own best interests, since one could no longer say that the cards were ***institutionally*** stacked against them on the basis of race, alone, Shows what I know...) motivated me to vote for Obama in 2008.But as time passed and Obama insulted me, personally (just as Bill Clinton did, years before, when he looked the American public in the eye, on TV, and declared "I did not have sex with that woman, Ms. Lewinski.") by implying that I was "not paying [my] fair share"--as if there was an obvious standard to consult for how much each person should pay. In short, I was screwing everyone else, no ifs, ands or buts.Believe me when I say that if I wanted to screw everyone else, I would put my mind to it and do a much more thorough job than he is accusing me of doing.So this cheerful portrayal was followed by the public denigration of my efforts (“If you’ve got a business — you didn’t build that. Somebody else made that happen.”)  and made me follow the advice of another poster, who artfully said:"I voted for Obama in 2008 to prove to myself that I am not a racist."I did not vote for Obama in 2012 to prove to myself that I am not a masochist."So to me, the personal projection of a candidate is perhaps at least as important as their stated platform.</comment>

<comment>It will hurt 'them' more than it hurts 'us'.</comment>

<comment>I was going to say 'thank you' for your fair-mindedness until you got to "turds" part. You do realize that you are dismissing more than half the country as "turds"?What Middle America wants very much this time around is to WIN. That above all. So far, Trump is looking like a winner -- a modern media-savvy candidate who won't let himself be destroyed by the Democrat-media complex like Romney and McCain were. Add in some promises to look out for the neglected interests of Middle America, and here we are. If you'll notice, Trump is hardly running on social issues at all, but on immigration and jobs.</comment>

<comment>"You do realize that you are dismissing more than half the country as 'turds'"?Yeah, I do, and would add the the remainder are shitheads.I've watched the interviews on Meet the Press. Trump has very good populist instincts. He is vague, but not nearly as evasive as a more traditional candidate--typically he'll not evade an answer, but attempt to disqualify the question as meaningless. This resonates with his constituency more than an evasion.Me, I don't think Trump will do anything for me. But that's fine; I don't really expect any candidate to do anything for me.But it would be nice if they would leave me the f**k alone, and not insult my lifelong efforts for the sake of political gain, as Obama has done.</comment>

<comment>So much for family values.</comment>

<comment>Trump has the nomination wrapped up.</comment>

<comment>Maybe not wrapped up, but I sure wouldn't be putting money on the chances of anyone else at this point. Here's my take:-Cruz's strategy, such as it is/was, was predicated originally on being the 'safer' version of Trump, which is why he never attacked Trump early, so that he'd be in position to absorb Trump's supporters when Trump imploded as all the pundits predicted. Too bad they were wrong, and now he's trying to convince people of that, but he's burned too many bridges with elected figures in the party. Iowa is his best shot, but even if he manages to somehow win (seeming less likely as we get closer to it), he still is on track to lose New Hampshire, South Carolina, etc, at which point he becomes the latest candidate to win Iowa and lose the rest.-None of the rest of the "establishment" candidates have any serious traction. Rubio's only hope now is that he loses a bunch of primaries, and then in theory manages to get wins in more 'moderate' states - states that are all still polling for Trump at present, but more importantly, ignores the fact that by the time it gets there, he'll be seen as a massive loser. The delegate math still says he can hang in there, but it's a very, very long shot, and pretty much relies on those pundits who've been wrong about Trump imploding suddenly becoming right.</comment>

<comment>Just goes to show you how many people on the right use religion as a cover for their other more conservative and mean spirited beliefs.</comment>

<comment>Did Falwell just endorse the separation of church and state?</comment>

<comment>We have a National Church?</comment>

<comment>So all that's left is choosing a running mate, wait.. no one has even voted yet, have they? Doesn't matter, anyone who watches the show knows it will be the son or the daughter.. the nepotiz is strong with that family.</comment>

<comment>Sarah Palin, Jerry Falwell Jr, Joe Arpaio.  Yikes.  Quite the impressive list of endorsers.  It's like all the grotesques and con artists of American public life are drawn to Trump like flies to a bright orange light bulb.  Who's next? George Zimmerman?  Michelle Bachmann? Ted Nugent? David Duke?  This is getting really good now.</comment>

<comment>I'd actually put money on Bachmann and Nugent.</comment>

<comment>Definitely.  I wasn't joking about any of those people.  They are all natural Trump endorsers.  I'm sure Ann Coulter and Pat Buchanan aren't going to be far behind.  I wouldn't even be surprised if Trump reels in the (literally) big fish and gets Limbaugh.</comment>

<comment>Ann Coulter has already appeared at Trump rallies.</comment>

<comment>Rush has already declared that he's fan of Trump.</comment>

<comment>Nugent is already on the record as a Trumper.</comment>

<comment>Trump is doing damage control. His poll numbers moved to Cruz, he enlists Palin. He blows the bible quote at the bible school and boom! He trots out Falwell. If he feels the base slipping away again, there's no telling who will be on the stage with him.</comment>

<comment>I don't think so.  This is not damage control, since Trump clearly believes himself to be untouchable at this point.  It's more like these are people who are liked (and hated) by a lot of the same people who like (and hate) Trump.  A coalition of the aggrieved, if you will.</comment>

<comment>"A coalition of the aggrieved, if you will."I think this is right on the money."The enemy of my enemy is my friend..."</comment>

<comment>It's hardly damage control as the momentum is already with Trump. But Trump very much wants to win Iowa, as winning both Iowa and NH would make him an overwhelming front runner.</comment>

<comment>People are needlessly confused at Falwell's endorsement of Trump, assuming, falsely, that Falwell favored only evangelical Christians as potential candidates. Trump, not being one, would seem to not qualify for Falwell's favor.Wrong. For Falwell's endorsement, all he needed to be was not Jewish.</comment>

<comment>Wonder what Trump promised Falwell.</comment>

<comment>Handjob and some meth.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm a pro-life Catholic who believes we should be nicer to Muslims and immigrants in general.  I have no idea who to vote for and I'll more than likely just sit out November.I'd like to emphasize to anyone who thinks that "If you don't vote, you can't complain": I really am in a douche-vs.-turd situation here.</comment>

<comment>The US will be a better place if all you 'Pope Francis' Catholics step away from the ballot box for a few cycles. Catholic trads are cool though.</comment>

<comment>Ummmm...no, I'll go vote if I want to, thanks.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for not voting.</comment>

<comment>Pope Francis is attempting (it seems all by himself at times) to save Catholicism from pharisees like yourself. Sad that you can't see that.</comment>

<comment>You've got lots of company, at least among the company I keep. I couldn't make a decision in 2000, and so skipped voting for President but voted for my chosen down-ballot candidates. That way I at least showed up at the polls and did some of my civic duty (and, before anybody blames me for the Bush years, I do not live in a swing state).</comment>

<comment>Eh, I hate the "swing vote" blaming game, whether an election or a Supreme Court decision, or even a close sports game.  "You were the guy who cost us that!"  Bullshit--the other batch of people who went the wrong way share in the blame; the close call is just the person closest to the finger you want to point.</comment>

<comment>Well, let us remember that the central tenets of Falwell's brand of religion have nothing to do with belief in Christ and His message and everything to do with being as hateful, authoritarian, and bigoted as possible toward your fellow American man. </comment>

<comment>Rand Paul remains the best option.</comment>

<comment>He's more of a hawk than Trump and not at all viable.</comment>

<comment>"hawk" you say?Any more delusions that you would like to post here?</comment>

<comment>You're right.  He's sane, actually knows what he's talking about, and wants to help people who look different than he does.  He's certainly not viable in this political climate.</comment>

<comment>Falwell is apparently a Biblical scholar on par with Trump if he compares Trump with Jesus. I am quite alarmed at the prospect of the calamity that a Trump presidency portends.</comment>

<comment>"Refused contributions"? What a load of crap Jerry Jr. is handing out. There's a big Donate button on Trump's web site. [Edit: 2 Donate buttons] And The Donald is like Jesus? Here's another Christianist worshipping Mammon.  The students at Liberty University should cast the idolater out.</comment>

<comment>LOL!  You are complaining about SMALL donations to Trump? The same kind of thing Bernie Sanders gets?You should be complaining that BOTH Hillary and Cruz are Goldman-Sachs funded.</comment>

<comment>Trump has repeatedly said he is self funding, which we all knew was bunk. He will also take establishment money for the general, should he get the nod. He is a phony populist. </comment>

<comment>Oh yes - you, random internet guy says what Trump will do in the future. Because you are a genius.Or maybe you are just a dufus.</comment>

<comment>Hes not a billionaire,  and cant self fund his campaign. None of you trumpster divers can explain why he doesn't run as an independent. He is a phony populist, and will latch on to the RNC establishment soon enough.</comment>

<comment>It's a hostile takeover of the Republican Party. He's giving their voters a better deal than what they've gotten in a long time . It wasn't actually that hard to do for someone with his money and celebrity.</comment>

<comment>He has no money, he is not liquid, and has worthless assets. He is a complete sham, and will file his fifth BK.</comment>

<comment>That he is still so rich after so many bankruptcies is proof enough that he knows how to game the system. That's a guy I want on my side.</comment>

<comment>So, you want a con man on your side. Got it.</comment>

<comment>You probably can't even tie your own shoes - you are not qualified to make pronouncements on anything.</comment>

<comment>Can and have</comment>

<comment>I'm not complaining at all. I'm laughing to the point of tears at Jerry Jr. Nor did I mention any other candidate. Start an argument with someone else.</comment>

<comment>Didn't Falwell endorse Romney after saying Mormons aren't Christians?</comment>

<comment>I think that was Franklin Graham, another hypocrite who isn't half the man his father is.</comment>

<comment>Was it? Ok, comment withdrawn.</comment>

<comment>I think it was, but I could be wrong.</comment>

<comment>A twice divorced, casino-owning, womanizing, unrepentant, arrogant, death to the families of our enemies DOUCHE just received the endorsement of a man who claims to walk in the path of Jesus.“Man is tormented by no greater anxiety than to find someone quickly to whom he can hand over that great gift of freedom with which the ill-fated creature is born.”- The Grand InquisitorJerry Falwell would burn Jesus at the stake if he returned to earth.</comment>

<comment>Jerry would take offense at Jesus eating with people of whom Liberty University would disapprove, I am sure.</comment>

<comment>Trump will not participate in the debate on Thursday.  Bad move on his part, to keep playing the victim, and let Fox have their way with him on their network. </comment>

<comment>It's a power move. They need him more than he needs them at this point. He probably won't debate Hillary either.</comment>

<comment>Wrong, remember their yuuuge ratings before Trump. Well, they get to frame the message to all of those viewers. </comment>

<comment>You don't understand Trump's appeal. You're in good company. None of the GOP politicians do either.</comment>

<comment>I completely understand his appeal to nativists, nationalists, racists, and sexists.</comment>

<comment>Strictly speaking, white Americans can't really be nativists.</comment>

<comment>You got it wrong, it's "their country", they want it back.</comment>

<comment>I think white Americans are beginning to realize that they have more in common with other white people all over the world than they ever will with any Native, African, or Asian American.</comment>

<comment>American racists have a lot in common with other racists around the world </comment>

<comment>Twump supporters are waaaaycissss</comment>

<comment>You sir are correct.</comment>

<comment>Who really cares what white liberal beta males think?</comment>

<comment>The electoral college cares when you add them to minorities.</comment>

<comment>Trump changes the electoral map. The blue wall comes down. White rust belt states become competitive.</comment>

<comment>Wisconsin and Pennsylvania are losing a 4-5 percentage points of their white voters every presidential election and the Republicans have failed to win those states for decades.Maybe you flip Ohio, but Trump's alienation of Hispanics in the Southwest and Florida really hurts him. That doesn't even count all the moderates he alienates.Trump doesn't really change all that much on the map.</comment>

<comment>He gets 10-15% of the black vote too. That changes a lot. And he's already polling ahead of Hillary in PA. The percentage of white voters is shrinking because of immigrants but that white minority is decades away. It's not 1938 in Vienna yet.</comment>

<comment>Of course not, we have to have the 1932 elections first. Then President Trump can impose a state of emergency after those Communis- I mean, Black Lives Matter activists start a fire at the Reichsta- er, Capitol building.</comment>

<comment>Not really, Bush got around 10% of the Black vote in 2000 and he didn't win WI or PA. If Trump got more than 10% I'd be shocked. That's more a conservative delusion that Blacks will embrace Trump's psuedo-white populism.As for shrinking white voters, not a minority yet, but as I noted above when white liberals and women are added to minorities...Also, Trump has real problems & high negatives with educated swing voters and women voters. It'll be tight, but polling usually underestimates Dem turnout in Presidential elections.Truth is that Trump's negatives are even higher than Hillary's. As of now,he doesn't change the map all that much in my mind.</comment>

<comment>This nonsensical attitude that white people can't have a culture or a country or anything else to be proud of, or else they are raaaaaciiisssts who should hang their heads in shame at their "white privilege" is engendering blowblack in the form of Donald J. Trump.The Democrats have spent 30 years building a coalition of limousine liberals and minority groups, whipping up more and more resentment over less and less actual, measurable racism. The better to hide the miserable results of their policies, which have no real intention of bettering the lot of the groups their claim to champion. That would put them out of a job!As the wise saying goes, if a trend is unsustainable, it will stop.2016 may prove to be the stopping point of the Democratic strategy of "collect all the fringe groups and the limousine liberals; abandon the working classes"</comment>

<comment>"or a country"Name me one country (other than Israel) that restricts who can live in their country based on race.</comment>

<comment>I really don't think so. American Blacks are 100% American. They have the same cultural references, the same economic outlook, the same odd religious sensibility, shared schooling background, same tastes in sports, 200 plus years of common history, and nearly the same worldview. Where there are differences, there's a ton of sharing, for example with music. Have you traveled overseas much? The cultural differences on all those accounts are considerable, with the possible exception of the UK and Australia/New Zealand. And the UK is an odd experience, it seems just like home until people discuss religion, or class, then you are jarred from it.</comment>

<comment>The majority of my ancestry has not been in the US for 200 years. </comment>

<comment>I can't imagine this ignorant statement could be made by anyone who has traveled outside the US, nor anyone who has friends of any other races.</comment>

<comment>I have second citizenship. Some European countries offer it to the descendants of expats.</comment>

<comment>Prove it.</comment>

<comment>No, it's an understandable tactic actually. He's doing well. And doesn't want to risk his debate performance impacting that negatively. </comment>

<comment>And leave the rest of the stage to attack his bogus ideas? I don't think its a good strategy.</comment>

<comment>All they did was talk about me. Don't they have any ideas of their own.Trumps response writes itself.</comment>

<comment>Its about exposure, his response would be best suited during the debate, in front of millions, not some blurb the next day.</comment>

<comment>You're still playing by the old rules. Trump is writing new ones.</comment>

<comment>No he isnt</comment>

<comment>That liberal arts degree is serving you well. I'll see you tomorrow morning when you hand me my coffee at the Dunkin Donuts drive thru.</comment>

<comment>Insulting a man does not prove your point, only that you have no intellectual foundation for your beliefs.</comment>

<comment>Politics is not an intellectual pursuit. It's pure power, strategy, and self interest.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, strategy and accumulating power is in no way affected by intellectual capacity.</comment>

<comment>And you with the calculus that skipping an event that draws millions of viewers, is beneficial. </comment>

<comment>Not all liberal arts degrees are created equal.</comment>

<comment>Why do you drink terrible coffee?</comment>

<comment>And theres the perception of him being a phussy, not being able to handle the heat.  Trumpster divers believe this is a good look </comment>

<comment>It's worked so far, though.</comment>

<comment>come see terri's space for reasoned discussionhttps://disqus.com/home/channe...</comment>

<comment>No one will watch it without him.</comment>

<comment>No, it means he's a whiny brat who doesn't have the cojones to be president. </comment>

<comment>Or, alternatively, he's just a petulant baby who doesn't want any hard questions and thinks Megan Kelly is a meanie.</comment>

<comment>Falwell is just following the example of the Black churches who have chosen ethnic solidarity over Christian solidarity.</comment>

<comment>They tried to choose Christian solidarity, white evangelicals then ignored what Jesus believed and started worshiping Bull Connor.</comment>

<comment>Didn't much have a choice, did they?</comment>

<comment>“Imagine how wonderful it would be for once that the United States of America had as its president, a man… who runs the nation with the same entrepreneurial business principles that have brought success to their own companies.”I guess one can serve God and Mammon.</comment>

<comment>I would never have picked televangelists for theological consistency. After all, God wants them to fly around in private jets from what I hear </comment>

<comment>Liberty, Falwell, or trump have e never stood for religon. Its been about hate from day one. Perfect match</comment>

<comment>If Trump and Clinton are the nominees, Clinton is currently on track to beat Trump by 20 points among college educated voters- http://politicsthatwork.com/gr...Sanders would beat him by even more: 26 points- http://politicsthatwork.com/gr...</comment>

<comment>Yes, but not much more than 30% of us have college degrees.</comment>

<comment>Add in minority voters without college degrees, among whom Trump has very little support, and you'll have an electoral landslide. </comment>

<comment>Perhaps someone should alert the good reverend about the Donald's success which includes 3 (4?) corporate bankruptcies and inheriting a fortune from his father.</comment>

<comment>Of course Jerry Falwell sidelines religion because deep in his heart he knows Donald Trump knows diddly squat about the bible even though Trump did stand on stage with bible in hand which of course was done for show at the time!  It's hard to fathom how Jerry Falwell could endorse such a vile hate filled man with Falwell being a man of religion! Donald Trump's so called policies are far removed from WJWD that's for sure. Which goes to show what hypocrites some are when it comes to those who bang on about the bible day in day out.</comment>

<comment>Mammon spoke, falwell jumped.</comment>

<comment>My question is: what's in it for him?  What's Trump promised him?  Falwell and his ilk are disgusting.  Luckily, he's in the minority amongst religious leaders.</comment>

<comment>Question for evangelicals: How does it feel to see your leaders finally publicly embrace the hypocrisy those of outside your community have accused them of for decades?</comment>

<comment>Few evangelicals consider Falwell Jr. one of their leaders. But point taken.</comment>

<comment>Does this mean that Liberty U. will not be inviting any more presidential candidates to speak on its campus?</comment>

<comment>You go too far out of your way to try to explain Falwell's action. The explanation is simple: he's a theological lightweight who mistakes Americanism for the gospel.</comment>
