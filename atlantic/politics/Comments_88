<comment>Way to step up to one's Constitutional duties, Senate Republicans!</comment>

<comment>Mitch McConnell just induced me to make my first campaign contribution since 2008, to the DSCC. I'll be giving more to the eventual Democratic presidential nominee, with the fond hope that Barack Obama will be sitting in Antonin Scalia's chair next year.</comment>

<comment>What a witty rejoinder.</comment>

<comment>You'd be better off throwing your money at the D who runs against McConnell in KY. Clearly the people of the state love them some McConnell, but maybe a fresh candidate with lots of ad dollars would inspire some intelligence.</comment>

<comment>McConnell does not run again until 2020.  He will then be 78 years old.Senator Rand Paul has opposition for re-election this year.  If he supports the Republicans' abdication of duty, perhaps Democrats in Kentucky can make an issue of that, with McConnell being the indirect target.</comment>

<comment>And they will send him right on back to Washington by a healthy margin, if precedent serves, just like they've done since 1984. Perhaps he needs a good smack from the people of his state for being an obstructionist.</comment>

<comment>Uummm, the people in Kentucky have shown they approve of this. Even the ones who will lose their Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>By then we can only hope he is joining the honorable Mr Scalia in the heavenly choir.  Heaven is after all only for Republicans.</comment>

<comment>They already said that they're not going to confirm his nominee, even if it's him. Pay attention.</comment>

<comment>I said next year - when many Senate Republicans elected in blues states in the off-year GOP sweep of 2010 get replaced by Democrats.</comment>

<comment>There are 24 Republican Senate races to watch of the 34 races this year. Most are in purple States and States that went Obama in 2012.If Trump is the Republican nominee, then look for a massive turnout of Democrats. If Democrats win half, 17, they will have a filibuster proof majority.</comment>

<comment>I'm a life-long Democrat, and as things stand, I'd be a Trump voter in a hypothetical general election.  Nothing personal, but it's time to take our country back from the beltway-creatures once and for all.  Go Trump !</comment>

<comment>That would be something. Obama is still to young I suppsoe and I expect Obama to do more for society being unbound.</comment>

<comment>He would be the 1st POTUS since Taft fo join the court. It would be a fascinating move, and well suited to his constitutional law background and professor-like approach to issues.</comment>

<comment>If Obama ever got on the Court, I bet the other eight justices would find him to be one arrogant SOB. Clarance Thomas would almost certainly shit in his locker and Ginsburg would wish for Scalia to be back so she could have a drink with a real man.</comment>

<comment>Or, more likely, the court would be run more amiably. The rump of Alito and Thomas would be ignored by the intelligence on the rest of the court.</comment>

<comment>You do know that Scalia and Ginsberg were good friends, right? Hardly an endorsement that the court needs to be "run" more amiably. Unless what you mean by "run more amiably" is that you'd have more decisions with which you'd agree. And if that's what you mean, that's fine. Just don't pretend that it's something else.</comment>

<comment>I have been old enough to vote and did so in the last 9 presidential elections. Never before have I voted a straight ticket, but after what the republicans have done during Obama's office I am voting a straight democratic ticket, and yes, even if I have to vote for some democrats I don't like. Plenty of people I know are saying the same thing. Enough is enough.</comment>

<comment>Constitutional duties?  They've already shut the government down and raised doubt about the validity of the public debt (i.e. the 14th amendment).  These people don't care about constitutional duties.</comment>

<comment>But doesn't that make them feel bad about themselves? And guilty that they are taking all that taxpayer money for doing nothing?</comment>

<comment>Not all. At least Kirk and Collins are breaking ranks. Moderates like them should be applauded.</comment>

<comment>They're just trying to save their own jobs by getting as far away from this as they can.  But it won't matter.  The problem with the senate is that Obama's nominee won't get a vote because McConnell won't let him/her.  If allowed a vote on the floor a well qualified moderate could easily pick up four Republican votes.  But the senate majority leader and/or the chairman of the judiciary committee (both positions that don't actually exist in the constitution) are able to block the vote.  Maybe somebody should start challenging some of these senate rules in the supreme court.  Checks and balances.</comment>

<comment>Their sole duty is to provide "advice and consent" for his nominations and they've just advised that they will not be consenting.  Duty fulfilled.</comment>

<comment>So what stops them from doing this from the first year of a president that they don't like takes office?  Sorry, this excuse is pure BS.</comment>

<comment>I'd expect ultimately you might reach a point where the Supreme Court itself steps in, but absent that I see nothing that would prevent them from never voting, unless the American people really got annoyed and used the election to put in people that would.</comment>

<comment>So Congress could discharge their duty under Article 2, Section 1 "Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes", by not actually picking any date, and thus preventing a new president from being constitutionally elected?</comment>

<comment>It's a rather moot point since Congress has already picked the date and it is part of Federal election law.  However, the specific word is  "may", not "must" or "will" or "shall" which are all words that compel action. Look elsewhere for that language, like Article I Section 7:"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills."Does that mean that the Senate has to propose amendments to House revenue bills?  Of course not, but they can if they choose to.If in some alternate reality Congress had never picked a day I expect it would fall to the individual States when their Electors would be chosen by and when they would vote.  You'll notice the text uses the word "shall" to tell us what happens when the votes are received:"The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;"It provides a timeline for what happens if there is no majority again using the words "shall" and "immediately":"the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President."Further it even defines what happens if they don't choose a President:"And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice-President shall act as President,"</comment>

<comment>At this point all they're doing is demonstrating why the GOP shouldn't exist at all.</comment>

<comment>The Senate promises to sit on their hands and do nothing all year.... well, at least they're being honest about it this time around.</comment>

<comment>Can Senator Leahy call the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee together to hold shadow hearings, with empty chairs for the Republicans?</comment>

<comment>And consistent </comment>

<comment>They recognize that the danger of hearings is that the moderation of Obama's nominee will be contrasted with their own intransigence.Obama is not unaware of this. He will see to it that just such a comparison takes place.</comment>

<comment>On the Senate Judiciary Committee there are, shall we say, varying levels of intellect on the Republican side.  McConnell and Company likely don't want to generate video of a super sharp black or brown nominee being examined by the likes of David (Diapers) Vitter.</comment>

<comment>Any potential candidates (Srinivasan, Watford, Millet) would shred them.Brilliant legal minds 1, Senate numb skulls, 0.</comment>

<comment>It says right there in that constitution thingy that Presidents are elected to 4 year terms except when the President is a democrat, communist, muslim, atheist, terrorist  black panther, then it is only a 3 year term and the last year doesn't count because there is an ongoing election.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the goalposts will be moved. Should a Dem president get elected, the concern will be the "2020 ongoing election, because the people should be heard." :)</comment>

<comment>Yup! And "constitution thingy" is just how the Right thinks.</comment>

<comment>It’s about the principle, not the personality… which is why McConnell clarified that the vacancy "should not be filled by THIS lame-duck president."</comment>

<comment>Equally, the principle of following the law and their duties. But that refusal is ironically more about personality.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. The principle of "If Obama wants, we hate it." The one real governing principle the Republicans have been following since Jan. 20, 2009.</comment>

<comment>If it makes you feel any better Joe Biden from 1992 agrees with not nominating in election years...http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>How is that supposed to make me feel better about politicians not doing their jobs?</comment>

<comment>Lots of people suffer from a condition known as "partisan hackery", a psychosomatic disorder which only causes a negative reaction to the actions of political parties they do not support, but not to those same actions taken by ones they do.  So I thought if you knew a Democrat also suggested it that might lessen your reaction.</comment>

<comment>Highly disappointing. Instead of blocking Obama's surely moderate-to-liberal SCOTUS, they should be out in force telling the country why conservative principles like the ones that Justice Scalia espoused are worth protecting and fighting for.All this is doing is driving our country further to the left and opening the door for Clinton to claim victory. This is worse than Trump being the nominee.</comment>

<comment>what if Obama went ahead and nominated Trump for SCOTUS?  Would heads across Washington DC explode?</comment>

<comment>Mine, for one. While it's not required to be a lawyer, Trump as SCOTUS would be unprecedented.</comment>

<comment>This obstructionism is simply exhausting.One would hope at some point this GOP will realize, or be compelled by some externality to realize, that is has to attempt to govern, but I suppose we ought not hold our breath.</comment>

<comment>Sad but true.</comment>

<comment>But, look at it from their point of view: they've refused to govern for 7 years, and have gotten away with it. The sleaze-bags in their base reward them for refusing to govern. So from their position they see no need to govern.</comment>

<comment>Did it ever occur to you maybe they actually don't like the things government does and believe "That government is best which governs the least, "?</comment>

<comment>Sure. But I'm a realist. The nation, and world, are not what they were in Jefferson's time. Going backward, to small government, is a pipedream, not a governing principle. Reagan, always cited as virtually a holy man by the Right, in fact presided over a huge expansion of government. Government is like entropy: there's no reversing it. Like it or not.</comment>

<comment>It always reverses because government eventually grows beyond the means of its people to pay for it or it gets conquered either from internal or external foes.</comment>

<comment>Well, maybe. But I'm not much of a fan of generalizations like this. I know of no government in history that has reversed its growth, though indeed some have collapsed. But what is a certainty is that the United States government has never, at any time, become smaller. Maybe more to the point is that "big" or "small" are meaningless terms when it comes to talking about small government. The question is who and what is the best way to solve the problem. There can be argument about that, for sure, but it's about the best way to solve a problem, not about somebody's political philosophy. Example: healthcare. The question is what's the best way to solve healthcare problems. Maybe private enterprise, m aybe government, but **that's** the place to argue, not in the realm of vague philosophical stuff like small or big government.</comment>

<comment>Lame duck refers to when the successor has already been elected but hasn't yet taken office. Obama won't be a lame duck president until November.</comment>

<comment>Exactly right.  Perhaps people should demonstrate wherever McConnell appears and light a pair of pants on fire.</comment>

<comment>Or ducks.</comment>

<comment>Not to light on fire, I surmise.</comment>

<comment>Wooden ones?</comment>

<comment>Tsk tsk tsk! Attempting to bring facts to a discussion with Republicans.</comment>

<comment>You might also want to make sure your opponent isn't also correctly using the word..."one whose position or term of office will soon end"http://www.merriam-webster.com...</comment>

<comment>Sure. And so the question is, who gets to define "soon"? The most common use of the word is "someone who lost the election to his office, but the new guy hasn't been installed."</comment>

<comment>A lame duck is also an ineffectual person which I think describes most of Obama's presidency save his first year or two.</comment>

<comment>Well, no. It's just not used that way in a political context. And you surely know McConnell isn'the saying that. </comment>

<comment>Well, I certainly don't think McConnell believes Obama is a strong leader given he's been in Congress and seen how little Obama has been able to push of his agenda there and how much he's had to resort to Executive Orders for.  Though yes, in popular usage a lame duck is someone whose successor has already been chosen and is counting down their final months in office.</comment>

<comment>It also refers to "one whose position or term of office will soon end"http://www.merriam-webster.com...</comment>

<comment>Looking forward to President Hilary Clinton nominating Barak Obama to SCOTUS.</comment>

<comment>EGGZ-ACTLY!!Quid pro quo for the Sec of State.Now we're speaking Hillary's language!!!</comment>

<comment>Looking forward to none of her appointments being considered either. Remember, us anti-government types are quite happy with gridlock, in fact next to government actively making itself smaller it's the best state it can exist in.</comment>

<comment>President Obama should go ahead and nominate someone superbly qualified.  Especially if no confirmation hearings are held, the President should respond by making a recess appointment.  (Not necessarily the same person.)Can B!tch McConnell say Justice William Jefferson Clinton?</comment>

<comment>I thought you said someone "superbly qualified"?</comment>

<comment>I also said not necessarily the same person.  One point of making the recess appointment is to show disrespect for those who have refused to do the job that they hired out to do.Bill Clinton, however, does have the legal chops.  He taught at the University of Arkansas law school and served as the state Attorney General before his election as governor.  Service in elective office is also important for the perspective that that offers.</comment>

<comment>For a recess appointment he should have some fun with it.  Appoint the most liberal person possible.  Grab one of those hippies from the Occupy camps.</comment>

<comment>Why should he start nominating qualified people now?  He should stick to nominating people with tax problems.</comment>

<comment>Witness the power of solidarity. We are weak when we allow ourselves to become divided, together we can tear this country apart.</comment>

<comment>I am actually happy about this because the nail is now driven into the coffins of Toomey and Portman in PA & OH.</comment>

<comment>...and the nail in the coffin for them comes long before the election.</comment>

<comment>They're just following the Biden Rule. What's the issue?</comment>

<comment>The Biden snippet, more like.</comment>

<comment>The Biden Rule?</comment>

<comment>"It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over."- Joe Biden in 1992http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>Was there a vacancies in that year? Did the Democrats not have a hearing on nominees?</comment>

<comment>Have the Republicans failed to hold a hearing on a nominee?  Their position on the matter is the same as Biden's.</comment>

<comment>That's a rule?And what month in 1992 did he say that?   And was there an opening on the court or was he speculating about the possible impulsive, discretionary retirement by a justice hoping to have his/her replacement chosen by Bush?It's not nearly the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Ask the OP, I was merely attempting to provide you background on what I believe he was referring to.There was no opening on the Court at the time just like there is no Obama nominee at this time.</comment>

<comment>I'd like to thank Mitch McConnell and the GOP leadership for handing the Senate back to us, and am confident that Majority Leader Chuck Schumer will finally eliminate the undemocratic anachronism that is the filibuster.</comment>

<comment>So, considering the substance of this article, maybe we change that sentence in the last paragraph from "or they take the consolation prize of making them look unreasonable and obstructionist by denying a qualified potential justice so much as a hearing" to "or they spend the election season pointing out how pathologically unreasonable and obstructionist they're being by denying a qualified potential justice so much as a hearing."Also - there is not an ice cream cone's chance in hell of Cruz or Trump being elected by the general public. One is a melted-face sociopath and the other is everyone's always drunk, very racist uncle.</comment>

<comment>I think it all boils down to conservative male anxiety.  They are just so threatened by the big scary black dude in the Oval Office.Just wait until the emasculating mom gets elected.</comment>

<comment>Looking forward to 4 more years of gridlock.  Ideally it will be such a bitter fight the politicians will forget the rest of us even exist and the government will leave us in peace.</comment>

<comment>They have perfected the art of politically correct racism to a frightening degree.</comment>

<comment>For the time being, at least, McConnell, Cornyn, et al, are playing a losing hand of Kentucky-Texas Hold'em. The sturm-und-drang of the primaries notwithstanding, all the betting sites and U Iowa's estimable Electronic Markets in election outcomes show strong odds of a Democratic win in the presidential contest. Given those cards, it would be smarter political poker for the GOP to consider and approve a relatively moderate SJC candidate now rather than an inevitably more liberal candidate later.http://predictwise.com/politic...https://iemweb.biz.uiowa.edu/g...</comment>

<comment>Such an example to the world.</comment>

<comment>I also disagree with Mitch McConnell. Pres. Obama should nominate a candidate to fill the Supreme Court vacancy. The President is obviously aware that an election was held and the Republicans control the Senate 54 to 44 with two independents. He must consult with Senate leadership and propose a candidate acceptable to the majority. I know there is no way that he will do that because he is an ideologue and puts his personal beliefs before the good of the country. He is incapable of behaving otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Actually proposing a candidate acceptable to a majority of senators wouldn't be that hard.  Getting the "majority" leader to schedule the vote is the hard part.</comment>

<comment>I think the quotes go around "leader" there. It's like herding cats on the Hill these days. I don't envy them.</comment>

<comment>Republicans hijacking the social contract.Classy.</comment>

<comment>An obviously partisan comment that ignores that Joe Biden suggested this course of action in 1992:"It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over."http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>What outstanding champions of democracy!  Makes me proud to be an American.</comment>

<comment>What part of the majority declining to accept the Presidents appointment isn't democratic?</comment>

<comment>The problem is that the Senate refuses even to vet proposed candidates.  The Senate leadership, who control things, are refusing to do the job appointed them by the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>They can't fail to do it because the Constitution doesn't specify any mechanism they are required to use to provide consent.  It doesn't say they provide consent by a majority yea vote and absent any specific mechanism for that Article 1 Section 5 applies which states "Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings".This is really no different than the Senate not voting on bills sent to it from the House.  The Constitution doesn't require it and none of its internal rules do either.</comment>

<comment>Article II, Section 2: ..he (the President) shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint...judges of the supreme Court...Doesn't look like there is any time line or requirement for the Senate to act in any particular manner, but they do have to act for a nominee to sit.  So Mitch's ass is covered but it still looks like he is not doing his job.  Theoretically, the court could die off one by one till the makeup suited either the President or the Senate.  Theoretically, the court could die off till there were no judges.An interesting concept; failure to act is no failure because there is no specific requirement that anyone does his job.  Plus, he gets to decide how he won't do it.Now THAT'S gridlock at work.</comment>

<comment>Now let's see if it will hold</comment>

<comment>Dumb asses have no intention of honoring any such 'pledge'. If this was their real intent, they would have just shut up and made certain there were no recesses through Jan. 2017.</comment>

<comment>Go for it Mr. President.  Call their bluff, and expose their cards.</comment>

<comment>Why you are at it deploy some more of that executive power to close Gitmo.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't that be grounds to remove them from office?They swore an oath.</comment>

<comment>Who would impeach them en masse?</comment>

<comment>No one, realistically.But also, realistically, this is a violation of their oath.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry you don't like the Republicans fighting back.For once.</comment>

<comment>As long as I don't have to hear about how much they love the Constitution after this, sure.Because this is blatantly unconstitutional.Frankly, I love how pathetically desperate they are. </comment>

<comment>Their oath is to the Constitution, which only requires them to give "advice and consent" on the President's nominees.  They've advised him they aren't going to consent.  Duty fulfilled.</comment>

<comment>What you just wrote is contradictory.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your in depth analysis.Consent in this context means approval and they've made it clear they don't approve.</comment>

<comment>False.They've made it clear they intend to do nothing, no matter who he nominates.This is not 'consent or advise'.  It's refusal to fulfill their constitutional oath.  It makes sense though.  Hearings are perilously close to actual work.  They'd rather spend their scant four months in Washington naming a few more post offices or symbolically repealing Obamacare. </comment>

<comment>Except the Constitution defines no specific mechanism by which they give their consent.  It doesn't say they give it by simple majority vote and absent a specific mechanism Article I Section 5 allows "Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings".  So, just like the Senate has no rules that require it to vote on any bills that the House sends it, they also have no rules that they MUST vote on judicial nominees.</comment>

<comment>If it were a Bush nominee and a Dem congress the same exact thing would happen. Doesnt make it right, it just makes it what is.</comment>

<comment>Maybe. But I don't think the dems would've come out as complete assholes about it before Scalia's body was even cold.The dems would've likely held to process, and evaluated the nominee/s. And then swiftly rejected them because they'd likely be uber-right wing ideologues, as we seem to have lately.</comment>

<comment>yeah, the Dems would have a show trial.  The end result might be the same, but I highly doubt they'd just cut the debate off at the knees.This is why I had to leave the GOP 20 years ago.  The Dems generally want to debate the issues, because they think generally they have the right ones.  They want MORE people to vote.  The want less power for the powerful, and more power for the weak.  They want full accounting for externalities.  One can certainly debate whether their policies actually lead to that (IMO doubtful in many cases), and in many cases the things they want actually aren't popular.  But they generally are for a big tent democracy.The GOP on the other hand wants a small democracy.  The believe some folks are uneducated and don't deserve a vote because they are "takers".  Lets not openly debate tradeoffs/merits of the Dem policies - we'll repeal now and we'll get around to "replacing" some other time.  Lets repeal the PAYGO rules (Yes, the GOP did this), so that they don't actually have to make the budget math add up.  Lets build an expensive wall now, and deal with the folks already here/immigrant employment/legal immigration system problems later.  Lets cut taxes now, and we'll get more specific about the budget cuts later.  Basically they do the "easy" now, and ignore the hard choices.This is just more the same.</comment>

<comment>Only legal citizens should vote, but that would destroy the liberal agenda of ruining America.</comment>

<comment>I agree with that first statement.  Is there evidence that that isn't currently the case?</comment>

<comment>Other than Obama's policies on illegal Immigrants?</comment>

<comment>Inane comment - no substance.</comment>

<comment>Oh they would have dragged it out until it was probably too late. Not that hard as often as Congress is on recess. But they would have gone through the motions rather than refusing to even consider the President's nominee.</comment>

<comment>But it didn’t, did it?</comment>

<comment>"we didn't get a chance to, so it's okay!"Liberal logic.</comment>

<comment>“So we didn’t do what we're accused of, but you can accuse us of doing so just the same!"</comment>

<comment>"We really wanted to, but didn't get the chance. You doing what we wanted to do is not okay."</comment>

<comment>Such action will make it much more likely that we get a Dem senate in the next election...  claiming you'll only do your job 3 out of 4 years isn't going to play well in the blue/purple states where there are GOP senate incumbents trying to hold their seat.The funny thing is, Hillary/Bernie are such weak candidates, it is entirely plausible that they lose (I don't think this action will impact the Presidential race much)...  but because of this, the Dems could take back the Senate...  and in the ~20-days between when the senate is sworn in and the GOP President...  they could approve any Obama nominee.That would be awesome.</comment>

<comment>Because if the last several elections have taught us anything it's that voters will punish Republican obstruction by making them the majority party in both chambers of Congress and the majority of the US states.</comment>

<comment>This just in: Voters pledge to not vote for a party that refuses to abide by their oath of office.</comment>

<comment>Got to say that this sounds like a risky strategy.You can always bet on a lot of Democratic voters essentially being lazy ('disillusioned') and not showing up.  Having a supreme court position on the cards would seem a really good way of motivating them.</comment>

<comment>If they aren't motivated by free college, free healthcare, and whatever else Bernie is promising to get them to vote for him over Hillary I highly doubt the Supreme Court will.  I'll wait for them to dust off the war on women thing.  It didn't fly in the last election, but maybe with the Supreme Court you can scare them into thinking abortion will get taken away and if you can't kill fetuses what is the point of living?</comment>

<comment>That is OK but I think it might hurt them.</comment>

<comment>They're bluffing.They hope Obama nominates a bad candidate. Then they'll suddenly hold a hearing, naturally rejecting the candidate because Obama picked someone with poor qualifications.The Republicans will be vindicated: they will double back, claiming they satisfied their Constitutional duties after all.Obama should nominate a ringer. Then they'll look more foolish than they already do.</comment>

<comment>No surprise here.  The GOP has been refusing to step up to its duties for quite a while now.  When a dem is voted in as the next POTUS, do you think they refuse for another 4 years?</comment>

<comment>Yes. They'll eat their Capitol building graham crackers, crap their pants and collect paychecks.The party of small government loves getting its cake and eating it, too. I hope voters wake up to this nonsense sooner than later.</comment>

<comment>Coming from the party of the alphabet people that is rich...</comment>

<comment>After all that work McConnell has done over the past year and half to shake that obstructionist moniker.  Clearly not a battle he wanted at this point in time.</comment>

<comment>They don't need to pledge, we all know that if Obama starts the conversation, that the obstructionists will obstruct it.</comment>

<comment>Well, there goes the Repub Senate majority. Five "at risk" seats will likely be lost b/c of their decision here.</comment>

<comment>Never happen.</comment>

<comment>If anything they'll be reelected.</comment>

<comment>And another brilliant analysis...by someone that "knows" -- for certain.</comment>

<comment>Looking like a Republican landslide.Keep it up, guys.Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>"How stupid are the people of Iowa?"Trump 2016.</comment>

<comment>Pretty stupid. They listened to Ted Cruz' cheating.</comment>

<comment>"Ted Cruz is a nasty guy."You won Evangelicals in South Carolina. You won with fat, skinny, people.You won highly educated, somewhat educated, and poorly educated.Trump 2016.</comment>

<comment>Weird what happens when the Evangelical candidate cheats, right?</comment>

<comment>He didn't read Trump: The Art of the Deal</comment>

<comment>In all seriousness, I feel bad for Cruz.His career is over, at 45</comment>

<comment>It's been a disaster since day 1.</comment>

<comment>Democrats are literally too stupid to know who Scalia was.Good strategy, guys.</comment>

<comment>Scalia is my punk band's name.Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Someone who helped do great damage to the country.  We know.</comment>

<comment>Great Supreme Court Justice, or Greatest Supreme Court Justice?</comment>

<comment>Well, if that's the gamble they want to make. They'd better hope it works out for them. If Hillary wins, they will get a more liberal nominee than Obama is willing to offer this late in his term. Probably a lot younger too. And who would Trump appoint?</comment>

<comment>EFF these creeps, especially Mitch "Red Eared Slider" McConnell.  The ONE good thing is they are burying the republican brand.  Anyone that says "republicans get things done" is lying.  All they can do is seethe and say "No." And that's their skill set.  (OK, Denny Hastert has some other skills, I guess...)</comment>

<comment>^Lightweight</comment>

<comment>Donald, did you just pass gas?  Jeeze...</comment>

<comment>Just as Obama was elected president by the voters, the voters elected a majority Republican Congress. And the voters didn't elect a majority Republican Congress because they wanted Obama's agenda to proceed unimpeded.The best entertainment I've had in a while is listening to liberals whine "But the Constitution..." Uh huh. NOW they're worried about the Constitution, when for seven years they've approved of the laws that Obama has made (a right that is specifically given to the Congress, not the president) and the laws that Obama has ignored (under his "prosecutorial discretion"). Maybe liberals will be appeased if they think of it as "senatorial discretion" if the senate doesn't approve Obama's Supreme Court nominee.In 2006, Senator Obama joined in the filibuster to prevent Bush's nominee Samuel Alito from being confirmed.In 2007, Senator Chuck Schumer promised to do "everything in my power" to prevent another Roberts or Alito from being confirmed to the Supreme Court.In 1992, Senator Joe Biden said a sitting president shouldn't nominate anyone to the Supreme Court during the throes of a political season and presidential campaign.Now...The shoe is on the other foot.The tables have turned.The tide has changed.In other words, payback is a b*tch, isn't it?</comment>

<comment>But those were Democrats.That's different.</comment>

<comment>Well, they could have passed some laws. No one was stopping them.</comment>

<comment>And the Senate approved the referenced nominations after purely symbolic votes.And comments from a Senator in a different context from 2 1/2 decades past are hardly probative. Biden was wrong then. But McConnell is usurping the powers of the Presidency by refusing to allow even a consideration of a possible nominee. So much for the GOP's "Constitutionalists."</comment>

<comment>Lol.</comment>

<comment>The so-called Alito filibuster has become the Big Lie of the Week.A filibuster begins with an unsuccessful vote to invoke cloture.  Which, with Alito, never happened.</comment>

<comment>Semantics arguments are fun</comment>

<comment>Get a dictionary.</comment>

<comment>Hang tough GOP. The lying hypocritical liberals would do the same thing if the positions were reversed - oh wait, they already have. Remember Robert Bork.</comment>

<comment>Bork was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for the United States Court of Appeals, yet when he was nominated to be on the Supreme Court, Democrats who had voted for his nomination to the Court of Appeals thwarted his nomination to the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>After his nomination was vetted by the Senate, debated and voted upon. Note the difference?</comment>

<comment>Yep. Liberals destroyed him.No need for McConnell to even consider an Obamanee</comment>

<comment>He was not destroyed.  He still had a lifetime appointment to the federal bench.  Which he resigned of his own volition.</comment>

<comment>He was destroyed. After a unanimous vote confirming him to the Appeals court.But please keep rambling on about "muh racism!"</comment>

<comment>Robert Bork actually got a vote, and he was thrown out on his ear, just as a hater of the Constitution such as him deserved to be.He hated the Constitution's guts, and you even know it.</comment>

<comment>LOL Moron</comment>

<comment>I hated the man myself, but that doesn't change the nature of the charge. All are guilty.</comment>

<comment>I'll certainly admit that there is plenty of hypocrisy and usage of double standards to go around.But, to my knowledge, McConnell's arrogant attitude is unprecedented.  Stating in advance that he won't bring anyone to the floor?President Obama should just burn him with a recess appointment.</comment>

<comment>It's been a long play with too few intermissions. Let's just see how it ends.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that the truth!  Sounds like a plan.</comment>

<comment>Unbelievably shortsighted. The very likely consequences: (1) Obama/Clinton/Sanders use this issue to beat the GOP senseless (more senseless?) over the next 8 months, (2) the GOP loses the senate, (3) the Dems win the White House, (4) McConnell gets neutered and ultimately booted, and (5) Dems pick successors to Scalia, then RBG, then Breyer, then Kennedy. The arrogance and stupidity of this GOP chess move is mind boggling. </comment>

<comment>Counter point: Most Democrats don't know who Scalia was.They're morons.This will get Republicans elected.</comment>

<comment>Pot calling the kettle black.</comment>

<comment>I would not take the gamble, personally. </comment>

<comment>Obama should nominate Trump's sister after Super Tuesday.   Pull the pin, drop the grenade, and watch the Republican party explode.</comment>

<comment>Brilliant. Up-vote.</comment>

<comment>I like that!</comment>

<comment>Funny thing about that... She can just decline.</comment>

<comment>Sure she could but why would she?</comment>

<comment>She's 78.</comment>

<comment>Today's edition of GUESS WHO SAID IT!Did you guess the right answer?  Why yes, it was the New York Times!  That's right, the same New York Times that doesn't like it that Republicans, who regained control of the Senate, are resisting a change in the Court's direction.Sometimes it seems that the only certainty in this world is liberal hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>And what happened next - the Senate confirmed Justice Kennedy in an election year.</comment>

<comment>Nobody has argued that the Senate does not have the right to reject a nominee. What McConnell is saying is that, regardless of who the nominee is, not even any hearings will be held. Bork got hearings. When the Judiciary Committee voted against him it allowed, at his insistence, his name to be put before the entire Senate. He was rejected.</comment>

<comment>For pity sake there isn't even a nominee yet!</comment>

<comment>This whole strategy is predicated on the possibility that a Republican can win the white house. It's far more likely that a Democrat will win, and that senate seats will ride on their coattails.  The Senate should consider themselves lucky to have any leverage at all as they're likely to lose it after the election, paving the way for a much MORE liberal nominee in a year. Lately the Republicans have been very consistent in shooting themselves in the foot, and it seems nothing is changing. </comment>

<comment>I wouldn't say it's far more likely. But the odds are not in their favor. I'd guess 60/40 Democrats win the White House.</comment>

<comment>I'd guess much more lopsided if Trump is the nominee.</comment>

<comment>80-20 Republicans if Trump is nominee.</comment>

<comment>Is any oddsmaker offering that bet?</comment>

<comment>Only the ones who want to lose money.</comment>

<comment>That is my point.  Those who take bets don't care about the politics.</comment>

<comment>I dunno, the working class was ignored for a long time. They are more likely to vote than Latinos. And if younger voters are disillusioned enough by Sanders getting knocked out of the race, Hillary might have turn out problems. I still put the odds in her corner, but it's not airtight.</comment>

<comment>You may be right about those groups, though I hope not. There may be some hope that Hillary can get through to the working class how they've been suckered by the Republicans, but she's not all that good at that sort of thing.</comment>

<comment>No, she's not. Especially since she's the one destroying the working class.</comment>

<comment>I think that's overly optimistic for the Republicans.  Trump has alienated too many people to win a majority of the general population, and despite the rhetoric on the debate stage, I think there's a sizable chunk of Republicans who don't think that Trump will be a better president than either Democratic candidate.  I also think the reverse isn't true; in other words, Bernie supporters will support Hillary over any other Republican, and vice versa.  I think Ted Cruz faces a likability issue, in addition to the same problems Trump has with alienating people.  Rubio probably has the best chance of winning the general (provided Kasich doesn't miraculously win the primaries), but I don't think he has the experience yet to go head to head against either of the Democrats, given his debate gaffes to date.  I also don't think he has much likability, but I DO think that nearly all Republicans would prefer him to any Democrat.  It's a tough call as to whether Rubio can generate enough enthusiasm to force a brokered convention, let alone an outright win, but I wouldn't put it past him.  Given these constraints, I think the Republicans are going to have an extremely difficult time winning the White House, and nothing close to a 40% chance.  The Republican behavior in the Senate with regard to the Supreme Court nomination is only hurting that chance.</comment>

<comment>Except Democrats don't know who Scalia is, black people don't care about the SCOTUS and neither do the people suffering in Obama's economy.</comment>

<comment>Even if democrats didn't know who Scalia was last week (there's no reason to think they didn't know, but let's assume you're correct). they surely know now given the media coverage.  The idea that blacks don't care about SCOTUS a completely ahistorical.  In fact, blacks were the most successful group at affecting social change through the courts during the civil rights era.  I would confidently claim that no other group has made better use of the courts than blacks.  As far as "people suffering in Obama's economy" that's a little too unspecific for me to comment on.  Many people (possibly yourself?) claim to be suffering merely because Obama is president, and for no other reason.  It's not "Obama's economy" anyway, the President executes the law, they don't create it, especially with regard to the economy.  The President can advise the legislature, but ultimate they write the rules of the economy, as well as the Fed, which is fairly independent (in much the same way as the SCOTUS).</comment>

<comment>Let's put it this was, blacks are doing worse under Obama than any other group.The SCOTUS isn't going to be a reason they vote Hillary.You're not going to mobilize the base by saying hurr durr Scalia, when most Dims don't even know who he was.</comment>

<comment>I think you're missing the fundamental point.  Even if Democrats don't know who Scalia was (again, I don't know why you think Democrats are somehow more ignorant of Scalia than any other political group), I'm not talking about the effects of Senatorial gridlock on Democrats, but on Republicans.  Democrats are going to vote for one of the democrats because both candidates are basically the same and they are both basically standard liberal democrats.  Republicans, on the other hand, are currently fractured, and those who support one may not agree at all with another.  For example, let's say that Rubio wins the nomination.  Those who support Trump are going to see the Senatorial gridlock as just more politics as usual and many of them will either vote for Bernie, who's basically claiming to be anti-establishment as well, or just won't turn out to vote at all because they see Rubio as too establishment and the democrats as too Liberal.  Do you see how in this claim it doesn't matter if Democrats know anything about Scalia?</comment>

<comment>You understand I legitimately don't care what you say, right?</comment>

<comment>Let's say Trump wins.  Now Rubio supporters are torn between someone way to their right, and someone way to their left.  Some will vote right, some will vote left, and some will see no good options and opt out.  And instead of having a moderate Supreme Court nomination close to their ideological position, they now have to contend with a strong Hillary or Trump nomination.  Again, they are unhappy with the party and less likely to vote, harming the Republican chances.  Now does it make sense?</comment>

<comment>Rubio has supporters?</comment>

<comment>You act like Trump is running away with the election.  Trump has like 35% of 50% of the population.  That's only 17.5% of the electorate.  I wouldn't be so confident just yet.</comment>

<comment>I love the "statistics" meme. Please keep repeating it. Word for word.</comment>

<comment>I can't make it any simpler for you, sorry.</comment>

<comment>No need. You're repeating nonsensical jibber jabber. I don't blame you though.</comment>

<comment>Blacks care about judicial decisions such as Shelby County v. Holder.  I suspect that the wellspring of much of B!tch McConnell's intransigence is Senate Republicans' (and Republican donors') fears that replacing Scalia with an honest jurist will mean that more, uh, nigrahs will get to vote.</comment>

<comment>Literally making things up. Well done.Hurr durr Republicans are racist even though George Wallace was a Democrat and the Democrats are the party of the Klan.Love it.</comment>

<comment>Troll - go lick your wounds & privates.</comment>

<comment>This is much, much better for the forces of good than the story indicates. By giving Obama and the Democrats a gorgeous opportunity to show the world the Republicans true colors as the Party of No, of My Way or the Highway, if We Are the Party of Good And You Are the Spawn of the Devil, McConnell and friends have done Obama and the nation a huge service. Barring complete political ineptitude, this will mean a great chance to bring in several Democratic Senators on Hillary's coattails. Given that the general election sure looks like it shaping up to be Hillary vs. Donnie, we may have most Democratic election results, up and down the ticket. since Goldwater in 1964.</comment>

<comment>Wishful thinking. Bad comparison.</comment>

<comment>Please defend the Iran deal. You hack</comment>

<comment>Beats an Iran war.</comment>

<comment>Why would there be an Iran War?</comment>

<comment>What's the alternative to the deal? A no fly zone? Oh wait, you're Trump, you'd say, a better deal. Fair enough.</comment>

<comment>Um, not having a deal.</comment>

<comment>Ah, yes, another brilliant insight: "you hack."Very, very briefly: we had two choices: Iran gets a nuke within 18 months, or Iran definitely doesn't get one for 10 years and maybe much, much longer. And 10 years is enough to make a difference in their government.  If there was no deal, and they decided to go full speed ahead on a nuke, there'd be NOTHING we could do about it. Adults know that sometimes you only have two choices: a not so good one and a terrible one.</comment>

<comment>And why would it matter if Iran got a nuclear weapon, you hack</comment>

<comment>Thanks, man! You've made my case for me! I don't think there's anyone on this list who can't see what a cataclysm it would be if Iran got a nuke. Except for you. So now everybody can see just what sort of guy you are.</comment>

<comment>No I'm serious. What difference would it make if Iran had a nuclear weapon?</comment>

<comment>OK. Iran is a terrorist nation, supporting Hezbollah, run by religious fanatics committed to the destruction of Israel, and hated by the other hyper-religious country, Saudi Arabia. So a nuke for Iran would give them power of nuclear blackmail over Israel, Saudi Arabia, and anyone else they decide to use it on. Israel has nukes. So we'd be looking a nuclear-armed Mideast, with one country, Iran, run by the most dangerous possible kind of person: absolute religious fanatics.</comment>

<comment>How bigoted of you. Towards such a great group of people.</comment>

<comment>Aw come on. Do you have to turn everything into some sort of liberals-are-the-spawn-of-the-devil rant?</comment>

<comment>Oh we could have started a war. But we wouldn't have liked the results.</comment>

<comment>Well, yes. And the result would make the current Mideast disaster, the result of the Iraq War, look like a garden party.</comment>

<comment>Heckuva party. Have you tried the canapes?</comment>

<comment>I really do like Democrats acting like this is an issue.When A.) They've done this, suggested it, and acted on it before.B.) Democrats are stupid creatures who don't know who Justice Scalia was prior to his murder.C.) Hillary is a joke of a candidate.Enjoying the Republican landslide for this strategy.Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>No party has ever done what Republicans are doing now.  I'd defy you to find such an example.</comment>

<comment>Biden in 92Schumer saying the same thing.Bork.Alito. Thomas.Etc etc etc.Hasta Luego Troll!</comment>

<comment>Bork got a vote - lost it.Alito got a vote - was confirmed.Thomas got a vote - was confirmed.Still waiting.</comment>

<comment>So torpedoing a nominee after unanimously confirming him before is okay?Solid.Filibustering and attempting to destroy Thomas and Alito is good too? Cool</comment>

<comment>If Senators don't want to vote for a nominee, they don't have to. No one is suggesting otherwise.  That's not what's at issue here.</comment>

<comment>No, the issue is you have different standards for different parties.</comment>

<comment>No I don't.  I expect both sides to have hearings and hold votes on nominees.</comment>

<comment>In 1992, Senator Joe Biden said a sitting president shouldn't nominate anyone to the Supreme Court during the throes of a political season and presidential campaign.</comment>

<comment>To paraphrase Yoda, "There is no said, only did."</comment>

<comment>For a vacancy and nominee that didn't exist.  But good on you for getting revenge for the ghost Justice.</comment>

<comment>They established that as the precedent. That's their fault.</comment>

<comment>Saying stuff doesn't establish precedent.  Doing stuff does.</comment>

<comment>The banter establishes precedent.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't.  Just like Republicans posturing that they would default on the national debt doesn't actually establish precedent for defaulting on the national debt.</comment>

<comment>Sure it does.</comment>

<comment>Man, these trolls are getting more and more idiotic by the day.</comment>

<comment>Remember when Democrats were so upset because Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid routinely stopped debate and prevented votes in the Senate, and stopped any amendments from being offerred?Yeah, me neither.</comment>

<comment>That's different because Democrats</comment>

<comment>Remember when politicians were political - yeah we all do.  But this is unprecedented.</comment>

<comment>Nope. There's an established precedent from Schumer and Biden.</comment>

<comment>Except for the fact that neither of them were ever Senate majority leader, and Democrats never refused to holding hearings, and no vote was denied to any SCOTUS nominee..But yeah individual Senators engage in political posturing... "I believe that a heavy burden must be met by those who would have this nominee rejected. Under the Constitution, our duty is to provide advice and consent to judicial nominations, not to substitute our judgement for what are reasonable views for a judicial nominee to hold.""The framers intended for three separate and independent branches of government. The judiciary was to be free from political influences, insulated from the whims of a changing majority and answerable only to the law and a public that expected the judicial branch to dispense justice free from the taint of popular politics. Any attempt to deny confirmation on the basis of a philosophy, that is within the mainstream of American political and judicial thought, is an assault on this tripartite structure of government. It is clear under our form of government that the advice and consent role of the Senate in judicial nominations should not be politicized.""There are few duties more consequential for a Member of the U.S. Senate than to vote on a Supreme Court nominee."Guess who said that?</comment>

<comment>Couldn't care less who said it.The Democrats established this as the banter for SCOTUS, and they'e now mad when it's returned.Poor babies.</comment>

<comment>McConnell.  You obviously only care about perceived hypocrisy some of the time.</comment>

<comment>To be honest, it's not hypocrisy. It's a game that the Democrats wrote the rules for.You're just mad the Republicans are finally playing.</comment>

<comment>This is a gift to the Democrats. </comment>

<comment>You mean the people who don't know who Scalia was? Lol. This is a gift to the Republican base.</comment>

<comment>Republicans have been playing the game since Clinton was elected.</comment>

<comment>This game dates back to Reagan.Enjoy.</comment>

<comment>Which Reagan nominee didn't get a vote?</comment>

<comment>Ah yes, your circular logic again.</comment>

<comment>We're just asking for a vote.</comment>

<comment>No, You're asking for a confirmation. Which is why it won't happen.</comment>

<comment>No we're just asking for a vote and Republicans have a 4 member majority so what's the problem?</comment>

<comment>You want a confirmation.That's the problem.Which is why they're not going to consider anyone.</comment>

<comment>You're really making it look like the only way you can prove a point is by pretending like other people are always lying about what they want.</comment>

<comment>It's a pretty simple thing to do, considering Democrats always lie.</comment>

<comment>And..more evidence of your intellectual dishonesty. Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Not at all. Simply telling you why Obama won't get a confirmation.</comment>

<comment>We just want a vote.   Are you beginning to see why the current Republican position is untenable yet?</comment>

<comment>Nope. You want a confirmation.Sorry. Not happening.</comment>

<comment>So vote not to confirm.</comment>

<comment>No thanks.</comment>

<comment>Why?Why is the idea of voting so bothersome to you?</comment>

<comment>Conservatives don't trust Republicans which is why there can be no vote.</comment>

<comment>Has Obama even come up with a nominee yet?</comment>

<comment>Tough question?</comment>

<comment>I don't know. Apparently you couldn't answer it.</comment>

<comment>Oh, you want me to answer why YOU don't want a vote?That seems kinda silly.</comment>

<comment>The question is up there. Do you need me to ask again?</comment>

<comment>I asked a pretty simple question.Why is the idea of voting so bothersome to you? You seem pretty intent that, instead of just voting down a nominee, they shouldn't vote at all.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. They shouldn't vote.</comment>

<comment>I asked why you think that.</comment>

<comment>Obama has to nominate a "moderate", like Sri Srinivasan, who was unanimously confirmed 97 - 0 for his current position if he wants any chance of getting the Senate's to hold a hearing, hold a vote and hopefully approve. If the Senate refuses, it will look very bad for them. Wait until the next President takes office, Trump, Cruz, Rubio or Clinton and you have less "control" over who they submit. Obama is in the hot seat and he has to play ball. Or Mitch and the gang can wait till January 20, 2017, when Hillary nominates Mr Obama; now that I'd love to see, just for the aggravation factor and to watch Mitch's neck go "gobble, gobble, gobble"!</comment>

<comment>Sri Srinivasan was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to the US Court of Appeals, just as Robert Bork was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to the US Court of Appeals.</comment>

<comment>I look forward to Sri defending his time as an Exxon person lol</comment>

<comment>Bork got a vote.</comment>

<comment>Irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>Reagan finally got a nominee approved, Antonin Scalia, who was approved by the Senate by a vote of 98-0 on September 17, 1986, less than two months before election day.</comment>

<comment>"lame-duck president,” McConnell told reportersThat doesn't mean what he thinks it means. Which is unsurprising.</comment>

<comment>That's okay if Democrats take back the Senate, Rubio would be a lame duck President for his entire term.</comment>

<comment>^Increasing the rhetoric? Shocking</comment>

<comment>That's not a threat, that's a promise.  If Republicans prevent Obama from filling that seat, the only way a Republican president is filling it is with a Republican Senate.</comment>

<comment>LOL. Democrats increasing the rhetoric again.</comment>

<comment>No, leave obstructionism to the GOP. They certainly wouldn't approve anyone who wasn't moderate though.</comment>

<comment>I think it is good for the Senate, and in other cases, Congress as a whole, to give the President the middle finger.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely.</comment>

<comment>What would the President need with another middle finger?  Aren't those that he has fully functional?</comment>

<comment>No, the President’s middle fingers are not fully functional. He hasn’t been able to manually stimulate his wife for years. Haven’t you noticed how she scowls in disappointment?Or maybe she’s just naturally ugly.</comment>

<comment>Now if we can get them to ignore everything else we might have a really great remainder of 2016 where at least doesn't doesn't burden us with any new spending or regulations.</comment>

<comment>Good God, there are still people who think the Iran deal was a good thing?Democrats really are stupid.</comment>

<comment>"It is my view that if the president goes the way of Fillmore and Johnson, and presses an election-year nomination, the Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over. ... It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is underway, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over.

<comment>On January 25, 2006, Biden was one of only 24 of the Senate’s 44 Democrats who tried to filibuster Alito. Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Biden — who reneged on an earlier promise to give Alito a vote — were joined by Vermont Independent Senator Jim Jeffords.But please keep whining</comment>

<comment>And Alito was confirmed after a vote.  So let's have a vote.</comment>

<comment>so what?</comment>

<comment>So the Dims aren't getting a nominee. Good luck!</comment>

<comment>Are you saying you agree with everything Joe Biden ever said? Or are you just continuing to be an empty-headed dipshit?</comment>

<comment>I understand you're a cockjuggling thundertwat. However, Obama isn't getting a nominee. So whine more.</comment>

<comment>Gosh you mean the United States will not get a justice?</comment>

<comment>Dims aren't getting a nominee.</comment>

<comment>Do you think the United States should have any judges or other officials at all.</comment>

<comment>Do you like some Straw men, or all Straw men?</comment>

<comment>Since the Republicans are dedicated to smaller government, can you think of a more effective way of reaching that goal than just not allowing any officials to be named?</comment>

<comment>Since your premises are faulty, can you come up with any more outside the scope arguments?</comment>

<comment>Sure.So can you think of a better way to destroy the government the Republicans hate so much than just electing people who refuse to make any appointments?</comment>

<comment>You say that as though government is a good thing.And yet, when it shut down (due to the white house) no one cared or noticed.</comment>

<comment>So we are in agreement. The best way to destroy government would be to elect people who refuse to appoint any officials.</comment>

<comment>Nope</comment>

<comment>What goes around comes around Mitch... or at least it should.  However your dealing with Democrats, and they'll cooperate with the next GOP president (in the unlikely event there ever is one) because they are nice reasonable people and not snot nosed pseudo-fascists like you guys.</comment>

<comment>Jibber Jabber disguised as insight. NICE</comment>

<comment>Screw off muppet</comment>

<comment>The Constitution doesn't really work, that's why we adopted political norms.  When you start to break the norms around the Constitution, you tend to hobble the ordinary functioning of government.  I hope its worth it.</comment>

<comment>Republicans have been chucking norms since Clinton was elected.  For 200 years, we managed to fund the government without repeated shut downs.  For 200 years, a sitting president never sat through a deposition while in office.  It's only gotten worse under Obama.Democrats need to make Republicans pay a heavy political price for doing so.  They have mixed results so far.  Letting Republicans win the 2014 midterms because of ISIS Ebola zombies crossing the southern border, after the last shut down, was discouraging.</comment>

<comment>I love how Democrats actually think this is an issue. One, Democrats don't know who Scalia was.Two, the SCOTUS can have an even number. It's okay. Really.Three, this is bait. I hope Obama takes it.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like Scalia should have stepped down long ago:DALLAS (AP) — Antonin Scalia suffered from coronary artery disease, obesity and diabetes, among other ailments that probably contributed to the justice's sudden death, according to a letter from the Supreme Court's doctor.</comment>

<comment>Hi, I'm your friendly Republican representative and I just chucked the Constitution overboard because it no longer suited my agenda.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution doesn't guarantee nine justices.</comment>

<comment>No, but it guarantees that a vacancy should get  a nomination from the executive and consideration from the Senate.</comment>

<comment>Republicans are doing their job.Proud of them.</comment>

<comment>How will you feel when they refuse to appoint any judges at all? After all these are the people who want to shrink the government until it is small enough to drown in the bathtub.</comment>

<comment>Oh they'll appoint judges. They're just doing what the Dims do with the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>Really when did that happen? Are you imagining things?</comment>

<comment>It's already been discussed ad nauseam. Moron.</comment>

<comment>So you really cannot tell me when the Senate ever refused to meet to consider a nominee of any sort.</comment>

<comment>Already discussed it ad nauseam.</comment>

<comment>So you got nothing. It has never happened before.</comment>

<comment>Except for all of the times it has.Moving along.Hasta Luego, Troll!</comment>

<comment>So tell me when it happened before. If you can.</comment>

<comment>Zipper got your tongue?</comment>

<comment>"... they might have some hope of influencing whomever might be offered the job."It used to be that people who wrote for public consumption knew some grammar, but the use of "who" and "whom", in particular, is now perfectly random.</comment>

<comment>"On January 25, 2006, Biden was one of only 24 of the Senate’s 44 Democrats who tried to filibuster Alito. Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Biden — who reneged on an earlier promise to give Alito a vote — were joined by Vermont Independent Senator Jim Jeffords."Love those Democrats.Always the Double Standard.</comment>

<comment>You know how we know that - because they had a vote.   So have a vote.</comment>

<comment>A vote to filibuster. LOL.We're just avoiding that.</comment>

<comment>As you noted, 20 Democratic Senators refused to filibuster the nomination and Alito was confirmed.  So let's have a vote.</comment>

<comment>Let's have a nominee then.</comment>

<comment>You're going to get one don't worry.</comment>

<comment>And there won't be hearings.Don't worry.</comment>

<comment>Fine vote without the hearings but give the President and up or down vote.</comment>

<comment>No thanks.He doesn't deserve their time.Submit a nominee.Good luck getting a vote.</comment>

<comment>The vote there was to cut off debate, which passed.  No filibuster.</comment>

<comment>"Apples/Oranges."At least Alito got a hearing and a vote. Today Repugs (whoops) Repubs say no hearing, no vote.Wonder why? Would a vote show how truly obstructionist they are?</comment>

<comment>Right, so because the Democrats FAILED, that makes it okay?Nice talking point, Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Your reply makes no sense. As does the rest of your rhetoric. You talk just like your pic -- nonsense. You'll see.Discussion ended.</comment>

<comment>I'd run too if I were you. You can't defend a double standard.</comment>

<comment>Republicans are being stupid. They should have told Obama: "if you nominate a strict originalist who will fill the void left by Scalia, we'll hold hearings and consider them." That's a principled position to take, but still one that Obama almost certainly wouldn't be able to meet them on.</comment>

<comment>Or give Obama the names of 10 GOP-approved judges from which to select. Or hold a vote on Obama's inevitable pick and vote him/her down on principled reasons. Make a show of it. This is a gift to the Democrats. </comment>

<comment>The only thing Scalia was 'originalist' about was coming up with 'original' interpretations of clauses in ways that bypassed precedents and original understandings.He was an activist judge who railed about judicial activism. Yet, he ruled that there was nothing in the Constitution that limited the right of government to execute a wrongfully convicted person, as long as the 'law' had been followed in originally finding him guilty. And, his interpretation in Citizen's United effectively gave the wealthy a megaphone and special rights that ordinary persons do not have. Corporations are tools, not persons.</comment>

<comment>"The only thing Scalia was 'originalist' about was coming up with 'original' interpretations of clauses in ways that bypassed precedents and original understandings."Spot on, so true, and that great point is about to get stolen.  ;)</comment>

<comment>;-)</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court will do just fine with eight justices for a few months. There's no rule that you have to have 9 justices- the Constitution leaves it up to Congress to decide. Now, in effect, Congress is so deciding.</comment>

<comment>The danger of course is that Congress may decide this way for a decade until we're left with five justices on the Court.</comment>

<comment>I don't think we're there yet. I won't rule out that someday our politics might become that dysfunctional, but until there are 40 Ted Cruzes in the Senate, even a President Sanders will get to nominate someone next year.</comment>

<comment>Assuming Democrats retake the Senate, and a Republican wins the White House, why would they allow a Republican president to fill that seat?</comment>

<comment>Because there's not even a shred of reasoning to do so? The "don't nominate someone right before an election" rule has some superficial plausibility and arguable precedents. "Never let a president ever nominate anyone" is absurd.</comment>

<comment>It's absurd but this is the Republican party we are talking about. They are rewriting the book on absurd. Have been for at least 10 years.</comment>

<comment>They only act absurd right before an election. In 2017 they'll calm down.</comment>

<comment>We can hope. We can pray. I'll believe it when I see it.</comment>

<comment>I would have liked to have seen them reach a compromise center-right candidate, but that didn't seem likely on either side. Oh well, this won't be the iceberg that sinks the USS Constitution.</comment>

<comment>No, they have acted ABSURD for the last 8 years. Did you forget them shutting down the government? They have obstructed everything the POTUS has tried to do.</comment>

<comment>Fair point, but the gov't shutdown was driven by the House, not the Senate, thanks to the baleful influence of Ted Cruz. The Senate is the one that confirms justices.</comment>

<comment>Put the shoe on the other foot, if a Democratic controlled Senate held a seat open for an entire year, and Republicans won back control, would they let a Democratic President fill that seat?</comment>

<comment>I think they would eventually reach a compromise candidate. Public interest dies down right after the election and that's when things tend to get done.</comment>

<comment>Once institutional norms are broken, they tend to stay broken.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but it's a step by step process. Democrats and Republicans have recently been filibustering each other's judicial nominees much more than before, but it's not like right after the first time one was filibustered ALL nominees got filibustered.If this works, we'll likely see a new unwritten norm that presidents don't get to replace justices in their last year in office. Not a great norm to follow, but still several steps away from blocking ALL SCOTUS appointments forever.</comment>

<comment>But there's nothing really special about the last year.  That's just an arbitrary and opportunistic distinction.  At the end of the day, Republicans are making a political power play for that seat.  I can't think of a good reason, unless there were considerable concessions offered, why Democrats wouldn't do the same.</comment>

<comment>Well I don't know if we can bridge our gap here- I'd say that the election year brings in special considerations to most people's minds. I'll guess we'll find out though in a few months. Have a good night- it was a pleasure having a discussion without any trolls interrupting.</comment>

<comment>YeaOf course that will happen LOL</comment>

<comment>Whoever Obama nominates will not shift the court "for a generation." The other Justices are all pretty elderly, and several more will be retiring over the next several years.Shift the court for a session or two? Sure. But the next president, whoever it may be, will get to make a couple of nominations, too, no matter what happens this term. And if the balance is 5-4, nominating a new Justice or two could "shift" things yet again.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. I don't even know what the huge fuss is about. Not even a liberal leaning court is going to render the Second Amendment moot. You aren't putting gays back in the closet. Not even a conservative leaning court will criminalize abortion, especially not with Zika breathing down our necks. Religious liberty cases will have to be hashed out slowly and to no one's complete satisfaction, regardless of the makeup of the court, free exercise of religion will not be impinged.Take a deep breath, and confirm Obama's pick. You'll get the next two if you win the White House. If you refuse, and you lose the White House, the Dems might get the next three. Choose wisely.</comment>

<comment>The Do-Nothing Senate is again doing nothing. Big surprise, huh?Hey Senators: the public did decide who will replace Scalia, back in 2012. Remember that election? They rejected Romney and voted for Obama. Now you are trying to renege on your deal and duty. Cowards.Stuff like this is why foreigners laugh at America.Maybe we can impeach Mitch McConnell.</comment>

<comment>Right out of the Reid playbook </comment>

<comment>This is just another example that Republicans purpose in congress is to shut down the government and not obey the laws.</comment>

<comment>There's no rule that you have to have 9 justices- the Constitution leaves it up to Congress to decide how many. Now, in effect, Congress is so deciding.</comment>

<comment>That is 'SPIN' and you know it.</comment>

<comment>republicans once again cower in fear when faced by the simple democratic process of voting</comment>

<comment>Harry taught them well</comment>

<comment>Stupid Republicans.You show your cards right up front, and you handed President Obama and Hillary Clinton a "can't lose" situation.Republicans are absolutely useless in government.</comment>

<comment>HuhWhat part of Dont approve don't you get He'll nominate a lib loon</comment>

<comment>I don't know what your mangled post is supposed to mean. Are you representing the stupidity of Republicans? If so, you are doing a great job.</comment>

<comment>Lib loons won't get approved Are you retarded ?What don't you understand </comment>

<comment>You posted "Huh What part of Dont approve don't you get He'll nominate a lib loon".Barely coherent, with no punctuation."retarded" ..... HA HA HA HA ... amazing irony ....No wonder Republicans are too stupid to know when they handed President Obama and Hillary Clinton a "can't lose" situation.</comment>

<comment>TardKeep posting You are a champion of the mentally challenged </comment>

<comment>Thanks for proving the stupidity of Republicans for the 3rd time.</comment>

<comment>Tard squared keep going </comment>

<comment>Thanks for proving the stupidity of Republicans for the 4th time.</comment>

<comment>Your point is it's stupid to oppose ObamaYea right That's such a great point really Sarc </comment>

<comment>Thanks for proving the stupidity of Republicans for the 5th time.</comment>

<comment>You have no point </comment>

<comment>Thanks for proving the stupidity of Republicans for the 6th time.</comment>

<comment>Oh well, "tard squared".   Now he's brought math into it...</comment>

<comment>Yep. Oh well.</comment>

<comment>I'm a champion of the mentally challenged also. There is a home down the street from me where a dozen or so very fine young people are cared for by some very compassionate and dedicated people. I admire them. You suck.</comment>

<comment>Nice picture I guess if being dumb is compassionate you got it all </comment>

<comment>Now I understand why your thoughts are so incoherent. You can't read.</comment>

<comment>You have no point</comment>

<comment>Can't think. Can't read. Can't spell.Edit: Oh, changed "pint" to "point". Keyboard challenged also.</comment>

<comment>Well he called you a "tard" below.  If I remember my third grade recess logic right, he automatically wins and you have to kiss one of the girls.  You know, I fully expect Trump to call Hillary a harpy or something during their debates.  And that guy will figure Trump won.</comment>

<comment>The stupidity of Republicans is only overshadowed by the stupidity of Republican voters.</comment>

<comment>Most of them aren't stupid.  Some are really angry but I can't figure out why.  Most just want small government.  And it's a shame that we don't have a party that can articulate that in a way that doesn't sound angry because America needs real dialog.  In 8 years they've gone from an honorable American hero to a choice between a robot, a religious zealot and a rank demagogue. America deserves better.</comment>

<comment>Republican voters are dumb as a bag of hammers. Half of them ignore how corrupt the Republican party is, and the other half want to turn the Republican party into a joke.Republicans have never been honorable in my lifetime. Nixon left office in disgrace. Reagan pretended he didn't know anything about Iran/Contra, while he more than doubled the National Debt. GHW Bush seemed honorable, but he was a lousy communicator. The Republican Congress during Clinton's term were hypocrites of epic proportions. The Republicans during the Dubya years doubled the National Debt,  and they tarnished America's reputation by having NO war/occupation strstegy, and they tortured prisoners. Republicans since Obama came into office have zero leadership skills.Americans do deserve better than corrupt Democrats and corrupt Republicans. </comment>

<comment>I guarantee you he's lying and Obama will have Crazy Eyed Loretta in there before he leaves office.</comment>
