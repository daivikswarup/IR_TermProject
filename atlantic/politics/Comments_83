<comment>So Scalia was the only one at that White House correspondents dinner whose sense of humor was representative of the rest of the country.</comment>

<comment>To me, that says a lot.</comment>

<comment>No. Compared to Norm MacDonald's quirky jabs at Bill and Hill, Colbert was just kind of sad and flat.</comment>

<comment>Oh look, an article that doesn't trash Scalia.How nice.</comment>

<comment>The Scalia bashing stopped as soon as his heart did.  It will be months before anyone publishes anything bad about him.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps in the US.  In the UK, the science crowd are already giving his body a kick to check if he's faking.  Death of Justice Antonin Scalia may shift US climate change lawsThe sub-text of the article is this one death may save millions.  Spock -“Don’t grieve, Admiral. It is logical. The needs of the many outweigh . . .” Kirk - “The needs of the few.” Spock - “Or the one.”</comment>

<comment>Some people can have toxic political views and still be pleasant and fun to be around....Scalia strikes me as that type of person. It's the people that constantly have to let their views be known, no matter how misguided or ignorant they are, they are the ones that on a personal level become somewhat unbearable.</comment>

<comment>You certainly wouldn't get very far arguing that Scalia was ignorant.I think you meant to say was, from what you could see you disagreed with him on many issues.Don't count out the possibility that you may not have understood where he was coming from (if comments on this site are indicative of what many may have thought he said or meant.</comment>

<comment>I didn't call him ignorant, I said certain people have ignorant opinions and constantly voice them as a contrast to the type of person Scalia seemed to be...thanks for completely misreading my comment though....although a lot of Scalia's decisions and statements that he's made were really questionable...especially pertaining to black and gay people.</comment>

<comment>thanks for the clarification, sorry for the misinterpretation.  My anti-troll trigger was set on hair.</comment>

<comment>Antonin Scalia, closeted human being.</comment>

<comment>All these nice things being said about Justice Scalia are all well and good but at the end of the day he was pulling for GOP interests in his decision making. So it's no wonder GOP don't want to see anyone other than a conservative justice replace him. All this garbage about letting the American people decide on the next appointment is pure crap. The American people already decided that by electing President Obama twice he is the voice of the American people! The GOP's great hero Reagan was in the same position as President Obama and appointed a justice but of course that was perfectly alright because he was a Republican president. What a bunch of hypocrites.</comment>

<comment>Reagan was not in the same position at all. Justice Powell retired from the court well over a year in advance of the next election. Justice Kennedy was the 3rd nominee on top of that, and still nominated a year out (are you familiar with the term getting "Borked"?).Justice Scalia did not make decisions in accordance with GOP interests, he interpreted the Constitution to his best understanding, and voted/wrote accordingly.  If only the GOP were more in line with that, they'd be a party to support.Cases of election year nominations have only been for vacancies over a year out. You would have to go back many decades to find an exception.</comment>

<comment>"Many decades"Only because there have been so few examples, which isn't surprising when there is only one vacancy every 4 years or so. There has never been a time when a vacancy has been purposely unfilled because it was an election year. While the OP is incorrect about Reagan, one only needs to look to Ike recess appointing William Brennan because of the feeling that any vacancy should at least be attempted to be filled.Face it, it looks terrible for the GOP to have tried to get ahead of a Obama announcement and say he shouldn't even try to appoint a new justice. They would have been better off keeping their collective mouths shut and then voting down any Obama nomination on whatever grounds they wanted.</comment>

<comment>So if we take William Brennan, "a leader of the Court's liberal wing" (wiki description) in 1956, that would be 60 years ago. I am very certain that qualifies as "many decades", since that is more than halfway to a "century".  He was then put for confirmation hearings the very next year, where he was confirmed.  I think that supports my claim that election year appointments are the exception, not a rule.  Even in this case, a recess appointment still gave an opportunity for the next congress to vote him down.With that, I'm going to have to agree with you on the GOP approach. Simply saying they would never even look at or consider a nomination feels completely wrong. They should have said they would handle things as they come up. When Obama nominated a left wing activist, they should vote he/she on their merits, after adequate deliberation.</comment>

<comment>No, you're missing the point. Every time there's been a chance to appoint a Justice in the last year of a President's term, they have done so. The number of years since it's happened is immaterial, because it's just so rare for a Supreme Court slot to open up. There have literally been zero times that a President has left a slot open without at least trying to nominate someone.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the Democrats bear blame for setting precedent with Bork.Yes, I support President Obama putting up a nominee on his own timetable, and I support the Senate holding confirmation hearings.  And if that nominee fails to get confirmed, getting another nominee and a third (that would take us into the summer recess).If there's no precedent (many decades, etc) another precedent can be set now.  My opinion, not movable by debate on a forum, of course subject to the judgment of trolls, opposing viewpoints, etc.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, and I understand your perspective. I think the Senate should of course be willing to deliberate, and give advice and consent on any nominee Obama puts up. I'm simply saying that opposed to what Sen. Schumer and others are saying, the Senate has no requirement to simply pass through any nominee the President makes (as he himself said in Bush's last year in office).</comment>

<comment>More silly cart before the horse drivel..Scalia, made legal decisions based on how he saw the Constitution and how cases related to the Constitution.It just happens that the Conservatives including those in the GOP happen to view things in the same light.IN the last 2 elections, the American people also filled the Congress with more republicans. Also across the Country they filled governorships and State legislatures with Republicans in large numbersAt best, you can claim that Obama got back in the last time because he was the incumbent and not real challenger was presented by the GOP.But that does NOT negate what happened everywhere else.</comment>

<comment>Obama got back in because he was smart and he was wanted the American people wanted for a second term. Romney was as dull as ditch water and had to sing America The Beautiful to try and impress! Well that worked out well for him. Congress and around the country filled with more GOP and look at what a useless bunch of jerks those in Congress have turned out to be! GOP governors useless as well. Christie and bridge gate. Snyder and Watergate. Both claim to be such great governors yet neither knew what was going on in their state. What load of hogwash that was.</comment>

<comment>More silly cant, with added cherry-picked examples.</comment>
