<comment>Terrorism, workplace violence - let's just call it evil.</comment>

<comment>Then the next thing you know we have "evil doers" and we are invading Pakistan or something equally dumb.</comment>

<comment>You misunderestimate the strategery of evil doers.</comment>

<comment>How about just keeping the Pakis out? We don't invade them, they don't come here.  </comment>

<comment>3/4 of all gas stations in America will close.</comment>

<comment>Why don't we let blacks own them, they will have something to work.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Also keep the Hoosiers out since this murderer was one.</comment>

<comment>Ok, evil.</comment>

<comment>Things can get really ugly really fast once the government defines and legislates the label, "EVIL"... within a single election cycle we'd have laws outlining the "evil" of burning American flags (or not standing in salute to its presence), disputing commands from police officers, Public dissent to elected officials, non-compliance to the "religious freedoms" of select denominations, etc., etc., etc.......  Punishments for acts of "evil" will be swift and harsh...I can live with bureaucratic, semantic wishy-washiness when it comes to federal justice system defining acts of mass violence. When the US government gets into the practice of declaring "evil", I'm building a bunker and starting to collect canned food and MREs... :)</comment>

<comment>"arriba65" probably wasn't seriously suggesting the U.S. govt call it "evil", it was probably just trying to throw up dust.If someone can't add all the circumstances together - the tactical clothing, the weapons, the rented car, the large number of bombs, the visits to S.A. and Pakistan, etc. etc. - and be willing to call this terrorism, then that person clearly isn't credible. If white Protestants did this, Obama/CNN/The Atlantic/etc would be using the word "terrorism" every 10 seconds.</comment>

<comment>This may very well turn out to be terrorism.  But as far as you know as of right now, exactly how was this person trying to intimidate or coerce the government or population?  What action were they trying to change?  You don't know.  You can guess, but at least call it that.  As opposed to the Planned Parenthood shooter who wanted "no more baby parts", we do not know, yet.</comment>

<comment>The Planned Parenthood terrorist wasn't...so why are you STILL whining?</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Muslim killers, Christian killers, at the end of the day there is zero we can do about it until we address our gun problem. </comment>

<comment>Nonsense. Gun control only prohibits law abiding citizens from arming themselves because they wouldn't break the law. Criminals (and terrorists), who by definition operate outside the law and in violation of it, don't care what the law is; they'll find a way to arm themselves while the rest of us are defenseless. The problem is the person, not the weapon.Britain implemented strict gun control, disarming its people. And, yes, their gun crime is almost nonexistent. Their knife crime, however, is off the charts. They now have a national debate about banning, listen to this, sharp and pointy knives. They are a prime example of not focusing on what the problem really is.</comment>

<comment>The guy in San Bernadino was a "law-abiding citizen" who got his guns legally.</comment>

<comment>True. Do you know how the Paris terrorists managed to get their guns and explosives? Both are illegal in France. </comment>

<comment>Outside connections, most likely. Probably not too difficult considering the global trade in black market weapons.</comment>

<comment>Hmm, so your point about them getting their guns legally was...?I thought you were implying that they wouldn't have had access to guns had they been illegal. </comment>

<comment>Some guns used in Paris attacks produced in ex-Yugoslavia's arsenal | Reuters http://www.reuters.com/article...Paris attacks explosive is easy to make and very unstable - Business Insider http://uk.businessinsider.com/...</comment>

<comment>Steve, it was a rhetorical question not a quiz. The point is that making guns and explosives illegal will not prevent a determined person from obtaining them.BTW, I am in favor of moderate gun control laws, laws more stringent that we have now. I also think the government should do a much better job of enforcing the laws and the processes we already have in place.</comment>

<comment>Yes. The killing of 14 and wounding of 17 proves he was very law-abiding.</comment>

<comment>He was indeed law-abiding up until that point, my clueless little friend.EDIT - in case you haven´t figured it out yet, I was poking fun at the NRA´s simple-minded "law-abiding citizens" meme.</comment>

<comment>Violent crime and homicide is much lower in the UK than in the US.</comment>

<comment>The US has more than double the population of the UK.</comment>

<comment>Crime per person.</comment>

<comment>Bullshit.</comment>

<comment>Christian killer? Huh? Why not throw Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish and atheist in as well?Are you aware that both guns and high explosives are illegal in France? Are you under the illusion that Islamic terrorists care about our gun laws?Nothing you said after Muslim killers made a lick of sense. </comment>

<comment>No. There is zero we can do until we address the idiot problem. Idiots who think outlawing law abiding citizens owning guns will solve our TERRORIST problem. Secure our borders, you know, a REAL solution... That would be awesome.</comment>

<comment>No. Lets call it what it is.This is no time to take a feelings inventory, it is time to demand responsibility from our government for THEIR actions.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Or religious. </comment>

<comment>In my experience, I have found that religious terrorism isn't very distinct from political terrorism. Consider Catholics and protestants in Ireland for example.</comment>

<comment>The conflict was not a Catholic/Protestant problem, it was an English/Irish problem.  The Irish did not want to be governed by the British.   As much as some people would like to believe that it was a religious conflict, religion was not a factor.  The only religious connection was one of coincidence, Irish are typically Catholic and the British are typically Protestants.</comment>

<comment>Speaking as a person who is of Irish decent, whose family was involved in the troubles and the fight for independence before that, to ignore the place of religion in the cycles of violence in Ireland is frankly wrong.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and all decent people, Irish or not, should agree with you --- Erin go bragh!</comment>

<comment>tiocfaidh ár lá</comment>

<comment>One of my Irish ancestors left Listravanich in 1798; whether before or after the rebellion associated with Wolfe Tone I don't know. I don't read/speak Erse, though.</comment>

<comment>Who fucking cares??? This isnt what the discussion is about, moron.</comment>

<comment>Ah, another self-appointed Littler Hitler online, who cannot even follow the most mundane connections between ideas --- keep up the good work!   Edit: I see that one of your 153 or so comments ends with "Die, Grammar Nazi!" ---- I rest my case, ladies and gentlemen.</comment>

<comment>What does that mean? </comment>

<comment>"Our time will come"</comment>

<comment>The conflict in Northern Ireland was political, not religious. Same too the Israeli/Palestinian conflict. Just because you're of Irish decent doesn't mean a thing.</comment>

<comment>Sure. Ignoring the fact that my Irish Catholic relatives would have happily seen every Protty die. Other than that, religion not at all an issue.</comment>

<comment>Both conflicts were and remain BOTH political and religious; the two are deeply intertwined. Deny this, and you don't understand what fuels the conflict.</comment>

<comment>Yeah no Tom59 scores 10/10 on the porky pie meter. Have to wonder whether he actually believes the utter nonsense he just wrote.</comment>

<comment>And the Protestant northern Irish didn't want to be governed by the Catholics, which inevitably they would be in a 32 county country.</comment>

<comment>No you are wrong.  Catholic and Protestants in Ireland itself live in two different districts and they have almost walled off each other.</comment>

<comment>As an Irish Catholic decendent, you're on crack if you think that wasn't and isn't a religious war as well as sovereignty question. Or as my grandmother would say to you if she was still alive, "burn in hell Protty scum!"</comment>

<comment>Without the fight for sovereignty, there would have been no fight.  Religion was something to hold onto, but it was not the reason anyone was fighting.</comment>

<comment>Religion is often used as a (thin) veil for political gain. Look at Pope Urban II's Crusades. Classic example.</comment>

<comment>In the case of Islamism, there's no distinction between the two. The separation of Church and State is a Western, Enlightenment invention.</comment>

<comment>my, how advanced and modern you must feel</comment>

<comment>Church and State were separate power centers in Medieval Europe too. But Mosque and state were never separate in the Islamic world.</comment>

<comment>Religion is political.</comment>

<comment>Islamism is political.</comment>

<comment>Islam itself is political. It is a religion born of conquest and governance. Dar al Islam, dar al Harb and all that.</comment>

<comment>No, no it isn't. Islam spread through trade, and took Arabic with it as the language of trade.</comment>

<comment>Religion IS political. Every religion has a spiritual side (prayer, ritual, belief in higher power), a political side (rules of behavior and conduct or laws), and a social side (instruction on one's place in society and relationships). Without the political and social elements, it wouldn't be religion at all; it would just be faith or deism.</comment>

<comment>Solid supplementary information. Can't argue with that at all.</comment>

<comment>Islam spread through trade only after it finished spreading through conquest.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Incorrect. Absolutely incontrovertibly wrong. There were very, very limited inter-tribal skermishes in the Arabian peninsula pre-7th century, and afterwards Islam became the uniting factor through trade. Yes there were small battles and wars, but there was no single (or even fractured) conquest that ever occurred. Before you argue, please just do some research, and for the love of GOD, make them academicic sources. Like I did when  I got my degree IN THIS EXACT SUBJECT. So chill.</comment>

<comment>"Islam spread through trade" --- sure, sure it did.    {Edges cautiously away}</comment>

<comment>Okay bruh I mean my only source on this is my university degree on the subject but yeah man. Do you have a degree in Arabic and Islamic Studies? Did you ever live in the middle east? Yeah didn't think so.</comment>

<comment>Clearly, historical reasoning is not your strength. The formulation you offer is roughly akin to claiming that one characteristic of a historical phenomenon {"the spread of Islam"} can be assigned tout court to only one of its manifestations, "trade."  Naturally once Islamic influence was spread through conquest and concurrent genocide and ongoing genocide, trade was part of the package. It is a reductionistic blunder of the first order to claim that, "therefore," Islam spread via trade.  Do you see why?     No, I'm afraid your university degree is entirely worthless in that respect, and you should demand at least a partial refund of your tuition, part of which you could then use to obtain a copy of HISTORIAN'S FALLACIES: TOWARD A LOGIC OF HISTORICAL THOUGHT by D.H. Fischer. When you have done so, read Chapter VI , "Fallacies of Causation," specifically, "Reductive Fallacies."   Buena Suerte, mi amigo!P.S. New copies of Fischer's classic opus are available online new for around $8.72 and used for a mere $.80. plus shipping and handling, so off you go to educate yourself, Luis!</comment>

<comment>What in the hell are you talking about? What genocides?? Please provide some sort of link to an academic source describing this genocide you speak of. My university - consistently one of the top 20 in the world - doesn't just hand out degrees for fun. Also, it's "amigo mio", not "mi amgo". How do I know? Ah yes, my degree in the subject, and having lived in Spanish speaking countries for many years and speaking it fluently. I'm just being an ass right now but you're an idiot so I'm going to be a prick about it.</comment>

<comment>And where do you get this gibberish about `mi amigo' being somehow incorrect Spanish?     Your incessant babbling about the high quality of your education looks increasingly dubious, as well as being tedious.   El que nace para maceta del corredor no pasa.</comment>

<comment>I replied to this but it was deleted, probably because I used some very gentle profanity. I'm not going to type out what I said again because this whole argument is stupid, but suffice to say that I'll bet you any money you can't find one academically reviewed source that discusses this "genocide" you're talking about. And a university degree from a university that is consistently ranked top 20 in the world isn't worthless, buddy. Good luck with your kook theories bruh.</comment>

<comment>Google is your friend! Try (I'm improvising this on the spot) something along the lines of "Islam spread by genocide" and go from there. You could also pose the question, "How on earth did the countries in the former Eastern Roman Empire like Egypt with its Christian Copts, not to mention Judea and the rest of what is now Israel, end up with a population practicing Islam, WITHOUT both violent genocide and cultural genocide and suppression?"     The idea that Islam spread into INDIA without this occurring is also completely absurd, which is why your alleged degree seems highly dubious and/or marked by astonishing lacunae. Good luck with your palpably absurd attempts to rewrite history, Luis!   Now to see what happens when you search "Islam spread by genocide"  --- you could use Bing or other search tools as well, of course....</comment>

<comment>Quick update --- as I suspected, the first account is headlined:       ISLAMIC INVASION OF INDIA: THE GREATEST GENOCIDE IN HISTORY,evidently using the adjective "greatest" in the sense of "Is Charles Manson the greatest American psychopathic criminal?"  or "Were the Nazi medical experiments the greatest assault on the Hippocratic Oath in human history"? etc.       Case closed, Luis. Being a scholar of the subject and being a willing apologist/dupe are two different things.</comment>

<comment>Bro please just stop. I looked up that website called "the muslim Issue" (which is run by wordpress, i.e. NOT an academic source), and these are just SOME of their stated goals on their website:Encourage a total ban on Islamic immigrationEncourage the end of asylum policies.Encourage reversal of residency and citizenship to actively practicing Islamic migrants.soo yeah, you get your info from a very very overtly racist website with no academically reviewed information, and I get mine from four years of one of the highest ranking universities in the world. Have a nice one, man, I won't be responding again, now that I've won the argument thanks to your extremely unreliable source info.</comment>

Have a nice one, man, I won't be responding again, now that I've won the argument thanks to your extremely unreliable source info.</comment>

<comment>Also: you don't understand the `Genetic Fallacy,' either --- look it up.     One phrase that summons it up: "Some things are true, even if George W. Bush says they are true."        It matters no one bit who states a true proposition as to the truth of that proposition.        I only quoted the headline, having no idea who formulated it, but it's clear there was a genocidal invasion which finally led to August 15, 1947 and the partition into Pakistan and India centuries later. The Islamic invasion of France repelled by the forces under Charles Martel, the Reconquista expelling the invasion of Spain, the battle at the gates of Vienna, it's a long list. There's not one single example EVER of Islam "spreading through trade" as its main mode of transmission --- the massacres began while Mohammed was still alive, after all!</comment>

<comment>Sigh, I replied to this but again, it was deleted. Really not sure why. Anyway, the key points were:a) that headline was written in an article published by a wordpress website that is not academic nor has any peer-reviewed material on it.b) that same website has a stated goal of removing US citizenship from, and deporting all muslims from the United States. Not what I'd call un-baised material.c) I won't respond to you again because you get your information from racist websites and I have a four year degree on the subject from one of the top universities in the world.And, just for fun, I asked you to find "academic, peer reviewed" articles/books/information on this "muslim genocide". And you still haven't done that. So the case is indeed closed, but was ruled in my favour.</comment>

<comment>No, you have the burden of proof in showing that somehow Islam conquered India via trade, you impossible simpleton. You made the original ludicrous claim that `Islam spread through trade,'  and there are plenty of academic studies of the history of Islamic invasions which refute that nonsense.  Try "History of the Mogul Empire" and go from there.     Next you'll be claiming the genocide of the Armenian Christians at the hands of the Muslim Turks never happened, right?</comment>

<comment>Note also: most religions have at one time or another proceeded to "spread their influence" via conquering territory,  INCLUDING GENOCIDE and various kinds of cultural suppression, whether it was a few hundred square miles as in various Native American traditions (the idea that the Aztecs ended up with their empire because the local tribes agreed to be slaves is absurd, correct?)  or hundreds of thousands or millions of miles , as in the various Christian churches spreading in the Americas. Eventually land disputes are settled by treaties, reparations for past damages, concessions to run businesses like casinos etc. It isn't unique to the spread of Islam nor is it unique to see apologists/dupes denying that it occurred.  Sometimes the locals kick out the invaders, as happened repeatedly in Europe both to invading Christians and invading Muslim armies.       I think you may be a "fake account/Sockpuppet" for some bored teenager who doesn't have any college degrees at all and doesn't speak "fluent Spanish" either.  Buena suerte with that!</comment>

<comment>bruh please stop, you're just rambling. I speak fluent spanish which is my 3rd language. How am I a fake account, though? now you're just reaching. You're boring and not intelligent, so adios, bro!!</comment>

<comment>Right, you invented this bizarre idea that Islam somehow expanded from a relatively tiny area in the north Arabian desert all the way east to the Philippines, through Indonesia, through India, by "trade" rather than the usual methods (conquest, genocide of the conquered, forced conversions etc.) which of course bears zero relation to reality, claim you have a university degree "proving" this insane theory is true and accurate, and make up some nonsense about "mi amigo" being incorrect Spanish (my fourth language, after French and German and of course English), and fail to realize that ANYONE can research the role of Muslims in the African slave trade, the conquest of India aka the Moghul or Mogul Empire, the Armenian genocide, the conquest of Egypt and the rest of North Africa, invasions of Spain, France, Hungary, the Balkans with consequent massacres and notice you are just lying about all of this, and you wonder why I suspect you made up the degree as well?  You're a hoot!   EL que mucho se alaba mucho se deslava, mi amigo!</comment>

<comment>So is Christianity. There is at least one obvious Christian theocracy still in existence--The Vatican. Many nations have deep government ties to Christian churches (Russia, Ukraine, even the UK to some extent.)Look no further than our own history and how Christianity played, and continues to play, a deep role in our national politics. Name a single sitting President who wasn't overtly Christian. Name more than a handful of sitting Congresspersons and Senators that aren't Christian. Polls continue to show that an atheist could not get elected to the presidency here.Politics.</comment>

<comment>Not fundamentally no. Even Medieval Europe made a distinction between church and state. Islam make no such distinction. Everything, and I do mean everything, falls within the authority of the mosque. Most Muslim theologians believe democracy has no place within Islam. Christianity does not prescribe a legal, economic or political system. Not so with Islam.Of course politics and religion get mixed up. People are both religious and political animals. People who run for office come to the job with religious persuasions. People who vote have religious affiliations. That is never going to change. Nor should it change.</comment>

<comment>I find this position hard to reconcile with the assimilation of Muslim Americans into our own political system as well as democratic nations like Bosnia that have a high percentage of Muslim citizens. In Bosnia and Herzegovina, Muslims make up 46% of the population.I found these articles worth reading:http://studies.aljazeera.net/R...http://www.al-islam.org/shia-p...Fundamentalist Islam has no room for democracy. But that doesn't mean a highly religious society cannot form a democracy based on religious principles. (Many, in fact, have.) The larger question is whether it would be what the West would recognize as a "liberal democracy" such as the one in the US.Fundamentalist Christianity would seem to desire the sort of religious-based democracy mentioned in the articles I've quoted.In any event, I've provided examples of Mulsim thought on the matter which counter your contention that "[m]ost Muslim theologians believe democracy has not place within Islam."[As an aside, I would not live in a religious democracy myself, Christian or otherwise. I would emigrate. I'd do that because both Islam and Christianity and Judaism demand the death penalty for LGBT people and I'm not interested in being a martyr for the cause.]</comment>

<comment>Even in "moderate" countries like Turkey, very large percentages of people want sharia law. According to many Muslims, Sharia law is not compatible with democracy as it is considered an affront to Allah's will.</comment>

<comment>I should also say: thanks for the references. I will read them carefully.</comment>

<comment>Islam is a very good tactical warfare doctrine. Just watch how fast that army is spreading around the world, mostly by force</comment>

<comment>In the FBI's and Federal criminal codes opinion as well.</comment>

<comment>I thought the definition of "violence with a political purpose" was "war"</comment>

<comment>Does it have a political motivation?If so, it is terrorism.</comment>

<comment>Because they are teasing the terrorist to try harder ?</comment>

<comment>We all know what real terrorism is.Fecal swastikas and e-mails about Halloween costumes. </comment>

<comment>Darkening your face with make-up and drawing prophets.  Now that's 'real' terrorism. /s</comment>

<comment>I saw Fecal Swastikas open for Public Image Limited back in '84.</comment>

<comment>"I may be black/ I may be white."After reading in the New Republic that saying race shouldn't matter is a "socially conservative" position, I mused about the possibility that by the standards of young people today John Lydon is a social conservative.The past year has really turned me inside out politically.</comment>

<comment>1,500 rounds, assault riffles and semi-automatic handguns, as well as pipe bombs. Dressed in tactical gear. Young Muslim couple dropped off their 6-month-old baby, got dressed in attack gear they already had at home with a legally bought arsenal, packed a rented SUV full of pipe bombs, shot up the govt. center he worked for and was embedded in, then took on SWAT teams and local police while on the run. Murdered 14 people and injured 21 more.This is not workplace violence, Obama.Anyone with a dispute at work shrugs it off, talks it out or walks over to complain at HR.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>I believe he said it could be both things, workplace revenge and terrism. Sounds like you're saying it has to be one or the other.</comment>

<comment>Not at the Post Office.</comment>

<comment>Like for an old joke.</comment>

<comment>Most disputes at the Post Office are handled peacefully. Only the extreme and rare cases of violence at the Post Office make the news. Let's not make it sound like the norm.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, because "going postal" was never a real thing, right?</comment>

<comment>Of course that's how workplace disputes are handled, you haven't heard the expression "going postal"?  As a type of violent behavior it's not all that uncommon. </comment>

<comment>No, Obama thinks this is a nut case / NRA problem.  </comment>

<comment>It's not. It's a gun problem. No guns, no problem.</comment>

<comment>Right, they should have used their bombs instead.  PS  Does it bother you at all looking at those soldiers with their faces blown off?   Or, are you such a left wing pig it makes you happy?</comment>

<comment>Which soldiers?</comment>

<comment>The soldiers who had their faces blown off by IEDs.  Yes that will be here soon with idiot Obama protecting the Muslims.</comment>

<comment>I blame your parents.</comment>

<comment>We all know its Terror. However, legal distinctions need to be made for jurisdictional purposes.  Which court? Which prosecutors?  It matters because the Feds still have the death penalty. Its in the hands of lawyers.  Really, any crime could be Terror, but its a matter of language and distinctions. When Bill Clinton said, "It depends what the definition of is is."  And it might be work place violence. He may have had a beef with a Jewish co-worker.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Easy solution. Ban guns. Problem gone.</comment>

<comment>I agree with your sentiment, but 1500 rounds really isn't that much.</comment>

<comment>Ok...Over 48 hours later and we now know what this is...ENOUGH already...DEAL WITH IT!</comment>

<comment>Preach! No more guns for private citizens! Muslims kill people for political purposes, and Christians kill people for political purposes. The common denominator? They both can easily obtain guns. This isn't a problem begging for a solution, this is a problem with a solution screaming at it!</comment>

<comment>Yes, we should be more like France! Private citizens can't get guns in France, and terrorists can't get guns in Fra--- okay, okay, bad example.</comment>

<comment>Just wait until about 5 more years of shunning. ridiculing, condemning, slandering and demonizing our 12 million fellow muslim americans that work in airports, malls, stadiums, etc... and they decide to sympathize with the radicals...</comment>

<comment>So did you intend to compare the Muslim population to a ticking time bomb?</comment>

<comment>Sorta. Like you being pumped up until you spew hate... causing them to go off... yup</comment>

<comment>Yea, lets let more come here so we can all get blown up.</comment>

<comment>No. Why use bombs when they can easily buy guns? The same is true for our far more prevalent Christian terrorists. Easy solution? No more guns.</comment>

<comment>Jews are the most lied about people and Israel is the most lied about country and thank G-d the Jewish and Israeli response is very different than the Islamic response.  I also thank G-d for rational Muslims who are moral and intellectual academics and write for papers like Gatestone Institute.  There is one article by a brilliant Turkish columnist who more or less address your point with little anecdotes like the Turkish fans in a soccer match did not boo and hiss during the moment of silence for the Paris victims because they are thought of poorly by the West - they did it because they relish the text of Islam and the conditioning that they've been under while the government controls what they can read and say.</comment>

<comment>The Gatestone Institute is a hate group.http://www.thenation.com/artic...http://www.alternet.org/news-a...</comment>

<comment>Point to one fact that any of the journalists of Gatestone reported that is incorrect.  Just one.</comment>

<comment>They falsely tried to claim Fatah was allied with Daesh, just off the topic of my head. Even Netanyahu was not that stupid.</comment>

<comment>Please point to the article that did that - I'd like to see it in context.</comment>

<comment>I don't have it saved. I do not frequent hate sites.I've never seen anything they published that was factual. Link whatever article you'd like. I do not wish to search their site or give them ad dollars.</comment>

<comment>So you can't point to a single fact that you find is incorrect.That is what I thought.</comment>

<comment>BTY - they only hate terrorists.  The journalists there are among the best proponents for the Palestinian people and for peace all around.  They are some of the most knowledgeable that I have come across and I don't say that just because one is a close friend of mine, so I am very aware at how the site validates the legitimacy of every source.  Hence - my confidence in my challenge to you to find an error in a fact on its pages.</comment>

<comment>I just gave you two links that prove otherwise. It's an infamous anti-Muslim group.You also just quoted a "brilliant" journalist well known for his links to far-right groups and anti-Muslim groups, skipping over his well known ideological extremism. He's feted by anti-Muslim and anti-Arab hate groups, no one else.So you're a shill for an anti-Muslim hate group huh? Classy.</comment>

<comment>I have many Muslims friends.  They are not jihadist nor Islamists though -so maybe they don't qualify as Muslim to you.  Again -name ONE fact that Khaled or Gatestone has written that is incorrect.  One.  The links you gave me only suggest that Gatestone is Jihad leery - which is only prudent in today's day in age, as it was 1500 years ago.They speak the truth and use precise facts and all you can do is categorize them as anti-Muslim.  You are dangerously wrong.  But that won't stop you from trying to discredit both.</comment>

<comment>Forget it. you cannot convince people who choose to remain ignorant and blind and choose to embrace hate. Your other comments here prove you embrace hate.</comment>

<comment>Which comments of mine "prove [I] embrace hate."?  Name one or cut and paste a quote from me in context with the rest of what I said.  I'm guessing your'll come up with as many comments to "prove your point" as you've been able to find incorrect facts from Gatestone that "prove your point."Suggestion - stop seeing what isn't there and start actually seeing what is.  And look deep inside yourself.  I'm doubting you have to go deep too be stopped by your own hate - and I'm guessing who that is toward.  But, that is just a hunch -  based on some facts.</comment>

<comment>You embrace lies.  I see you don't want to - and you don't want to embrace hate - yet, you label an upstanding journalist as being anti-Muslim when that is far from the truth.  You haven't pointed out to a single lie that he has said (they don't exist - so you can't) and yet some invisible puppet masters inform you he is no good - and you believe it.  It is sad.  Investigate on your own and think for yourself.  If more people did - we'd all have a lot less problems.And since I didn't hear back from you - I am guessing that you realize that you couldn't find a single hateful comment from me on the article.  I hope that alone opens your eyes and mind.</comment>

<comment>"There is no such thing as Islamophobia as there is no such thing as an irrational fear of Islam - a religion/ideology created by a man who sliced heads off peaceful people while distributing the children of the victims as booty to his gang of theives. Today's jihadists emulate him. It is prudent to fear their collective goal."Right there. But please, live in your own delusional world. Your comments make it abundantly clear that you are utterly incapable of connecting with reality. You live in a political echo chamber.</comment>

<comment>You are very deceitful.  I said in context. You deliberately left off this part:"Muslimophobia would not be a nice thing - an irrational fear of Muslims, many who are good people."Muslims are a people who share a religion.  Islam is an ideology born from what I said.  It is factual and not hateful.</comment>

<comment>The context does not salvage the statement at all. Hating Islam and then saying "but I like Muslims" is a distinction without difference. Ask those Muslims if they feel respected when you spread lies and hate about their faith.</comment>

<comment>I didn't spread one lie.  Is it not true that the prophet of Islam sliced the heads off about 900 peaceful men of the tribe of Banu Qurayza, claimed a victim's wife as his own and distributed the children as slaves among his men?  Is it not true that he took the tribe's wealth.  And now, in that very area, which is called Saudi Arabia, it is illegal to be a citizen who is Jewish or Christian or Atheist?Many Muslims are great people as they reconcile the violent birth of the religion they were conquered into with the good humans they want to be.  Those who practice "pure" Islam as the prophet did, I tend to feel are not good people.  Perhaps you disagree.  That wouldn't' surprise me.Meanwhile - you can't point to one lie I've said, nor point to hate of a people (though an ideology), nor can you find a lie from Khaled Abue Toameh nor Gatestone and yet you use lots of pixels to say we all lie. Khaled and the others like him are super brave.  You seem a little cowardly.  Be truthful - be brave.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps some of your misunderstandings with Nessie are cultural.In the West, non-violence is considered a virtue. All societies are made up of human beings, so none are perfect, but Western societies value the rule of law as opposed to the "revelation of Allah". Things like terror, intimidation, and violence are therefore not recognized as legitimate behaviors establishing "the will of Allah", but as behaviors which undermine freedoms, justice, and the quality of our lives.For Westerners, our physical right to self-defense ends where our beliefs begin, both in cultural and legal terms. Our view, therefore, is that none of us (and I do mean none of us) can be a full member of free society while still carrying the expectation our most sacred beliefs not be subject to mockery and ridicule.I understand these principles may seem unfamiliar to you, and if that's the case, I understand how it must be difficult for you to distinguish between 'people' and 'ideas', or to appreciate the virtue of non-violence, but living in the West requires a person learn and unconditionally assimilate such principles (a refusal to do so could reasonably be interpreted as a one-way ticket to the nearest non-Western country being added to one's holiday wish list).</comment>

<comment>Nice try, but I assure you that Naidm (who is on his fourth handle by my count, though I may have missed some earlier ones) is not actually pro-peace. He is on the other side. He is rooting for Hamas and Hizbullah, and facts never limit what he says on their behalf or against Israelis.</comment>

<comment>If you must distort the truth to smooth your ego of lies - then you ought to think closely about what agenda you are supporting.</comment>

<comment>Laughable propaganda is all you have, huh?     Rational criticism of any religion and any religious doctrine, including Islam, is not anything less than a moral duty.</comment>

<comment>Khaled Abu Toameh is another excellent writer for Gatestone --- but since he excoriates Fatah etc. naturally the apologists despise him and are quick to lie about Gatestone.</comment>

<comment>You've never seen what doesn't exist, which is articles published there which are NOT factual, including the links in ideology between Fatah and the Islamic State.</comment>

<comment>There is this, "Palestinian Authority security officials in Ramallah expressed fear that the Al-Qaeda-affiliated group would try to establish terrorist cells also in the West Bank."Which mentions them both in the same sentence, but not as you suggested.  The rest can be found in the article by the brilliant Israeli Arab journalist, Khaled Abu Toameh, titled, "Al-Qaeda-linked New Terrorists, DAESH, in Gaza Strip."</comment>

<comment>Bradan just used The Nation and Alternet as sources in an attempt to discredit the Gatestone Institute as a “hate group.”Hilarious!</comment>

<comment>Niceness</comment>

<comment>The first article cited is by Max Blumenthal, a well known anti-Semitic and anti-Israel author, and the second is from a website of which he is a senior editor - if Gatestone or anyone praises anything about Israel or Jews, he is against it.It is Blumenthal who is a hater.Which Gatestone article do you have a problem with?</comment>

<comment>Another one of this sites resident anti-Muslim trolls is here to defend the hate group. You're proving my point.</comment>

<comment>Because you are unwilling or unable to hear criticism of Islamists and Islamic terrorists, and yet are often only too willing to use anti-Israel and anti-Semitic tropes, should you be described as this sites anti-Israel and anti-Semitic troll?</comment>

<comment>Your hateful kin have tried numerous times. The problem is none of you can find evidence for either of those slurs.</comment>

<comment>When someone disagrees with you your hateful responses are very evident.</comment>

<comment>Wait --- you defend MAX BLUMENTHAL??? And have the gall to attack anyone else (falsely) for taking seriously the scholarly articles at Gatestone Institute.org, which you false claim is a "hate group"???    Unbelievable.</comment>

<comment>I've asked him/her to point to one lie or incorrect fact from any of the journalists at Gatestone.  He/she hasn't - yet that likely won't stop him/her from continuing to spread falsehoods.</comment>

<comment>Those are not scholarly articles. That place is not peer reviewed nor does it have any reputation in the field.I refuse to allow that hateful group to be called scholars. They are not. They are hate mongers and part of the well studied Islamophobia industry.</comment>

<comment>Scholars of a problem. a set of current issues, with expertise and insights built up over many years, who eschew such propagandistic gibberish as "Islamophobia,"  a term of abuse sophistically deployed to shut down discussion of extremely problematic dogmas and practices with the religion. That's what they're doing, while you are merely some anonymous, insignificant apologist for the worst excesses of Islamism posting gibberish.     Another epic fail for your ilk.</comment>

<comment>So Burak Bekdil (the Turkish journalist) writes for a "hate group"?   Or is it more likely that some of the usual suspects are connected directly both to the people Bekdil and others at Gatestone expose as Islamofascists and people on the left who SHOULD know better, but don't?</comment>

<comment>Bekdil ROCKS!</comment>

<comment>What is funny is that in glancing at the long winded articles, I didn't see anything that accused the Gatestone of being nonfactual.  Did you?I did notice that the sites you gave links to criticize people for being too close to Israel (perish the thought), but nothing that accuses Gatestone of being inaccurate.  Newsflash- a site can be critical of Islam and be full of heart and facts.  Please do some inner thinking.  I'm guessing you deserve better than to be a peddler of garbage and hate (but I might be wrong - a risk worth taking).</comment>

<comment>Stop responding to me. I have no interest in hearing you shill for a hate group. If you wish to hide in an echo chamber do so. I refuse to join you.</comment>

<comment>I'm trying to get you out of the echo chamber.  It is a lonely and sad place in there full of angry hateful echos.  Fresh air is outside.Fair enough - you don't want to chat - if you don't respond or talk about me, then I won't respond to you.  Be well.</comment>

<comment>Your delusional and disconnection from reality is truly scary. </comment>

<comment>What did I say that isn't real?</comment>

<comment>Why would they resort to terrorism when they get our armed forces to decimate entire countries for them? That would be ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Name one country that Israel got our armed forces to decimate.  One.  (hence - you are proving my point lying about Israel).Waiting.</comment>

<comment>http://mondoweiss.net/2015/03/...Now you are gonna have to discredit Barney Frank. But it won't work on me. My work is done here. </comment>

<comment>Do you forget American history and the lies of George Bush to get the US into the war against Iraq?  Valerie Plame ring a bell? I see you frequent hate sites as Mondoweiss is - but it is full of non-facts.  Even if Netanyahu influenced congress at all to allow the US to attack Iraq - it was not he who got our entire forces to decimate an entire country (or as your initial post suggests, "countries."  Glad your "work" is done - if you do any more "work" our civilization would go into reverse.</comment>

<comment>Think you got a little spit on your bib there.</comment>

<comment>Ew - only if you got too close.  Thank G-d you did not.But - that was probably the most mature thing you have ever said - so slightly less in reverse than before.  Keep trying - your engine might go forward one day - the view is lovely then,</comment>

<comment>ESL.. I get it.</comment>

<comment>Yea, about 70% of Muslims are rational.  The 30% minority (only about a half billion) support terrorism.  Look it up.</comment>

<comment>The Israeli Right uses Islamic extremism occurring in other countries to divert attention away from the real cause of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is the occupation and colonization of Palestinian territory. Saying that they are all just sub-human, fanatical Muslims who have no goal besides killing Jews is much easier and much more politically beneficial than actually addressing the real cause of the conflict.</comment>

<comment>Islamic extremism affected Jews long before the establishment of modern day Israel and it is what prevents Palestinians from having the newly created state that they long for.The Hebron Masacre in 1929, making Hebron Jew free for the first time (though many Arabs hid some Jews) is just an example - and the last Arab on Jewish attack in the region before Jews started to preemptively fight back.I find it interesting how people look down on Westernized colonization but have no bad issue with Islamic colonization though evidence demonstrates that the relatively new religion has conquered, oppressed and abused people in land masses that shrink the tiny state of Israel.I recommend writings by Palestinian scholar Bassam Tawil or Israeli Arab Khaled abu Toameh.  They write with integrity, intelligence and bravery.</comment>

<comment>This Muslim terrorist couple slaughtered the very same people who had thrown them a baby shower only months earlier. Americans are generous and even open minded to a fault.</comment>

<comment>Yea I know, they were feeding Eric Rudolph on their back porch....</comment>

<comment>There are an estimated 6 million Muslims. Many are not citizens. Those that aren't should be repatriated; Muslim immigration should stop.</comment>

<comment>I don't care if its ten thousand. If you keep demonizing them, they might kill you, me or our kids dummy. Just let the HLS, FBI etc do their job and keep your eyes open and hateful mouth shut.</comment>

<comment>They kill us whether we demonize them or not. Stop Muslim immigration, repatriate the non-citizens.</comment>

<comment>Ok den...</comment>

<comment>Muslim groups keep estimating that there are 6 million Muslims in the US. Non-muslim groups usually estimate 2 to 3 million.</comment>

<comment>There's actually fewer than 3 million American Muslims and many if not most have college degrees and high paying jobs, but otherwise I agree.</comment>

<comment>What people have a hard time wrapping their heads around is the  degree of radical response that Muslim populations in the West have. When marginalized groups here (blacks, gays, Latinos) have a reaction to perceived oppression, some in the fringe have violent reactions, but most reactions are measured and confined to the rules of civil society. The fact that extremely violent reactions occur with some level of implicit societal approval within Muslim society creates massive distrust. There does need to be a measured level of scrutiny into the root cause (maybe within the religion itself). </comment>

<comment>You mean like when the lady cracks her in her face with a beer mug, causing her teeth to come through her cheek and crushing cheek bone, busting her eye socket... for speaking Arabic?  Or punching the pregnant arab lady in her  stomach b/c she's dressed like "one" ?</comment>

<comment>Why the hell does it matter? Jesus, all this crap about "is it terrorism?". What difference at this point does it make?</comment>

<comment>Wow, you really are a buzzkill. The pitchfork people are gonna love you!</comment>

<comment>Pitch forks. Pitch forks everywhere.</comment>

<comment>They had a remote-controlled device with three pipe bombs set to go off when the first responders arrived - that is not workplace violence.</comment>

<comment>The biggest problem is the general public thinks of "terrorism" as something other people do, but our domestic radicals as something else. Academics don't, and law enforcement is essentially stuck between the two.There are political reasons for this as well, some domestic groups linked to terrorist actions in the United States have political protectors or partisans that object to any definition to classify them as such. That's why anti-abortion violence, despite clearly fitting the FBI term, is rarely classified as terrorism.The problem is being defined as terrorism by the government brings much better resources to the investigation, so the fact that so few domestic radicals are called terrorists actually does have a real world effect. It's not just semantics.</comment>

<comment>Whine more, you mentally ill shill.</comment>

<comment>You're the one whining.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be taking criticism of anti abortion violence very personally. Why is that?</comment>

<comment>Bill Ayers, bomb maker, terrorist, serial bomber, and current contributor to developing educational curriculum for children worked with Obama on various boards over a period of several years. Only last year Obama attended a wedding with Ayers.One of Bill Clinton's last acts in office, in his literal final hours. was a pardon of 140 criminal offenders, including two more Weather underground bombers (and also some of his personal friends).Now The Weathermen terrorists of the 60s-70s are professors at universities, lobbyists and judges, and friends of the white-house.http://www.snopes.com/politics...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Your links disprove your thesis."Only last year Obama attended a wedding with Ayers."Did you make that one up yourself? What a clever little troll you are.</comment>

<comment>I was curious, so I looked. It seems to be superficially true.http://thehill.com/homenews/ad...On the other hand, with friends like that, who needs enemies:"Although critics of Obama have insinuated close ties between the president and Ayers, the former Weather Underground member said in an interview just two months before the wedding that he believed Obama should be put on trial for war crimes at The Hague."Note to self: Don't make friends with domestic terrorists.</comment>

<comment>All federal agencies are completely politicized.This is not a statement from the FBI saying it's not terrorism.  The statement is from Obama through some guy he appointed.   The actual FBI is the agents themselves who have nothing to do with these kinds of decisions.</comment>

<comment>There is a statement from the FBI. Your conspiracy theory is invalid.</comment>

<comment>Not at all, shill</comment>

<comment>Clearly terrorism. Clearly Islamic terrorism.</comment>

<comment>What was the motivation? </comment>

<comment>To coerce. To intimidate. To slaughter.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The attacks themselves.</comment>

<comment>Maybe try reading the article for the fbi's definition of terrorism. Because that ain't it. </comment>

<comment>it sure is</comment>

<comment>Like I said,  read the article. It usually helps. </comment>

<comment>Not at RaceLantic</comment>

<comment>Yea,  god forbid you actually learn something. </comment>

<comment>Syed Rizwan Farook had inside information about the people he killed.  He knew they would be consolidated into one room, as easy targets, celebrating during a party that he was invited to and attended.  These same employees that he killed, also threw a baby shower for him and his wife.  Jihad at all costs.There is no such thing as Islamophobia as there is no such thing as an irrational fear of Islam - a religion/ideology created by a man who sliced heads off peaceful people while distributing the children of the victims as booty to his gang of theives. Today's jihadists emulate him - even after they befriend their future victims.  It is sad.  There are so many good Muslim people and hopefully they will be able to lead the way to reforming a religion that needs much reformation to be compatible with those who value life, liberty, freedom and happiness.</comment>

<comment>Even if he did it because of ISIS, it is still 50% workplace violence. You have to really hate your co-workers to shoot 30 of them. Of all people to shoot in an attack, why your co-workers?</comment>

<comment>It's a large congregation of people in an undefended location. Why not target co-workers if your goal was mass casualties?</comment>

<comment>Stay with what you know. It's good advice in lots of things, including mass murder. It's a lot easier to kill people when you know what to expect.</comment>

<comment>No, you don't have to really hate your co-workers to shoot them. You just have to conceive that it is your personal duty to obey the Koran's injunction to smite the unbelievers.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The FBI is controlled by the Executive branch of our govt, which is controlled by a guy who can't bring himself to utter the word terrorism....so it's really not that big of a leap.</comment>

<comment>They arent calling it terrorism because thats deconstructs the narrative they have been building for the past 8 years. Fortunately for the administration, the press is ready to play along with this taking every facial the administration gives them with open mouths and closed eyes.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That's what they do behind the scenes to actually protect people. The public face they put on counter terrorism efforts are a PR show that must fall in line with the administrations grander political objectives.</comment>

<comment>Except it didn't "protect" anyone. Thats why the court ordered them to stop.</comment>

<comment>They haven't been spying well enough if these two got through.</comment>

<comment>http://dailycaller.com/2015/12...Yea, dude spent his free time at the mosque, but it's not terrorism.Come on RaceLantic</comment>

<comment>The political Left was happy to call this terrorism when they thought it was a white guy doing it, but when they find out it was a middle eastern man + woman they suddenly can't bring themselves to call it that.</comment>

<comment>And others can see it both ways, two or more people radicalized who take out their paranoia at work.</comment>

<comment>You're suggesting that they may have been Islamic extremists who just so happened to go on a rampage independent of their extremism and therefore it's maybe not terrorism??  You're really grasping at straws here.</comment>

<comment>Yep. More than likely they were planning political terror and settled for a local outburst out of some perceived slight.</comment>

<comment>You're capable of some truly impressive mental and semantic gymnastics if you can look at the facts of this case and conclude it is not terrorism.</comment>

<comment>It terrified a lot of people but probably not the way they intended.</comment>

<comment>Hillary, Is that you?</comment>

<comment>I think we can all agree that it accelerates xenophobia among those with natural proclivities toward generalized fear.</comment>

<comment>Whenever someone starts out "I think we can all agree..." you are about to hear puppies-are-cute level banality, or a very contentious view being presented without critical thought. </comment>

<comment>The irony is your own comments and behavior validate that "banality" up there.</comment>

<comment>Okay, I'll rephrase.  People who use xenophobia as a default rationale are generally @ss holes.</comment>

<comment>Unlike the shootings in Colorado Springs.</comment>

<comment>Terrorism is about intimidation. This wasn't about intimidation, it was about killing for the sake of killing the enemy. It's not terrorism. It is an act of war and this is the battlefield. I make the same distinction between rebels fighting the civil war and domestic terrorists whose aim is to intimidate. I am a liberal, by the way. I hate all warmongers. </comment>

<comment>Then you must hate Mohammed.</comment>

<comment>I am more concerned about people who are alive right now than factionalized (edit: I meant fictionalized, but factionalized also works) historical figures.</comment>

<comment>Gun control will not protect you from terrorism.</comment>

<comment>After all, terrorism is caused by global warming as we all now know!</comment>

<comment>And global inequality, right?</comment>

<comment>Actually, fascism and gun control were protecting many people in the Middle East from terrorism.</comment>

<comment>Throwing around the word terrorism cheapens the definition.Because the real terrorism is happening on campuses like Yale and Claremont McKenna.  Those places are like the Gaza Strip. </comment>

<comment>Yale is a virtual war zone. You should see what happened to their safe space.Edit: It's called the Pink Zone and the three ring Alaska Barrier defense has been breached. All the Fobbits were running for the bunkers.</comment>

<comment>Terrorism is a word used to beat whatever the opposition is over the head with. This was mass murder, and we should get to the bottom of motive and whether there were any signals that were missed that if detected could have allowed an intervention.Further labeling it terrorism does not add any value. Knowing more about the act does.</comment>

<comment>From your perspective, were the recent attacks in Paris terrorism?</comment>

<comment>They were a mass murder of innocent people probably intended to terrorize the French people and the West.  To what purpose I do not know.I just find the "terrorism or not" debate to be rather useless. We want to know who did it, why they did it, how they did it, who to bring justice to, and whether we can learn anything to prevent something similar from happening again. Beyond that who gives a s**t.</comment>

<comment>"learn anything to prevent something similar from happening again"To do this, in my opinion, it requires an understanding of the motive in addition to the Who, What, Where, with What, etc. An act of mass murder should result in 'defensive actions' - restricting the supply of weapons available to complete the attacks, improving health services for mentally ill individuals, (wherever your bias leads you). An act of terrorism requires offensive actions in addition to defensive actions - destruction of a training center, cutting funding for groups, combating an ideology through education.</comment>

<comment>That is why I included "why". Why = motive. I agree that intercepting violent acts of a group requires an offensive as well as defensive strategy. But in the San Bernadino case, there does not appear to have been much of a group behind this. In Paris, there was.</comment>

<comment>Organization isn't what matters. Ideology does.The Ku Klux Klan is a shell of its former self. The organization hasn't committed a violent terrorist act in years. But extremist right-wing attacks continue to be perpetrated by individuals who hold an ideology similar to that of the Klan. I believe it's still pertinent to fight the poisonous ideology to prevent all attacks.</comment>

<comment>The KKK lost steam because the country changed and they lost their base. ISIS and related knucklehead jihadis will lose steam once the Muslim world manages to move past them. In the meantime we have to do what we can to speed that along and limit the carnage. We have to be careful in fighting the ideology that fuels jihadis that we don't increase rather than decrease their base.</comment>

<comment>you're a real piece of work</comment>

<comment>Thanks. You should see what my abs used to look like.</comment>

<comment>i bet you could have scrubbed all the bullshit you toss around off your clothes with them.</comment>

<comment>I'm flabbergasted that the Charleston mass shooting is not considered "terrorism".  Roof had clear political goals (i.e. a race war) however, unrealistic. Same with anti-abortion violence: it's clearly meant to manipulate public policy. </comment>

<comment>Not necessarily. It can be just to punish people for what some people consider bad acts.</comment>

<comment>Well from what I've read ISIL wants us infidels to turn on the muslims living in our infidel countries so they are forced to flee to their ISIL shithole in the middle east where they can live under the rule of their caliphate.  If these murderers in this case turn out to have been an ISIL sleeper cell who were ordered to kill people who they knew and worked with for five years?  And these murderers weren't your robe wearing monkey bar swinging AK-47 toting stereotypical jihadists, they were educated people who did the 9-5 thing like the rest of us.  Even the male murderer's BIL was shocked.  Taking all that into account I can see this as a terroristic act helping them towards that alleged goal.</comment>

<comment>We can't really make a claim about this until it is clearer what the motive was. If one supposes that it is islamic terrorism pure and simple, why attack that target, and not something somewhat more symbolic of the united states. If it's the apotheosis of workplace violence, then why the massive stockpile? a lot of the parts of this are unclear to me.</comment>

<comment>You are over thinking it. Black-white. Good-bad. Terrorism-not terrorism. Some people need it kept real simple.</comment>

<comment>Well, who says their outrage as Islamists is directed against the "United States" per se, rather than Western culture, in which case the target makes sense.  Was shooting up a Jewish grocery really the best way for the Paris attackers to get at Israel?</comment>

<comment>No, but a jewish grocery store has at least some connection to israel. That makes a certain amount of sense if you think there is a massive conspiracy on the part of israel. The target here doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me. Actually, none of this makes sense to me. You have a husband and wife team with an arsenal of weapons and a new child, who are apparently living the american dream, and decide to shoot up and bomb their workplace.I guess if you think America is a massive greedy octopus, the argument could be made that attacking your workplace would be an attack on capitalism.</comment>

<comment>A kosher, Jewish grocery store does not have a connection to Israel. A kosher grocery has a connection to Judaism. Coulibaly was murdering Jews, not making a statement about Israel.</comment>

<comment>I didn't mean a literal connection, I meant that there was an understandable logic chain somewhere in the choice of target, however erroneous. Israel is considered to be a Jewish state by some, this grocery store is owned by jews, therefore Israel owns this grocery store type of thing</comment>

<comment>What part of Islamist hating Western culture is difficult to understand?  I mean of you can draw a line from random Jews to Israel, I'd think you could see how unveiled women, LGBT people, open pagans and atheists, and so on that one finds in modern pluralistic offices might be a target of their ideological fury. </comment>

<comment>I guess the part where there is solid evidence in this case that that is what the shooting was about</comment>

<comment>If your target is American citizens, one place is just as good as any. Since he worked there, he had a key card and could get in. If they wanted to hit more than one place, a place where people recognize you and you could get in and out before anyone called the police would leave you time to get to another place.Also, one of the ideas is that you could be a victim anywhere. Many people made that point about Paris. The very ordinariness of the location drives greater fear. The fact that the killer could be someone you know and have been nice to also drives greater fear.I'm not saying that is the case, but you asked why target this place and it seems to me pretty easy to answer.</comment>

<comment>That's ridiculous. The proper reaction to any form of violence is to immediately jump to conclusions.</comment>

<comment>This is what you would call a soft target. So you don't need go after any highvalue one to instill fear in the public.</comment>

<comment>The most obvious answer would seem they were 'self radicalized' and picked the target because he was familiar with it and felt there was a good chance for success, and they did manage to kill a lot of people, get away, get back to their house, where they had more bombs, before getting caught.I suppose he could have had some grudge, but so far, there doesn't seem to be any evidence for it, and the very people he killed had  just given him/his wife a baby shower.If the two had been better bomb makers the level of mayhem would  have been much higher.  I don't know if the bomb they left was big enough to blow up the whole building, probably not, but it would have made it a substantially bigger inciddent.</comment>

<comment>Because they want to make you afraid to go about your daily life. If you pick random targets, it keeps the American people more on edge.</comment>

<comment>"it keeps the American people more on edge."Does it? And even assuming this is true, that doesn't necessarily mean that this was terrorism. The point stands that we need to know the motive for the attack before one can determine whether this was a terrorist attack or not.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't random though. He worked there.</comment>

<comment>Random to us, not necessarily random to him. Its effect is to make you look at Mohammad down the hall and start nervously sweating.It was the tactic of the Palestinians, especially during the Second Intifada, to attack cafes, buses, restaurants, etc. It was meant to instill total fear in the populace that nowhere was safe. You could be killed sipping your caffe, dancing with your friends, or going to your job. It changed the entire relationship and outlook Israelis had toward Israeli Arabs and Palestinians; it was quite effective.</comment>

<comment>Just pointing out that it wasn't random. If that was his intent, it failed because it looks partially like a workplace shooting now.</comment>

<comment>My guess is that they were terrorists that lost their temper and created a "workplace violence incident" instead of the terror attack they originally planned</comment>

<comment>That's what it is starting to look like. But it remains odd to me that someone would be planning an obviously bigger attack and then compromise everything over a workplace issue.</comment>

<comment>Why the FBI isn't Calling San Bernardino "Terrorism"...because they're intellectually dishonest, maybe?</comment>

<comment>The Justice Department is pathologically incapable of labeling such acts "terrorism" because it doesn't have the fortitude to confront that there is a serious sickness within Islam.</comment>

<comment>It is amazing that the political Left, which endlessly mocks Christianity and in general is no fan of religion bends over backwards making excuses for Islamic extremism.  Particularly when Islamic extremists are some of them most brutal people in the world towards homosexuals, women, etc.</comment>

<comment>I had not noticed the "political left" making excuses for Islamic extremists. Can you provide an example?</comment>

<comment>One example that comes to mind is how Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, got all bent out of shape at some Indiana law that created some religious conscience exemptions to their discrimination statutes. He made a big deal about it, okay fine, but meanwhile Apple continued to sell Apple products in Saudi Arabia where gay people are killed for merely being gay.</comment>

<comment>So....Tim Cook is on the political left? And he made excuses for Islamic extremists when?</comment>

<comment>Here's an example:http://www.newsbusters.org/blo...Or here is another example if you only listen to people on the Left:http://www.washingtontimes.com...See also the administration's unwillingness to call anything "islamic extremism/terror"</comment>

<comment>Obama is waging a small war in Iraq, Syria, and elsewhere against ISIS, al queda, and other Islamic extremists who kill people and break things. He isn't exactly sending them doves and flowers. Some people want that war to be bigger. But Bush tried that and it did not work out well.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure if they want the war to be "bigger" per say as much as it would be nice to have a leader that isn't purposefully obtuse in discussing the events that took place</comment>

<comment>I don't think that is it at all. I think there are some who want to widen the war against more Muslims, or Muslim majority countries. And they are goading Obama to do this.</comment>

<comment>why would we wage a crusade against a religion? that's retarded.</comment>

<comment>There is no war against Muslims.  Though it beats me why we toppled the Libyan government or why we appear obsessed with ousting Assad, even at the risk of arming a totally insane terrorist group like ISIS.</comment>

<comment>When protesters first rose against Assad in 2011, they were not led by al Qaeda and ISIS had not yet formed.</comment>

<comment>An unbelievably small war in Iraq and Syria. As small and as late a little war as Obama can possibly make it.Obama is being forced to act, very much against his own will. So he is doing the absolute minimum.</comment>

<comment>Well I think it's normal to worry more about what happens in one's own country.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, but there's a big difference between executing someone because of whom they are sexually attracted to and allowing someone to opt out of catering to a SSM for religious reasons.</comment>

<comment>You can't flip out about every issue in every county though. Uganda. Russia. Saudi Arabia. North Korea. The human rights abuses just go on and on. It would be a constant state of moral apoplexy if you freaked out about everyone, so you focus on your own standards in your own country.</comment>

<comment>Maybe, but the hypocrisy was glaring for me.Another example I encountered was at my wife's Alma Mater, Smith College. There were a lot of so-called feminists there who made excuse after excuse for the treatment of women in Muslim countries. "It's their culture," they would say.</comment>

<comment>For an example of that, you might want to look at this story about a recent incident involving Maryam Namazie. Goldsmiths Feminist Society Stands in Solidarity with Goldsmiths Islamic Societ I haven't read that particular article yet, I'm great admirer of Namazie who I think is a wonderful and brave woman and have read several different takes on the incident. I was looking for a summary that includes the fact that the feminist society supported the Islamic society against the right of a female human rights campaigner who was raised as a Muslim to speak.Some people have started to use the term "regressive left." The website One Law for All has a pdf called "Siding with the Oppressor: The Pro-Islamist Left."We're either heading into a major ideological battle on the left, or the left is going to lose liberals, mean people who believe in the dignity of individuals and who believe rights should not be apportioned differently according to the racial, ethnic or religious group the broader society puts you in.</comment>

<comment>I simply don't think it's hypocritical to focus on your own country.I do agree that the "it's their culture" talk is disgusting. As a woman I couldn't hate that whole set of excuses more. However, that's not what we're talking about here.</comment>

<comment>You might want to look at my comment below. I think we can learn from the fights that are occurring in other countries.</comment>

<comment>Double standards are always hypocritical.</comment>

<comment>There were a lot of so-called feminists there who made excuse after excuse for the treatment of women in Muslim countries. "It's their culture," they would say.It's because of multi-culturalism and moral relativism. If good and evil don't exist except inside a cultural context, then you're only allowed to condemn your own culture. The double standard is built-in.Of course this is nonsense which makes a fetish of porous and dynamic cultural boundaries. But this self-contradictory philosophy is crippling Western thought.</comment>

<comment>Probably the most spectacularly craven display was all of the Democrat candidates at their last presidential debate refusing to use the term "radical Islam" repeatedly.</comment>

<comment>Here we go again. First off, words don't matter as much as deeds. Secondly, you can be as radical as you want in your beliefs, whether you are a Christian, Muslim, or a follower of that spaghetti god. Our Constitution doesn't care. I know some Christians who are convinced that it's God's will that they never use birth control, only homeschool their children, and require that their women wear long skirts and that their daughters don't kiss a man until their wedding day. There's Orthodox Jews that still follow 400 plus tenets of Jewish law. And they're perfectly welcome to that. They don't try to impose these things in the rest of us, with violence or otherwise.It's when you are convinced that your beliefs justify and require violence on your part, and you act on them, that there's a problem. Yes, there's a clear fact that some versions of Islam justify terrorism. But the problem is that justification, not the beliefs of everybody else, about which this republic has decided it officially doesn't care. </comment>

<comment>Our Constitution doesn't care about your religion as long as your creed does not involve overthrowing the Constitution. But if it does, then the Constitution cares very much.We saw all this in the long struggle against Communism. The struggle is not that different against Islamism, except that the Islamists have a better chance of using our own tolerance against us.</comment>

<comment> Clinton and Obama  are doing that today.  This is Islamic terrorism and not a mass shooting  or work place violence, which is the narrative they are trying to push</comment>

<comment>No, they aren't. Obama is dropping bombs on radical Islamists in Iraq and Syria.</comment>

<comment>You need to clean out your ears.   This morning Hillary was shrieking about gun control and Obama has yet to describe it for why it is, Islamic terrorism."Obama is dropping bombs on radical Islamists in Iraq and Syria."Get a clue, the terrorists are already in this countryBTW, combat pilots are complaining that they cannot strike 75% of the targets they want to hit.The air compaign is symboloc.http://freebeacon.com/national...</comment>

<comment>The Political Left refuses to assign blame to Islamism even in cases like this where it is obvious.The contrast between their extreme reluctance to even say the words 'radical Islam" much less call this attack an act of jihad, and the extreme rapidity which they will blame purely hypothetical "violent right-wing rhetoric" for an attack on Planned Parenthood by someone who is clearly crazy could not be more obvious.</comment>

<comment>The biggest area of cognitive dissonance is concerning gays. If a Christian says, "I don't agree with gay marriage," than that person is the biggest bigot that ever lived. If a Muslim pushes a gay man off a building there's this ennui that comes from the left.</comment>

<comment>The secular left and devout Muslims... strangest bedfellows since Flavor Flav and Brigette Nielssen.</comment>
