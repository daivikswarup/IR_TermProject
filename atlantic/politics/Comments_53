<comment>The senate can pass a sentencing reform bill and the president can sign it - but that only affects federal prisoners which are a small minority of all people behind bars. The states are the ones with outrageous sentences on the books and oceans of people behind bars. There's still people doing time in one state for what's legal a state over and guys doing time because ten years ago a judge wanted to prove a point. This is latticework of laws put on the books because of paranoid voters 25 years ago.Reformers need a fifty-state strategy and might as well ignore the federal level. The Federal government if it really wanted to could maybe offer money to pay for prisons in exchange for states adopting new sentencing guidelines. A carrot to go with some stick. That's assuming congress and the president agree on anything. Practically every state in the union is going broke because of its bloated, overcrowded, underfunded prisons. Even then, only the Democratic states would go for it and the Republican states - currently 31 out of 50 - would reject sentencing reform just out of spite, much less genuine fear on the part of any politician that he'll empty the prisons and let out a spree killer. Anyone expecting instant gratification and swift justice when it comes to reforming prisons better get used to being bitter and disappointed. There's barely enough resources and mercy for kids and grandmas. There's little left over for prisoners.</comment>

<comment>The period of going easy on criminals and increase in crime rate is upon us, just like 60's onwards until the blowoff top in early 90's. The machiavellian inside may not mind it as much, security is the linchpin issue for conservative majorities in west.</comment>
