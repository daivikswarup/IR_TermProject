<comment>Politics is hard work. Sometimes I wonder if shiny new candidates like Trump or Sanders succeed in large part because of their ability to deliver instant gratification.Many moons ago I volunteered to serve as a precinct captain for a U.S. Senate candidate. It was a slog: poring over voter rolls, walking my precinct, knocking on doors, getting most of those doors slammed in my face, being scorned or lied to or flummoxed by inane questions or responses when someone actually answered the door, then as Election Day approached trying to herd all those cats, find childcare so somebody could go to the polls or a ride for somebody on crutches, follow up on absentee ballots, distribute buttons and bumper stickers and lawn signs, try to keep our opponent's volunteers from trashing our signs, hovering at the polling station for ~16 hours comparing who voted with who said they would vote and rushing back to my apartment to call those who hadn't showed up (this was in the days before cell phones). What did I get out of it, besides a little satisfaction and a modicum of knowledge? A T-shirt, which I sold a few weeks later for five bucks at a garage sale.Magnify my experience times 1000 and add a zillion bucks and months or years of meetings, rallies, phone calls, focus groups, handshakes, polling, deals, treachery, innuendo, promises, press releases, bad coffee, speeches, lawyers, interviews, etc. and you approximate what an "establishment" candidate and his or her staff endure. To become county supervisor.As passionate as they might appear, I'm not sure many of this cycle's newbies--the voters, not the candidates--are prepared to do the heavy lifting, to look beyond November 2016, to lose and accept the defeat and keep coming back for more.I hope they keep coming back; democracy works better when they do. I hope I'm wrong.</comment>

<comment>I think it's helpful to have glimpses like this one into the process. And I agree with your comment regarding "heavy lifting". I'm not sure Bernie will be up to that, long term (and I say this as someone who admires him) and I don't think Trump is that interested in it, frankly.</comment>

<comment>I have never seen any person simply change their mind on the spot due to the persuasions of another person.  People everywhere like to make up their own mind.  When I see some snowflake on the sidewalk with a clipboard I ignore them, and I urge everyone to do the same.  These snowflakes have no idea what real life is like.  Why should I listen to them?  There is plenty on TV now to decide which candidate is the best for you.  Most of the coverage is bias towards the left so I recommend watching Fox to get a complete picture of any candidate.</comment>

<comment>"Most of the coverage is bias towards the left so I recommend watching Fox to get a complete picture of any candidate."that's funny.if you want an unbiased view, don't watch any of the cable news networks.</comment>

<comment>I disagree. If you are going to arrive at an informed opinion about any candidate, then you must hear the other side.  All the networks are liberal, except Fox.  Some, like NBC, are hopelessly skewed and do not provide accurate journalism.  You should watch them all (the networks) in order to make an honest and informed decision.</comment>

<comment>and fox is conservative.all cable news channels are biased one way or another and are horrible at delivering "24 hour news".  i choose to not watch any of them and get my news from other sources.  cable news, in my opinioin, just rots your brain with opinionated punditry.</comment>

<comment>My original point was that anyone very young and with a clipboard canvasing your precinct is someone you should not be listening to, ever.  These are people with an agenda, and they are guaranteed not to have your interests in mind. They have their own interests in mind.   You should read, like you are doing, but hear both sides.  Heck, try to get an independent opinion if you can.  This is pretty much impossible.</comment>

<comment>But neither Fox nor the alphabet networks represent the viewpoint of those getting screwed left and right by "free trade" or by cheap labor that benefits the big guys, or by bail-outs for Wall Street but not for the rest of us--average guy credit card users, college kids, seniors watching their savings evaporate. Politics and the forgiveness of huge indebtedness only applies to Washington and Wall Street, not to fly-over country or small banks or small businesses. Both Trump and Sanders address a left-out constituency. This constituency is not only blue collar--it's anybody politically disconnected. America is sick of the inauthenticity of contemporary culture and politics. It reeks of favoritism, bias, and corruption.</comment>

<comment>you don't need to tell me this; i already know.</comment>

<comment>Um hmm.  See, that's why Trump wins in a landslide.  A historical landslide.</comment>

<comment>If 80% of life is just showing up, those canvassers on the street are testament to their candidates and their causes, just by being there. Ideas that get people out on the street are ideas whose time has arrived.</comment>

<comment>It's 90 % of success in life, for one thing.  Anthropogenic climate change is the "Salem Witch Trials" of our generation, a solution in search of a problem.  Bernie is a deluded would-be demagogue.  I'll bet Hillary will be indicted before the end of March.  Cruz will lose.  Robio don't compute.  Kasich is a wimpy cry-baby who'd strangle his own mother for 3 more percentage points in the polls.  Carson has to be some kind of sick joke, and don't even get me started on that vacuous toady Jeb!</comment>

<comment>Please vote in the primaries!</comment>

<comment>You are wrong. This IS us "coming back". Do you think it's a coincidence that, just a few short years after thousands of people marched on Wall Street and occupied public spaces in cities all across the country, there is now a leading Presidential candidate who is... taking on Wall Street?I have not met a single Sanders supporter (I've met many) who thinks much of his agenda is going to pass. What's important is that he is reshaping the country's political discourse on our terms, and exposing the wholesale corruption of the Democratic Party.</comment>

<comment>If you let your rabid partisanship down, you would have noticed that both Occupy and the Tea Party were massively against Wall Street.  it was the bail outs that launched the Tea Party</comment>

<comment>Try the damn delayed gratification until all hell freezes over.</comment>

<comment>"Instant gratification???!?!?!?"  You mean like providing million of cheap housekeeping to the rich by letting millions of illegals in??  Or expanding trade to hellholes like Vietnam where wages can further be pushed down.  BTW in regards to Vietnam - 40 years ago they chose not to have capitalism and killed 50k US service men to keep their failed style of govt.  I say let them stew in it for another generation.  Why should we help these jackasses 'rediscover' capitalism like China.  I say, you made a choice now you cannot change your mind.  Enjoy poverty</comment>

<comment>The difference between Sanders on the one hand, and Trump and Clinton on the other, is that Sanders is pro-Labor.http://inthesetimes.com/workin...</comment>

<comment>Most organized labor in the US are professional workers who have the talent to navigate a multicultural coalition that most blue collar workers lack.</comment>

<comment>At the very least, this calls Hillary's character, her integrity, into serious question.Yale Law School students Hillary Rodham and Bill Clinton were both members, alongside future Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal and Bill Clinton’s eventual Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor Robert Reich, of the Yale Law School Students Committee for Local 35, the university's blue-collar worker union, and signatories, during the week before the union went on strike, to a statement asserting “WE BELIEVE THE UNION DESERVES THE SUPPORT OF YALE STUDENTS AND FACULTY." Bill Clinton was even, former UNITE HERE President John Wilhelm would note decades later in his eulogy for Vincent Sirabella, the Voter Registration Chairman of the Sirabella for Mayor Campaign.And yet, on her first date with classmate Clinton in 1971, Rodham would later recall:The relationship between Rodham and Clinton, two instrumental figures in the decoupling of the Democratic Party from the priorities of the mainstream labor movement, thus began with the crossing of a picket line.When Rodham and Clinton picked up the garbage strewn about the art gallery courtyard (if, indeed, they ever did so), they were doing exactly what everyone from Vincent Sirabella to the Black Student Alliance at Yale had asked students not to do: they were performing—or at the very least offering to perform—the work that members of Local 35’s Grounds Maintenance division, had refused.Rodham and Clinton were offering themselves as replacement labor, blunting, if only temporarily, the effects of the strike on the university. The two law students then bartered their litter pickup, which was, in essence, scab labor (or maybe just the promise thereof) into access to a struck building.The art gallery and other nonessential buildings were closed because the university did not have enough managers to keep them open during the strike. They were closed because the people who usually cleaned and repaired them, whose labor helped make the university’s display of art possible, had been forced to absent themselves by the necessity which fueled the ongoing strike.For Rodham and Clinton, the workers’ concerns were at best secondary to the romance of the empty museum, the sophistication and transgressive pleasure offered not only by the modernist art, but also by the act of violating the strike. Hillary Rodham Clinton offers this anecdote in her 2003 memoir Living History not in her discussion of how her time in New Haven affected her understanding of urban politics and life, but rather in a distinct chapter devoted entirely to the origins of her relationship with the “Viking from Arkansas.” The “labor dispute,” not even named here as a strike, is not only abstracted from the very spaces the future Clintons inhabit in this narrative, it is made incidental to them, an obstacle which has to be sidestepped in order for the art to be viewed and the date to acquire its romantic ambiance.</comment>

<comment>WRONG - most are government workers - like the DMV and the idiots at the county/city building who are totally incompetent.  As far as professionals - while the govt has decimated blue collar workers in the name of globalization - MOST white collar professionals are protected by licensing and credential bureaucracies.  So we have barriers to entry for lawyers/doctors etc, but none for manufacturing workers.  It is neither skills that protect white collar professionals</comment>

<comment>No. The difference is Sanders represents a failed ideology whereas Trump is a pragmatist with a history of practical accomplishments. As for Hillary--she's for Hillary. She'll do and say whatever will get her elected. Her so-called "experience" is one of consistent failure.</comment>

<comment>Trump has never expressed any anti-labor sentiment.  In fact he is against TPP and wants to basically shut down NAFTA.  that is pretty pro-labor there buddy</comment>

<comment>The reason why we are seeing Sanders and Trump rise is because the Establishment on both parties has failed the American people.The Washington Consensus has been disastrous for the bulk of the American people, while a small group of ultra  wealthy become wealthier at the expense of the rest of society.The Establishment's legitimacy was always based on one thing, this ability to deliver  a high standard of living for the American people. They failed. This was due to greed. They have effectively built a plutocracy that is pretending to be a democratic society.Generation Y, which has overwhelmingly flocked towards Sanders has suffered disproportionately in the economic crisis.  The anger that spawned the Occupy movement is still very strong. Many of my generation are unemployed or underemployed.The right-wing effort to get people to vote against their economic interests, while using social issues as a cover too has backfired and working class conservative whites are overwhelmingly going to Trump. The collapse of American manufacturing has hit them especially hard.The Establishment has failed both groups especially hard and as a result, they have lost their legitimacy. Basically, unless you are in the 1%, you are voting against your interest if you support the Establishment because it means more of the same disastrous policies. </comment>

<comment>Nailed it.Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Though I don't generally consider myself a cynical person, I can't help but feel that the people behind both parties are only concerned with maintaining power and using that power for personal gain. Issues like gun control and abortion are used as distractions. Neither side is going to do much at all to move the country to one side or the other on these issues without a constitutional amendment (which isn't going to happen), but the parties use our passions about these subjects to get us to contribute money and to keep us from asking about things that actually can be changed.I think that it's a good possibility that a Sanders or Trump presidency could be a disaster. On the other hand, I can't help but feel that doing what we always do - voting in an establishment candidate from one of the two parties - would be more of a disaster long term.</comment>

<comment>The key is to look like you're trying to do something without actually fixing anything.  The church needs the devil, right?</comment>

<comment>"Issues like gun control and abortion are used as distractions." Exactly. "God, guns, and gays", as a GOP strategist once put it. The real agenda that gets through Congress has been tax cuts, deregulation, and bailouts for the rich, Wall Street, and the banking system. Both parties have been complicit in this, although it's worse on the GOP side.</comment>

<comment>>> "God, guns, and gays", as a GOP strategist once put itThe Democratic version is "Race, minorities, and women"</comment>

<comment>I wish that were true, but if a more liberal USSC overturns Heller, a lot of "blue" (and momentarily blue) states will go hog-wild on civilian disarmament.  It won't be at the Federal level or affect the solidly red states, but gun owners in blue and purple states will get clobbered.And that's one of the few issues that actually does unite upper, middle and working class Republicans.</comment>

<comment>>The reason why we are seeing Sanders and Trump rise is because the Establishment on both parties has failed the American people.I think it's actually deeper and simultaneously more interesting and more worrying than that; after all, the establishment has been failing the American people for decades. What's different now is that a great many people no longer buy into the idea that they can really do anything about that within the system as presently constituted. The franchise is losing its placative ability. Elections have served - are intended to serve, really - as a quadrennial escape valve, let people vent their frustrations without actually changing anything. But now the valve's broken, and the frustrations are building up, and they'd better hope they figure out an alternative, cause otherwise eventually it'll be aristocratic-heads on spikes time.</comment>

<comment>This isn't the first time this has happened. The New Deal consensus came along largely thanks to the build-up of an alternative press backed by the labor (and to a lesser extent, socialist) movement. It's not a coincidence that this is all happening during a time of historically-low trust in the media (and institutions generally), making citizen-generated media ascendant. That's also why business interests have been waging a very successful war against unions for 60 years or so.People are breaking free of the propaganda machine. Suddenly, democracy!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the New Deal only really happened because they could see the pitchforks coming into view on the horizon.</comment>

<comment>Bonus marchers.</comment>

<comment>Giving the banks barely a slap on the wrist for the fraud they perpetrated on virtually everyone to the effect of obliterating the world economy and then watching their bonuses continue ever upward even after being bailed out by taxpayers whose own incomes have stagnated for decades was the final straw. The system is rigged and protected by those who have been entrusted to ensure it isn't.</comment>

<comment>And politicians are the ones who put pressure on the banks in the first place to make home loans to people who couldn't afford to pay them back. Of course, you'll never hear this from anyone running for president; it's always somebody else's fault.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, those politicians really twisted those banks' arms to make all that money.I don't care what act you want to blame or which party, the banks were in it for the money, and made cash hand over fist. They weren't worried at all about making those loans, even to people they KNEW couldn't afford it, because they'd just sell off the loans to get turned into CDOs, and not be on the hook when it came time to pay the piper.</comment>

<comment>The right wing is not the only side that has successfully convinced people to vote against their economic interests. I cannot think of a better example of voting against economic interests than Millenials supporting Sanders's single payer health plan. Young people usually have minimal healthcare costs, so any kind of national health plan would be a huge transfer from young to old.</comment>

<comment>No because the old pay too. And the young have children who often DO get sick It's a much fairer system of health care provision and a much more efficient use of resources. It works - I've seen it and experienced it when living away from the US. The insidious fear of getting sick, suffering an accident, or needing hospital care is entirely removed. </comment>

<comment>That's the best summary so far.American manufacturing hasn't collapsed. It's producing more stuff than ever.[1] It's come back from the big dip in 2008. It's just doing it without humans.[2] Manufacturing jobs peaked in 1978 and really started to dive around 2000. Making stuff - manufacturing, construction, mining, and agriculture - is only 14% of the US workforce. What are people going to do all day? For a few decades, the answer was "services", which generated lots of middle-class paper-pushing office jobs. Computers have replaced paper-pushing. "Services" now means low-paying jobs at Uber and Instacart and Amazon, where the office work is mostly automated. More education doesn't help; the US has more people with college degrees than it has jobs for them.We have no clue as a society how to deal with this. This is the real failure of the American political system.Now we have two major candidates who recognize the problem. Neither really knows how to fix it. But getting out of denial is the first step.[1] https://research.stlouisfed.or...[2] http://data.bls.gov/timeseries...[3] http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_tabl...</comment>

<comment>Your lies certainly are well foot-noted.</comment>

<comment>I'm voting for Sanders solely to get more Larry David on SNL.  Well, probably not, probably voting for Hill but we will see.  I voted for John Edwards in 2008 so what the heck do I know.</comment>

<comment>: )</comment>

<comment>The right-wing effort to get people to vote against their economic interests, while using social issues as a cover too has backfired and working class conservative whites are overwhelmingly going to Trump. The collapse of American manufacturing has hit them especially hard.Good points, but you fail to connect (or highlight) a couple of big dots - Illegal immigration and working class wages.  You simply cannot have any real upward growth in wages for unskilled and semi-skilled workers when there is an endless pool of workers willing to undercut the wages demanded by native workers.  In this area, the working class components of BOTH parties have been instructed to vote against their own interests by the respective elites of the two parties, but here the ultra-Democrat-loyal African Americans have been particularly harshly betrayed.</comment>

<comment>That's Pat Caddell's argument.  He has the guts to say it out in the open, though, and not lob it gutlessly from behind a pseudonym like you, though.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the candidate of the forgotten people in our society.Sanders is the candidate of privileged white snowflakes.</comment>

<comment>The unemployed twenty-five year old living at home with tens of thousands in debt because everybody told him he had to go to college to get a job sure as hell doesn't feel privileged. The rich ones vote for Hillary, remember; the one demographic she's got a solid hold on. Be careful; you sound like the sort of people who bleat on about male privilege meaning that the 7-Eleven worker is an oppressor and Hillary Clinton is a victim.</comment>

<comment>A lot of those grads who are in debt are hard workers in useful fields like IT.  It is a shame a lot of them are being forced to train their replacements who come here on H-1B visas.</comment>

<comment>A lot of them are hard workers at Starbucks, too. That's the point. We were told "you have to go to college to get a good job". So we took on debt to go to college. Meanwhile, our "leaders" were shipping all of said good jobs overseas or handing them to H-1B holders making starvation wages.Last I checked, underemployment among recent college graduates is around 30%.https://www.newyorkfed.org/med...And somehow, what you get out of this is that we're "privileged". I guess -- we are privileged compared to, say, children who never got to go to college because corporate greed gave them lead poisoning as children. But the situation still represents a broken promise. And it's not incidental, it's a policy choice.</comment>

<comment>You do have to go to college to get a good job, but not everyone that goes to college is going to get a good job or a job they want right out of college.  I guess they didn't teach logic, economics, or statistics at your school.</comment>

<comment>At least they taught us to read, which is apparently more than you ever learned."Taken as a whole, these trends provide evidence that the job prospects for recent college graduates have indeed worsened, even though the high rate of underemployment over the past few years is comparable to the level seen in the early 1990s. Among those recent college graduates who are underemployed, more are working part-time or in low-wage jobs since 2000, while fewer are working in good non-college jobs. This downward trend in the quality of jobs for underemployed recent college graduates compounds the increase in the level of the group’s underemployment over the past decade."</comment>

<comment>My point is still logical and valid.  You have to go to college to get a good job, but not everyone who goes to college is going to get a good job.  The passage you quoted supports my syllogism.  Again, maybe study harder your next go round in school.  And do you really think that every college graduate until the 2000s got a good job?  The passage specifically states this era is similar to one 20 years ago, which means this downward turn isn't new.  It's unfortunate, but certainly not unprecedented.</comment>

<comment>Seb.....I graduated in 1977. It took me a full year to find a paying job in my field. I tended bar and drove cabs in the meantime. And since then, I have had both good times and bad. Periods where I've done well and periods on unemployment or out of my field.The only real difference is I did not have college debt hanging over me. And this is a problem we really need to solve. Sooner rather than later.</comment>

<comment>I think Sanders's proposals will just make the college education and student debt issue much worse. The last thing we need is more people going to college.  If it were free, then of course everyone would then go to college, Right?  So then the system would just make the post-graduate degrees the new focus.  Then, you'd need even more school in order to get a decent job, and you'd have to borrow for that instead, and so on.  It is all a scam.  We are all overqualified for our jobs.  We need to reform the system by making it so less people go to college and making it affordable for those who do go.  We need to remove the unfairness in the system that favors the privileged kids who do not need to borrow money.  The snowflakes have a huge advantage in the admissions process too.  We need to level the playing field.</comment>

<comment>You sound thoughtful, but what you write is inconsistent. You say we "need to level the playing field" and we do this by reforming the system "making it so less people go to college." How does that work?You write as if a college degree was solely signaling ignoring knowledge and sill acquisition, it's both. And the community college mission is to prepare people for available local jobs. The CC's that I'm familiar with partner with local businesses and industries to do that. My wife left an 'old industry' job with security (at least seemed that way at the time) and retrained in IT at the regional CC, got an internship, and subsequently a good job with a partner business.If CC tuition if free or heavily subsidized it clearly lowers the cost of college and so the debt college students incur.And what's this snow flake crap? You don't enhance your advocacy for the 'forgotten people' by denigrating others who are basically in the same job and financial bind as the group you prefer, but like a different candidate.</comment>

<comment>Most people learn everything they know for their jobs on the job.  Apparently you are unaware of the college education industry's very own propaganda.  It is very proud in the fact that its education is not vocational in nature.  Read what they say.</comment>

<comment>You are painting with a very broad brush. It really depends on what field you are in. But of course you learn a lot about doing your job after you are hired. That isn't just true for college grads. It can be true for someone with 20 years experience, since jobs are always evolving.</comment>

<comment>Free college Works in Nothern Europe. So do healthcare for all.</comment>

<comment>Yes but the ones who come here on a visa and work in IT knew what to study in college and don't so much worry about their pay.</comment>

<comment>Most Disqus comments are overblown. Everything isn't disastrous, terrible, existential, a complete failure... and no President is going to fix all the things that ail you. In our form of government the President is not that strong and Congress is designed (perhaps mis-designed) to be plodding. Comments will actually be stronger absent hyperbole and caricature. Go the Eric Arthur Blair route recommended in "Politics and the English Language". [Grumpy because not enough coffee this a.m.]Encomiums to LittleWillie for a substantive, realistic post on the heavy lift that political activism is.</comment>

<comment>Most journalism and comments in general ignore the forgotten people.  It is largely a smarmy PC conspiracy aimed at tacit promotion of open borders.   There is nothing wrong with promoting open borders.  There are many great things about open borders.  One should just be honest about it.  There is also nothing wrong with wanting to control our borders.  Democrats love regulations on everything except immigration.  It is total hypocrisy and it demonizes the forgotten people and ignores their plight.</comment>

<comment>I think it depends on where you live in the world. Because of the internet, and globalization, we can see how everyone else is living, in the U.S and the rest of the world. If you see how our leaders and their thirst for absolute power and wealth have affected not only Americans but more recently, Iraq, and Afghanistan(but really all over the world) http://www.theatlantic.com/pol...I mean do you really believe we invade these countries because we want "democracy there" or because the U.S is afraid of some one-horse country building nuclear weapons? Do you know we have the most powerful military in the world? By a LONG SHOT by the way. Maybe in your middle class bubble you do fine, but there is a whole world out there, and we  need to TRULY get the hell out their business and help our own people. Also: Why should people who do worse than you accept the crumbs they are thrown? Do corporate CEOs accept o.k profits? Just because it's not you doesn't mean others aren't going through literal life and death scenarios. And for what? Follow the money. Those same countries we fight buy our guns, our weapons, those drug lords we fight those killed for it, costing taxpayers billions. yet we don't have the money for anything? http://www.drugpolicy.org/wast.... Bet your pretty face somebody is getting paid, and it is in someone's interest, to stagnate wages, to start wars and to raise the cost of living for everyone else. To continue to drain the planet of finite resources, when cheaper and safer alternatives exist. Fine if you like it, but there are costs to the so called establishment's "business as usual" http://watson.brown.edu/costso...I don't think Sanders is Jesus reborn, but he's making an important statement, and by supporting him we all make a statement: we see who is running the joint and how they are running it, and we don't support it. I don't care if he doesn't win, if things don't get better for Americans, the establishment will always be challenged. It's healthy to question those in power. It will always happen. It always should.</comment>

<comment>Of course I do. White people have, specifically white, heterosexual men, have been left behind in this world. Overcompensation in order to correct problems that do not actually exist. "Equality" for all.</comment>

<comment>I guess the original title, "Sanders gives voice to young, white ideologues while Trump gives voice to xenophobic dummies" was too long for the banner.</comment>

<comment>Most people on the left oppose our free trade deals, Correct?  Why is that not "xenophobic".  Please explain. I am all ears.</comment>

<comment>Xenophobic is irrational fear of foreigners, not foreign goods.  Being against free trade is characterized as protectionist.</comment>

<comment>When you put up trade barriers, you are "protecting" the workers in the nation state. A border fence is a protectionist policy too, it protects the wages of the workers who are citizens, against those who are not.  Trump, BTW, is not a protectionist, and of course not a xenophobe. Trump wants fair trade policies.  This is a massive difference from Sanders.  Trump also favors immigration.</comment>

<comment>Immigrants take jobs, but they also make jobs. Every immigrant needs a place to live, food, transportation, etc. Buying those things makes jobs for others.And trade creates jobs as well as takes jobs. Lowering trade barriers enhances some industries, damages others.</comment>

<comment>Protectionism in service of ridding the world of the global kleptocrat is no vice.</comment>

<comment>And those the FEEL THE BERN are People across the nation that regularly show up at a job to do everything from the heavy lifting to dirty work and do not have a share of the American Dream as high on the hog as the Clintons and usual pack of Republican suspects that are part of the political-economic-media establishment of both parties that serve the insatiably greedy hoarders of the world’s and nation’s wealth that have no allegiance to the people of any land.  This is why masses of WE THE PEOPLE everywhere are one way or another saying HELL NO and are joined from across the right with Donald Trump and from across the left with Bernie Sanders in insistence that the purpose of governance to which the nation’s Founders set on July 4, 1776:“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That WHENEVER ANY FORM OF GOVERNMENT BECOMES DESTRUCTIVE of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”This birthday announcement or our nation expressed in the Declaration of Independence calls WE THE PEOPLE together for WHENEVER has become DESTRUCTIVE for revolution in ballot in place of bullets to secure the rights creation has equally endowed on us all.</comment>

<comment>to attempt to lump sanders and trump together as "two peas in a pod" shows a lack of insight that is not surprising for the insular "inside the beltway" types that write this kind of stuff. sanders is representing the majority of people, not just millennials. by contrast, trump appeals to the lunatic white-entitlement fringe who want to "take back our country".</comment>

<comment>Regarding fringe - there are probably more uneducated working class whites in this country (Trump's people) than there are upper middle class liberal arts college kids (Sanders people).</comment>

<comment>you assume that all working class white people are racists. by contrast, i don't; trump appeals to the racists.</comment>

<comment>Not all of his followers (who include Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman) are racists.</comment>

<comment>He has Mike Tyson and Dennis Rodman? OMG. This really is a 3 ring circus.</comment>

<comment>Yup.</comment>

<comment>An article well worth reading:http://www.theamericanconserva...</comment>

<comment>Dennis Rodman went to Kim Jong-un's 31 birthday party. Trump really admires Kim.</comment>

<comment>I think you're missing something important.   Yes, Trump appeals to the "lunatic white-entitlement fringe.".   But it's a big mistake to think he *only* appeals to a lunatic white-entitlement fringe.   That's a self-comforting assumption for people who don't like Trump.  However, it's not borne out by polls or (so far) by voting, both of which have shown very broad working class support for Trump.   Even if you don't like Trump - *especially* if you don't like Trump, as i don't - you have to look at the breadth and depth of the real economic frustration that fuels his support.</comment>

<comment>Sanders' campaign is tinged with white entitlement too (though obviously not nearly to the extent as Trump). Take trade--our trade deficit with the European Union is almost as big as our deficit with China, and several times bigger than our deficit with Mexico. But Sanders is against free trade with brown people in China, Korea, other TPP countries, Mexico, yet never complains about our trade with the white folks in Europe.</comment>

<comment>by "white entitlement" i mean racism. that said, the trade deficit with china is more than twice that of the trade deficit with the eu. the issue with china and mexico is that US corporations shut down US plants and relocate the work to plants in mexico and china. i don't know of many US plants that are shutting down to go to the EU.</comment>

<comment>The comparison is invalidated by the fact that European workers are paid as much (sometimes more, occasionally much more) than American workers for work, making trade with them an equitable exchange, even if we buy more from them than we sell. Removing tariffs on goods from countries with lower wages makes US workers compete with them, losing jobs and lowering wages at home. It is essentially a large wealth transfer from the American middle class to the formerly poverty-stricken new middle class of factory workers in China and Mexico. The fact that the countries with high wages are white is not Sanders' doing.</comment>

<comment>Also, the trade deficit with China is around 350b, and with EU 125+b.</comment>

<comment>The idea that Trump's support is mostly among the uneducated may have the ring of truthiness about it but it is false.  Trump outpolls the other Republican candidates among all echelons: those with no college and those with 4-year degrees or more, those earning less that 50K and those earning over 200k, etc.  He polls slightly better among the less-educated and less well-off, but only by 5 points or so.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing in what Trump says to indicate that he thinks his supporters are educated. Actually, there is little to indicate that Trump is educated and a lot to suggest that he isn't.</comment>

<comment>Nonetheless, they are.  And from now on you know that anyone who tells you Trump's supporters are uneducated is either uninformed, or is a liar and thinks you are gullible.</comment>

<comment>Trump/Sanders 2016</comment>

<comment>The Pope has just stated that Donald Trump isn't a Christian, so like Sanders he could be the first non-Christian President.</comment>

<comment>Rubio and Cruz are also pro torture. Are they Christians?</comment>

<comment>Is the Pope a Catholic?  I asked my degree-educated niece that and she replied, "I'm not a Catholic, how would I know?"</comment>

<comment>Does a bear crap in the woods? I'm not a bear biologist, but I'm guessing yes.</comment>

<comment>We know bears are Catholic.  God sent them to eat naughty children who was mocking his prophet Elisha's bald head.</comment>

<comment>Actually, a Pope dissing Donald Trump might actually help him with ardent Protestants.  I am not religious and definitely not Republican, but even I would be more likely to support someone if the Pope was against him...</comment>

<comment>"The new Pope is a humble man, very much like me, which probably explains why I like him so much!"</comment>

<comment>The Pope was preaching the virtues of good Christian behaviour (as he always does) and should a person (like Trump) say the things that he had been reported as saying, then he can't be a ChristianHis statement was a generalised one and was neither specifically aimed at, nor judgemental of, Trump.The caveat he added provided proof that he wasn't aware of all the circumstances.</comment>

<comment>Hillary has at least tried to keep up with Sanders with respect to winning over younger voters by having a plan to reduce, though not eliminate college tuition.On the Republican side its curious that no candidate except Trump has vowed to protect Social Security and Medicare, or to move away from free trade. Given the obvious economic anxiety of the white working class, why have the other Republicans refused to bend on these issues?</comment>

<comment>Younger voters are merely a population segment and not the Holy Grail. Nor are they the font of democratic values and wisdom, as evidenced by how easily young voters are influenced by media and each other, then change their opinions and political leanings over time as they age into 30 and 40 and 50-somethings. Political party strategists and candidates (and pundits) pay attention to the youth vote only when their numbers are large enough to quantitatively matter, not whether what they think is particularly trenchant. i.e., Baby Boomers and now voting age Millennials. No one got all a dither over Gen X. If the upcoming Gen Z are another pig in the python, they'll be courted in the 2018 midterms, when the first of them are eligible to vote and certainly by the 2020 presidential election. If not, the strategists will continue catering to Millennials and ancient Baby Boomers. How to reduce the cost of a college education is not as simple as Sanders claims.</comment>

<comment>Today's young voters are a population segment with a very legitimate beef, that being enormous college debt without the jobs to pay down that debt. And unless we find a way to get them of the hook they will carry that burden for decades, well into their late middle age or beyond.</comment>

<comment>But Trump still supports tax cuts for the rich - just like the other Republicans.And  how many wars will he start?</comment>

<comment>Trump gives voice to those who couldn't care less than Trump just talks simplistic nonsense with no serious solutions just as long as he builds a wall removes millions of Mexicans make deals with everyone including the devil. They are not serious supporters just as Trump isn't a serious candidate. Sanders at least is speaking to people who want to hear a real message of what he intends not read them fairy stories about building an imaginary wall that another country will pay for and sending millions of people to another universe! Two entirely different voices. One as in Trump full of bluster and crap. The other as in Bernie full of hope and desire to help the people of this country.</comment>

<comment>Trump's imaginary wall would be a hell of a lot cheaper and easier to implement than Sanders' imaginary single-payer healthcare.</comment>

<comment>Single-payer could work but Republicans won't hear of it. Like Bernie said those who bang on about health care in other countries have no clue what they are talking about. Unless they have lived there and experienced it they certianly don't know what they are talking about. Hannity, Limbaugh, Fox News are not experts on how systems overseas work. They follow party line of saying how awful it is without knowing the facts. Oh what a surprise that is of course.  As for Trumps great wall of China that is so ridiculous to think the Mexico would pay for it. He keeps saying it because it's what the base want to hear he knows full well that will never happen. The gullible fall for his nonsensical clap trap day in day out.</comment>

<comment>Transpose the vowels, as in Tramp and Sunders, for real linguistics entertainment!</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is the kind of president we all thought Obama would be.  He blew his chance, to show the world what a good first African president should have been.   Weak legacy.</comment>

<comment>How are Sanders and Trump representing the "voiceless"? They are dominating all of the media coverage, and Trump is his party's clear frontrunner.Now Jim Gilmore--that guy's supporters are voiceless.</comment>

<comment>I guess that they're similar, except for the fact that:1) Bernie Sanders has a literal lifetime of experience in politics and an exceptionally long and consistent record of voting and supporting the causes and agenda that he's promoting.2) Donald Trump has no political experience at all, has never held an elected office, and has little to no prior behavior that would indicate he'll follow through on a single thing that he's promising.I personally like Bernie Sanders, but I can absolutely understand why someone would disagree with his views and choose to support another candidate.I cannot understand why anyone thinks that Donald Trump will do a SINGLE thing that he says he will. Poor, uneducated whites love him. Can you show me on thing that he's ever done in his entire life in order to advance the interests of poor uneducated white people? Just one? Even a free buffet at one of his casinos? He's a shallow showman, a childish egomaniac, and a proven liar. He's basically an older and less musical Kanye West.</comment>

<comment>I admire this post of yours. </comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders has also never actually held a real job in the private sector.  He makes Obama and Clinton look like free market buccaneers!  Sanders has literally been on the government teat his whole life!</comment>

<comment>You mean has actually tried to enact change within the system and has not done anything questionable or illegal while doing so? Sounds like an honest man to me.Meanwhile Hillary has been lining her pockets and Obama has been putting out useless healthcare and signing TPP while doing nothing to inhibit big banks from ruining the economy again.</comment>

<comment>I would say that if Trump has demonstrated one thing, it is that he is entirely concerned about whatever he touches that is his own responsibility, turns to gold. He is very concerned about his image and how others perceive him, I think that if he was president, that he would see it as "the united states of trump" within his own mind.At that point his performance as president would be a reflection of himself and I think that his character of egotism would force him to take matters seriously and he would take assertive action to make things happen that benefit the US.So if he was the president, he would own it, just like he owns his company. It might be a bit strange of an ideology but I hope you get my point, instead of it being Trump corp vs other corporations, it would be Trumps America vs other countries. Trump couldn't let his America fail, his pride wouldn't allow it.Personally I prefer Sanders, but I would take Trump over Hillary. The kind of man that may not care much for anyone else normally, but once you are a part of his family, then he owes you a certain loyalty. I think that is how his stance would be.</comment>

<comment>Well, depending on their age, those "voiceless" had a vote since the age of 18 in local, state and national elections. Some of the slow learners spent a couple of decades voting for either the wrong candidate or just alone party lines, if not both.</comment>

<comment>Ahem.  Rush, you have said far worse about this very Pope yourself.</comment>

<comment>It's not just the Millennials. My friends and me are all in the GenX cohort, and almost all of us are enthusiastically for Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Most of what happens in government is the result of the legislative branch.  A win by Trump or Sanders will just exaggerate that bias. The parties in Congress will do what they do and ignore either of them.As a matter of fact, careful analysis of what come out of Congress has shown that the public has virtually no effect on policy: interest group and economic elite positions on issues are what determine outcomes. The US is an oligarchy.https://scholar.princeton.edu/...</comment>

<comment>It certainly is but advocating to do nothing does not help. With an actual liberal president you can more easily put pressure on Congress by telling the population who to vote out of office.</comment>

<comment>"“Having to pay back all that student loan debt is, basically, impossible,” Satasade Roberts, a USC graduate student in social work, said outside Sanders’s event."Thanks for reminding me why I loathe Sanders and his supporters.  I was starting to feel mildly sympathetic, until I saw this quote by someone who took out an "impossible" amount of debt to train for a job in low-wage do-gooderism.  And now this rocket surgeon wants Bernie to take money from those who weren't so foolish to pay for his idiocy.</comment>

<comment>You might want to do some fact checking before you ejaculate your ignorance all at once. Obviously... someone who wants to be a social worker is bad for society /sarcasm.The reason he mentions that it is impossible to pay for, is because the loans are Federal Loans that end up being owned by big banks, that has ridiculous interest rates. It is essentially a tax on students, a tax that the baby boomers generation did not have when they went to school and it was actually affordable.The technical advances we have made and advancements in medicine means that most workplaces are full of 40-50 year old baby boomers who have a ton of experience and in a good number of the cases no college degree, whereas millennials are essentially required to have a college degree in order to join the work force. The costs for school were risen for various reasons, but the deregulation's of markets and access to labor jobs that paid decently that got outsourced by trade agreements left them with no choice but to go to college or get a job at minimum wage.So if you have an actual argument to make, then make it, if not keep your inane point that has no sound logical reasoning to yourself.</comment>

<comment>Eew.  TMI, yo.</comment>

<comment>" in the overwhelmingly white, heavily blue-collar audience." You people in the media ever wonder why you are viewed less favorably than genital warts?  You couldn't just write a column without the left wing jabs, could you.  Last time I looked Bernie is an old white socialist and his crowds look pretty white to me.  You write a column about both men giving voices to the voiceless and right here in your column you show how YOU are part of the problem.  People were too WHITE?  Have you ever written a column saying something like BLM is too black?  You probably don't think you are a racist because for too long you have been told that slamming people for the white color of their skin in NOT racist.  Guess what.  It is.  All those "voiceless" people have had their voices shut down by the likes of you and the rest of the jackals in the PC police state.  Try writing a column about groups that are too black.  I dare you.</comment>

<comment>Here is the simple truth - whether international trade pacts or unfettered immigration - MOST Americans have gotten the raw deal in those agendas and they are sick and tired of our future being either shipped over seas or given to ppl who wander across our border.  The elites still believe that Americans will come to love letting millions of low skilled labor (driving down wages) into the country while continuing to ship jobs overseas through terrible trade agendas.  If you disagree with either of these two premises, you already have 'made your chunk' of wealth, so please just step back and let these two candidates cleanse our society of these nuisances</comment>

<comment>The neat thing is, Trump's republican opponents are so well-funded, as well as ego-maniacal, that none appears eager to withdraw from the race.  "winning" is Trumps' biggest trump card, after all.  The little people want a winner, and by golly, Trump's johnny-on-the-spot.  Best advantage Trump has right now is the collective self-absorption of his clueless opponents, who are too dumb to notice themselves getting steam-rolled.   LOL.  LOL!!</comment>

<comment>Voters know we can’t keep doing the same thing and expect different results; that is the definition of insanity. Americans know that if we don’t change what we are doing there will be no America for our children tomorrow. TRUMP’s passion for America rings true. TRUMP will reverse the export of jobs, manufacturing and money out of America, back into America. Voters know TRUMP’s vision embraces measurable achievable solutions that focus on uniting Americans and making America great again. It’s now time for TRUMP’s colleagues to unite with him to build a strong presidential cabinet.Trump continues to surge in the polls because his common sense message of hope for America is what voters want and AMERICA needs. TRUMP’s disgruntled elitist political opponents, their crony establishments, their special interest lobbyists, and the current arrogant, and confused president, attack TRUMP daily, simply for personal reasons. rather than accept and apologize for their own worthless divisive catastrophes which have bankrupted America at home and politically failed Americans abroad. TRUMP’s criticizers become more irrelevant every day. Their ridiculous attack ads mirror their own stark failures. They are incapable of seeing or admitting to their own failures.  Because voters everywhere see through this nonsense TRUMP’s support increases daily!On Tuesday, November the 8th choose America for Americans. Begin the healing process required to reunite Americans and make America great again for our children, ourselves and future generations. Voters know it’s time to say goodbye to the failed worthless old boys club. Voters, of every party affiliation, are always the true and only catalyst for positive changes. Americans definitely need to clean house. The path to a better future for America could not be clearer. Please get out and vote. Vote to take back America for Americans. Every vote counts. Make your vote count. Vote for change; Vote to reunite Americans and make America great again. It is that simple!</comment>

<comment>Trump?  What is this nonsense. I've listened carefully to Trump, and he is as superficial as it comes.   Just because everyone despises the Republicans and Trump can use that to destroy his rivals, doesn't make him anyone's friend, especially the US voters.   We need another learner in the whitehouse like we need another G.Bush.   The republicans and their twisted world view undermines the US voters and the democracy.</comment>
