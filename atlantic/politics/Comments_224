<comment>The Republicans have done a pretty good job of stoking the resentment of their core constituency that their values are being attacked on all sides, and it looks like at least for now Christian identity politics and specific issues have been sublimated into the more generalized Silent Majority narrative.It'll be interesting to see how they divide up the pie if (probably when) the Republicans win, but right now gay marriage is just another thing they might get around to yelling about between Black Lives Matter and gun control. Probably not a good year for someone who's banking on a strictly Evangelical strategy.</comment>

<comment>Progressives have it easy. They don't have to worry about their values being attacked since they don't have any.</comment>

<comment>Respecting people, their religions, and respecting their equal rights as individuals in society, is a value of progressives.</comment>

<comment>Progressives do not value Christianity - obviously. Only Islam.</comment>

<comment>You're right, we don't value Christianity or Islam, we respect them as a choice people make on how to live their lives.Once again, your failure to understand respect, doesn't surprise me, because you have none for people you disagree with. Is that because of religious belief or pompous narcissism?</comment>

<comment>Ummmm, folks who typically vote one way or the other ?</comment>

<comment>The educated intelligent voters ..... unlike the stupid_democrats</comment>

<comment>They should be asking themselves which candidate can beat Hillary.  Since they aren't, we are going to keep the White House for another 4 years.  Keep nominating wing nuts GOP.</comment>

<comment>In all fairness, McCain and Romney were pretty moderate compared to their insane opponents. Problem for the GOP, is that even their most moderate candidates were still too conservatively blind to America's economic problems.</comment>

<comment>When multiple marriage characters like trump and the KY clerk are heroes to 'social conservatives' or 'christians', should these constituencies not be called something else ?</comment>

<comment>The KY clerk? She's just the liberals wannabe hero for Conservs. She's a nobody. Ok then your super bad heros- Sharpton, Eric Holder, Harry Reid, "clock boy",  Trayvon Martin & co, all the Obama corrupt cronies, and  many others along that line that represent you Dems very well. </comment>

<comment>KY Clerk, Cliven "let me tell you something about the Negros" Bundy, Bundy "God gave me a mission" Sons, Rick Santorum, Herman Cain, Michelle Bachman, Sarah "I can see Russia from my house" Palin, anti-gay bakers, anti-gay teavangelicals, the entire Bush clan, Ronald barely senile Reagan, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, the rest of the 82 republican presidential candidates, Kansas Governor who's bankrupted his state... need I go on?</comment>

<comment>Lame compared to yours who exposed direct corruption and embarrassment to your party - day after day being in the news. And super lame putting outstanding  politicians on your list just because you don't personally like them.Dems own embarrassing corrupt people- no comparison. We could name 100s of  your corrupt foolish  people. How about for starters all of them that run these corrupt, bankrupt,  crime-ridden urban cities. Blue states- mass exodus to Red states. </comment>

<comment>give it a rest...</comment>

<comment>Of course...I'm only responding to replies to me that are unfair. </comment>

<comment>The pre voters are generally fanatics (on both sides) and retirees that are interested.</comment>

<comment>White people shouldn't be allowed to vote if Trump or Cruz is going to be their choice.</comment>

<comment>Get a hobby, or an infertile girlfriend.</comment>

<comment>The big problem Republicans have is they have no platform other than , stop everything from happening and deregulate the money changers on Wall Street. Middle America doesn't care about Gay marriage and abortions. They do care about constant war. When the answer to every foreign policy question is " Bomb them". You have a real problem with people that think.</comment>

<comment>Blue state republicans have a lot of delegates and I would imagine are more focused interest in jobs and immigrants rather than social issues and religion.I think Trump's economic populism is going to have more pull than people realize because it crosses the traditional urban/rural divide in a way other Republican evangelical and social conservative focuses do not.</comment>

<comment>Judging by the data presented, Cruz has an edge in turnout because of his ground game and because it is harder to turn out non-college voters.</comment>

<comment>Trump is popular with those who are on the same wave length about arming more and more people, deporting millions of Mexicans, refusing entry to all Muslims. They are the minority not the majority but that is the type of crowd Trump draws which is not a true reflection of the country. Trump may well end up being the nominee but he certainly won't be the POTUS. His latest endorsement by Sarah Palin is nothing for Trump to get excited about. Sarah Palin was the death knell for John McCain.</comment>

<comment>Challenge to Conservatives!What moderate positions did Mitt Romney campaign on in 2012?What moderate positions did McCain campaign on in 2008?</comment>
