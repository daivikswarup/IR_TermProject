<comment>"Trout usually tells candidates that 70 percent of people with disabilities are unemployed, and then asks them what they intend to do about it."Should it not be up to the people who want a job to figure out how to get one?  Or better yet start their own company?  Also, this sounds like a man who has never considered the possibility that maybe what the government has already done is the reason for the problem (the law of unintended consequences).  Finally, his statistic is a useless number without telling me what percentage of disabled people are on permanent disability insurance and are unable to work.</comment>

<comment>It's not always easy for a person with a disability to gain employment. Even though it's illegal for an employer to discriminate against someone with a disability, it's still a huge problem. We are getting rejected on the simple fact that we are disabled. Employers only see the disability, and the potential burdens that may come with it, not what we can do for their company.</comment>

<comment>John832 wait until you get to be in your late 50's and are diagnosed with an illness and your job dumps you for not being able to perform anymore. Then go out and interview and see what you have to say then. Empathy is a learned skill. Personally, I think that people who have no empathy have a disability...narcissism</comment>

<comment>I'll be retired by my late 50's, but if I get sick and can't work before then my disability insurance will provide me $4900 a month in income until I am eligible for Social Security at age 60 something.</comment>

<comment>How much would your disability insurance cost the average worker per year? And what is the average income of the average worker?</comment>

<comment>Mine costs roughly $1k a year for $5k in coverage starting 365 days after an injury and continuing until age 65.  Non-cancel-able and with same occupation coverage.  Your average worker probably earns half what I do.</comment>

<comment>If your earnings were roughly 1/2 what they are now, for a family income, would you recommend that insurance for a thirty year career?</comment>

<comment>That depends on whether Social Security disability is enough for your family to get by on.  For me it is insufficient for the lifestyle I wish to live.</comment>

<comment>That's a little harsh. I would be interested in knowing how many disabled people are on disability and how many can work. I would think changes to the current disability system would help disabled people work as much as they could while realizing that many could never work year round full time.</comment>

<comment>Wow you are clueless about the stigma disabled people face in the workplace. Most disabled people want to work and are denied that opportunity based on stereotypes and stigma. To suggest every disabled person become an entrepreneur in response to this is ridiculous.  </comment>

<comment>What you probably don't understand is that people with disabilities who want to work, assuming they're able to break through the attitudinal barriers that have traditionally made them subject to discrimination in the labor force, often have to do a dance with Social Security and Medicaid to be able to afford having a job in the first place.In other words, there are complex issues only politics can address behind much of the disability employment problem. Political job one is not punishing people with disabilities for working. If that problem is not solved, then we are essentially consigning millions of able, ready and willing workers to poverty and non-productivity.It's truly uninformed, unhelpful and amazingly naive to suggest the problem lies in people with disabilities alone.</comment>

<comment>It's good to see this site promoting people who ask politicians questions on video, but the question they asked Jeb is very weak. As a result, it has less than 200 views.If the questioners want more views and want to have a much greater impact, ask much tougher questions designed to reveal the flaws in what specific candidates have already said.You aren't going to get anywhere asking Trump about his supposed mocking of the NYT reporter: his followers aren't going to believe it (or are going to support it) and he's going to deny it. So, you have to be smarter about it. Ask about a flaw in one of Trump's stated plans and keep doing that in order to erode his support.See 24ahead.com/s/question-authori... for dozens of very tough questions. They're mostly about immigration but once again you have to be smart about these things. Sometimes the best way to oppose someone isn't on your issue but on an issue where they're weak. Tweet me if you need help.</comment>

<comment>Can't wait to see what Trump would say when asked a question by them. Would he incorporate it into a comedy routine (sorry I meant a stump speech) later?</comment>

<comment>Thanks for this great coverage! To see what the candidates are actually saying, go to www.TheRespectAbilityReport.or.... That is where you can see more than 100 news stories on the intersection of politics and disability.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is talking about the issue that is important to the disability community - home services !   The grassroots disability rights organization called ADAPT has been fighting to demand the right to home services as a civil right since 1990.  Now there is federal legislation called the Disability Integration Act.  Nobody has asked the candidates about this bill !   Also, no candidate has put forward a platform dealing with disability issues in general !    Why is that ?</comment>

<comment>We at RespectAbility have asked all the candidates to fill out a questionnaire on a variety of disability issues. The Sanders campaign has responded and we've posted it to www.TheRespectAbilityReport.or.... We'll continue to post the others as they come in. We have confirmations from the Bush, Christie, Clinton and Trump campaigns and will post them as well.</comment>

<comment>Gimme gimme...</comment>

<comment>There are different sources of income depending on when a person becomes disabled. Some people get Social Security Disability while others get Federal Employees Disability Benefits or Worker's Compensation or benefits from private insurers. The problem with any and all of these is that they penalize a disabled person for trying. If someone with disability earns a little, they often lose their benefits and come out worse off than if they did nothing. The only thing these sources of disability income seem to care about is finding an excuse to cut off paying benefits and they make it very hard to get them back if employment doesn't work out. It really isn't fair to those with disabilities who want to try and do a little better for themselves. The federal government even taxes disability benefits which penalizes those who are already have a lot of problems making ends meet. There is a lot that needs to be addressed.</comment>
