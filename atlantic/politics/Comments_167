<comment>Rand? Rand Paul, is that you?</comment>

<comment>There are still pro-life progressives, in Catholic circles often adhering to what is called a "Seamless Garment" approach to life from conception to natural death, advocating for a lot more than just against abortion.</comment>

<comment>It's not a "pro-life" movement. It's an anti-choice movement.</comment>

<comment>there are many of these people who would happily call themselves democrats if only you'd let them</comment>

<comment>One time i saw Robert George say something to the effect of, "I actually like much of the Democractic Party's domestic/economic policy, they just have to stop killing babies!"</comment>

<comment>No one kills babies, idiot </comment>

<comment>Of course they do, every time an abortion is committed a baby is killed in his or her mother's womb. Now, you and I might disagree with whether or not this killing is justified or not (aka whether it is just "killing" or is indeed "murder") but that you would deny that a species of the homo sapien community is killed at every abortion is just obtuse.</comment>

<comment>Not surprising a moron doesn't know what the definition of a baby is </comment>

<comment>Okay, I don't know why you're being so disrespectful. Baby is a non-scientific term; if you would prefer that i say that a zygote, embryo, fetus, etc is killed that's fine. It doesn't make a difference to the argument though; the common denominator between all of these is that they are all stages in the maturation of an organism that belongs to the species homo sapien</comment>

<comment>Yes, but only one of the above can survive without the assistance of a woman's body.  It's fine if you don't want an abortion. But stop trying to inflict your ignorance on others </comment>

<comment>Are you saying anyone who can't survive without the help of another should die? Like most children or toddlers? Or people who are unconscious? Or people who got hurt enough to need medical attention? Or codependent people? Or mentally ill people who have incurable diagnosis? Or anyone who gets any kind of cancer and doesn't own a radiation machine?Please, help me justify your logic so it makes sense and doesn't sound as ignorant as you accuse others of being.</comment>

<comment>Are you really trying to compare children to a fetus?  That's stupid, but Okey?  See being a father myself i can easily see the difference. The our child, while still a fetus was growing with the assistance of my wife with her consent.  Once he was born he still needed care, but by that time he was no longer directly reliant on her body.  I was capable of taking care of him, as her his grandparents and uncles and aunts.  Persons have the right to deny others the use of their bodies.  If you don't believe in that, I'm coming for you're kidney, liver and lungs. Lol </comment>

<comment>What about the other examples I gave? I think you'll have problems with those too.You're saying the weaker thing doesn't deserve life it it's inconvenient for the caregiver and the weaker thing needs to be dependent on the care of another directly. By doing so, you're focusing on the person's rights who is providing the care. You're not focusing on the need of the recipient of other people to care for the recipient. You're actually not addressing the examples completely, and shifting the focus. I think persons have the right to deny others the use of their bodies - except that right is limited just like any other right we posses in society. For some reason, I can't take action that would harm someone who is defenseless. If I negligently fumigate a building and don't look for people in there, there is a sleeping person in the building, I'm actually guilty because of my omission in that situation. Or if a person in a coma or a person who is a small child and can't understand were in there. This is a somewhat moral argument as well, but if those kinds of people couldn't fend for themselves, are you saying they shouldn't be protected? I doubt that. But you have a different line on what is a person than most people.I also can't negligently be inactive and cause harm to people by omission either. Leaving someone who can't take care of themselves to die is negligence if the person has a right to life. If you leave your child to their own devices, you're negligent and will go to jail, regardless of whether that child needed you moment to moment for a nutrient supply. Even if the child could wander around and ask for help. Isn't that a violation of your rights to have to provide for that kid?Your logical fallacy is one of a sliding scale. The logical conclusion is you allow people you like to be protected, but not people who are a burden. That's the difference I can easily see.You seem to think this umbilical cord is worth something, but what about people needing machines to live, like the still alive people needing an iron lung? They need people to help them, and won't live without the help of others. So... how is that different?</comment>

<comment>None of that made any sense so I'm going to ignore it.  A child is not the same as a fetus, so naturally you can get in trouble for neglecting a child.  Anyway, I'm now expecting you to go donate a kidney to someone who needs one.  They clearly have a right to it...</comment>

<comment>That's amazing! You're inability to follow your own logical conclusion is the reason you're not going to reply? A child is also different from an adult. Just because there's a difference, you can treat one worse? What about people with different skin color? They're different. Or different cultures? Or different genders? That's an obvious difference to you too, right? Or mentally handicapped people? They're different than adults, so we should be able to kill them if they need help from people? All these people are different from a baby not out of the womb yet. Where's your line, and why that line?</comment>

<comment>No. I couldn't follow, because what you posted was an incoherent, rambling word soup.And clearly a line can be drawn at viability, as it currently is.  If you wanna force my wife to donate get body as an incubator for am unwanted pregnancy, I'm coming for you're organs.  Here are people out there who desperately need them.  What is your life more important than theirs? </comment>

<comment>You would be doing yourself a favor if you looked up "strawman argument". It is known as a "logical fallicy". That is why you failed.</comment>

<comment>A fetus is living, a fetus if it come from human parents is human, a fetus has a different DNA set them the mother so it is a separate organism and worth protecting under the law. What a sad view of humanity you have</comment>

<comment>It's a DNA vehicle that the Consciounsness enters w the first breath. Perhaps it would be less confusing if religions hadn't stripped Jesus' Teachings on Reincarnation from the 100 versions of the Bible they've created. They can still be found in the Sacred Texts in the Monastaries of Tibet where he spent 17 years of his life. See Scientific Research above. They made it clear in 1992, "LIFE DOES NOT START AT CONCEPTION". Everything in the Universe=ENERGY including LIFE CONSCIOUNESS, which enters the DNA vehicle w the first breath. Parenting is among the highest of responsibilities being failed by 98-99%. REturning souls are to be trained in how Universal LAWS operate; instead every religion is totally and completely failing the real program to master these LAWS. They make up whatever crock of nonsense they want.</comment>

<comment>Sorry Dan, but being human is not the same as being a human. Simple English grammar.BTW, my hair is human but not a human.</comment>

<comment>BS. A person has entered the world and enjoys its rights. A fetus hasn't and doesn't.The funny part is those most adamant about not allowing abortions are also the same ones who don't want to see any benefits to help those same children grow up healthy.</comment>

<comment>Ok, so entering the world is how you determine rights. Ok. So a fetus entering the world at 21 weeks has rights, but a fetus not outside the womb at 30 weeks doesn't have rights? What if the mother dies, but the baby inside hasn't and is viable? No rights, correct?The funny part about your comment is your completely tautological, completely unfounded sweeping generalization that shows your inability to handle a lot of nuance.If you read the article, it was the Catholic church, one of the biggest charitable organizations in the world in the tonnage of food and medical supplies it gives to the needy, who were the most adamant about not allowing abortions AND helping children grow up healthy. Read the article you're responding to, please.</comment>

<comment>OK, so if I BS something too, I can look as stupid.When you can show me some of those 21 /wk fetuses that were born and lived I'll concede. Otherwise you're just pulling it out your butt.</comment>

<comment>Um my wife's and my baby would not have survived long with out our bodies changing him, feeding him, burping him. Everybody needs someone else body to survive. And yes a fetus, infant, toddler, teenager adult, are all human persons. What a sad view of humanity you have. </comment>

<comment>You could have hired a nanny to do the same. Only a complete idiot would compare changing diapers with carrying an unwanted pregnancy to term.  The really sad part is scumbags who want force their ignorance on others.  Don't want an abortion, don't have one. </comment>

<comment>Right a nanny could have done it. But some people need others to keep them alive which is no means to keep abortion legal. The life of the unborn matter as much as your and mine. Ignorance is believing that unborn babies are not personuch like some thought Jews were not people or black were 3/5ths of a person.</comment>

<comment>You can believe what your like.  But thankfully you'll never be able to force you ignorance on others </comment>

<comment>How many women expecting to give birth refer to the fetus as a baby?  Are they ignorant too?</comment>

<comment>How many women do you want to enslave and force to carry unwanted pregnancies to term?You forced birth terrorists are disgusting. Thankfully y'all are too stupid and poor to live in prosperous states like the one I love in </comment>

<comment>See, I don't think a simple dual view of this issue is helpful.  I think policy needs to respect the humanity of both mother and fetus.  But abortion policy is always whatever policy the women in a society support.  So in Iceland, the requirement for strong justification for all abortions (and social justification, such as youth of mother, ends at 16 weeks) is a decision women have effectively made, as is the decision of Sweden to severely curtail abortion after 18 weeks gestation.Every time one compares Iceland to terrorists I wonder if we are on the verge of another Viking age....</comment>

<comment>See comments above. The DNA Vehicle is NOT a baby.</comment>

<comment>I think you might want to flesh out your arguments beyond "No one kills babies" (which is very broad and highly inaccurate and, from a logical point of view, can be refuted by finding a single person killing a single baby) and "idiot" (which doesn't actually count as an argument...or at least not one that a civil person would use).</comment>

<comment>He is being an ideologue, a sophist, and is quite uncharitable in the free exchange of ideas. Some people are not worth trying to discuss things of significant import.</comment>

<comment>I assume you feel that way because he doesn't believe a fetus is a baby.</comment>

<comment>I disagree very much with that assumption actually. My problem is that he does not seem to think anyone who disagrees with him can be motivated by good will or reason. He doesn't treat ideological opponents with respect, and with that attitude, one could go his or her entire life without ever having to question any of their most deeply held beliefs. I have my own blindspots and fail as well, but it seems evident by the name calling and his overall tone, that he does not care about the getting to the truth of a matter, or respecting the dignity of his interlocutors as such.</comment>

<comment> it seems evident by the name calling and his overall tone, that he does not care about the getting to the truth of a matter,Hhmmm, that goes well with your earlier comment - He is being an ideologue, a sophist, and is quite uncharitable in the free exchange of ideas.Now, you were saying ... ?</comment>

<comment>I'm pro choice because I think the woman's rights trump the fetus's --my own line would be that the fetus doesn't have full human rights until it has a sufficiently developed brain to be capable of having emotions or feeling pain.  I don't know when that is and it's fuzzy, but at least a fetus in the early stages wouldn't qualify.</comment>

<comment>Yes, we oppose people efforts to terminate the life of a human organism, from conception to natural death. What is wrong with that?</comment>

<comment>It's none of your goddamned business what a woman decides in this context.</comment>

<comment>Killing human life is a society's business, there are already laws against murder. Also, if it's an anti-choice movement (which it is), then pro-choice is pro-death. Ever since I was a kid, I have never been able to wrap my head around how it's possible to demonize someone that is against killing human life. Like, we just want people to live and not die. It really, simply boggles my mind. Sure you can differ in opinion, but the hostility, and "bigotization" of the the pro-life people really just reveals a deep insecurity pro-choice people have in their own moral conviction about abortion. It's as if they can't deal logically with a sensible discussion of the facts, so they just resort to "you hate women, you horrible bigot", as a diversion.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, as my experience on this thread all day yesterday showed me, you about summed it up.</comment>

<comment>You're projecting (to a comical degree). Among other things...And the strong criticism of anti-choicers (it's not "demonization," since demons have nothing to do with it) is a response to their efforts to legislate their spiritual beliefs into laws that impose themselves on the autonomy of others (which in this context refers to women and their right of self-determination).</comment>

<comment>While the pro-life cause agrees with Christian spirituality, it really has nothing to do religion. Being anti-choice has as much to do with spirituality as being anti-rape, or anti-murder has to do with spirituality. It stems from our common sense, morality, whatever you call it. In regards to women's autonomy and self-determination, if it infringes upon another's autonomy and self-determination then it is wrong. A fetus is by definition not a woman's body, it is literally another body, with its own DNA. These things ought to be very obvious and it's odd that they need to be explained.If you want to argue against a prolifer's stance, which you obviously have a right to do, you can't construct caricatures of our worldview to attack, you have to be on the same page as us, as far as our thought process goes. Prolifers aren't attacking women's autonomy because we don't believe the fetus falls within that domain. The act of murder doesn't change depending on the age of the victim.</comment>

<comment>Thank you, a competent messenger for the anti-abortion cause. There are far too many non-sequitirs about things like "trying to oppress women" when we have this discussion. There is absolutely no question that a new, distinct, self-integrating organism of the species "homo sapiens" begins its life at the moment of conception. The real question is whether or not this is a meaningful grounds for human dignity. For those who believe in some sort of body-self dualism, then there is no "person" until a far later (and fairly arbitrary) point in time. For those of us who reject this dualism, personhood (or being an entity with dignity) and humanity are inseperable. This si not the place to debate metaphysical positions on personhood, but needless to say, some of the logical consequences of the former position can be quite repugnant.</comment>

<comment>Oh come off it with the "DNA" angle. The idea that a blob of unique DNA is de facto autonomous is patently absurd.And keep your religion and/or spirituality out of the Legislature. Your beliefs are irrelevant in the context of someone else's bodily autonomy.</comment>

<comment>The fact that you deny the "DNA angle" is truly anti-intellectual; Not even any legitimate pro-abortion philosopher will deny this premise, in fact Peter Singer insists on setting the record straight that fetuses are "humans", but he does not concede that they are "persons", seeing them as different types of things. I don't know why you are so uncharitable in debate, it's honestly quite obnoxious. And please, point out a sentence of mine that invokes a theological proposition.</comment>

<comment>The DNA in a drop of my blood is "human," too.And there is no justification of the anti-choice position that is not transcendentally motivated (not necessarily Xtian), though many try to couch their position in pseudo-scientific terms.</comment>

<comment>The DNA in your blood exists because it is part of a whole organic reality that is your body. In addition to other parts of your body, it contributes to your maturation over time as a person. You only listed a premise but never stated the implication/conclusion of the point so I'm not quite sure what to say to that.As for the scientism implicit in your second point, do you really think your moral worldview is informed by purely descriptive statements of "science" for lack of a better word? Try to justify a woman's right to an abortion, or any person's right to anything for that matter, with purely descriptive claims, you won't get very far. If "one ought not to kill innocent human beings" is "transcendental" and therefore somehow illegitimate, then the whole project of ethics is toast, it's all will to power.</comment>

<comment>Humanism would disagree.And the right of self-determination needs no justification, but a desire to restrict such certainly does (and lacks it in this case).</comment>

<comment>What do you mean by humanism would disagree?? I can't engage that because you have essentially told me nothing. You haven't defined your terms, and you haven't put forth an affirmative argument for a point.As for the second part, it is getting into waters that are just to thick to handle in a combox. I just don't understand why pro-abortion folk can't all concede that a human being's biological life begins at conception. That doesn't mean you have to agree necessarily that he or she becomes a member of the moral community at that point (though I obviously do). There are plenty of approaches to defending the legality of abortion that affirm this well-established scientific fact that every important pro-abortion philosopher will admit. To deny it is like when Christian apologists affirm young-earth creationism. It is an unnecessary foray into utter anti-intellectualism and perpetuation of ignorance.</comment>

<comment>It's the woman's choice. Always was, always will be.</comment>

<comment>What is her choice? Her choice to do what? That is a rather incomplete thought. I support a man's right to take.</comment>

<comment>Are you really that dense?</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate America?</comment>

<comment>Blob? That is what you think of people as blobs? What a sad view of humanity you have.</comment>

<comment>No, because "people" are born.</comment>

<comment>>The idea that a blob of unique DNA is de facto autonomous is patently absurd.I don't believe anyone is de facto autonomous, at least not as the Enlightenment thinkers assumed.  We don't survive infancy or live long in old age without the help of others.  We are, as Aristotle noted, social animals.Now, I am living in Sweden right now and would note that of the Scandinavian countries, Denmark has the most liberal abortion rights -- abortion is limited to 20 weeks pregnancy (Sweden limits to 18 weeks, Norway to 12 weeks, and Iceland requires medical or social justification for all abortions, with social justification limited to 16 weeks).  I think these policies are all more humane for both mothers and fetuses than we have in teh US, and I would like to see the states pass bills that:1.  Focus on early access, 2.  Ban after 16 weeks or so, and3.  Have a severability clause rolling back the first if the second is struck down.</comment>

<comment>Killing human life is so much a society's business that there are laws in favor of the death penalty, and I'd be willing to bet money that you're a supporter of those laws.  You're not pro-life, sir or madam, you're pro-the-lives-of-everybody-you-approve-of, and so is everyone else.  What gets on my nerves is that you set yourself up as some kind of righteous exception.  Well...I don't buy it; never have, never will.Have a nice day.</comment>

<comment>Another diversion. What does the death penalty (which I don't support) have anything to do with this discussion about abortion? You haven't addressed a single one of the issues I brought up, instead, you just randomly decided that I support the death penalty and then criticized the figment of your imagination you produced.We're talking about abortion. Don't set yourself up as some kind of righteous exception to logical discussion, please find something you disagree with in my posts and explain why.</comment>

<comment>We're talking about people dying here; we're not talking about anything else — that's what you say yourself.  So stick to the subject, you, and don't try to change it.As for the meat of the matter, I will address it when you do.  I expect we'll both be waiting a pretty long time.</comment>

<comment>A fetus is not a "people". Inventing your own definition doesn't change that.</comment>

<comment>Hey, don't wag the finger at me.  Scold the pro-life folks; what I'm doing is, I'm addressing them on their own terms.</comment>

<comment>Prove that they are not people!</comment>

<comment>Prove? Name your dictionary. Not one recognized English dictionary calls a fetus a "people."I would ask that you prove you aren't stupid, but I'm too late.</comment>

<comment>Subjecting a certain class of people to be allowed to be killed is a societal problem. </comment>

<comment>Derp.</comment>

<comment>If you call murder a choice...</comment>

<comment>Drama queen.Maybe you shouldn't be diluting the meaning of the term "murder?" It seems to make some particularly-unhinged True Believers feel justified in killing adults to defend the "sanctity" of life.</comment>

<comment>Good... now think a little more and you'll understand why it's "pro-life" not "anti-choice".</comment>

<comment>Except it's not (in practice).</comment>

<comment>You pro slavery folks are disgusting.  Thankfully scalia is dead and Roe V Wade is now ensured.  You lose</comment>

<comment>How ironic.</comment>

<comment>Clearly you don't know what that word means, idiot </comment>

<comment>Don't you have anything better to do? Or the only thing you can do to feel better about yourself is insulting people you don't know on the internet and pretend superiority while doing it?</comment>

<comment>In a way i actually do agree with the former clause (though not the latter). I wish my side would call ourselves anti-abortion, and the other-side pro-abortion. Instead, both sides try to wrap our positions in sweet, juicy euphemisms that have a lot of baggage (everyone has heard the old "well you'r just pro-life when.../well you only care about choice when...").</comment>

<comment>It's not a "pro-choice" movement because it doesn't include the choice of the father, the fetus, or the taxpayer. It's a pro-abortion movement.</comment>

<comment>The choice of the father is not relevant, unless he's the one who is pregnant.</comment>

<comment>Not Catholic, but what else do you call a view that abortion is wrong along with capital punishment and (usually) war?  Where care for the poor is commanded?Or is family emphasis anti-choice?</comment>

<comment>The abortion part is none of your business, which is kinda what "choice" implies.</comment>

<comment>I am not sure about that.  I think Aristotle was right in his argument that we are social animals, and that society is formed when procreative families come together to solve joint problems.Abortion plays into those problems in different ways in different places and I reject both a pro-choice position which glorifies the choice between poverty and abortion with no other alternatives, and which refuses to discuss how abortion liberates men from women (by putting a moral sense of responsibility on women along with the choice of abortion), and thus can also disempower women.  And I also reject a pro-life position that is essentially pro-birth into a heartless world.I think the obligation of policy is to respect the humanity of both mother and fetus.  American policy seems intent on denying humanity to both in the name of total victory of one side or the other.  Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Japan, and Indonesia, despite differing on where and when abortion may be legal, do a better job.</comment>

<comment>Many Catholics will oppose abortion on the surface, but have little problem with getting one if needed. That is no different than the right wing anti-choice will travel to another State to have an abortion.</comment>

<comment>Hypocrisy is the tribute that vice pays to virtue.</comment>

<comment>The Church is a hospital for sinners. Not a hotel for saints.</comment>

<comment>"Sin" is a patently-absurd concept.And there are specific kinds of hospitals for those who talk to entities that no one else can perceive (because God is funny that way, apparently).</comment>

<comment>If sin is an absurd concept, so it "moral" and "immoral", "right" and "wrong"</comment>

<comment>It doesn't appear you did well in English. Unless, if you were home schooled, then that would explain it.Elsewhere, I posted an explanation of a strawman argument. That applies equally here. "Right and wrong" have definite meanings that are polar opposites. Sin, on the other hand, as well as "moral and immoral", are subjective words used to infer one's personal values that others are expected to live by or are used to judge others behavior.</comment>

<comment>Except that "right and wrong" do not have definite meanings that are polar opposite. Case in point- Say I believe it is right to murder, at the point of conviction, every rapist, bar none. Others believe that to be a wrong. "Right" and "wrong" are simply euphemisms for "moral" and "immoral", or vice-versa. Someone else's right can very easily be someone else's wrong.Only time "right" and "wrong" have polar opposite meanings is when "righty-tighty, lefty-loosey", or something along those lines, comes into play. Otherwise, "right" and "wrong" are inseparable from morality.F*cking idiot.</comment>

<comment>And it is wrong to kill people even the unborn.</comment>

<comment>If you don't want a woman to abort her fetus, why don't you volunteer your uterus to carry the fetus to term?A fetus is not a people.</comment>

<comment>Mr Fusion:Do you think Norway's ban of elective abortion after 12 weeks is a human rights violation?  What about Sweden's ban at 18 weeks?  Denmark's ban at 20 weeks?  Iceland's requirement that all abortions have strong justification?</comment>

<comment>Derp.</comment>

<comment>So a guy who shoots students at a school did not sin?</comment>

<comment>No, he committed murder.</comment>

<comment>The good news is Obamacare does cover mental health treatments. The bad news is it appears you haven't taken advantage of that yet.</comment>

<comment>You're adorable.</comment>

<comment>Fail to see the point. Many people oppose gang violence and theft, but may resort to these options if needed. It does not follow that theft should be made legal. This was no more than an ad hominem. Why don't we quit psychoanalyzing the anti-aboriton community and look at the arguments of each side's merits?</comment>

<comment>Apparently you don't understand what an ad hominem is.The rest of your post is equal gooblygook.</comment>

<comment>I do understand what an ad hominem is, and i agree i made a mistake using it in that situation. The point i wsa trying to make is that if a person holds that something is immoral and ought to be outlawed, he or she later committing that act does not invalidate the initial position, that it is immoral and ought to be outlawed. For example, I may think shoplifting should be illegal and is immoral. Then later, my personal integrity may be weak and i shoplift from a store. Just because I failed to live up to my standards, it does not mean that stealing is now morally acceptable and ought to be legalized, or, for that matter, that i ought to support it's being legal.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't seem like a liberal conservative issue.Its a life vs death issue.Abortion takes a life no matter how much pro-choicers say otherwise. You can and justify the execution but it still is one.SImple, the baby is alive at contraception, dead things don't grow</comment>

<comment>Let's follow this logic and see where it takes us:Cancer treatment is a life vs death issue. Removing a cyst takes life no matter how much anti-cancerists say otherwise. You can and justify the execution but it still is one.SImple, the cyst is alive at its inception, dead things don't grow.</comment>

<comment>Cysts will never, can never, grow into a living, breathing, thinking human being. The child in the womb, however, can. As long as something doesn't go wrong in the womb, or the child is murdered, the child will come to full term and be born.To compare a cyst to a human says all that needs to be said about your understanding of humanity. In that case, I suppose you wouldn't mind killing yourself? You know, because you clearly have no problems with killing the only truly innocent people in this world.</comment>

<comment>How cute - you equal unborn fetuses to fully developed humans.</comment>

<comment>What about a 20 week old fetus that can survive outside the womb - what is their worth? What about the worth of an elderly alzheimer patient? Or an amputee? Who is this fully developed person, by what standards do you measure them? If an unborn fetus is unworthy of protection, what happens to the humans in the spectrum between fetus and "fully developed"?Utilitarian consequentialist machiavellians are the worst.</comment>

<comment>Except that they cannot. Only some 23 week old fetuses - if they are very, *very* lucky.Gotta love how pro-slavery folks try to sneak in a whole bunch of bogus science.</comment>

<comment>The ad hominem discredits you; I am acquainted with a child born at 5 months (she is blind, but very happy to be alive). You answered none of my points, and they still stand: you introduced a spectrum of worth to decide who is and who is not a human being. Who is and who is not a fully developed human?Anyway, it's alright you called me a hateful slur and ignored my points. I was pro-choice until about two years ago, and I said some nasty things in my time. Good lessons in humility.</comment>

<comment>It is extremely rare that a baby born at 23 weeks gestation will survive. If they do, they will have a life time of physical ailments.Being human is not the same as being a human. My hair is human but not a human. That tumor I had out before Christmas was human, but it wasn't a human.BTW, if you truly believe that a fetus should be brought to term, why don't you volunteer your uterus instead of insisting on someone else doing it.</comment>

<comment>As I already said, I know someone who survived, and they are glad to be here despite their blindness. Your suggestion that physical ailments are a reason to eliminate people has an ugly tinge of eugenics.Your hair cells will not grow into a human. A fetus will. Don't be dense. Your hair is a part of you; you did not start life as a hair. Remove the embryo from your mother, remove your existence. This is anti-science nonsense. They don't try to breed new pandas out of hair, unless it's Jurassic Park fantasy.Promoting responsibility for one's actions, be it cleaning up after an oil spill or accepting responsibility for the life one has created, is sound ethics. Promoting techno-utopian solutions that undermine the importance of the human body, our attachment to our roots, and treat us as lumps of meat is not sound ethics. And, for the record, I've worked in foster care and my goal is to adopt as many unwanted children as I can meaningfully care for; though, of course, I am well aware I will never replace their birth families.</comment>

<comment>Your stem cells could, though.</comment>

<comment>Good for you. Now volunteer your uterus and carry a fetus to term. Then there won't be as many unwanted children in the world.</comment>

<comment>Who do not want children?</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your eloquent, patient, loving, human responses to ugly ideas and some people's attempts to demonize you here. They fail to do so because you won't stoop to their level.  It's amazing how hard people resist the fact that their lives mean something. </comment>

<comment>No, I don't thank you for trying to force your selfish and intransigent views on the bodies of my wife, my daughters and every woman I know.Do not judge others unless you are prepared to be judged.</comment>

<comment>A kind word of encouragement means very much. Thank you. There have been a few polite commenters. As it is, I've heartily earned all the vitriol. I was pro-choice until a few years ago. I said some inane things with a lot of passion myself; I'll never get to thank or apologize to most of the people who changed my mind, but they slowly changed it all the same. So best to keep going, though it isn't very rewarding.Again, thank you.</comment>

<comment>Because that is against all logic, rational thought and science and biology.</comment>

<comment>What do you mean brought to term?</comment>

<comment>As I thought, you have no idea of what pregnancy is. Yet that doesn't stop you from inflicting your morals on women.</comment>

<comment>The right question isn't whether or not the fetus is a person; it's whether a pregnant woman has the right to decide who can use her body.People who need kidney transplants are unquestionably people; people who need liver or bone marrow transplants are people who will die without those transplants. Does that mean we can give them *your* parts without needing your permission?</comment>

<comment>The question is not just about rights. It's also about responsibility. And if you want people to agree that women have the right to their own body, then you should also take seriously that it's still ending a life. What the ---- happened to the rare part? What about teaching people that sex has consequences, and with privilege comes responsibility?And if you can't see the difference b/t two strangers and a mother-child, then I can't help you. We're not just lumps of interchangeable meat. I'd have more sympathy for the cause if it acknowledged how many women do experience regret, lifelong, because they are aware that pregnancy and abortion are not equal to a bone marrow transplant, however much people may twist themselves into pretzels.</comment>

<comment>The simplistic assertion that it's "ending a life" rather than preventing one is one of the reasons why women who take it too seriously suffer those regrets.</comment>

<comment>I've had a miscarriage. Many of my friends and relatives have had miscarriages. I don't think, but know, that all these women would really like it if men don't tell them their grief and their loss isn't imaginary. Because it isn't.</comment>

<comment>And you regret your miscarriage because you wanted the child.It's not your place to tell a woman who experiences a miscarriage with relief that she should be feeling regret instead.</comment>

<comment>Of course it's not my place to tell her that! But it's also not my place to pretend it isn't a life. Human life is always fragile. It is especially fragile in the early days. Losing an embryo at 5 weeks is different than losing a 5 year old. But they are both human; they are both worthy of our love and tears. And while some women may not feel regret, and that's their right, it's not okay to pretend that it's not a human in question.I don't want the love we proclaim to be only out of convenience. If love is based only on desire, want, or convenience, then we make the object relative. We define it through us, rather than through them. We deny reality, we deny the other.So, Louis, we're complex. Of course people can feel relieved that things took the course they did; that's different than an intent to kill, and it doesn't mean that an intent to kill should be redefined to whitewash the crime. Great people do terrible things. We all fail. But we should call a failing a failing, and learn from our failures.</comment>

<comment>Taking the claims of anti-abortionism at face value is a failure.</comment>

<comment>The grief and loss of a woman who suffers a miscarriage is real but not at all the same as losing a 5 year old.  The loss in a miscarriage is the loss of the potential human life and all the hopes and dreams the woman has for that potential life. A woman who loses a five year old loses all those hopes and dreams too but also loses an actual child, one that she had cared for, lived with intimately in its earliest days and watched grow.  I know women who have had  miscarriages and sadly also know women who have lost kids. The grieving is not at all in the same ballpark. There is a qualitative difference between a fetus and a child. </comment>

<comment>Nor is the grief of losing a 5 year old the same as losing a teenager, or the same as losing a spouse, or the same as losing a parent. Human beings are not one thing to all people all the time. We are small, we get bigger, we shrink again. To start measuring our worth against one another, and denying the fact that all stages we share a common humanity, is barbarism.</comment>

<comment>"What about teaching people that sex has consequences, and with privilege comes responsibility?"So I feel like you're on the right track, but this is where I think you go wrong. You don't teach about consequences or talk about balancing privilege and responsibility in a life-or-death situation. A child playing in traffic is not an opportunity to lecture her mother on the importance of keeping tabs on her kids. You just pull them out of the street and take them back to their house.It's this moralizing about consequences and responsibility that make pro-choice people think that it's not really about saving the unborn baby, but rather about controlling women. Because usually it is. Most pro-life people I know care about the baby ONLY until its born, at which point the baby and mother are on their own.A progressive pro-life agenda would flip that around. It would support dramatic expansions in sex education and birth control distribution -- Planned Parenthood, without the abortions. It would seek to dramatically increase spending on government-funded pre-natal care, legislate much more extensive parental (especially maternal) leave, expand child tax credits, provide for safe, affordable childcare options, provide for housing and other food, provide training for reentering the workforce and on and on.Yes, that's expensive. But that's the price we pay, as a society and as a government, for presuming to dictate to women what they are allowed to do with their own bodies. I realize that today, most pro-lifers will say the cost is too great and most pro-choicers will say it's not nearly enough. But to me it sounds about right.</comment>

<comment>Pregnancy is a natural act that does not require any artificial intervention to allow pregnancy to reach it ultimate fulfillment. removing body parts for another is an artificial action that interrupts a natural process.</comment>

<comment>The difference is only apparent to those looking for something they can point to and say "HEY, not the same". When you tell a person what they may do with their body, you are telling them that they are irrelevant. Their being, their minds, their soul are nothing of consequence and totally subservient your great designs.If you feel you have the right to tell my daughter what she may do with her body then I have the right to ask you for a kidney or lung.</comment>

<comment>We have all sorts of laws that try to prevent people to use their body. We have laws against stealing, drunk driving et cetera. It is not egregious to prevent people from killing the most helpless humans...the unborn.</comment>

<comment>Stealing, drunk driving etc. all cause injury to others. You fall onto that category by wanting to hurt women.A fetus is not a human.Why do you hate America?</comment>

<comment>What are we taking from the mother and giving to the baby. Can we kill infants because they take the mothers milk?</comment>

<comment>Hey, which one of us stated that "20 week old fetus that can survive outside the womb"? You or me?In vast majority of the cases, this doesn't happen. Therefore, that statement is bogus.</comment>

<comment>I did, and medical science is making it more and more feasible to help these infants survive outside the womb.Listen, I know you think I hate women and fetuses aren't children. But I'm afraid just because there are unappealing people who agree with me doesn't un-do the science. And deep down our own instincts conflict with abortion: women who miscarry, women who put off children during their most fertile years come to find out the rhetoric doesn't match with the reality. It's a painful experience, personally speaking. I once was pro-choice. I understand the dilemma, but unfortunately I also understand consequences now.</comment>

<comment>> I did, and medical science is making it more and more feasible to help these infants survive outside the womb.What's the statistics?> And deep down our own instincts conflict with abortionThe entire human civilization is built on the conflict with our instincts.</comment>

<comment>A fetus of 20 weeks of age can survive outside the mother's womb using modern science. To this point, other developed countries have moved the limit of abortion for any reason to that 20 week limit. After that, it usually only allowed for the typical rape, incest, and danger to mother's life.</comment>

<comment>I'm going to ask you the same question I asked AnnieOfArc - what's the statistics?</comment>

<comment>Statistics of what? And why do you think it matters?</comment>

<comment>The thing is the number of babies that survived after 20 weeks gestation is O. Zero. Nada. None. ...Babies can't survive out side the womb at 20 weeks as they are not developed enough. Even at 24 weeks the baby will only survive with extreme medical intervention and even then, end up with severe health problems.If babies could survive with only 20 weeks gestation, it would be an option. They can't so we don't .</comment>

<comment>So it is ok kill a person based on where they can survive. What horrible logic and a sad view of humanity.</comment>

<comment>I'm still waiting for you to explain why you won't volunteer your uterus to carry a fetus to term instead of continuing with these strawman arguments.</comment>

<comment>Of survivability for a 20 weeks fetus outside of the womb.</comment>

<comment>http://www.easybabylife.com/pr...It's about 20% at 22 weeks. Now why do you think it matters?</comment>

<comment>Now please answer my question. It has nothing to do with 22 weeks, or 21 week. I asked you about 20 weeks.</comment>

<comment>Answer mine.</comment>

<comment>I will. Right after you answer my question. So once again: What are the chances of a 20-week old fetus to survive outside of the womb?</comment>

<comment>A fetus of 20 weeks of age can survive outside the mother's womb using modern science.Can you point to a couple of cases where a 20 /wk fetus survived? Or just one. Surely you can list some hospitals that do this.</comment>

<comment>I may be off by a week. The first link is to a case of earliest born a few years back, I remember reading about a case of 20 weeks a year or so ago, but there's a chance I'm conflating the number with the last link. The second link shows survival rates at different periods. The third link is what I may have conflated some numbers. Ignore the arguments in that, and focus on the point about a lot of other countries (or local jurisdictions) limit elective abortion to before about 20 weeks. The more overarching point here is, we've been moving that needle down as medical science progresses. Will we hit a hard limit? Maybe.http://healthland.time.com/201...http://www.easybabylife.com/pr...http://www.politifact.com/trut...</comment>

<comment>Read your own sources before linking them. And no, I don't read BS advocate sites. http://www.politifact.com/trut...</comment>

<comment>Maybe read my comment before replying then.</comment>

<comment>Your own link, the only one that wasn't biased, pointed out that a fetus is not viable until a minimum of 24 weeks. Even then, over half the fetuses will die. You first said 20 weeks then added one week.You lied and then doubled down on it.</comment>

<comment>It's like you're either retarded or willfully ignorant. That first link I gave was an actual news story about a 21 week old living. It's an actual news event you find it from other sources. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/hea...http://www.theguardian.com/soc...http://www.dailymail.co.uk/hea...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...http://miscarriage.about.com/o...http://www.childhealth-explana...http://www.medscape.com/viewar...And that quoted section you use? From a citation in a ruling from the 70s.Full paragraph from the politifact link."The U.S. requirements for legally obtaining an abortion vary by state, but the national standard was handed down from the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade in 1973. Lawmakers and physicians refer to the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus as "viability." The decision sets the standard that mothers can choose to have an abortion until the point of viability. In citing the leading obstetics publication as a guide, the ruling suggests viability starts at 24 weeks into the gestation period, which starts on the first day of the woman’s last menstrual period."You understand that medical science has advanced in the past 40 years right?</comment>

<comment>One instance does not make it routine. You found ONE instance that happened five years ago. Around four million babies are born in the US every year. Since 2011, 20 million babies have been born in America. One, in 20 million sounds more like super lottery odds.You said 20 weeks and then added a week. This baby was born at almost 22 weeks, not 21.You still can't show us a baby born at 20 weeks gestation. You failed to show us any at 21 weeks.  Posting several links showing something else won't change the fact you can't back up your claims.BUT, you called me retarded and willfully ignorant. Look moron, I'm not the one inventing facts.***Phineas Gage had a metal rod go through his head. He lived. That does not mean that if you have a rod go though your head you can expect to survive. Now YOU might, but ordinary people wouldn't. (http://www.roadsideamerica.com...</comment>

<comment>Dear lord dude. Go reread my comments, you're unhinged in some fashion. Yes, you're retarded and willfully ignorant. Your argument boils down to at this point number fudging. Something I made note of a few comments back.I'm done here, it's obvious you have nothing to add as you know nothing.</comment>

<comment>So you gave up when you realized that you were caught lying. You should have done that several posts ago.</comment>

<comment>No when I realized I'm talking to a brick wall.</comment>

<comment>medical science is making it more and more feasible to help these infants survive outside the womb.Ask any physician and they will tell you that they do not want premature babies. They don't want to start IVs in veins the size of hair. They don't want to be there when the preemie dies. So no, a 23 week old fetus is not viable.We don't care what your personal history is. Just stop making decisions that bind my wife, daughter, nieces, and every other woman I know.</comment>

<comment>Then how about you teach them that actions have consequences, and holding innocent life emotionally hostage to your failure to do so is wrong.</comment>

<comment>Stop holding women hostage to your demand that they bear children they do not want.</comment>

<comment>Stop putting people in prison just because they terminated a life that they did not want to live.</comment>

<comment>And once again, you are hitting POST before you thought about what you wrote.The good news is that Obamacare does cover mental illness treatments. The bad news is you are wasting that option.</comment>

<comment>If we repeal all laws, then all of us will not be bound by laws that force decisions upon us.</comment>

<comment>Apparently you hit POST before you thought that one through.</comment>

<comment>Every child should be a wanted child,born because the mother wanted it.Any law that takes away her right to decide not to complete a pregnancy declares her will to bear that child to be of no value.</comment>

<comment>Location had nothing to do with the right of a human organism to life.</comment>

<comment>Are you sure you're answering the right person?</comment>

<comment>Funny how the fetal incubators (pregnant women) always seem to be conspicuously -and conveniently- absent from such rhetoric.</comment>

<comment>Sure, reduce the creation of life, the care for the weakest and the co-dependence each of us relies on to make sense of this world to a consumerist grab of "rights" over responsibilities. That argument has a kind of cold, sterile, nihilistic logic, but it ignores the sacrifices, the burdens, and the complexity which actually exist in the real world. It also ignores that most women who procure abortions feel like they didn't have a choice at all. Keep telling yourself that we hate women, when we want to give them options.</comment>

<comment>Sure, reduce the creation of life,Sorry dear, but that "creation of life" happened a couple of billion years ago and has been one continuous chain. There is no new life when a fetus is conceived; it is just that same continuation of life. If either the egg or the sperm is dead then there is no continuation of the life and no fetus.</comment>

<comment>Please do not call me 'dear'. You don't know me, and the intent is to patronize me. But if you want to shoot yourself in the foot and look like a condescending sexist, go right ahead.As for the rest of your argument, well, it's not really an argument at all. It's a big jell-o mush. The last two sentences do not go together whatsoever; they're not scientific or even anti-scientific, they're just bizarre.</comment>

<comment>Their comment wasn't hard to follow, and was a valid statement.</comment>

<comment>You haven't responded to any of my points and are dead-set on pursuing me to troll and insult. When someone uses a definition of life so broad as to deny the separation between individual life forms, it's jello.It's true in the very broadest of senses, in that plants and eggs and sperm and monkeys are all part of a fabric of life. It's nonsense in that we do not experience life as one seamless continuation, but with clear boundaries between beings, clear beginnings and endings. An egg by itself does not grow into a person. A sperm by itself does not produce more life. Alone, they are dead ends. Together, a new life form emerges.This kind of "a rat is a pig is a dog is a boy" thinking is as anti-science as it gets.</comment>

<comment>You obviously don't understand science well-enough to employ it as the basis of a rhetorical argument.</comment>

<comment>But both the egg and sperm are alive, and human.  So life begins way before conception. </comment>

<comment>What a terrible, bad-will argument. We all know life comes from life. But you are a unique being. You are not your mother, or your father. You came into existence when parts of them came together. Individual life and communal life are different things. Follow your thinking and it doesn't really matter if anyone lives or dies b/c we're all each other, man. But the uniqueness matters a heck of a lot to the individuals concerned.</comment>

<comment> You came into existence when parts of them came together.Nope. An egg is fertilized, or conceived, and then that conception develops into a human. There is no divine touch or new life created. What is there is just a continuation of what has lived for millions of years, although some will says billions.Edited first sentence to be more clear.</comment>

<comment>So when is that magical moment a human being comes into existence, mmm? Oh, oops, you said it yourself before you went back to edit it away: a person is conceived. According to the universal science, whether it's two horses, two pandas, two bugs: a unique life begins at conception. And as you pointed out: a unique Person.Interesting phrasing, and interesting that you felt the need to edit.</comment>

<comment>There IS NO MAGICAL MOMENT,however desperately you wish there was...there is a gradual process that birth completes.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a great argument against abortion to me1</comment>

<comment>It would. But then that would be an indicator of your views on enslaving women too.</comment>

<comment>Our lives continue the lives of all our biological ancestors.We become individuals distinct from our mothers through the process of gestation,not instantaneously at conception when we are less independent of them than their intestinal flora.</comment>

<comment>Giving them options by removing their choices? Interesting.</comment>

<comment>What about most women saying they felt like they had no choice and doing it for economic reasons don't you understand? Abortion is the prime example of a throw-away, capitalist society, reducing life to something to be bought, sex and people things to be consumed, teaches people to live without consequences, and lets men to use women without responsibility.</comment>

<comment>What looks like logic to you looks like a pretzel to those who understand logic.</comment>

<comment>Okay, so that was just an emotional refusal to debate, but insult instead. We won't get anywhere. Too bad, but best wishes all the same.</comment>

<comment>You see insults everywhere, apparently.And what you think is "logic" is illogical and hilariously convoluted. Better?</comment>

<comment>Your opinion, duly noted.</comment>

<comment>Idiots like you who advocate slavery should be insulted. garbage and should be treated as such</comment>

<comment>I don't advocate slavery, and your name-calling is a juvenile way to handle a difficult topics. Immature mud-slinging seems to be the fruit of your beliefs; says a lot about your beliefs. And, your inability to distinguish b/t wholly different but barbaric crimes. (Also, it was 'garbage' people like me who advocated against slavery, and were called garbage, and it's 'garbage' people like me who continue to rail against modern slavery. Before you accuse others of advocating slavery, check your slavery footprint, and make sure you're typing on an ethical smartphone oh wait there aren't any.)</comment>

<comment>You most definitely do advocate slavery.   What do your think forcing women to carry unwanted pregnancies is? You plan to just convince them all with your lame arguments? You are disgusting and a liar.</comment>

<comment>No I don't. And you know it. And you can't even have a conversation about the real things that can be done to accommodate both sides. You just want a free-for-all and to demonize the other side.And, worst of all? I was convinced by the arguments I'm making, and I've already convinced others since I switched. I was massively pro-choice. For decades. I know the ins-and-outs of the pretzel-twisting. I've seen the consequences of your thinking. And while I'm open to exceptions and tolerance, attitudes like yours will continue to repel people who are capable of shades of grey. Good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>Those of us who know better than to be convinced by the specious arguments you are making will continue to fight for the righteous side you have abandoned until the harmful side you have joined has given up.</comment>

<comment>A lying liar lies.  You've always been a moron forced birth terrorist. You always will be.  And you have convinced no one.  The majority of the country thinks abortion should be legal until viability and when medically necessary after that.  The percentage of people who feel this way are not changing (the topic of the article).It's sad you think you're incoherent blathering could possibly sway anyone, ever. However, I'm not surprised a brainless twit like you would be so delusionalAgain, I will not treat lowlifes like you in a civilized manner because you want to enslave women, and treat them like incubators.  You loathsome and deserve only scorn</comment>

<comment>Aww, you're sweet. Nice little reality you've created for yourself there. And neat name-calling; really convincing (as opposed to actual arguments) I'll leave you to it! :)</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure why you're being condescending?  I haven't seen you make a single legitimate point here as you repeatedly claim </comment>

<comment>I'm being condescending to someone who has ignored my arguments and resorted to saying I'm loathsome, a lowlife, and advocating slavery. That's what the overall tone of this thread has been, and I've been tiresome (yes, me) to keep responding to accusations. But my points were in many other comment threads, many with people who disagreed with me, but were able to keep it polite and interesting.Having my experiences which led me to more reverence for life be reduced to "lowlife" and equivalent to advocating for "slavery" is intensely frustrating.</comment>

<comment>She's being condescending because the poster was incredibly insulting and resorting to personal attacks.</comment>

<comment>Ah so you're an idiot too.  Got it </comment>

<comment>Exhibit A.</comment>

<comment>Well I guess all i have is a ton of polling data on my side (as mentioned in the article). But hey, you have the power of stupid, soo... </comment>

<comment>Fine and we see you as a low life deserving of scorn and a loathsome human being, so we both have our opinions of the other.</comment>

<comment>Well the law is on my side. so you pro slavery terrorists ar just going to have to live with not being able to force you repulsive ideas on anyone.  </comment>

<comment>But the law can change. It changes in terms of doing away with human slavery. By your logic, when the Dred Scott decison was handed down, that shoiuld have been it. Slaveyr was clegal and the country should have just learned to tlive with it, or the Plese decision when it was handed down that said separate but equal was constitutional. We should just have learned to live with that, correct? No attempt should have been made to change these laws by your logic.</comment>

<comment>Well slavery is clearly wrong, as is returning to the travesty that caused so many unwanted pregnancies to be brought to term, and forced women into dangerous back allay abortions.  As this article points out, the majority of people in this country agree with the law the way it is.  The percentage of people for and against has remained stable for decades.  You cannot change the law when most disagree with you </comment>

<comment>So then, since 90% of the people of El Salvador agree that abortion should remain a serious criminal act in that country you are OK with abortion remaining a criminal act in that country because it has 90% of that society's support. So. based on how the law defines slavery, do you still insist that to make abortion illegal fits  the legal definition of slavery?</comment>

<comment>PS. Slavery of a human being means the the person is treated as a piece of property. can you show me where in the law women have been declared property ?</comment>

<comment>Once a law forces you to do something you do not want to do, by your logic, that is slavery.</comment>

<comment>No.  But forcing women against their we to carry unwanted pregnancies to is slavery.  I'm glad you creeps will never get your way. </comment>

<comment>Slavery in its actual legal form means that a human entity is regarded as property to  be bought and sold and subject to the whims of its the owner, and is without ANY legal rights. Please show me where in the law women have been placed in that status.</comment>

<comment>Interesting, I was just thinking the same about your arguments from my perspective of having a law degree since 1982 and using it.</comment>

<comment>Cool, I'm an astronaut!</comment>

<comment>Old man.  Thankfully you'll be gone soon, and the world ride of your ignorance </comment>

<comment>Except that my two sons and my brothers 5 children all hold the same view as me.</comment>

<comment>The anti-choice crowd tend to think that "personal responsibility" starts and ends with others. Abortion may seem like a throw away life style and even if it is, so what? What gives you the right to decide how someone may treat their body?If you don't want an abortion then don't have one. If you feel strongly that every fetus deserves to live, then volunteer your womb and carry one to term. Just stop trying to force your morality on others.</comment>

<comment>What gives and takes and defines rights is each particular society and in the end the police power to enforce the societal will.  Thus we do have laws that limit how someone may treat their own body. we do not allow a person to sell the use of their body for sex, to sell body parts for profit. Suppose I I want to sell my hand to someone for money just because they want to possess it and maybe have it bronzed and displayed? By your logic I should be able to do so. My body, my choice, right?I</comment>

<comment>Your logic skills need some honing. You might want to look up "strawman argument". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...see also http://www.logicallyfallacious...and (the Nizkor Project is a favorite of mine)http://www.nizkor.org/features...</comment>

<comment>I enjoy how Mr. Fusion defined the strawman argument but didn't define how your argument was one. The reality that ideas have logical consequences isn't being taught in college these days, apparently.</comment>

<comment>Unfotunately, banning abortion would not lead to more respect for women, as that is a cultural issue that is not well connected to abortion. Life has never been very precious in all of recorded history, rather, only some lives are precious.  This country tolerates huge amounts of senseless death, and banning abortion won't change that either.  What banning abortion will do is lead to the births of many more unwanted children, which will have huge societal costs. </comment>

<comment>"most women who procure abortions feel like they didn't have a choice at all."I didn't realize you are most women.  </comment>

<comment>My goodness, all you men on here are so deliberately bratty. Yes, surveys of post-abortive women consistently say the reason most of them chose abortion was because they felt they didn't have a choice. We don't do it for fun; we're led into a consumerist, capitalist culture which consumes human beings, telling them to treat each other as objects. And when women are suddenly reminded that actions have consequences, they feel put upon by a society which values Success above all else. And the lack of support they feel leads them to murder their own offspring.</comment>

<comment>I definitely feel what you're saying in regard to consumer capitalist culture. What I don't see is how this leads to: "therefore the State should outlaw abortion". These women you're referring to may have felt like they had no choice, but... actually, legally, they did (no thanks to the pro-life movement). How does removing the option to have an abortion without removing the economic/cultural circumstances that made them believe it was an imperative actually help them?</comment>

<comment>Thank you for the polite response. Honestly? I'm not sure the State should outlaw all abortions. But I'm really frustrated that we've moved from safe, legal, and rare to #shoutyourabortion. I was pro-choice for 30 years, and I was exhausted, hurt, and damaged by the sex-without-consequences culture. What I want most of all is to support women (and men) in starting families, and help people treat one another as worthy of our love and respect, rather than disposable.I come across as anti-choice because I feel that the realities of what abortion means are being denied or white-washed. Choice matters, but what that choice really means should not be papered over.</comment>

<comment>Only if we agree that rights begin at birth is it possible to guarantee them equally to all.</comment>

<comment>Why pick such an arbitrary point in human development to confer rights.  Why not follow such positions as that of Peter Singer? He  is the Ira W. DeCamp Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University, and a Laureate Professor at the Centre for Applied Philosophy and Public Ethics at the University of Melbourne. Singer holds that the right to life is essentially tied to a being's capacity to hold preferences, which in turn is essentially tied to a being's capacity to feel pain and pleasure.In Practical Ethics, Singer argues in favour of abortion on the grounds that fetuses are neither rational nor self-aware, and can therefore hold no preferences. As a result, he argues that the preference of a mother to have an abortion automatically takes precedence. In sum, Singer argues that a fetus lacks personhood.Similar to his argument for abortion, Singer argues that newborns lack the essential characteristics of personhood—"rationality, autonomy, and self-consciousness" and therefore "killing a newborn baby is never equivalent to killing a person, that is, a being who wants to go on living.That seems a lot more rational argument that just picking your arbitrary point.</comment>

<comment>There is no more logical point.Until then whatever rights attributed are necessarily rights taken from what ought to be an indisputable person.Singer is a madman and a traitor to the species.Eduard Verhagen and his "Groningen Protocol" also defend killing newborns...but it is the anti-abortionists with their outrageous overestimation of the importance of conception who open the door to monstrous underestimates of the importance of birth.</comment>

<comment>That is just your opinion, at least singer's position is based on a logic.</comment>

<comment>He ignores vital distinctions in the quest for false conclusions.</comment>

<comment>What distinctions?</comment>

<comment>The core traits of what constitutes an indisputable  person are present at conception. Besides I guess  singer is disputing your concept of what you claim is indisputable, so with both Singer and my self disputing you assertion, it is thus not indisputable.</comment>

<comment>You confuse potential with its realization.At conception,the life is not distinct,only capable of eventually becoming distinct.Irrational disputation is simply madness.</comment>

<comment>That is the most irrational argument put forth, there is no such thing as a potential human being, all of science recognizes that a human being exists at conception and just goes through different stages of development. At conception it is distinct because it meets the definition of what constitutes a distinct individual which is:  1) The new organism is alive rather than dead or inanimate; 2) It is human rather than the member of some other species; 3) It is not a functional part of a larger organism (like a kidney is a part of a larger organism; 4)It maintains its own organic unity over time; 5) It directs its own genetic template from conception to natural death. I challenge you to read the article I am linking you and challenge you to find any factual error in it.  https://www.princeton.edu/~pro...</comment>

<comment>The irrationality here is the conceit that "a human being exists at conception",when honest reading of the science must conclude that the premise that there is any instantaneous moment at which a human being goes from zero to completely individuated has been comprehensively falsified by the nature of the developmental process.The uniting of the live human sperm and live human ovum makes them no more alive or more human.The complete organic dependence of the zygote on its environment makes its life less independent of the woman's than are those of her intestinal flora,as is its ability to maintain its organic unity over time.The article you link is a polemic that treats the dubious as preemptively proven.</comment>

<comment>The nature of the process is what supports it. All biology has agreed on the fact that uniting of egg and sperm if the start of a totally new individual that is as completely developed as a fully developed human being is for its stage of development. Now how about addressing why the criteria I set forth is flawed? And do you really mean that after fertilization, the organism does not meet the criteria of being alive?</comment>

<comment>Only misinterpretation of biology "agrees" with your absurd statement.At that stage of development individuation at the life level has yet to be achieved.Being alive and being a life,distinct from the other,are different things.</comment>

<comment>Now there are quotes out of biology/embryology books written by the experts in the field“It is the penetration of the ovum by a sperm and the resulting mingling of nuclear material each brings to the union that constitutes the initiation of the life of a new individual.” Clark Edward and  Corliss Patten’s Human Embryology, McGraw – Hill Inc., 30“Reproduction depends on the union of male and female gametes (reproductive, or germ, cells) each with a half set of chromosomes, to form a new individual with a full, unique set of chromosomes.”Human Physiology: From Cells to Systems 2nd Cd Ed,Sherwood, Kell & Ward, 2013, 2010, Nelson Education Ltd. 709“Zygote. This cell results from the union of an oocyte and a sperm during fertilization. A zygote is the beginning of a new human being(i.e., an embryo).” … “[The zygote] marked the beginning of each of us as a unique individual.”  Keith L. Moore and T.V.N. Persaud, The Developing Human: Clinically Oriented Embryology, 7th ed., Philadelphia: Saunders, 2003, pp. 2,16“Fertilization is the process by which male and female haploid gametes (sperm and egg) unite to produce a genetically distinct individual.”Signorelli et al., Kinases, phosphatases and proteases during sperm capacitation, CELL TISSUE RES. 349(3):765 (Mar. 20, 2012)So please present your credentials that refutes these experts in their field that individuation does in fact exist upon union of sperm and egg.</comment>

<comment>Theory and practice!...the formation of the combined genetic code does not translate into its already being capable of perpetuation in the absence of the life of the surrounding woman.</comment>

<comment>So what is the relevance of your statement? science has still proven it to be that which you deny, and individual living human being from fertilization forward, something you denied.  All that the embryologists state is fact, not theory.  I am still awaiting any scientific evidence  by embryologists that refute those I have posted to you since you have disagreed with them.</comment>

<comment>Only in your mind has science "proven" what you want to believe.You draw the inferences you want but they are not supported or not relevant to the issue of when personhood deserves recognition.</comment>

<comment>I have cited to you several authoritative sceitific sources for proof that science had declared that an individual not a potential individual, but a real individual exists from the moment of conception, now insted of just offering prsonal opinion, please provide authroitative sources that disprove what I have proferred. I am asking again for the third time.  If science declares that a unique individual exists from the moment of conception, why should that not be the acceptable point for conferring personhood?</comment>

<comment>Science can ONLY speak to potential in these specific circumstances,not wave a magic wand and declare the potential already realized.Science DOES NOT declare that the subordination of the embryonic life to the woman's life that is absolutely manifest in the observed circumstances does not exist.Birth is the only acceptable point for conferring personhood.</comment>

<comment>No science doe not declare potential. it has repeated declared that there is no such thing as a potential human being, it has declared that a human being, a new individual, not a potential individual exists from birth. I again ask you to cite like I did to authoritative proof to support your position. All you do is provide personal opinion.  I agree that it is up to society to accept what science has put before it in order to use the evidence to come the logical  conclusion that fertilization is the  logical point to define and give the protection of personhood instead of  picking arbitrary points as you and other do. Now please provide extrinsic proof other than ofeering your opinion to prove your point.</comment>

<comment>No,the non-scientific observer makes the inferences you declare.Honest observation acknowledges that potential is all that there is to see at that stage.You are offering opinion no less than I am.There is absolutely no logical basis to overestimate the importance of fertilization the way you do.</comment>

<comment>You're twisted </comment>

<comment>How am I twisted, in court, we would call that a conclusion. You have to present facts to support your conclusion. Also we would have to have a definition of "twisted" So please first put forth your definition of what defines "twisted" and then put forth the evidence that i fit into that definition. please cite to law and court precedent to support your allegations</comment>

<comment>"Choice matters, but what that choice really means..."How about this?"Choice matters, but what that choice really means TO ME..."FTFY.What choice means changes from person to person. To you, the choice to have an abortion means ending a life. Fine.To me, the choice to have an abortion means preventing a possible life.Huge difference. There is no "absolute, correct, meaning" that you get to define according to your own morality for everyone else.I decide for me. You decide for you. You will NEVER decide for me unless this country becomes a fascist, totalitarian state.How about that?</comment>

<comment>We already decide for you in this country. Our society has decided you can sell the use of your body for sex. You society has decided that you cannot sell your bod parts for money, so we are already deciding for you.</comment>

<comment>How about this? You want to discuss exceptions in cases of rape, incest? Fine.But if you want to decide to engage in an action with a known consequence then, like anyone else, you take responsibility.Because there is no right to bloody kill, and you already live in a country where some people have engaged in an Orwellian and totalitarian war against other human beings. Like Carthage before you, the memory of your human sacrifices will remain in historical infamy.</comment>

<comment>I would also like to say that you are heavily projecting your own negative experiences with sex and pregnancy onto other women and attempting to present your reality as all realities. Guess what, not all people have lived as slovenly as you have. Doesn't mean you get to come around when you're all rode out and dictate to other people.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha, oh man, that was good. Slovenly? Negative experiences? Oh, for your sake, I wish you knew me; but I don't think I'd find you too interesting. It's fascinating that you need to project such Victorian attributes onto me. I've watched a lot of women go through a lot of pain after abortions; suicide attempts, heavy alcoholism. That doesn't mean -I- went through them. And while I've dated one or two guys who weren't total princes doesn't mean you need to slut-shame me; what it means is I was capable on drawing lessons from the experience.Most of the commenters dedicated to hurling insults on here are men. Not a coincidence: abortion has been a give-away to men. How sad to see women lining up behind them, defending men's rights to walk away from women they've used, as these women cut up and vacuum out their own children.</comment>

<comment>And I find little shame in directing a "slut-shaming" comment towards someone who believes women should give up bodily autonomy for nine months because you are a whiner. That's really fucking rich. I love it.</comment>

<comment>You are completely wrong about your survey facts. Recent surveys have stated that 95% of women felt relief upon having an abortion along with the fact that they do not feel lingering negative emotions in relation to it. You are LYING. You can go to the Guttmacher thinktank and read all about how you are wrong.</comment>

<comment>Guttmachter is not a neutral third party. "Recent surveys" is vague and meaningless. Abortion is not a one-off event: why do so many women go on to regret their decision decades later? I am not lying, but if it makes you feel better to put it in all capitals sure, pretend that's an argument.</comment>

<comment>As far as I can tell you have supplied zero empirical studies, zero scholarly articles, zero reputable sources, and have supplied anecdotal evidence which is the definition of *unfounded and unreliable*.  Recent surveys? I didn't realize that I need to provide you with a source and MLA citation, but hey, here you go. http://www.reuters.com/article...That study came out late in 2015 from Univ. of California School of Medicine. The answer to your question of why women regret it later is that they don't. You have made that up. You are lying. You are making broad general statements that are opinion and are presenting them as facts. I do feel better about capitals, they make me smile :).</comment>

<comment>Of course I didn't, this is the Atlantic comment thread. I'm commenting casually, not writing a paper. You brought up the Guttmacher Institute, I said they were biased. I've been on both sides of the issue, and frankly I didn't find those studies convincing then and I don't now. Overall, I was swayed by anecdote and evidence. But, for your sake, there's a number of studies listed here at the bottom: http://www.colorado.edu/studen...And as for the 95% feel grateful right away... I wonder how many criminals feel grateful when they get away with something too. Feeling "relief" doesn't make an act morally right. Someone committing a crime of passion also might be glad they did it. Someone committing a hate crime might be glad they did it. It doesn't make the deed right.And sometimes, down the road, the criminal who did something feels regret.I'm not swayed by your line of argument, b/c our entire culture is heavily invested in a consumerist way of living, treating people as commodities. The major power centers of our culture line up to support it as they have supported blatant evils in the past, and as they do so with other current evils (see: our economic supply-chains). So it was in Carthage. So it was with the Aztec elites. So it was with the slave-owners of the American South. Crimes were still being committed. It took John Newton a long time to realize what he was doing; he lived surrounded by people rationalizing away the guilt. Still, the scales fell from his eyes. May the same gift be given to you.As it is, you think (or *know*) that I hate women. I know that's not true, but we don't know each other (and of course I'm sure the notion appalls you). I doubt more vitriol will leave either of us more optimistic about humanity or will brighten our respective days, so I, for my part, suggest we move on to more fruitful endeavors. Regardless of your feelings to my position, I wish you well. Good day.</comment>

<comment>Umm.......maam. Please. The source dates for that page are as follows: 1980,1977, 1978,1971, 1981, 1977, 1987, 1987,1972, aaaand 1977.  Roe. V. Wade was in 1973. Didn't your professors tell you to use relevant and recent empirical studies? Also that is from a student group. Mine was from a medical study. I'll let myself out, this must be embarrassing for you.</comment>

<comment>What gives you any right to decide what my wife or daughter may do with their body? What they do is none of your business.</comment>

<comment>When another human being is involved? It is everyone's business. We have laws against murder for a reason: it concerns us all. You may disagree whether or not it's a person, but the idea that how life comes into the world isn't anyone's business is nonsense. Nice trolling.</comment>

<comment>The idea that an embryo is already "another human being" is nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Why?</comment>

<comment>Because it tries to pretend that once the lengthy process of individuation has started,it should be treated as already completed.</comment>

<comment>It is actually never completed. We are always developing as we age, so actually there is no such thing as a completed person, so to pick any point in the timeline from conception to natural death as a point which allows for the termination of a continually developing person is totally arbitrary.</comment>

<comment>The mores and values that society want to codify into law is what decides, thus your wife or daughter and you cannot sell the use of your bodies for sex. The laws prohibit you  from say cutting off your hand and selling it to another person from money just because you desire to sell it and they desire to buy it.</comment>

<comment>So you hold up a law that prohibits the selling of body parts as a reason to deny a woman from controlling her body? Seriously dude? Again, you didn't think before making that argument.It is perfectly legal in this country to cut off your hand. Many might question your mental state, but it is still legal. What is illegal is you may not sell a body part for profit. You are perfectly within your rights to recoup your costs, but not for a profit.Your point really is that while we do not control what you may do with your quite live and useful hand, you do not want to extend that to a woman carrying a fetus. You may cut off your hand for whatever reason that comes to your mind,but you don't want someone else to have that same right when it comes to what is in their womb. You may not want that tumor, or gall bladder, or appendix, or whatever in your body and that is your right. Yet, you still reserve the right to deny others that same choice.And you don't see the hypocrisy in your argument.</comment>

<comment>No,you want to replace their options.</comment>

<comment>An unborn fetus is a fully developed human for its stage of human development, just as a baby is for its stage, a toddler for its stage, an adolescent for its stage. I put forth to you that by your logic, a fully developed human being is one who has the actual ability, not just the potential, to procreate, so shall we allow for the termination of all humans before that stage of development?</comment>

<comment>An unborn fetus is not a human yet. Just like a single fertilized cell is not a human.</comment>

<comment>They are equal. They are absolutely equal. Just as a just-born infant, incapable of supporting herself in any way whatsoever, is absolutely equal to a fully grown man. Human life is human life, at all stages of development, regardless of age, capacity, capability, color, class, or disability.</comment>

<comment>Of course they aren't. Just-born infant, for instance, cannot vote.From this perspective - do you support complete ban on abortions, including the cases of rape, detrimental situations to mother's health and incest?</comment>

<comment>Your response indicates that you have no understanding on what true human dignity and equality is. You base equality on capabilities, when human dignity is based purely on the fact of our humanness. For example, you would then say that a felon is unequal to someone who has never committed a crime, because the felon can't vote. Or that woman before 1920 were unequal to men.Of course I support a complete ban on abortion, except in those thankfully rare cases when during labor it becomes clear that both mother and child would die if labor continued. The commitment to life does not end because the circumstances of its beginning are not ideal. There is no greater good in compounding the evil of rape or incest with the further evil of murder and denying that child's right to live based only its origins.That being said, I'm also a pragmatist, and know that we must fight for what is realistic, which is why I would absolutely vote for a ban with those exceptions.</comment>

<comment>So a raped woman is to carry the offspring of her rapist inside herself for 9 months. Gotcha.> For example, you would then say that a felon is unequal to someone who has never committed a crime, because the felon can't vote.You provide me an example of inequality. Something that makes people... not equal.</comment>

<comment>So you were not a fetus once. Fetus, Latin for little one, develop into adults as do infants, as do teenagers.</comment>

<comment>What I was is irrelevant here. Already-born children have less rights then adults.</comment>

<comment>By the same logic a nut fallen from the tree and then eaten should be treated the same as a cut-down tree."Innocent" doesn't apply to embryos.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I think you missed the mark on that one. But if a tumor starts talking to me, I might have to reconsider taking its life. </comment>

<comment>I'm curious now - just how many talking newborns have you met?</comment>

<comment>How many fetuses have you invited over to your house lately?</comment>

<comment>How many one month olds have invited you to their house?.</comment>

<comment>My grandson for one. But now that he is three months, you may have a point.I do assume you meant "my" house, as I am unaware of any one month old owning a house. Nor would I invite someone to their house.</comment>

<comment>Well since no fetus, ever, in the history of the fucking world, has ever talked, then I guess you and registered_with_disqus are in agreement.</comment>

<comment>THE CRAP OF YOUR EXAMPLE IS PLAIN TO DEBUNK---THE CYST CANNOT SURVIVE ON ITS OWN--KEEP YOUR CRAP !</comment>

<comment>Nor can a fetus when its aborted.</comment>

<comment>So then abortion should be OK until the fetus is developed enough to live without the mother...got it.</comment>

<comment>THATS OUTRIGHT STUPID--SINCE IT WILL BE ABLE TO MOST ALL TIMES AND YET THE CYST NEVER WOULD-- SUCH CRAP LOGIC COMES FROM PROGRESSIVES--- THE REAL QUESTION NEEDING ASKED-- IS IT VIABLE ? FOR THE PARAMETER TO DECIDE--</comment>

<comment>ADD TO THAT PROVE A CYST EVER BECAME A PERSON--AND IF YOU CANNOT SEE THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT FACT THERE IS NO HELPING YOU--</comment>

<comment>Wow those posts come across as very crazy.You sure you did not forget a "BENGHAZIIII !!!!11!1!!" or a "WAAAAKE UP SHEEEEPLE !!" somewhere in there ?</comment>

<comment>YOU'RE THE ONE MAKING THE CRAP CLAIMS SUCH AS CYSTS ARE ALIVE AS A PERSON WHICH IS THE ONLY WAY YOUR IDEA WOULD HAVE MERIT! AS FAR AS THE OTHER IS CONCERNED THEN IF TRUE WHY NOT?NO WORSE THAN YOUR CRAP!!</comment>

<comment>Gibberish, all gibberish.</comment>

<comment>Cysts are no less alive than embryos,and no less superfluous to the person of whose life theirs is a part than embryos.</comment>

<comment>YOU ARE FULL OF CRAP--A CYST CAN NEVER BE A PERSON---ONLY THE MOST ILLOGICAL OF MORONS WOULD MAKE THIS CRAP COMPARISON--WERE WHAT YOU SAID BE TRUE THEN WHERES THE CYST'S PERSON? AND CAN IT PROCREATE ? MAKE NEW LITTLE ONES OF IT THAT CAN SURVIVE AFTER REACHING MATURITY?YOU NEED TO READ THE DEFINITION OF WHAT LIFE IS---</comment>

<comment>A cyst is also genetically identical to the person it's on, unlike a fetus. Frankly, your comparing of a baby to a cyst is disgusting.</comment>

<comment>You know what's disgusting? Your sneaky attempt to replace the terminology. Fetus is not a baby.</comment>

<comment>lol, that's hilarious. Go walk up to a pregnant woman and ask her how her fetus is doing. At best she'll give you a funny look. But that sophistry aside, the dictionary just doesn't agree with you.baby - a (1)  :  an extremely young child; especially   :  infant  (2)  :  an extremely young animal b  :  the youngest of a groupfetus - an unborn or unhatched vertebrate especially after attaining the basic structural plan of its kind; specifically   :  a developing human from usually two months after conception to birthThe two aren't mutually exclusive terms.Either way, you're objection to my word usage doesn't change the point. A fetus is still genetically unique while a cyst is not. And you have not adequately countered this point.</comment>

<comment>The Dictionary? Really? lol...</comment>

<comment>I know right, it's like the easiest place to check what terms mean.</comment>

<comment>And totally irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>It would be if someone hadn't whined about my word usage as incorrect; instead of actually addressing my point.</comment>

<comment>No, it's still totally irrelevant. Maybe you can figure out why by yourself.</comment>

<comment>For someone who thinks that a human can give birth to a dog, I don't think you can give much advice on figuring things out.</comment>

<comment>So no, you can't figure it out by yourself.Thank God religion is waning fast (as information becomes more accessible, interestingly enough). It's been a scourge that the human race has had to endure for far too long.</comment>

<comment>I haven't used religion to argue my point, which again just points out that your presumptions make you look stupid.</comment>

<comment>Only because you have no point. Just a lot of emotional blathering </comment>

<comment>The irony of your comment is astonishing.</comment>

<comment>You appear ignorant on the definition of irony. Not surprising since you're ignorant on everything else you yammer about. </comment>

<comment>You give me 2 different definitions, and claim they are... the same? Seriously - how is your reading comprehension?Also, I fail to see what being genetically unique has to do with this.</comment>

<comment>I never said they were the same, I said they weren't mutually exclusive. So the real question, is how is yours?Genetic uniqueness doesn't have to do with this. I has to do with the original comment you made, and was my original point in opposition to your poor cyst analogy.</comment>

<comment>Sun - a main star of our solar system.Moon - main natural satellite of our planet.While they are not mutually exclusive, they don't have much in common.</comment>

<comment>Sun and moon are mutually exclusive. I'm really done with this semantics piss contest. It's a digression.</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot.  That definition totally disagrees with your ignorant beliefs </comment>

<comment>Oh enlightenment me most dictatorial one!</comment>

<comment>Good one, Dear Leader. But I'm not the one trying to tell others what to do with their bodies </comment>

<comment>Glad to know you can only offer emotional rhetoric as an argument. But hey, if it helps, by your argument I guess you're okay if I stabbed you a few times. Since you know, you don't like telling others what to do with their bodies.</comment>

<comment>I believe that would be assault as my body is not your body.  I guess I shouldn't be surprised that your too dumb to tell the difference. Thankfully, you pro slavery forced birth jihadists are to stupid, useless and poor to live anywhere near my quiet little beach community. </comment>

<comment>Ohhh so maybe you're getting it now? You can reasonably tell people what they can and can't do with their body.</comment>

<comment>I get the feeling I'm talking to a failed abortion. They scrambled your brain but then decided to let you live.  I find that sad.  They should have put you out of your misery </comment>

<comment>Of course they are mutually exclusive. A fetus can't be a fetus once it's out of the womb and a baby is a young infant. And you can review all the definition you want and the etymology of the word but they all agree that an baby and an infant can't be unborn.Except for the emotional attachment that a mother feel for her fetus that will make her call her fetus a baby no one in any medical profession, or pretty much anyone outside of the future parents and relatives, will call a fetus a baby.And we usually don't correct the future parent for incorrectly calling their fetus a baby because we're not assholes who tell other what to do with their body.</comment>

<comment>Find me a definition that says a baby must be born first to be a baby. Until then, you haven't argued that the two terms are not mutually exclusive. Do you see the word born or unborn in the definition I put above? No? Well I guess the claim that "they all agree..." is false.</comment>

<comment>The forced birth jihadists always attempt to conflate the two </comment>

<comment>What is the difference between a baby and a cyst?Hint; a baby lives outside the womb.</comment>

<comment>The word baby is not defined by where it lives. It is defined by its age, particularly relative to other age groups. A baby is merely the youngest age of a group e.g. animal. Heavily tied to the synonym infant, which is a child in the first period of life.</comment>

<comment>Either way, both babies and infants are born.</comment>

<comment>Nope, no reliance on birth, but on life. Any biologist will tell you a baby is alive before they are born. There's nothing magical about being squeezed out of a uterus that suddenly makes something living.</comment>

<comment>Funny thing about early-stage development, until it's fairly far along (well-past embryo stage) you could not tell the difference between a human embryo and that of a dog, fish, horse, or many if not most other vertebrates.So merely being "alive" is hardly a useful metric. Besides, my blood cells are alive, and some day we will probably be able to clone a complete human from a sample of their DNA (that didn't come from stem cells, which we can already grow out into a clone though no one has tried it -or admitted trying it- with a human yet).</comment>

<comment>I'm going to assume at this point you're not willing to engage in an earnest discussion. As your first paragraph would heavily imply that you think a human woman could give birth to a dog, fish, or horse. That simple reasoning aside, they can look at the genes of an embryo, and yes you can tell whether the embryo is human or not.Your second point is wrong for the same reason the argument above involving a cyst is wrong.</comment>

<comment>There's no "discussion" here to engage in, though. You're preaching your gospel and your mind is made up. I support letting women make up their own minds.Don't like abortion? Don't have one.</comment>

<comment>More than one life is under consideration. The relativism of the "Don't have one" argument is perilous to us all. You're not an island.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm a peninsula. Or whatever.Anyway, the woman who is pregnant is the only one whose choice is relevant.</comment>

<comment>Presumptions about the people you are discussing with are idiotic. But here let's take your silly logic forward.If the woman wants to kill their 2 year old child is that okay? They're making up their own minds.And, don't like rape? Just don't do it.</comment>

<comment>Now you're just being silly.</comment>

<comment>Isn't the legal standard viability outside the womb?  You recognized earlier when you were engaging in sophistry; why not this time?</comment>

<comment>While it may seem like that because I'm really not interested in going further with someone that has no intention of putting forth anything other than sound bites; it's not really sophistry. Yes, the arbitrary line we draw for when an any reason abortion can occur is based on viability outside the womb, but that's at about 20 weeks pregnant at this point. But the lines of don't tell people what to do with their bodies, or let women make up their own minds (about things like abortion); are really just hollow rhetoric. The first is pointless as an argument since someone who is pro-life would view a fetus as a distinct living human. There's not much you can do factually to counter that point. The second is in a similar vein. In both cases, why does a woman's, or any person's really, thoughts trump those of another human, specifically one that has done no wrong.Back to the viability standpoint since it's part of my "2 year" quip. When we talk about whether a fetus can survive outside the womb, or as some like to say, on its own; it seems entirely arbitrary to me. A child up to let's say about the age of 8, probably couldn't survive on its own. If you're willing to kill one because of low survivability, why not the other. And "because it's been born"  just isn't valid to me. There's not really anything significant about a baby leaving the uterus. That baby could've left a week or two before and just been fine (assuming birth happened near the expected date).</comment>

<comment>"There's not really anything significant about a baby leaving the uterus."Sorry, but I'd imagine most people consider birth to be a hugely significant life event. A formative one, even. Life-giving, one might say.</comment>

<comment>First, medically speaking. Second, "life-giving", they'd be wrong and against all science on the matter.</comment>

<comment>They're not into discussion. Human beings don't give birth to horses, but somehow this commenter has managed to argue that human life isn't worth protecting b/c very small things look alike. The fact that they're not alike isn't worth considering; and so they can safely, but sadly, be ignored.</comment>

<comment>Do you miss points intentionally, or is it just an issue you have in general?</comment>

<comment>Any biologist will tell you a baby is alive before they are born.There is a difference between necrotic tissue and live tissue. The fetus becomes a baby when it draws that first breath. Until then, they are a fetus, not a baby.</comment>

<comment>Well that was a non sequitur. First you don't know what necrotic tissue is, and second life is not defined by when someone first starts "breathing." When you talk about necrotic tissue, what I think you mean is the difference between anabolism and catabolism. And throughout the period of life of a baby known as the fetus, there is clear growth, i.e. a higher rate of anabolism to catabolism.</comment>

<comment>It is the point when fully distinct personhood is finally achieved (also possible by Caesarian section).</comment>

<comment>It is a biased source. At least I supplied some, unlike you. Dismiss an opponent? I did respond to you. I said that women want abortions and therefore go and pay for them and are empirically shown to be happy with their choices. That is in response to you saying women are pressured into the decision. You said they didn't! You said they are pressured by a capitalist society, and didn't really want their abortions, and that's why they regret them (something which you still haven't substantiated by the way.) My argument isn't wild. What categorizes wild even? There are different issues, no where did I sign something saying that I had discussion parameters when talking to you. Erratic means, "unpredictable."  So? Who cares? Are you tired honey? Relativism hasn't been trounced. We are back to the point of contention that if a dead body can control it's own organs better than a live woman, then that is truly not right to force a woman to gestate and give up bodily autonomy.Not a gender major for sure, but your effort at trying to appear cultured and relevant is hilarious. I'm an extremist it's true. Abortion should be on demand without apology, and certainly not to nutnuggets like you. *I would try to insert more cultural references so I appear young and hip with the times, but I find my argument is valid without trying to appear like an expert on womyn by referencing all the feminists and notable authors I can think of" wait....Susan B anthony! Maya Angelou! Voltaire! Nietzsche! Camus!Wow, that end sentence really nailed it. I win :)</comment>

<comment>Other readers, I responded to Dani further up-thread earlier. I won't be responding to someone who calls me "nutnugget" and uses condescending, sexist phrases like "Are you tired honey." Or to someone who references Susan B. Anthony in the midst of a diatribe, without apparently realizing she was adamantly opposed to abortion.The fruits of her worldview speak for themselves.</comment>

<comment>"How sad to see women lining up behind them, defending men's rights to walk away from women they've used" that's sexist! "You come across like a college student in her third gender studies semester. " that's WAY more sexist than calling you honey. But maybe the truth is that you are also a jerk :)"and you're clearing coming from a passionate, emotional situation." hahah, maybe I'm on my period too?that took  me 5 seconds to put together, so you could see what sort of garbage you write.</comment>

<comment>I stand by the first and third. You are being passionate and emotional. Nothing wrong with that, I'm emotional about it too. But anger notoriously clouds logic. It has nothing to do with being on one's period. Don't put words in my mouth.The second wasn't sexist; you are making the same arguments I hear being made from people in intro classes. BUT, the remark was intended to be condescending and rude. I apologize, no excuses.</comment>

<comment>Intro classes to what??? You are so condescending it's incredible. You have NO research to back up what you say, you then quote me a student group who support their assertations by using incredibly outdated information and you have the audacity to tell me I'm the one who doesn't know what I'm talking about. This has been disappointing. But I seem to run in to that a lot with people like you. Lots of opinions, no research. It gets so old.</comment>

<comment>I also referenced Nietzsche and Camus, they were about as relevant. Obviously that one went WAAAY over your head. This was fun. Bye.</comment>

<comment>Christ almighty, what is it with your need to jump to conclusions? I read Nietzsche when I was 17. Didn't like him. Like The Plague - that's my favorite Camus. When it comes to existentialists I've always been a Kierkegaardian, hands-down. When it comes to philosophy, I'm more influenced by Jacques Ellul, Ivan Illich, Simone Weil, Iris Murdoch, and Wendell Berry.Read a book. Name-checking two of the most famous existentialists in pop-culture doth not a PhD candidate make.</comment>

<comment>Oh my god. I was making fun of you! Look! Hillary Clinton! Phillip Seymour Hoffman! Beethoven! My mommas left foot!  Do you get it? The names aren't relevant. I was making fun of you name dropping. Who gives a shit."I read Nietzsche when I was 17. I do declare Mabel, this cognac is not cognacy enough. Please esconce me away to the chateu I'm ready for my interview with madame. Please make sure the salon is well stocked with saffron and smelling salts. My delicate resolution surely could not support the pandering intellectualism of the proletariat!'=YOU</comment>

<comment>I think this is a good video, it may be useful to you in your discussions. The parts that this pro-choice, abortion counselor, and victim of abortion, talk about which really move me are her gentle explanation of her thought process, and the journals in the recovery room. That last part starts around the 20:00 minute mark.There's lot of us converts out there. Be gentle; you may find yourself among us one day. I certainly never thought I'd be here.</comment>

<comment>Was there supposed to be a link attached to that?</comment>

<comment>Oh I'm sorry, I forgot to attach it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>If all you have to rely on is anecdotal evidence (also you never actually addressed the HUGE problem that your so called "proof" that women regret abortions is studies from the 70's and early 80's!!)  then there really was no reason for me to have even engaged you.Your ego is writing checks your brain can't cash on this one.</comment>
