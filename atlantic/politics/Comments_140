<comment>Bill Maher, himself a bigot against religion in general and Islam in particular, deserves partial blame for inflicting Ann Coulter on the country. He could find responsible conservatives for his show, except that he looks to generate heat, not light.</comment>

<comment>You sound kind of butthurt about Ann Coulter. All she has is her opinions. You could turn off the Maher show if she is on.I turn off NPR all the time when they start in with the predictable progressive spin.</comment>

<comment>I stopped watching Bill Maher years ago. Leaving Ann Coulter out of the equation, he's a smug Backpfeifengesicht [face that begs to be slapped].</comment>

<comment>When the uber-prog Maher is too right wing for you, then you are officially a left wing nut job.</comment>

<comment>Personality, not politics.</comment>

<comment>I think progressivism transcends the left-right dynamic more than people realize.  When I first read Beinart years ago I would have sworn he was a neo-con.  I think Frum is a neo-con yet progressive at the same time.  Progs care more about paternalistic government.  They do not want governing to be left in the hands of ordinary people.  This is why they see no issue with insulting Americans who do not have college degrees.  Progs are not necessarily left wing, though mostly they are because leftism is about authoritarian government and this dovetails perfectly with the prog agenda.</comment>

<comment>Progressivism is a fancy name for Communism/Bolshevism.Go to the graves of 22 mil in Southern Russia and ask how they liked it.</comment>

<comment>You're confused. Progressives and communists are as different as conservatives and baby rapists.Historically, some of the world's most strident anti-communists have been progressives. Not all of them, of course...</comment>

<comment>The "Mad" in "The Mad Jewess" refers to the fact that she's nuts. She lied about me repeatedly, and then threatened to report me to the feds for pointing out how she was lying about me.She might as well be getting a check from OFA or the Hillary campaign, if she isn't already.</comment>

<comment>Sorry sweetie pie. I am a Jew from NYC.  Have met more than my share of X-Commies and radicals.ALL of them say that 'Progressivism is just a fancy word for Communism'</comment>

<comment>I don't believe you are Jew. They're supposed to be quite smart, so they wouldn't confuse a nineteen century ideology with another more modern and different</comment>

<comment>Fine, whatever.Have a nice day.Merry Christmas</comment>

<comment>Happy hanukkah</comment>

<comment>If only you could of met some nice fascists in Germany some years ago.  Or, perhaps in Poland.</comment>

<comment>I didnt need to, I had a Jewish Grandmother</comment>

<comment>Right.  Hitler was a communist.</comment>

<comment>He was a leftist.</comment>

<comment>Oh please!  Go find yourself a nice Christian baby and have a nice holiday meal. </comment>

<comment>Yeah, thanks for reminding me of my insatiable appetite for gentile babies in my chicken.Merry christmas</comment>

<comment>Down with all Zionist swine!</comment>

<comment>Merry Christmas</comment>

<comment>Totally confused...Think first, then type. Make a draft if you have to, then post.</comment>

<comment>Latest poll has Trump 35%, Rubio at 15%.</comment>

<comment>The only polls that matter are the upcoming primaries and caucuses where this clown will be handed his walking papers.</comment>

<comment>Doubt it.  </comment>

<comment>People said the same thing about Herman Cain in 2012; where is he now?</comment>

<comment>Hey "Deus ex iguana":1. Over the next year, what are the chances of Trump's "keep Muslims out temporarily" plan actually being enacted?2. If Trump's plan isn't enacted, what plan is going to be used instead?3. Are all Trump fans in the pay of OFA and the Hillary campaign, or does it just seem like that?</comment>

<comment>Rubio is immature and has no chance.  Cruz is a crackpot who deserves at least a little of what they are trying to do to Trump.  Cannot win.  Hillary has no excitement going for her.</comment>

<comment>"Deus ex iguana":I posted three questions for you. Why can't you answer any of them?</comment>

<comment>There are lots of valid concerns about Trump.  It is him or Clinton (or Cruz or Rubio).  I think Trump is best among these options</comment>

<comment>You've had two tries. Would you care for a third to finally try to answer my questions? Or, will you just admit that you're incapable of answering those questions?</comment>

<comment>I just said you were correct basically.  A lot of what Trump says is not supported by specifics and may not be realistic at all, or even feasible..  WTF do you want from me?</comment>

<comment>What I want from Trump fans is for them to pressure him to use better talking points and to stop doing stupid things. He takes a good idea - keeping terrorists out - and then has to dumb it down to the Teaparty level, thereby rendering that original good idea ineffective. If he'd said what Murdoch said and had come up with a plan to make it happen now, he would have done a great service. Instead, he just plays to the worst instincts of some of the worst non-criminal people in the U.S.Specifically, what I want you to do is to tweet @DanScavino, @womenfortrump, @joshfornhsenate, @heytana, @jerrydelemus, @kwrcrow and others and urge them to get Trump to use my better talking points. You can do that, will you?</comment>

<comment>I cannot argue with this.  I do write along these lines in other threads.  Sometimes I think Trump is just giving it all away, like he has it within his reach but then he shoots himself in the foot.  I do agree that in order to win he needs to be more specific and better on substance and obviously commit fewer gaffes.   Part of his appeal is he is un-scripted so he gets a huge leeway compared to other candidates.  He does communicate well though.  He does need to focus and clam down.</comment>

<comment>Indeed. But, tell what do you think about it?</comment>

<comment>Neocons are progressives.  They were originally New Deal Democrats who split during the '60s to the GOP.</comment>

<comment>What a bunch of utterly empty, media addled gibberish.It's as if you've ceased being human and simply morphed into a huge pile of labels and mindless, robotic boilerplate mainlined from right wing hate-fests for God knows how long.It doesn't matter what the topic is, what the article is - out comes this bizarre string of predictable, lazy buzzwords you sadly mistake for thinking.You're unable to respond lucidly or with any recognition of real humanity outside of this addiction to labels at all anymore.You right wing robots are pathetic, scary - need media detox badlyGet.a.life.</comment>

<comment>Beinart is actually just an idiot.   Frum has a point of view.  I don't always agree but at least he isn't completely dogmatic about it.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, 'only leftists forward to change!'Like a good Trotskyite</comment>

<comment>Nothing in the post to which you are replying implies that lost in the stars finds Bill Maher "right wing".</comment>

<comment>What a beautiful word. I love German.</comment>

<comment>Das ist gut.</comment>

<comment>The definition I have seen / which I prefer is "A face in need of a fist."</comment>

<comment>The literal, non-idiomatic, translation is cheek-whistle-face. http://www.germany.info/Vertre...In addition to Maher and Coulter, my list of people with this quality includes James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, Allen West, Alan Grayson, Joe Buck, Keith Olbermann and Daniel Tosh.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz epitomizes backpfeifengesicht in appearance, demeanor, and ideology.</comment>

<comment>Agreed</comment>

<comment>My favorite Cruz evaluation showed up in the grey lady last week.Another Bush 2000 alumnus said to me: “Why do people take such an instant dislike to Ted Cruz? It just saves time.”</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is ugly. That's why people take an instant dislike to him. Bigotry against the looks challenged. Simple as that.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps.   But it seems a persistent dislike.Anyone but Cruz: That’s the leitmotif of his life, stretching back to college at Princeton. His freshman roommate, Craig Mazin, told Patricia Murphy of The Daily Beast: “I would rather have anybody else be the president of the United States. Anyone. I would rather pick somebody from the phone book.”</comment>

<comment>Hillary's roommate at Yale told a NYT reporter that Hillary only changed her panties once a week!  I was in the room at the time.  Naturally it wasn't printed, even though another source confirmed it.</comment>

<comment>Obama doesn't look like a total dork?  He makes Urkel look like Denzel Washington.</comment>

<comment>Then why does Billary have such a good following?</comment>

<comment>I'm stealing this! Thanks</comment>

<comment>Zwei oder drei backpfeifen!  "Two or three smacks!"</comment>

<comment>I first saw that word a few months ago when someone applied it to ... Ted Cruz.  This Ted Cruz backpfeifengesicht meme seems to have been around for at least two years:http://vixenstrangelymakesunco...Not knowing German, I am still unclear on the backpfeifengesicht concept:  it is based solely on the face, or on the personality, words, and actions of the person?</comment>

<comment>I think it basically means someone you think ought to be hit in the face because [insert your reasons here].</comment>

<comment>She's entitled to her own opinions, but not her own facts. Anyone with access to Google can refute the "facts" in her latest book.</comment>

<comment>You can keep your doctor.....Isis is contained........ Yea, those right wing b*tches sure can lie.  PS  Your entitled to sound like a jerk even though you are a jerk.</comment>

<comment>Um, no. If anyone can Google something so easily ,there would be no point to having 100 pages of footnotes and research. The fact that you think it's such a facile task to get facts shows how stupid you are.</comment>

<comment>No, you're stupid for not understanding that anybody  can footnote an inaccurate source, or omit facts. It's not as if this is an academic book subject to peer review. IMO, It's propaganda marketed as research.For instance, the 1965 Immigration Act is not Ted Kennedy's bill. He  did not write it or sponsor it. It's called the Hart- Celler act named after its sponsors: Rep. Celler and Senator Hart. Yet she always calls it Ted Kennedy's bill, which is a lie. She also fails to mention why it was passed--because we were fighting communism, and the powers that be did not think that we could make a credible case against communism in Asia or Africa if we banned people from those regions from US citizenship. 85% of Republicans voted for it.She also says that billionaire Carlos Slim influences the NY Times to editorialize in favor of immigration reform. She provides no proof of this whatsoever. She also fails to note that the NY Times editorialized in favor of immigration reform long before Slim became an investor in 2008.September 16, 2002:  "Immigration Reform and National Security" by Tamar Jacoby, NY Times"The nation needs to think again about the changes under consideration a year ago: a package of reforms that would have increased the number of visas for Mexican workers and legalized the status of many of the undocumented migrants already here in the United States."January 3, 2004: "Immigration Reform," NY Times editorial"President Bush is said to be preparing a list of principles for overhauling the nation's unworkable immigration policy. That is an excellent way to begin the new year -- Washington has not made any serious attempt at reform since the Reagan administration. " _____________________There are many more, too many to list, but you can Google them.Her welfare numbers are wrong too as she uses the Earned Income Tax Credit in her numbers. That's not welfare, but a tax refund. When the rich get a tax refund, it's OK. When the poor get a tax refund, it's welfare.Again, this is not a serious book. If she can't rely on facts to make her case, it's because she doesn't have the facts on her side.  She and Trump are trying to stir up emotions--namely fear--not have a rational discussion.</comment>

<comment>Except she did rely on facts. Far more than the average Google-searcher will, regarding immigration. She has explicitly stated this in many of her interviews regarding just these things and the methodology used to cite these things.  Is it a comprehension of all things immigration? Probably not. But it's disingenuous to assume that everything can be countered via a simple search.   A lot of her interviews have addressed the citations you've brought up.Whether or not you take it as a serious book, depends on the eye of the beholder. There are people who will dismiss anything and everything she says, based on the sheer fact that she is Ann Coulter and that she is a bigot. And the will even think they know more about x-subject than her because they "ran a Google search." to fact check her. I'm pretty sure if you are a lawyer who is under constant scrutiny, you do more than simply mention information that can be fact-checked by Google.Also, saying "Oh, Trump and Coulter are just trying to stir up fears" is hardly the way you begin a rational discussion when you begin it with a veiled insult. But, that's how everyone is coaxed into thinking these days. "Oh, you don't want America to openly love and accept everyone with open arms? You must be a bigot/racist/fear monger." It's not irrational at all to want to look after the well-being of American citizens first. It's not irrational at all to follow the law of the land before immigration.  The real question is : What obligation does America have in accepting people?</comment>

<comment>She can have any opinion she wants on immigration. She can even be a bigot. That's her business,. But you don't get to make up your own facts. And you say she under constant scrutiny? By whom? Hers is not an academic tome subject to peer review.Notice how when she debates an educated person she loses? Cenk Uygur debated her in Los Angeles and made her look like a fool. It's online. She is better on shows like "The View" or talk radio where the panel is uneducated.</comment>

<comment>I did watch her with cenk. He looked like an idiot,  feeding off the cheers of his droning  fans in the audience. It was him jerking off and everyone going along.Also, yes. She did debate people besides the view, such as attorneys,  politicians and anchors.  All of her facts have actual sources.The fact that you think CENK is educated,  wow.</comment>

<comment>No, he was taking apart her rhetorical fallacies, and it was making her angry.She "debates" on FOX News where everybody agrees with her, or on "The View" where everybody is stupid, or on "Politically Correct" where Maher protects her.</comment>

<comment>No, he wasn't. Not even close. He was going over the various things she said in the past, misquoting her and taking what she said, completely out of context.  Then he was saying "That's not nice. that's immoral" and playing to the audience.  And he kept moving to different points whenever she answered and actually explained her reasoning. Cenk is a progressive moron and he had zero facts so he tried to demagogue her stance. The only thing that got to her was Cenk completely misquoting her and her having to explain things. Almost every point he tried to attack her with, was him trying to attack her morality. Cenk is an idiot and instead of actually talking to her about immigration, he, instead, tried to go after her personally, with the audience jerking off to it. And everyone knows why he did that - because he cannot handle an intellectual exchange between Coulter.She doesn't debate on Fox news. She's on CNN, CBC, Joy Behar show (when it was on), NBC and other liberal outlets where they can't even touch her. And Mahar does not protect her. He routinely challenges her morality, insults her Christianity belief and brings on people like Ramos who tries to demonize her anti-immigration approach. Mahar does not take it easy on her, at all.</comment>

<comment>He didn't misquote her. He asked her several times to verify what she said, especially that horrible daisy cutter comment. Sick.Bit I liked the part where she says that she doesn't pander to the GOP base. She tells the base what to think.  I agree! They can't think for themselves.Has she ever seriously debated another person with a law degree in an environment where the host is not protecting her? Not that I have seen. She chooses people with less education than she so that she can appear smart.</comment>

<comment>He also kept insisting "This is what you meant when you said this" even though she was telling him what she obviously meant. He was pandering to the emotions of the audience and it was obvious. There was almost nothing about that entire interview that even centered around immigration, which is what it was supposed to be.The GOP, especially now with their backdoor dealings to try and stop Trump, is a huge problem. They're no better than the DNC. Ann hates it. Donald hates it. We hate it. Everyone hates it.She's debate a lot of people, even other attorneys. They can't touch her. And she is almost NEVER protected by the host, what are you talking about? She is usually hated by the host themselves. It isn't that she chooses people who are inferior to her in education, it's that only the people who happen to be, are the ones who challenges her. And they always fail.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's really hard when you go on "The View" and tell off Raven Symone. LOL</comment>

<comment>That shows how little you know about who she has confronted. But, the fact that you think an idiot like Cenk is a credible source tells me so much.And besides, we both know the Raven thing was awesome.</comment>

<comment>lost in the stars made a point about the poisoning of the wider culture, in response to an article about the poisoning of the wider culture, and you responded by suggesting that a single individual could simply "turn it off".That's kind of like the way my nephew seems to think that a stuffed animal ceases to exist if you hide it from him. Of course, he's only 4 months old.</comment>

<comment>Sorry that you, too, are butthurt that Ann Coulter is till "out there" performing even after you turn off the TV.Unfortunately for you, we still have free speech in this country. Maybe you could ask one of your Muslim allies to issue a fatwa against her?They seem to have more balls in pushing back against free speech than you progressives do with your "safe spaces".</comment>

<comment>I said literally nothing to imply that I'm against free speech, or that I have "Muslim allies". That's entirely your imagination; you should learn to ignore the voices in your head.My point, which you did nothing to refute, is that you entirely evaded the earlier post by lost in the stars to which, cutely, you think you actually responded.But on another note, only 13-year olds, and pre-teens pretending to be as sophisticated as a 13-year old, say "butthurt". Does your mommy know you're talking to grownups on the Internet? Be careful: some adults are predators, and you shouldn't be talking to us without adult supervision.</comment>

<comment>Dude, that's a lot of mental masturbation over a simple topic.OP is butthurt that he can't make Ann Coulter literally disappear.I suggest that turning off the TV or Youtube might be an acceptable substitute.Then you make dumb post about your nephew's stuffed animal.And now you sound more butthurt.</comment>

<comment>We cannot bomb ISIS.  That would be racist.</comment>

<comment>We already bomb ISIS.</comment>

<comment>Bombs away. The inability to differentiate between ISIS and all of Islam is the primary tell for the casually intolerant.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand why they are so intent on making 2 billion enemies out of a manageable 20,000 or so.</comment>

<comment>Who ever said bigots think logically and rationally? </comment>

<comment>Most people do in their own way. Serial killers get off on killing folks, so they do it. Most people don't like that so they make up morality and then go on talking about how evil people are incomprehensible.</comment>

<comment>But people who rant "Bigot" or "Racist" without looking at objective reasoning, data, and facts are not "logical or rational" minded. Typical low-information liberals.</comment>

<comment>Just because some people choose not to soak up and believe right-wing paranoia and sensationalism, (sharia law is coming!!) it does not mean they lack information, but it  is a cute, albeit extremely tired put down. I suspect you are once again going to complain about people insulting you. Just fyi, calling the people here low-infomation is about as offensive as you could get, so if they call you, say, stupid, unthinking, rude, unreasonable, or even a snotty-faced heap of parrot droppings, then you might want to take that into consideration. </comment>

<comment>Your party is the one that keeps calling us bigots and racists. My tame name-calling just means your party apparently sees no reason not to bring in people who want to kill us or cost billions of dollars in public assistance. Somebody has to pay for free stuff.Just visualize they are all White Christians and you might get it better. </comment>

<comment>Most of the moochers are White Christians.</comment>

<comment>You wish -racist, bigot.</comment>

<comment>I'll leave the wishful thinking to you and leave these facts over here...http://www.salon.com/2015/10/0...And how cute that you did us all a favour and signed your post with your two most prominent character traits. Saves the world from a lot of time & guesswork hey?</comment>

<comment>Salon- a total joke.Race-baiting is gone. Give it up. And the label perfectly applied to you- "White Christians". Ha</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter what you think of Salon, but you cannot argue with the fact that Red States, filled largely with White Christians, are the true moochers that the rest of us pay for, and not these invisible hordes of "people who want to kill us or cost billions of dollars in public assistance" you are wringing your hands over.It's funny that you use the word "race-baiting", yet clearly have no idea what the term even means or when it applies.</comment>

<comment>Yes you are race-baiting now. Or are you being Racist? It's your intent, but no need to call people White Christians. That's a total racist and irrelevant thing to bring up. Change it to your favorite brown skin ethnicity and religion and you will get it better. Cya </comment>

<comment>And if we refer back to exhibit A, we will find that the first person to use the term "White Christians" in this discussion was....you.Keep up the good work, you're doing great.</comment>

<comment>And you took the bait to use it in a racist comment. Own it. I never say certain races are prone to violence etc. or "mooching".</comment>

<comment>"It's your intent, but no need to call people White Christians."___Is there a less pejorative word for "White Christian"?</comment>

<comment>He said they were "moochers". Change it to another ethnicity and religion and see what happens.</comment>

<comment>YOU'RE a RACIST. Where do you think most of the Blacks live, you want to STARVE THEM TO DEATH!</comment>

<comment>Right, no white Christians in NY or California paying taxes either.  You really are an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Are you daft? Those are the states getting screwed by the Red States' white trash. If you follow the thread (read slowly), you'll see that my rebuke was directed at her irrational xenophobia. </comment>

<comment>No, those states NY CA screw their white taxpayers.  The state taxes stay in state.  Your stats include non welfare items like SS and Medicare and are meaningless because people from NY and CA retire in red states.  You are still an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Do you want some toilet paper to wipe your mouth? Coz that's a big steaming pile you just spewed.</comment>

<comment>They're not real Christians.</comment>

<comment>Got us all lumped together in one big strawman ideology that doesn't exist outside your wing nut bubble.. that's bigotry in a nutshell. Oh sorry, you are not bigots... my bad.</comment>

<comment>If you are part of the group calling us that then yes you belong well among your selective bigoted race-baiting party. Low- informationers. Ooh "wing nut" good one, but does not apply to me. I'm a moderate conservative- the majority think just like me, common sense oriented. </comment>

<comment>Common sense? Is that what we are calling rabid partisanship these days? Let's recap:Those who engage in bigotry are not the bigots, it's the ones who point it out.People who toss out memes like "low info dems" and "race baiting" are not wing nuts.It's the "moderate conservatives" that are supporting Trump.I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure anyone with any actual, real "common sense" would agree you don't have a shred of it.</comment>

<comment>Feel better now? </comment>

<comment>Same as before. Why? Oh, I'm ranting now is that it? Shall we add that to the list of your "common sense" based delusions?</comment>

<comment>Such a charmer you are. I'm sure you have/had  the ladies swooning. </comment>

<comment>Translation: "I'm looking foolish here, change the subject, quick! "Don't think my wife would appreciate you flirting with me, but thanks for the back handed complement. Do you always use sex to get yourself out of a jam?</comment>

<comment>Omg- that's not flirting-sorry to disappoint you. I was being sarcastic. And charming does not coincide with flirting or sex. A child can be charming. Look it up. I've never hit on anyone in my life. That's the guy's job; you must think I'm that desperate to go after rude, anonymous, commenters. Hilarious.</comment>

<comment>So I was right about you changing the subject because you look foolish.Thanks for the confirmation, gotcha!</comment>

<comment>Boo hoo Get over yourself. Flirting- ha</comment>

<comment>WTF?</comment>

<comment>Whatever.I'm still chuckling away at "low information". This sounds like we're back in 2004 again; when it didn't matter about the quality of what you talked about, merely the sheer volume of what you could drown people out with.</comment>

<comment>There is quality until the thread starts deteriorating with liberal name calling and personal attacks, or in this case unfounded wild accusations....liberals of course. But you angry liberals who also have "women issues" like RS will gladly upvote his arrogance to encourage him.</comment>

<comment>They always start name calling when they lose on ideas.</comment>

<comment>Err, right you are, love. </comment>

<comment>No offense intended to the sane liberals :)</comment>

<comment>Sarah rocks</comment>

<comment>Rabid partisanship? Maybe if the liberals actually thought like rational human beings instead of bleeding hearts that love everyone but America, you can talk. but no. You can't.Those who resort to calling others bigots for not accepting everyone else, are bigots. Guess which party does that. Liberals.Liberals are low information. Anyone with an iota of a brain cell would realize what an idiot Bernie Sanders is. Or how much of a hypocrite and a criminal Hillary is. But no, because they promise you free things (which aren't free) you support their liberalism policies. Liberals are low info voters. And they're lazy, too.The only ones without common sense are liberals. Fact. Liberals can't even figure out what a gender is.</comment>

<comment>You certainly are stupid, but I would not say you are rude.</comment>

<comment>For arguing with that ditz? You may have a point. It's fun though. I see you do the same exact sh!t, albeit from your creepy ass POV.Props for not setting your profile to "private" like the rest of the wingnuts.</comment>

<comment>I'm an American living in London - many parts of town are now simply off limits even to police officers  - they refuse to go there any more. They risk being beheaded- as happened recently to one officer. Sharia ghettos. Paris is even worse. Is that what you want in the States? That's what we have here because of people like you who said there was absolutely nothing to worry about. Let them in - don't be a bigot.It's not working out.</comment>

<comment>My word, you're a special kind of dumb. Please tell the people you meet in London you're Canadian, for everyone's sake.</comment>

<comment>It's too late - they already figured out I'm American...you know, the new kind of American:I sit on my butt, do nothing with my life, collect food stamps, watch daytime television, get free rent, spend everybody else's money and vote for dumbass, leftist politicians. I will probably be converting to Islam as well.And Theocracy58 - I sense it in my gut that you are also one of these new Americans!Go get a free Obamacare colonoscopy!</comment>

<comment>Good posts by you! I agree.</comment>

<comment>I said there's nothing to worry about? It's not here yet and these wing nuts are posting like it's rampant. Somehow I doubt if it's that bad in London, or even if  it is, that it will be allowed to get much worse. But "real" Amercans love sh!tting their pants so by all means, feed them.</comment>

<comment>So, there's been two major terrorist attacks in the last two months. And you just want to handwave it as some small thing, easily forgotten and continue to let Muslims in, whereas, Republicans want to play things safe. And then you slam by saying "Oh, you're just paranoid." No, we really aren't. We just aren't so naive to think that everyone that comes in, is bringing values compatible with our nation. Liberals are the dumbest people on the planet, and that's saying something, considering Muslims practice outdated laws.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha. You sound like Grandma in this clip.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>I'm not in a YouTube video moron. Grandma? Give me a break. </comment>

<comment>Who ever said liberals could think at all - I'm wasting my breath.</comment>

<comment>Endeavor to be accurate, please.....http://www.pewforum.org/2013/0.........for instance, in the Middle East and North Africa, about a third of the Muslim populaton favors executing those who attempt to leave Islam. In the U.S., 19% of Muslims state that suicide bombings which deliberately target civilians are sometimes morally justified. Yes, blanket condemnation of Muslims is stupid. So is claiming that our conflict is restricted to 20,000 Muslims or so.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That isn't what I asserted or implied. Go fight some other strawman.</comment>

<comment>and apparently 20% of Republicans support a candidate who calls fro outright murder of civilian families of terrorists!But its not fair to paint the GOP with that broad a brush huh</comment>

<comment>Do you have a cite for that?</comment>

<comment>https://www.youtube.com/watch?...just shy of 4 minutes in</comment>

<comment>No, that isn't a cite. In order for it t be a cite, you would have to actually poll Trump supporters, as ask them if thay agree with Donald Trump, if "taking out" is understood to mean killing the innocent family members of terrorists.Accurately representing mass opinion is really hard work, and shouldn't be done in a half-assed manner.</comment>

<comment>"You have to take out their families.they care about theirs lives"sorry no splitting hairs there he's saying to need to kill or threaten to kill civilian families.whether every Trump support feels that way is another thing of course.  But don't pretend he said anything else</comment>

<comment>Oh, good grief, the point is what percentage of those who say they support Trump know of this, and understood it's meaning. Sheesh.</comment>

<comment>why do you support handing over classified documents to enemies and pedophilia?</comment>

<comment>What are you even talking about</comment>

<comment>There is no data on US Muslims in the linked report.Regarding Muslims abroad: "In 31 of the 38 countries where the question was asked, majorities of Muslims say people of other faiths can practice their religion very freely. (The question was not asked in Afghanistan.) And of those who share this assessment, overwhelming majorities consider it a good thing."Do you believe that US Muslims have a right to a presumption of innocence when suspected of a crime?</comment>

<comment>"American Muslims are even more likely than Muslims in other countries to firmly reject violence in the name of Islam. In the U.S., about eight-in-ten Muslims (81%) say that suicide bombing and similar acts targeting civilians are never justified. Across the globe, a median of roughly seven-in-ten Muslims (72%) agrees. (For more details on how U.S. Muslims compare with Muslims worldwide, see Appendix A: U.S. Muslims — Views on Religion and Society in a Global Context.)"Your question is irrelevant to anything I've written, since there there is nothing that I have written that implies that my beliefs are otherwise.</comment>

<comment>O good, 2 million muslims in USA, and 20% of that is how much???  I am so very glad we don't have a problem with that 20%? NOT.   And what of those who don't believe in violence but just are passive toward the 20% who do??? And what percentage of the 80%  want to take over with non-violent tactics???</comment>

<comment>So the 1,000 being on FBI Islamist Terrorist WATCH/INVESTIGATION list are members of the Sisters of Mercy!</comment>

<comment>You are a leftist. I can tell by your total lack of contact with reality. 15% of Muslims worldwide support in spirit at least the Muslim fundamentalists. That's over 200 million radical Muslims, not a mere 20,000, who are potential threats to westerners and to western civilization. Don't you read? And as if that's not bad enough, all the homegrown Muslim terrorists have been raised in so-called moderate Muslim homes. That makes ALL Muslims suspect. But there's more. One so-called innocent Muslim provides cover for the Muslim terrorists. Because who's to tell an innocent from a guilty Muslim by sighting either walking down the street or living in our neighborhood? Get the point? So there is no such thing as an innocent Muslim.</comment>

<comment>Painting all Muslims as terrorists will hardly help assimilation.</comment>

<comment>Muslims? Assimilate? It just doesn't happen. That's the problem. The only Muslims who are really keen on our society are the initial immigrants, generally people who suffered terribly at the hands of fanatics. Their experience is forgotten within a single generation, which is why we are getting all these homegrown Muslim terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Because there are 2 billion - 20,000 people just standing by doing nothing while in the name of their religion those 20,000 are waging war.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that most of the people fighting ISIS on the ground are Muslims? All you and I are doing is making words in a screen.</comment>

<comment>"I don't understand why they are so intent on making 2 billion enemies out of a manageable 20,000 or so."___Because it would be embarrassing to admit how scared they are of a mere 20,000 people, but if it's 2 billion their fear will be justified?Because deep down they really long for the day they can say "I told you so"?Because there's nothing good on TV?</comment>

<comment>How is it my fault if god has no predictive power exists only as a unknowable pre-big bang abstraction? It's better to have adults believe in Santa Claus and Storks than be seen as a bigot against those ideas.</comment>

<comment>Most of the Muslim jihadists are homegrown Muslim men who come from "moderate" Muslim homes who've been radicalized at their mosques or online. All Islam is a dangerous breeding ground for troublemakers and mass murderers. Let's keep in touch with reality, folks. The Celebration of Diversity is a social experiment that has gone terribly awry. No racially diverse nation on earth is peaceful and tranquil. Time to end the celebration. Time to end the mindless ideology of multi-culturalism. Folks need to reject the moral superstition that drives the "celebration of diversity," Sacred Equality. There's no such thing in nature and there's no such moral ideal that can be logically justified, either. It's a religious-like dogma that the true-believers on the Left have been promoting for 250 years since Rousseau. It's time to admit that equality as a moral imperative is a falsehood that has paralyzed the Europeans' primal impulse for self-preservation leading to the present lunacy of allowing Muslims to live in their midst who are hell-bent to destroy European civilization and impose a Muslim caliphate on Europeans. Muslims don't leave us to guess. They openly and insolently tell us that's what they're up to. Only leftists who are totally out of touch with reality ignore the warning.</comment>

<comment>It works fine normally. Rome was built on it. But they didn't have to deal with Islam.</comment>

<comment>We should have a division of labor: I'll enjoy diversity and you keep an eye on the Muslims.</comment>

<comment>When you bomb a city controlled by Isis, the city next door may think twice about letting them take control.  Get it?  We bombed Berlin, not the Nazis, that is how we won the war.</comment>

<comment>All of Islam has a problem. It's not a religion. It's a political/religious ideology of totalitarianism whose goal is to take over the entire world by degrees and establish a global caliphate. If you don't believe it, read the friggin' Koran (I have).</comment>

<comment>yep, they quote a snarky piece she did.... wrote when I doubt many in the West had much better an opinion of Islam. Lets not forget what Hillary said when she was asked if we need to profile to protect the American people and she said, “we need to do whatever it takes.”</comment>

<comment>I certainly had a much better opinion of Islam ten years ago, than I do now.</comment>

<comment>"he looks to generate heat, not light."As the late great Christopher Hitchens was fond of pointing out, heat is the source of light. Real Time isn't a safe space, stick with the Daily Show if you just want to be pandered to.</comment>

<comment>Light and heat are both ultimately products of nuclear fusion. Hitchens was wrong on the physics and on the metaphor. I don't like Maher and I don't care what the actors he brings on think about public affairs.I stopped watching the Daily Show a couple of years ago, when Jon Stewart's burnout became obvious. I also don't watch MSNBC, which does a clumsy job of trying to rile up us liberals.Rather than watch WWE style debates, I prefer reading conservative writers directly at the National Review, the Weekly Standard, Breibart, etc.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes - shame on him for daring to denounce a 'religion' that advocates the overthrow of our culture and all our values. A 'religion' which beheads homosexuals, stones adulterous women, and specifically instructs its followers to kill non-believers. What was Bill Maher thinking!</comment>

<comment>How can a "Religion" advocate the overthrow of your culture, when that Religion existed before your culture was even conceived?</comment>

<comment>In the same way a law against murder dictates the punishment before the murder is committed.DUH!!!!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>Our culture and Judeo Christian values are superior to their 3rd world, backwards, violent worldview </comment>

<comment>When the US begins to follow it's so called christian values that argument may have a leg to stand on, until then it's a bit of a moot point!</comment>

<comment>Not a fan of Maher's, but love Coulter.  I believe the premise of his show was that he had people of various backgrounds and opinions and provoked them into saying stuff.  I assume he wanted Ann Coulter on share her wisdom.  She is allowed to do that, right?</comment>

<comment>I think Maher used to date Coulter.  I went to one of his show's taping and had Coulter on as a guest.  He was very strict with the audience to not boo her.  Coulter/Maher disagreed on virtually everything (and you could see that they were trying to push buttons), but you could see that they at least respected each other.</comment>

<comment>He has said on the show that they are friends.</comment>

<comment>Bill Maher is not a bigot against religion.  He certainly believes that religion is ridiculous but that viewpoint should not be given any less respect than the view that Jesus was the son of God.   Each person has the right to believe what they want to believe without imposing that view on others.....it is the satire of point of view that suggests that religious views are more holy than unreligious ones that is the source of his comedy.</comment>

<comment>Trump has the backing of roughly 35% of 30% of the country.  Ann Coulter is watched by an audience consisting of around 1% of the country.As Le Pen and Putin show, there is an audience for brashness + populism + patriotism.   Our own recent history includes the rise and fall of demagogues such as George Wallace and Huey Long, whose ascendants were fueled by circumstances unique to their era. Trump is getting the support of 16% of college educated Republicans/conservatives but 48% of non-college educated Republicans/conservatives.The better way to understand the rise of Trump is the utter failure of the elites:It is no accident that President Obama’s America has given rise to Donald Trump. It is an America that is more tribalist, where people feel more racially and religiously divided; more politically correct, where people feel less free to speak their minds; and it is an America where trust in the nation’s elites, whose skills are credentialed but unproven, are at historic lows.These are the wages of progressivism at the end of the day. Big government inevitably leads to government incompetence. That incompetence leads to growing and now dominant distrust – both in government’s basic competence, and in the values of the people who still insist upon it. Our modern elites respond to that rational distrust by smearing it as vile hatred, which further divides and toxifies our politics. And Trump is a perfect personality to exploit these divides, offering the promise of an authoritarian who represents the people in place of an authoritarian who represented the elites.http://thefederalist.com/2015/...In other words, if the working class had more reason to believe that their government was both competent and was looking out for them, there would be no oxygen for the likes of Trump.</comment>

<comment>Average people have a sense that there is an elite nexus composed of Ivy League professors, DC lobbyists, Hollywood, Silicon Valley billionaires and Wall Street investment bankers.  The Bushes, the Clintons, etc.People do not like it yet find it difficult to fight, since the tentacles of it are mostly hidden.   At least, supporting Trump gives one of the few tangible ways to resist.</comment>

<comment>Maybe Trump will have the guts to demand the real birth certificate?</comment>

<comment>You can't credit Obama for that.  It was the Republicans who chose his final-round debate opponents.  They should work on their selection process. </comment>

<comment>You're too sane for your brethren.If they win the primaries, Clinton will be president.  You know that, but can you do anything about it?</comment>

<comment>Remember, with guys like Adelson hanging around, it's worth questioning whether Trump is truly the crazier one.</comment>

<comment>It's unclear to me if it's better - in the long run - for my tribe to nominate a Cruz and then get shellacked.The Dems had to spend 12 years in the wilderness before Clinton emerged.  It's true that the Dems benefit from the changing demographics, but I think they'll been a bit fortunate that two incredibly talented politicians - Clinton and Obama - were their torch bearers.Clinton won two elections when the country was well to the right of where it is now - because of his talent.</comment>

<comment>Clinton was indeed a master level politician. Can't deny that one-unquestionably the best in my lifetime. He was helped by the fact that Bush Senior just simply couldn't bring himself to get his hands dirty without Lee Atwater around. Bush 41 thought it was just a PR problem and that he could ride the Gulf into the White House. Atwater wouldn't have been under these kinds of illusions, especially against Clinton, who he warned people about in 1989.(Both were good 'ol Orthogonian boys from the Southern School of Scrapping Politics And Hard Knocks who were viewed as crude, lowborn provincial outsiders by the party bigwigs. They got each other very well. Clinton would have known how to respond to Atwater, unlike the hapless New England technocrat Dukakis. Conversely, Atwater would never have been as helpless as Bush Senior and his East Coast boys were against Clinton and Carville. I'm confident if Atwater lived, 1992 would likely have gone down as one of the most mutually dirtiest races in history, whatever the result. Still think Clinton would win though.Both were also kickass musicians with a taste for the blues, and both were notorious womanizers.)Obama's success, by contrast, is more due to GOP miscues than innate political talent in my opinion. Bill Clinton himself has stated that in terms of opponents, he was luckier than a dog with two **cks, and I agree with him. While Obama is good at uplifting rhetoric, and that was crucial to his success in 2008, he doesn't have Clinton's ability for "greasing politics" in my opinion. Or the ability to appeal to non-progressive/minority types. He has had a lot more help from the media than Clinton did. Obama also just lacks the amoral instinct for the jugular that Clinton (or Reagan, or Nixon, or RFK, or LBJ) had. Carter and Bush Senior had the same problem.Clinton was also by any measure more conservative philosophically and culturally than Obama. If Clinton were suddenly removed from the picture, I don't think Barack Obama could have gotten the Democratic nomination in 1996 or beat Bob Dole if he did, and I don't think Bill Clinton could get the Democratic nomination in 2016 for all the triangulation in the world due to the intense leftward pace of the party's progressive wing.</comment>

<comment>Great post!</comment>

<comment>Obama came in on a financial collapse and the GOP takeover of Congress.  While he had a majority he worked it, after that he used the powers of the executive branch to gain a second term.</comment>

<comment>I don't mean to imply the GOP isn't to blame, but relative to other Presidents who dealt with with opposition Congresses who loathed them(Nixon, Clinton), his greasing record really isn't great, and that's partially his fault. He just doesn't like going for an opponent's nuts and doesn't have the relationships on the Hill necessary.</comment>

<comment>I agree that Obama hasn't had an outside strategy. I think he decided to concentrate on governing after concluding that he couldn't actually win back a Congressional majority which is  the responsible thing to do.There are no Congressional republicans to 'work with', he tried that for two wasted years. Congress is broken because of money and the decline of the importance of party leadership in the House and the elevation of the filibuster in the Senate into a norm rather than an exception.The Supreme Court is also part of the problem that has made the US an oligarchy in law by defining money as speech.</comment>

<comment>Trump actually strikes me as a hybrid between Wallace and Perot.</comment>

<comment>He's more of a hybrid of McCarthy and Wallace</comment>

<comment>McCarthy wasn't running for President, and moreover in both MO and policy isn't exactly the right fit. Trump is not a one issue pony, whatever else he is.Wallace/Perot is much better.</comment>

<comment>It's pretty close.  Like McCarthy, Trump never seemed to care about immigration before he decided it was a hot button issueBoth make up imaginary enemies to stir people up than stand by their lies even in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary.Both combine nationalism and fear of the "other" to demagogue to the media as a means of publicity.</comment>

<comment>Wallace lost an election by being less racist than his opponent and vowed never to do that again. Trump is following that on nativist bigotry.</comment>

<comment>Perot wasn't using racial nonsense. The worst he got was using the  "you people" while addressing a predominantly AA audience. Though bad, the context of the speech was basically saying to that AA audience that they are being screwed over by the govt in ways beyond pure racial issues. Trump would have said "you people" followed up by "need to stop stealing".</comment>

<comment>*Hybrid* between Wallace and Perot, who both ran off of mass alienation with the bipartisan system.But Perot was a financially independent billionaire touting his experience in the business world. He ran on being a deficit hawk and on being an economic nationalist. That's exactly what Trump is doing. Trump's financial independence is political catnip.</comment>

<comment>In that sense you're correct, for sure. I just think that Trump's populism is almost entirely cultural, whereas Perot's was almost entirely economic, and that should be pointed out. Perot, like him or not, was actually a decent man and didn't try to appeal to voters on anything other than a serious and sincere level.</comment>

<comment>Oh, yes. I wasn't trying to imply that. Perot was definitely a more decent man. But for what it was worth, Wallace was also a genuine economic populist-it's possible to do that while being a horrible human being.A couple months ago, I would have disagreed, with Trump's plans to end the War on Drugs and tax the rich more. Trump still is invoking economics in his anti-free trade and anti-immigration arguments, which notably have gotten less frequent over the past month. But Trump has gone full Kulturkampf and less Huey Long since then, so yes. The only reason Trump gets away with that is because the base is desperate for anyone to annoy the political class. Which shows why he is ultimately not smart enough to run a third party campaign.</comment>

<comment>Trump and Perot also did wonders for SNL ratings. ;)</comment>

<comment>35-30% of Republicans, not the country.</comment>

<comment>That's right. 28% of appx. 147 million voters are registered Republicans. That leaves about 12 million Trump supporters.Which is about 6% of the entire adult population of the country...who just love them some sentient baby carrot philistines.</comment>

<comment>Most people are morons, GOP appeal to ignorance.</comment>

<comment>The GOP strategy has been to keep government from doing anything in order to de legitimate government government. and that for the advantage of the best off, especially the ,1%. To quote make the government small enough to drown in the bath tub.It isn't that government is inherently incompetent, it is that when the effort of a party is to make it incompetent, that undermines trust in politics generally.The GOP strategy has been to use bigotry and fear to reward the working class middle age white  men for the economic benefits that they are losing by deregulation, union busting, and the roll back of  transfers to states and local governments for heath care and education.</comment>

<comment>Well - I guess that's how a partisan would describe it.Take a look at NC's economic performance - before and after McCrory was able to implement his agenda, which gave your side the absolute vapors.Compare NC's job growth and fiscal condition to, say, Illinois.Republicans default to freedom and liberty, which includes letting people keep more what they have earned and keeping the government confined to its natural role.  It's the natural party for small entrepreneurs and for people who have a bias towards action.All the social wedge issues are just B.S. to fool the rubes.  The Dems did a masterful job of exploiting these issues in 2012 with the "war on women" ruse.  Republicans have used God, abortion and guns in the past, though the first two have lost the punch they had when the country was more socially conservative than it is now.So, sure, if you are on the dole or if you have a government job, or if you are in a sector where the government can usefully run interference for you or provide you subsidies, I can understand why you vote (D).But, to vote for a political party because of wedge social issues is just fucking stupid.</comment>

<comment>Trump has 30-35% of Republicans, not the country as a whole, so cut those percentages in half at least. Still it's disheartening that even 15% of Americans support this guy.</comment>

<comment>That's what I meant, "35% of 30% of the country."  The 30% are those who vote in R primaries.Yeah - I think his real support is less than 10% of the total country.</comment>

<comment>Some are bigots. Most aren't. Even fewer are murderers.</comment>

<comment>That's a pretty simple-minded and  false response.Only a few murderers are required to get goodies for the rest of them.  Are you not smart enough to understand that?  It is not really a tough concept.</comment>

<comment>Stop making an ass of yourself, Trumpeteer.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about? That's not what's going on at all.Like, okay, think of that Planned Parenthood shooter. Or that guy who shot up that black church. Or that person who shot up that school.Would you think it's fair to say 'All white men are mass murderers' because of these people? Of course not. So why would you hold all Muslims (of which there are over 1 billion in the world today) responsible for the actions of a few terrorists?</comment>

<comment>Don't forget "stupid."</comment>

<comment>You seem really really upset that people like their country. Why is that?</comment>

<comment>I love my country. Especially the First Amendment.</comment>

<comment>“It is un-Republican. It is unconstitutional. And it is un-American,”It, these statements, are stupid. There is no constitutional right of foreign nationals to enter the US. The First Amendment, which contains the right of free speech and religion has no application to foreign nationals entering the US. For example, one British guy was banned by Obama from entering the US because he sent Obama an insulting email.</comment>

<comment>If you want to ban people from conflict countries, I understand the argument. Establishing an actual religious test for entering the United States is going too far, though.</comment>

<comment>The point is that our news media is stupid. US citizens have the right to be NAZIs in terms of speech and belief. Extremist religions; such as, Christian Identity groups and the Aryan Nations, have a right to exist in the US by virtue of the First Amendment. The US has the right to bar foreign NAZIs from entering the US and also ban foreign members of religious groups seen as undesirable. This demonstrates that the First Amendment casts no shadow on immigration law.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>And the Second. </comment>

<comment>These aren't conservatives you describe in this article. These are reactionaries, with little respect for religious liberty and no confidence in America's generosity and our talent for developing new human capital while many other countries either stagnate or fail to assimilate their immigrants, or both.</comment>

<comment>So, now the open-borders prog-rino cabal that has hijacked this country wants to denigrate Americans who did not go to college (!!).Let’s examine this.  Right off the bat it seems like a suicidal strategy since few blacks or latinos go to college, so by insulting the “GOP base” you also insult the Democratic base at the same time.  But is it even smart to go to college?  Is it not really more a sign of the class and white privilege progressives have been preaching to us?  Borrowing tens of thousands of dollars to learn about micro-aggressions and safe spaces, only to return home to mom and dad to sponge off them is the intelligent thing to do now?  I thought the whole point of progressive politics was to help the down-trodden poor who did NOT go to college?  Now, the progressives are insulting these people?  What is going on here?Since the majority of Americans do not go to college, I wonder if this is a wise strategy.  I think it will help Trump.</comment>

<comment>That's a good point about progressives elites insulting and patronizing people who did not go to college. The Democratic base.I am going to use that point every chance I get. Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Sigh. It annoys me too. I was the first in my family to go to college. My younger siblings and cousins are now racking up some degrees from prestigious schools.</comment>

<comment>Not having a college degree is not a Get Out Of Jail card for believing liesTrump lies constantly.  that doesn't make him an "anti elitist" it makes him a fraud.</comment>

<comment>I'm also pretty disgusted at the smug liberal media looking down so condescendingly on Trump supporters. How many times do they have to call them "uneducated" and slightly deceptively mock them as a certain southern stereotype.Shows how phony liberals really are. With Carson, Fiorina, and Trump all running, the Dems talking points about Identity politics was all shown to be total phoniness. They only care about power- nothing else.</comment>

<comment>I'm a Northerner from the most liberal city in the country and I have two Masters degrees, and I support Trump.</comment>

<comment>I guess you didn't learn much or take an Intro to Logic course in college.</comment>

<comment>If you want to go toe-to-toe on logic I'll mow you down. Anytime.</comment>

<comment>Then defend the fact you purport to be highly educated and support a candidate who blatantly lies.  I guess the truth doesn't matter to you. It's not a matter of agreeing or disagreeing with a point of view, it's a matter of truth.</comment>

<comment>You cannot reference any Trump lies since his campaign started.The "thousands celebrating" kerfuffle does not qualify, since he was conflating true reports of that from the Middle East with other reports from New Jersey which had no numbers attached.Who you gonna defend on truth, Hillary?</comment>

<comment>Actually the thousand of Muslims one DOES qualify because when confronted with that argument he's repeatedly doubled down and said yes he was thinking of New Jersey and the real video is "out there" somewhere.Or how about that blatantly false Black Shooters document that's STILL ON HIS TWITTER?</comment>

<comment>Wahhhhh he didn't post the statistic that said Blacks are 12% of the population but commit half the murders, he posted other statistics. WAHHHH You all are so stupid.</comment>

<comment>go away troll</comment>

<comment>So you're okay with the FACT that blacks commit 50% of the murders?</comment>

<comment>I thought you were highly educated. But glad you stick up for people who were not as fortunate. This smugness by the liberal media is one of my biggest pet peeves. </comment>

<comment>A childhood friend of mine is now an Ivy-league professor.  He boasted to me about how he stayed up all night before the 2008 election making phone calls for Obama.These people are in such a bubble. They can go for months at a time and NEVER encounter somebody who does not think like them.They can live in Boston or New York and vacation in San Francisco or Europe and only hang out with other progressives.</comment>

<comment>There's no fool like an educated fool.</comment>

<comment>He's not a fool.
