<comment>Its not good for a Pope to get involved in US politics. This is not and never will be a Catholic country. Quite the opposite in fact.</comment>

<comment>So you're saying there's an antipope problem in the US?</comment>

<comment>I'm saying America was founded as a fiercely Protestant colony at odds with the Catholic French and Spanish colonies. </comment>

<comment>The U.S. then absorbed Spanish and French colonies and people for the next 200 years. Kinda lost the claim to be a protestant enclave at that point.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention that whole "Freedom of Religion" thing that conservatives occasionally pretend to care about.</comment>

<comment>Where do I say Catholicism should be banned? Where?</comment>

<comment>Look we'll just ban them until our government can figure out whats going on with that big funny hat the pope wears</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't know.  I rarely bother to read anything you post.Regardless, the religious history of the founders of this country is irrelevant, since they explicitly decided to make the country religiously neutral.</comment>

<comment>A plurality of the Founders were Deists, anyway. Including almost all the interesting and important ones.</comment>

<comment>You are attributing motives to me that don't exist. I'm just a Catholic stating facts.America has a strong antiCatholic bias that will cause Trump's feud with the Pope to work out in Trumps favor, electorally.</comment>

<comment>"enclave?" IN 1800, the population of the U.S. was far larger than that of New Spain and New France despite their enormous land area.</comment>

<comment>Mostly, but still ... There were Catholics, though they were persecuted, and Quakers fleeing religious persecution who were also some of the earliest settlers in the colonies. [Edit] And some I assume were atheists.</comment>

<comment>Maryland was originally chartered as a colony under the Calverts, who were Anglo-Irish Catholics. They also were the "founders", the chartered proprietors of Newfoundland.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - then we have absorbed large parts of Spanish and French lands. Then we got the Irish and the Italians moving in.</comment>

<comment>more like anti religious leader</comment>

<comment>It's not good for the Prime Minister of Israel to get involved in US politics. This is not and never will be a Jewish country. Never-the-less Jews and Catholics and members of any and every faith are protected here, equal under the law. And to my mind it's weak kneed, not very American, to think that freedom of speech isn't universal. Further, it's well within the Pope's wheelhouse to opine on Christianity.</comment>

<comment>CWB, while your argument is a very sound one, indeed the Pope HAS overstepped his , um, "core competency" just a tad.  Last I heard the Pope is no expert on climate change or anthropogenic global warming, but this doesn't deter him from making some very "un-pope-like" pronouncements.  How are the poor to pay for carbon offsets trading and sequestration?  The Pope is from Argentina.  Argentina's economy was destroyed by socialist Presidents Cristina de Kirchener et al.  Evo Morales ruined Bolivia's economy with his socialist mis-prescriptions.  Hugo Chaves and Nicholas Maduro managed to "snatch defeat from the jaws of victory" in Venezuela owing to their command-economy socialism madness.  Cuba's a basket case.  Brazil under the socialist-leaning corrupto Dilma Rousseff  is a basket case.   I like this Pope.  Donald Trump is on record as liking this Pope.  But this Pope is simply not infallible, and the Atlantic is way, way out of line in their desperately dishonest anti-Trump spin-tacular.</comment>

<comment>Trump called him out, he responded.</comment>

<comment>This is just more free publicity for Trump, he comes off as the one being attacked by entrenched power yet again.  He is attacked by a hypocritical Vatican that has an immense wall surrounding it.  The Vatican is a mega-force for open borders world-wide, and benefits directly from it via the drug cartels.</comment>

<comment>Poor Donald. He chucks a rock at Pope Francis and then cries. That's his MO. The Vatican "benefits directly from it via the drug cartels????"  What??? </comment>

<comment>The Donald wasn't crying. The pope took a swipe at him, and he took a swipe back -- then turned it cleverly by suggesting that the Vatican would be praying for him to become President if ISIS ever got its wish of attacking the Vatican.Gotta admire Trump's moxie. I can't imagine another politician who wouldn't have avoided a fight with the pope.</comment>

<comment>Yes, all 109 acres are protected by an ancient wall that when it was built was absolutely necessary.  How relevant to the Mexican border today.</comment>

<comment>I agree. Americans do not follow Religious leaders as to how we run our country...period!</comment>

<comment>I agree - Pope Francis is a very smart man to keep out of our politics.  But - in fact - there are millions of Catholics in this country.  Not a majority, but give the immigrants some time -</comment>

<comment>It's important for the Pope to make note of the fact that Trump's professed values are not Christian, and therefore, not Catholic.It's not a theocracy, so no one is required to take their direction from the Pope, but he'd be remiss in his duties if he didn't try to draw the line theologically.</comment>

<comment>Damn right. Separate of chruxh and state. He is telling all Catholic's not to vote for Trump. And that is fine one Executive Order and they lose tax free status. That is one thing that is against Jeb he is Catholic and these clowns think they can control him or any other of that faith. But he is a Bush, first, American, then a Catholic. American's don't like to vote for Catholic's for this very reason. The Pope should mind his own business in his corporation of kiddy fiddlers. </comment>

<comment>Where did Pope Francis tell me that I can't vote for Donald? Quote please.  I decided not to based on my conscience and common sense. </comment>

<comment>To Catholic's, Trump is not a Christian, it is implied. </comment>

<comment>How is that an order not to vote for him?</comment>

<comment>If this isn't meant to be a satirical post, you're one sick puppy.</comment>

<comment>Please explain </comment>

<comment>Really? Can you point out a single word about voting in Pope's speech on the subject?</comment>

<comment>He actually didn't get involved. Also what a weird statement on religion.</comment>

<comment>A filthy rich, religious fundamentalist foreigner who lives in a walled-off city comes and lectures Americans that the third world has the right to pick up and move itself to America, if it wants to, and that it is evil, wrong, racist, and now also unchristian for America to insist upon its borders and insist that it gets to decide who gets to come here and become a citizen...that pretty much guarantees Trump wins South Carolina...</comment>

<comment>This feud with the Pope will certainly increase Trumps appeal among Protestants and even conservative Catholics.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure anyone who thinks highly of Trump probably didn't exactly have the best opinion of the current Pope, even if they're catholic.I saw one media outlet leading with the headline of "Is this it for Trump?" and just had to laugh.</comment>

<comment>Pope Francis and Donald Trump are both very popular with non-Catholics.</comment>

<comment>What! Are you suggesting the pope won't open the gates to Vatican City -- one of the richest microstates in Europe per capita -- to the refugees and migrants arriving en masse from the Middle East and North Africa? How dare you!</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a true Christian!</comment>

<comment>So you are saying the bigots, racists, and klansmen are still going to vote for Trump?</comment>

<comment>shinynewtoken = whinybadpenny</comment>

<comment>"Let's dispense with the notion that [the pope] doesn't know what's he's doing. [The pope] knows        exactly what he's doing..." (Repeat ad infinitum)</comment>

<comment>No small irony here.  When republicans - and whatever one would call something like trump - don't like the facts, they refute them.  When science produces evidence, they deny it.  And when the pope speaks out in the interest of the poor, they denigrate him.It was not always thus, but this is truly the party of No. The party of Stupid.  The party of Hatred.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who still supports Trump at this point is probably a lost cause. Hopefully the Pope's actions and words energize people who already support Catholic causes and convinces good people who are on the sidelines or disengaged.</comment>

<comment>The Pope's comments about Trump are insignificant next to his comments about birth control from that same interview.Those comments will have Catholics wondering if the Pope has any faith in the teachings he supposedly supports. That will hardly energize Catholics.</comment>

<comment>How many US Catholics do you believe actually abstain from using birth control?How many would support the idea that people cannot use birth control even if their fetuses might contract the Zika virus?</comment>

<comment>The Pope is supposed to call us to perfection, not mediocrity.</comment>

<comment>Yes he should support a perfect wall with a beautiful Christian door.</comment>

<comment>Allowing the use of birth control when women face a physical threat has precedence in Catholic dogma. It's not some new thing this Pope just made up.[Note: Not a defense of the Pope or Catholicism, just pointing it out.]</comment>

<comment>Correct Pope Paul made similar statements in the '60s. The pope isn't condoning birth control generally. I don't get the controversy. </comment>

<comment>I'm a Democrat and I like Trump's stance on implementing tariffs on Chinese goods to revitalize the Rust Belt (and fight for social justice in the process by bringing jobs to poor black neighborhoods). Have you ever seen Detroit? Flint? Gary, Indiana? Baltimore?I also like that he doesn't want to start World War III by challenging Russia in Syria.For me, it's either him or Bernie.#DemocratsForTrump</comment>

<comment>Do your homework.  Such tariffs would cause the consumer price index - basically inflation - in America to jump > 100%.  China wouldn't pay the tariff cost - Americans would.  We're talking $700 Blue Ray disk players; $2,000 TVs; $150 jeans; $5 Bic lighters.  Sure it would hurt China because American consumer spending would majorly slow down, but it would hurt working class Americans far worse, because our discretionary spending  would cover so much less.  That means 1/2 the Xmas gifts for your kids, 1/2 the new clothes for the family, 1/2 the movies you can afford to see.Please folks, brush off your college macro-Econ books.</comment>

<comment>But the folks in Detroit, Flint, Baltimore, etc. might actually have jobs.What do we want, social justice -- or cheap DVD players?</comment>

<comment>When prices go up, consumers spend less and jobs disappear.Tariffs are the solution to economic woes that populist politicians love to support because they are beloved by gullible voters.</comment>

<comment>And what happens to American jobs when China retaliates and slaps a tariff on US exports? Brilliant idea to cut off exports to the world's largest economy. As usual Donald puffs his chest with a big threat and forgets to think of the consequences. </comment>

<comment>The trade deficit is huge. They stand to lose more.</comment>

<comment>In a trade war with China we both lose</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.  A trade war with China is just what the doctor ordered.</comment>

<comment>If the textile industry is any indication of how we vote with our wallets, then this country will choose cheap DVD players 99x out of 100.Also, the abandoned heavy industry facilities in the Rust Belt are being replaced not just in China and India but in other areas of the country (see ThyssenKrupp steel plant in Calvert, AL; Toyota in Tupelo, MS; and the Atlantic's listing of industry in Greenville, SC: http://www.theatlantic.com/nat....</comment>

<comment>Sometimes a little, old-fashioned mercantilism is just what the doctor ordered, you know.  We ARE in a global deflationary death spiral, after all.</comment>

<comment>That's what we got TPP for.</comment>

<comment>I loved Trump's response. It was perfect as well as his response in an afternoon interview. He says he still has the utmost respect for the Pope, but thinks the Pope's recent trip to Mexico is pushing him to become political and vocal on this issue. Border control position is not a test as to how strong a Christian one is. That's just weak.</comment>

<comment>Trump is an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Troll </comment>

<comment>Trumpbot.</comment>

<comment>Deporting 11 million people and breaking up families is more to the pope's point of unChristian behavior. </comment>

<comment>Yeah right. How stupid was that. While he sits with the massive wall around the Vatican.</comment>

<comment>Sarah's. Repeating. Talking. Point. She couldna thought of.</comment>

<comment>"The Vatican is surrounded by walls [of great historical significance and considered national treasures]" FTFYYou should no better than playing the false equivalence games. China has a Great Wall too, and if a Chinese politician called Trump out on his lack of common decency, would you say :but hey, China has a wall too?</comment>

<comment>A Chinese official criticizing Trump for his stance on human rights issues would sound pretty funny, that's for sure. I'd have more sympathy for your point about the Vatican's walls if I hadn't seen the Vatican, and all of it's spectacular (wonderful) excess, and stopped to think that while I was glad for the experience and the existence of the art work, it probably wasn't the sort of earthly house that Jesus would have envisioned for his chosen vicar. I'm glad that Francis has done as much as he has for shedding light on the oppressed and seeming to embrace the meaning of Christian humility and charity, and I know this has occurred to him, but his entire position - its authority and trappings - constitutes a giant hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>Which is why he chooses to sit on a wooden chair.  I am sure that Trump would revel in all the pomp and circumstance at the Vatican. I am alsosure that if Francis tried to get rid of all the trappings, there would be a major uprising in the Vatican! Sometimes you need to pick your battles.</comment>

<comment>Oh don't get me wrong. I am hardly pitting Trump's character against Pope Francis'. And Francis strikes me as an eminently practical man who recognizes and often acknowledges the Church's hypocrisy. But that doesn't mean it isn't there or that it should be off-limits when the Pope mixes in domestic politics.</comment>

<comment>But Trump did not call him out on hypocrisy, he made a false equivalency argument. People fall for straw man, false equivalency and other loci traps all the time. Which is why they end up arguing about the roast when they started out talking about the house decor.</comment>

<comment>Oh, and you managed to deflect what I said with a straw man argument. Congrats, I usually avoid those.</comment>

<comment>There's also the point that while there are walls there are also gates. Not a lot of people are kept out of the Vatican when it's open to the public.</comment>

<comment>Yes</comment>

<comment>Think of the Vatican as a gated community in Florida but with Catholics </comment>

<comment>Turning the other cheek has to do with forgiving personal affronts, not with giving up on defending the poor and helpless when some brassy Talking Yam verbally plays nanner-nanner</comment>

<comment>The Pope needs to clean his dirty house before he points out roaches in someone elses.</comment>

<comment>By that criteria, no one is allowed to say anything about anyone. And Trump couldn't run for President since his own house is dirty as hell.</comment>

<comment>I'm not setting any other criteria for this.  The Pope needs to do exactly as I say.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me, but the Pope did not suddenly begin talking about Donald Trump, did he? He responded to a question. How about you report the entire conversation.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the Vatican should disband the Swiss Guard and allow free entry to all kinds of people to St Peter's. "Ye shall know them by their fruits". You care so much about migrants, Pope man, quit talking and start acting. But don't expect others to follow your lead, especially if you're not leading AT ALL. I still remember when John Paul II fought communism. Those were the good ole' days...</comment>

<comment>If that is the racist Trumpkins response, you guys are going to lose. One doesn't have to run around naked in order to criticize someone else wearing too much clothes.</comment>

<comment>You're wrong, I'm not a "Trumpkin", I actually support Ted Cruz. And the security apparatus of the Vatican is one of the biggest in the PLANET. And please keep your race card. Like I care about the color of the mexicans' skin. I tend to care more about the rule of law and protecting American citizens.</comment>

<comment>Your Cruz is having his asshat handed to him as we speak in SC, homie.</comment>

<comment>I know. Still the best candidate in my opinion.</comment>

<comment>Two Corinthians is the whole ball game. Trump drinks his little wine and has some crackers, just like the others.</comment>

<comment>I do love Papa F but this is probably not the best route of criticism to take when you live in a country that is literally walled on four sides.</comment>

<comment>Those walls were built in the 9th century when there were constant wars. They weren't built to keep out migrants. Hello? Learn some history.</comment>

<comment>This is the Internetz. Hello? Learn some humor.</comment>

<comment>It seems the pope failed to mention people should not be breaking the law by crossing the border illegally. </comment>

<comment>Its illegal to steal bread if you are starving, but I doubt the Pope would condemn that either. Though Trump probably would.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. There is no comparison. A lot of criminals are illegally crossing our border and killing people.</comment>

<comment>May you one day reincarnate as a refugee & fight for survival under the very same conditions you now impose on others.Be so very careful about your karma.  </comment>

<comment>I don't believe in karma. I am talking about the criminals who cross over into our borders. Try and cross into Mexico's borders. You will be locked up. The Mexican government is hypocritical.</comment>

<comment>Trump's statement,  “I can promise you that the Pope would have only wished and prayed that Donald Trump would have been President because this would not have happened”, is telling.  It tell us that he is a frightened child projecting his fear onto the Pope.  While it's doubtful the Pope fears either God or death, Trump panics at the mere sight of Megyn Kelly.</comment>

<comment>The Pope should worry more about the pillars of the Church busily raping altar-boys from behind the WALLS of Vatican City.</comment>

<comment>Sure, fear of ISIS is just silly, right? After Mosul, after Palymyra, after Paris, who could worry? Just because ISIS says their top ambition is to defeat the "army of Rome", there is no possible reason to worry. I'm sure the hundreds of thousands of Mideastern 'refugees' flooding into Europe all have peaceful intentions.In case I haven't made myself clear: you are a complacent little moron, you and all your progressive brethren. Civilization is not a suicide pact.</comment>

<comment>"Sure, fear of ISIS is just silly, right?"Yeah, pretty much - certainly, to the extent some embrace and sell it.  ISIS has one primary means of inflicting harm on Americans - inciting fear that causes overreactions.  As you're aware, they've already kicked your ass.</comment>

<comment>"......and said it’s “disgraceful” for “a religious leader to question a person’s faith.”Apparently Trump has never been to church</comment>

<comment>Trump has a point about restricting immigration from Syria, which we are at war with, whether our leaders want to admit it or not. I'm a Democrat, and even I can see this. National security is not a partisan issue. There are people in Syria whose homes have been blown up and family have been killed because of our arming of terrorists/rebels, not to mention our current bombing campaign.If you don't think ISIS has dreams of coming through the southern -- or northern -- border and bringing in a dirty bomb or a small weapon, you're crazy. ISIS has already stated it plans to hide terrorists in with the refugees, which it has already done in Europe (some of the Paris attackers had recently arrived from Syria).As for the illegal Latin American immigrants, I'm largely a fan -- they bring a lot to this country. But I'm not willing to sacrifice national security just because of my affection for Latin American immigrants.</comment>

<comment>You seriously think we, the United States, is currently at WAR with Syria?  Do you even know what war officially represents, according to the Constitution, how & by whom it's officially declared?Good God, where do we even BEGIN with such flippin low-info people???:headslap:</comment>

<comment>Proxy war. We've been dumping arms to the moderate terrorists/moderate rebels/ISIS or whoever they are for years now. Arming -- intentionally or unintentionally -- groups who rape and pillage isn't exactly a way for us to make friends of the Syrians who are victims. Also, how do we know those young men we bring in weren't affiliated with ISIS? It's not like Syria has a modern database of criminals, especially now.http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</comment>

<comment>The Pope is quite right about Trump. Trumps words and are not of compassion for others. Round up millions of people some who have been here and called this home for decades! Then to ban all Muslims from coming here. Don't allow refugees mostly women and children from war torn countries from coming here. All this is far removed from WJWD that's for sure. It's gets worse and worse where Trump is concerned. First the U.K discuss banning him from their shores! Now the Pope is calling him out for his hate filled rhetoric toward others! You have to wonder what it will take for Trump supporters to wake up and get a clue about this blowhard who cares nothing for anyone other than himself. Can this fool embarrass the country anymore?</comment>

<comment>Not a christian actually means more common sense.</comment>

<comment>The Pope's home Vactican City is the richest nation on Earth, with a per capita income of roughly $366,000.It is a walled country.If there's any country keeping people out, it's Vatican City.</comment>

<comment>I got into Vatican City without anyone checking my immigration status.</comment>

<comment>Those walls were built in the 9th century.</comment>

<comment>They still seem to keep people out. Vatican City is Elysium.</comment>

<comment>Another interesting tidbit about Vatican City: Vatican City is the only country where men but not women have voting rights.</comment>

<comment>It's also one of two (I think) that outright ban divorce (the other is the Philippines).</comment>

<comment>Uh, you realize that almost no civilians actually reside in the Vatican; right?  It's more comparable to a giant embassy than country.  Wherever one lives, the Catholic Church rarely recognizes divorce.  Has nothing to do with the actual Vatican.</comment>

<comment>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Uh, the Vatican's not a representative democracy, Einstein; its affairs are official church business, and yeah, since only guys can be priests, only guys determine Catholic Church & Vatican business.News flash:  Women can't be popes!!!!</comment>

<comment>I'm simply stating a fact. You can rationalize all you want. Sorry if I offended your Catholic sensibilities. I personally have disdain for superstitions that keep women down. Vatican City is a country.</comment>

<comment>Trump is planning to protect the Vatican from ISIS?WTF?</comment>

<comment>You know, of all the ways I thought he might respond, that might have been the last thing I expected him to say. What a bizarre answer.</comment>

<comment>His megalomania knows no bounds.</comment>

<comment>Anyways, what is going in regards to all the child molestations and the Catholic church? It seems they try real hard to wipe it under the rug and not discuss it. The Church seems to be more of a financial pyramid scheme than a religious institution....</comment>

<comment>I bet most Trumpkins touch their children.</comment>

<comment>Why not talk about trump wanting to shag his daughter ?</comment>

<comment>The Pope is an atheist and communist and clueless pawn for the drug war.  He was elected because he could plausibly ignore the mischief at the Vatican while gently chastising its leadership and sanctimoniously berating the rest of the world.  His 'message of peace and love' can be summarized as "from each according to their abilities, to each according to their needs."  He demonizes western hedonism as vehemently as any islamic cleric.  Trump is right to say he's not 'Christian' but who is these days.  Certainly not Trump but who cares.  The point is that he issued an invitation for ISIS to attack the Vatican, which of course only excites his followers even as they wimper "Ima skerred them terrists gonna get us."</comment>

<comment>The Pope is an atheist? You are so lost.</comment>

<comment>I think he means that his faith is a mask for his personal ideology, which is contrary to scripture.</comment>

<comment>Well Catholics do have an interesting relationship with Scripture.</comment>

<comment>Yes, they defy it.</comment>

<comment>Irresponsible birth  rates in your country does not constitute a viable excuse to move to my country.</comment>

<comment>Native Americans have been saying that for years.</comment>

<comment>How did mass immigration work out for them?</comment>

<comment>It resulted in the genocide of millions of Native Americans.I hope our chickens are not coming home to roost.</comment>

<comment>Let's not repeat their mistakes.</comment>

<comment>Everyone is not as sadistic as the American settlers.</comment>

<comment>The newcomers will use the ballot box to take what they want instead of bullets. The result will be the same.</comment>

<comment>I don't know how much influence the Popester has over American Catholic voters, but Trump sure has a way of making unnecessary enemies. What a blowhard.</comment>

<comment>Talking about  " unnecessary enemies", how about Cruz's " Liu Xiaobo Plaza" bill?</comment>

<comment>The pope's denunciation of 'rump, although true, is beyond hypocrisy. Neither of them are Christian.</comment>

<comment>I've been watching CNN on this (having a sick day), and a lot of these reports are somewhat misleading. The pontiff never named Trump; what he said was that anyone who wants only to build walls and never bridges was not a Christian. It was a broader, more general statement than "this man isn't a Christian because of his position on one single issue". That's not a full and fair characterization.</comment>

<comment>And are there really people gullible enough to believe that Trump is a Christian?  The media has made a controversy over the Pope not specifically calling Donald Trump a non-Christian, which he obviously is.</comment>

<comment>Apparently there are, and this appalls me. He's given his denomination as Presbyterian, and named a church he says he belongs to in NYC. But that church says he never attends - and, they are Reformed, not Presbyterian. His comments about "my little wine" and "my little cracker" are not the language of a "churched" person. What his other beliefs may be are of course between him and God, but I have yet to see evidence that Trump believes in anything more than Trump.</comment>

<comment>Two Corinthians go into a bar and have some little crackers and a sip of wine.  Yes, blatantly obvious if you're not blinded by fear or bias or wishful thinking.</comment>

<comment>Two Corinthians and Donald Trump walk into a bar. Bartender looks up and says, "What is this? Some kind of joke?"</comment>

<comment>Four Corinthians go into a bar looking for a fifth ...</comment>

<comment>These two men are at complete opposite ends of the spectrum as far as caring for the poor and trying to be servants to others. Trump is not worth the pope's time.</comment>

<comment>I have always been respectful of the RCC, and will remain so, but they DID royally screw up by electing this guy. He’s an embarrassment to his position, to the Church.He pushed the European open doors to “refugees” or “migrants” while hosting exactly ONE family that just happened to be Christians.He is fully protected by Italian authorities on one side of the Vatican City and the Swiss Guard within. Unbelievable what he expects of US. He wants us to educate/fee/shelter those who would dishonor our sovereignty. Shame on him.Trump is right.</comment>

<comment>Just what is it about TRUMPy that make people like you defend him?</comment>

<comment>He speaks plainly, he speaks the truth and he's pro-American.How come you don't like that?</comment>

<comment>He needlessly insults others, he lies continuously and is only interested in what benefits trump.  How did you become so gullible ?</comment>

<comment>You just described Obama and Hillary.</comment>

<comment>He does NOT speak plainly, he says NOTHING of substance. Saying he is going to eliminate the ACA and replace it with something WONDERFUL is not speaking plainly.He would not know the truth if it bit him on the ass. "I saw thousands cheering" as the towers fell is only one of his massive LIES.He is NOT pro-American, he is pro-TRUMPy. He does nothing but denigrate America and any Americans who do not fall for his BS. You apparently do.</comment>

<comment>His 'something wonderful' is single payer. </comment>

<comment>Wow.  You are clueless.Trump does not speak plainly?  Have you ever heard the man speak?   Apparently not.Trump is not pro-American?   Now you are being really silly.</comment>

<comment>One can speak plainly without saying ANYTHING of substance. To listen to TRUMPty DUMPty speak you would think the US is the worst country in the world. He cannot open his mouth without denigrating it and the people who elected the current POTUS, overwhelmingly, TWICE.</comment>

<comment>Obviously you are not listening to what Trump has been saying and you are forming opinions what other people say about him.Trump wants to make America to be great again and that's what I want too.   Trump loves America and he doesn't think we are the worst country in the world but he understands we are currently a nation in decline with some serious problems.   The people who support him understand this as well.</comment>

<comment>A nation in decline? We have the highest standard of living on the planet and it is getting better all the time.</comment>

<comment>But that only counts when it's WHITE guys in charge! </comment>

<comment>I have watched TRUMPy DUMPy many times. He does nothing but repeat the same lame slogans over and over again, most of them totally stupid, like "we can't just leave people in the streets to die", as though that actually happens in this country, and we don't have medicaid to care for the indigent. He offers NO solutions, just slogans, like his silly wall which is not only unbuildable (it crosses 1200 MILES of desert, and TWO mountain ranges), but he hasn't a clue that he has no way of forcing another sovereign state to pay for it. There are just enough stupid people for him to get away with that crap.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't and isn't. He's a demagogue in every respect. And you're simple for buying it.</comment>

<comment>Nativism ?  Lack of intelligence ?  Masochism ?</comment>

<comment>Feeding and sheltering the poor is base line Christian belief. It is a fundamental contradiction (hypocritical) that people proclaim their Christianity while ignoring the behaviors that Christ advocated to his followers.</comment>

<comment>Trump’s rhetoric on enforcing the law (see: rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s) strikes me as completely Christian. Charity is an individual virtue, exercised within the bounds of the law, and there is no virtue in generosity with other people’s money or country, or in rewarding the criminal behavior of illegals who broke the law to come here.  Too bad this Pope is tinged with too much left-wing politics.</comment>

<comment>Christ was all about building walls between people. it's right there in the bible</comment>

<comment>No, Christ was not all about that.   I'm assuming you are being sarcastic.Check out this picture of the Vatican.   What do you see?  http://therealrevo.com/blog/wp...How many refugees/illegals are now living in the Vatican?The US has a duty to protect its borders and to only allow those people into the country who follow the laws the US has established. There is NOTHING unchristian about doing so.</comment>

<comment>I see an antique wall built during the bloody, 9th Century Crusades....which I'm concerned Trump seems eager to emulate.  </comment>

<comment>“If and when the Vatican is attacked by ISIS, ...,”News flash ISIS has been targeting Christians and Catholics [plus Jews, Muslims and all other faiths the world over] since inception.  I haven't seen the Vatican brushing off these attacks as implied by the statement.</comment>

<comment>For decades the Catholic Church has worked hand in hand with the corrupt Mexican government and the drug cartels.  Check out Don Winslow's fantastic novel "The Power of the Dog" and "The Cartel".  He spent a decade researching and connecting the dots.  The Vatican is the direct beneficiary of the drug cartels' blood money.   The Vatican has an enormous wall around it, and quite frankly is an abomination when it comes to wealth inequality.  It sits proudly in the top .000001% in wealth.  It pays not a cent in taxes to anyone since it is a sovereign nation.</comment>

<comment>The pope has a really impressive real estate portfolio. You'd think Trump would respect that</comment>

<comment>"To be fair, Trump started it."Thank you for beginning that way because Trump and his legion of cultists seem to have missed that.But that is standard for this man child. Whenever he goes after someone he pretends that they started it. Like a 10 year old.That is what we are dealing with here.Donald Trump maybe 70 years old but mentally is never matured.I found the Pope's statement to be brilliant"A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian."This is not just about the idea of the physical wall but is more about a person who seeks to divide people against other people which has been Trump's entire campaign. he has even created an enormous divide within the GOP.Trump intentionally beginning a fight with a Pope is unprecedented and hopefully it will end when Trump's campaign ends in defeat.This is an emotionally unstable person who should never see the inside of the Oval Office without a guest pass.</comment>

<comment>Cruz wants to end gay marriage with a constitutional amendment.</comment>

<comment>And that has what to do with picking a fight with a Pope?Your guy is sick and unstable</comment>

<comment>Cruz is, that is for sure.  He is intolerant.  He is a crackpot.  A cheater and a liar.Let's also dispense with the notion that Rubio doesn't know what he is doing.  He is programmed to do exactly what Marcosoft wants.  [repeat 4 times]</comment>

<comment>The article is about the Chump - - - not Cruz or anyone else.Trump continues to show himself to be an immature  and deplorable human being.</comment>

<comment>True true. It's deplorable to point out how bad of a person the Pope is.You're a clown</comment>

<comment>Trump is going to be Dumped</comment>

<comment>You're so much safer here, huh? You can peddle your nonsense in a dark room with little disagreement. Good for you, sport.</comment>

<comment>"Pope Francis, TEAR DOWN THIS WALL"</comment>

<comment>This will only make Trump more popular. Most Catholics have wanted to tell This Pope off themselves. Most American Protestants have no special love for the Pope. Seculars appreciate Trump standing up to the God botherers.</comment>

<comment>True.If he’s going to get involved in our political process, and demand the US Taxpayer supports his beloved illegal aliens. Then I say it’s high time the Church starts paying their fair share.</comment>

<comment>Demand?</comment>

<comment>Its one thing when the Church gets involved in the politics of a government that claims to be Catholic, like the current government of Poland.It's a different thing when the Pope gets involved in the politics of a country that has never been Catholic. This could backfire on American Catholics.</comment>

<comment>Right wing cafeteria catholics dislike the Pope's politics?</comment>

<comment>Pope 'Who Am I To Judge' gay priests who abuse children suddenly becomes indignant at Christians who want reasonable restrictions on immigration.</comment>

<comment>Of course we don't. The Pope is a hypocritical moron.</comment>

<comment>I disagree. The Pope is very popular with Americans - Catholic and otherwise. 66% of Americans have either a “favorable” or “very favorable” view of the Pope (Time poll) and  87% of Catholics are fans of the Pope (Time poll).</comment>

<comment>Pope Francis’ US approval rates slump sharply, led by conservative dismayhttp://www.religionnews.com/20...</comment>

<comment>Amazing how you you just make this garbage up out of thin air without the slightest evidence of support.</comment>

<comment>It's a prediction. When has any high profile conflict not worked out well for Trump? Why would you bet against him now?</comment>

<comment>Don't worry, he's a Cruz bot. He hasn't fixed his autism setting yet.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is good people, but not presidential. I want him in Scalia's seat.</comment>

<comment>That's my personal choice too.</comment>

<comment>I would bet against Trump because in business his success is a fantasy.In politics Trump lost in Iowa and won NH because of the non-Republicans who voted.Trump is stuck at about 25% which is less than 75%.If he wins S.C. it will not be by much and only because of too many ABT candidates.After that? Bush, Carson, and hopefully Kasich drop out and Trump lead becomes a thing of the past.</comment>

<comment>Right? Especially when I won in New Hampshire, and we'll call Iowa a win too.I turned millions into billions.It's been great.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump is a freaking CHILD. The child has no respect for anyone on the planet.Anyone who supports the Trump clown is a moron of epic proportions.</comment>

<comment>Obama is a petulant child.   Do you support him?</comment>

<comment>So you think lame deflection to something you fear changes the fact that Donald Trump is a child?Okay ...</comment>

<comment>If you support Obama then you have no business calling Trump or anyone else a child.</comment>

<comment>So you think a 2nd attempt at lame deflection to your darkest fears changes the fact that Trump is a child. HA HA HA HA  ... okay ...</comment>

<comment>Not surprising that the Pope is an assclown.What have you all done to solve the child rape crisis, Francis?What about using your billions to help the needy?No?Okay then.Moron.Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Nice! Trumpites hate the pope! He's an assclown and a moron, says the Donald. Great statesman!Did you hate the pope before or is it just anyone who criticizes the dear leader must be put down?</comment>

<comment>I appreciate the endorsement from the Socialist Pope Francis the Hypocrite.Love being endorsed by him.Him attacking my faith, considering he's not remotely christian, is hilarious.</comment>

<comment>What is your faith Don? And how is the Pope "not christian?"</comment>

<comment>By his own standards, he's not Christian.Lives behind a wall with excessive wealth. Not very christian to me.</comment>

<comment>What's your faith Don? And how is the pope not a christian? I mean, don't you live behind a wall down in florida, with excessive wealth? What are you trying to say, Don? Do you have any idea?</comment>

<comment>Just using the pope's own standards to judge him as he sees fit to judge others.</comment>

<comment>I don't hate the Pope but he was wrong to pass judgement on a man he has not met and to base that judgement on second hand knowledge. He said "If that is what the man said, he is no Christian". He is also a big hypocrite. After passing judgement on Mr. Trump and saying building walls is unchristian, he flew home to live behind the big walls surrounding Vatican city. He needs to read the Bible more as there are many examples of the need for walls and the importance of protecting your own.</comment>

<comment>I'm a modern day Martin Luther.Pope disagrees with me, so I'm not Christian.Meanwhile he lives behind a wall and hoards his wealth.What a hypocritical child Francis is.Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Ok, your first sentence made me laugh out loud.</comment>

<comment>Fascinating to see the comments here--Trumps' stooges have revived good old fashioned 1850s style anti-catholic nativism! Who knew that was still a thing?  We never should have let those irish in!</comment>

<comment>That epic strawman though.</comment>

<comment>There is no better way to boost Trump in the eyes of evangelicals than a fight with the Pope.  The Pope may as well write Trump a billion dollar campaign check.  He can just give it to the vets since Trump is self funding.</comment>

<comment>This is my favorite endorsement thus far.First Obama, then Francis? My god. It's like Christmas.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Obozo really stepped into it, didn't he?  "Trump will not be the next president"  {note he did not say "GOP nominee"}</comment>

<comment>The Trump says, “For a religious leader to question a person’s faith is disgraceful.” I don't know why. He doesn't object to a great many people considering him Christian just because he says he is, with no evidence whatsoever.Actually, Paul includes this questioning in the gifts of the Spirit, in 1 Cor. 12: 9-11. The KJB puts it this way: "9. . . to another faith by the same Spirit, and to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit, 10 and to another the effecting of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another the distinguishing of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, and to another the interpretation of tongues. 11But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills."In the Church we call it "discernment of spirits." It is not only the Pope's job, it is the job of each of us who has received this gift.</comment>

<comment>I think that "judge not lest yea be judged" is more germane here.Cor. esp that passage is not on point. Not really as it deals specifically with various "gifts" not judgement in general.</comment>

<comment>As has become evident, once trump gets emotional, reason goes out the door.  And he is so easily revved up into emotional incontinence, one wonders how America would avoid continuous catastrophes and mountain-making out of molehills from his first day in office.  He is providing wonderful insight into what a disaster his 'leadership' would represent.</comment>

<comment>^Word Salad without much dressing.</comment>

<comment>It's weak boy, what do you really think about vaccines now carnival barker ?</comment>

<comment>I just find your multisyllabic nonsense to be hilarious. Please continue.</comment>

<comment>Asking if the pope was catholic used to be a joke, now it's a serious question.</comment>

<comment>That is more true than most people on here probably realize.</comment>

<comment>We don't come here to convert people.TheAtlantic is beyond saving.</comment>

<comment>It is better to ask whether he is a communist.</comment>

<comment>Do you want Trump to be the next president?  Keep attacking him.  Making him the victim is the reason he is where he is.  Take it from me, it is better for everyone if we stick to honest debate on the issues.</comment>

<comment>Right? Like honestly, if liberals hadn't pushed SO FAR LEFT on public discourse? It would be much easier for them.But they turned a Mormon, good looking, family man, into Satan for taking his dog on a trip and being a boy in school.Everything he did was part of a "war on women" and they played the race card whenever they could.And people grew tired of it.Weird right?(For the record, Mitt was a bad candidate, and he choked)</comment>

<comment>People are afraid to open their mouth and speak anymore.</comment>

<comment>.. Really? Because liberals might say something critical? You guys need to man up</comment>

<comment>Trump's support has been stuck at about 35% of GOP voters. It's not likely to get much higher</comment>

<comment>Trump is parroting liberal talking points but adding superlatives. His supporters have been bashing "libs" for years, but are too stupid to realize his positions.</comment>

<comment>God Hates Trump !</comment>

<comment>"And the TRUMP came down to see the Vatican, which the children of men builded. And the TRUMP said, Behold, the workers are United, and they have all one Pope; and this they begin to do: and now nothing will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do."</comment>

<comment>One last thing and then I have to run off...The Roman Catholic Church has allowed millions of boys to be raped throughout it's existence.I don't want to hear about my Christianity from Catholic Joe Paterno.</comment>

<comment>Go to, let ISIS go down, and there confound them, that they may not understand one another.</comment>

<comment>http://fivethirtyeight.com/fea...</comment>

<comment>Instead of going after Trump (and those who object to the massive breach of our border and raiding of our states’ and national treasuries) as not being Christian, the Pope might have addressed the nominally Catholic leaders of the countries of Central and South America who have created a situation where so many are anxious to flee, and do so at great cost and danger.</comment>

<comment>So the Trump scattered them from there back to their homes over all the earth, and they stopped building the country.</comment>

<comment>No doubt that these countries would be better off without having been a playground for reagan and other rightwing neocons intent on dictating other countries politics through political assassinations and by supplying death squads with weapons illegally obtained from Iran (not to mention the subsequent decades supplying Americans' insatiable appetite for hard drugs), but as noted in the article, the pope did precisely that.Reading skills are obviously not your forte.</comment>

<comment>So you subscibe to the notion that nations are unable to make grevious mistakes and errors all on their own?It must be the fault of the USA cause nobody nowhere is capable of screwing things up otherwise.Sheesh.You know some of these nations are older than the USA. Mexico for example. And they were models of well run prosperity then I guess?What was the date on the outrages you list above?And its the worlds appetitie for hards drugs.</comment>

<comment>Very good point.The Pope is essentially lecturing the people taking in, in many cases unwillingly, the very people fleeing deperate circumstances created by others.</comment>

<comment>1) How do you know he hasn't?  2) How the hell is that responsive to a question about Donald Trump?  Reporter: "Hey, what do you think about Trump?"  Pope: "Mauricio Macri is ruining Argentina!"</comment>

<comment>I don't really have a tempest in this teapot. However, as a tie-breaker I'd give it to the Pope, because he's got cooler hats. "Make America Great Again" on Trump's tapa is fine as far as it goes, but to get the full effect you need the smell of incense and maybe your squad rockin' their croziers.I gotta get me one of those pontifical lids. LittleWillie in a mitre struttin' down Av. La Florida, wavin' to my peeps--man, I'd blow away the barrio.</comment>

<comment>So as much as it pains me to say it---Trump was right about the Pope being a very political person?It would seem that as the article that is the case. Chump made an observation/accusation that the Pope went and proved.</comment>

<comment>Trump is basically a would-be king trying to unite the commoners against the aristocracy.</comment>

<comment>A guy that shelters kid rapist's is certainly not a Christian.Mark 9; "If ANYONE causes one of these little ones -who trust in me,- to fall into sin, it would be better for them if a large Millstone were hung around their neck and they were thrown into the sea" "Matt 23; And do not call anyone on earth 'father' for you have one Father, and he is in heaven" "Everything they do is done for show.......They make their phylacteries wide and the tassels on their garments long.....they love to be greeted with respect" Jesus</comment>

<comment>This awful man, Trump, is the son of the Devil.</comment>

<comment>Any one who is supporting Trump because they think he embodies Christian values has not paid any attention at all.As such, what the Pope has said is completely true, but largely irrelevant to Trump's supporters.  He's not a Christian in his outlook, doesn't really attend church or understand any of the elements of his supposed faith.  Trump just isn't a religious fellow.</comment>

<comment>Who cares. If he's a Christian, respects the Christians, and speaks out strongly for the Christians----that's good enough for me. You do realize there is separation of church and state. </comment>

<comment>Not a Catholic here, but kudos to the Pope anyway, who not only seems to be a very nice guy, but is also apparently pretty savvy about the media (he even has his own Twitter account). Although it is a hoot to hear the Righties get their panties all in a bunch over it… and this from the same folks who actually invited the Prime Minister of Israel over to personally address Congress, and tell us how he thinks we should run our own gubmint?!! ;-p</comment>

<comment>I interpreted the Pope's remark as saying that building a wall to divide people instead of working in harmony with them is not Christian, rather than a specific swipe at Trump (though he was the subject of the reporter's question).Anyway, how ridiculous is this controversy?  Anybody with a lick of common sense knows that Trump is not a sincere Christian.</comment>

<comment>You're absolutely right.Yet the Trump supporters are trying to twist this into "walls" and asking the Vatican to take down their wall.And anyone whose behavior is like Trump's throughout his life is not a Christian.</comment>

<comment>Well Trump loves to perpetually play the victim card ...</comment>

<comment>Trump is not playing a victim card and he did not attack the Pope first as this article states. He was told a few days ago, of the visit by the Pope to our southern border and asked his opinion of the visit. He did not attack or disparage the Pope in any way with his answer. Trump said the Pope was a political man, which has always been the case with church leaders and which the Pope himself agreed with today. Mr. Trump also said that he did not believe that the Pope totally understood what was going on along our border with Mexico. He did not use any insulting remarks or say it in a disparaging way, he simply stated his opinion. An opinion that is probably true given the answer the Pope gave while on board his plane. He said "If that is what the man said then he is no Christian" in other words the Pope himself did not know what Mr. Trump's statements about a wall have been. He based his judgement against Mr. Trump on hearsay, second hand knowledge and that is truly disgusting considering the judgement.</comment>

<comment>"If that is what the man said then he is no Christian" generates no hits in Google, Ask, Yahoo, etc. I think you shouldn't have used quotes for something that you just think the Pope said. Much better to go to the source.</comment>

<comment>It depends on how the sentence is interpreted. I have also seen it as, "this man is not Christian if he has said things like that." but it still contains the word "if". It is still wrong for the Pope to pass judgement on a person he has never met or spoken to.</comment>

<comment>Ummmm, Trump is no Christian.  That's patently obvious to anyone with a lick of common sense.</comment>

<comment>Why are liberals in such an uproar about Trump's religious practices? So desperate.</comment>

<comment>Oh puh-leez… most libs would love to see a Trump candidacy so much, they're practically PRAYING for it (to Allah, naturally)! ;-p</comment>

<comment>Sure you are. Hand-wringing all day about The Donald. </comment>

<comment>Wasn't that the same defense y'all used to defend Palin (aka, "it's not that she's a joke… it's just that the Dems are 'skeered' of her")?! ; D</comment>

<comment>Idk - not a Palin person. You've got some bigger problems to stress about with Hillary. Hillary big Christian? ha ha. </comment>

<comment>"Not a Palin person"… dang, you do a good impression!</comment>

<comment>How so? I look nothing, sound nothing like her.  Our beliefs are a little different and I'm not near as bold as her. Nothing against her, but I don't know what you mean....our name is the same, but it's a common name. </comment>

<comment>Oh geez, a Trump groupie and irony-challenged?! Well, no wonder they say that Trump's "base" tends to come from a certain, um "demographic"!Pollsters find that almost 90% of those who have voted for Trump in the polls belonged to the bottom half of the IQ spectrum http://adobochronicles.com/201...</comment>

<comment>My IQ is stronger than yours I'm pretty sure-- long line of intelligent people, not all are super successful though. And well-educated too. Sorry :(</comment>

<comment>Sorry if I mis-underestimated you…. ; D</comment>

<comment>Ok thanks. it's 'misunderestimated' smarty pants :)</comment>

<comment>I have my issues with Hillary. But she attends church regularly and can talk about her faith journey in a public forum and do it well; I have to give her that.</comment>

<comment>She is good at pandering better than Trump. Trump has spoken out about protecting Christians and calling out violence and blasting of them much more than Hillary or Obama put together. </comment>

<comment>I was referring to her own statements about her own faith, not talking about violence. She is a bit more hawkish than I am comfortable with; as I said, I have some differences with her. But I know her church attendance and I know her pastor, so I'm not about to pretend she's anything other than a Christian.</comment>

<comment>That's just awesome. </comment>

<comment>I don't know if you were being sarcastic, but yes, her pastor is pretty awesome. Ginger Gaines-Cirelli of Foundry UMC in DC. www.foundryumc.org.</comment>

<comment>Cool. :)</comment>

<comment>This is off topic, but I really admired the way that they handled the Clintons, back when they were in the White House. The Secret Service got concerned about the presence of some homeless people in the sanctuary, and wanted to remove them when President Clinton was there. The senior pastor at the time (Dr. Philip Wogaman) was adamant that they not do this. Basically said that the First Family could go anywhere, but these homeless folks needed to walk to church. So, the Service had to adjust, and over time, sort of learned which ones were harmless and which ones might get up and wander and needed to be watched.</comment>

<comment>That's nice. I do feel bad for the homeless. Some of its not their fault- a lot of mental disorders.Did you read about the foul mouth temper Hillary had toward them. It was told about in the last book. Yikes. Quite fond of slinging the f-word at people...they said.</comment>

<comment>A lot of crap has been published about her, not all of which I believe, but she does have a temper, I'm pretty sure.</comment>

<comment>But Trump has worked with people all over the world. He has done business in China, Japan, Mexico, Scotland, South Korea, and Germany to name a few. He has hired people of all nationalities and has a family with mixed ancestries and religious followings. Despite what the media and Mr. Trump's opponents have said about him, he has not said any racist or bigoted remarks about any religion or race of people. Mr. Trump has not tried to divide the US from any group of people other than terrorists. How strong of a Christian he is, is Mr. Trump's business and the last time I checked it was not a requirement for the job he is seeking, just ask Bernie.</comment>

<comment>I heard it that way, too, and I agree with what you've said here.</comment>

<comment>Bless Trump's little thin skinned heart. He doesn't like the Pope saying he is not a Christian. Don't remember Trump or other candidates who are now defending Trump over the Pope's remarks standing up against Republicans calling President Obama a Muslim knowing full well he was a Christian. Once again karma has come back to bite the haters.</comment>

<comment>You mean President Obama is a Christian.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but certain Republicans have pretended otherwise.</comment>

<comment>A little more than certain Republicans go full retard over believing President Obama is a Muslim.</comment>

<comment>And yet, simultaneously, believing that his former pastor is too radical. His. Christian. Pastor. Consistency is not their strong suit.</comment>

<comment>The great maker of the universe has one hell of a sense of humor.  RepubaRubes have the  natural ability to create a fantasy world for themselves, where they get to make up the rules of sanity as they go. </comment>

<comment>Well bless your little sarcastic heart. You know he is.</comment>

<comment>No sarcasm intended. President Obama is a Christian. </comment>

<comment>Point taken.</comment>

<comment>;-)</comment>

<comment>Hey Obama can be as Muslim as he wants. That's completely fine. </comment>

<comment>The Pope is too involved in politics. This comment is too judgy, condescending, and hypocritical....Glass houses.</comment>

<comment>I really think the pope was making a more general statement about Christians that has been somewhat twisted by some media. Fr. James Martin, SJ, did a really good job of parsing this out on CNN tonight. And I think most people have found Francis to be a very humble man and not condescending. BTW, I hope you have calmed down and are feeling better today.</comment>

<comment>Today he was condescending to question a person's faith, as a Religious leader. Trump wins in this attack. Great formal stmt he put out.And I ask you if you are feeling less gossipy and speculative today. I don't do gossip. It's too 'Mean Girls'.  I keep telling you this. This is a public forum, not a sewing circle. </comment>

<comment>I don't sew. But I do love to knit, hence the screen name. Again, I urge you to listen to the Pope's statement rather than Trump's interpretation of it. It was a more general statement about building walls instead of bridges, probably in part metaphorical. I think Trump looked bad in this whole thing, though. Really bad.</comment>

<comment>You are alone - experts said Trump got the best of the Pope while still respecting him and the position. He will prob be rewarded in the polls.Rubio even said we have a right to protect the border. This was nonsense. The Vatican is 100% enclosed with a massive border. </comment>

<comment>The Vatican is also very easy to get into, so, not the same thing at all.</comment>

<comment>She just copied and pasted a tweet.</comment>

<comment>She does that sometimes.</comment>

<comment>He's a clown. I used to like the guy. He's a judgey prick, who lives behind a Great Wall while talking down about someone who wants the same protection he enjoys. </comment>

<comment>Yes this Pope seems to be acting too big for britches in a way. After the big weeklong pomp & circumstance  speeches & ceremony display here last year, I longed for the less visible Pope. I respect the position though. </comment>

<comment>See I would love to respect it. But the rcc has enabled Child molestation for years and years. This pope would rather be a hypocrite and a non Christian (by his own standards) than make a concentrated effort on fixing the culture that leads to child molestation in the church. </comment>

<comment>True. What should they do- castrate all priests. It really was rampant & so disgusting that they swept it under the rug. </comment>

<comment>You're absolutely right. About all of it </comment>

<comment>Allow priests to marry and the problem largely goes away.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump is a pathetic joke.The Republican party deserves to get F'd up by the Trump Clown for allowing this farce to continue past the moment Trump lost the Hispanic / Latino voting demographic for the Republican party.Republicans have no principles.The party of Lincoln and Reagan is dead. </comment>

<comment>And yet you can't say why Latinos won't vote for me. You can't say why  I'm a joke. The eGOP has no principle. Me and my constituents do. You'll respond with some incoherent rambling though. </comment>

<comment>"Ideas" like "Mexico will pay for a wall" is why Trump is a joke. He also wants to repeal Obamacare, and replace it with something beautiful. Wtf is that? He will order Apple and other companies to onshore. How? He will make Apple violate the Fourth Amendment. How?</comment>

<comment>Still pathetic and pretending to be classless Trump on a message board, huh?Whatever trolling helps you feel better about your apparent inadequacy. </comment>

<comment>^there it is. You're a Marco Rubio fan huh? Repeating the same nonsensical jibber jabber. And you'll respond with nothing again. Because you don't have an actual argument. </comment>

<comment>The Catholic Church has been in a prolonged downfall for decades and one of its remaining strongholds of followers is made up of the hispanic countries of the Americas. The mostly Catholic populations of these countries are major donors to the church, especially the drug cartel bosses who repeatedly try to buy their forgiveness from the church for the many people they kill in their own countries and in ours. The Pope has to do whatever he can to keep the people of Mexico in a giving mood and the government of that country knows this. When we build a wall and stop the free flow of money into the Mexican economy from illegals working in this country or from the sale of drugs smuggled into this country, the church will suffer because its donors will suffer. This means the Pope has to be against the wall even though he lives behind one of the biggest walls in the world. People argue that the Pope was only speaking metaphorically and was not talking about an actual physical wall, but if that is the case then why is Mr. Trump being chastised for wanting to build an actual wall. A wall that he himself has said will not stop the flow of legal immigrants and that is described as having a large door for people to enter the country through as long as they enter legally. Mr. Trump is not calling for an all white America, but a safe and secure America and we the citizens of this country deserve that.If the Pope really wants to help the people of Mexico he should tell them to stop running from their problems and join together to fix their own country and government. We are going to build a wall to keep ours secure.</comment>

<comment>Sick.</comment>

<comment>Why? Please elaborate.</comment>

<comment>At least one decent man of faith has now spoken out against Trump's hypocrisy and demagoguery.  More should do the same and not allow Trump to continue to preach hate and bigotry without consequence.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, isn't that strange how many of the same folks who have no problem with Trump's "un-PC", "tell-it-like-it-is" ("coming out of his wherever")… suddenly have a conniption fit when he's scolded by a man of the cloth (and the spiritual leader of over a billion souls)?!</comment>

<comment>The pope being a hypocrite is fascinating. I agree</comment>

<comment>I've said before on Atlantic threads that Trump is prepared to attack anyone who gets in his way or under his thin skin. If he will attack the Prior and the Catholic Church, he will attack Hindus and Jews just as easily. He is NOT as some have suggested a  "pathetic joke." </comment>

<comment>That is the epitome of a pathetic joke. </comment>

<comment>I'm very sorry that you find it funny. Trump stopped being funny a while ago. A loose cannon no longer shooting blanks.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say he is a funny joke, pathetic joke is the charge.</comment>

<comment>Says the dude with the clown face avatar.</comment>

<comment>What are we arguing about?</comment>

<comment>Damned if I know. I'm usually upvoting your comments.</comment>

<comment>Beats me. I'm usually upvoting your posts.</comment>

<comment>He's a pathetic joke unless he gets elected.  At that point he's a monster.</comment>

<comment>He's the most Common Sense Conservative running! We need the most assertive businessman now more than ever. Trump's ego will not allow him to lose or allow the country to lose. His energy and leadership skills are out the roof!</comment>

<comment>How did Trump attack the Pope? He was asked his opinion of the Pope's visit and gave two non insulting and non disparaging answers. The Pope actually agreed with Trump's first statement that he, the Pope is a political man. Later when asked about Trump, the Pope made it clear that he did not know what Trump had actually said, saying "if that is what the man said, he is no Christian"The Pope attacked Trump without even meeting with the man or knowing what he said, thus proving Trump's second statement that the Pope was acting without the knowledge of what was going on.</comment>

<comment>Nice to see all of the rats on the left run to the defense of the pope they haven't ever cared about before.Trump 2016 </comment>

<comment>I wonder if the average Trump supporter has any idea how Trump is perceived outside the USA.At first, many thought it was a joke and wasn't real.As we realised that this is real and some people in the USA are actually serious about this man we were horrified.  Britain wants to ban his entry.  On the Canadian news, he is routinely mocked, likewise in Australia.  Now even the Catholic church feels the need to try to intervene before this nightmare actually happens.We wish you would all wake up and realise what kind of man he is.</comment>

<comment>Australia has a Jedi religion. Canada has "dude weed" as prime minister and the United Kingdom is a Muslim country. Forgive me if I don't give a damn at all what you all think. </comment>

<comment>Right up until the point when you want to build a coalition to attack another country, then you care.Your closest friends are trying to tell you you're about to make a HUGE mistake.  Up to you if you care to listen.</comment>

<comment>With friends like England and Canada and Australia, who needs enemies? </comment>

<comment>We wish you well with your new buddy Putin.Apparently in Russia it's well known that when Putin speaks highly of Trump he's talking 'tongue in cheek'.  They can't believe how stupid Trump and his supporters are that they're taking it literally.</comment>

<comment>He's a better man than Trudeau. </comment>

<comment>Chill it, Don. They put in their time in Afghanistan and Iraq.</comment>

<comment>And they were wrong to do that, just as we were. I can't even thank them.I can only say: I'm sorry you were duped, and that Tony Blair is a scumbag,(I don't know Australia or Canada's excuse for any of their participation)</comment>

<comment>Trump is mocked in America too.Don't worry about it. Trump is only going to draw 30% of voting Republicans or less.Once the Primary race gets narrowed down to Trump and one other candidate, Trump will lose big time.Either that, or the Establishment GOP will rig the Republican Convention to rid themselves of the classless fool.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I can easily imagine that happening.</comment>

<comment>Count on it. The Establishment GOP doesn't want to go half a decade listening to the classless moron Trump blame them for his failures. </comment>
