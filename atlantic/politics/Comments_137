<comment>"[I]t per­sists mostly be­cause the coun­try is now di­vided al­most evenly . . . the party that wins the White House still will al­most cer­tainly need to forge reas­on­able com­prom­ises with the los­ing side . . ."Political compromise is much easier to achieve when it is not burdened with the personal.  The past few years have made it clear that with heated rhetoric aimed at individuals, as opposed to ideas, politicians paint themselves into corners with voters that make compromise increasingly less palatable.  The end of Boehner's career seems to help illustrate this notion.Sadly, we're looking at a few popular candidates who are personally divisive.  For many, there are no grey areas with Trump, Cruz, or Clinton.  They're either respected or reviled - but, rarely both.</comment>

<comment>Oddly enough, while in the Senate, Hilary Clinton was a very successful collaborator and was well-respected by her colleagues there. She attended conservative prayer sessions, etc. Anyone who actually wants something to get done should pick Clinton. Maybe Sanders, Kasich, or, if you must, Rubio. They, at least, know what needs to be done to do real work.</comment>

<comment>You're looking at the wrong side of the inquiry.  This isn't about whether Clinton or Trump are willing to cut deals, but rather whether others can get to a position where they'll be able to cut deals with them.  The Obama lesson is that Presidents can be more willing to come to the table than his or her opponents.Trump and Cruz may actually face more difficulty than Obama, considering that they will have to negotiate routinely with members of their own party.</comment>

<comment>Part of the problem is that the GOP, in particular, has no new ideas. They're still the party of unfunded wars, lower taxes on rich people, less corporate regulation, higher defense spending, and building a border fence so that they can turn the country into a whites-only Christian theocracy.And the scary part is that they are so enveloped in the Fox News bubble that most of them don't see the irony in (for example) proposing to cut taxes and balance the budget, all while sending ground troops to Syria and invading Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Everything you said applies to hillary also.</comment>

<comment>Which is why I am supporting Bernie....</comment>

<comment>Believing in compromise is no longer bipartisan. Ronnie needs to catch up.</comment>

<comment>You like NR are a mouthpiece for the Status Quo</comment>

<comment>A common refrain from conservatives has been that Romney lost in 2012 and McCain lost in 2008 because they were not conservative enough. I'd like a list of the moderate positions either of those men campaigned for President on. I can't remember anything other than hard right from candidates when they were running. </comment>

<comment>Don't see any gridlock on the Dems side. They only have two candidates in Bernie and Hillary as Martin won't be going anywhere. Easy to choose from just two people. On the GOP side it's like Barnum and Bailey circus. All the clowns under the big top vying to become the ring master. Trump is that at that moment because he has the biggest mouth as empty barrels always make the most noise. GOP are recycling the same old policies from the dinosaur age as they don't seem to have progressed much beyond that period. What part of wash rinse repeat policies that the people rejected not only once but twice don't they get? They must think we have forgotten the mess they got us into and they expect the voting public to fall for that again. They must be smoking something and it isn't a regular cigarette.</comment>

<comment>'Trump seems genu­inely con­vinced he could ne­go­ti­ate with con­gres­sion­al Demo­crats if elec­ted. “That’s the way the coun­try is sup­posed to work,” he in­sisted in Mar­shall­town this week.'The way this was written makes it sound as though the author doesn't actually believe this, but yet its true. Maybe Trump is taking the most extreme position so when he actually negotiates, he gets a lot of what he (and conservatives) want. This is actually how haggling and negotiating works, you never start out with your actual demands, you go in at the extreme and come back to the middle (or the centre right, Trump would hope).We unfortunately see this today because politicians are expected by the media to take definitive positions on all issues and are then pilloried when forced to negotiate down with the other side, but it is how the system was designed to work, so that most issues had at least some different ideas and perspectives brought to bear, as opposed to one person's (the Monarch) or one party's (as could often happen in parliamentary systems) views imposed on all fronts. Thank 24/7 wall to wall media coverage for that.</comment>
