<comment>Drone pilots can never be heroes. If you're gonna kill someone, you owe it to them to do it in person. </comment>

<comment>So that means a pilot of any sort can never be a hero. Nor can some in artillery or on a ship. Only standing eye ball to eye ball.</comment>

<comment>Where did I say any of that?You are going off on a tangent. Have fun with that.</comment>

<comment>I am a Soldier and to my kowledge I have killed 43 people either directly with my personal weapon or indirectly using artillery or air strikes. Brightlight made a smart alec comment, but it's still a valid point. I was there in person, but sometimes the operator's of the strike platform were not. It didn't really matter to me whether the operator was physically flying overhead or in a trailer on Nevada, as long as I got the support I needed.</comment>

<comment>Right, and are they not using their training, instincts, wits, and experience to do their best to hit the enemy and not you? Might not be "heroic" in the traditional sense but I'd rather have competence than heroism on my side any day.</comment>

<comment>You have my deepest sympathies.  It's sad anytime someone has to participate in the lowest of all human behaviors. </comment>

<comment>Why do you capitalize "soldier"? Do you think you're God, just because you killed 43 people for a paycheck?What a joke. You're nothing more than a corporate hit man. Liquidating the locals, so that new markets can be "opened".</comment>

<comment>I capitalized soldier just because I'm so used to some really weird Army specific grammar rules, nothing more sinister than that.The only people that I ever killed were people that were trying to kill me. The reason they were trying to kill me was because I was trying to stop a whole lot of Sunni Muslims from ethnicly cleansing a smaller population of Shia Muslims. The Sunni extremists also had a problem with me building water filtration systems, electricity generation grids, and schools for girls in places where they previously had no opportunity for an education.It seems like you have problems with the overall foreign policy of the US, and that's definitely a topic worthy of debate. But if you really want to demonstrate your intellectual prowess, I invite you to engage with me on an individual level rather than making generalized comments about my actions or intent. If you would rather discuss the strategic implications of how the US formulates it's ends, ways, and means, that is fine also.</comment>

<comment>Some one on a ship who doesn't come under fire cannot be a hero.  That's correct.  They can be competent and resourceful, and highly valuable to those who are in harm's way.  They needn't ever feel ashamed for being good at their job.But if you're not faced with personal danger then whatever you do, however well you do it, is not "heroic."</comment>

<comment>That is a stupid comment. A war is meant to inflict as much violence on the enemy as needed in order to get them to either surrender or give up offensive actions. It doesn't matter how that violence is inflicted.</comment>

<comment>Without personal risk, there is no heroism.  That's what it means to be a hero:  to display courage and to face your own mortality in order to save others.  Even if the mode of "saving" yours actually requires you to kill lots of the other guy's, you can be a hero.Drone pilots experience more personal risk driving to work in the morning than they do actually performing their work, so no, they aren't heroes.</comment>

<comment>Thank you</comment>

<comment>How about a surgeon who performs life-saving operations--can they ever be called a hero? How about the doctors who, as a missionary service, travel to third-world venues and use their medical skills, at great personal sacrifice, to save lives--any of them heroes? The teacher in the inner city who passed up other, easier classrooms to teach and work with kids in that environment--hero?If we want to define a hero as someone who risks their life in performance of their tasks, I’m fine with that. But it’ll also require a redefinition of how the word is used in contemporary society.</comment>

<comment>None of those are heroes in the military sense of the word.If you want to define "hero" as some one who does great deeds, or some one who acts selflessly and saves lives, that's fine.  But it's just not how the word is used in a military context, at least not without an element of real danger. Doing your job, even at considerable inconvenience, is simply par for the course in the military.  It's the minimum standard.</comment>

<comment>The origin of "hero" is Greek, and it had nothing to do with saving lives.  </comment>

<comment>It has to include some kind of personal risk.  The first one I'd say is just doing their job that they're probably paid pretty well for.  They're great at it, and they save people, but hero doesn't fit.  Maybe just awesome surgeon?  The second one I'd say maybe; if this is MSF in Afghanistan, then yes.  The third one no, and it's arguably not cool to suggest as much if your assumption is that their safety is at risk just because they're working with inner city kids.  I wouldn't call every Teach for America friend I've ever had a hero.</comment>

<comment>I wasn’t trying to imply the teacher was at physical risk: I was trying to set up a situation where someone had strapped on a hard, socially good job when they could easily find something easier to do that was roughly equivalent. I have a relative who’s doing exactly that--teaching in the inner city (high school math) when he has many other options--because he believes the kids he teaches will benefit more from his skills than kids in the rich suburban districts. It’s not a case of physical danger--it’s taking a lower salary for a harder job environment than he has to.</comment>

<comment>People who do good things that are personally inconvenient are *saints*, not *heroes*.</comment>

<comment>Look at this guy, comparing doctors performing surgery in the third world for free to paid killers gunning down naked foreigners so that Exxon can get the next round of no-bid contracts!</comment>

<comment>My comment was in reference to the second part of his post</comment>

<comment>When there's a squad of American soldiers on the side of a hill in Afghanistan, and they're getting mortars lobbed down on them by some frisky Talibs, and a U.S. drone comes along and blows up the guys with the mortars - that pilot is a hero all day long to those soldiers. Is he just doing his job from some trailer in Nevada? Yep. Does that matter? Nope. </comment>

<comment>You're right. Drone pilots are not heroes. They're murderers.Mercenaries, at their best.</comment>

<comment>Riiight, same for pilots... and artillery folks... and snipers...</comment>

<comment>The word "hero" has been totally changed and denigrated.  EVERYONE is a hero these days, just for doing their job, for dying young, having a difficult time or numerous other relatively routine things.  The actual definition of the word has been lost...</comment>

<comment>At the beginning of the New WorldOrder fraud called the “war on 'terror'”, just after the NewWorld Order engineered fraud called September 11, sentiments such asthose expressed here were considered anti American.  In war, itwasn't Americans' duty to act honorably, just to kill as many Muslimsas possible.  Attrition was a goal.  The American military snipetactic called the “kill box”, where a piece of equipment withAmerican markings was put out as bait, an attempt at entrapment, and,if anyone, man, woman or child, picked it up, that was “assumed”automatically to make them a “terrorist” who wanted to use itagainst Americans, and so made them fair game to be murdered. Satellites, air support, body armor, night vision goggles, instantcommunications, high powered weaponry against individuals who wereeither sandaled or barefoot, wearing little more than a robe andcarrying single shot rifles.  The “war on 'terror'” was arepudiation of the meaning of honor from the start.  In the spirit ofin for a dime, in for a dollar, since the “war on 'terror'” wasintended to be fought malignantly from the start, equally craventechniques like naming all the  thieves, baby killers and childrapists and murderers “heroes”.  And the technique of craveninstitutions saying, “Don't pray for the soldiers to kill as manyMuslims as possible.  Pray only that they come home safely!”  But,since they were shooting at people likely to shoot back, “cominghome safely” could be considered as equivalent to “killing asmany Muslims as possible”.     Incidentally, the craven use ofthe term “contractors”.  The gullible, in the beginning, thoughtthese were little more than electricians or house painters.  Evenhere, the exact meaning is not made clear.  Many if not most or allexoneratingly named “contractors” were paid-for-hire killers,mercenaries, who would not be bound by rules of war!</comment>

<comment>If you're going to cut & paste please clean up the paragraphs first. TY</comment>

<comment>Sure, a drone pilot can be a hero.If the building he is in is burning down, and he braves the smoke and flames in order to pull a fellow drone pilot from almost certain death, at considerable personal risk, then he is a hero.If he's sitting comfortably in a chair, experiencing less risk than a taxi cab driver, then I don't care how fine a drone pilot he is, he cannot be a hero.  Not in the sense that it is traditionally defined in the military.</comment>

<comment>I thought they'd be analogous to an artillery command. Maybe if they fire a drone that results in blowing up an enemy convoy, they could be a hero.</comment>

<comment>Name one artillery commander who could be considered a "hero".Cowards who kill from a distance are never heroes and never will be.</comment>

<comment>I take it you fight with a sword and shield, then?</comment>

<comment>Thomas Jackson during the Mexican-American War.  Maybe Napoleon in his younger days.'Course, artillery was a direct fire weapon then.</comment>

<comment>Still, it had a much greater range than anything a front-line infantryman could carry. That's a part of military genius of Napoleon - he has figured out how to put that range to an efficient use.</comment>

<comment>The word HERO has been meaningless since 2002ish.</comment>

<comment>The word hero has been bantered about, misused, abused and subjected to such minimalism that it has become a worthless characterization of human action. Perhaps it is time for folks to revisit some historical writings and recordings of actual heroic behavior rather than making it another example of the contemporary T-ball mentality.</comment>

<comment>My wife's a hero. She kept herself and her four daughters sane, fed, clothed, educated, and healthy despite her ex-husband routinely beating the shit out of her for years while her family, neighbors, church, and justice system looked the other way. That definition of heroism is good enough for me (and far superior to the usual romantic macho gun-slinging crap).</comment>

<comment>No.</comment>

<comment>As long as they are men</comment>

<comment>Once we started handing out "Medals of Frredom" to musicians, baseball players, senators, etc. the whole concept of heroism has kind of gone out the window. We don't need more medals; we need less. Giving Warren Buffet and Barbra Streisand Medals of Freedom was just the President giving some supporters a tongue bath.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but civilian awards are about contributions to society and culture, not heroism. You don't need to be a hero to make a positive impact on society. You don't even need to be well liked. Besides, there's no rule that says we can't recognize work that isn't heroic. </comment>

<comment>This is operating under the assumption that all military are "heroes."  That's faulty logic to me.  I'm not suggesting that there's anything inherently wrong with serving in the military.  I am simply of the opinion that it's a false narrative that soldiers are out "protecting our freedoms" and should be "thanked for their service."  Again, it's not an insult to those who chose to join, I'm only pointing out that invading and occupying foreign countries doesn't do anything to "protect our freedoms."  Also, military members are compensated for their work, so I'm not sure why we're supposed to thank them constantly.  They are provided food, clothing, shelter, transportation, healthcare, education and retirement benefits all on top of earning a salary, which is considerably more than most employers provide. So, no I don't think drone pilots are "heroes" any more than those who patrol foreign lands with automatic rifles and other weapons are "heroes."  I also don't think athletes or movie stars are "heroes" even though that term is often tossed about.  To me, a hero is someone who goes above and beyond to help another person at great risk to themselves.  Military members are doing their jobs.  There's nothing automatically heroic in that.</comment>

<comment>Invading and occupying nations which would do us harm is the very definition of "protecting our freedoms".</comment>

<comment>Well, when those soldiers signed up to serve, they most definitely had no idea which countries exactly they are going to be in... or when or why. The very idea of putting themselves in harm's way for others without actually having any data about the future - that's pretty heroic to me.</comment>

<comment>We've heard that spiel for years now, but it doesn't in any way explain how occupying any country "protects our freedom" or serves anyone but those with financial interests in the region.  Again,  choosing to work in the military is no more inherently heroic than pursuing any other profession.</comment>

<comment>> We've heard that spiel for years now, but it doesn't in any way explain how occupying any country "protects our freedom" or serves anyone but those with financial interests in the region.True - but that's hardly any particular soldier's fault. Don't forget, Pentagon doesn't actually have the power to declare any war. It just fights what our lawmakers and Commander-in-Chief tell it to right.>  Again,  choosing to work in the military is no more inherently heroic than pursuing any other profession.I don't know any other careers potentially as hazardous for one's health. Truckers, or engineers, or doctors don't routinely deal with people who want nothing more than their death.</comment>

<comment>You'll notice I didn't blame any wars on soldiers. If you think the Pentagon is not actively involved in going to war, then you're incredibly naive.Choosing a profession that is likely to maim or kill you,  and for likely no good reason, is not heroic.  Choosing to put yourself at risk to actually help people is absolutely honorable.  Examples would be Doctors Without Borders, firefighters,  most police officers, the Secret Service etc.</comment>

<comment>The very notion that someone can be a "hero" for killing people - who have no possibility to defend themselves against him - from a position of total safety is not just ridiculous, it is offensive. But then of course in the US the term "hero" is just as political as the term "coward", i.e. a form of Newspeak which means the opposite of what the dictionary would suggest. The 9/11 attackers for instance were "cowards" according to G.W. Bush. You can call them many things: criminals, delusional fanatics, sociopaths, whatever. But cowards they were most certainly not.</comment>

<comment>"How will martial honor be defined in the future?"Probably by height.</comment>

<comment>Drone pilots are almost certainly experiencing something distinct from PTSD that has never been seen before.  They spend up to 12 hours intimately watching their target's every move as well as those of the innocent bystanders around them.  They get a glimpse into all these people's routine day to day lives. Then they are suddenly told to pull the trigger and obliterate them all.  The turnover rate among drone pilots is so high because most of them realize the psychological strain of doing this is even higher than being shot at.</comment>

<comment>Y'all are arguing about whether or not the circumstances of killing somebody make someone a hero. In the end, they're all murderers.</comment>

<comment>Sure, just get the highest score</comment>

<comment>As an Infantry veteran, he'll no. The are just PoGs playing xbox. </comment>

<comment>In regards to the stress of drone piloting, if killing people is making you feel sick, perhaps you should stop killing people?</comment>

<comment>Ugh, so sick of hero porn.</comment>

<comment>For reading on this topic, I suggest "Killing Without Honor", by Shane Riza, a retired F-16 pilot. He has written a whole book dedicated to the moral aspects of drone warfare. Personally, I think when you parcel out risk from any definition of "heroic", it looses any meaning. Drone pilots - when controlling aircraft in a trailer in north Las Vegas, do not risk their lives. The most risk to life they face will likely be their drive to work.</comment>

<comment>Courage, bravery, valor, requires the conquering of fear of physical bodily harm and/or death, plain and simple. It is the acting through that fear, the refusal to flight or freeze as a natural animal instinct, that makes the act courageous. Arguing anything else is simply "feel good" analysis of one's actions. However, that is not to say that actions on behalf of a larger noble cause are not commendable, but they are not heroic as courage in the battlefield; specially since anyone can argue any action they take to be in furthering a noble, righteous cause. From showing up to work on time (the greater cause of contributing to the national GDP), to even in Hitler's mind all his actions were for a greater cause, but I doubt a reasonable person would concur that either example is heroic.</comment>

<comment>There are a lot of people in the military do essential jobs out of harms way and do those jobs well.  They don't get to call themselves heroes. </comment>
