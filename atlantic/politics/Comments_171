<comment>I'm surprised the author didn't mention the scene in "The American President" in which the President tells his aide "Schedule more meetings in which people give me a very large fish."  (Okay, that was a gift from someone in Wisconsin, but it's the thought that counts.)I remember seeing Eisenhower's home in Gettysburg, and it was jammed with all sorts of things people had given him.</comment>

<comment>I imagine one perk of being president is that you don't have to write your own thank you cards.</comment>

<comment>I hope we reciprocated with something equally as cool and American like a genuine M4 carbine.</comment>

<comment>Maybe something with a more equivalent level of power, like a fancy custom-made cavalry saber or a Bowie knife with a silver and turquoise-worked elk antler grip. (At first i was going to joke around along with you, but then I just thought "actually, we could do some really cool stuff with bladed weapons!" and decided to roll with it unironically instead.)</comment>

<comment>Really fascinating stuff. Every Presidential library I've ever visited has had several of these sorts of things. Some of them make you go, "hmmm". I'm going to be watching to see if I see Hillary Clinton wearing the necklace from Myanmar.</comment>

<comment>Not sure, but I'm pretty sure the best gift a President has ever received was what JFK got from Marilyn Monroe.</comment>

<comment>The gift of the clap? It's the gift that keeps on giving.</comment>

<comment>Heck, I could sing "Happy Birthday" to President Obama right now! I don't see what's so special about it.</comment>

<comment>I'll be sure to check on the state of that huge mound of raw Argentinian lamb meat if I ever get the chance to visit the Archives.</comment>

<comment>Worst gift from a US President?  A lapful of warm vomit from George HW Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister.  http://abcnews.go.com/Archives...</comment>

<comment>That just goes to show that it's much better to plan your gifts ahead of time than it is to come up with something on the spot.</comment>

<comment>What Obama's gifts to the American people?  20 trillion deficit, chaos in the Middle East, Obamacare, worst economy since the 1970s.....</comment>

<comment>“But not to worry,” continued Mr. Obama, who, though garbed only in a robe of sheer white fabric, was dual-wielding a 20-inch steel sword and Algerian dagger, encrusted in gemstones and with coral stones and silver work, respectively. “I have crocodile insurance."</comment>

<comment>I increasingly dont care for obo,but his best two attributes were that he didn't start anymore wars and he married a Black woman.</comment>

<comment>He started wars in Syria, Yemen, Libya and Iraq</comment>

<comment>All four of those were already ongoing before Obama's involvement, and the last was Dubya's gift to the world.</comment>

<comment>According to Jeremy Clarkson, Queen Elizabeth presented President Obama with a pen holder carved from the timbers of an anti-slave patrol ship. We presented her with a copy of The Graduate on DVD. Hehe.</comment>

<comment>Did that really happen?Please tell me that was creative fiction.I would believe it.</comment>

<comment>http://www.nydailynews.com/new...Apparently it was then-Prime Minister Gordon and it wasn't just a copy of The Graduate, it was 25 "classic" American movies. The other stuff is true, though.</comment>

<comment>This is a good one."White visiting the Queen, the Obama family gave her an iPod, prompting raised eyebrows from the British Press. The MP3 player came pre-loaded with photos from President Obama’s inauguration and audio files of the president’s speech as a senator to the 2004 Democratic National Convention and his 2009 inauguration address."</comment>

<comment>Obama gets lots of gifts from Islamic Muslim terrorists</comment>

<comment>Look at Moo Moo Shell .... what a drip</comment>

<comment>You offend me.</comment>

<comment>White House gifts always make me think of the Jackson cheese, a 1400 pound (!) cheese given by Sandy Creek, NY to the president.  Before refrigeration.  And it lasted for over 2 years (!).  Jackson abandoned it after his term expired so that the next occupant would have to deal with it.  They evidently had to redo the entire room in which it was stored because of the stink.Article:http://mentalfloss.com/article...History Podcast:http://thedollop.libsyn.com/th...</comment>

<comment>That made me surrender my lunch.</comment>
