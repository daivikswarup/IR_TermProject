<comment>Sorry, Conor, but my first amendment rights are not subject to any negotiations and they are not up for debate either.  There is no dialog to be had here.  You are giving air time to a troll here and in some ways this is more of a betrayal of free speech than a defense.</comment>

<comment>On principle, I agree with you. However, consider this - the very issue that Conor is debating is showing people that saying "there's no debate" is smallminded and ignorant. As much is it should be obvious, saying "there's no debate" or "no negotiations" is to stoop to their level, rather then leading by example with persuasive, intellectual discourse. For the record, I don't think Conor's words here showed any inclination to compromise, but challenged assumptions and attempted to open eyes to how morally and Constitutionally wrong their positions and actions have been.</comment>

<comment>The traditional legal controversies about free speech all relate to either public safety or what I will call tortious damages.  The latter is pretty simple ---- if someone harms someone else with words, then the state can step in and force the guilty party to compensate the other. The state is just saying you must own up to your words, you are not a criminal for this.  Not much controversy there.   The former relates to public safety.  Shouting "fire" in a public theater when there really is no fire is an act that is not really an expression of an idea.  Therefore the state is not discouraging any idea here from being disseminated --- if there really is a fire in the theater, then you are duty bound to shout "fire".   Conor is indulging someone who clearly is promoting an infringement to the notion of a free marketplace of ideas.  This is not the kind of debate which should be given legitimacy.</comment>

<comment>Again, on principle I agree. But how does shutting down and saying "I'm right, you're wrong, so shut up and stop infringing my freedom" make them recognize how arrogantly wrong they are? These people have no ground whatsoever to stand on in how they attempt to censor others. I guess in my estimation that using logic and the Constitution to absolutely rip them to shreds on the topic has more a chance of opening their eyes than "not indulging" them. Only one of those has even a prayer of showing them their severe error. Ultimately more people who respect the First is the goal, right?</comment>

<comment>I do not believe that Jelani Cobb has any love for the first amendment.  I cannot believe, in all seriousness, that he is allowed to blog these views for the New Yorker, which is a truly great liberal magazine which I will swear by.   These are simply anti-American values being promoted and we should not give them an airing like this.  The same way I would not support the Atlantic promoting a Holocaust denier in this manner.  I am all for debates and such in the comments section, I am not suggesting censorship.  Cobb is a crackpot.</comment>

<comment>"not up for debate". In other words, Deus objects to certain free speech rights.</comment>

<comment>No, Deus objects to giving every idea credence.  People are free to talk about whatever they like, but we are under no compunction to actually engage bad ideas.</comment>

<comment>"People are free to talk about whatever they like"Then why are we on our 4th Fridersdorf article complaining mostly about students voicing their opinions, and why is he framing it as if they're assaulting somebody's free speech rights by using their own?</comment>

<comment>Because these students "Voicing their opinion" are getting administrators to enforce their will.  So he is partaking in the process of engaging a bad idea in the hopes of preventing that from happening.These students are demanding the people with power enforce their bad ideas.  Should Conor and people who object to these bad ideas not engage them?</comment>

<comment>"So he is partaking in the process of engaging a bad idea in the hopes of preventing that from happening."Yes, he is. I'll give him that.But he's also painting them as criminals and anti-Constitutionalists to do so. There's a better argument than that, and I think he could have cut all the chaff out and made a much better point instead of simply attacking those who use their free speech rights to get what they want at the school they pay tuition for.I just don't understand why anybody acts like these kids shouldn't have a place in the marketplace of ideas.</comment>

<comment>"Nevertheless, the Afrikan Student Union declared that the party was cultural appropriation. So far, there’s no First Amendment issue. The Afrikan Student Union had every right to protest something it found offensive. If I’d seen the party, maybe I’d agree with them."</comment>

<comment>"So far"So he's saying later that a group of individuals somehow violated somebody's First Amendment rights? How is that possible?That's what I take issue with.</comment>

<comment>Because that is precisely what the Afrikan Student Union did in collaboration with the weak kneed PC school administrators - at a taxpayer supported public university. And when turn about is fair play, the same ASU will scream bloody murder... at the very same school administrators.</comment>

<comment>They should.  But once you start using FORCE to get your way in the marketplace of ideas, it's not a marketplace anymore.  That's what free speech advocates object to: the student activists who are demanding top-down ENFORCEMENT of their ideas.</comment>

<comment>No, but it's good for you and builds character, and how else will people learn to recognize bad ideas unless someone persuades them of why the ideas are bad?Jonathan Rauch said it best: when we are deciding who is right on any given issue, there is no final say and there are no special authorities.  The discussion isn't over just because someone involved is tired of it.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, look, the First Amendment and the Constitution ironically come with a self-destruct mechanism in that the law reflects the will of the people and there's a process to change them.  If the ability to say anything unimpeded by law is to mean anything, that has to include the right to call for a curbing of speech.  May it never come to pass, of course.</comment>

<comment>"You are giving air time to a troll here and in some ways this is more of a betrayal of free speech"I'm with Conor's position 100%, but this is silly. The new face of censorship is a serious movement which is attracting followers, largely at the upper income level (i.e. the people most likely to become our elites). If open discourse is the way to win things, then you win this argument with open discourse too.I think any consistently free speech position will acknowledge that free speech itself is going to be part of the conversation - and that it wins easily, and is worth defending forcefully.</comment>

<comment>I'm skeptical that these campus protesters have the life skills to become future 'elites'. Spitting on others, yelling obscenities, bursting into tears and bullying aren't conducive to success in the real world. Then again, maybe campuses will in the future create bureaucratic jobs that prosecute acts of microaggression, insensitivity, cultural appropriation etc. Students that don't self-segregate themselves into victim/marginalized groups could be investigated and fined for said transgressions.</comment>

<comment>College students can be dumb (source: common sense; was a college student at one point). I suspect a lot of the silliness like this won't penetrate far beyond the campus administration - even if that is a serious concern in and of itself - but the main source of this kind of activism has been Ivy Leagues/private liberal arts colleges, both of which cater primarily to the upper echelons of society.So yeah, that part does concern me.</comment>

<comment>I think they're mirroring society at large. The tenet of the 21st Century has been, "If you aren't constantly pushing your own agenda, then someone else will push their own right over you."If you aren't constantly pursuing wealth and using the system to maintain it, someone else will push an agenda to take more via higher taxes and closed tax breaks.If you aren't constantly pushing for preserving police officers' rights, then anti-police organizations will strip them.If you don't push for increased rights and opportunities for minorities and historically-oppressed peoples, then their rights and the opportunities available will be slowly stripped away.The unfortunate reality is that, if you're winning, you sometimes turn into the devil you were fighting in the interest of not losing ground.</comment>

<comment>How about that? Very first comment and it embodies a perfect illustration of the author's point.</comment>

<comment>Cobb wants to change the first amendment to deny me my rights.  I am merely saying ignore Cobb.  How is this on a par?</comment>

<comment>Who the hell is Cobb? You criticized Conor because there's no dialog to be had. If that's true for you, then you proved Conor's point.</comment>

<comment>Who is Cobb?  So, you did not even read the article?  No wonder you are clueless about what my comment means.</comment>

<comment>Your comment didn't refer to Cobb. Your comment referred to Friedersdorf.  Please say what you mean and then people will understand what you mean.</comment>

<comment>This is at least Conor's 4th piece whining about college kids using their free speech rights and their financial position at the school to effect the change they want. What he actually disagrees with is 'the change they want'. He just tries to paint it as a free speech issue in the same way conservatives sling around "PC" with free speech issues attached.Both are bulls***.</comment>

<comment>> What he actually disagrees with is 'the change they want'.Well yes, that's obvious and he's not trying to somehow hide it.  The problem is 'the change they want' includes excessive limits on people's first amendment rights.  He has given numerous examples of these limits they are demanding and why he has problems with them.  This isn't hand waving "PC BAD", these are concrete examples.I'm not sure how using their first amendment rights and financial position to affect this change in anyway makes it right.  If a bunch of rich and vocal people used their financial position and first amendment rights to try and keep muslim citizens from re-entering the country, it would still be wrong.</comment>

<comment>"I'm not sure how using their first amendment rights and financial position to affect this change in anyway makes it right."It doesn't have to make it right. I don't even agree with them. All it has to do is be FREE SPEECH, which, it is. Calling for something is not the same as doing something, and Conor has focused specifically on students for 4 essays now. His obsession with silencing these students is the same exact thing these kids are doing to their professors.... attempting to influence them. Why he attaches a 1st Amendment argument to this is simply because it sells.He literally said, in this one, "Some students.... are violating the first amendment".How, I ask, is that possible?</comment>

<comment>He said "Some students and administrators..."  And Conor has not called for any sort of action to be taken against these protesters, he has not asked administrators or the legal system to shut them down, or prevent them from gathering.  So he is not "silencing" them, he is attempting to change their minds or simply to tell them "No, you can't have that"</comment>

<comment>He's using deception. He paints these kids as some anti-rights protesters to further his argument against their argument. There's a good enough argument against their argument without having to paint the group as assault suspects or Constitution-shredders. That's all it is. He disagrees with the students, but paints it as an assault on our rights (when, again, it's simply others USING their rights); because when you say our rights are being assaulted, people listen (or, more importantly to the Atlantic, they click.... which also explains why there's 4 of the same article).</comment>

<comment>But the demands they have ARE an assault on our rights.  Obviously their ideas are gaining traction as people who actually hold the levers of power or actually engaging them in their bad ideas and in some cases, putting them into practice.What is the appropriate reaction when administrators do this?  To keep quiet and hope it goes away?  To only talk to the administrators and bypass the people actually making the demands?</comment>

<comment>Demands (the free speech of others) cannot be an assault on your free speech rights. Taking away your right to free speech is an assault on free speech rights. Speaking out against that right is not.</comment>

<comment>No, but those demands can be wrong.But this is how free speech actually works.  Students make wrong headed demands to people in power.  People who disagree engage them and show the people in power that their is an opposing argument.  Conor has not made any demands to curb the free speech of students, he has engaged them and tried to show how they're demands are wrong.It seems you object to actually engaging with the individuals with the bad ideas and instead we should all just plead to the people in power to decide who is right.  That strikes me as a horrible idea.</comment>

<comment>Sure they can be. If the object of your free speech is to encourage censorship by a government entity (such as a public university) then they are assaulting free speech.It's the remedy requested that's the injury to free speech rights. They could protest to other ends--to put social pressure on the fraternity to get them to cancel their party, or to raise public awareness of racism on campus. The current wave of student protests, however, is almost exclusively focused on getting college administrations to silence or punish speech they don't like.</comment>

<comment>I bet there was a lot of whining about the brownshirts using their rights to effect the change they wanted.Some things just never change, eh?</comment>

<comment>Yup, because state university employees telling reporters on public property that they need to "get out" and calling for "muscle" to drive them away ISN'T a First Amendment issue.Nothing to see here, folks.  Move along!  Just government employees taking away your rights to speak and express yourself freely...</comment>

<comment>He's talking about each and every protester, not just the criminal ones...It's telling that you had to set up such a straw man to dispute my point. </comment>

<comment>Here are some actual quotes from Conor’s article:“In today’s activism, as on many prior occasions, I see good, earnest people calling attention to important injustices. Prejudice, bigotry, racial slurs, and harassment are abhorrent, and we all ought to condemn them. Racist mascots ought to be retired. First-generation college students ought to get more support. Legacy admissions preferences that extend the effect of white-supremacist policies into the present day should be abolished. Awareness of these issues and others should be raised. Student activists deserve credit for raising it.”“But I see some of these well-intentioned young people undermining the First Amendment; spitting on people with whom they disagree; using stigma and “call out” culture rather than persuasion against non-bigoted speech; physically intimidating members of the press; bullying students who disagree with them; shredding newspapers because they disagree with an article; and calling for dissent to be punished. They don’t understand why this is both counterproductive and wrongheaded.”“Some students and administrators at public universities are flagrantly violating the First Amendment over costume parties and student journalists photographing protesters.”“There needs to be a process of unending discussion and debate, where wrongheaded ideas are changed by persuasion, not punished by babysitter administrators.”You claim that Conor paints all student protesters as criminals stating, “He’s talking about each and every protester, not just the criminal ones...”.  He does not.  He specifically states that they deserve credit for raising the issues and also calls them “well-intentioned.  He disagrees with some of their methods, (e.g. spitting on other students who disagree, physically intimidating press in a public space, etc.), and he disagrees with some of their goals, (e.g. using the power of the university administration to suppress dissent or speech they consider offensive).  He also states specifically that his complaints are only with “some students”, not “each and every protester” as you claim.  Furthermore, nowhere does he call for the protesters' free speech rights to be curtailed, (unless you consider the ability to threaten reporters with physically assault or spit on other students who disagree with them to be an integral part of the students' "free speech").  They can speak all they want.  He just thinks that some of their actions and demands are "counterproductive and wrongheaded".Interesting that you accuse Will_Z_Macht of setting up a straw man to dispute you when the foundation of you argument against Conor is a huge straw man.</comment>

<comment>"Another mistaken impression is that groups that are minorities in the United States or historically underrepresented on college campuses are alone in being asked to tolerate free speech that offends them."In fact, the First Amendment has protected lampooning a member of the religious right by portraying him as having sex with his drunken mother in an outhouse. It has protected putting a crucifix in a jar of urine. It has protected burning an American flag outside a Veteran’s hospital."His 3 examples are from 1988, 1987, and 1989, respectively.</comment>

<comment>"Some students.... are violating the first amendment"Is that right, Conor? The students are violating the first amendment?</comment>

<comment>"At private colleges, [the students] are trying to target, suppress, or punish speech"In the name of the 1st Amendment, these kids don't have the right to try these three things I deem to be unacceptable speech!-ConorAlso, does anybody question why Conor focuses on assault and other crimes some students might commit in his argument? Might it be that he needs to demonize the students who are strictly using their own free speech rights against the school/professors they disagree with? Violent crime has nothing to do with the rest of the students he's talking about, but he has several paragraphs about the minority of protesters who break the law.</comment>

<comment>"Also, does anybody question why Conor focuses on assault and other crimes some students might commit in his argument?"No need. It's pretty clear."Might it be that he needs to demonize the students who are strictly using their own free speech rights against the school/professors they disagree with?"Almost certainly not, since there was no apparent attempt to do so."Violent crime has nothing to do with the rest of the students he's talking about, but he has several paragraphs about the minority of protesters who break the law."Because those incidents happened and are directly related to the issue of restricting freedom of speech (which they were obvious attempts to accomplish).Granted, they may have been committed by people not otherwise affiliated with the protests who were sent there to make the protesters look bad, which has been a time-tested (and highly-effective) tactic since the 1960's.But the fact that an act such as spitting (on ANYone, which is technically an assault) wasn't immediately condemned and repudiated by the protesters implies support for an action that would have justified reflexively punching the spitter in the face (so as to prevent the issuance of any more bodily fluids -aka "biohazards"- in defense of their position).</comment>

<comment>http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...You know you are making a bed for fascism when you decree that freedoms can only be violated by the government.</comment>

<comment>There's a difference between "freedom" and "constitutional amendment," though. We can, of course, debate the usefulness of free speech until the end of time, and we can similarly debate whether or not we can censor each other or violate each other's freedom of speech. However, what Fred quoted from Conor's piece doesn't address free speech, but the First Amendment in particular. </comment>

<comment>"making a bed for fascism" is speech that should not be tolerated?</comment>

<comment>You have read his four articles apparently. If you aren't interested why do you keep reading them?</comment>

<comment>Well yeah, something like the Mizzou incident with the photographer is violating the First Amendment, correct.There's a heck of a lot more violations of the spirit of free speech all over the place, but that statement as worded holds true.</comment>

<comment>Should I keep trying to read into this? It SOUNDS deep, but I don't see a real meaning in there. Maybe you could elaborate.</comment>

<comment>I'm just asking you to define your terms. Who are the victims you describe? Why are they victims? Who are the perpetrators?</comment>

<comment>It could be anybody really. People will hate other people, for whatever unreasonable reason.</comment>

<comment>Also, "why are they victims" doesn't make me think we're about to go down a non-victim-blaming road, IMO.</comment>

<comment>How about "what are they victims of?" or "If they are victims, what CRIMES have been committed against them?"Victims of bad words?  Oh noes!  Where's my security blanket?</comment>

<comment>The University of Missouri is not "super-elite."</comment>

<comment>I don't often read comments on The Atlantic, but I'm surprised by the current discourse. It seems that people on both sides of the political spectrum are incapable of absorbing either the content or the message.1) Your first amendment rights ARE "up for debate". That doesn't mean they're going to be written out of law.2) It's not whining. It's discussing. One of the most important and characteristic qualities for the United States (and the broader Western World, at that) was it's ability to freely exchange ideas, and to counter -- in the public sphere -- good ones with bad ones.Europe out of the ashes of WWII moved away from this once great value, and has been worse off for it. Unnecessary tax dollars spent enforcing laws that do nothing to curb people's feelings, or ideas, or to make society more safe. It primarily attempted to repress a rise of neo-Nazism, and more than likely had no discernible impact on doing so. Today the greatest antisemitism in Europe comes from its Muslim population who find their inspiration not from Hitler, or Nazism, but from the Quran, Hadith, and geopolitics. Is the solution now, then, to police religion? Just as the solution to antisemitism and Nazism was not to police speech, it isn't to police religion: It's to foster an environment where the free exchange of ideas flourish, where bad ideas can be met, full-force, with good ideas. And vice versa.And that's the purpose of this article: To make it obvious to those who think otherwise, by using the lens of history and the platform of freedom-of-speech itself, that curtailing one's right to speech is a universally bad idea no matter which way you slice it.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't whining in my book until the 3rd article on the same exact subject, for the record. This is now the 4th, I believe.</comment>

<comment>This strain of illiberalism is important and worth fighting in the form of several articles.</comment>

<comment>That's fine, I agree. What I disagree with is the method he's shooting down these kids' argument. He's relating them to the criminals among them. He's painting them as some sort of unAmericans for speaking their minds. If he's simply writing off their ideas as somehow unconstitutional, he's not addressing their concerns. How many people with a financial position in the free market (at the schools themselves) have to speak up about something they don't like before the free market adjusts? At what point is the school imposing YOUR beliefs on the paying students? Should they just pack up and leave if they don't like the school? Would the free market not then provide them with the school they're looking for?How long should they wait for the marketplace of ideas to correct this perceived racism?</comment>

<comment>I don't know what you're talking about. Do you think I'm arguing in favor of racism?</comment>

<comment>If you're the majority, the "shoe" is already on your foot, so to speak.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't whining in my book until the third or fourth protest. But man all those protesters are just so whiny.</comment>

<comment>Using your own free speech rights to oppose somebody else's may not be constructive or right, but it's equally a practice of free speech rights.If you're trying to convince college kids that free speech rights for racists are important, good on you. If you're doing it by literally labeling them as violating our Constitution (that only protects the citizen from the gov't, not the citizen from the citizen), I don't find the argument to be genuine, and haven't for 4 articles now.</comment>

<comment>Hey Fred read the article.  He's speaking of government funded colleges restricting free speech.  That's government restricting free speech.</comment>

<comment>No he's not. Do I need to quote where he said STUDENTS are violating the 1st Amendment?Oh, I already did.</comment>

<comment>But yes he is.  But go ahead and rant on.</comment>

<comment>Well, you're right. I came off track. He makes the right argument in each of his articles on this subject. Thing is, he also makes the wrong one more times than he makes the right one.</comment>

<comment>he said "students and administrators",  I wonder why you keep leaving that part out?</comment>

<comment>Because I agree with the administrators bit, maybe?The school can violate rights. I wonder why he targets students so much throughout his 4 articles (even when he realizes they can't violate 1st Amendment rights, and says it, he still focuses on them for the majority of his series. Why?).</comment>

<comment>Because students are the one's demanding the changes...  Administrators are reacting to THEM...  It's not enough to just send a strongly worded email to the Dean and say you disagree with his policy,  you actually have to engage the people making the demands and hopefully show them the error of their ways.</comment>

<comment>So the SECOND we start talking about the merit of an argument, the first amendment argument flies out the window. The students criticize their teachers (in a first amendment issue, it doesn't matter why). At what point does WHAT they're criticizing them for fall under this stupid 1st Amendment argument? It doesn't, but we've had to hear about these kids assaulting others' right to free speech for 4 columns.</comment>

<comment>They didn't just criticize their teachers, they actually asked for government (at a public university administrators are the government) to enforce their will.  They did this against both teachers and other students.Conor isn't saying the things they are mad about don't exist, what he is saying is their prescribed solutions are bad. And it is these demanded solutions,  the ACTIONS they want taken, that Conor, and myself, are against.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, why would the students care about what you think?They're living in what they consider to be an unhealthy atmosphere (again, this isn't about whether it's unhealthy or not... it's about whether the paying customers feel that it is), and they're paying for it. OK, they don't see the big picture... but after decades of institutionalized racism, can you blame them for grasping at straws? What should they do until the problem fixes itself? Feel unsafe?</comment>

<comment>They should care about what I think in the same way I care about what they think. We live in a civilization made up of multitudes and in order for that civilization to survive we must be willing to come to agreements.And of course it matters what reality is vs. what they feel the reality is. Objective truth is our only common ground.That being said, there objections have merit, and require solutions and buy-in from the society as a whole.  Saying their solutions are bad, but its the only solutions they have is part of why Conor writes these articles.  To change their minds, to say these solutions are bad and they should look elsewhere.Just look at Conor's response to the BLM movement.  He has actually highlighted and praised the numerous reforms they have recommended.Just because they feel the answers they have are the only ones left available to them, doesn't magically make them good answers.</comment>

<comment>One more question (edit: well OK, two):IS THERE a solution?Can you see yourself grasping at straws, in their position? I can.(also, I don't want to get it twisted. relatively, these kids don't deal with all THAT much racism, but any is enough for concern in my book)</comment>

<comment>The one thing I'm sure of is that any solution will take time. At this point I feel any legal solutions can only tweak the edges of the problem. That's not to say we shouldn't try writing good smart laws that help, but it's no longer THE major obstacleIn my mind what we're dealing with now is less legal challenges and more a cultural shift.  No matter what laws you make, it takes individuals to enforce and interpret them, and so that means we need people to change.Changing people is hard and I honestly think we've made progress, but in the end people are tribal animals. I'm really not sure what the next step is. Improving the economic lives of black people and reforming the justice system seem like the obvious targets to me in this game of social injustice whack-a-mole.As for as seeing myself grasping at straws, sure. I'm empathetic to their frustration, but I also feel that's why they should be challenged.  Conor isn't treating them like children with a pat on the head or actively dismissing them like many of the conservatives do.  He is engaging their proposed solutions in the hopes of making them better.  At least that's the way I read it.</comment>

<comment>"In my mind what we're dealing with now is less legal challenges and more a cultural shift."Here's where my issue with what Conor writes comes into play.Do you really think this article that focuses on the black people who 'want to take away your right to free speech' is doing anybody any favors? The article that paints the whole group as possible criminals (seriously, what do the criminals have to do with Conor's argument? That bit was detestable) will help our culture accept their cause?That's why I take such issue with his framing. He's framing these perfectly innocent kids as criminal Constitution-shredders. Frankly, F*** THAT.</comment>

<comment>See,  I don't see that reading at all.  I see a man engaged with activists he on one hand praises for being idealistic and smart, but also pushing a very dangerous agenda.>He's framing these perfectly innocent kids as criminal Constitution-shredders.I don't think we're even discussing the same column anymore.  I read civic engagement with bad ideas to try and change them.  Being challenged does not equal being victimized.</comment>

<comment>I'm referring to the part where he literally says they're violating the rights of others (even if he also says administrators, he says students too, and FIRST, for what it's worth) and I don't understand why he's talking about the criminals among them. Obviously, those people are wrong. What do they have to do with the larger part of his point, the average protesters?</comment>

<comment>For what it's worth Fred, I don't think you're concern trolling as has been stated.  I think you obviously feel for these students trying to change things for the better and see any article written against them as an attack. Which to be fair, it does tend to play into their detractors hands.  But I also truly believe we should be able to police our own "sides" bad ideas.  We shouldn't be prisoners to our own echo chambers and tip toe around each other for the sake of the cause.</comment>

<comment>By the way, you're alright, Gusto.</comment>

<comment>How wonderful free speech is! Free to talk hate about other races and religions. So much so that you rile up some into such a frenzy that they take out their hatred of others or their religions by taking up arms against them. Free speech can go too far.</comment>

<comment>I say it all the time.  I think someone who supports open borders is voicing an entirely legitimate POV.  Your side is the one claiming people who defend EXISTING US LAWS are engaging in hate speech.   YOU are being anti-American.  Preventing jihadis from entering the US is not hating on a religion.</comment>

<comment>It most certainly is hating on a particular religion when you want no one of that religion to come here. That means you are assuming they are all terrorists or possible terrorists. That is un-American that's not who we are as a country.</comment>

<comment>No one is against Muslims.  We are against terrorists who use Islam.</comment>

<comment>http://thescoopblog.dallasnews...</comment>

<comment>You better relay that message to  Donald Trump then. He apparently thinks all Muslims are possible terrorists. Some sadly are so blinded by Trump they go along with him.</comment>

<comment>So you can restrict rights based on religion but not based upon bigotry?</comment>

<comment>So you naturally favor banning the Bible and Qur'an, correct?  I mean they contain virulent hatred and calls for violence against various groups.  </comment>

<comment>"Look anywhere you like in the world for slavery, for the subjection of women as chattel, for the burning and flogging of homosexuals, for ethnic cleansing, for antisemitism, for all of this, look no further than a famous book that's on every pulpit in this city, and in every synagogue and in every mosque"</comment>

<comment>Free speech is wonderful, because you can use it to demonstrate how those hate-mongers and lunatics are wrong.</comment>

<comment>These students forget that #AllSpeechMatters. Under the guise of helping "marginalized" students these special interest groups are looking to shape college regulations and ultimately state and federal law to follow their own extremist interpretation of morality. Using the same demagogue style Trump has mastered: blaming boogeymen (privilege! supremacy!) and demonizing outsiders (anyone that opposes them).They do not represent all or even most students yet they seek to restrict the behavior of ALL students. Under all the inflammatory rhetoric you can see there is no real intent to help anyone, just a clear attempt to control behavior to conform to their own fundamentalist moral ideas. These extreme lefto-liberal groups want to be the ultimate authority on what is correct and proper; they want to be judge, jury and executioner. It is a destructive force.I hope most sane college students can muster the strength to stand up to the cry-bullies.</comment>

<comment>"spitting on people with whom they disagree; using stigma and “call out” culture rather than persuasion against non-bigoted speech; physically intimidating members of the press; bullying students who disagree with them; shredding newspapers because they disagree with an article; and calling for dissent to be punished. They don’t understand why this is both counterproductive and wrongheaded."The punishing is worse. Granted this example is in Canada, but a man who disagreed with some people on twitter involving some of the pet issues of these protesters was charged and jailed for criminal harassment. In the court precedings, it was revealed that the women on twitter had colluded to file these charges along with city governmental officials. This should be alarming to everyone.One of my biggest regrets from my time in college, was an event that occurred when a traveling evangelical used our free speech circle for a day. The man spouted out some truly over the top Christian beliefs, like women in jeans were sluts and harlots. What the man had to say was pretty reprehensible. The crowd around him showed it. They shouted at him, cussed at him, blow smoke in his face. No one spat on him or touched him (because word had gotten around that he successfully sued a college because a student did something like that). I wish I had the courage at the time to step in chastise my fellow students for their behavior. There's no greater boon for a person like that, than to be able to cast themselves as the oppressed. And in my mind the bullying and intimidation tactics are the antithesis of what a free thinking society should be, particularly one espousing tolerance."Nevertheless, the Afrikan Student Union declared that the party was cultural appropriation."Claims of "cultural appropriation" are one of the most divisive claims that can exist today. It's a euphemism by claimants for their xenophobia, discrimination, and isolationism. If we really want to go down this path, where the people and cultures of others can't be celebrated, imitated, or combined into one's own culture then we're essentially failing the principle point of this country; which is to be a nation of different peoples. Cultural diffusion is a good thing!And if we really want to go down this path, then respectfully, everyone not of European descent, please take down your Christmas trees, wreaths, and stockings. You are appropriating my French and German culture. These traditions while tied to the Christian holiday celebrating the birth of Christ, originate from local cultural and folk traditions. You are robbing us of our identities by stealing these symbols and celebrations.Do you see how ridiculous that last bit sounds?</comment>

<comment>cultural appropriation:  the USofA is a cultural melting pot.  We should (and do) celebrate "cultural appropriation".</comment>

<comment>There is something comically surreal about a fanatized dogma-thumping zombie branding dissidents "bigots", then pretending to protect speech that he himself wants to punish with defamation and ostracism.The sad, increasingly obvious truth is, the oft-vaunted buzzwords principles of liberal democracy has never meant anything more than the personal preferences of the people who used them.As the old Warsaw Pact joke says:Freedom is free people freely doing what they are free to do.</comment>

<comment>You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of what free speech means.  Free speech does not mean that bigots and fools are free from the social consequences of their speech.  Labeling bigots and fools as such is not anti-free speech, it is the marketplace of ideas functioning exactly as it is supposed to function.</comment>

<comment>It's not a social consequence to lose your job over some 'tarded costume. That's a direct result of a bullying by a special interest group, not a representation of how a community at large thinks or finds acceptable.Also, leftist extremists forget the old "punishment fits the offense". Do you really think someone should be expelled from a school for saying a banned word? How can you justify that other than by being a zealot?</comment>

<comment>Except that the "special interest group" happens to be paying customers.Free market, right?</comment>

<comment>re: paying customers. As are all the students across the entire campus and even more those whose parents are footing their tuition bill and the freebies of others.</comment>

<comment>Well, yeah, it is a social consequence.  You can argue that it is too severe a social consequence, or that the company was wrong for what it did, but that is, in fact, a social consequence.Do you really think someone should be expelled from a school for saying a banned word?Well, context is everything, but I don't in general think that students should be expelled for speech, or that there should be "banned words."</comment>

<comment>The Liberal party displayed itsnature in the recent incident with the shooting at the PlannedParenthood center.  There was a tentative effort by Liberal partyshills to say that the video that proved Planned Parenthood engagesin the flesh trade of peddling fetal body parts for cash resulted inthe attack and that, therefor, those who shot the video wereresponsible for what [happened.     The Liberal party trying to punish“free speech”.     And especially after so manyLiberal party thugs cheered the malingerers who drew wretched, hatefilled caricatures of Mohammed, deceitfully called them “cartoons”,then tried to use them to initiate Muslim violence so the New WorldOrder could begin the Final Solution to the Muslim Problem.  In thatepisode, it was declared that those who respond to such things areanswerable for their own actions, no one else is at fault.  Yet, now,the same individuals were saying that the people who shot the videowere effectively the ones who pulled the trigger in PlannedParenthood!     Liberal party hypocrisy.  The sameas in the article.  They push for restrictions to try to keep uglytruths about protected groups unsaid, as part of their deal withleaders of the groups for votes and political influence, but thatresults in “freedom of speech” being infringed upon.     Basically, the Liberal party islike any corrupt, big money swindle.  “It's okay if I do it, it'swrong if you do it.”     Interestingly, Catholicism hassomething similar.  If you tell an ugly truth about a rich personthat prevents that rich person from succeeding in swindling the “rankand file”, the corrupt, rich power mongers in “The Church”define that as a form of lying!  They called is “detraction”. Telling the truth is a form of lying!     The fact is, the Liberal party isthe same as the Catholic “Church”, the Republicans, nay otherrotted power mongering gang of unprincipled thugs.</comment>

<comment>Untruthful videos painting others as murder-profiteers cause violent backlash.Now, did I just take away your free speech rights by saying that?</comment>

<comment>I noticed the pro-student commenter squad have just moved onto complaining about Conor even talking about this, so progress!</comment>

<comment>It's the framing.If he's painting these kids as criminals and unconstitutional shills, we'll end up addressing the wrong problem. This has NOTHING to do with free speech rights, except on the back end. His argument is about MERIT, not freedom of speech.Arguing about freedom of speech moreso than the merit of the argument, IMO, is in itself politically correct.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Your comment is, in itself, designed to restrict the speech of others (who happen to want to restrict the speech of others, in your words).This is the contradiction I'm trying to point out.... but I acknowledge I'm not doing a great job at framing it myself.</comment>

<comment>Basically, how long can you gripe about political correctness before you become politically correct yourself?</comment>

<comment>"He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper." - Edmund BurkeThere really should be no debate against Conor, and the fact that there is leads me to believe that the opposing side is either disingenuous or ignorant.</comment>

<comment>How is it not disingenuous to take a mainly Constitutionalist standpoint when what you're really talking about is the MERIT of the students' argument?</comment>

<comment>Both.</comment>

<comment>All very true, Conor.There are laws, and there is power.  Too often people create laws to protect the powerless, but the powerful can then use the same laws for their ends.Its not just free speech.  The drug laws were to protect the poor addicts.  Crack laws were to protect minority communities.  But these laws were used on those they were intended to protect.In the middle east, a lot of the restrictions on women are justified as ways to protect women and girls from men, but of course end up boxing them in.</comment>

<comment>I'll be honest... I get a bit of a kick out of so many conservatives lamenting being on the downside of the marketplace of ideas in this particular arena.I still hold the belief that many conservatives wouldn't be conservatives if they could fathom that their ideas may be potential losers in the marketplace. Well, here's your example. I hope you get a good feeling for what being on the downside of the marketplace feels like, and what you might do to get your viewpoint back on top.... because that's what these kids are doing.When the marketplace of ideas never ends up correcting the ideas that negatively affect you, perhaps you'd start to criticize the effectiveness of the marketplace itself too.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>What if the entire marketplace thinks certain speech products shouldn't be allowed on the shelf? Would you enforce your freedom of speech on them? Does the marketplace still function to serve the masses at that point?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>But again... what if the market decides it wants to limit speech? I thought the marketplace was open to ANY idea which gains enough momentum...(to maybe guide this down the right track, I'll clarify by telling you that I'm making a case against the marketplace of ideas being the end all be all of how we should make decisions)</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>So would you say the marketplace requires guidance by moral 'laws' to do its job?If the 'laws' disintegrate because of the majority's greed, hate, etc., what happens? How many people are victimized?That's where I see a flaw in the entire theory of the marketplace.... then again, I don't necessarily advocate against the marketplace, as I don't know that I necessarily like the other end of the spectrum.</comment>

<comment>Except that it's not "the entire marketplace". It is a small but very vocal group with access to a huge loudspeaker called the internet.</comment>

<comment>....the marketplace doesn't care about numbers of members, it cares about numbers of dollars. (It's not about a loud voice at all really... it's about a thick wallet)The schools cave to the students because they need those students. If they didn't they'd simply tell them to get lost.</comment>

<comment>These kids and the administrators are promoting censorship which has been ruled unconstitutional in countless trials. This idea has failed in the "marketplace of ideas" as you put it. And rightfully so.You are obviously upset that people do not approve of your brand of censorship that you have trolled this comment board looking to incite."The Chappelle Show" would not be allowed to run on these campuses due to its edgy comedy.</comment>

<comment>Again, your issue is with them promoting something you disagree with. There's no place in your comment for a constitutional argument.If the idea failed in the marketplace like you say it did..... nobody would be caving to their demands. Their ideas have clout; don't get it twisted.</comment>

<comment>Wow. Thanks for putting words in my mouth.I have no problem with people promoting social justice. I have a problem when their methods include coercion through expurgation laws that have been ruled unconstitutional.Administrators are caving into their demands because they are spineless but the courts will rule against them as has been shown throughout history.You are on the wrong side of this debate--in fact you are arguing something completely different.</comment>

<comment>By "your issue is with them promoting something you disagree with", I was talking about the fact that they seek to restrict speech, not the social justice bit. Sorry for the confusion.Does our freedom of speech not give them the right to speak out against freedom of speech? Does the simple fact that you're protesting them not put you in the exact same position they're in when they protest the administrators (aside from the actual content of your arguments, which isn't part of the 'free speech' point you're making)?</comment>

<comment>Okay, yes, I disagree with their movement's methods of restricting speech through censorship legislation.Yes, they have the right to use their free speech to protest free speech. Nazis have the right to march, artists have the right to put a crucifix in a jar of piss.And I have the right to protest their expurgation movement. And I have the right to point out how fruitless their efforts are considering the large amount of cases that have gone against them.Are you concern trolling? You appear to be doing so.</comment>

<comment>I don't know what concern trolling is.But no, I don't think I am. This is deeper for me. I link this mindset Conor has to the sham that is "political correctness."A vast majority of the time the label "PC" is slapped on someone, their ideas aren't heard. It's the same way when "racist" is slapped on someone; their ideas aren't heard. Difference is, MOST of the time "racist" is applied (I know there's plenty of exceptions), the constructive conversation wasn't going to happen anyway, as one side was starting the conversation with a generalization. In my observation, people slap "PC" on more legitimate concerns than people slap "racist" on legitimate concerns. Then again, I'm in the south, so maybe my view is skewed.(As a disclaimer, I'm not talking about the people who just throw "racist" around on everything that involves race. I'm talking specifically about throwing "racist" on a racial generalization, which I see as being the majority)</comment>

<comment>If you read what Conor wrote above, he does not label anyone in order to silence them.In fact he calls for more dialogue, in direct contrast with the group you appear to sympathize with.</comment>

<comment>No, he only told us these kids were directly violating the constitutional rights of others and are to be associated with the criminals among them. </comment>

<comment>The way I see it, applying labels like 'fascists' and 'criminals' isn't far off from demanding teachers be removed from their positions. He's deceiving his way into changing minds. I take issue with that. He's been doing it for thousands of words now.</comment>

<comment>As I said earlier, you are concern trolling.You favor speech codes in order to further the conversation but you make the rules about what is right and wrong before the conversation begins.Your avatar is from a Chappelle skit that would be protested against at length by these students and administrators for its harmful images. It would be silenced--and you wouldn't raise a finger in protest.</comment>

<comment>Is Devil's Advocate now called "concern trolling?"I don't know where you got the idea that I'm necessarily FOR limiting free speech.</comment>

<comment>"... it infuriates me that 99% of the time (an obvious hyperbole) somebody rails against PC, they're simply railing against somebody else's ideas under this supposedly noble, uber-Patriotic free speech guise. It's nothing of the sort, but people eat it up. Meanwhile, none of the conversations that need to happen happen."It makes you angry that others use their right to free speech to speak against others that you agree with. Then, you lament that we can't have the conversations you think are necessary. So, you support the students who are currently manipulating their spineless administrators to create speech codes that will ensure that not only does the conversation take place, but the campus will conform to the conclusion of the pre-arranged conversation.They aren't criminals, they are just misguided youths. The administrators and teachers are the ones who should know better and inform their students that they need to realize that free speech trumps their demands.Edit: Just look at your OP! </comment>

<comment>"It makes you angry that others use their right to free speech to speak against others that you agree with."No, it makes me angry that they don't address the actual subject at hand and only address whether somebody's American enough...The other half of open debate being constructive is that it has to be on-topic. Ignoring the concerns of somebody because you deem them PC doesn't do anything for anybody.</comment>

<comment>"No, it makes me angry that they don't address the actual subject at hand and only address whether somebody's American enough...""The other half of open debate being constructive is that it has to be on-topic."What better way to make sure everyone is on topic and talking about the subject at hand then by creating speech codes, amiright?</comment>

<comment>Jesus Christ</comment>

<comment>So you can tell these kids what you think is constructive conversation but I can't tell you what I think is constructive conversation?How do you not see the hypocrisy?</comment>

<comment>Hypocrisy?I believe a constructive conversation is open to all ideas and angles of approach and none can be silenced and all are heard.Your idea of a constructive conversation is one where only a limited number of ideas are allowed to be presented and others are censored.Do you not see how wrong you are?</comment>

<comment>So then the debate is open to their ideas that speech should be limited.It's settled.</comment>

<comment>Yes! I said that already!I also added it is a venture that has failed from the start because it will never make it through the courts.</comment>

<comment>K,</comment>

<comment>And two can play your little game:"So, you support the students who are currently manipulating their spineless administrators"So you don't support students for practicing their free speech rights?</comment>

<comment>I'll quote myself from an earlier post:"Okay, yes, I disagree with their movement's methods of restricting speech through censorship legislation.Yes, they have the right to use their free speech to protest free speech. Nazis have the right to march, artists have the right to put a crucifix in a jar of piss."You are a concern troll.</comment>

<comment>Can you stop with the names? I'm trying to have a conversation in good faith and you seem intent on labeling me.</comment>

<comment>"A concern troll is a person who participates in a debate posing as an actual or potential ally who simply has some concerns they need answered before they will ally themselves with a cause. In reality they are a critic"</comment>

<comment>I love that when you object to somebody's speech, it turns into "manipulation."</comment>

<comment>"A vast majority of the time the label "PC" is slapped on someone, their ideas aren't heard. It's the same way when "racist" is slapped on someone; their ideas aren't heard. Difference is, MOST of the time "racist" is applied (I know there's plenty of exceptions), the constructive conversation wasn't going to happen anyway, as one side was starting the conversation with a generalization."This is the height of irony. You lament in the quotation above how the term 'racist' is used to silence someone.This is exactly what the students are doing to their administrators: labeling them bigots and racists. It is a form of manipulation.You are doing these ridiculous gymnastics in order to agree with these students. It's hilarious.</comment>

<comment>I can't do it. I see where this is going.YOU'RE IRONICNO YOU'RE IRONICYOU'RE A HYPOCRITENO YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE</comment>

<comment>Please point out where I have equivocated in my belief of free speech. Please point out a contradiction.</comment>

<comment>I already did. You ignored it.You're allowed to tell the students what viewpoints are and aren't acceptable but I'm not allowed to tell you what I think is and isn't acceptable.</comment>

<comment>We are allowed to correct each other. We are allowed to speak freely.I am not allowed to create a law that dictates how you speak and what you should say. That is what these students are asking their administrators for.I am using persuasion. You are allying with a group that is pro-censorship.</comment>

<comment>K.</comment>

<comment>TBH, it infuriates me that 99% of the time (an obvious hyperbole) somebody rails against PC, they're simply railing against somebody else's ideas under this supposedly noble, uber-Patriotic free speech guise. It's nothing of the sort, but people eat it up. Meanwhile, none of the conversations that need to happen happen. </comment>

<comment>Conor, it is so unfortunate this has to be your crusade! We should hope that children are already taught these lessons of the past - particularly that rules used to intimidate and silence one class can be used on another. Part of me feels that kids these days have had their growth stunted by a couple years - the idealism and rebelliousness usually associated with highschool years is being discovered in college, and we can only hope by the time they enter the workforce they can see how ridiculous they appear</comment>

<comment>"particularly that rules used to intimidate and silence one class can be used on another."I personally believe that's what's happening when these students protest. This isn't the front end.... it's the back end.</comment>

<comment>So what happens when you implement these policies and they don't go the way you want?  Each one of these protests not only involve Race, but Gender and Sexuality as well..So what happens when more white women start coming forward and getting black men kicked out of college for "making them feel unsafe".  or gay white men come forward saying a group of black students used hate language towards them?Do you really think this policy is only going to protect the black students? Or women? or LGBT? What happens when those groups members have a conflict?  You're asking to hand more power to administrators in deciding which peoples feelings to act upon.How does that seem like a good idea?</comment>

<comment>I'd like you to show me where I agreed with censoring the speech of others.</comment>

<comment>Well that was the context of the comment you replied to.  The idea that the policies these students are asking for can and likely will be used against themI apologize if I misunderstood the intent of your reply.</comment>

<comment>TBH, most of the people I've gone after aren't all that far off from me as far as opinions about the students' methods. I think the students are wrong too. I just also think that freedom of expression will never end racism and the detriments that come from it (and even if it does end it at some point, that doesn't exactly help CURRENT students, does it?).I think these kids have a right to make any demands they want to make. They're paying for it, FFS.</comment>

<comment>I dont think these students have been particularly silenced. They are the flavor of the week in the media - even small schools no one has heard of have made it into the spotlight. Further they are getting their resignations and dont seem particularly intimidated in any of the videos I have seen, they seem to be doing plenty of intimidation themselves!It is unfortunate. It wasnt terribly long ago I was a college student - in my day we protested the increasing cost of public education and the lack of access increasing fees would have on our more underprivileged and disenfranchised members. Our conversation and rhetoric and tactics were different - but it is sad because I feel like we shared some similar goals - mostly increasing access to higher education.We didnt want to be "safe" though! We faced down police batons and tear gas and chained ourselves to building roofs. We didnt want to be homogeneous either. One of the greatest moments was seeing campus Republicans, SSDP, various leftist clubs (democratic socialists, communists), members of greek life, sports teams, everyone coming together in favor of this goal. We didnt marginalize anyone, tell them they couldnt speak because of who they were or what they said. Maybe 80% of it I disagreed with but ya know what? people probably disagreed with most of what I thought . They got the privilege to hear me and disagree though</comment>

<comment>One thing we are seeing among civil rights activists aligned with Cobb are increases in false flag operations.  Actual cases of racism are like unicorns --- they never are actually documented.  No one ever actually catches them on film.  They are almost always apocryphal.  So, the activists simply need to perform the hate speech themselves in order to make it appear as though racists exist.  Everyone knows this happens.  When is this going to be covered by the Atlantic?  There could be a very good long-form piece on this.</comment>

<comment>Denial is a wonderful rationalization tool, in'nit?</comment>

<comment>Can you please be more specific?  I am talking about racism on college campuses.  Like YALE for gawd sakes.</comment>

<comment>"false flag operations"</comment>

<comment>There have been several reports.  University of Chicago was a recent one.</comment>

<comment>Deus, you do realize you're the living stereotype of every frat boy ever?</comment>

<comment>Poor attempt at an insult?</comment>

<comment>An observation.  Are you offended at being stereotyped because you joined a fraternity?</comment>

<comment>Go f@ck yourself.</comment>

<comment>So you are offended.</comment>

<comment>When all else fails, make up a conspiracy! Then NOBODY can argue against you!</comment>

<comment>...http://www.dailywire.com/news/1044/to...</comment>

<comment>Therefore, racism is fake.</comment>

<comment>Did I say that?</comment>

<comment>You literally called racism a unicorn.</comment>

<comment>I added on college campuses.  This is within the bounds of the discussion.</comment>

<comment>....you believe that?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I went to college.  I was in a frat and one year there was just one black guy going through white rush basically and he joined my frat and honest to god I know the guy well and racism never came up.  He was just one of the guys.  I never saw racism really.  This was in 1990 in a state that is like 99% white.</comment>

<comment>Therefore, racism is fake!</comment>

<comment>On college campus?  Yep, it is fake. 100% fake.  I am dead serious.</comment>

<comment>On college campus? Yep, it is fake. 100% fake. I am dead serious.When that fraternity in Oklahoma was singing the song last year about how there would "never be a n****r in SAE, You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me" were they being ironic?  Or was that another false flag operation?</comment>

<comment>There was a guy on CNN the week this broke and he was a former black SAE member at Oklahoma.   He said he was a proud SAE alum and in his 4 years he saw nothing like this.  I agree that the incident was disgusting.  If I had been on that bus and a pledge I would have been very ashamed.  I cannot explain it.  There were no blacks present, and it was a song.  I am not sure how this is an act of racism.  It changes nothing as to my claim.</comment>

<comment>"There will never be a n***** at SAE,... you can hang 'em from a tree" is no longer racist. Got it.Like I said, denial is wonderful, in'nit?</comment>

<comment>If the N-word is in a rap song, Does it count too?</comment>

<comment>I don't care about the "n-word".... I care about "there will never be a [insert racial demographic] at SAE."</comment>

<comment>How many times do I have to tell you that the WAS a black at this SAE chapter?</comment>

<comment>I don't understand the significance of that.I'm moving on.</comment>

<comment>OK, so long.</comment>

<comment>You aren't sure how a bus full of white frat boys singing a song about how there would "never be a n****r in SAE, You can hang him from a tree, but he can never sign with me" is racism.This is a stunning level of intellectual dishonesty.</comment>

<comment>Meh.  There WAS a black at this SAE chapter (!!) and also in my fraternity in a very similar school.  Do you actually read these comments we write, Tyler? Most blacks go through black rush, though, and I am going by 1990 rush practices at my school.</comment>

<comment>Why do you keep telling stories and assuming that must be the case everywhere?</comment>

<comment>What do you know?</comment>

<comment>Again, my personal anecdotes don't imply the same happens everywhere.Anyway, you're the one saying racism exists NOWHERE. I'm not saying it exists EVERYWHERE. So a single example of racism on campus would prove your generalization wrong. We already did that part.</comment>

<comment>Well, it certainly exists in rap songs, do those count?</comment>

<comment>There WAS a black at this SAE chapter (!!)Which speaks to their accuracy, not their racism.and also in my fraternity in a very similar school. So if there was "a black" in your fraternity, this particular song cannot be racist.  Makes even more sense now.Tell me, how would you have felt singing this particular song in front of "a black" in your fraternity?</comment>

<comment>I said it was disgusting.  I said I would have been very ashamed.  What more do you want?  I was in a fraternity.  I was someone who was very active in the social life and Greek system at an major and reputable public university.  I knew 100s of people very closely on campus.  I did not see one act of racism in my four years in 1990.  Not one.  Did I ever see a guy say the N-word?  Yeah, I saw it. It was very very rare and not socially acceptable.  I never saw someone call a black student any epithet. I can only tell you the truth.</comment>

<comment>I said it was disgusting. I said I would have been very ashamed. But if it wasn't racist, why would you be disgusted or ashamed?I was in a fraternity.This is my not shocked face.</comment>

<comment>I love fraternities and sororities.  Blacks love them too. They are great American institutions.   Obviously you would have no idea, hater that you are. You are a bigot, there is no surprise there in this detestable, repugnant expression of hatred of yours.</comment>

<comment>Who said anything bad about them? A little touchy, are we? Is laughing at frat boys not politically correct enough for you? (If this comment was in response to a liberal, it'd get at least 15 upvotes, simply for mentioning political correctness. Hell, I might even end up leading the GOP race)</comment>

<comment>You didn't answer my question--if that song isn't racist, why would you be disgusted or ashamed of it?</comment>

<comment>I think our attempts at logic will be fruitless. I don't know why I tried. He doesn't see the flaw in his "anecdotes are not data" data points. Why would he here?</comment>

<comment>You expressed a very hateful, bigoted remark, a nasty insult...vicious hateful bigotry, and now you expect me you answer you????  HA</comment>

<comment>Have you been a troll the whole time or do you just revert to trollism when backed into a corner?</comment>

<comment>try harder, tadpole</comment>

<comment>Aw man I'm bummed you didn't lol @ 'trollism'</comment>

<comment>You think expressing no surprise that you were in a fraternity to be a "hateful, bigoted remark, a nasty insult...vicious hateful bigotry."  That says something.Of course, your refusal to answer the obvious question isn't really surprising, because any reasonable person would understand that the song is racist, and be rightfully disgusted and/or embarrassed.</comment>

<comment>You know, I recall very well our first discussion.  You were oblivious to the fact that the American Indians died mainly from diseases the settlers were immune to.  This is a fact so widely written about now I believe it is taught in elementary school.  You claimed Americans "conquered" America (go figure that one out!).    When are you going to learn that it is impossible for someone to sink lower in my estimation than you?  I don't have to answer you.  You are a hater.  You are a little Robespierre, a pseudo-intellectual.  You cannot insult me.  You have a tumor in your head you mistake for a brain.  Time for a lobotomy!</comment>

<comment>Another noble effort at changing the subject.  When you are backed into a corner, you certainly do have your playbook:  accuse someone of bigotry because they don't agree with you, and if that bait isn't taken, then try to change the topic to your extremely poor recollection of a conversation from months ago.</comment>

<comment>You insulted me first today.  You insulted a lot of people, black and white, who are proud members of the Greek system.</comment>

<comment>You realize that you've just implied that it is an insult to YOU that I wasn't surprised that you were in a fraternity, and an insult to FRATS to that I wasn't surprised you were in one.So both parties should be insulted at the association, according to you.</comment>

<comment>Also, why did you take that offensively? Do you have the idea that the viewpoints you're spewing are pretty abhorrent, therefore, when somebody is not surprised you were a frat boy, they must be calling frat boys abhorrent? If what you're saying is proper, in your mind, wouldn't "this is my not shocked face" be a compliment to frats?</comment>

<comment>You are lying.   I have said nothing "abhorrent".  I thought you were "done with me"?</comment>

<comment>As predicted, you missed the point. </comment>

<comment>The word "racist" seems to have been banned or something....He'll say everything except that particular word. Politically correct conservatives have washed that word from his mind, even when things are actually racist.I've been looking for an example of 'conservative correctness' doing the same exact thing 'liberal correctness' does (washing ideas from peoples' minds).... I don't know that I'll find a better one than this.</comment>

<comment>If you hate me (which you do), then you hate all white people (which you do).  I am far more liberal than the average white.</comment>

<comment>I'm white. So let's end that bulls*** right now.</comment>

<comment>Does not change anything.  Why point this out?  I am white too.</comment>

<comment>because you said i hate all white people...</comment>

<comment>I stand by that.</comment>

<comment>k.</comment>

<comment>It can't be racist, because 100% of racism on campus has been eliminated.  What's hard to understand about that, dummy!Plus, he knew "a black" in 1990, so who would know better?</comment>

<comment>The insistence on mentioning that it was 1990, for whatever reason, was funny to me.</comment>

<comment>Nothing says "I'm not a racist" like talking about "a black" (or "the blacks,") amirite?</comment>

<comment>He was one of the good ones.  A real credit to his race.</comment>

<comment>Quit your complainin', black people. If it's got a melody, there ain't no malady!</comment>

<comment>See. This is what you get for arguing with someone who genuinely appears to believe that the plural of anecdote is data.</comment>

<comment>You are free to post your "data"</comment>

<comment>I would say "you didn't understand what I posted," but that should be taken as a given. It's not about me having data or not. It's about you using a specific example to assert, definitively, that a condition is universal. That is fallacious.</comment>

<comment>OK, you win.  I lose.  Are you happy now?</comment>

<comment>I only wish that Conner had posted a link to pictures taken at the "Kanye Western theme party".</comment>

<comment>I looked up the pictures myself.  Other than the woman who stuffed what looked like a pillow in her pants to look like Kim, it all looked fairly benign.</comment>

<comment>Free speech does not give anyone right to abuse that freedom and offend or slander with freedom and right comes responsibilities which either have to be self regulated or regulated by neutral body</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.  Free speech means that you have the freedom to offend, or it doesn't mean anything.</comment>

<comment>NO NO NO NONsense , sense sense , it depends upon the legal code as everyone's definition of  free speech and its allowable usage has become relative</comment>

<comment>This is word salad.</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>"become relative"Maybe, but the Supreme Court decisions are pretty specific. Seeing as how that's what matters......</comment>

<comment>"Freedom of speech means freedom for those who you despise, and freedom to express the most despicable views. It also means that the government cannot pick and choose which expressions to authorize and which to prevent." –Alan Dershowitz</comment>

<comment>Actually it does give free reign to say what you think. Maybe not slander, but to addendum others sure is. And besides what I think is fine, might be offensive to you, so why should I curtail my speech based on your feelings?</comment>

<comment>Where in the phrase "Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech" do you see mention of the citizen's responsibility not to offend? What's offensive changes all the time, based on popular morays and beliefs, as well as the march of social progress. Expression is what makes us unique; what makes us human. If you don't like a given expression, ignore it, or challenge it using your own rights and faculties as a human being. But don't tell me that it's your right to suppress it so long as enough people (i.e. your "neutral body") agree with you that it's offensive. That just tyranny of the majority, which the Bill of Rights was written to avoid.</comment>

<comment>Nobody has the right to not be offended. That's patently absurd.Slander and libel are well-defined in the law, so such abuses of free speech are "regulated."</comment>

<comment>The loaded-with-potential-for-oppression free speech, freedom to assemble, etc., were the tools that ended slavery, enfranchised women, ended de jure segregation and gave rise to the Civil (1964) and Voting Rights (1965) Act, as well as the decriminalization of homosexual conduct and the legalization, in a stroke, of same sex marriage.Is that a baby you want to throw out to drain the remaining bath water?It's simplistic, but potentially insightful, to consider that the most egregious sins are the easiest to expiate (Just. Stop. Lynching.), that the least (microaggressions, anyone?) the most difficult.  I see that as the nature of all progress (as well as most physical processes).  Abandoning principles that have been the greatest tools in making that progress to obtain the last facets of redemption seems not only ungrateful (in particular to those who, in the 18th Century, risked death by hanging after a judgment of treason against the Crown), but unwise: Have those freedoms no more battles to be used in?  </comment>

<comment>Still going with the "hands up, don't shoot" photo op huh?</comment>

<comment>They put a picture of student protesters at the top of an article about the sentiments expressed by certain student protesters. Like how they might put a picture of Mitch McConnell at the top of an article about Mitch McConnell or a picture of Ted Cruz at the top of an article about sociopathy.</comment>

<comment>Honestly?So many of these activists are protesting because of the psychic benefits, jousting at paper tigers because it gains them social credit to do so. They should be excluded from the conversation, not given a central seat at the table.</comment>

<comment>Bravo, Mr. Friedersdorf for a comprehensive, thoughtful and convincing essay. It is ironic beyond words that SOME (thankfully not a majority) on the progressive side defend this attack on the First Amendment and academic freedom. We who are over 55 know only too well who it was imposing speech codes in the  60's and 1970's. We also remember which side harassed professors because of either their actual or perceived politics. Why any progressive who knows who the late Mario Savio was can support these horribly ill advised actions is beyond me. History shows that the right imposes restrictions and the progressive side wants robust academic freedom. But some have forgotten this.  It is coming close to the Maoist cultural revolution with students waving their little red books and denouncing educators, professionals, and their next-door neighbor.  Those on the right who tend to swoop in and support your arguments might be less enthusiastic if they (1) understood conservative history and (2) if the campus activists pushing this were Christian conservatives or frat boys rather than mostly females and/or black students. I'm very much a skeptic when it comes to this sudden embrace of academic freedom and free ranging speech by the right. They enthuse about it only because those they don't like are being opposed.</comment>

<comment>this has been in the making for about 25 years. liberties are to yield to ever-expanding rights, including the "right" not to feel bad or offended </comment>

<comment>It may seem shallow but I couldn't find a single good looking woman in that photo. Was it ugly chicks protest day or something?</comment>

<comment>That's right. For you, the only good-looking women are ones with bruises on their faces. </comment>

<comment>Ask yourself why you feel the need to disparage me. You know full well I am nothing like your boy friend de jour.</comment>

<comment>I'm straight. Nice try. </comment>

<comment>white supremacist policies? what kind of clap trap is this? </comment>

<comment>i don't think these kids are going to be impresed with this patriarchical "back in my day" lecturing. </comment>

<comment>Or the fact that female students came out of their father's john thomases. They may need access to the nearest safe space when this microaggression is explained to them without any trigger warnings.</comment>

<comment>You didn't have good parents did you? Sorry to hear that. Anytime someone complains about "patriarchical" anything its a clear sign of a poor family structure. </comment>

<comment>anyone notice that in the past, a person would start a counter point with, "I think that . . ." whereas now such a statement begins with "Well I feel like . . . " </comment>

<comment>AKA: Truthiness</comment>

<comment>In fact, the First Amendment has protected lampooning a member of the religious right by portraying him as having sex with his drunken mother in an outhouse. It has protected putting a crucifix in a jar of urine.These things are okay because Christian/Republican but could an SNL comedian lampoon Hillary Clinton by portraying her as having sex with her drunken father in an outhouse? Would the FA protect putting an image of The Prophet in a jar of urine?</comment>

<comment>The photo shows the kids doing the hands up don't shoot hoax.</comment>

<comment>I thought they were all saying "the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire" (80's reference.)</comment>

<comment>Oh the irony...</comment>

<comment>The government should not regulate speech in any way whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>Conor, you are casting pearls before swine.They do not understand what you are saying. They do not know how to act as adults in public, they do not respect anything except their own perceptions of "good"."My opinions are on the side of goodness and righteousness, anything which interferes with my thinking process is bad." They are fighting against the very thing they were sent to school to learn.Life is the act of confronting obstacles; how you interact with these obstacles is more important than merely overcoming the obstacle in question. Denying others their right to free speech, or denying others the right to self defense, are the moral equivalent to lynching.These children are not yet ready to fly. Conor, I admire you for making the attempt, but you were wasting your time.</comment>

<comment>There's a difference between offensive speech and threatening hate speech. Right wing conservatives don't seem to understand that.</comment>

<comment>For leftists "free speech" means speech they approve of. All inconvenient facts or opinions qualify as "offensive", "threatening" or "hate", depending on the shrillness and medication level of the SJW in question. Reality check: all speech is free speech, excluding "fighting words" addressed to a specific person with the aim to provoke immediate violence.</comment>

<comment>You do not have an unlimited right to speech. If you yell fire in a theater, you're in trouble. If you threaten people, that's also going to get you in trouble. Conservatives like you think that you can yell anything you want without consequences. Then, when you're busted for threatening minorities or any other group that isn't white, religious men, you weep as you claim to be a victim of PC.</comment>

<comment>What a shrill leftist like you calls "threatening" and what is "threatening" in objective, factual reality are two separate things. You can criticize minorities as much as you please as long as you don't incite to specific violence ("Hey, guys, let's get to the corner of Main and Oak and set fire to the family who lives there"). Like most leftists you attempt to silence ANY criticism of minorities by a labeling anything critical of them "threatening". That's not how objective reality (and law) works.</comment>

<comment>Nicely said by a white guy enjoying the hell out of his white, elite privilege in this nation. Threatening speech doesn't seem so bad when its you doing all the threatening.</comment>

<comment>Your fixation with mythical, non-existent "white privilege" is quite amusing.</comment>

<comment>"White privilege," like "male privilege" are easily-demonstrated concepts. That doesn't mean they aren't sometimes taken to absurd extremes, but categorically denying their very existence would be the opposite extreme and so is equally absurd (and serves as an ironic example of how privilege manifests).</comment>

<comment>Non-existent? Ha! Good luck living in that fantasy.</comment>

<comment>Prove that "white privilege" is real.If you can...</comment>

<comment>Restricting speech (imminent incitement and other outliers notwithstanding) is going to teach those who advocate it some very harsh and ironic lessons if they ever actually get what they mistakenly believe they want.Blowback's a... well, you know.</comment>

<comment>Gee, that's a bit vague.</comment>

<comment>The word "ironic" was the big hint.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps the protest movements are being intentionally discredited with  COINTELPRO-style tactics?Such movements have been played like fiddles in the past so as to render them into hollow parodies of themselves, which results in their not being taken seriously by the public at large (i.e. "mission accomplished!").After all, as the old saying goes, "there's a sucker born every minute."</comment>

<comment>CF is unable to resist the sophistical technique which couples description of a complaint or political demand with an action that such as 'spitting" or "trashing" something that is to target of that objection or demand.This is argument by juxtaposition which attempts to encourage the rejection of the complaint  expressed with the disapproval of the actions that are mentioned and attributed to the people making the complaint. This is a fallacious form of argument that may be effective but is dishonest and manipulative.There is another element to CF's sophistry on this subject. He uses objections against legal or administrative attempts to restrict hate speech to imply or suggest that strong expressions of public disapproval which he terms "shaming" are equally to be rejected as threats to free speech.This is another way of choosing which speech to allow in the guise of preventing that from happening.  Simply put: "shaming' is disapproval expressed in speech, for the purpose of shaping conduct. All speech has the effect of shaping conduct, but CF proposes to put out of play use of speech to express disapproval of racist and sexist speech which he refers to as shaming.</comment>
