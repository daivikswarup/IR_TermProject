<comment>Liz Cheney is a chip off the old block. Another horrible piece of work just like her father who by the way should be on trial in the Hague for war crimes.</comment>

<comment>The Cheney family is probably the worst of all the American political dynasties that need to be destroyed. The descendants of Vlad the Impaler might just be better and more trustworthy people than the Cheney's.</comment>

<comment>The US surely wouldn't elect a British prince, would you?  Because if so, QEII could stump the money for his Superpac, and you wouldn't have to worry about having to vote ever again.Prince Charles, heir to Dracula's blood line“The genealogy shows I am descended from Vlad the Impaler, so I do have a bit of a stake in the country.”</comment>

<comment>She might be able to soften her image with a short video of her running over bikers in a Yukon.  That's just the right amount of pointless viciousness for her would-be constituents without going too far.</comment>

<comment>Bikers, like hells angels?</comment>

<comment>Liz has little beady eyes.</comment>

<comment>What's a Liz Cheney ? Is that like a code word for minion of the devil ?</comment>

<comment>Great, just what the GOP needs, more neocons. Please, please, Cheneys, Bushs, please retire. Please. No one likes you anymore. I would vote for a Bush or a Cheney as likely as I would vote for a Clinton or Obama. Just...please, Wyoming, don't do this.</comment>

<comment>When did the name of a chicken hawk war criminal become a springboard for a legislative career? Ms. Cheney's resume is very interesting if narratives of nepotism interest you. Even with all that familial help, she's made a mess of every opportunity ever provided. Her Senate run was rolling disaster visible even from the east coast cheap seats. Insulting friends, dividing her own family, antagonizing political allies and, apparently, trying to defraud your Fish and Game Department. You threw her back the last time. With good reasons. Wyoming does not need to elect a chronic failure from out of state to fill their one seat in the House. There must be over a hundred thousand people that are both qualified and actual residents of Wyoming who could do a better job.</comment>

<comment>I'm a Wyoming Republican. I know Dick and Lynn Cheney. I am Al and Ann Simpson's lifelong friend (she was my preschool teacher while Al was going through law school). Liz Cheney and her husband Phil Perry are the most disgusting examples of the proto-fascist mentality that her father and the Rumsfeld-backed military-industrial-Congressional complex has produced (the one Eisenhower warned about in 1961: leaving out Congress because of the taste of McCarthyism still in people's mouths).Starting with the Project for a new American Century (PNAC), Rumsfeld and Cheney have set America up to be in a permanent state of war, as an employment tool! Example: The largest employer in Wyoming is the USAF. It "contributes" $350 million/year to the Cheyenne economy...at a national cost of over a billion dollars. The American global military empire now operates from 4800 mostly secret bases. We rape Okinawa women...traffic assault rifles into Northern Mexico...and we have forces arrayed across what PNAC calls an "arc of engagement" so that America can use "FULL SPECTRUM DOMINATION" to control the world's resources! That is not a Wyoming value. That is a fascist value; and the Cheney's sick book about American "Exceptionalism" is crap, based on the fascist notion that we control the Earth...and only liberals don't like it!Liz Cheney's husband, Phil Perry, is the architect-of and legal council-for the emerging American police state. BECAUSE America is a failing, collapsing and bankrupted global military empire...we now turn on ourselves with a police state:TSA screens for people with warrants- not just guns and bottles of water.USBP checkpoints and traffic stops are legal within 100 miles of all US borders: which conditions 190 million Americans to accept checkpoint "authority." The NRA is the marketing arm of small arms manufacturers; always pumping up the perceived threat so that every American will be known to police as being armed...and military-armed SWAT teams now regularly perform warrant delivery.Here in Wyoming, a documented police terrorist has just been elevated to control of the Wyoming Highway Patrol, by an elitist friend of Cheney, Simpson, et al: the rich boy governor Matt Mead. In 2008, US Atty Mead protected the terrorist from being "outed". Now, Mead has elevated this scum- over the entire WHP chain of command; and Kebin Haller is now "exercising" WHP in multi-agency clampdowns of entire highway networks . What is coming is NDAA 2012 warrantless arrest and permanent detention -without trial- "for duration of hostilities". That potential is already federal law, signed by Obama.
