<comment>And what about the people who used to live and work along Hillcroft?   If they had wanted to live in Pakistan or Mexico they would have moved there.Their neighborhoods are long gone, replaced by a third-world "panoply."I'm not a Trump fan, but I definitely understand why he has gained in popularity.</comment>

<comment>Do you live in the area or are you just spouting off about the neighborhoods along Hillcroft?  I live right off of Hillcroft in Houston and my area doesn't feel like the third-world.  I like the diversity.</comment>

<comment>I live right off of Hillcroft and my area doesn't feel like the third-world.  Of course some areas "off Hillcroft" are nice.  It's a long road.I like the diversity.What's your favorite part of the diversity?  The 18 people living in two-bedroom apartments with foil on the windows?  Or the run-down strip centers with their pawn shops and check-cashing places?</comment>

<comment>There are other choices besides Dems and Repubs. Perhaps if the media spent more time covering third parties they could get some traction and the media would be more interesting. I'm already bored with the constant harping from the "front runners". I guess you could say that The Atlantic is in the pocket of the establishment.</comment>

<comment>'“There are so many well-trained and well-educated immigrants who should be allowed to be here,” Virani said.'Wow, I am used to hearing such sense of entitlement from a certain group but when an Indian says it... We do need to change our immigration system and allow people who help this economy but also its social fabric.</comment>
