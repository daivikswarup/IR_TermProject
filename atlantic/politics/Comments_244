<comment>Activists are loathe to do the reality check.LGBT - which of these letters is not like the other? Lesbian and gay folk strongly tend to be gender essentialists, and because of that, the transgender caboose has always and will always feel like it's meant for a different gauge of track than the rest of the cars on that train. It seems many transgender activists are aware of this to varying degrees, but are in denial about the likelihood that shaming LG activists will successfully change that reality (shaming produces short-term, tactical results, but deepens the problem longer-term).Activist groups, wanting to maximize their contributions and also because having a new dimension for a cause helps with self-perpetuation (cough), have a strong confirmation/selection bias problem in seeing this reality.</comment>

<comment>Lol, what now ?</comment>

<comment>an opposition campaign that successfully employed fear tactics Much worse than the name-calling and slurs that proponents of the measure used, right?But Burke worries that the high levels of turnout among religious right-wing voters that helped defeat the proposal last November will be a factor this November, too. She "worries" that American citizens will do their civic duty and vote??</comment>

<comment>Absolutely much worse. The fear tactics were based on lies. The "name calling" was based on truth. The opponents of HERO were and are transphobes and bigots.</comment>

<comment>The opponents of HERO were and are transphobes and bigotsI rest my case.</comment>

<comment>When intelligent arguments cannot be made then name-calling is typically employed. It's a cheap tactic but often effective nonetheless. The name-calling in this situation was largely based on fear and anger on both sides. The truth had a tough time being heard.</comment>

<comment>I have given a succinct reason to oppose the initiative above because it mandates unisex bathrooms.  Without a "test" anyone of any sex of any style of dress or appearance can use any bathroom or locker room they desire and cant be questioned about it.I dont consider a values issue bigotry.  If transphiliacs find a way to address that issue satisfactorily then you might get more support</comment>

<comment>Yes. This subjective criterion that the individual gets to decide without question what he/she is, makes it a non-starter for most women.</comment>

<comment>they should have found a GAY BAKER and tried to get a straight cakeand then sued them</comment>

<comment>The African-American community also tends to be fairly religious, which can cause them to view gay rights as something very different from (and often lesser than) their own civil rights struggle. If they feel the LGBT community has not been a reliable ally in their current struggles, it's worth pointing out that the LGBT community has been given little reason in the past to view themselves as automatic allies. To be gay and to be black are not the same--indeed, gay African-Americans face unique challenges--and it does not logically follow that either group has anything to gain by supporting the other. Hopefully the Houston activists will take this into account during their next push.</comment>

<comment>Gays, fa**ots, and N*GGERS are all sub-human.</comment>

<comment>I live in Houston and here is the bottom line on the issue. This whole initiative was pushed by our former mayor who is lesbian. That unseemly fact aside, the citizens in this city, both Dems and Repubs, simply felt that the same civil rights laws that protect those not in the LGBT community are sufficient to protect those who are. No need to make this issue more complicated than it is and no need for preferential protection. It's that simple.Houston does not have a problem and we are not a bigoted city. Quite the opposite. My gosh, we elected a lesbian mayor...twice! But we do have a nose for bad smells, and this initiative was quite obnoxious.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you are a bigot that just hasn't figured it out yet.</comment>

<comment>"Bigot - a person who is obstinately or intolerantly devoted to his or her own opinions and prejudices; especially, one who regards or treats the members of a group (as a racial or ethnic group) with hatred and intolerance."Just curious, where in my comments did you see bigotry, or is that your default response to those who do not agree with you?</comment>

<comment>"Bigot - a person who doesn't fall 100% in leftist lockstep."</comment>

<comment>Spoonie Gee,You're probably not far from the truth. On a more serious note however, I do get irritated at how this word is thrown around with little regard to what it truly means or whether the shoe actually fits. In my experience, it's used primarily as a tool to shame people for believing a certain way and shut down the debate. In the real world that tactic is called cowardice.I enjoy debating the issues of our day, and I don't claim to be infallible, not by a long shot. And I hate bigotry as it's rightly defined. But I'll not be shut up by anyone, on the left or right, no matter how ugly they get.Peace.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you need a progressive re-education.  I recommend Ta Nehisi Coates.</comment>

<comment>Very familiar with him. Your apparent admiration of Mr. Coates tells me that you are safely settled on the far, far, far left end of the political and social spectrum. To each his own, but not my cup of tea, thank you.</comment>

<comment>I think he's being sarcastic. I know of very few people who would use the word "re-education" to refer to anything other than quasi-Stalinist brainwashing.  On top of that, Coates is really the bottom of the barrel for leftist thought on here, almost a punchline.  Poe-Sense says: just trollin'.</comment>

<comment>Sh*t. At first I thought you were being sarcastic.</comment>

<comment>Then maybe bigotry isnt such a bad thing, hm?</comment>

<comment>didn't that lesbian mayor try to review SERMONS ?sounds like a TOTALITARIAN FREAK</comment>

<comment>Indeed, there was an attempt by the city attorney, who works for the mayor, to subpoena sermons from certain local pastors. The community backlash was swift.</comment>

<comment>She tried. But we Houstonians, and Texans in general, made all our high office positions basically toothless, and thank God for that.</comment>

<comment>Yep. It's called freedom.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, how is the fact of the mayor's sexual orientation unseemly? Her being a lesbian means she shouldn't advocate for LGBT rights? That's ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>I wonder what the suicide and homelessness rates have to be before people realize that encouraging someone in the belief that their body is bad and that they are not their "true" self without inflicting hormonal imbalances on themselves and living in the closet pretending to be the opposite sex is usually not a good idea?As far as making an exception to Title IX for them to be allowed in female only spaces involving nudity...The majority of the current transgender "women" do not actually have classic transsexualism, they have tranvsestic fetishism and are mostly heterosexual.  And they have a considerably elevated rate of sex offenses.  This is the main reason there are so many more MTF transgender people than FTM because females don't get transvestic fetishism.</comment>

<comment>Ray Blanchard lays this out in his analysis of autogynephilia.</comment>

<comment>Yes it is in the DSM</comment>

<comment>Here's the thing.  A lot of people are onboard with gay rights.  Far fewer people are on board with transgendered rights.  Lumping all those people together under the mantle of LGBT doesn't undo this fact.</comment>

<comment>But that's a secret that goes against the narrative. Many gay people would rather the acronym stopped at LG.</comment>

<comment>If you believe the transgender narrative then all gay people are transgenderIt is gay conversion therapy in many cases.  Fetish fantasy fulfillment in the others</comment>

<comment>Honestly i believe most bisexuals would prefer it stop at LG too lol.  Few of us have anything in common with bull dykes and flamers lol.  We rarely associate with them.</comment>

<comment>Particularly lesbians it seems. I've read more than a few blogs where they despise males transitioning to female.</comment>

<comment>that's probably it</comment>

<comment>Laws like these were necessary at certain times in American history due to blatant and widespread discrimination at the time, most notably for black people after the Civil Rights movement. The acceptance of gays in this country has largely occurred without legislation. There is no evidence of systematic and widespread employment discrimination against gays in Houston. The only people that will gain anything from this is lawyers. The government needs to get less involved with businesses, not the other way around.</comment>

<comment>The article is all about advocating systematic discrimination against gay peopleThey are castrating  young gay boys in order to turn them into girls.</comment>

<comment>What is clear is that if you disagree with me it is clear you are full of hate. There is no room for any opinion or perspective different than mine. </comment>

<comment>Leading with Trans rights is a recipe for failure.  They're a very small and stigmatized community which can't carry the load, and shouldn't be asked to do so. Also, it will fracture the movement.  </comment>

<comment>they can't even figure out which bathroom to use,and they are allowed to VOTE ????</comment>

<comment>This is a LGBT "problem" in that the progressive mindset is entirely dismissive/tonedeaf to the tenants of a 2,000-year-old religion. Using the "-phobia" and "bigot" handle to adress the metaphysics of Christianity will come back to haunt the movement.The "everyone who disagrees with me is a bigot" mindset isn't useful in approaching reality or dealing with other mindsets.</comment>

<comment>It is entirely dismissive to the practical results that any person can use any facility regardless of their appearance if "LGBT rights" passes.It essentially mandates unisex bathrooms and locker rooms although I will agree that was not the LGBT intent to do so.Oh and leave us bisexuals out of it.  Most I know dont support unisex bathrooms without a vote.  If LGBT loses too bad.</comment>

<comment>"the progressive mindset is entirely dismissive/tonedeaf to the tenants of a 2,000-year-old religion"Even a Two Million year old religion would be invalid as a basis for our laws.</comment>

<comment>Genital mutilation is not opposed by the bible and many christian leaders strongly support transsexualism such as Pat Robertson.  They view it as gay conversion therapyIn Iran they force 1/2 of all homosexual couples to get a sex change because in their minds it makes them women and no longer gay</comment>

<comment>The last sentence, you're absolutely correct.  The first one, though, seems to be kind of a preemptive non-sequitur.  American governance is achieved by the consent of the governed.  Religious tenets are utterly irrelevant, because we have no preference in our government for one religion over any other, and religious tenets from different religions are frequently mutually exclusive.  It doesn't matter how many religious tenets our laws ignore or which ones - our laws are our laws, human law, made by humans for humans.  What people believe God's law is is their individual business.</comment>

<comment>F*ck off LGBTQfuckall people. Leave Houston alone. We are a Democrat majority city that just elected another black Democrat after having a LESBIAN mayor. F*ck off, we are open minded as f*ck, and the most multicultural city in the nation to boot. Homosexuals are treated fine here. Everyone is treated fine here, as long as you don't whine like a little b*tch and work hard.The recent, laughably named HERO ordinance was basically LGBTQwhatever agitprop. It was defeated, soundly, by Democrats. What say you now?</comment>

<comment>Go enjoy a drink at the GasLamp -- if they let you in.</comment>

<comment>You drink at Gas Lamp, that overpriced, yuppie (is that still the correct term? I know it isn't hipster) heaven BS? I prefer milling about in The Heights, or East End. Hell, I enjoy Monstrose as well. The homosexuals did some good work to that part of town.</comment>

<comment>"LGBT rights" are not likely to pass soon since it is essentially mandating unisex bathrooms and locker rooms.If you question LGBT advocates closely they resist any "test" such as having to look or dress like the gender you claim to be. An obvious guy dressed as a guy can use the ladies' facilities under "LGBT rights."I think that is clearly something that should be a vote of the people.  LGBT lost.  Move on.</comment>

<comment>Guess you're okay with someone checking out your junk before getting to use the "right" restroom...</comment>

<comment>I think the way things work now is just fine.  Nobody does a junk test but if you look and dress like a guy the police are likely to be called.Dont ask.  Dont tell.  If you are a guy using the lady's facilities you better look the part lol</comment>

<comment>Bathrooms are not the governments concern.</comment>

<comment>L and G, drop the B and T. The B is lying and T is insane.</comment>

<comment>"The B is lying"How do you figure?</comment>

<comment>If you're a dude that likes the D you're gay.</comment>

<comment>Sure..unless you're bisexual.</comment>

<comment>Nope.</comment>

<comment>Bisexual women are just playing at being gay, and bisexual men are just playing at being straight.</comment>

<comment>How little you know lol.  But that is funny so plus one</comment>

<comment>Female sexuality is not as physically based.  Women get impressed by someone and fall for them.  They can fall for a woman.   This also applies to a lot of the 30 year old trophy wives who marry 60 year olds.  Some are just in it for money but some are notBisexual men can be either homosexuality or fetishism.  Males "imprint" part of their sexuality which is known as a fetish.  Most men develop normal ones like breasts but it can be for anything.   If a man develops a fetish for something male or for submissiveness during sex it can result in bisexuality.  This is how you get married men with children who don't set of "gaydar" in any way getting caught with a male prostitute.  They are heterosexual, but they have a fetish for something male or submissiveAnyone could be bisexual.   The same instinct that pushes me away from sexual attraction to men applies to women with leg and armpit hair which was clearly learned.  I get the same feeling of revulsion from both.   But I could get over it or learn it differently in the first place given the proper environment.  Humans are made to adapt</comment>

<comment>Bisexuality is a sexual orientation just like homosexuality and heterosexuality. Bisexuality, whether actual or perceived, has been part of the definition of "sexual orientation" in anti-discrimination ordinances going back to 1971.  There is no reason to question the inclusion of B.  T, on the other hand, refers not to sexual orientation, but to an amorphous concept called "gender identity" which is distinct and independent from sexual orientation.  There is no logical reason to include gender identity in legislation dealing with sexual orientation.</comment>

<comment>“Transphobia within the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community exists,” says Monica Roberts, the author of the TransGriot blog.I'm glad the article is pointing out that homosexuals tend to have very strong proclivities toward sameness.  Diversity is not something that they gravitate toward. They seem to be very prejudiced and discriminatory towards opposite opinions and opposite genders. Narcissistic even.</comment>

<comment>Gender dysphoria in childhood is commonly the result of abuse(1,2), bad parenting(3), or an otherwise bad environment  in conjunction with the normal "gender variance" observed in homosexuals(4). They can develop a wide range of serious psychiatric problems some preceding gender dysphoria and some as a result of gender dysphoria(5,6). The good news is that with proper counseling the vast majority of children with gender dysphoria will overcome it, accept themselves and their body for who they are, and usually end up being just homosexual or bisexual(7).There is another population of largely heterosexual male to female transgender people who were not abnormally feminine in childhood and developed it later in life. These are called autogynephiles and have a different condition entirely that is a variant of transvestic fetishism. This is the main reason why there are so many more males with gender dysphoria than females(8,9,10).The "sexual reassignment" methods of treatment used in many clinics have not been shown to be clinically effective(11,12) and long term outcomes of these patients have been poor(13) with suicide(14), homelessness(15), serious drug addiction(16), and crime(17,18) being much more common. . Additionally this treatment is physically harmful and can cause serious health problems besides just the obvious sterilization and mood swings(19,20).Encouraging someone in the belief that their body is bad,that they are not their true self without changing something or that the clothes they wear are part of their basic identity is not a good idea in most cases. While it can be difficult due to defense mechanisms like narcissistic rage(21) especially in the autogynephilic transgender population(22), encouraging the belief that it is ok to be both feminine and male at the same time is the better strategy.1. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu...2. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi...3. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu...4. http://www.drdoughaldeman.com/...5. http://ajp.psychiatryonline.or...6. http://www.sciencedirect.com/s...7. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu...8. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pu...9. http://www.annelawrence.com/au...10. http://www.ifge.org/?q=DSM-5/3...11. http://www.theguardian.com/soc...12. http://www.wsj.com/articles/pa...13. http://journals.plos.org/ploso...14. http://williamsinstitute.law.u...15. http://www.nhchc.org/wp-conten...16. http://www.asianjournalofpsych...17. http://www.jaapl.org/content/1...18. http://www.jaapl.org/content/4...19. http://brazjurol.com.br/januar...20. http://press.endocrine.org/doi...21. http://www.iiav.nl/ezines/web/...22. http://link.springer.com/artic...</comment>

<comment>I worry about these parents who want to have the attention and be the poster family for transgender rights.  My young kids liked to pretend they were cats some times.  Should I rush out and buy cat treats and cat toys for them and encourage it?  </comment>

<comment>We can actually say that someone does not have the brain of a cat, though.Can you prove that a transgendered individual doesn't have the brain of the opposite sex?</comment>

<comment>That is irrelevant to my concern that some parents for whatever reason rush to cross dress their kid without perhaps considering a go slow approach.  Fortunately it seems rare.</comment>

<comment>Why would a fault in the comparison that YOU made be irrelevant to you?</comment>

<comment>There isnt any really good evidence that young kids who say they are the opposite sex have brain changes.   I am sure you will cite a few small poorly designed studies that you really dont have the expertise to critique though lol.I am not saying they dont have brain changes either.  Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.  I just advocate a go slow approach to young kids.</comment>

<comment>That's not what I said.You're comparing a gender dysphoria to a species dysphoria.We CAN prove that a kid does not have a brain that would be more fitting inside a cats body.So...for the comparison to hold, to be able to pretend that a gender mismatch is equivalent to a species mismatch, youd have to be able to show that it's *not* possible that the kid DOES have a brain that would be more fitting inside the opposite genders body.</comment>

<comment>You are assuming there is always a gender mismatch if a kid says he or she wishes he were the opposite sex</comment>

<comment>No, I am not.I am saying, for your comparison to be true..to be able to dismiss it as being as silly as thinking they're a cat..You'd have to show that it's impossible.We can show that the cat-brain is impossible.</comment>

<comment>There are no consensus accepted differences between young kids who express a possibly transient wish to be the opposite sex, a kid who is truly transgender, and a kid who expresses a desire to be his anatomically assigned sex.  So it matters not what analogy i use if there are no generally scientifically accepted differences among these brains. My kids' brains do not look like cat brains.  A kid who expresses a wish to be a different gender does not look like a transgender brain either.</comment>

<comment>"A kid who expresses a wish to be a different gender does not look like a transgender brain either"I think you're confusing "we know that this isn't possible" and "we haven't confirmed it".It's not the same thing.We could easily and concretely prove that a person does not have the brain of a different species.I know, I know, you don't like the science, but there are suggestions and reasons to believe that the brains of transgendered individuals have a gender/sex conflict. I'm not claiming the science is proven, so don't even bother trying to make me prove it. It doesn't need to be a consensus, it only needs to be a *possibility* in order to negate your dismissal. </comment>

<comment>I agree the science isnt there yet.  That is what makes me nervous about parents who rush into cross dressing  their young kids so as  to be the poster children and pioneers in the latest fashionable struggle of the left.  Fortunately those types of parents are likely rare</comment>

<comment>I agree that they need to at least wait until puberty, but...That doesn't mean that you can just dismiss the idea that many of these kids could have true gender dysphoria. Some kids turn out to not actually have a mismatch and are just confused by gender roles, but some do not...and dismissing that fact is just intellectually dishonest and/or naive.</comment>

<comment>I never dismissed it but munchausen by proxy takes many forms and it has appeared to me some of the parents of young kids have been all too eager to become the poster family.  Conversely there are also the parents who disown the kid which is not a good response either</comment>

<comment>You compared it to a kid thinking they're a cat.If that's not dismissive, I don't know what is.</comment>

<comment>That can be a real condition as wellIt is called clinical lycanthropyThere are infact many adults who live as catsHere is an examplehttp://nymag.com/following/201...</comment>

<comment>We need cat rights and government mandated litter boxes at public accommodations.   you are a bigot and transfelinephobic if you disagree with me</comment>

<comment>Do you not understand the distinction I'm making?</comment>

<comment>Not reallyBoth are delusions and both can result in them harming their body and social prospectsFeminine males are not female nor can they become female thorough surgery</comment>

<comment>How can you prove it's a delusion?They aren't saying "I am physically a male"..they're saying "I am physically a male but I feel like I should be a female".</comment>

<comment>We can prove it is a delusion because after all possible treatments are concluded they will have exactly 0% female body partsIf they did need to match their body to their brain this did not accomplish it in any way.  The fact that many claim to be full women after having it done is proof that they were delusional.</comment>

<comment>Again...They are not saying "I have the body of a man". That's obviously not true.They are saying "I have the body of a man but I feel like it should be the body of a woman".How would you prove that they don't actually have the brain of a woman and the body of a man? How can you prove that there's not a conflict between the two?</comment>

<comment>Again....What does any of that have to do with your advocacy of the psychiatric treatment of altering their body?Despite what people like you might have told them they don't need to do any of this.  It is ok to be a feminine male and they can not become female</comment>

<comment>Can you prove that they don't have a conflict between sex and gender?</comment>

<comment>AgainWhat would that have to do with your advocacy of altering their body?  They can not become female</comment>

<comment>You called it a delusion.How can you say it's a delusion if you can't prove that what they're saying isn't true?</comment>

<comment>Their belief that they must alter themselves is a delusion.This is not in dispute by anybody except for idiots.</comment>

<comment>So..you're agreeing that a person who says they have a conflict between sex and gender isn't necessarily delusional?</comment>

<comment>Yes homosexuals display cross gender behaviorThat's how "gaydar" worksWhat does that have to do with a delusional belief that they must alter their body?</comment>

<comment>I'm not talking about homosexuals.</comment>

<comment>Yes you are in most cases, you just don't realize it.Transsexuals are either self hating homosexuals or transvestic fetishistsHave you ever noticed how gay men are kind of like women psychological and gay women kind of like men?</comment>

<comment>Yup, you're right. Gender dysphoria is exactly the same as homosexuality and you're obviously better understanding of it than the actual people who go through these things or deal with them as their job.Thanks for educating me.</comment>

<comment>This is the consensus of the APA and every other non advocacy group.Early onset gender dysphoria is about homosexualityLate onset is about transvestic fetishismDespite what you have come to believe nobody is born destined to get cosmetic surgery.  This is an acquired condition.  If you were born feral and never exposed to other humans you would never develop gender dysphoria no matter how abnormally masculine or feminine your brain is</comment>

<comment>Yes. I'm so glad you were here to tell me that gender dysphoria is just a fetish. I'm sure the DSM-5 is just wrong, you should probably go correct them.</comment>

<comment>This is in the DSM, although obviously they don't state it as clearly as I did for political reasons"Adolescents and adults with late-onset gen­der dysphoria frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. The majority of these individuals are gynephilic (males attracted to females) or sexually attracted to other post transition natal males with late-onset gender dysphoria. A substantial percentage of adult males with late-onset gender dysphoria cohabit with or are married to natal females. After gen­der transition, many self-identify as lesbian."- American Psychiatric Association: Diagnostic and Statisti­cal Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Editionhttps://www.glad.org/uploads/d...Here is a more comprehensive clinical guide used by psychiatristshttp://www.annelawrence.com/au...Bruce Jenner is an example of late onset gender dysphoria as a result of transvestic fetishism</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that doesn't actually say that it's the same as homosexuality. It's only discussing the correlation.</comment>

<comment>Do you not understand that (true) homosexuals have cross gender behavior?Again your belief that someone is biologically destined to perform changes to their body invented in the 20th century is nonsensical.  These are merely tools to treat social anxiety and depression</comment>

<comment>Do you understand that sexual orientation and gender identity are different things?</comment>

<comment>YesI just explained it to youEarly onset  is usually about homosexuality (sometimes child abuse)Late onset is about fetishismGender identity is a nonsense term and is learned behavior.  .  If you were born feral and never exposed to other humans you would never develop gender dysphoria no matter how abnormally masculine or feminine your brain is.  You would have no concept of gender or being different</comment>

<comment>Okay..so gender is all a social construct or some other random crap like that.Good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>Sex changes are a social constructBeing a feminine male or masculine female is not</comment>

<comment>Yes. That's all that's involved in gender. Thanks for explaining that to me.</comment>

<comment>So, if someone says they see unicorns, I have to prove they don't before I can say it's a delusion?</comment>

<comment>If there's not an actual reason to believe that what they're saying is incorrect...like the fact that no unicorn has ever been shown to exist?</comment>

<comment>That's a circular argument. Is there any person who ever claimed to be a man in a woman's body or the other way around who was not delusional? We're back to square one.</comment>

<comment>It's not circular in the slightest.It just speaks to what level of proof you need to be able to claim that someone is delusional.</comment>

<comment>OK. What's the proof you have that they aren't?</comment>

<comment>I never claimed that they weren't.It's entirely possible, with all the evidence we have, that all transgendered individuals throughout history were delusional.It's also possible that they are really aliens that can't figure out how to work their disguises.You can't prove either of those otherwise...but if you want to claim that someone is delusional, some level of evidence really needs to be met.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't make any sense. Forget it. You're too dumb.</comment>

<comment>Yup, you're right.You don't understand the concept of proving a negative, so I'm super dumb.</comment>

<comment>You're the one saying that I have to prove someone is delusional when they believe in a false idea, the very definition of delusional.</comment>

<comment>Sure, I know the concept of proving a negative is confusing. </comment>

<comment>Q.E.D.</comment>

<comment>That was your point? You were trying to prove that proving a negative is confusing?</comment>

<comment>Does that gal claim to have inspired Andrew Webber Lloyd's musical?</comment>

<comment>I compared the parent rushing in to cross dress their young kid quickly, after the kid  saying he or she is the opposite sex, to me rushing out and buying cat toys for my kid who wishes to be a cat.</comment>

<comment>If you say so...It seemed to me like you were effectively saying that a kid thinking they're a different gender is comparable to a kid thinking they're a different species.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes it may be.  So why rush it?</comment>

<comment>How is believing that you should be a different sex compare in the slightest to believing that you should be a different species?Just in case you didn't recall...I agreed that we should wait until after puberty and let a doctor decide whether intervention is acceptable at that point.</comment>

<comment>Every time some kid says he wishes he were the opposite sex it signifies that kid is transgender?  That seems to be what you are saying.</comment>

<comment>Not at all..Why do you think I'm agreeing that doctors should be involved?</comment>

<comment>Lol.  I would not let doctors certify it. This guy is pissed a doctor chopped it off and made him a girl.http://www.msn.com/en-us/healt...Once someone is 18 and able to make their own decisions then go for it.  It is a personal decision, but I dont advocate taxpayers pay for it.  Fund your lifestyle with your own money.</comment>

<comment>Yep, some doctors suck.Who else should decide? You?</comment>

<comment>The person can decide to have surgery or hormonal therapy themselves once they hit 18.  Just like any cosmetic surgery the same rules should apply. Insurance shouldnt be paying for it.</comment>

<comment>I agreed, repeatedly, that they need to wait until after puberty or until they are an adult.I've even taken it up a step and said that a doctor needs to help them make the decision.Now you're just moving the goal posts and adding a "it's only cosmetic" idea? Hilarious.</comment>

<comment>Lol.  I dont think i moved the goalposts.  I consider gender reassignment to be a personal choice someone can make when they are old enough to make decisions but it is in essence a cosmetic surgery.  I support both your right to chop and shape any of your body parts and I also support your right to pay for it lol.I admit i am not the most militant transgender rights person you might find.  I support your right to do what you want with your own body, or snorkel, or play basketball.  I just believe you should buy your own equipment.   Not sure how someone's right to change their body or play basketball or drive a car becomes my or society's responsibility to pay for it </comment>

<comment>It's no more cosmetic than any other treatment for mental issues.</comment>

<comment>Even if they have "true" dysphoria I fail to see how your treatment method is a good idea</comment>

<comment>So..if their doctor says that he considers it to be a good treatment option...</comment>

<comment>You should find a better doctorThe outcomes for these patients are dismalIt is not unusual for treatments for depression to be ineffective and not based on science.  Psychiatry has a lot of pseudoscience in it.  To this day electroshock therapy still outperforms zoloft in clinical trials</comment>

<comment>The outcomes are better than the outcomes of the people who don't get treatment at all.Who are you to decide that you know better than their doctors? Do you have a medical degree?</comment>

<comment>No not at allThe 80% of children who overcome their dysphoria and accept themselves (usually as homosexual) have much better outcomes and there is no real evidence in support of these treatmentsThe ones who follow through with it have terrible statistical outcomeshttp://www.theguardian.com/soc... http://www.wsj.com/articles/pa...http://journals.plos.org/ploso...</comment>

<comment>I guess you'll just have to take it up with the doctors who agree with the treatment.After all, a few articles means you obviously understand it better than them.</comment>

<comment>Yes I do have a better understanding than most "doctors" who specialize in sex changes.  They are a pretty ignorant and ideologically driven group and their patients have terrible outcomesThe inventors of transsexualism were literally pedophilia advocateshttp://www.thepublicdiscourse....</comment>

<comment>Yup. I'm sure you do.</comment>

<comment>I guess if you want to look the other way while these patients are killing themselves in huge numbers that's on youI suppose you can pretend that you are moral for itDo you support all psychiatric treatments this way?</comment>

<comment>Yup, I'm immoral, you understand things better than doctors.</comment>

<comment>Yes you are immoral for advocating genital mutilation to depressed gay children</comment>

<comment>Of course, I'm just an evil liberal and I love nothing more than to make sure that as many children get mutilated as possible.I'm sure you learned about people like me when you went to med school.</comment>

<comment>Whatever you have to tell yourself</comment>

<comment>I think that's a bit backwards.I'm just making it simple for you, you seem like the type of person who needs to boil things down to "them bad, me good".."other people stupid, me smart".</comment>

<comment>The advocates very much have an agenda and "talk their book" if we can use financial lingo.There is big money in becoming well known in gender reassignment surgery and the hours are great.  Standard cosmetic surgery is getting a bit crowded and no one does hospital surgery and takes unassigned call if they can find any possible way to avoid it.  The lifestyle is horrible.</comment>

<comment>I think  that some homosexuals do probably have a tiny part of their brain like the opposite sex.  Hence the cross gender behavior observed by "gaydar"Not sure what that has to do with your advocacy of genital mutilation, hormonal imbalances  and having them live in the closet pretending to be something they are not for the rest of their lives thoughDespite what you have been telling them it is ok to be both feminine and male at the same time.</comment>

<comment>As long as biological essentialism is the major argument in favor of trans rights, it will be a losing issue.  The argument alienates those who are the most likely allies of members of the trans community.</comment>

<comment>I pretended I was a dog, and particularly, a horse. My parents were puppeteers and I pretended I was a marionette. Trying on identities is one of the many things kids do. I also wanted to be a rancher and a fireman. Sure, offer them "cat treats," but ones that are o.k. for kids. and cat toys if you want. It is play. It is o.k. for adults to play too.Yes, I was glad that I came along when it was o.k. for little girls to wear shorts and jeans, although we still had special bikes. I probably did want to be a little boy sometimes, and not have to wear those Mary Jane shoes that pinched and the starched ruffles that scratched. Wouldn't you?I agree with you about parents pushing kids to settle on another gender. What I feel may be seen by others as wrong, but, even though I fully support the young people I see moving toward being gay (don't know any that I know are moving toward being trans) I ache for them because it is such a hard road.</comment>

<comment>Link 3 has relevance to your argumentMany mothers of transgender boys have borderline personality disorder and basically push them into it in the same way that some mothers push their daughters into beauty pagentsAnd link 7 shows most grow out if you let them</comment>

<comment>We have one of those in Norway. Born in the wrong species. She identifies as a cat. https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>I worked most of my career in Houston and know three fine people who transitioned to a new gender. I am told that it is usually recommended that they change jobs at the attire-change point of their transition. So, I knew one after, one before, and since my workplace was so o.k. with it, one all the way through.  I am sure not all of Houston is so accepting.In my mind, the TV ad changed the vote on this. It was very dramatic. It is probably on YouTube if you want to see it.From my small sample of the gender-changed, and much larger sample of gay men, I would venture to say that little girls are more at risk from a different segment of the population. Wouldn't it be so easy to cross-dress if you wanted to expose yourself to a little girl in a restroom?And yet, the only event I know of in which a little girl was victimized in a public restroom in Houston occurred in a large department store I used to go to. As I remember it, a woman let her little girl go to the restroom near where she was shopping. A man entered the restroom, dressed as a man. The store had a corridor used by men and women to go to the restrooms withing the corridor. He probably used ether or chloroform to sedate her, and carried her out "asleep" nestled against his shoulder. Fortunately this was back in the days when stores had staff, and he was caught inside the store.So, the ad seemed to me to be a red herring, but it was very scary, and it worked. It came on too close to the vote for the supporters to have any chance to unpack the message of the ad and counter it, not that this would have been a good idea anyway.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for contributing.  Do you happen to have a link to the news story on the attempted abduction?</comment>

<comment>It was a loong time ago -- the seventies or early eighties. Houston Public Library probably has the paper index to either the Houston Post of the Chronicle with the story.</comment>

<comment>So why is Terri so ashamed to say homosexual and cover up her embarrassment with letters?</comment>

<comment>There is no such thing as "LGBT."  No matter how many times it gets tossed around, it does not reflect reality.  "LGBT" was concocted in the 1990s by transgender activists and certain radical LGB academics.  Trans activists saw it as a way to co-opt the LGB rights movement and the academics saw it as a way to ensure that the gay movement did not go mainstream.  No one is obligated to recognize this sham concept.  As a gay man, I wasn't "reeling" at the Houston defeat because it was obvious that the outcome was not driven by anti-LGB sentiment, but by reasonable concerns regarding transgender demands concerning the regulation of private spaces.  It is insane for gay leaders to continue to insist that these very different issues all be crammed down the throats of voters and legislatures as one take-it-or-leave-it package.  The only reason it is done this way is because trans activists demand it.  The sane approach would be to enact protections for all Houstonians from discrimination based on sexual orientation and to allow the transgender activist demands to be considered separately and on their own merits.</comment>

<comment>I think the real issue is less 'bigotry' and more 'apathy.' Which is to say that while people may not be AGAINST equal rights for LGBT citizens, they just don't care ENOUGH about them to do anything to support them. And it's not just LGBT rights: Texas' districts are so ridiculously gerrymandered that there's basically no chance for the Democrats to win state representation. Even in Austin, supposedly a liberal bastion, the districts are entirely warped to elect a conservative to the State House.But, at the same time, there's cheap land and BBQ to be had, so why rock the boat?(The answer, of course, is that it's the right thing to do, but people suck, and they'd rather do the right thing for THEM at the time, versus the right thing OVERALL.)Mind you, I don't think this is a Texas-exclusive problem, though I do think the apathy situation favors the New South and the Sunbelt. Georgia just past sweeping "religious freedom" laws, despite Atlanta's openness and probably BECAUSE of Atlanta's apathy. Florida, my home state, is poised to make similar measures (to say nothing of draconian abortion legislation on the books,) and really, Florida is basically like the gayest state on the planet...and certainly the one where abortion clinics should be open 24/7, like 7-11.So, it's a larger issue than just Houston, or Texas, or bigots who care a lot about the other side of this equation. It's everyone who looks the other way in order to not rock the boat and upset the apple cart. And keep on keeping' on.</comment>

<comment>Can't help Houston with its issues.   But, just musing the other day, it occurred to me that, after the political dust settles , and everyone still needs a place to go, single restrooms could easily serve all. Cubicles for everybody.</comment>

<comment>There are already National laws in place for these items listed below, why is a "local" law needed also?Last November, voters here rejected an equal-rights ordinance—the Houston Equal Rights Ordinance, or HERO—that would have prevented employers and landlords from discriminating against people for a number of reasons, sexual orientation and gender identity among them.</comment>

<comment>What national laws prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation?</comment>

<comment>For employment: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (Title VII)This law makes it illegal to discriminate against someone on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex</comment>

<comment>Looks like this would cover anything else. Equality Act of 2015:Amends the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity among the prohibited categories of discrimination or segregation in places of public accommodation.https://www.congress.gov/bill/...</comment>

<comment>It would, if it becomes law.</comment>

<comment>Notice what's not there as an actionable basis for discrimination?  Sexual orientation or perceived sexual orientation.</comment>
