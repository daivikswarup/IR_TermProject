<comment>This shlemiel boasted about the Baltimore public school system during the debates.  That sums him up nicely.</comment>

<comment>O'Malley would have been a great candidate 15 or 20 years ago. But not now. His messaging never caught traction and he simply didn't have enough national recognition to really get people's attention.</comment>

<comment>why not?(genuinely curious)</comment>

<comment>It's hard to call Baltimore a success story by any metric.  He just didn't have that much going for him, aside from vaguely looking the part.</comment>

<comment>You're next, my friend.  Thanks for priming the voters for me.   I'll take over from here.</comment>

<comment>And ours.</comment>

<comment>"In May, he quoted the contemporary poet Seamus Deane on unemployment and violence to George Stephanopoulos."I know that George can come off a bit smarmy, but no one should try to hurt him.</comment>

<comment>Martin O'Who?</comment>

<comment>You don't seem to get what Tommy Carcetti's character on The Wire was all about; yes, it was based on O'Malley, but it was not a compliment. Carcetti becomes corrupted during his tenure and ends up doing the same things he campaigned against. Simon viewed O'Malley as a terrible mayor. And we was.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, he was, and he is quite unpopular in his home state. It's hard to launch a successful campaign with that kind of baggage.</comment>

<comment>Democratic voters aren't stupid.  It's asking a lot to trust a candidate who campaigns on their managerial experience, when their city is burning on live television due to the fire they left burning on its doorstep.</comment>

<comment>The lesson of Carcetti's character is that even the mayor, supposedly the top of the city government, is a slave to the political and cultural inertia of a city's institutions.  That Simon also included some personal jabs with the character is his personal beefs with O'Malley showing through.  The Wire is one man's view of things.  Take it with a grain of salt.I lived in Baltimore during O'Malley's tenure.  He really did try to make the city better.  Citistat did make the government more responsive about quality of life issues.  And he at least did try to do something about the city's unfixable crime problem when previous mayors largely tried to ignore it.His policies largely failed when he started running for Governor and left the city's management in the hands of his corrupt and incompetent successors.</comment>

<comment>Correct, the author doesn't realize Carcetti was a dis not a compliment, but he didn't become corrupted.  He was depicted as a consummate politician who would do whatever it took from the get go.</comment>

<comment>and the left loses the closest thing they have to a rationalist candidate</comment>

<comment>The failure of O'Malley's candidacy is a real loss for the Democratic party.  Instead, the party establishment went for propping-up the stale and corrupt Clinton machine and the base went for an unelectable Bolshevik.If Rubio makes it through the primaries, he wins.  Democrats had better hope it's Trump or Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  Fierce words.  However, it was the voters of Iowa that failed to support O'Malley yesterday, conspiracy theories aside.  He was never polling very high and wasn't he invited to all the debates?  As for Hillary being an "unelectable Bolshevik," that remains to be seen.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps he meant the 'Bolshevik" to refer to Bernie.</comment>

<comment>Ah yes, looking at it again, I see what you mean.  I sit corrected.  But it "still" is the people voting in the caucus that cast a vote for either Clinton or Bernie and not for O'Malley, so he wasn't getting any traction with anyone, it seems.  Bernie might well be viewed as an unelectable Bolshevik if he ends up as the democratic nominee, another George McGovern.  Only when the whole primary process runs all the way through will be know how it turns out.  I wouldn't venture a prediction who will win for either party.</comment>

<comment>At the moment based on the few polls showing Bernie and Hillary running against specific Republican candidates Bernie does better in some cases winning when Hillary loses it appears that Bernie is the more electable of the two.</comment>

<comment>Who is no more of a Bolshevik than FDR was.</comment>

<comment>mrdot: There's a grain or two of truth in what you say. O'Malley didn't have the negatives of either Clinton or Sanders and would perhaps have had a broader appeal had he been nominated. But that was never going to happen. While the Dems are not nearly as crazy as the Reps, the nominating system is not really set up to reward electability in a general election. If it happens, it may be just luck.</comment>

<comment>Who?</comment>

<comment>The minstrel boy to the war has goneIn the ranks of death you shall find himHis father's sword he has girded onHis wild harp slung behind him"Land of Song," said the warrior bard,"Though all the world betray me,""One sword at least thy rights shall guard!"One faithful harp shall play thee!"The minstrel fell but the foeman's chainCould not bring his proud soul under;The harp he bore ne'er played again,For he tore its chords asunder.He said, "No chains shall sully thee,"Thou soul of love and bravery!"Thy songs were made for the brave and free,"And shall not sound in slavery!"</comment>

<comment>Martin is a lovely man who had the grace to bow out gracefully knowing full well he was not going any further. The choice was always going to be between Hillary and Bernie. The voters will decide which of those two they prefer to be the next POTUS.</comment>

<comment>"He was an inspiration for Tommy Carcetti on The Wire, for Pete’s sake!"This is like being astonished that customers wouldn't want to visit the barber who inspired Sweeney Todd.</comment>

<comment>"the fluency with which O’Malley made reference to poetry made it hard to interpret it as a cheap campaign ploy"Possibly, except New Hampshire has a sizeable Irish population, who are largely quite fond of their roots.</comment>

<comment>I believe that O'Malley wasthe best person to be our next president.  Hillary Clinton has made itclear that she would continue the Obama/ Fat Cat Greed Monster economicdisaster, $18 trillion dollar damage.  Bernie would make a strong effortto fix our economic disaster but he does not know what cause of ourunemployment disaster or how to fix the current continuing unemploymentdisaster. Our main danger is if Plutocracy Republicans win with their basicstrategy, "Make and keep Republican Voters too stupid to know when theyare being taken.".  Their public stated goal is to eliminate everypossible Middle Class and Low Income benefit, including Social security,Minimum wage, unemployment compensation, Medicare, etc.  If I can get Martin O'Malley to talk to me immediately, I can provide to him adequate remedies and methods to make him our next President and create a labor shortage by July 2017, Jeff Goolsby, Grassroots Business and Political Economist, Ph.D.</comment>

<comment>O'Malley is a good guy and a decent governor albeit with one troublesome flaw - the City of Baltimore.Not really his fault, but that place is like a cinderblock attached to a swimmer's  ankle.He will make a fine candidate for VP.So did Spiro Agnew.</comment>

<comment>ISWYDT</comment>

<comment>We GOT CASINOS again!I remember Spiro well and the  slot machines that got banned in 1968.</comment>

<comment>One more thing that America needs to learn is that thePlutocracy Republican Fat Cat Greed monsters  have increased their control of the other 99%’smind with their deadly control of the news media.  If any news media company exposes one of theirscams, they would stop their advertising and that company would be dead.  People make decisions by believing falseinformation that the news media is forced to publish.  The cause of today’s continuing unemploymenthas no similarity to what the news media and Obama says is the cause. Check meon the Internet, Jeff Goolsby</comment>

<comment>This world will only survive if we learn to honour poetrysecond only to children,far above God, money and guns.</comment>

<comment>I would like to see more candidates like O'Malley in the center and even on the left. We need a vigorous debate on issues and not a slugfest between two people.O'Malley ran an honorable campaign, and I hope he continues to be a voice in the Democratic Party.</comment>

<comment>Everyone should actually research what the "rain tax" was supposed to accomplish.  Call me crazy, but as a native Baltimore resident, and an avid boater and fisher, I would like to see the Chesapeake Bay healthy.  Too bad no other surrounding states tried to help the health of the United State's largest estuary, and one of the most important bodies of water in the world.</comment>

<comment>The way I saw it was that Martin O'Malley reckoned he'd just hope and wait for Hillary to be indicted and placed under arrest, then knowing that Bernie Sanders could never actually win the Presidential election, he would become the Democratic nominee.Setting aside the fact that Martin O'Malley himself could never be elected POTUS, it seemd a reasonable strategy on his part.</comment>

<comment>Adios Marty.  Go back to your Libturd home base and cry.</comment>

<comment>Who?</comment>

<comment>As a Vermonter who travels often for work, it always amazes me how insular progressives here are. They believe their values exist nationwide. </comment>

<comment>progressive values exist worldwide, so callng them insular only passes muster if you limit your view. </comment>

<comment>After visiting/living in 17 countries (N&S. America,Asia, Europe, and Africa)  I found progressive values in 4 places- the USA, Canada, the EU, and Australia. Basically where people are financially secure enough to indulge in progressive causes.</comment>

<comment>As an American ex-pat living in Australia, I'd say it was progressive policies that have allowed us the indulgence of financial security.It's not a hobby or a fad or a rich man's left-wing experiment, but the way of progress. Even the US, with its heated anti-communist rhetoric, was equally shaped by Labor Unions & the Civil Rights movement that created the middle class which is under assault. </comment>
