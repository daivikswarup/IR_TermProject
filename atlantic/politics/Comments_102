<comment>"Let's put it to Obama so the people can really see where he stands on Obamacare."The GOP, unfit to govern.</comment>

<comment>He should sign it.  This would force them to repeal their own repeal when the foolishness of their endeavor sets in.</comment>

<comment>That is even stupider than passing the bill in the first place.If they want to get rid of Obamacare, then show us what they will replace it with. Very few people were happy with the situation we had before.</comment>

<comment>That's exactly why he should sign this bill.  Dropping the requirement to buy insurance, but keep the requirement that insurers can't be picky about who they cover, will make the situation much worse than it was before.The Republicans passed this as a message vote.  Call their bluff and put their message in action.  Like Pelosi said, "we have to pass it before you can 'see' what it does".</comment>

<comment>This is similar to that old cartoon of the guy sitting on a branch sawing it off at the tree. With the Republicans sawing and we're the branch. Real people would be hurt if Obamacare was killed.</comment>

<comment>Perfect analogy.</comment>

<comment>22 million w/o insurance. That's in addition to the 10-11 million still not covered. Elect Sanders and he will TRY to push for single-payer/universal. VERY easy to expand medicare to all. Except repluggedlicscum and AGW deniers.</comment>

<comment>What a choice....Choose between greedy insurance companies on one side and a completely dysfunctional government program run by useless government workers on the other.  Throw in the third element, doctors who know how to work the insurance system, and we screwed again.</comment>

<comment>What a stupid. Show me "the completely dysfunctional....", a-hole. Medicare has worked, and worked well, for decades. The fact that you conflate the for profit healthcare industry(an abomination) with Medicare and etc is either a stupid cheap trick. Or just stupid. I step on trolls. Can educate the ignorant.</comment>

<comment>Medicare worked and worked well like a credit cards work and work well until one day when the debt gets too great to manage.  Greed private sector people are no different than greedy government people with one exception, we get to choose the greed private sector people and we are just forced to pay the greedy government people.  You step on trolls but I suspect you drink in the morning.</comment>

<comment>And piss on stupid, worse than ignorant, asswipes like you. You get to choose what? More lies and bs. Greedy gov't people? You're a waste of time. One fact you can't digest along with the mouthful of crap you spew. Medicare overhead, operating costs, are 2-3%, private sector over 20%. It's called profit, stupid. And, thanks to fools like you(and the supreme court) corps. have to put profit before people.</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha......I hope for your sake that obamacare covers mental illness like  turrets syndrome and asperger's syndrome.</comment>

<comment>As long as them crosshairs hold steady, we'll be fine. Why don't you and me run over to the high desert and do a little coyote hunting in the Steens unit??? Maybe harvest some rotten oathcreeper long pork?? Eh? How "bout it there, goodbuddy?</comment>

<comment>End all government subsidies now and let all who will be hurt get it over with.</comment>

<comment>Then our economy would come to a halt over night. Whether it is car owners subsidizing the heavy truck transportation industry or taxpayers subsidizing the military industrial complex, our economy runs on subsidies.</comment>

<comment>Why does the Atlantic use an old photograph of Paul Ryan sans his bread?Employ a photographer and use a January 2016 photograph so the USA gets a real clear view of who these people are and better yet employ someone.Perhaps maybe possibly even a USA citizen</comment>

<comment>Real people were hurt when Obamacare was passed.</comment>

<comment>Not so.... Just ask all those Republicans who asked for horror stories and got nothing but push back from their constituents, do they stopped asking</comment>

<comment>There were no horror stories. Just premium increases on everyone above the median income.I'm 29 and have to buy health insurance, despite being perfectly healthy, because older people need it and poorer people cannot afford it. My pocketbook is hurt, and I resent it, but it's hardly a horror story.</comment>

<comment>Here's one of MILLIONS of horror stories:My family got premium jacked 39% on our BCBS Blue Edge PPO plan just before the 2014 election.Then we got cancelled due to Obamacare.Now we pay twice as much for the same level of coverage, and our deductible doubled.So we pay twice as much for insurance we can't use.In my state, Bcbs  no longer offers individual market PPO coverage, again because of Obamacare.So when I retire I will pay 12,000 non tax deductible dollars a year for bargain basement HMO coverage, until i can sign up for Medicare.THAT is a horror story.</comment>

<comment>Not one that is sympathetic universally. It's a horror story to me and many others, but not to those who benefited from the program. Not a sellable story to those millions.</comment>

<comment>10 million got insured through Obamacare exchanges.Another 7 million though the Medicaid expansion.Those 17 million Happy Obamacare Winners are outnumbered 3-4 to 1 by Angry Obamacare Losers.Obamacare has been an unmitigated political  disaster for Democrats, and at this point it's quite amusing to hear Obama and his minions claim "Obamacare is working" as it implodes actuarially.Obama has been desperately backpedaling, delaying, and rewriting Obamacare in the Oval Office to save Democrats' political necks, ever since his failed 2013 efforts to force almost 6 million healthy no preexisting conditions individual policy owners into his exchanges backfired, with Bill Clinton stepping in to stop the political bleeding. 100 house Democrats were set to gut  Obamacare the next day.Later that year Obam took a huge political hit to delay the employer mandate, gave up 12 billion in 2014 penalty revenue, in a failed attempt to save midterms.And it's been downhill ever since.</comment>

<comment>I call bulls hit</comment>

<comment>You can call BS, but I gave you the name of the plan, and my story is hardly uncommon.A 2 minute google search says im just one of millions of Angry Obamacare Losers who will be very motivated voters this November.Progressives  don't even consider the downside of the individual mandate in this year's election, after a few million Millennials finally caved in and bought a plan they can't afford and don't need because the penalty tax went up.They aren't exactly happy about ponying up their student loan payments to subsidize 58 year old obese Boomers' self inflicted knee replacements.More votes against Obamacare/Hillary.</comment>

<comment>So you live in a state that refused the Medicaid expansion?</comment>

<comment>The Medicaid expansion has nothing to do with the individual insurance market.All Provisions of Obamacare are designed to destroy the indiviudal markets so the Amwrican people scream for single payer.</comment>

<comment>I'm afraid it is so.Why don't you take a few minutes and read posts from all the Angry Obamacare Losers on the ACA Facebook page:https://www.facebook.Com/ilikeobamacare/You are still under the influence of Dr Jonathan Grubers and DNCs propaganda campaign. Gruber put out a bogus propaganda chart without disclosing he was paid 400k as an ACA consultant. He later bragged about hiding middle class tax hikes and devising the "mislabeled" Cadillac tax to end employer insurance and the biggest tax deduction on IRS books.His bogus chart claims only 3% of Americans would be "Obamacare Losers," while 85% of us would be unaffected, since we have employer insurance.This chart went viral on the left wing media:http://www.slate.Com/blogs/weigel/2013/10/31/the_chart_that_could_save_obamacare.htmlLater CNNs Jake Tapper found videos of Gruberhe admitting Obamacare would END employer insurance, saying the employer deduction was bad policy: http://www.cnn.Com/2014/11/13/politics/tapper-gruber/Duke economist Chris Conover claimed Obamacare Losers would outnumber Obamacare Winners 3-4 to 1. Judging from the blogosphere, I'd say Conover is telling the truth.</comment>

<comment>They do not care what people think as evidenced by the fact when they asked for horro stories from their constituents, all they got were stories of praise telling them to "leave Obamacare alone"</comment>

<comment>A friend with a large family switched to Obamacare and out of the company plan to save money.  His plan to lower his insurance costs, about $150 a month, lasted for about a year.  He now regrets his decision because his insurance is now about $150 more than the company plan and that is after the company raised our insurance costs about $200 a month.  With the window for open enrollment closed, he is screwed.It has been argued that the true cost of obamacare was hidden to let the roots grow.  Maybe that is true or maybe not, but it appears that we might be getting closer to finding out.</comment>

<comment>That argument is 100% correct.Your friend is also about to find out Obamacare premiums are not tax deductible, as employer premiums are.He's going to get a substantial tax hike for switching from Employer insurance to Obamacare.This massive tax hike is and always has been how Democrats plan to pay for subsidies, and the vehicle to achieve the end of employer insurance and the biggest tax deduction on IRS books is the Cadillac tax.It will hit 75% of ALL plans within 10 years, because it's tied to CPI.The Cadillac tax is the biggest fraud in Obamacare.Ironically it hits unions first, so Democrats just signed on to delay it until 2020 in a desperate effort to save Hillary 2016. She can't win without unions.</comment>

<comment>How about holding the Democrats to the promise they made to the American people and provide insurance to millions of people while lowering the cost for all at the same time.   That is what the Dems promised.</comment>

<comment>Democrats learned from the implosion of Hillarycare.They hired consultants to determine what the American people needed to hear, and that's what they told them.Obamacare was rammed through using a Machiavelli on Steroids campaign of bald faced lies, aided and abetted by a dysfunctional media.</comment>

<comment>Oh stop. Even Obama advisors admitted that 86% of Americans had health insurance and were happy with their coverage. A lot of those 86% lost their coverage they were happy with and now cannot afford double the cost to get back those policies.Obamacare was solely for the 10 million no to low income Americans and another 10 million immigrants. ACA will do little longterm to actually move their numbers into becoming healthy. The key is nutrition and prevention. A pack of smokes a day, a six pack, Micky Ds for the kids with soda refills, then pizza for dinner and Cheetos for after dinner snack while glaring at the tube till midnight is not going to take them on the path to health.And the GOP did put forth Burr Coburn Hatch, which was a decent start and certainly no worse than ObamaCare. </comment>

<comment>Even Obama advisors admitted that 86% of Americans had health insurance and were happy with their coverage. Nope. Caught lying again. Most Americans were unhappy with their health insurance.https://www.healthinsurance.or...But then I source my numbers, I don't pull them out my butt like the RWNJs.</comment>

<comment>I'd be impressed if they can pass a budget this year, let alone a raft of conservative think tank legislation.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't be impressed, so much as surprised.  The same kind of surprise one would have walking into a room of ambulance chasers who were able to collectively come up with an idea that would accidentally serve some sort of purpose (however ill-conceived) besides making them all more wealthy.</comment>

<comment>Budget passed. When it expires is, and will be, most interesting.</comment>

<comment>I'm referring to this year's. If they were actually doing regular order, they'd need to have some spending bills headed to committee in the next month or two. I doubt they will. Arguably, there isn't time in the year and we should move to two year appropriations. Or they should quit going on five week recess multiple times a year.</comment>

<comment>And I'm referring to what just did, and will, happen. Budget just passed is set to expire in Oct. A dbl whammy could(WILL) happen when a routine transfer of funds from SSI to SSDI will be(has been?) blocked by the reichwing. This sets up, perhaps, this cycles "October Surprise". Arguably, your solutions aren't relevant at this time bcz reality sets in and what I've outlined above is set to happen. For a whole lot more clarity on this, Hartmann expounded on this last week and it's archived there. Consider, if you will, budgetary gov't shutdown(again), uproar, millions threatened, over LOSS of benefits(people start dying) and a crazy, fucked up, election. Thanks for the opp to relate this. And thanks for looking for solutions.</comment>

<comment>I'll say this much: at least one federal agency is expecting no budget to be passed until we have a new President in the WH. Don't think there will be a shut down, but there will be a continuing resolution until at least February.</comment>

<comment>"Will those same Republicans really vote on legislation that strips health insurance for millions of people if they knew it would actually happen, particularly if they didn’t have a replacement law ready to go at the same time? "If there were any chance of this form of repeal becoming law, the entire payer and provider wings of the health care industry would be bulldozing Congress to make sure it didn't happen, because the resulting chaos in health care would be enormous and lasting.   It's still an open question in my mind whether the law can keep enough people on the insurance rolls to prevent the no-medical-underwriting provision viable, but without the mandate and subsidies, there is no hope.  2 years under the law the Republicans just passed would bankrupt most of the insurance industry.</comment>

<comment>"2 years under the law the Republicans just passed would bankrupt most of the insurance industry."If not them, then the rest of us.  This also stuck out to me:"The bill Congress has sent to the president does not repeal every word of the Affordable Care Act, and some of the important—and most popular—provisions remain intact under the legislation, including the prohibition on insurance companies discriminating against people with pre-existing conditions, and the requirement that insurers allow adult children to stay on their parents’ plans through age 26."Those cost would have to be spread across all policy holders.  Without the additional funds coming in from the Medicaid expansion and subsidies, they would be tremendous.What's amazing is the idea that we can somehow go back to the 2009 status quo.  The one both McCain and Obama ran against.  History doesn't rewind.  The insurance industry, employers, and consumers have all made significant changes in the past five years.  Undoing them all will be time consuming and expensive.  Even if you believe that the ACA was the most heinous legislation ever passed in this Nation's history, you need to develop an exit strategy for after the repeal.</comment>

<comment>An effective exit strategy: something that Republicans haven't been able to produce for healthcare, Iraq, Afghanistan...</comment>

<comment>Imagine this scenario... Obama signs the Republican's misguided wishes into law.  What would be the response from the medical business (providers, insurers, pharma)?  Will the Republicans blame Obama for the results of them exercising their power?  I think they would.When those who only purchased private insurance plans on the exchanges because it is required drop out, companies would immediately raise premiums.  The lobbyists would swarm on Congress to either reinstate the requirement for all to be insured, or drop the requirement that they cover pre-existing conditions.  All the people they have hired to handle millions of new customers,via Exchanges or administering Medicaid will be let go.Providers have been adding staff and capacity to be able to meet the demand of millions of newly insured.  When the previously insured patients stop coming in, a lot of jobs will be lost.  Not to mention, the losses on required ER treatment will start coming back to those of us with insurance - raising our premiums.Pharma will lose millions of insured customers, and cut research and jobs to maintain profits.</comment>

<comment>Obama isn't stupid enough to do something like that to just score political points. Whoopie, he threw it back in the GOP's face. But what about the millions of Americans that get screwed over and the economic downturn the resulting chaos causes?</comment>

<comment>According to the Republicans, this is what the American people want.  Signing the bill will put that to the test.</comment>

<comment>If this ever became law, insurance prices would double overnight. We would see a glut of catastrophic plans that only cover very serious medical issues that cut in after a high deductible.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  When the backlash hits, what will the Republican response be?  Will they repeal their own repeal law?  Will they try to pass a new law (that would require 60 Senate votes) to drop the requirement to cover pre-existing conditions?</comment>

<comment>haha no they'll just blame Obama for it.you actually think they'd take responsibility for anything?</comment>

<comment>One can dream... gotta go get my Powerball tix :)</comment>

<comment>And sadly their voters just go along, mindlessly. Very Orwellian... They simply seem to forget recent history and just rewrite their memories to conform.</comment>

<comment>They left in pre-existing conditions and students under 26 on parents plan. That means those that don't want insurance or can't afford it out of pocket, won't be there to cover the higher costs associated with pre-existing conditions.As it is, Obamacare has dampened the rise in health care. What is needed is control over pricing on all ends, not just the insurers. Doctors like the less hassle Obamacare payments, but would balk at seeing their wages controlled.</comment>

<comment>Bingo.  Plus going any further would require 60 votes in the Senate, so they'd just be playing in the House again for the 60th or so time.</comment>

<comment>I think most people would balk at seeing their wages controlled by the government.And I think most doctors don't like anything at all about Obamacare, especially filling out a 1040 to get paid, with lots of intentional speed bumps to prevent that from happening.</comment>

<comment>Wait... you actually expect the same people that refuse to pass a budget and cripple the government as a result to act in a responsible manner? You actually expect these people to do their job and act in the best interests of the voters that elected them? Man, you're an incurable optimist, aren't you? They've already proven they are willing to screw the American people to make political points. They've nothing to lose now by screwing them again.</comment>

<comment>And the hospitals would scream, knowing that their share of paid patients would decrease, dramatically, putting them in immediate financial jeopardy.This would be a major step toward third world status--what a horrible idea, sending the ill and diseased to debtor's prison (for being unable to pay their medical treatment debt)</comment>

<comment>That's exactly what a lot of people want. With lower premiums.27 year old triathletes are a bit peeved about ponying up student loan payments to subsidize 58 year old obese Boomers.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention keeping the preexisting condition measures but repealing the mandate is a recipe for disaster</comment>

<comment>Do many people truly think that would stop the Republicans when they're on a mission?</comment>

<comment>The mandate is a drop in the bucket on paying for guaranteed issue, especially because Democrats made it a toothless sham with the IRS able to collect it only by withholding from tax refunds.There are numerous exemptions also.The only way to possibly have guaranteed issue health care in a country with an aging population and the highest obesity rates in the industrialized world is through aggressive rationing and massive tax hikes. But Obamacare is actuarially imploding because democrats cannot implement IPAB or end employer insurance and the biggest tax deduction on IRS books without frying to a crisp at the polls.</comment>

<comment>"they can't implement the IPAB"let's not split hairs here.  They can't do that because the GOP is stonewalled the law at every turn.the ACA needs fixes and improvements(frankly i think your subsidy on the exchanges should equal what an employer would get as a tax break for offering you insurance)the biggest problems with the ACA could be fixed if the GOP were willing to accept it's not going away</comment>

<comment>Nope, sorry, the Obama administration cannot name the 15 member IPAB board because 6 years out, Obamacare is more unpopular than they EVER imagined.They can't take the political hit.They can't take the political hit for the Cadillac tax either, since it hits unions before everyone else. They've just had to delay that until 2020, which effectively guts Obamacare.I know this bill backward and forward, have stayed current ever since it was passed.Obama has been furiously backpedaling and delaying Bad Medicine Obamacare provisions in a failed attempt to save Democrats' political necks ever since Obamaacre Dump Round 1, his failed effort to force almost 6 million healthy individual policy owners into his exchanges back in 2013. He was awarded Politifacts Lie of the Year for those efforts.Not long after, he delayed the employer mandate, aka Obamacare Dump Round 2, taking a huge political hit and giving up 12 billion in 2014 penalty revenue in a failed attempt to save 2014 mid terms.</comment>

<comment>Republicans don't do "exit strategies" or "forward thinking" or "planning for the future."  They're men of action.  Poorly thought-out, badly motivated--but vigorous!--action.</comment>

<comment>Republicans, George W. in particular, appear to be working under the implicit assumption that the rapture will come soon before they are forced to face up to the long term effects of their sensational decisions today.</comment>

<comment>Simply a bill that gets us back to the old less regulated system with unbridled premium increases.  Interesting that no one talks about the Massachusetts experience where after the first five years, premium cost started and continue to drop or increase at rates much lower than the national average</comment>

<comment>"2 years under the law the Republicans just passed would bankrupt most of the insurance industry."Not possible - although when it comes to health care, it would be a good thing.If the insurance industry knows anything, it is how to make money regardless of the environment. It's been proven over and over and over again since the first insurance company started up.</comment>

<comment>As someone who has worked in the upper levels of both health care insurers and providers, I can tell you that you're simply wrong on this.   The health insurance industry has no idea how to make money in an environment where they cannot select risk, but must take all comers on a policy.   The ACA forbids risk selection at an individual level - under the ACA the industry is forced to underwrite an entire population segment.   That works if the mandate forces the entire segment to have insurance, but it fails utterly if it does not.   The Republican bill only repeals half the equation though - the mandate goes, but the group underwriting stays.   It's a recipe for disaster.  The "death spiral" for insurance plans under this scenario is real.As for "it would be a good thing" - I don't think the way health insurance is set up in this country is very smart, but the country and its citizens need and want health insurance.   It would be a good thing for the current system to be destroyed only if we're replacing it with something better - which will also be insurance, however differently administered.</comment>

<comment>Dear Iowa Beauty,You said, "The health insurance industry has no idea how to make money in an environment where they cannot select risk, but must take all comers on a policy."I'll take your word for that, but they used to do it. Have no fear, they are smart and will will learn how again.The original basis of all insurance was the idea that the larger the pool, the lower the overall risk, and the greater the profit.It worked for a very very long time to the benefit of all - insurers and insureds.Then, somone had the bright idea of increasing profits by "risk selection", as you describe it.Split out the higher risks from the rest, make them pay a whole lot more. The lower risks would pay a bit less  because lower risk insureds had fewer claims.Overall profit went sky high, and that ended adherence to the founding principle upon which all insurance was based, and which worked so well.And for even more profit, God help anyone who has a claim. Then the low risk insured goes into the high risk pool.Meanwhile, they deny your claim and/or make you wait far longer than necessary for payment. Money in their own bank earns interest, after all.I worked in IT for an immense propery and casualty company (18th largest in the world at the time). I saw it with my own eyes, at every level.Don't just believe propaganda put forth by any industry. It is your job as a citizen to look a little deeper.Warmest regards,UncleStu</comment>

<comment>"If the insurance industry knows anything, it is how to make money regardless of the environment."There were hundreds of insurer insolvencies between 1984 and 1993.  Relieance has been in a liquidation since 2001.  AM Best since 2002.  That's just a start.</comment>

<comment>"There were hundreds of insurer insolvencies between 1984 and 1993. "Stop it. You're breaking my heart. It takes real talent to screw up an insurance company.I actually worked for an immense ($18 billion/year) global insurance company (property and casualty) that went bankrupt. (I was in IT.) They deserved it - in spades.They were crooked from the top down. Their president was even indicted (don't know how that turned out).</comment>

<comment>A Republican "year of ideas," according to budget gadfly and lifelong beneficiary of governmental largesse,  Paul Ryan.What's left out of his bold statement is that the Republican "year of ideas"  is 1979.The ideas are:--big tax cuts for the richest--more burden on the middle class--ever-higher deficits--repeal or savage Medicare,  Social Security,  and now the ACA--repeal regulations to turn Wall Street loose--do the bidding of ALEC--overindulge the military and foment perpetual war.Get ready.

<comment>War is republicans' idea of stimulus to the economy.</comment>

<comment>They have several years of ideas, depending on which Republicans you ask - including the 1950s, the 1920s, the 1890s, or the 1850s.</comment>

<comment>Insanity: doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.Ergo, Republicans in congress are insane.</comment>

<comment>It'd be devastating and horrible for a lot of people, but a part of me wants to see Obama pass the bill, just to watch Republicans scramble to avoid the epic meltdown of our health care system that would follow.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I feel mean-spirited thinking it, but for him to let it sit unti January 20 next year, then sign it, would be kind of a fun poke in the eye to see, until that poke reaches everyone's eye.</comment>

<comment>He may veto it within ten days or it automatically becomes law.</comment>

<comment>That would be even better.  They passed the bill to force the President to put his signature on the veto against it.  This supposedly puts him against the will of the people.But if he does not sign or veto the bill, it becomes law without his signature opposing it, and the consequences will be squarely on the Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Did you stop and think of what those consequences are?</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. It would be terrible for everyone.  The bigger question is did the Republicans think about the consequences of their action?Ryan and McConnell would have to man up and defend their law, or back off and restore the provisions they cut.  I don't think voters will be impressed either way.</comment>

<comment>Congress and the majority of Americans get their healthcare through their employers. This won't hurt them. It will hurt all those welfare queens the Republicans think vote Democratic but are actually Republican.</comment>

<comment>I agree, but it would hurt everyone.  Our employer-plan premiums would increase, probably by a lot.  And the local impact of health providers cutting back staff.</comment>

<comment>Playing devil's advocate, the consequences might be good for the country in the long run. The chaos that would ensue would surely hurt a lot of people, myself included This is bad. BUT, it would force Congress to act, and it would force Republicans to cooperate with Democrats to fix the problem. The resulting solution might be better than Obamacare, and even if it's not, at least it would be everyone's baby. We could call it Incompecare.</comment>

<comment>There would be no health plan until the Democrats retake Congress. We just can not expect the Republicans to act like adults.</comment>

<comment>Well, actually, no.  The consequences would fall primarily on the 18 million (or so) people who would lose their health insurance.</comment>

<comment>Which would require a response by Congress to fix the problem they created.  I didn't say it would be good for anyone in the short term.</comment>

<comment>Why would it "require a response by Congress"?</comment>

<comment>I think we learn something either way. If Congress didn't act it would mean that either 1) the chaos wasn't that bad, and we getting worked up over an historically inconsequential thing, or 2) the chaos is that bad, but Congress cannot, or will not act, which tells us with surety that our democracy experiment has failed.</comment>

<comment>Or 3) the chaos (and more to the point, the suffering) is that bad, but Republicans in Congress won't act because they don't perceive it as being in their self-interest to improve access to affordable health care for working-class citizens.</comment>

<comment>that falls under "2)" I think</comment>

<comment>Okay, but it doesn't mean "our democracy experiment has failed".  It would mean that the newly uninsured tens of millions don't have enough power to get the outcome they would like.That outcome wouldn't be all that surprising.  They're a relatively small minority in a nation of over 300 million people.  And they're primarily working-class, which means they have less political power than do more affluent citizens.</comment>

<comment>If the bill had been signed into law, the immediate impact of millions losing coverage and/or dropping coverage - with the purchase mandate going away - would be huge job cuts across the medical insurance and provider industries, plus huge increases in premiums for everyone.The backlash from businesses and constituents would force them to something.  The most likely something would have to be to roll back the repeal they just passed, since there's no fix (like dropping coverage for pre-existing conditions) that could get 60 Senate votes.</comment>

<comment>Maybe!  Or maybe congressional Republicans would make the calculation that the "backlash from business and constituents" will dissipate, and that they'll be better able to retain power by continuing to run against "Obamacare".</comment>

<comment>That would be scary.  With a Presidential election this year (even with gerrymandered districts), I wonder if there are enough extremist right wing voters to overcome it.  Every D campaign and PAC ad until election day would be:  Why did your local hospital and doctor's office cut staff?  Why did unemployment suddenly jump?  Why did your health insurance double? <pic of="" r="" rep="">.</comment>

<comment>We agree---scary, but possible.</comment>

<comment>you are forgetting the problem that caused obamacareand romneycare to be passed in the first place</comment>

<comment>What problem is that?</comment>

<comment>you must be one of those fox news viewers whothink obamacare and romneycare were passedjust for the fun of it</comment>

<comment>Err, no.  Look, all I said was that the consequences of the Republican bill becoming law would fall primarily upon the millions of people who would lose their health insurance.  It's entirely possible that congressional Republicans would pay little or no price for their vote.</comment>

<comment>a lot more than the 18 milllion</comment>

<comment>Okay, how many?</comment>

<comment>an exampleIt’s worth noting, moreover, that the impact of a decision to gut Obamacare in Kingwould extend far beyond the people who lose their tax credits. Without these credits, the actual premiums paid by most consumers in the health exchanges will spike massively, leading many healthy individuals to drop their coverage. Yet, as healthy people drop out of the market, they will no long pay premiums that insurance companies need to cover the costs of their sick customers — which will force the insurers to raise premiums even more. The likely result is a death spiral, where higher premiums beget fewer customers which beget higher premiums, until the entire insurance market collapses.leaving the govt to deal with healthcare, single payer by default</comment>

<comment>Ehh. I wouldn't shed any tears! With a $6,500 deductible, it's not like I'm getting any healthcare anyway. Actually, if I were able to save up all the money I pay in premiums, I could afford to see my doc once or twice a year.</comment>

<comment>Sorry.  We agree health insurance costs too much.  It's small (if any!) comfort to be able to say it would be worse without the ACA.</comment>

<comment>Without the ACA, insurers and service providers eventually would have been forced to rein in costs to the point where customers could afford their products. As long as the government is picking up the tab, though, there is no need to economize. Uncle Sam has VERY deep pockets!</comment>

<comment>Not necessarily.  Insurers were making good profits by eliminating expensive-to-treat customers.  (The ACA ended that.)And roughly 3/4 of the ACA is aimed at cost controls.  In fact, it's partly because of the ACA that health care inflation is lower in the US than it's been in 50 years.  Part of that is become under the ACA "Uncle Sam" no longer "is picking up the tab" for every health care service provided, but is now paying for quality rather than simply quantity of care.</comment>

<comment>Wow, can I have some of that Kool-Aid? It must be pretty tasty. My Obamacare premium (bronze policy) went up 22% from 2015 to 2016 and my subsidy went up 10%.In the year before the ACA went into effect, I could have purchased a decent policy with a reasonable deductible and co-pays for less than $200 a month. I'm paying more than that now for what is basically a catastrophic policy ($6,500 deductible before it covers anything except the mandated freebies). I'm not too worried about it, though, because the government is picking up most of the tab!Health care costs spiraled out of control in part because people with employer-provided insurance weren't motivated to control spending. As long as their employer, and its insurance company, was picking up the tab, the cost didn't matter. Now a lot of people aren't worried about how much their insurance costs because they're paying only a small portion of the bill. What do you think that is going to do to prices? Up, up, up.</comment>

<comment>My condolences. What are you paying now?</comment>

<comment>I switched to a different company with an even more stripped-down plan. I'd have to look it up, but I think the premium is about $220 a month, of which I pay only $10 (by working part-time and doing a lot of my investing in my retirement IRA, I can hold my income down so as to maximize my subsidy).Thing is, there is no reason I shouldn't be working more and buying my own insurance (or working for an employer who offers it). The current system makes it very easy to be a slacker, though, and I am happy to oblige! In the past, I worked a hideous job just to have health insurance. Very glad I don't have to do that now!But I am older and have a paid-for house and car ... my needs are pretty minimal, so I can get by not working very much. It would be harder for a younger person who needs to earn more and would receive a smaller subsidy as a result, while paying the premiums inflated by the ACA.</comment>

<comment>Thanks.  So, if I read you correctly, you're paying less than $300/year in insurance premiums under the current system.  And you have the option to spend somewhat more to get a smaller deductible, but have chosen not to.  And because of the ACA you don't have to choose between working part-time and having health insurance, and you're glad about that.And under this system, the federal government's deficits are smaller than they otherwise would be, and health care inflation is at its lowest rates in a half-century.Good to know, thanks again.</comment>

<comment>Health care spending increased 5 percent in 2014, the biggest jump since before the recession. I haven't seen the numbers for 2015 yet, but I expect the upward trend continued (it was projected to increase by more than 6 percent). I don't anticipate anyone -- government or citizen -- saving money under the current system. You keep drinking that Kool-Aid, though!And, again, it's great that I can slack and get the government to pick up the tab for my health insurance. It's not so great that someone else -- perhaps someone who needs to work harder in order to support a family -- ends up subsidizing the cost of my insurance. The government shouldn't be in the business of encouraging people to slack and work the system ... but the people who do will probably vote for the people who make it possible for them to slack. And when you understand that, you understand why we have Obamacare in the first place. </comment>

<comment>Maybe!But what "Kool-Aid"?  What was factually inaccurate about what I wrote?</comment>

<comment>Sorry for the delay; it was time to milk the cow. OK, factual inaccuracies:1) *I* am paying less than $300 a year for insurance only because my fellow taxpayers are being forced to pay the other ~$2,400. Again, there is no need for this -- I could dip into saving to buy my own insurance, or find a job to provide me with some (as I did in the past); it's simply to my advantage to take the free ride.2) I *could* spend more to get a smaller deductible, and it would not trouble me to do so, but for a lot of people, that additional expense poses a real hardship. (Most people making less than $20,000 a year do not have a couple hundred grand in assets stashed away.)On a similar note, those higher deductibles are going to pose a real hardship for people, especially poor people, who actually have to use their insurance. Somewhere I read a study (Kaiser Foundation?) that indicated people with high deductibles behave a lot like people who are uninsured -- that is, they simply don't go to doctors. For many, if not most, people (especially those with bronze policies), Obamacare only provides insurance, not actual health care.3) If you think the government is somehow going to save money, over the long run, by subsidizing the insurance policies of ~10 million people, I have a bridge, etc. Yes, they can play a shell game of moving money out of Medicare to subsidize the ACA, but over the long run, what you will have is simply another enormously expensive government program. It is already extremely difficult to ferret out information, such as how much the subsidies are already costing the government. I find that telling. I also think it's entirely possible the government will drive itself into irreparable solvency trying to buy insurance, at market rates, for everyone. (As long as the Democrats can buy themselves votes using the money in the public treasury, they will do so, and the budget be damned! And because so many people -- myself included -- have been coaxed onto the dole, I don't see the Democrats leaving the Oval Office anytime soon.)4) Health care spending declined during the recent recession, but it's ramping up again (perhaps not coincidentally, since the ACA went into effect). In 2014, government spending on health care saw an especially large increase (11.7 percent, compared to 3.5 percent in 2013). Total spending on health care -- including ACA subsidies, Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP -- accounted for 24 percent of the federal budget. Last year, health care spending made up 17.5 percent of the GDP.  (Source: http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/... This does not suggest we are bringing costs under control; quite the opposite (which is exactly what one would expect, with the infusion of fresh government money into the system).As costs continue to soar, you can look for government officials to wring their hands, shrug their shoulders and say, "This wasn't supposed to happen!" But anyone with half a brain could see it coming from miles away.Don't believe me? Just wait and see.</comment>

<comment>Maybe!  On the other hand, ACA skeptics have been predicting doom since before it became law...and none of those predictions has come true.  http://nymag.com/daily/intelli...Yes, the ACA is an "expensive government program".  But it's also a deficit-reducing program because it cut spending (that $700 billion in projected payments to Medicare insurers and providers) and increased taxes (primarily on those with annual incomes over $200,000/year).We agree that, on the whole, "bronze" plans aren't as good a deal as "silver" plans for most folks.For what it's worth, Democrats are likely to be "leaving the Oval Office" sometime soon, if only because it's relatively rare in US politics for one party to control that office for more than 12-16 years in a row.  (And given the number of Medicare, Social Security and federal pension recipients who've been "coaxed onto the dole" and yet vote regularly for Republican candidates, I don't think there's much reason to fear what will happen with ACA beneficiaries.  (See: the Kentucky gubernatorial election last fall.)</comment>

<comment>Your NY Mag link is an excellent piece of spin. Having been in PR myself, I know propaganda when I see it! The author does a pretty good (albeit ultimately unconvincing) job of shucking and jiving there. I don't have time to refute the entire piece, but I'll tackle a bit of it. "Let's take these claims in order," indeed!#1 - The author disputes the contention that “millions of Americans were forced to change insurance plans," but conveniently overlooks the fact that cancellations may have been fewer than projected because the administration relaxed the rules, allowing non-compliant plans to be "grandfathered in," when it became apparent that failing to do so would bring out the pitchforks and torches. #2 - The author makes it sound as if Obamacare policyholders are happily choosing narrow-network plans. The market has spoken, right?! Well, not so. I find it more likely that many consumers -- myself included -- have surveyed the plans available to us and concluded they're mostly a bad deal for the money. As a result, we're selecting the cheapest plans available, in order to be compliant with the law and avoid a fine. We don't actually expect our plans to provide us with any care, thus we're not worried about the narrow networks; we just want to pay the lowest cost possible, and the crappy policy is cheaper than the fine.And if "narrow networks are spreading" in ACA-land, it's probably due to the fact that Obamacare customers haven't exactly been money-makers for insurance companies. A significant percentage of the healthy/desirable customers have thus far refused to fall into line and take up the burden of subsidizing their unhealthy/less desirable cohorts by purchasing policies. Insurers are caught between a rock and a hard place: trying to woo reluctant cost-conscious customers while holding the line on reimbursements. Narrowing networks is a sly solution, as it enables insurers to hold down premiums and also skip out of paying for care. (The insurance I had last year included coverage only in a seven-county area in SWPA, with NO out-of-network coverage whatsoever. Talk about a narrow network!)#3 - "Premiums rose." The author doesn't even attempt to dispute this, LOL! His claims that federal spending on healthcare are declining also seem a bit premature -- they actually rose by nearly 12 percent in 2014, although at the time this piece was written, the numbers may not have been in yet, just as we don't have figures yet (as far as I can tell) for 2015.The bottom line is that health care inflation still exceeds the growth of the CPI (2.9 percent vs. 2 percent) and overall health care spending is increasing by about 6 percent a year. (Not a high water mark in terms of spending increases, to be sure, but it's not going down, either.) Incidentally, the above figures were reported here: http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ho...The piece goes on to suggest that slowing growth of health care spending isn't due to better cost controls so much as it is people not seeking out care because they can't afford higher deductibles and co-pays. Well, that is certainly one way to keep down costs!OK, that's all I have time for now -- gotta milk the cow.</comment>

<comment>I'll add to the above: Keep in mind that one of the ways in which the ACA was supposed to break even was through a raft of new taxes, but those may not become a reality, at least not permanently. After raising less revenue than anticipated, the medical device excise tax was shelved for the next 2 years. A repeal of the 'Cadillac tax' on top-shelf employee insurance plans is, of course, included in the ACA repeal bill passed by both houses that the President will undoubtedly veto, but there are signals that a freestanding bill calling for the repeal of just the Caddy tax might be palatable to enough Democrats to make a 'go' of it. Would the President repeal that bill, too, knowing how unpopular the Caddy tax is likely to be with voters (in an election year)? Hmm ...</comment>

<comment>Why is ther a caddy tax Willow?</comment>

<comment>That's a good question, Lew! It seems to follow that people who have excellent insurance coverage are probably at very low risk of defaulting on their medical bills, or needing assistance from government programs to pay them, and thus it would seem wise to encourage employers to provide good coverage, or at least not DISCOURAGE them from doing so! Eh? But that would make sense, and the government seldom makes sense.I believe the official rationale is that people with Cadillac plans seldom care about the cost of healthcare, because their insurance is probably picking up most, if not all, of the tab, and thus they're partly to blame for the high cost of healthcare, because they don't shop around for the best rates. By discouraging employers from offering excellent policies, at least some workers would be forced to accept lower-quality insurance with higher co-pays and deductibles. With more skin in the game, they'll become more savvy consumers, and help to drive down healthcare costs across-the-board. (Never mind the personal hardship this might cause them, so long as it benefits the collective, right?)The "Cadillac tax" would also at least partially close the loophole that allows employees to receive something from their employers -- health insurance -- without paying taxes on it. The government simply HAS to have a piece of the action! Which brings us to ...Perhaps most importantly, because the 'Cadillac tax' is projected to affect such a large number of workers, it is expected to generate oodles and oodles of revenue for the government! The CBO estimates the government will reap $120 billion (that's billion-with-a-B) in new tax dollars between 2018 (when it goes into effect) and 2024. That revenue can, of course, be used to offset the costs associated with Obamacare, such as the subsides, err, I mean tax credits, for low-income participants. Just a little income redistribution, folks; nothing to see here, just keep moving. ;-)</comment>

<comment>Why do Republicans vote on a bill to repeal Obamacare? Because they know it'll never pass. Why do Republicans refuse to vote on a jobs bill? Because they know it'll pass. Why do Republicans refuse to vote on war with Syria or Iran? Because if it passes, they'll be held responsible when the war goes bad. The Republican party wants to play it safe and the base is starting to realize this. The reason so many conservatives are rejecting establishment candidates is because they know they're all talk. Promising to do this or that, but once in office, they won't deliver. If a Republican does end up winning in November, don't be surprised if certain Republicans in Congress suddenly balk. Obamacare, for its faults, has become entrenched. Good luck taking insurance away from millions of people in red states. The party doesn't answer to the people. It answers to corporations. No way will they sit back and let you take away all their new customers.</comment>

<comment>"If a Republican does end up winning in November, don't be surprised if certain Republicans in Congress suddenly balk."If I understand you correctly, you think that - having achieved power - they'll suddenly get a conscience or become less crazy?Not going to happen. They really believe all the vitriolic nonsense they spout.Besides, there is the matter of Supreme Court nominees. Anyone want another Scalia or Thomas? The Republicans and big business do.</comment>

<comment>No, I don't think they'll suddenly grow a conscience. But like all politicians, they'll do what's in their best self-interest. In this case, the Republicans in office answer to big business. The insurance industry would flip out if you suddenly took away millions of their customers. And the health care industry loves people who have insurance. Do you think a Republican is going to want to offend those industries? Of course not.</comment>

<comment>Nor would a democrat either, for that matter. Look how easily the medical device tax was delayed. You know, one of the things that pays for Obamacare. It's funny, because the Democrats championed it, and Republicans always go on about being fiscally conservative, and then they join hands to delay a provision unpopular with industry that they should, in theory, both support.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't appear to be happening in Kentucky</comment>

<comment>Boy, life sure was easier when the repubs could spend their days just lobbing spitballs from the sidelines. Governance is tough work, and repubs are learning the hard way.The current repub epiphany is so laughable. They just now realize the republicans have been fleecing them. They wont admit it, but its exactly what the "libtards" tried to tell them for decades.  Better late than never?  Or...it's about time?  But electing a clown like trump out of spite won't hurt anyone but themselves, just like all their other misguided votes for the rinos that have been playing them. Vote smart, not out of spite. </comment>

<comment>It isn't spite. I think his supporters genuinely believe he'll make good on his promises. The reason they trust him is because he's not a career politician. Jeb Bush could make the exact same promises Trump has, but conservatives would roll their eyes. It would be like Hillary saying she's going to break up the big banks or regulate Wall Street. No one would take such a promise seriously coming from her.</comment>

<comment>I'd like to keep an open mind about Ryan,and I really try to. Its important to give ideas due consideration.But then I remember that I'm basically deluding myself into thinking Ryan is a moderate when just 6-8 years ago he would be considered one of the most conservative members of congress ever, and keeping an open mind gets a lot harder.</comment>

<comment>Don't keep your mind so far open that your brains fall out.</comment>

<comment>Democrats should send a letter to every new Obamacare enrollee telling them that if the Republicans win they can kiss their health care goodbye.</comment>

<comment>Health care is expensive. Very expensive. Hospitals are manned 24/7/365 and they use expensive imaging and treatment technology. The personnel cost a lot of money (the administrators too much, but that's another story). It costs a lot of money to train new doctors and nurses. It's also very profitable, and all of us have to absorb that cost as well. People who think that repealing Obamacare is going to render health care cheaper and more efficient are just plain dumb.</comment>

<comment>Repealing Obamacare was never about making health care cheaper. It has always been about "Obama sumptin', sumptin'".</comment>

<comment>The ACA raises taxes on the one percent. It's as simple as that. Do you think the Republican Party has any issue more important than making rich people richer at every one else's expense?</comment>

<comment>I'll give Obama this, he made healthcare reform happen. We may repeal Obamacare, but reform will be addressed regardless. That was Obamas goal and he achieved it even if it won't be his signature law. Love him or hate him, and love Obamacare or hate it, healthcare reform needed to happen decades ago and we have finally addressed it. </comment>

<comment>That's a true statement and worthy of some thought. It is why the GOP squirms like a bug stuck with a pin on healthcare. The wealthy elites didn't want the Federal government involved AT ALL and now they know in their hearts they can't back out without losing a huge part of their base (poor whites) who are generally too stupid to understand what's really happening, but if thrown directly under a bus will feel pain and lash out.</comment>

<comment>What the Latest Obamacare Repeal Is Really About=========Vote for Republicans. That's all it was.</comment>

<comment>Wonder what the Rs will think of the fallout if they are successful.</comment>

<comment>So they have repealed MOST of ACA - except for the popular requirement that insurance companies not discriminate against preexisting conditions. If they really put that into effect under a GOP administration, we could all wait until we got sick and then get insurance. How's that supposed to work?The GOP will never really repeal ACA - just continue posturing.</comment>

<comment>It's about too dam much.  They've cut their work days down to part-time, they collect huge salaries & perks & the only legislation they can craft is 50+ failed attempts to repeal something the country wants.This is their idea of "proving" they can do anything, next year or next decade?  Insane & quite expensive for the taxpayers.</comment>

<comment>White people should not be allowed to write any more laws.</comment>

<comment>I think the base is sick of show votes anyway.  I'm not sure this was smart strategy.   I wouldn't be shocked if some of this vote becomes a liability for some of the Republican Senators up for re-election in 2016.</comment>

<comment>I'm so sick of all of these dumb F's. Let's just do away with Congress & we'll represent ourselves with popular votes on everything.  We can just do everything online & not waste money on them & their salaries.</comment>

<comment>Fits right in to Ryan's free market philosophy. The free market doesn't care how many people die because of lack of health care or insurance, and neither does Paul Ryan. Americans, be careful what you vote for this year. </comment>

<comment>You do know Christianity was spread with sword in hand right?</comment>

<comment>Nope it wasn't. Not until the Italians got involved. That reminds me, if you get the call to think about this stuff in more detail stay away from Roman Catholicism. That's just my advice. </comment>

<comment>What year was that?</comment>

<comment>Sometime around 300 AD I think. The Italian emperor Constantine got that ball rolling. I guess it was part of the Plan.</comment>

<comment>Was enslaving people in Africa and the Americas also part of his plan? Also, how do you say Christianity wasn't spread by the sword?</comment>

<comment>Christianity spread from the Middle East south to N. Africa North to Europe and beyond by word of mouth and word of deed. Europe was Christianized little by little but the sword wasn't used for that purpose because...no power at that time. It takes a worldly king for that kind of undertaking and those people were not interested in saving men's souls. I'll ask you because I don't know. What nation or people were conquered by Christians for the purpose of converting the people? The answer is none so don't bother looking. Follow the money honey.</comment>

<comment>http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/N...I would say most every nation in north, central, and south america.</comment>

<comment>Roman Catholicism in thrall to the European monarchs with insatiable appetites for wealth and power, not Christians really but they served their purpose..... On the other hand the missions in California were a godsend to the Indians. Not all in Christendom are Christians. I agree that's a tough stumbling block to get around for people not willing to take a closer look at what was really going on.</comment>

<comment>You just admitted Christianity was spread by force.</comment>

<comment>Not necessarily. I don't count RC as Christian but they did have the Word of God for the most part and they served their purpose. Now look at them. </comment>

<comment>Except they're not doing everything they can do repeal Obamacare.  They aren't refusing to fund the government.  This is a show vote.</comment>

<comment>They must be thinking of some other White House.Republicans will never have a chance of replacing the ACA until they absorb the fact that it has to be paid for. Until then, their "replacement" is what we had before.</comment>

<comment>and they've backed themselves into such a corner any solution the offer has to be virtually free which is impossible</comment>

<comment>Congratulations, Republicans! You got something done this past year. And it was a complete, and predictable, failure. I'm sure you worked hard on this BS.</comment>

<comment>Obamacare didn't do a thing to reform healthcare, it just set up a Rube Goldberg machine to change how the same broken system is financed.  It's subsidies for Americans aged between 55 and 64 paid by younger Americans, susidies for the lower middle class paid for by the upper middle class, subsidies for unhealthy individuals paid for by healthy individuals.It is financed with regressive taxes levied on Americans who are already taxed at the highest rates (the upper middle class).  It shifted health care costs from billionaires, like Donald Trump, to working Americans.  Because it's paid with income, rather than capital gains, it hurts workers, while exempting rentors and inheirtors.Demand better America.</comment>

<comment>what have you got thats better</comment>

<comment>I would do two things.First, break up the current tax laws that result in working Americans getting health insurance through employers.  I manage to find car insurance without any concern to employer, likewise, millions of Americans found health care though those exchanges that were set up.Second, fund government healthcare (VA, Medicare, Medicaid, Obamacare subsidie) through general taxes (paid by all), rather than special taxes (which politicans can hoist onto workers). McCain had a pretty fleshed out plan back in 2008; I'd consider it to be a legitimate starting point.</comment>

<comment>McCain's plan was mostly a different subsidy in the form of tax credits for the costs of insurance.   the problem was it was indexed to regular inflation so it'd have zero protections from the massive increases in health insurance rates that go on.  Nor did it provide any other actual reforms to how the insurance industry works</comment>

<comment>By the time we're debating regular vs medical inflation, we have moved into the wonk zone.</comment>

<comment>"It's subsidies for Americans aged between 55 and 64 paid by younger Americans, susidies for the lower middle class paid for by the upper middle class, subsidies for unhealthy individuals paid for by healthy individuals."You don't seem to understand how group insurance works whether it is public or private.  All group insurance is pooled risked.  You know, so a kid will Type I diabetes can get health care without bankrupting his parents.  So when you're no longer young and healthy, you can still have access to affordable health care and so on and so forth.  That is the point of pooled risk.  Some will need less help, some will need more.  Everyone gets taken care when they need it most.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. What Cody describes as a "Rube Goldberg machine" is actually just "how insurance works."</comment>

<comment>I completely understand how group insurance works.  I also know that my car insurance (pooled group risk) would do through the roof if I ever had a Driving While Intoxicated conviction.</comment>

<comment>Interesting non sequitur. Is it your position that a person's health insurance proceeds should spike when that person gets sick? That would defeat the concept of health insurance.</comment>

<comment>If you think health care and car insurance are the same.  You're not getting it.</comment>

<comment>We did.  For example, the public option.  It was a non-starter, thanks to recalcitrant reactionaries.</comment>

<comment>Stop peeing on the floor. Use the litter box.</comment>

<comment>Do Not be fooled by any lies or trickery! Our House of Representative has the power to STOP Obamacare and also the power to STOP the killing of babies now, today by DEFUNDING it!Our House of Representatives can  DEFUND 0bamacare (power of the purse) without the approval of Our Senate and 0bama can Not veto as a budget is Not law. Our House of Representatives can also DEFUND the killing of babies!  A budget expires and a law does not. A budget is under the total and complete power of Our House of Representatives.“The House of Representatives cannot only refuse, but they alone can propose, the supplies requisite for the support of the government…This power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutatory measure.” -- James Madison in Federalist 58"All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills." -- Article I, Section 7, Clause 1 of Our Constitutionhttp://krisannehall.com/who-ha...</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate America?</comment>

<comment>You're hitting that PB & J pretty hard. Ease off before you do yourself harm (of course it would be covered under Obamacare, but still)</comment>

<comment>Who is killing babies? That's awful.</comment>

<comment>The implication is that it's Democrats.</comment>

<comment>I am guessing that millions of voters who voted for Mr Obama twice are now paying much more for their HC than they were 4 years ago . Are they going to vote democrat again?? Are they going to believe Hillarys lies like they believed Obamas??  Time will tell .</comment>

<comment>"This analysis confirms recent employer survey data from the Kaiser Family Foundation: a slowdown in the growth of premiums and deductibles in the past few years, notably since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010."http://www.commonwealthfund.or...Yes, health insurance premiums are still climbing, but slower than they were under Bush.</comment>

<comment>I believe that was the reason for Obamacare in the first place, to keep them from rising as fast as they were.  It's still unsustainable, but at least an improvement.  I'll vote for single-payer.</comment>

<comment>Yes, of course you are "guessing".</comment>

<comment>My family now buy an Obamacare compliant policy, though we pay all premiums ourselves, which has  allowed my husband to quit a corporate job he hated and become self employed. We actually pay less in premiums than we did with the “gold” type corporate policy - though as the premiums for that (which were actually not all that heavily subsidized by the company)  were buried in the paycheck deductions, we are more aware of our health insurance costs.Look - American heath care costs (excluding the costs of administrating insurance) run at about a quarter of a million $ per person over a life. So if you are not paying a lot of money for your family for healthcare costs - then, in effect you are expecting someone else to be subsidizing you. Fine if you are low income, but if you’re not, you have to step up.So how does this fit in with your ideas about paying for healthcare?</comment>

<comment>You will definitely become more aware of your health care costs because it appears you do not yet understand that your Obamacare premiums are NOT tax deductible as your employer premiums were.You can only write off as a medical expense that amount of Obamacare premium that exceeds 10% of your income.Example: Your combined income is 85K and you pay 15K for Obamacare. 10% of your income is 8,500. You can only write off $6,500 of your premiums as oppose to the entire 15,000 when your employer provided it.So your taxable income is now 93,500, moving you from the 25% tax bracket to the 28% tax bracket.You will get a tax hike of 2,380. NOW you see why Democrats are going to use the Cadillac tax to phase out employer insurance.They have ALWAYS intended to pay for subsidies with this massive tax hike.</comment>

<comment>If you mean will Hillary be our next president? the answer is yes.</comment>

<comment>Man I hope not.  We might as well elect a Republican if that's the case.  Bernie '16.</comment>

<comment>I'm just being realistic. I won't vote for her, but my vote doesn't really matter, since I don't live in one of those 12 counties in 5 states where your presidential vote matters.</comment>

<comment>If you live in a swing state, your vote matters regardless of the county.</comment>

<comment>That is true. Here, in my efforts at hyperbole, I said something dumb.</comment>

<comment>If you think that there's no difference between Hillary as President and some troglodyte like Cruz or Trump, you're delusional. You may love Bernie (he's pretty cool), but there is a world of difference between Cruz or Trump, and Hillary. </comment>

<comment>My comment was meant as a reference to her past history, not how she's swiveling at the moment to shill for votes.  I know there's a world of difference between all of them - it's just I don't feel she's much of an improvement over a Republican.</comment>

<comment>Let's imagine Ted Cruz as president, versus Hillary. A Republican Congress sends the bill they sent today, to defund Planned Parenthood and repeal Obamacare, to the White House. Hillary repeals it. Cruz signs it. Two or three Supreme Court justices retire or die in the next few years. Cruz appoints clones of Scalia and Alito. Hillary appoints new versions of Kagan and Sotomayor. Congress sends a bill to defund Dodd-Frank, and the Consumer Protection Bureau. Cruz signs it, Hillary vetoes it. Congress sends a bill to authorize the Keystone pipeline. Cruz signs it, Hillary vetoes it. And many more.Much of an improvement over Republicans? A world of difference, I think. Do not underestimate the difference between one of these Republican clowns becoming president, and Hillary becoming president. It's huge. </comment>

<comment>The Obama voters have been suckered twice . If she is electedit will be 3 times.</comment>

<comment>You must have a crystal ball.I tend to look at facts like she's running for a historically difficult 3rd term /same party, following the guy who has literally elected more Republicans than anyone else in US history, campaigning as both his signature domestic legislation and his foreign policy implode.And she is has LOTS of baggage and no charisma.So I wouldn't gloat about Hillary just yet.Unless you really like crow au gratin.</comment>

<comment>You'd think that she wouldn't have much of a chance. That is until you look at the other party that is falling all over itself to make it seem as hateful and exclusionary as possible.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that's my view as well. She is far from a perfect candidate. But the once-GOP is so fractured at this point, it's just hard to see how she loses.</comment>

<comment>I won't be voting for her so calm down. The primary will kill whichever Republican emerges, just like it did a far more viable candidate than any of the current ones in Romney.</comment>

<comment>You may be right.That's why John Huntsman, who would have beaten Obama in a landslide, couldn't make it.He couldn't get through the nutcase religious rights GOP primary gauntlet.</comment>

<comment>Actually, we are paying a lot less than we would have without Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>I'm paying less and not regretting my votes. And yes, I kept my doctor. Dream on.</comment>

<comment>And I suppose your deductables are lower too?  Dream on.</comment>

<comment>They didn't change. They are no higher nor lower. And, I was able to keep my grad student daughter on my plan for an additional year, which was a help.</comment>

<comment>Thats because you have employer insurance.You will most likely be on Medicare when the Cadillac tax starts phasing out employer insurance.So don't complain when your "rich" Greedy Capitalist daughter and her husband ,who make an obscene 97K, get a body blow tax hike of 2,250 when the Cadillac tax hits and their employer converts tax free health care into taxable salary.Then they get dumped into Medicaid for All Obamacare while bankrolling their neighbor's subsidy.Surprise Surprise. Obamas biggest lie of all was "If you make less than 250K your taxes won't go up."Read CNNs Jake Tappers article and weep.http://www.cnn.Com/2014/11/18/politics/gruber-obamacare-promises/</comment>

<comment>A bunch of unsubstantiated supposition. Seriously get a grip. If you want to complain about things being expensive, protest against the wars your taxes go to perpetuating.</comment>

<comment>I just have to laugh, because you so obviously didn't read Jake Tappers article, which spells out the truth about the Cadillac tax in gory detail.Its the biggest fraud in Obamacare, with LOTS of competition.Theres no way you could have read the linked article, because you didn't have enough time before your dumb knee jerk response.</comment>

<comment>You don't get to call my family names, pigbitch. Shut it.And there is no program called "Medicaid for All Obamacare" except in your schizoid, disordered little brain.</comment>

<comment>"Beeotch."I get to hit a double on you Buddy.1. I can only assume you chose "Beeotch", after hilariously telling me I can't call your family names, due to the "Grl" in my screen name. I so LOVE dragging Lefty Sexists out of the closet. Doesn't bode well for Hillary does it????2. You have zero argument abut the FACT that the Cadillac tax is going to shove your daughter into Obamacare and hit her with a body blow tax hike.</comment>

<comment>You don't know that. And I notice you took out that "greedy" insult. Good. You're capable of learning, pigbitch. That's nice. Maybe your disorder isn't as bad as I thought.</comment>

<comment>LolIve definitely hit a nerve.I do know that. You only had one way of knowing Im female, which is "girl" so you chose "Beeotch."You inadvertently outed yourself.And now you've really gone to town calling me "pigbitch."You're just another redneck bubba closeted in the Left wing.</comment>

<comment>I didn't "out" myself idiot; I am a woman and so are you. I do not take insults to my family kindly, so I will respond in kind. If you had called her "greedy" to my face, yours would be messed up right now. "Pigbitch" was mild. Leave me - and her -alone.</comment>

<comment>You seem to forget this is in print, not verbal.I did NOT insult your family. I didn't not call your daughter greedy and I NEVER took anything out.You are making that up as an excuse for your stupid behavior, because you've made an absolute FOOL of yourself. And I bet you have a very well adjusted daughter with loads of self esteem if you go around calling other  WOMEN "beeotch" and "pigbitch." Go back to your trailer park, HoneyBoo.Last but not least,  your daughter WILL, if Democrats get their way, be forced into Obamacare with a massive tax hike. You don't have a shred of argument to counter THAT.</comment>

<comment>More evidence you need to go back to your trailer park, HoneyBoo.Before I reveal what a cultural and otherwise illiterate fool you are, Id like you to consider again that you did one heck of a lot more damage to your daughter calling other women beeotch and pigbitch, with your claim that those are "mild," than I EVER could have calling her a "Greedy Capitalist."You are illiterate, don't recognize a cultural reference when you see one.You IDIOTICALLY thought I was referring specifically to your daughter with the term "greedy Capitalist."I was sarcastically referring to Democrats' real definition of "RICH/GREEDY CAPITALIST 1%er" for tax hike purposes is NOT 250K, but 400% poverty level income, which means Obama defines your middle income daughter as a "Greedy Capitalist" for Obamacare tax hikes. GOT IT?????Could you make it any clearer you have no college under your belt???GO BACK AND READ IT. Maybe you'll get it the second time around.EVERYONE ELSE here already did.</comment>

<comment>Lies. 1%'s are not middle class. I also don't really care if someone who makes a hundo has to pay tax. They certainly have nothing to worry about in surviving.</comment>

<comment>So you too, cannot grasp the concept that Cadillac tax phase out of employer insurance makes "If you make less than 250k your taxes won't go up" Obama's biggest lie by far.</comment>

<comment>You said, "your rich Greedy Capitalist daughter and her husband". And of course your posts -all of them - drip with irony and sarcasm. Who could miss it? But, who imagines that to be attractive??Of course I don't go around calling other women names (ok, honesty compels me to make an exception for Sarah on these boards, because she so often sounds foolish about Trump) because no other woman has ever been a big enough witch or a fool to insult my daughter in front of me. You're quite the special case, aren't you?My daughter is laughing at you. My husband, the therapist, suggests you keep your next appointment. And I can see my master's degree on the wall from here.Oh, and your misplaced diatribe about your $97K? We didn't get any tax hike, and we make more than that. So, please try to squeeze back under the stye, pig, and once again -leave us alone.</comment>

<comment>Well you cant fix stupid.I thought perhaps you could get the nuance referring to taxation of middle class as Greedy Capitalists, but you're more illiterate than I thought.As if I care what your husband the "therapist" thinks. He's married to a low class HoneyBoo , has allowed the mother of his female child to mildly" go around calling other women Beeotch and PigBitch, as if YOU don't need an appointment for THAT.So I'd say his marriage alone puts his professional judgment in the dumpster.Since you can't even get past my reference to Obama's lie about no one making more than 250k will get a tax hike, well I'm sure it's hopeless to think you could possibly come up with a cogent argument to the fraudulent Cadillac tax.</comment>

<comment>The tax hike that we didn't get. Right, that one. Oh, and the false "Medicaid for All Obamacare" program that you made up.Well, hubby does say it's usually impossible to convince the delusional. Sorry. I'm sure your condition is very difficult for you, but you know, it's best not to insult therapists. They are only trying to help people like you.It's also best not to tick off their wives, pigbeeotch.</comment>

<comment>You have NO idea what I'm talking about with regard to the Cadillac tax.We didn't get it because the Cadillac tax doesn't even start until 2018, now delayed to 2020, you moron.You just keep digging. I'm enjoying watching you make a fool of yourself.What, you can't do anything without your hubby?Can't argue without him holding your hand?Ever heard of a mental problem called "codependency?"Yup. Some therapist.And you have a masters degree. Uh huh.</comment>

<comment>Yup. Sure do. And you were the one who was claiming that you were already taxed? I'm merely pointing out that we weren't; as did some others, I believe. You seem to be going back and forth between what has happened to you - or so you claim - and what you are far too certain will happen to others. BTW, the daughter is intrigued that you assumed she was married. She isn't. She wants to know if he's nice. We're sitting here having a good laugh at how angry you sound. But, we're about to turn on the TV, so I will sign off.Please note that I just argue on these boards to blow off steam and have a laugh. It's all a lark to me. I treat it as a sort of verbal roller derby. Sorry about that elbow to your throat tonight. Lay off the family and we can be pals the next time we engage. Insult my husband again, and expect to be verbally chewed up and spit out. Cheers.</comment>

<comment>This is not an attempt at insult, but rather an expression of concern. If you and your husband were better parents, you would be more aware of your daughter’s activities.Her fantasies seem to be in overdrive. She keeps signing on to my website – writing that she is “moist” and “ready for the firm touch of a real man.” Is she really old enough to be doing such things?</comment>

<comment>YAWN..........</comment>

<comment>It’s good to see that you can use your mouth for something other than hysterical swearing.</comment>

<comment>Too bad you dont use yours for anything but lies. But, we all like to play on the internet - me included.</comment>

<comment>Nope, not lying. Evidence of your hysterical and unjust swearing:K2togp2tog: “You’re capable of learning, pigbitch.”K2togp2tog: “… squeeze back under the sty, pig.”K2togp2tog: “’Pigbitch’ was mild.”So, in addition to (1) your inability to understand hypothetical situations due to your ignorance, and (2) your hysterical and unjust swearing at other posters (PharmGrl) due to your arrogance, and (3) the sarcastic projection of your own adverse mental state onto others (PharmGrl), you now add (4) denial to the list of your character flaws.It must suck to be you. But even worse, it must suck for your daughter to have you as a mother.</comment>

<comment>She and I enjoyed a good laugh at your angry, and then  awkwardly sexualized, posts. You grow only more ridiculous. TA ta, enough fun for now. Pigbitch.</comment>

<comment>So, you failed to learn the meaning of the word "angry" during your Sociology studies. Not very impressive, Mrs. Humorless.And you taught your daughter to project her character flaws onto others and to wallow in such a state of denial that now she’s just as much of an arrogant prick as you and your husband.Well done!</comment>

<comment>It just occurred to me why you think sex is awkward.It’s probably because of the mistake you made years ago – you were supposed to give birth to your daughter via the vagina, not the anus.</comment>

<comment>“… it's best not to insult therapists.”Is your husband as much of a legend in his field of work as I am in mine, or is he a wuss like most therapists?</comment>

<comment>I suspect I'm far happier than your wife. </comment>

<comment>Nope – there’s no wife. I do, however, have a multitude of female sexual partners – some of whom are probably members of your own family.I cannot speak for their level of happiness, but they are all very, very satisfied.</comment>

<comment>It's nice to have fantasies, isn't it.</comment>

<comment>"It's nice to have fantasies, isn't it."You believe yourself to be an intelligent woman, don’t you?</comment>

<comment>Do you use your husband’s services as a therapist to help you deal with your comical inability to grasp hypothetical situations?Is that why you married him?</comment>

<comment>No, but we do use our senses of humor to have a good laugh at humorless conservatives. And - word to the wise- no one treats their own family. You just sound dumb. </comment>

<comment>You actually sound pretty humorless and bitter. But it's good to hear that you are getting treated elsewhere since you certainly need treatment. Your continued inability to grasp a hypothetical situation is evidence of your own mental limitation – notwithstanding the master’s degree you say you have.Is your degree in Sociology … or Gender Studies?</comment>

<comment>Ah.. .your male persona isn't any better than the female one, I see.</comment>

<comment>Ah … your ability to distinguish people isn’t any better than your ability to understand hypothetical situations, I see.</comment>

<comment>“My husband, the therapist, suggests you keep your nextappointment.”So, you’re saying that your husband doesn’t understandhypothetical situations, either, and is as much of an arrogant prick as you are?</comment>

<comment>Why should I leave her alone? She keeps leaving messageson my website – asking me to show her what a real man is like.</comment>

<comment>You bought the gay marriage lie hook line and sinker. Feeble minded </comment>

<comment>I really do not understand why you say "bought the gay marriage". I don't have a same sex marriage. I don't plan on having a same sex marriage. How is it any different than heterosexual marriage?</comment>

<comment>You are feeble minded, marriage was never about benefits. Gay marriage is benefits only. I feel bad for weak minded people like you. </comment>

<comment>Why am I weak minded? You are the one not putting forth any argument, just stating opinion. Even supposing that it were some elaborate scam of same sex couple to get lawful protection like heterosexual couples, where is the scam in that?</comment>

<comment>Jeez you are just sad, you just admited marriage is only for benefits. Take it you are not married </comment>

<comment>Perhaps you can enlighten me to what marriage has to do with government if it isn't about legal protections.</comment>

<comment>I have been trying to follow this conversation, and he is just making no sense. My earlier response to him regarding the hospital patient still stands. It's a true story, sadly.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, it totally doesn't make sense. I think he is attempting to say that homosexuals only wanted to gain protection under the law so they could gain the benefits that heterosexual couples get. Somehow he think this is a scam. Whether it is that there are no homosexuals and people are just trying to get tax breaks and adopt children or something vaguely religious I don't know.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I'm not really following it either. I don't get the "scam" angle. And as for the religious angle, I'd like to see him explain the many churches that offer marriage to same-sex couples.</comment>

<comment>It was promoted for procreation, jeez you are a feeble minded person. You must be part of lgbt</comment>

<comment>I can procreate without marriage.</comment>

<comment>Weak argument, gov found that married couples especially years ago created more kids than singles. They also noticed how much they gave up to have kids. You are not bright. Have you ever read real history? Or do you read liberal history?</comment>

<comment>I've literally said nothing about my political leanings. You are the one who has the agenda, as undecipherable as it may be. What I was getting at is that being married isn't a barrier to having children.</comment>

<comment>I feel bad you were bamboozled, you dont seem like a bad guy.</comment>

<comment>By what? Nothing was deprive of me because homosexuals can now marry. Maybe I will even get to go to a few exciting weddings that don't take place in churches.</comment>

<comment>Well its good you dont like the 1st amendment and you feel that a religious term like marriage should ne forcefully changed and infringing on peoples religious rights</comment>

<comment>It doesn't infringe on your religious liberty. You can still practice however you please. The government is not a religious institution. They can afford rights and benefits of marriage. Which it seems you believe is a scam. Being religious is not a barrier to being married.</comment>

<comment>Yes it does, if a schools starts teachig my kids marriage is anyone then it does, and my right to parent. Also forcing a baker to make a cake for a gay wedding sure does</comment>

<comment>I sure hope school teaches your child acceptance and reasoning, because you sure won't.</comment>
