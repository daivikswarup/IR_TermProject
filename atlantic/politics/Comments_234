<comment>Public polls are not in fact a necessity in politics. The relative popularity of a candidate should have no real bearing on why any individual would pick one candidate over another, so the horse race dynamics that public polling bring about are of no use to the voters, though they are a god send to the press and campaigns doing well. The "elect-ability" argument can be made without the polls, and often the actual results of elections show that those discussions are pretty useless as well.</comment>

<comment>Polling has become a lot harder in recent years.  The rise in cell phones has complicated matters because they can't be dialed directly.  Thus it is much more expensive to interview cell phone users and for monetary reasons pollsters undersample them which means projecting what cell phone users who are younger and differ in other characteristics from landline users would say which means chance fluctuations are much more important.  The other problem is the secular trend of people more and more refusing to participate in polls.  Those who agree to participate are more and more unusual and more likely to differ in their political attitudes from those who refuse.  So pollsters have to do a lot more guessing and it appears that outlying polls have become more common.  These factors could explain a lot of the difference.</comment>
