<comment>After the vice presidency, shilling for a charity is a decent job and pays the bills.Shilling for war, wall street and foreign partners pays a lot more.</comment>

<comment>I hate it when people say, "Let's end cancer!", as if it's one disease. This is a group of diseases that are very different from each other in terms of their mechanisms of action and beginnings. These are multifactorial diseases that depend on environment and individual susceptibility. The keys to cancer cures are hidden in genomic engineering, and that opens up many more, very serious ethical arguments. For the time being, until we can fully and selectively edit the human genome (a good example is the recent advances in gene editing with cas 9 protein) in an affordable way, this billion dollars should be spent on screening and education. They may find some useful medications, but they will be expensive and experimental for decades, making them useless to the lower classes, which is the social class most affected by cancers. It's not fair that tax money is spent on treatments that the common people cannot afford.</comment>

<comment>They can't afford it now, obviously. But you have to start somewhere. Experimental tech will obviously be more expensive, but once refined can be mass produced cheaply.</comment>

<comment>We all know the evil pharmaceutical companies have known how to cure cancer for decades and there are thousands of people who are intentionally hiding the cure so they can make money. Sarcasm off. 1 billion dollars is less money that pharmaceutical companies take to develop one drug to treat one specific type of cancer. I'm assuming the federal government will spend twice as much for the same results. There is no "cure" for cancer like there is for pathogenic diseases, so we need to stop treating it as such.</comment>

<comment>I wish VP Biden all the best.  It's an admirable goal and even if he is able to make only incremental enhancements to the R&D and approval processes, it will be valuable.</comment>

<comment>Having just lost my mother to cancer and many other friends and family - ANYTHING that they do is better than nothing. Maybe if we spent as much time and money on cancer as erection or hair loss pills.PLEASE help a disabled veteran who lost his wife(cancer) and son www.gofundme.com/robertstreich</comment>

<comment>My sister decided to stop treatment of her cancer after she went through her entire savings, 401(k), and still amassed a debt equal to a mortgage to fight her systematic cancer that started as Hodgkin's. "Curing" cancer is moot unless it's accessible to all and affordable to all.</comment>

<comment>To answer the question in the headline, the answer is that power corrupts. You have to have the unique combination of hubris and naivety only present in administrators and politicians to aspire to a goal like "cure cancer". Fortunately, Joe seems to be a bit more realistic in his aspirations as he demonstrated with his quote about there not being a silver bullet. "Cancer" as we know it, is very likely not one disease and has many, many different etiologies.</comment>

<comment>Cancer is a terrible disease. Anything that can be done to find a permanent cure for all types of cancer must be done. Hey! Was that Ben Carson in the photo with Joe? He must have got out the race and jumped right back into a job.</comment>

<comment>The problem with a "war on cancer" or "cancer moonshot" is that cancer isn't a single, unified disease. There are probably thousands of different cancers, which have very different genetic/molecular pathways and treatment targets. What works for breast cancer might not work for prostate, lung, etc, etc, cancer. For people with advanced disease, even the most effective therapies often only end up extending survival time by a few weeks or months. "Cancer moonshot" sounds nice, but $1 billion isn't going to advance the field very much or get pharma researchers to release their proprietary data.</comment>

<comment>Well if there anyone who can solve cancer it is a professional politician. I mean, look at all the success we have had in the other "wars" and moon shots...War on Poverty War on DrugsWar on TerrorWar on Cancer (1971)Education Reform (pick your version)Healthcare Reform (pick your version)It is not that our Federal Government cannot or should not play an important role number of these issues. It is more a question of whether the Federal Government fix all of them simultaneously.Perhaps the Federal Government isn't as omnipotent as some would have us believe. Perhaps, I know this is going to be a stretch for some of you, perhaps, like every organization on the planet, we should ask the US Federal government to tackle a few discrete manageable problems with clear goals, instead of asking it to fix every imaginable injustice and perceived problem. Instead, perhaps if we asked it do less if could actually accomplish more and in so doing people's confidence in this institution would improve!Just a thought and it is not a particularly political one or ideological one; it is a practical, pragmatic suggestion.</comment>

<comment>It's a democracy, so you need 50+1 to agree on something. Everyone wants a piece, and has their own priorities.</comment>

<comment>True, but that what happens when the Federal budget becomes a rent seeking pi√±ata. As Alex de Toqueville wisely said:The American Republic will endure until the day Congress discovers that it can bribe the public with the public's money.Democracy is fatally flawed. </comment>

<comment>Is this a joke?Big Business will NEVER allow Americans to remove the thousands of known carcinogens from our daily lives.Biden knows this as well as I do.</comment>

<comment>I do not doubt the sincerity or emotional connection that Obama/Biden may have towards this cause. But it really is the epitome of governing based on intentions alone.</comment>

<comment>Young guy gives old guy something to do that he can't screw up, because he isn't involved. </comment>

<comment>A third to fifth the cost of a new pharmaceutical? Jesus Christ.</comment>

<comment>obama could not care less</comment>

<comment>What a Hypocrite Biden is....He supports and has supported the SLAUGHTER OF INNOCENT CHILDREN in the womb for years on end and here he is appearing to be oh so good by making an effort to end cancer....Why don't you try to be even a real Catholic Biden and stop supporting Child murder is my question??</comment>
