<comment>Seems like something we should explore, but along with actually holding people accountable when they drop the ball.</comment>

<comment>Jackson Ms. is the next one.</comment>

<comment>"Open-source governance would not only give people more power, but also more responsibility—not to overreact to every grim data set, for example, and to support new systems and institutions that set data free."You're way more optimistic than me.  I mean, have you ever read a comments section?</comment>

<comment>Have you checked out the Uncensored News and Views channel?They are a bunch of homophobic hate mongers. It’s truly disgusting what they say. I implore all open-minded people to pay them a visit and tell them how you feel!!https://disqus.com/home/channe...</comment>

<comment>So you are advertising for them, eh?</comment>

<comment>Yeah. I thought I'd do them a favor. They have so few followers and seem like a really lackluster channel. The boost could really do them good.</comment>

<comment>Free data would overwhelm people in an avalanche of useless information.  Experts would immediately be called in to sort out the useful nuggets of knowledge from the noise and make sense of it.  Since these experts are not on the government payroll, they would be even less accountable then the bureacrats.That said, free data will always be an improvement over secrets.  It will be a small incremental improvement.  Don't expect it to be a panacea and don't expect to saverify money cutting the government payroll.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing less accountable than a bureaucrat.</comment>

<comment>Simple ..... don't elect democrats like they did in Flint</comment>

<comment>Only it was the Republicans that poisoned the water.</comment>

<comment>No it wasn't. Democrats have ruled MI foe decades.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but the water wasn't poisoned for decades. Key decisions were made that poisoned the water, and republicans fingerprints are all over those decisions. </comment>

<comment>Very interesting.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>You haven't been keeping up with Michigan politics, have you? The poisoning the water happened in the last few years, under Snyder's watch, and as a result of his decisions.</comment>

<comment>I'm not looking to defend Snyder, but will point out there were a series of "ands" involved in the cluster-mutter that is Flint's water situation.  Any one of which going another way would have resulted in a different outcome.  It can be thought to begin in 2010 when the committee to oversee creating the KWA came into being, chaired by the then-Mayor of Flint.  Then there was the 7-1 vote of the city council to approve connecting to the KWA upon completion of a pipeline which should be finished some time this year.  Then there was Detroit's unsurprising reaction to learning they were indeed going to be losing customers accounting for 10% of the water they delivered but covering 20% of the costs.  Then we have the Flint reaction to that to go to the long-standing backup supply of the Flint River - and the then-Mayor of Flint lending his enthusiastic voice, and button-pressing finger to the ceremony celebrating the cut-over to the Flint River supply.  And of course, it all goes downhill from there.  The Wikipedia article one can find via "KWA water" will cover the committee bits and the vote, and there is an LA Times article discussing the ceremony of the switchover and lots of other matters.Edit: And while all this was happening and before, the city of Lansing MI had started a program in 2004 to replace lead supply lines in their system.   DC started something similar in 2005.  While the folks responsible for Flint's water system in the mid-2000s might not have heard about what was happening in DC, it seems highly unlikely they didn't know about what was happening in Lansing.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, but the lead-based pipes and the chemicals in the water didn't get there overnight...</comment>

<comment>I disagree with the idea that a "less paternalistic" government is "not smaller nor bigger." Ultimately, the case that this author quite eloquently makes is one for a smaller, more empowering government that promotes citizen participation, transparency, and accountability. As a small-government conservative, I concur.</comment>

<comment>Why is lead even allowed to be used in circumstances where it can leach into water? Isn't there a better alternative than lead for pipes and solder? </comment>

<comment>Because it costs "too much" to replace all the old pipes that used lead.</comment>

<comment>Where, if Lansing MI's experience since 2004 is accurate, is about $2000 per line.  They started at something like $3100 and got more efficient at it as they went.  I believe that DC's per-line cost was a little higher - perhaps in the $3000s.</comment>

<comment>Next? Wow, the selective outrage has fried brains. Pick any coal town. Any town from the east coast rust belt. Any rural area where there is fracking. But I guess the demographics and politics are never right in those places. </comment>

<comment>What are you saying, that if high levels of lead were found in some city/town in Iowa no one would care?</comment>

<comment>Only if the demographics were right; remember, this has become another race bating issue. And there would have to be a Republican government to point fingers at. Right now I know at least a dozen people from my home state that have had gag orders placed on them from the Obama DoJ over fracking that has polluted their water. When you have people with water that catches on fire being gagged by the same govt that is making a spectacle out of Flint, that is hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>What are you saying, that if high levels of lead were found in some city/town in Iowa no one would care?</comment>

<comment>You want to prevent another episode of improperly treated water in a municipal system, especially one that is (on the fly, and 100%) changing their feedstock?  How about if the employees of the municipal water department do their jobs?  How about if the quality control crew actually pays attention to the industry best practices when they contemplate managing the feedstock change?  What if those employees (who may not be the most qualified people) ask for the help of other people in the business, the ones that belong to the professional water treatment organization that they probably have a certificate from on the wall of the office of the department QC head?  What if the employees did what they get paid to do, including asking for help to ensure that they are doing the right thing, adding the right chemical balancers and buffers?  Is that too much to ask from our dedicated, irreplaceable "first responder" municipal employees and managers?  If these people had done their jobs properly, none of this mess would have ever occurred.  Flint would still be an impoverished dump with a boatload of socioeconomic problems, and there would still be a bunch of lead water supply lines in the dirt, but the basic issue would not have occurred.Now it is all politics all the time, and not a clean hand to be found in the Dem or Republican side.  It could all have been avoided had the employees done the job they get paid to do.  Don't forget that.</comment>

<comment>Oh, ffs, Ron.This was not a failure of technology, not even a failure of government.Right at this very moment, all across America, there are small and large cities delivering clean fresh water to millions of people with such routine efficiency, that the local water board is synonymous with "boring".Delivering water is not rocket science, it isn't some remarkable mystery that no one can figure out. The government in this case simply didn't care enough to make it a priority.A new whizbang app isn't going to fix that.</comment>

<comment>No, but the whizbang app might let me know the water is poison 6 months before the government does because it is twiddling its thumbs trying to figure out what to do.</comment>

<comment>Don't put  your faith in it; the government will just hack the results shown the to people. Like the fake waiting lists the VA produced showing that they were giving timely care to veterans.</comment>

<comment>I suspect you would end-up replacing "Aim, aim, aim, um, what were we doing again?" With "Fire! Fire! Fire! Now what were we supposed to be aiming at?"</comment>

<comment>Put White people in charge.  We'll make it happen.</comment>

<comment>White people ain't what they used to be . . .</comment>

<comment>I'll just stick to doing everything important myself or through a private entity I have vetted instead of trusting a bloated, inept, partisan, corrupt, unaccountable, and un-transparent government to do it badly for me.  Unfortunately there is one bridge I don't really have an alternative but to cross (the downside to islands), but luckily its only about 15 feet off the water so I won't likely plunge to my death if it collapses due to deferred maintenance.Yes, I have my own water source.  Yes, I treat it and test it even though it has always been safe to drink straight out of the ground .I've even had food I've purchased tested.  I also generate my own power.  I don't grow all my own food, but I personally know most of the farmers that do.</comment>

<comment>As welfare states crumble their services implodeThis was entirely foreseeableThe problem was the debt not any of the nonsense that you are talking about</comment>

<comment>Hey Ron, are  you finally bailing on the Blue State Model?</comment>

<comment>There is a fire burning at a nuclear waste dump in the middle of St. Louis, MO.It continues to burn because thus far no one has been able to shout loudly enough."Accountability" isn't just about blame: it's about having one person who can say "This is a problem, here is how we fix it" then coordinate the solution.</comment>

<comment>Send those responsible to the Hague and have them tried for genocide.We may have to build some more prisons for the good folks in the Hague, but we are expert at that.</comment>

<comment>Obama promised to fundamentally transform America.In a world full of hungry people, most Americans need to lose a few pounds;In a world where millions have no access to clean water, we use it to wash our cars;Our pets have better healthcare than half the people on the planet.What did these Democrat voters think fundamental transformation meant?  Now, lose some weight and sign up for Obamacare.  Welcome to the third world.</comment>
