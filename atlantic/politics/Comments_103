<comment>Finally. Now if they would only stop sitting on their hands and do something about fluoridated water.</comment>

<comment>Pass the aluminum foil! </comment>

<comment>Fluoridated water is just a false flag to draw attention from chemtrails</comment>

<comment>And the chemtrails are just a ploy to distract us from the fake moon landings. Those landings were a ploy to distact us from the lizard people who have a base on the moon.</comment>

<comment>Would that be the same lizard people who shot JFK?</comment>

<comment>I tell ya, the things ya learn on the internet web tubey things.</comment>

<comment>No those are the lizard people who rule England</comment>

<comment>Ironically, that actually wasn't a conspiracy. The real conspiracy is that the power's that be want people to question the JFK assassination as a distraction from the FEMA camps</comment>

<comment>Why yes, it would.</comment>

<comment>All the conspiracies are just smoke to cover from the REAL conspiracy.That Obama took over Texas with Jade Helm and stole everyones guns</comment>

<comment>Actually the veto may not matter.  The Affordable Care Act is already collapsing under its own weight.   United Healthcare, the nation's largest insurer, has indicated that they will stop offering coverage and 12 state co-ops have already folded because the benefits insurers are paying out exceeds the premium being collected.  Next year when the government subsidies to insurance companies cease, even more insurers will discontinue offering coverage.  </comment>

<comment>You need to do more research</comment>

<comment>For someone assigning me research, your post is bereft of any data or facts.If you set politics aside and look at what's happening objectively, you'll quickly realize that what this massive Spruce Goose piece of legislation promised to do simply isn't happening.  HHS predicted 20,000,000 new enrolled.   Fewer than half of that have actually enrolled.  Guess who signed up first?  Sick people.   Guess who haven't enrolled?  The healthy -- whose premiums are vital to offset the costs of insuring the sick.  UHC is the nation's biggest insurer and they can't make this work.  A dozen smaller co-ops have already folded.  In 2016 UHC will stop marketing and PAYING COMMISSIONS to insurance agents for selling ACA policies.  Which means there will be less competition, which means premiums will increase.</comment>

<comment>Commissions?  That seems so out of date somehow - like the bad job some guy has at the start of an early 60s movie.I'm assuming such antiquated practices are just for selling plans to employers?</comment>

<comment>Commissions are how insurance companies pay the people who sell their products.  So whether you are 65 and buying your Medicare supplement or 50 and buying your ACA policy, the insurance company pays agents to enroll you.  The commission is fixed so no matter what product they use the agent earns the same rate.  Of course, once UHC stops commissions, agents, co-ops, and entire agencies will stop selling their product-- which is what UHC wants.  </comment>

<comment>I believe you, but it just reeks of anachronism.  I don't think I know anybody who actually has contact with an "agent" anymore.</comment>

<comment>I believe you, but it just reeks of anachronism.  I don't think I know anybody who actually has contact with an "agent" anymore.My wife works in a call center as an insurance agent for a major national health insurance carrier. She makes a very decent living selling Medicare supplemental coverage (and nothing else) to technophobic seniors who call  in from their land lines after seeing her company's toll-free number during Fox News commercial breaks.One of the best things about her career is the extremely high level of job security - even as more and more Boomers become eligible for Medicare each year and enroll, her job cannot be outsourced to a call center overseas due to requirements by state-level regulatory bodies that the licensed sales agent be an American citizen.Although I disagree completely with Valyrian Steel's opinions on the Affordable Care Act, his/her description of the insurance sales process is quite accurate.</comment>

<comment>"her description of the insurance sales process is quite accurate"Again, veracity's not the issue - it's more about the vulgarity of it all.  I mean, when you explain:"She makes a very decent living selling Medicare supplemental coverage (and nothing else) to technophobic seniors who call in from their land lines after seeing her company's toll-free number during Fox News commercial breaks"all I hear is, "She's incentivized to fleece rubes."*  Why not just pay her a fixed salary?  The commission structure still seems of another time - not to mention ripe for abuse.**  While I'm sure that your wife can find ways to spurn greed, why have that temptation exist at all?As an aside, I've got to ask, how is the insurance package offered by your wife's employer?*  Although, frankly, if "a very decent living" means more than 60k a year, I also hear, "There's that waste/inefficiency in the system that costs us all."** Commissions for mortgage agents in the 90s and 00s come to mind.</comment>

<comment>Being a commissioned salesperson/sales supervisor, I've got to firmly disagree. Being paid a commission rate is truly the most honest form of compensation. You write your own check; Work harder, and you can make more.</comment>

<comment>Where's this agent when I'm enrolling online?</comment>

<comment>With or without an agent your premium is the same for health insurance.  Not true for life insurance. </comment>

<comment>just the fact that you "sell" something that should be a right, so that someone can make a living is just skeevy in the extreme.</comment>

<comment>I don't sell insurance. But that's how it works.Is it "skeevy in the extreme" to buy food, water, shelter and clothing too?  </comment>

<comment> just the fact that you "sell" something that should be a right, so that someone can make a living is just skeevy in the extreme.My wife is a liberal Democrat who sells health insurance for a living. If you were ever to meet her, "skeevy" is absolutely completely the last word you would use to describe her. She loves gardening, cooking, knitting, cats, wearing sensible shoes, reading science fiction, and video games with dragons in them. She also loves not being unemployed, flat broke, and depressed.</comment>

<comment>Research why the co-ops have folded. It is because the promised refunds did not materialize. I have in the past spent countless hours Googlilng and providing links to people with closed minds, so all I can say is do some more research. I am done.</comment>

<comment>You're almost right.The federal subsidy is les than expected but it is still being received. Next year it will be phased out completely.   Claims will remain unsupported by low enrollment premiums so the number of insurers losing money will accelerate and more companies will exit the space.Then we'll see what happens when there are no insurance companies willing to  go bankrupt for feel good legislation that has never and will never square with economic realty.   </comment>

<comment>You overly simplify and exaggerate.</comment>

<comment>Well it is simple.  The government is subsidizing ACA claims in 2015.  They will stop subsidizing claims in 2016.  A dozen insurers have already folded with the subsidy.  More will fold without it.Where's the exaggeration?  </comment>

<comment>A dozen co-ops, not a dozen insurers. The co-ops are formed purposely for ACA. Typical RW twist: confound and conflate facts.</comment>

<comment>Do you understand that a co-op  is a mutual insurance company?  You lack basic knowledge of the issue and accuse me of twisting things.Read the link below.  The Land of Lincoln health mutual insurance company is the Illinois co-op.  It hasn't failed yet but it will in 2016. When federal funds dry up.http://insurancenewsnet.com/oa...</comment>

<comment>Also here is the article you probably base your claims on (http://www.usatoday.com/story/... You need to read the whole thing. It is hardly a claim that the whole thing is falling apart, simply the United Healthcare isn't rolling in huge extortionate profits and figures it would do better to insure healthy people.Of course, the real answer is single payer, and a national health care system such as they have in most of the civilized world.  And don't cite Switzerland, since it is a tightly regulated market.</comment>

<comment>Of course your answer is single payer!That's why computers, televisions, and life insurance keeps getting cheaper because a single source government controlled monopoly dictates the "correct" price for those goods and services.  </comment>

<comment>Yay, non sequiturs!  Let me try:  Of course the answer is an unfettered free market!  That's why the United States has the highest lowest intergenerational socioeconomic mobility of any highly developed nation!</comment>

<comment>Speaking of non sequiturs, you respond to an ACA article and discussion of robust competition dropping costs by defaulting to your pet topic of "woe is me, I'm unhappy, I'm unemployed, I have zero agency in my own life and I have the data to prove why I'm unhappy, unemployed and have zero agency in my own life".Okay counselor, I'll take your bait.  First of all, the data is clear: Intergenerational social mobility in the US is unchanged for the past 20 years.  So no whining that kids born in the 70s had  it better than kids born in the 90s.http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014...Secondly the biggest determining factor in mobility is education -- regardless of country.  So while the Scandinavian countries have the most mobility and  the US has the least the biggest determining factor in all countries is still education attainment.Which brings us to a fundamental difference between Sweden and the USA.  Sweden is one of the most ethnically homogenous countries on earth.  The US is diverse.  So in the Chicago public schools( where 20 percent of Illinois children are educated) out of 400,000 students,   64,000 of them do not speak English as their first language.  A student whose parents have little to no English are at a significant academic disadvantage to students whose parents are fluent in English.   This disparity is non existent in a Stockholm school.   </comment>

<comment>“Sweden is one of the most ethnically homogenous countries on earth.”No, it isn't. It was. One sixth of the population is foreign born, not to mention the recent influx of migrants, some of whom may stay.</comment>

<comment>The country that contributes the most migrants to Sweden is Finland (a country that has two nationally recognized languages including Swedish).  The people migrating to Sweden are doing so legally.Contrast that to the US.  Most of our immigrants are from Mexico, come here illegally and do not speak English.Who has a better chance academically? A Mexican kid here illegally whose parents don't speak English.  Or a Finnish kid in Sweden.  Bear in mind that the education index for Finland is .81 and Mexico is .63 (1 would be a perfectly educated population).Given the challenges faced in the US it's incredible that our economic mobility has stayed as strong as it has.  </comment>

<comment>My point was not to compare Finnish immigrants in Sweden to Mexican ones in the US. My point was that you significantly misstated a fact.The one about Finland contributing the most migrants may be true, but it's badly misleading, since the vast majority come from countries other that Finland, and a significant number come from outside Europe.I take no position here about the extent to which demographic variety contributes to poorer health outcomes or economic immobility. Regardless of the actual number of immigrants, a relevant comparison might compare Middle Eastern immigrants in Sweden to Mexican ones in the US.</comment>

<comment>Whatevs. Anyone with any economics savvy knows that healthcare is not a divisible good that can be sold in discrete units.</comment>

<comment>Do you understand that healthcare isn't synonymous with health insurance and that healthcare absolutely is divisible and sold in discreet units.Look at a hospital invoice sometime or talk to a medical coder.  </comment>

<comment>Healthcare is sold in discreet units precisely because of our disconnected system.  This is not the case in all other western nations (or rather, health care is sold in other places in larger discreet units).</comment>

<comment>That's when Medicare will step in and show the insurance companies how to do it far more efficiently than they could have dreamed of.  That's when congress will have to step in and finally allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices from the entirely out of whack gougers in the pharmaceuticals industry. And so on and so forth.  Next!</comment>

<comment>Are you seriously holding Medicare up as a financially successful government program.   It is unsustainable.  </comment>

<comment>It is unsustainable because we won't fund it properly, not because it is inefficient or problematic.You can't cut something off at the knees and then point and say "ha, I told you it can't walk".</comment>

<comment>Medicare is far more efficient than private insurance companies.  That's a fact, not an opinion.  Do you seriously believe that the GOP kept Medicare out of the equation for any other reason than it would hurt private insurance interests?</comment>

<comment>Lol.  So is blue cross more efficient when it is called Medicare?  </comment>

<comment>had medicaid expansion taken place in ALL the states that figure would be more of a reality.</comment>

<comment>Compare the credit ratings of the 30 states that expanded Medicaid to the twenty who didn't.  The balance sheet doesn't lie.EDIT: Except in CA and IL - - they are unable to forecast their state pension liabilities within $100,000,000,000 (100 BILLION dollars).  </comment>

<comment>That will be a legal disaster. Having trained and supervised plenty of salespeople, they tend to avoid work they aren't paid for. You will see plenty who will be turned away because the salespeople don't want the hassle. Tantamount to discrimination.</comment>

<comment>I needed something funny this morning, thank you!. :-) </comment>

<comment>If you think that's funny you should have listened to the UHC quarterly conference call.  The 550,000 ACA policies placed in force lost them $700,000,000 or .45/share.A real laugh riot.  The federal government is hilarious at executing the laws of unintended consequences.  Obamacare is almost as hysterical as Dodd-Frank whose burdensome compliance regulations are so expensive that local and regional banks have been forced to sell out to the multinationals.  Goldman, JPM, WELLS Fargo, Bank of America and Citi aren't just bigger as a result of Dodd Frank -- they are much, much BIGGER.   </comment>

<comment>Did they mention the salary of UHC's CEO? How much does that affect the sacred shares?</comment>

<comment>Very little.</comment>

<comment>You had me with the ACA until you went on to attack Dodd-Frank. Now I know exactly who you are. </comment>

<comment>I'm someone who dislikes bad legislation.Did Dodd Frank make banks "too big too fail", bigger or smaller?  The big banks are bigger than ever before.Did the Aca make your family's health insurance premiums go up or down?    If you are like most middle class families your premiums increased and your deductible went up too! </comment>

<comment>I believe what you say of the ACA, but it had zero effect on our premiums. Zero.Dodd frank is not a gem, but it is better than nothing. I'm sorry that there wasn't more support to make it worthwhile legislation, but Dodd-Frank became partisan almost immediately.You are welcome to your opinion, as I am to mine.Cheers. </comment>

<comment>It had a HUGE effect on my premiums.  I'm now paying $860 a month for coverage for one person.  I was paying half that much through private insurance.  On dental, this year I paid $48 a month through private insurance.  Next year, through ACA, I get to pay $57 a month for exactly the same plan.</comment>

<comment>Then you have a gold plan plus now.But then you knew that. You just wanted to pretend sumptin' or sumptin'.</comment>

<comment>How did both premiums and deductibles go up but insurers lose money?</comment>

<comment>I can't tell if you are being sarcastic  or if you genuinely don't understand.So I'm going to answer:  claims under ACA policies are extremely high.  Imagine if car insurance companies had to charge everyone the same premium regardless of driving history.  The drivers Ed teacher who has never had an accident and the town drunk with 3 dui s both owe State Farm $1,000 per year  in premium.  The drunk is thrilled.  The driver Ed teacher isn't.  Now suppose your good drivers opt out and buy a bike or a bus pass and your drunks pay premium.  At first you collect nothing but premium but everyone these drunks pay $1,000 in premium they cause $3,900 of damage that State Farm has to pay in claims.That's what happened to UHC -- they lost $700,000,000 on 550,000 Obamacare policies or paid $1,200 more in claims than they collected in premiums.There is only one entity dysfunctional enough to operate that way financially.  Our government.  </comment>

<comment>Oh, so just like in the car insurance example, some people just shouldn't do the insured activity.  In this case, living.Not only is your single data point not particularly illuminating--why did UHC lose that money? is everyone losing money?--even if you were right on the facts and the analysis, the conclusion is that we should have a single payer system.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  You are not a business person are you?In car insurance your rate is determined by your age, gender,  driving experience and the car insured.  You don't pay corvette premiums if you only need insurance on a Honda Civic.Obamacare dictates a rate despite the experience and requires everyone have insurance for labor and delivery  (including men and 50 year old women) and children's dental insurance (including people without children) so everyone pays a corvette premium even if they only need Honda coverage.As for your claim that I cited a single data point, I actually referenced UHC and the 12 out of 23 not for profit state exchanges that have folded up.</comment>

<comment>You haven't responded to my point.  If a large percentage of people shouldn't have health insurance at the rates they're getting--and didn't have health insurance prior to the ACA, because they couldn't afford the rates offered--then what do you do with those people?  Just let them die?As for your oh woe is the insurance companies nonsense, the fact that some insurers are folding now doesn't mean a lot to me.  It's a tough economy out there and has been for a while.  Let's say, arguendo, that a bunch of insurers are going out of business.  So what?  As long as the number of insured remains the same or increases, I don't really care how many businesses are providing the service.  Insurers folding or exiting the business is perfectly consistent with a reading that the law has, as every non-partisan analysis says, reduced growth in costs and reduced the dead-weight loss rent extracted by insurers.</comment>

<comment>Since costs don't matter to you, you don't have a point worth responding to.  </comment>

<comment>Where did I say costs don't matter?  I said that costs are increasing more slowly due to the ACA, which is true.  I said that businesses going out of businesses is part of business and nothing to get hysterical over, which is true.  I said that the number of insured has increased, which is true, and that as long as remaining insurers manage to insure a greater number of people than the status quo ante, then it's a win, which is true.But moreover, and my main point from jump, is that even if your chicken little hysteria is true and the insurers are all going "exit the business" (like the capitalists Going Galt in Atlas Shrugged, I guess they won't be replaced because in this one, specific space nature and economics do not abhor a vacuum), then what that means is that private insurance is an unworkable system and must be replaced by single payer coverage.  Your options are (a) let lots of people suffer without medical care, which was the pre-ACA situation, and suffer crippling medical costs both on an individual and societal level or (b) have a single-payer system like almost every other civilized nation in the world, including fiscal stalwarts like Germany.  Your own example demonstrates the idiocy of treating health insurance like other forms of insurance.  If I can't afford car insurance, I can't afford a car, but that's okay, because not everyone needs a car.  Even if you live somewhere that makes cars a necessity, you can at least move.  No one can forego non-elective healthcare.  Break a bone, you have to get it set.  Get badly burned, you need a skin graft.  Develop an infection, you need antibiotics.You act as though we had a functioning healthcare system pre-ACA, and that all flaws of the system are new and caused by the ACA.  The fact is that we've never had a system in this country that functioned up to current standards.  The ACA--you sound like a buffoon calling it "Obamacare," by the way--has almost without exception improved the system over what preceded it.  It's not perfect, it's not even the best we could do, but people like you are the reason for that.</comment>

<comment>They didn't lose money--there just not making it at the 26% profit margin they were a few years ago.</comment>

<comment>My premiums have gone up less in the last few years than they did in the years before the ACA.  Is that the ACA's fault?  Thanks Obama :)</comment>

<comment>again. It is the insurance companies that make the rates. They would be much higher but the ACA actually makes the ins co justify any rate increases 10% or above. Insurance rates have been going up for the past 2 decades. The increases are less than they have been in the past.Hey.  Obama wanted Universal Health care. He got what he could get. We all know this is not perfect but we NEED to be able to have access to health care and the GOP does not care if you have access or not. They have done NOTHING for decades. Why not?Why get mad at the guy who is trying to help and not mad at the ones who thought the status quo was perfectly acceptable.</comment>

<comment>Because throwing gasoline on a fire isn't "helping".  </comment>

<comment>UHC's a minor player in most exchange markets, despite being the largest insurer in the nation. This doesn't change much. That being said, the ACA contains compromises that leave most people on both sides with mixed feelings. The law would have done better to focus more on mechanisms to force insurers to cut reimbursements and thereby deliver better value to America's beleaguered private insurance customers.</comment>

<comment>We are still waiting for your or the Republican Party's alternative. I expect to hear nothing other than crickets.</comment>

<comment>I posted it above but here you go again:http://mobile.philly.com/news/...It encapsulates the Bush plan pretty well.  The biggest difference is that it provides more choice which reduces costs significantly.  Also instead of federal subsidies it provides tax credits to make individuals more empowered consumers.Don't forget, Obamacare is so terrible that 60% of the target population would rather be unidirectional and pay a fine/tax than utilize this program.  </comment>

<comment>Could you please send me a postcard from the universe that you live in? Please use a very pretty stamp so that I can put it into my collection. Thank you. :-)</comment>

<comment>Hm, finally here's the agenda."The biggest difference is that it provides more choice which reduces costs significantly."That is, we can go back to charging women more for health, etc., and shake our heads sadly at (or, perhaps, just smugly disdain?) those who aren't rich enough to keep alive."Also instead of federal subsidies it provides tax credits to make individuals more empowered consumers."Ah! Tax breaks for the rich, not help for the poor.With regard to your last paragraph, given that your position is that almost everyone else here is completely clueless about Obamacare, doesn't that put special sauce on your fallacy of appealing to polls of an aggressively misinformed populace?</comment>

<comment>Do you understand the difference between a tax cut and a tax credit?  Tax cuts benefit the rich more than the poor.  A tax credit benefits the poor more than the rich.As for choice in healthcare, women of child bearing age should pay more for health insurance because they receive more claims.  It's just like a sixteen your old boy with 3 speeding tickets should pay more for car insurance than the 55 year old lady who hasn't been pulled over or had an accident in 20 years.</comment>

<comment>What exactly happened to the Single Payer Plan that Obama gave us?</comment>

<comment>Great.  So once the insurance companies understand that we're tired of for-profit companies interfering with public health, we can pave the way to a single-payer system the way that almost every other developed nation handles healthcare.</comment>

<comment>The GOP (and conservative Democrats) will block this from ever happening.  They hate the ACA, but they hate nationalized healthcare programs even more.</comment>

<comment>Let's abolish profit in healthcare!Instead of having highly trained physicians that have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on schooling, and pharmaceutical companies that spend billions on R&D, and medical device companies that manufacture $1,000,000 pieces equipment that can see into our bodies, we could all save a lot of money if witch doctors chanted incantations and leeched us to get our humors in balance.  </comment>

<comment>Is that how Europe does medicine? Oh wait, it isnt and they have government health care, trained physicians, the same equipment, and LESS cost.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, their physicians just go to college for medicine and don't spend an additional four years in school and incur hundreds of thousands of dollars of high interest debt that they then labor under as debt peons for years before having the opportunity to make a reasonable income, forcing them to choose between vows of poverty (loan forgiveness programs that take at least a decade) or pursuit of high paying positions.So as you can see the American system clearly makes more sense.</comment>

<comment>So, B. Acre, my son-in-law is a surgeon who has been in practice less than 15 years out of med school, and just announced that he had just become a millionaire. The system works just fine for physicians and insurance companies, but not so much for everyone else. That's one reason the US has the most expensive health care system, the United States ranks last overall among 11 industrialized countries on measures of health system quality, efficiency, access to care, equity, and healthy lives, according to a new Commonwealth Fund report. The other countries included in the study were Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand Norway, Sweden Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. While there is room for improvement in every country, the U.S. stands out for having the highest costs and lowest performance—the U.S. spent $8,508 per person on health care in 2011, compared with $3,406 in the United Kingdom, which ranked first overall</comment>

<comment>No, not the same equipment: it's rationed.  Doctors are rationed, too.  There can be only so many per population.  The fees doctors are allowed to charge don't allow them a living wage.  Why spend years in medical school to make less than a plumber?  Try living in a socialized medicine country.  Try being seriously ill in a socialized medicine country.</comment>

<comment>Really? Most European countries have equal or better health outcomes than the US. Heck, even Cuba does better. Ya, I think you're BSing again.</comment>

<comment>Doctors not only make a living wage in countries with socialized medicine, they make far more than those with similar education levels. Sure they don't make as much as doctors in the US, but that doesn't mean they're poor, they're just less rich. The average general practitioner in Germany makes 113,000 euro (or about $123,000) a year. If you don't think that's a living wage than I question your grip on reality"Rationing" only applies to non-life threatening situations, which happens in the United States as well. I think it's funny how people who criticize socialized medicine never mention that insurance companies and hospitals in the United States also ration and prioritize procedures. Elective surgeries for instance get a low priority, but if your appendix bursts in Europe you're going to get surgery immediately just like in the United States.And yes, I have lived in a country with socialized medicine and have had the opportunity to use both the US and German healthcare system for the same problem. It was eye opening. I grew up fairly conservative and so I heard all those lies you and others are spreading: that there would be long waits, that the equipment would be substandard, that the doctors wouldn't be as good. You know what the difference was? Fewer unnecessary tests. I came in for kidney stones and the American doctors ordered round after round of bloodwork, urine samples, mri's and even a sonogram tor rule out testicular cancer. Why? I have no idea, the doctor just told me to, even though she knew it was a kidney stone. That never happened in Germany, I came in, told them I had a kidney stone. They looked for it and found it and scheduled the procedure for the next week. It's true that German hospitals don't have as nice lobbies as hospitals in the states, so there's that. Surprisingly though the doctors in Germany also listened to me more; the doctors in the states usually came in, read my chart, my test results, talked at me for about twenty seconds and left. The German doctors actually talked with me,which was confusing having grown up in the American system. Waiting times were the same, although I never waited for three hours for an MRI like I did in the states. The lobbies were more crowded but somehow I never seemed to wait any longer.Oh, and it cost me only a fraction in Germany as it would have in the US. In Germany it cost me about $3,000. That was just the cost of the tests in the US. The price they quoted me, which assumed the procedure wouldn't have to be repeated and there would be no hospital stay, was $20,000. Exact same procedure, exact same equipment. In fact the procedure and the lithotripsy machine were invented in Germany decades ago.When I read stuff like this I'm reminded of the article in Investor's Business Daily that said: "People such as scientist Stephen Hawking wouldn’t have a chance in the U.K., where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man, because of his physical handicaps, is essentially worthless.” Of course the author was unaware (somehow) that Stephen Hawking is from the U.K. and has been kept alive by the National Health Service. Stephen Hawking responded "I wouldn't be here today if it were not for the NHS. I have received a large amount of high-quality treatment without which I would not have survived." Like most attacks on socialized medicine, this one and yours is so disconnected from reality it is difficult to really even nail down all the ways it's wrong. The United States pays more for less across the board. Outcomes are worse and prices are astronomical. Not only that but we pay more in taxes to support our healthcare system then many countries like Australia does with their socialized medicine. It is insanity and your'e defending a corrupt broken system with lies, innuendo and fear.</comment>

<comment>Just an ad-on.A few years ago, on the eve of Obamacare, i needed rotator cuff surgery. I phoned around trying to find who would charge what. Not one surgeon, anesthetist, OP Clinic, or hospital could tell me what they charged. Even the insurance company wouldn't tell me what their pay out was.In February I had cataract surgery. Again, I called various eye surgeons, anesthetists, clinics and hospitals. Same thing, not one would tell me what they charged. Although my wife works in the medical field, the assigned hospital and insurance carrier wouldn't tell me what I would be paying my end.Now how on earth can anyone make an informed decision when they can't find out the most basic of things, the cost.</comment>

<comment>an MRI in Japan costs 99.00. Here is over a 1000.00. Why?</comment>

<comment>The US isn't ranked very high in healthcare outcomes compared to our industrialized neighbors who offer single payer systems. Medicare seems to be a popular program after all...And other countries don't dismantle insurance markets - you can still buy private insurance if you want to.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, why don't you ask some of the people who have no choice how much they like their health coverage.  My friend would have lost his baby if they had waited the six weeks for an Amnio in New Zealand.  Instead, he brought his wife to the U.S. for an immediate Amnio and found their baby was in severe distress and needed an in-utero transfusion to survive.  In Europe, it's a typical six-to-eight week wait for MRI, CAT scans, Ultrasounds, etc.  That's an eternity when the doctor has told you that you have a "Suspicious mass" in your body.  Sometimes that's the difference between life and death.</comment>

<comment>WOW, and here I thought you lied about your premiums. Now you are inventing other crap. Europe you say, you do know that Europe is a couple dozen countries.Question, I read you have a friend. How much do you pay him to be your friend?</comment>

<comment>Then we can all have health services like the excellent, timely care our veterans receive through the VA! Oh, wait ...</comment>

<comment>The VA that the Republicans routinely gut and block aid for while they pander to their voting blocks with empty "Support the Troops" bumper sticker rhetoric?</comment>

<comment>All the more reason not to put our health care in the hands of the government! Do you want Republicans to use those same tactics to limit the care YOU receive?</comment>

<comment>I can always vote out my Congress critter. I can't vote out my employer's insurance company.</comment>

<comment>"Actually the veto may not matter. The Affordable Care Act is already collapsing under its own weight. "That's a significant argument for a single-payer system.</comment>

<comment>The single largest cost is the last 2 weeks of life.  Single payer, ACA, or the previous mess will not solve that problem.   The nation would have to have an honest conversation over a cut-off per cost for healthcare (QAL in UK terms https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/....  Until that happens, decent savings can be made in other area but the US will still be paying significantly more compared with other first world nations.</comment>

<comment>Those are the "Death Panels" that Palin alluded to.  It was a clumsy characterization, but an accurate statement.</comment>

<comment>DEAAAATH  PANEEEEELS !!!Oh my gawd, is that still around?</comment>

<comment>Yes.  It is clearly in no one's interest to allow the government to institute end of life care limits.  The citizenry should determine how much to dedicate towards  the nation's end of care costs and all citizens must contribute (EG payroll tax).</comment>

<comment>And inflation, you just wait.  It's coming.  Any day now.  watch.  believe me  aaaannyy daaay.....</comment>

<comment>Gotta love seeing people waste more government money and time on this crap.</comment>

<comment>Of course because enriching the healthcare insurance sector is the most important thing in America. I bet they'll invite Obama to sit on all their boards after his term is up.</comment>

<comment>Why not pass an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit or an expansion of the per Child deduction? Let Obama make the complicated case against those middle and working class tax breaks. Fools. They deserve to be Trumped.</comment>

<comment>I am curious to hear why you think the President would veto a clean bill sent to his desk that did both of those things?</comment>

<comment>they tried it beforeObama's not repealing his own bill via blackmail.  Get over it</comment>

<comment>I agree there is no way Obama would sign the repeal bill.  I'm curious why the OP thinks he would veto  a bill expanding the EITC or the per child deduction.  What do you think I need to get over?</comment>

<comment>It reduces government revenue.</comment>

<comment>Bull.  The EITc is $60B give or take.  We could triple it and it would be a proverbial drop in the bucket of the entire budget.  If the GOP controlled Congress sent a bill that did that and nothing else (such as defund Planned Parenthood) to the President he would melt the pen from signing it so fast.  The GOP would never send such a bill because they care fuck-all about the poor.</comment>

<comment>The dirty little secret of Progressivism is that it requires tax increases on everyone, even the poor.</comment>

<comment>That's not a secret. They are pretty open about it. </comment>

<comment>This is so amazingly stupid. ACA is a huge boon to the health insurance industry, a Republican favorite, and it is largely a watered down version of Romney's health care plan in Massachusetts. The Beveridge Model, this is not.I don't think ACA is near the radical jump to justice that Hillary portrays it-it's simply a reform of the already incoherent and expensive system. But it's better than nothing, and I'll give Obama credit for being the first President in a long time to get anything through.</comment>

<comment>If you think ACA had been a boon to insurance companies, you haven't been paying attention to 3Q results.  It's a loss leader.  12 co-ops have already folded and the nation's largest insurer is exiting the market.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Keep up the propaganda.</comment>

<comment>The Insurance companies foolishly thought it would be a boon.  I'm sure some insurance company MBA's thought that the Feds subsiding premiums would create a never-ending supply of revenue; they should have listed to those of us who cautioned that the young would not sign up, and the risk pools would get weighed down with the sick.  United Health is only the 1st to go public with the problems, which will only increase post 2015.  If only we could feel Schadenfreude for the Insurance companies, unfortunately, they, along with Obama and the Democrats screwed too many middle class people to feel good about what's happening.</comment>

<comment>An anecdotal story.In 2008, one of my people's son needed mental help. Our company plan would only pay for three visits to a psychiatrist and three to a mental health therapist. The kid committed suicide a few weeks later after the benefits ran out. Today, Obamacare would see that the son received continuing treatment.Ya, she is middle class. Ya, our premiums were going up every year during the 2000s, often by double digits. Since Obamacare came in, those rates have risen a lot slower.Many wanted single payer. Americans deserve it.</comment>

<comment>Sorry about you friends' loss.Good for you that your premium rates are slowing.But here's data:In Maryland, premiums for exchange plans sold by market-leading CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield will jump by more than 30 percent next year. BlueCross BlueShield exchange plans in Tennessee will feature premium hikes of more than 36 percent. New Mexico's top insurer, Health Care Service Corp., will raise prices by 51.6 percent.Read more at http://www.philly.com/philly/o...</comment>

<comment>While we can't compare what is happening under Obamacare, we can compare it to what happened before Obamacare cam along. Those high rate increases happened yearly, not every few years.http://www.forbes.com/sites/ri...</comment>

<comment>The status quo before the ACA was so broken, and people forget how broken it was during those "good old days". Even if it is eventually repealed, the system that replaces it will have to deal with those same old issues. And they will be more apparent now if we switch back.</comment>

<comment>This what I keep thinking about whenever the Repubs vote to repeal the ACA.  What are they going to replace it with?  Those millions of sick people who finally received health insurance aren't going away.  They're the biggest reason this legislation was passed in the first place.So Valyrian and Tyfereth (or any other conservative reading this), how would you solve this problem?  We didn't get a whole lot of answers back when your party was fighting its passage tooth and nail.  What do you have now?</comment>

<comment>"This what I keep thinking about whenever the Repubs vote to repeal the ACA.  What are they going to replace it with?"Nothing. Remember, this is the party that loudly cheered when Wolf Blitzer rhetorically asked "Should we just let them die?"</comment>

<comment>If it is really the case that the mainstream republicans want the sick and poor to die, I simply want them to admit this up front.  I oppose everything that Donald Trump has suggested, but I have to respect the fact that he is the GOP candidate who is the most up front and honest about his fascist beliefs.  If the GOP really wants to be the party of illness, weaponry, poverty, and death, then I wish they would just come right out and say it.</comment>

<comment>To our friendly neighborhood GOPsters, sick people without insurance are useless mooching loser parasites who deserve to die in the gutter after dragging their families into bankruptcy from medical bills.</comment>

<comment>Almost seems like a good argument for why we should make sure everybody is insured.Why don't the GOP factor in the economic BENEFITS of health care. A sick society is not a productive one.</comment>

<comment>You do know that being insured doesn't make you healthy right?Having Obamacare doesn't make anyone stop smoking, lose weight, or exercise.  The rhetoric around health insurance is so hyperbolic people need to be reminded of this important study:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...The long and short of it is having health insurance didn't change anyone's health.  </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Catastrophic policies protect against bankruptcy.  The examples you cite: sinusitis, sprain,  concussion, stomach aches don't cause bankruptcy and are routine and minor injuries.  My family has a high deductible plan ($6800) and all of the aforementioned would be out of pocket expenses for us.  However, when my wife and I were having children we had a low deductible, high peemium plan.  Because that made the most economic sense.   We are better qualified to make healthcare decisions for our familly's well being than a bureaucrat in DC, just like citizens can figure out which cell phone plan makes the most sense for their family.I too keep waiting for Kasich or Christie to breakout.  Personally I'd love to see either one of those guys get the nomination and a fiorina as VP.  alas the terrifying Trump show keeps rolling on.Edit:  I should add that when I say "out of pocket" I actualy mean out of Health Savings Account.  Also, I socked a little bit more into the HSA because my dental insurance doesn't cover professional teeth whitening.  I gave up coffee and soda a few months back and decided to get my teeth whitened as a reward for giving up caffeine. Because I have control over my HSA I'm able to shop around and and get the most bang for my healthcare buck.  And since I'm paying for the teeth whitening myself I negotiated a lower rate with my dentist.  </comment>

<comment>Great question!It's a complicated issue but this opinion piece distills down biggest issues.http://mobile.philly.com/news/...</comment>

<comment>But you have to love the political theater going on here. It certainly caters to the mindless refrain we keep hearing about the ACA destroying the healthcare industry (as if it isn't worthless to patients already). The ACA only reinforced the industry's grip on health care.</comment>

<comment>"it's simply a reform of the already incoherent and expensive system"It's a massive expansion, not a reform, of an incoherent and expensive system.  There is little reform in Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>How can I applaud a waste of time ?</comment>

<comment>When UHC and other insurers finally pull out, the knucklehead in the WH should be forced to pay for the healthcare of the uninsured.</comment>

<comment>We should release Mitch back into the Galapogus so he can fight for his life without health care.</comment>

<comment>When they make the live-action film of "Yertle the Turtle," Mitch is a shoo-in for the lead.</comment>

<comment>The President should just sign the repeal.  The lack of foresight reflected in the legislation will be exposed and the ensuing chaos will just help move us toward the inevitable nationalization of the industry sooner.The 1950s model of paying for medical care only works if you want to be treated with 1950s medicine.</comment>

<comment>I was thinking the same thing.  Sign the bill into law, and then trumpet from the rooftops that everyone is losing their insurance thanks to the Teahadists.  That should reshape a few Congressional races, not to mention the Presidential race.  Single payer, here we come!</comment>

<comment>Yes, what we really need is some fresh, early 19th century, one size fits all thinking when it comes to health care. It's no accident that health care costs have skyrocketed since the intervention of the government in a big way in health care.</comment>

<comment>"It's no accident that health care costs have skyrocketed since the intervention of the government in a big way in health care."Are you actually trying to assert that health care costs weren't rapidly rising before 2009-10?</comment>

<comment>Actually, I date the problem back to the introduction of Medicare/Medicaid.</comment>

<comment>But, none of it could possibly be attributed to the massive advancements/developments in medical care over that same period?</comment>

<comment>Oh, we would be spending more on health care regardless. But the fact that the government stepped in and essentially took the decision making process out of consumer's hands for a large chunk of the population contributed to a big chunk of it.</comment>

<comment>Pure speculation.  You ignore other factors like increased lifespans, increased population, employer  provided insurance, etc.As to the overarching issue, I'm curious, what replaces government involvement?  An unregulated insurance industry is impossible and letting the poor and elderly suffer is a hard sell.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is suggesting letting the poor and elderly suffer. The plans should be turned over to the states for administration, and let them modify them as they see fit. They will invariably come up with a working model that is both affordable and meets the health care needs of their citizens.</comment>

<comment>So, your solution is to punt?  Maybe cross your fingers too?</comment>

<comment>Letting the states handle health care is far from "punting". It actually makes sense, as you want to keep any system, especially the public portion,  as close to the voters/consumers as possible.</comment>

<comment>You can't think, "Let the states do it!" is a solution without defining what "it" is.</comment>

<comment>There isn't going to be "one solution" for every single state. Nor should there be. The needs of the people of Wyoming are much different than the health care concerns of Florida. Block granting the current programs back to the states would be a good start.</comment>

<comment>Well, the states failed before, that's what led to increased the federal role.  Might as well try it again, right?But, then, there's Kansas. . . .</comment>

<comment>Medicare and Medicaid were not enacted because the states "failed". Pushing for a nationalized health system had been a goal of Democrats for decades.</comment>

<comment>"Pushing for a nationalized health system had been a goal of Democrats for decades."Not just Ds.And, more importantly,the reason why is that everything else has failed - starting with the states trying to address the issues.</comment>

<comment>The states hadn't "failed" at anything, nor were they clamoring for he monstrosity that's the ACA. They were going about it in there own ways, with Texas taking a different approach than Massachusetts. That's the way forward to a model that works. What we do know is that the current public system is broken, and that we need more patient control with regards to the private side.</comment>

<comment>“The needs of the people of Wyoming are much different than the health care concerns of Florida.”In what way?</comment>

<comment>Geography and demographics, for starters.</comment>

<comment>My question was not, how is Wyoming different from Florida? My question was, how are their health-care-related needs or concerns different?</comment>

<comment>And I answered you. Florida's demographics are much different than Wyoming, with more immigrants and more elderly, so there you would have to have more care tailored to those groups. Where you place your hospitals and clinics is also going to be much different in a sparsely populated Wyoming than it is in Florida. This is why the states are going to be better suited to coming up with plans based upon their own citizen's needs.</comment>

<comment>You've suggested why the needs might be different. You have not stated even one way they actually are different. Placement of hospitals is important, but the underlying need or concern—that care be accessible—is identical.</comment>

<comment>You don't understand that an elderly population is going to require different health care priorities? That new immigrants bring with them some unhealthy issues that require a different response? Do you understand that everything from heart disease to cancer have different rates among different demographic groups?</comment>

<comment>I do understand that. However, regardless of whether there are more heart attacks or Alzheimer’s or cancer patients to treat in Florida, human bodies are the same everywhere and people in every place will have those needs; everyone will need to have children immunized, etc.I agree that placement of care facilities requires consideration of demographics, but that is probably even more true within states than when comparing one to another. Basically, I’d argue that health care needs and concerns are similar not only across the US, but across all wealthy countries or even moderately wealthy ones where communicable diseases such as malaria are not big factors. Could not the differences you are talking about be dealt with by having such decisions made at a local level regardless of any insurance scheme?</comment>

<comment>The decisions as to health care needs should be made by the patients and the doctor. The public policy portion of the funding and decision should be made at the most feasible local level possible, which would be the state. That's where the systems should be set up and run.</comment>

<comment>“The decisions as to health care needs should be made by the patients and the doctor.” Generally, I agree, but I see no relevance to the question of whether states or nations should be arranging the payment systems.“The public policy portion of the funding and decision should be made at the most feasible local level possible, which would be the state.” My suggestion was that locality-dependent things like facilities placement could be done on a local level — it would not need to be a state level but could be regional as well — regardless of whether the system was a state-run system or a nationally run system. In fact, living in a region encompassing part of three states (the Philadelphia area), I can see where it might be easier to coordinate activity with a national system because it would not involve having to coordinate the activities of two or more systems.</comment>

<comment>Yes, so many problems caused by trying to help the elderly and the poor!!! If only America could learn to ignore those useless people. The government should help only those who are self-reliant.</comment>

<comment>That's not what I said.</comment>

<comment>And yet, here in Merry Old England, our NHS costs under half of the American model. All the while providing free-at-point-of-service healthcare to all.The problem's not in the idea, it's in the implementation.</comment>

<comment>The Canadian healthcare system costs much less as well.</comment>

<comment>It's also a horrible system compared to ours, with worse outcomes. I'll gladly pay more for a better system.</comment>

<comment>"It's also a horrible system compared to ours, with worse outcomes"Based on what?</comment>

<comment>Outcomes from major diseases  (cancer, heart disease, etc), wait times, availability of new drugs, etc.</comment>

<comment>Cite?</comment>

<comment>The study's conclusio:"The question that we have posed is much simpler: does a poor performance by the US health care system account for the low international ranking of longevity in the US? Our answer is, 'no'."In other words, "Eh, we're not so bad."</comment>

<comment>Or, at least we shouldn't aspire to have health care systems that are worse than ours.</comment>

<comment>Generally run of the mill health care/costs are far better under the UK system.  It is when you deal with rare illnesses or treatments that requires specialized doctors or equipment that the wait time becomes an issue.Provides the statistics on wait times.https://www.england.nhs.uk/sta...Describes the general wait time process.http://www.nhs.uk/choiceintheN...Describes the process of cancer.http://www.cancerresearchuk.or...One for Canada.http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/...</comment>

<comment>You mean as ISIS and Islamist terror reigns throughout the western world and Obama spends time talking about "climate change" and guns as a fix? Get a grip hack. </comment>

<comment>Hi Jack! IF Obama had a chance to do something that would be both useful and achievable about terror yesterday, then by all means, he should have done that.. My point was that the Republicans knew this legislation wasn't going anywhere, it was pure show. You have a nice day now.</comment>

<comment>Well I could make the same point about gun control where the Dems talk talk talk but never do anything because they know it will never get a enough votes to pass or get enough support from their own caucus. The Dems learned in the 90's that gun control is a loser and run like hell when it comes down to brass tacks. Cali has the strongest gun laws in the nation already and it won't prevent bad people from acts of violence with or without guns. If the Dems were serious they would propose a gun ban outright which would be unconstitutional. Then they could push for a repeal of second amend. Never happen nor will gun control. </comment>

<comment>Awesome, now we're getting somewhere. How about the Democrats, the Republicans -- I don't care who suggests it-- simply roll back to 2004 and reinstate the assault weapon ban. Not unconstitutional, we already had the law. Completely doable. Americans would cheer. How 'bout it? I'll suggest it to my Republican congressman (who has already said he doesn't support it) how 'bout you?</comment>

<comment>That would be fine, I guess.  Unfortunately, it wouldn't stop most of the gun deaths (mass shootings or regular crime) since most of them are caused by shooters with handguns.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. But I'm all for not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. Doing this, as opposed to nothing, seems right to me.</comment>

<comment>It sets an incredibly dangerous precedent to allow the government to limit individual rights with legislation that does next to nothing.  In those cases (as exampled by the assault weapons ban & significantly low deaths by assault weapons) it is better to do nothing.  Many of the arguments & tactics used to restrict second amendment rights are currently being used to restrict first amendment rights (safe spaces, offensive speech is not protected speech, pre-censoring in the name of keeping the peace, etc.).</comment>

<comment>After one of his officers is ambushed by a teenager wielding a semiautomatic AR-15 and fired at 26 times, Oklahoma City Police Chief Bill Citty tells  The Oklahoman, “There are just more and more assault rifles out there, and it is becoming a bigger threat to law enforcement each day. They are outgunned.”   Citty states that he sees “no practical reason” why a civilian would need an AR-15 or similiar military-style weapon." (Jan. 16, 2011)For plenty more from police chiefs and law enforcement professionals: http://csgv.org/resources/2013...</comment>

<comment>"But in the 10 years since the previous ban lapsed, even gun control advocates acknowledge a larger truth:  The law that barred the sale of assault weapons from 1994 to 2004 made little difference.It turns out that big, scary military rifles don't kill the vast majority of the 11,000 Americans murdered with guns each year.  Little handguns do." (9-14-2014)http://www.nytimes.com/2014/09...</comment>

<comment>Al Qaeda encouraged extremists in the US to take advantage of our lack of gun laws so not exactly unrelated. </comment>

<comment>Stretch as Cali has the strongest gun laws already and would not have prevented this attack. The Boston boys used pressure cooker bombs so should we outlaw pressure cookers too? </comment>

<comment>They allow guns so they do not have adequate gun laws. Bombs are illegal.</comment>

<comment>Gun laws don't work. That's proven in Cali and Chicago. There are 300 million firearms in this country alone and the horse has left the barn 75 plus years ago. The Dems still remember the shellacking they took in the 90s over gun control and nothing will happen. I'm a realist. Repeal the second amendment and you still would have 100 million guns out there. </comment>

<comment>So we shouldn't have any laws, no laws against drunk driving, no laws against murder, etc.  Since criminals don't follow laws lets repeal them all.</comment>

<comment>No but we shouldn't even be talking about gun laws right now. This is a terror attack and we have a whole world of hurt coming our way if we don't get on this terror threat. Gun laws solve nothing! </comment>

<comment>Once again the republicans are solving imaginary problems while ignoring the real ones. If they got their way and repealed the ACA, it would hurt many Americans unnecessarily. Meanwhile they are ignoring the epidemic of gun violence that has led to more than one mass shooting a day here in the homeland. The modern day republican party has chosen to pander to ignorant and hateful extremists rather than standing up for decent values. And sadly for them, the pool of voters they are pandering to is shrinking rapidly.</comment>

<comment>ACA is doomed in its present form regardless of who is President after 2016 as the co ops are failing, United Healthcare the largest Insurerer is bailing, choice disappears and premiums skyrocket 50% in the next 2 years with massive under enrollment by those targeted by ACA. Gun violence and mass shootings if you take out black on black violence is no worse here than in Europe. Gun laws would have done nothing to change this incident this week nor the Boston Bombing 2 years ago. Islamic terror which Obama refuses to acknowledge is the bigger problem. Wake up. </comment>

<comment>Going broke paying for medical care, which happens to many of your fellow citizens, with or without Obamacare, is a bigger problem than "Islamic terror."</comment>

<comment>The middle class is going to go broke with Obamacare...</comment>

<comment>Reagan (the guy who ran from Lebanon when he realized it was a sectarian CF) and Goldwater (who warned about the corroding effects that religious fundamentalism would have on political discourse) would have to be Democrats today. This is not a good thing. A country needs multiple viable parties.</comment>

<comment>To think this incompetent bunch of time wasting people actually get paid for doing absolutely nothing of any consequence except to concentrate on trying to repeal Obamacare for what must be close to the 100th time!! This America is what passes for smart government! Only it's not it's an embarrassment. Republicans only care about trying to destroy Obama's historical health care reform bill and couldn't care less that it could hurt others along the way. The party of no sense is also the party of no shame.</comment>

<comment>Obamacare is failing and will either implode on its own or be massively overhauled by 2018 regardless. Do some research. </comment>

<comment>Then we'll have to raise taxes to fund it. But making 18M people uninsured again is insanely immoral.</comment>

<comment>The poor and young who were the target are not signing up and the ACA goal is at half it projected at 10 million. The issue is also they sign up get treatment or care and then drop out and use ER if needed. It's broken sorry. </comment>

<comment>18M newly insured people is a win. Uninsured percentage at the hospital at which I work down to 4% from 35% is a win. It is insuring people. If it needs more money, raise taxes. If private insurance won't work, change to Medicare for all.</comment>

<comment>Do you understand that fewer than 10M people eligible enrolled and more than 10M eligible didn't enroll?  Numbers matter.  </comment>

<comment>Which number is greater: people with insurance today or people with insurance before the ACA? Here are two more numbers, though anecdotal from the hospital at which I work: % of pts with no insurance prior to the ACA: 35; % of pts with no insurance today: 4.</comment>

<comment>yes the poor tortured 18 million who for the first time in a long time have coverage.   The poor tortured self employed who no longer are forced to seek insurance as an individual.   the poor torture American senior whose donut hole for prescriptions has disappeared.   The sad thing is this law affects only 20 percent of the people who don't get their insurance from their employer.   The sad thing is people are complaining that in some cases they are having to pay more without 1, acknowledging their contribution went up year after year and cynical employers pass more cost on to employees and tell them oh, it's because of Obamacare.   And let's finally not forget those tortured Americans with preexisting conditions who couldn't get health care worth spit.  Yeah, let's throw them back to the mercy of the insurance companies -- who in my opinion are soulless greedy monsters.   Republicans rely on the ignorance of the average voter not knowing what a success this has been -- aided and abetted by the fat, lazy media who don't inform the public of this fact -- and sadly there's a lot of THAT voter about.</comment>

<comment>In other words, Republicans in Congress continue to waste America's time and money.   They haven't voted on war with ISIS or done jack squat to deal with any other pressing issues, but they sure made time for pointless posturing on the ACA and punishing women who seek medical care.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, rotsa ruck with that!!!</comment>

<comment>Translation: Republicans continue to further their hidden agenda to pave the road for the Hillary Clinton Presidency.</comment>

<comment>The Millennials who were a big part of the coalition that elected Obama to the White House twice are hypocritically not buying into Obamacare in sufficient numbers and the Obamacare exchanges are falling into an adverse selection death spiral.</comment>

<comment>The Republican voters who have been wrong about everything for fifty years and voted for people who transparently and intentionally lie to them every two years remain so completely insulated from reality that they say things like "Obamacare is falling into a death spiral" over five years after the bill was passed and in spite of every fact-based source finding the system to be performing better than projected.</comment>

<comment>"the bill does not scrap the health law’s provisions allowing parents to keep their children covered under their insurance plans through age 26, or the prohibition on insurers discriminating against people with preexisting conditions, among others. But it does gut the law by eliminating the insurance exchanges and subsidies, and by repealing the Medicaid expansion accepted by 30 states."The article doesn't state, but I'm assuming that the Republican bill would also eliminate the coverage mandate.  If so, then this bill would be the death knell for the private insurance industry.  If there is no mandate, no subsidies and no exchanges, but insurance companies are still required to accept all applicants regardless of their current health or pre-existing conditions, then the private insurance industry will soon be dead, dead, dead.</comment>

<comment>**the private insurance industry will soon be dead, dead, dead.**You type that like it was a bad thing. The health "insurance" firms are parasitical vultures that should be outlawed. The sooner they die, the sooner we get to have a saner health care system.</comment>

<comment>Not typing it like it is a good thing or a bad thing.  It just is.  I will say that I don't think killing the private insurance industry is the intent of the Republicans who drafted the bill.  Them putting this partial repeal bill forward without a plan for "replace" just reinforces in my mind how short-sighted the Republicans in Congress are.At the very least can we agree that, regardless of what we would end up with on the other end, having the private insurance industry die in an adverse selection death spiral would be a very painful transition for a lot of people (i.e. millions of people lose access to health care because they lose coverage and can't buy it elsewhere, millions of people working in the insurance industry lose their jobs)?</comment>

<comment>Which is why the only reason they actually passed this is because of the certainty of veto.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.Today's Republicans only think tactically, not strategically.  They are never looking any further than trying to win the current legislative battle or the next election.  So frequently, their short-term tactics undermine their stated long-term goals.Most of the time I can't decide if they really are that short-sighted or if they just don't really believe in their stated goals/principles.  (I also realize those two things are not mutually exclusive.)</comment>

<comment>Yes, they want to keep all the provisions that their supporters like and kill all the ones they don't ignoring the fact that they go together or it doesn't work.  They no Obama isn't going to sign it so it is just an exercise in grandstanding.</comment>

<comment>Once again the party of symbolic law creation has finally gained a respectable spot in Disneyworld.  The real significance is that future efforts from the party dedicated to taking us back, restoring our greatness will be.  No alternative in sight-- unless you consider what existed before the ACA to be an alternative. Personally, I'm so missing the days of denied coverage for pre-existing conditions, refused treatment and medical bankruptcies.  Who are these lower income sick people who believe they have a chance at avoiding the 1% death panels? What arrogance!</comment>

<comment>This is Political Kabuki. Each side rallying their base. Mainstream Republicans get a shot at their own primaries, or so they think, and Democrats get the perfect polarising issue to turn their base into a tidal wave, come next November. Washington Republicans are a two-issue party, "Obamacare" and "Benghazi". Neither for any substantive reasons, just for show.</comment>

<comment>A bill need 67 votes to override a veto, not 60 as mentioned in this article.  To overcome a filibuster a bill needs 60 yays to come to the floor for vote (not a yay in favor of the bill, a yay to allow the bill to come to a vote)</comment>

<comment>What is achieved by this war on healthcare?   What is the alternative?  Surely their supporters and constituents want something in it's place.</comment>

<comment>No.  Their constituents and supporters are just angry, but most don't even know what they are angry about or who is responsible.   A huge portion of them probably think the ACA still has "death panels".The another big proportion are probably still complaining about government getting its hands on their Medicaid/Medicare coverage.Another large group wants to repeal it because they think their taxes are too high, not realizing they actually are in the 47% of folks paying no income tax that Romney was complaining about, and that pretty much every single GOP tax plan calls for them to pay proportionally MORE (if not outright more, though most GOP tax plans explode deficits instead) taxes to pay for rate cuts for upper earners.A very small proportion actually have rational complaints, and simply dislike that as mid-size or larger employers and the higher income earners in the US, they actually have to pay for the health and well being of their employees.  Of course, this is the group that actually funds the pols, so they get what they want.</comment>

<comment>We want whatever exists without government intervention in it's place, because whatever that is is better than whatever the government will do.  These are people who can't even manage to keep our national highway system properly funded and bridges from collapsing and you think they have any valuable contribution to healthcare besides politically motivated garbage?</comment>

<comment>Like who?Do you want the insurance companies to be in charge?</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter so long as people are free to choose,  I'm personally a member of a non-profit healthcare expense sharing collective.  Earlier this year one month's "premium" was actually 5% lower than it should have been because expenses we lower than projected, so they returned the savings.Remember, only the government compels you to deal with it, absent it all interactions are voluntary.</comment>

<comment>Let's repeal Obama Care.And replace with Medicare.</comment>

<comment>Does it means these jokers can get back to work now?  Oh, yeah, probably not.</comment>

<comment>Why would you want them working?  That's where law like the Patriot Act and the ACA come from in the first place.  I'd happily give 50 Senators a billion each from the public treasury to never show up to work.  The savings would be enormous.</comment>

<comment>..It is time to throw every Tea Party Congressional member OUT OF OFFICE... remember this waste of time legislation in November 2016..</comment>

<comment>At times I think I am reading about Senators in some third world country. Then I realize these are American senators! Why do they work so hard to bring confusion.</comment>

<comment>"Senators in some third world country"Nah.  Those guys aren't afraid of science.</comment>

<comment>Here we go again - after settled case law upholding the ACA, here, once again, is that turkey neck McConnell with his shit eaten grin, going after President Obama, ifnothing else to say, “I told you we would get him”.  Get him in the sense that McConnell has showed his constituents how much he disagrees with President Obama’s policies.In time, when the ACA proves to be a huge benefit for Americans across thecountry, McConnell and other republican palookas will say it was their effortsand not President Obama’s that made the law work for the people.Go back to Kentucky and drinks some damn bourbon you obstructionist little s***.</comment>

<comment>Case law isn't relevant to the folks granted the power to repeal law.  They brought the ACA into the World and they can take it out of the World if they choose to do so, provided they have enough votes.</comment>

<comment>Yawn...</comment>

<comment>Where is job creation mentioned in the powers delegated to Congress?</comment>

<comment>How about a vote on immigration reform to keep terrorist out of the US?</comment>

<comment>That'll happen just as soon as they ban assault rifles and mega bullet clip ammunition</comment>

<comment>So never. USA is weak.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they should spend some time debating a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force. The one we are using now is 14 years old. I believe we have resolved the wmd, regime change, and nation building question that it was intended to address.</comment>

<comment>Nah, it's easier to blame Obama for whatever he does if they have no vote on record.</comment>

<comment>Senator Yertle has the floor.</comment>

<comment>And the next time you decide to take a photo, Mitch - have someone pluck your nose hair before the shoot.</comment>

<comment>One has to wonder how many tax dollars go into every one of these pathetic stunts.</comment>

<comment>A lot less than the tax dollars that get wasted treating the uninsured in the ER.</comment>

<comment>...so, let's toss out the ACA, without any alternative, and flood those ERs with uninsured. Yep, that's a Republican solution all right.</comment>

<comment>Akin to their "solution" to AGW, when they grudgingly admit that it's happening: Build seawalls! (at taxpayer's expense), to protect the wealthy individuals and grotesquely rich corporate hotel chains that live on and/or are located on the beaches.</comment>

<comment>ERs are more crowded than ever with the ACA insured who cannot afford a doctor or their copays.</comment>

<comment>Way less than go into taxpayer funded healthcare or taxpayer funded bomb dropping.</comment>

<comment>When this was passed I thought it was an interesting idea that brought the insurance companies on board to reform (or expansion) where they had been the biggest obstacle to reform previously.But it doesn't appear to be working like the president said it would. I have no idea what we would replace it with. The old system want all that good and single payer is never going to happen in this country. We can't afford it. Hospitals, drug companies, and doctors will just jack up the prices further when they know the governement cash cow is coming. Seriously, I went to the hospital and received an itemized bill. One acedaminophen tablet cost $300. That's right, $300. Imagine how much that would cost if they could ask for more. </comment>

<comment>The prices are actually more reasonable in other countries...we can control how much we pay them. Right now, the insurance companies are the ones that do the bargaining with the hospitals.</comment>

<comment>The only thing that can lower prices would be to have a truly free market health care system, with price transparency and accountability to the patient as the paying customer. An entire bottle of Excedrin (acetaminophen) cost me about $3 at the drugstore yesterday. At the price you encountered, it would be $7,200.The insanity of an insurance-based health care model is easy to see if you imagine it applied to other industries. How much would a car, or an oil change, cost if you used your auto insurance to pay for the car in the first place, and to pay for every service appointment? We don't do it that way because it would be insane. Instead people pay for their own damn cars and use insurance for what insurance is for — protection from the financial harm of a devastating accident.Where it gets messed up is the laudable idea that ability to pay should have nothing to do with the quality of healthcare one can receive. It's not fair, we believe, if the rich live longer than the poor because they can afford the heart transplant, or the chemo. Fine. That's a lovely egalitarian sentiment. So, if we have billions to spend keeping insurance companies fully staffed, then we have billions to spend generously helping those — and only those — who truly need financial help. Paradoxically, It's the expectation that we shouldn't be billed for so much as tongue depressor or a band-aid that is the cause of outrageous prices.Didn't mean to go on so long, my thanks to anyone who read this far.</comment>

<comment>Guess what.  They billed like that before the ACA.  And if that's what was actually billed to the insurance company, the insurance company agreed to pay that price ahead of time.</comment>

<comment>The reason they charge so much for everything is because of the millions of uninsured that show up in emergency rooms that they have to treat by law.(Don't get me wrong, it's actually a good law, a compassionate law. But people do sometimes take undue advantage of it.) We're not Mexico, not yet anyway. And we as a society won't sit by when someone needs urgent care and say: "Tough turkey."</comment>

<comment>Out of curiosity...do you have a source on it being "the reason"?The impression I've generally got is that it's a small portion of the hospitals costs and not really enough to account for a giant markup like that.I've tended to figure that it's mostly due to insurance companies refusing to pay more than a fraction of what they are charged...so the hospital charges more to make sure they can cover their costs.</comment>

<comment>Yes, correction. Going by much of what I've read on this whole complex issue, it's ONE of the main reasons the costs skyrocket.In effect, the insured are still paying for the care of the uninsured. We may as well socialize it, where everybody pays commensurate with their income.Everybody pays, everybody's cared for. It's really the only solution, and I believe it's inevitable (US socialized medicine and healthcare).Knowing ourselves as a people though, we'll probably end up with a type of capitalist/socialist hybrid system.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough...I was just interested to see if there was some form of research that you had showing that there was a bigger cost to that law that I wasn't aware of.I wholeheartedly agree that a form of socialized healthcare is inevitable, didn't mean to disagree with you on that bit.</comment>

<comment>Funny, aren't they technically utilizing the nuclear option here? Weren't the Democrats called Nazis and dictators for wanting to use the 51 vote threshold and Harry Reid was demonized for it? If anything, this just shows Democrats suck at controlling the message and are always on the defensive</comment>

<comment>Obamacare is such a success.  This year I had private dental insurance for $48 a month.  Next year I can get the same dental insurance through Obamacare for $57 a month.  What an improvement.</comment>

<comment>Do the words, "post hoc" mean anything to you?</comment>

<comment>There is no stand alone dental insurance under ObamaCare.</comment>

<comment>A few years ago, I was paying several hundred dollars a month for out of pocket medicines for my husband.Now I'm paying for insurance that will now cover us even though he's a diabetic.What an improvement.</comment>

<comment>"Someone lives, someone dies..."  K. Sebelius.  When they decide it's your turn, will it still be an improvement?</comment>

<comment>Cute hyperbole. </comment>

<comment>Not even.  KS actually said it referring to a transplant a girl needed and was determined necessary by a doctor.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>It's hyperbole in the context and you know it.You're being ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>You are being obtuse.  KS was trying to justify refusing appoval for life saving surgery to that specific person.</comment>

<comment>It's not on the same level as insisting that financial concerns might be a reason to let a person die, especially not worse than it used to be.There is a limited number of organs that can be given to people.</comment>

<comment>Somebody lives and somebody dies.  A bureaucrat gets to decide.  I wonder how you might feel if it gets applied to you?I've noticed empathy/sympathy seems to lose traction when someone is trying to support their political party hacks.</comment>

<comment>So..who should make the decision?The patients? The doctors that are already attached to the patients? Doctors will always advocate for their own patients, so..a third party comes into play, which necessitates some level of bureaucracy.My father died waiting for an organ transplant, other people were given higher priority over him, but I'm mature enough to realize that it's not the fault of the people who denied them. Grow up.It's also not even close to being on the same level...we don't have enough organs to go around.</comment>

<comment>There were no others needing the transplant.  The operation was a success.  The child now has a full life of opportunities.When your spouses medcation gets too expensive, and they turn just a little too old, do you think you'll hear someone lives....?</comment>

<comment>There are no age restrictions on medications...he was putting his life at risk when we had to skip on his medication because of the cost though.You know who decided that we couldn't get insurance because of his condition?</comment>

<comment>"Get" insurance.  What happens when you already have it?I'm actually ok with the government setting up its own plan. Im against forcing everyone to support it.  If they came up with a superior program, people would be lining up to join.  I'm also against administrators determining what's economically feasible.</comment>

<comment>Get insurance... You know, like when the insurance company agrees to cover you.His health likely got damaged as a result.Who do you think made that decision? Some kind of government official?</comment>

<comment>You may be misunderstanding.  Your spouse had  pre existing condition.  Before that, you didn't have insurance for whatever reason.  No one would take that burden up.What if you already have insurance and then the company says they won't cover your issues because of cost?  That's what KS did and why Your example isn't comparable.I have no problem with the government doing something like expanding Medicaid for uninsurables.  Forcing everyone to participate,is the problem.  </comment>

<comment>I'm not misunderstanding at all.You complain about bureaucracy, but have no issue with situations where bureaucrats are deciding whether or not a person is able to get care.You also complain about the compromise that was necessary to ensure that a person doesn't get put in the situation that my husband was...by bureaucrats.Don't think for a second that they don't keep people from getting the appropriate treatment because of cost, either. What exactly do you think lifetime limits did?"Sorry, your cancer cost too much...we're not going to cover any more."</comment>

<comment>You do misunderstand.  I don't have a problem when a company decides whether or not to issue insurance to someone with a pre existing condition.  Or to anyone in general.  It's cost/risk.Someone who is covered by insurance, should be covered. Do you understand the difference?  I've said it twice before.You weren't insured for some reason. That was unfortunate.  However, a person who is currently covered, should be covered.  It's not right for a bureaucrat to make a dollar cost decision.</comment>

<comment>Why are you struggling to admit it?"I am okay with someone dying it if saves me money or makes me feel better"</comment>

<comment>You complain about people dying due to beaucracy, but you're okay with it if it's in a way that suits you.I get it. You're a hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>What "bureaucracy" is he talking about?This is just insurance from an insurance company.The "gubmint" never was involved, except to make sure the insurance policy had basic minimums.</comment>

<comment>No, you are being a dink.I can't say it any clearer.  If you are a customer, then you should be covered for everything in your policy. Period.If you as applying for insurance as a new customer, then it's up to that company to decide if they want to be your insurance agent.Jesus I'm feel like I don't understand English anymore after talking with you.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I understand what youre saying.. I have for quite a while now.I'm saying you have some hilarious double standards.</comment>

<comment>Covered vs uncovered.You made the poor choice to not have insurance before your spouse got the sugar rots.Or you didn't want to pay a higher price for insurance if it was a life long ailment.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I'm just going to ignore those desperate insults.I understand what youre saying.I'm saying you have a double standard.</comment>

<comment>You pay $48 a month for dental? You're getting ripped off.</comment>

<comment>I think that was his message.</comment>

<comment>I almost think Obama should call a press conference and tell the country that if the House will just pass the Senate bill as is, he will sign it as soon as the Republican leadership stands up in public and accepts responsibility for the consequences to the American health care system - that the people who lose coverage and access to Medicaid, or whose loved ones die for lack of coverage, and the health insurance payers and providers who go bankrupt as a result - all are the Republican party's responsibility.   The screaming from the insurance industry and major medical providers alone would bring the Republican party to its knees - and maybe even to its senses.</comment>

<comment>The GOP would love that.  They would fast track a bill going back to pre-ACA while keeping a few of the popular provisions in a heartbeat.</comment>

<comment>Cannot keep the popular provisions without the mitigating ones without causing complete collapse of the health insurance system.</comment>

<comment>Sure you can.  There are all sorts of things you can do legislatively.  You can force insurance plans to accept anyone with continuous coverage.  You can force insurance plans to cover people on their parents plan till they are 30.  You can actually do those things without a law forcing them to do so if you simply put conditions on the plans that they cannot be listed on the exchanges without these features.</comment>

<comment>No, that doesn't work.  You can't force plans to accept continuous coverage and long-children time periods, unless there are other measures in place which lower the costs/increase the profits of the insurers...  e.g., required coverage to expand the pools and the government Medicaid/subsidies to the low income folks to bring them into the system.  The mandate is critical to allowing the increased coverage.If you require adding the benefits without the tradeoff/pay-for provisions, health insurance inflation goes through the roof, as more healthy folks can't afford insurance and drop out of the risk pools (further exacerbating the cost/benefit problem), and the system goes into a death spiral.Pre-ACA there was nothing that prevented insurers from offering such plans before.  But those plans were more expensive so the only folks that bought them were sicker folks... which made them more expensive(see death spiral problem), .Plus, there is nothing that says insurers can't currently offer "non-compliant" plans "off the exchange" as you advocate.  The purchaser may still have to pay the tax/fine as the insurance doesn't "count", but nothing prevents folks from offering such plans.</comment>

<comment>Of course you can pass a law or regulations. That doesn't mean you can make it work. Just like you can eat all the sweets you want, but you'll get fat.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>The costs of those provisions would be passed on to consumers.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You think they aren't being passed on to consumers under the ACA?</comment>

<comment>Except that the popular provisions they wouldn't dare roll back, like the end to medical underwriting, if kept without the mandate and subsidies would break the insurance industry, and bring down the wrath of business on the GOP's head.I actually know it's not a feasible approach, but it really is time theses goons own up to the consequences of the crap they are peddling.</comment>

<comment>I'm happy to see that the Clowns in the Senate finally are on the same page with the Clowns in the House of Representatives!</comment>

<comment>This is the first time I've seen that old buzzard Mitch smile in about 10 years!</comment>

<comment>What's really weird is that the vast majority of Kentuckians support ACA, and yet they keep electing Mitch McTurtle. An often strange republic we inhabit!</comment>

<comment>Most people don't vote.</comment>

<comment>I doubt I'll be voting this time around...ugh...there's just not enough nose holding.Crazy Donald Trump or Rape Enabler Hillary...</comment>

<comment>I'm voting for Bernie Sanders. He seems to be the one most concerned for people like me, working class. He plans on taxing the Wall Street crooks appropriately. I'm moderate independent, fiscally conservative, socially progressive. Wall Street's tax aversion and subsequent bailout is  one of a couple reasons why the US is in such an economic predicament. An unhinged Congress is why our bridges are falling down, levee's break and a slew of other things that could be putting the working class to work, here in America. I find myself nodding my head when I listen to his speeches. That tends to be the candidate I vote for.</comment>

<comment>Congress doesn't manage the roads, bridges, and levees.  The states do.  Check the budgets to see how much has been allocated to,state projects and then you can figure out who is at fault there.But bh0 continues on with many of the same policies bush started and I really can't see much difference between the two parties anymore.</comment>

<comment>They disguised it by calling it Kentucky something so people could still hate Obama and like their health insurance.</comment>

<comment>So Republican senators vote to piss off half the nation that is female (a/k/a swing voters) and deny low income young women health clinic cancer screening services, birth control and constitutionally protected abortions, while again voting to allow terrorists on a watch list to obtain guns without any background check. Oh-kay.</comment>

<comment>And in a presidential election year, those single moms, as well as many other sections of the electorate, are more likely to turn out to vote, not just for prez, but for House and Senate as well.</comment>

<comment>Oh, is this still a thing?</comment>

<comment>What is this fascination with Healthcare or Obamacare that has been around since last 5 years? Is there a simple chart anywhere pointing out what the pros and cons are for having one versus NOT? If I work for a company, then they offer me with multiple options - some work better for singles and others work better for married. Not every single plan caters to all. Is that the issue? Someone please post a simple link - no propaganda, but simply a link that points out each benefits and let people decide.Heck, car sites let you compare cars and we can't get a comparison chart on this, but rather this obsession of Bush/Clinton/Obama/..etc name calling. None of this has helped with student loans that every kid racks up or credit card APR scams or outsourcing that companies keep doing (which needs to be taxed) and the list goes on. What a waste of time. I could have been spending this time at a potluck and gotten more deal out of it lol.</comment>

<comment>Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the Senate floor before the final vote:“Today, a middle class that’s suffered enough from a partisan law will see the Senate vote to build a bridge past Obamacare and toward better care."Oh how quaint. The middle class has suffered and is all but disappearing due to "trickle-down" supply-side Reaganomics that the vast majority of Republicans have championed now for over THIRTY YEARS!And what ideas do the Repubs have for "better care"? I see no positive ideas coming from any of them on just about any problem facing the country. Only negatives from the Party of No.</comment>

<comment>So much energy wasted talking about this while they could have been doing something more productive. But, nope, instead of creative ideas to resolve other issues, this is what time is spent on.</comment>

<comment>Maybe a good 'ole fashioned tax break for the millionaire wall street boys is in order? What do you think?</comment>

<comment>Why not? After all, that's a part of Reaganomics. Tax waiters and lawnboys more, and give a break to the "job creators" who stash their money in the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, and outsource jobs overseas.</comment>

<comment>Listening to these indefatigable morons that have done nothing to fix health care for decades crow about gutting an attempt to fix health care should be all you really need to know about the venal psychopaths of the US right. It's a triumph of vile yet ultimately empty rhetoric of hate and pettiness masquerading as policy.</comment>

<comment>What action has the Federal government ever taken that leads you to believe it can "fix healthcare"?  You've seen how they run a healthcare system for the veterans and you want that same government meddling with your care?  They can't even keep bridges in the Federal highway system from collapsing and that requires a fraction of the money healthcare does.</comment>

<comment>So...how do you think we should fix it? Give control to the hospitals or insurance companies?</comment>

<comment>By letting the people who need medical care decide what they want. Things turn out bad when the consumers of a service aren't the ones paying for it. It eliminates incentive to shop around, to avoid problems in the first place, and represents increased cost with every additional middle man you add.</comment>

<comment>So.. Let the hospitals set the price and assume, for some reason, that the free market will work on medicine? </comment>

<comment>Sure, it works pretty well elsewhere in the economy.  School loans, healthcare, and mortgages are the three biggest areas of direct government financial intervention in what would otherwise be private transaction that I can think of and I can't help but notice those three sectors seem to have common problems that I don't see too many other places in the economy.</comment>

<comment>You are aware that free market forces don't work properly in Healthcare? People don't have the choice to refuse to buy something and they often can't shop around.</comment>

<comment>Sure they do.  The free market had insurance back in 1850.</comment>

<comment>How do you think people would price shop for Healthcare in an emergency? How do you think the market would work when a person can't turn down a service without dying?</comment>

<comment>First, most healthcare isn't any emergency.  It's people with fevers or ear aches or sore throats.  There are way more walk in clinics and doctors offices than hospitals.  Second, if consumers were more directly involved in paying for the services the prices of those services would be a lot more transparent.  Right now when the vast majority of people have insurance they don't really care how much it costs, they only care that it is in their insurance network and covered.    Third, if consumers paid more directly the costs would be lower.  Have you ever called to price a windshield repair?  One of the first questions they ask is if you or the insurance are paying.  You get a lower price.</comment>

<comment>I'd do it the same way I would if I had to buy an item at the grocery store in a hurry without the ability to price shop.  I'd go to Aldi because they generally have the lowest prices on everything.  I'd expect if I were routinely paying for health care I'd know who had good prices and who didn't.That market would work the same way any market for life essential goods and services work.  I'll starve to death without food, but that still creates a market with price competition for my business.</comment>

<comment>Are you SERIOUSLY comparing paying extra for food sometimes to having to pay thousands of dollars for health care that you can't refuse to get?Do you even know how economics works?</comment>

<comment>No, I'm drawing a comparison to how I would shop for a service I need urgently based on previous knowledge I have about various providers.  For example if I break my arm I'm going to the walk-in urgent care center, not to the hospital emergency room.  I don't know specifically what either charges, but based on past knowledge the ER will be a minimum of $1000 just to see you, whereas and the urgent care center starts at just $150.</comment>

<comment>Sure..an arm break doesn't tend to be life threatening.Heart attacks though?</comment>

<comment>They've made 54 infantile attempts since its inception to repeal it and failed...They've childishly hidden defunding attempts in unrelated bills hoping the president wouldn't notice...They've even whined to the Supreme Court and got rebuffed and turned away......but like a spoiled little brat that won't take no for an answer they keep trying repeatedly to shut down ObamaCare and Medicare while throwing cash at their financial supporters in the NRA and "defense industry"...pathetic and a waste of the taxpayer's time and money because they think political grandstanding a bill they know won't pass is more important than the People's business</comment>

<comment>That's just it, how I access healthcare is MY business, not the business of the government or any of the rest of you.  If you're concerned about freeloaders who don't get insurance then eliminate the Federal law passed under Reagan requiring hospitals to treat people who can't pay.</comment>

<comment>Ahh yes, the "let them die" position.Your argument is coherent, I'll give you that.  Its not terribly moral or something that a majority of Americans would agree with, but at least you're intellectually consistent.  Props!</comment>

<comment>Honestly I think my position is the only moral one and I summarize it as the "their life, their choice" position.  Anything else reeks of paternalism or authoritarianism by pretending to know what is best for others.Just like I don't care who or what they have sex with so long as it's consenting I don't care what they do for medical care.  Go surgical, pharmacological, spiritual, herbal.  See an M.D. or a Shaman or a heroin dealer, whatever you want, it's not my life, my choice, or my responsibility.</comment>

<comment>That boils down to "let them die" when they aren't able to pay for their care.But..hey, it doesn't matter to you because it's not "your responsibility", right?</comment>

<comment>There is no responsibility without free choice, so unless you want me involved in the choices you make you can't expect to hold me responsible for them.</comment>

<comment>Sure sure, whatever you say.What you're saying IS effectively coming down to "they should die if they can't pay" though.</comment>

<comment>That is a possible outcome, but it's important to stress I'm not saying they should do anything but make their own choices and be responsible for the outcome.</comment>

<comment>Yup yup, responsibility, bootstraps, etc etc. Whatever.You're willing to let people die if it means that you don't have to consider yourself "responsible" for them by having your costs go up.Fine, if you're that selfish of a person..no one cares.You should really own up to it though.</comment>

<comment>I don't think John realizes that insurance is a group responsibility. Or that we started regulating insurance after so many fraudulent policies were sold. And we started regulating medical care after so many people died from scams and frauds or the pure stupidity by untrained practitioners.</comment>

<comment>Hey, don't you think we should make people take responsibility for picking out an appropriate doctor rather than letting the government dictate who gets to practice medicine?</comment>

<comment>As a society, we have done both. There are problems with both, however, but that is still totally better than the free market / absolutely unregulated system so many RWNJs advocate.</comment>

<comment>For the record, that was sarcasm on my part. :)Sorry, it was a bit snide and unnecessary, and in reference to Johns comment.</comment>

<comment>No problem. I had surgery a few days ago and am "on drugs". I am most likely more addled than I think.</comment>

<comment>It's also a fantasy that it has nothing to do with anyone elsea person dies of easily treated illness or injuries it take away from society the entirety of that persons' productivity.Giving someone a $100,000 pill might seem silly but even your average worker will produce more than that amount of money over the rest of their lives.  Some of which comes back to everyone as tax revenue and the good or services the person produces.  A healthier population works better, produces more and makes more money.  That's good for everyone.A healthy populace isn't just a moral goal but a fiscally sound policy.</comment>

<comment>The sad thing is, I've talked to people that I genuinely believe would rather spend MORE money on taxes, etc, if they could know that their money was not going to help someone that didn't "deserve it".</comment>

<comment>You seek to impose upon me burdens I do not wish to carry and then presume to call me selfish?  You are the one who is wrong here, because to compel a man to work for the benefit of another against his will is, and always has been, evil.  It is slavery, regardless how you try and justify it or pretend otherwise.  Nobody has a right for me to take care of them unless I choose to do so.</comment>

<comment>You're not a slave, don't be an idiot.If you are willing to let someone else die so you can feel better about  not being part of a society that cares for each other, you're selfish.</comment>

<comment>You can't really take a moral high road here because you're letting people die every day.  20% of Africa is malnourished and instead of feeding a dozen of them you seem to want to give healthcare to one American.Do you see why believing you are responsible for the fate of others who you have no control over is a foolish endeavor?  The problems are beyond our  means to pay for them without a massive sacrifice in quality of life. You advocate for this because you don't really bear much cost for doing so.  In effect you wish to force pothers to do what you think is right, even though in doing so you're ignoring a billion or more people that are in even greater need than the ones you want to help.Also, there are many definitions of slave.  Here is one:"a person who is strongly influenced and controlled by something"http://www.merriam-webster.com...Guess what, I'm controlled by government tax policy under the same basic threat all the slaves were.  You can pretend you are a free man and defy it, but men with guns will hunt you down if you make that choice.  I may not be whipped or lynched like a disobedient or runaway slave, but I will be chained and thrown into prison.</comment>

<comment>Aw man, what a riot.Lets see...if it cost you 5 dollars a month to know that we would give healthcare to people who will die without it, would it be worth it to you?What if it saved you 5 dollars? Would you still refuse just because it doesn't punish them enough if they don't die for being poor and sick?Go ahead though, you're free to move to Africa or someplace with no government, no taxes, and you'll never be a "slave", even by your ridiculously watered down definition.Sorry though, if you live in this society, you gotta pay your dues.</comment>

<comment>Why should I have to leave because people like you want to take from me against my will?  How about those of you that want to do something do it and leave the rest of us alone?  I don't try and make you come to Church with me on Sunday or own a firearm.As to Africa, please name me one habitable place on Earth without a government .  Please note there is a large difference between no government and a dysfunctional one.</comment>

<comment>I really don't care where you find suitable to live. I'm sure you can find someplace where you don't need to be a part of a proper society.That's not here though, we try to be less selfish.</comment>

<comment>Society isn't defined by the existence of programs that take from one and give to another.  It is defined by shared traditions and laws and values.  We had society long before we had formal government.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, people have to make decisions between paying for care and hoping they don't die.Heck, the small, unnecessary medical expenses DO get affected by the market... Flu shots, antibiotics... But things like casts, stitches, cancer medicine... Things that people can't do without? Things that you get in a hospital and are too afraid to refuse or can't bring it in yourself? They can charge you a few hundred bucks for ibuprofen in the hospital because you have to use theirs.</comment>

<comment>And..this society cares for each other, partially through taxes, social welfare programs, etc.You're free to go find another one if it bothers you.</comment>

<comment>I think I'll stay and just use tax shelters and loopholes to avoid my income being stolen to fund your schemes.  Self-employment has proven a real boon and I've managed to shield over half my income from the nasty payroll taxes it used to be subjected to.</comment>

<comment>Why do you insist on living in a society that takes care of each other while complaining that you live in a society that takes care of each other?Go ahead though, thats what the loopholes are for, and it keeps me in a job.</comment>

<comment>I don't agree that the social programs we have are taking care of anyone. The majority of black children now grow up in single parent homes and I can't help but wonder if income tests on benefits that discourage two parent households doesn't have some effect on that.  I read about a learning program down South to help kids, but some parents kept the kids out of that program because they got more welfare benefits if their kid had the issue the program was trying to fix.</comment>

<comment>Yes yes, whatever.Why don't you move to a society where we don't have a system in place for assistance?</comment>

<comment>That does run counter to the US Constitution. You remember, the one that starts off We the People, ...We, the People, have decided that we want a government to run things.</comment>

<comment>The preamble doesn't grant any powers, it merely established the reasons why the power was granted.</comment>

<comment>but people have voted in politicians who guaranteed health care</comment>

<comment>it merely established the reasons why the power was granted.Bingo. And We the People  decided that we wanted a government to do just those things you whine about.</comment>

<comment>No, We the People did not, a majority of the elected representatives at the time decided that and in the case of the ACA a majority of the people do not support it.</comment>

<comment>Nope. When asked, a majority either want Obamacare as is, expanded, or universal health care. As has been pointed out numerous times, those that want universal health care are lumped in with those unfavorable to the ACA.see http://kff.org/interactive/que...</comment>

<comment>Except that is not the same thing as asking whether your support the ACA or not.  You may also note the largest percentage of respondents chose the "repeal the entire law" option.</comment>

<comment>It's the illusion of free choice when the only choice is "be rich or die"</comment>

<comment>Humanity came from literally nothing potentially 200,000 years ago.  We'll be fine if the government doesn't provide insurance.</comment>

<comment>why don't we go back to bashing each other over the head with rocks too?</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure what the basis for that question is.  Just because the government doesn't provide insurance doesn't mean insurance will cease to exist.  Even without insurance that doesn't mean there won't be healthcare.</comment>

<comment>Insurance as you know it wouldn't exist without government buddyEven before the aca it's one of the more highly regulated industries in the country</comment>

<comment>Who says insurance as I know it is actually a good thing?  Regardless, go read some history, insurance existed long before the government got involved and started screwing it up...http://www.bls.gov/OPUB/MLR/19...</comment>

<comment>Except those aren't your only choices and I don't know why you seem stuck on the notion that an entire universe of possibilities boils down to only two possible actions. Maybe you just aren't very imaginative or maybe you just like a survival instinct.Here, GoFund me is full of people who have raised the money they need for medical procedures and expenses:https://www.gofundme.com/Medic...I see news stories highlighting particular people with funds set up to help them and those stories attract the attention of doctors, clinics, and drug companies that step in to assist for free.  Entire charities exist to help provide needed services.</comment>

<comment>lol your solution to medical bills is GoFund me?</comment>

<comment>No, it is my illustration why your fallacious reasoning based on a false dilemma where the only two possibilities for healthcare absent government are "be rich or die" is wrong.  I just presented a third option that I've proven people use.</comment>

<comment>Begging basically yeah that's a successful social program</comment>

<comment>We aren't talking about successful social programs, we are talking about your logical fallacy.  You present a false dilemma wherein a person must be rich or die when it comes to needing health care that isn't government provided.  That simply isn't true.</comment>

<comment>We're talking about alternatives to dying from illness and having cash on hand for medical treatment.On any kind of scale begging for money is not a solution.  Just like your office's canned food drive is not going to solve world hunger.</comment>

<comment>Luckily none of us exist on that scale, we all exist as individuals and have a whole range of options that can work for us individually regardless of what may not be possible in total.</comment>

<comment>you can just say it you don't care if people die from lack of medical care</comment>

<comment>You seem to equate being unwilling to assist with not caring.  Those are not the same thing at all.</comment>

<comment>The flaw in all arguments like this is that for many Americans it is not a free choice whether or not to obtain healthcare--they simply cannot afford it. Suppose a minimum-wage worker with no insurance contracts a deadly disease for which there is a cure, but that cure costs $200,000. This worker has no "choice" in any meaningful sense of the word whether or not to obtain the cure--the worker simply cannot afford it. What should be done here? In your opinion, the only moral position here is to condemn this person to certain death based on the happenstance that he or she cannot afford the needed cure. I would respectfully suggest that one could make a moral case that it is right for society at large to endeavor, to the extent possible, to secure healthcare for all citizens, in the name of having a safe, healthy, and productive society. Reasonable minds may differ, but describing your position as "the only moral one" is absurd.</comment>

<comment>And the flaw in your argument is that an American worker who can't afford insurance and needs a $200,000 cure is no more deserving of assistance than a malnourished child in Africa that needs $1 of food a day.  So, if you're trying to argue it is somehow my responsibility to help people that need it why would I spend $200,000 to help one single person instead of spending $200,000 to feed 8 African kids for their entire lives?</comment>

<comment>That's a deflection.  It's quite possible for our system to help the American but much harder to help the child in Africa</comment>

<comment>You think writing a check for healthcare is harder than writing a check for food?</comment>

<comment>you think we have less responsibility to our own citizens than people elsewhere in the world?</comment>

<comment>I don't think we have any responsibility to anyone in terms of their care.  I'm trying to point out what happens when you start thinking you do because there is a whole World full of people that are just as deserving as anyone you want to help here, and further we can help way more third World folks with their issues than we can here due to cost.Ultimately I believe our nation's sole obligation is to protect the life and liberty of our citizens.</comment>

<comment>Actually the logistics of getting food to someone in the third world is hardly just writing a check.</comment>
