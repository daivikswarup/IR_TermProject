<comment>Should be interesting</comment>

<comment>Obama should nominate Ted Cruz just to eff with the GOP Senate.</comment>

<comment>That would be fantastic</comment>

<comment>Excellent idea!</comment>

<comment>"...if I believed that any nominee offered by any Republican president would ever meet Schumer’s definition of mainstream; if I hadn’t watched the Democratic Party move further left in the subsequent nine years; if I hadn’t watched the GOP move further right; and if I hadn’t watched both parties dissolve into petty recrimination and dysfunction."Um. Horse shit. Every word of this. Bush got two judges. There was a lot of fussing but they were confirmed. And to suggest the Dems have moved to the left anywhere near to the degree the GOP has gone right is utterly ludicrous and should simply get this person set on permanent ignore.</comment>

<comment>The GOP got freaking Alito! Who they to complain about a judge being too liberal? It seems ideological maniacs are only okay for conservatives.</comment>

<comment>Only one wing of the court votes in lockstep on all of the high-profile cases, and it's not the one with Roberts and Kennedy.</comment>

<comment>It is if you factor out Kennedy.</comment>

<comment>PPACA?</comment>

<comment>Um.  Can I introduce you to Justices Sotamayor and Kagan, speaking of Presidents that got two judges.  And if you've got a problem with Alito, I'll raise your Alito with a Sotamayor.  If you'd put Sotamayor in the definition of "mainstream," you're not really trying to be objective.</comment>

<comment>Reading the actual opinions of Sotomayor and Kagan they are not nearly as ideologically based as Alito. His opinions are founded more often in his religion than the constitution.</comment>

<comment>Same-same with Scalia, Inis.</comment>

<comment>I think the point to draw from all of this is that, absent unusual circumstances, sitting presidents should be able to choose who sits on the SCOTUS. The Senate has a role to play in offering its "advice and consent" to the nominees, but that is different from flat refusing to offer that advice and (potential) consent.</comment>

<comment>Well said. And having one year left in office does not qualify as "unusual circumstances"!</comment>

<comment>Obama only get 3/5ths of a presidency?</comment>

<comment>YOWCH!!!! (big grin)</comment>

<comment>Trump does best with self-described moderates while Sanders is a self-described socialist, a word with hugely negative connotations four years ago. Make of that what you will.</comment>

<comment>I think the fact that he is presenting himself as a revolutionary alternative to mainstream Democratic party politics is telling though. Are Democrats moving left or are progressives sick of the Democrats?</comment>

<comment>What ever happened to the moderate Blue Dog Democrats?  The reason for their decimation explains the shift.</comment>

<comment>Blue Dog Democrats were voted out of office by their Republican-leaning constituents, who would rather have a Republican than a Republican Lite.</comment>

<comment>Precisely, which means the shift is due to the preferences of the voters.</comment>

<comment>Consider the source. When it comes to dishing out high quality horseshit masquerading as conventional wisdom, Fournier is a master.</comment>

<comment>High quality? He compared one Democratic Senator's b.s. the an entire party's b.s., and called it a wash. He hasn't even mastered Basic Obfuscation.</comment>

<comment>It ain't over yet.</comment>

<comment>"I would agree, if I believed that any nominee offered by any Republican president would ever meet Schumer’s definition of mainstream; if I hadn’t watched the Democratic Party move further left in the subsequent nine years; if I hadn’t watched the GOP move further right; and if I hadn’t watched both parties dissolve into petty recrimination and dysfunction."Putting subjective definitions of "mainstream" to the side, the idea that the Democratic Party has definitively moved to the left over the last nine years is not supported by any evidence that I can see. If anything, I would say that the Democratic Party of today, except on certain social issues, is well to the right of where it has been over the last four decades. Perhaps Mr. Fournier hasn't noticed, but this is part of the reason why, in my opinion, Bernie Sanders' campaign is doing relatively well. There is a hunger out there among liberals for someone who speaks their language. Does he believe that Hillary Clinton is somehow representative of the party's alleged leftward drift? Her list of donors and her stated positions on most issues would suggest otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders isn't to the right of anyone.But he is in the right nonetheless.Quite a contradiction, wouldn't you agree?</comment>

<comment>(two different words with same spelling....)</comment>

<comment>Actually, there's a "hunger" for any politician not owned by plutocrats (or not themselves a plutocrat).</comment>

<comment>McConnell is making a huge mistake with this gamble.  Yes, I say a gamble, for the GOP's chances of winning this election are very slim, particularly considering the candidates that are running, and the damage they are doing to each other (not smart).  The old gray haired white males (wasps)  that think they run this party refuse to recognize that they are in the minority!   The GOP has done everything possible to scare off any new blood coming in with their constant battering of the other minority groups.  When you add up all the so called "people of  color", they greatly outnumber the wasps and most lean towards the democrats.  So, lose this election and we end up with a nominee from Hillary (UGH), or even worse, Bernie!  Along with that we will lose the majority position in congress as this "throw the bums out" mentality continues.  Makes a person want to volunteer for Mars.</comment>

<comment>You b*tch about old white Republicans, but your two candidates are also old and white.So who did you hate more- white people or senior citizens?</comment>

<comment>You forgot to ask him when he stopped beating his wife, spudsie.</comment>

<comment>Why do you assume he is heterosexual? Do you hate gays?</comment>

<comment>Only Elton John.</comment>

<comment>One is Jewish, and the other one is a woman. So what we get from your post is that all you see is skin color.  So which one of those do you hate more?</comment>

<comment>That's funny - that a progressive would complain about somebody "only seeing skin color". The race card is the only card in your deck.</comment>

<comment>> The race card is the only card in your deck.You're not supposed to show what an unabashed hypocrite you are in the same article. Or at least make us scroll up or down a little to show how you do something in one place then whine about progressives doing it in another. You have the hypocrisy, dial-a-meme, and the "I know you are, but what am I?" cards, yet you're still not playing with a full deck. Now run along, you anti-Semitic Israel hater; don't you have a war on women to wage somewhere?> "only seeing skin color"You should see an American grammar book as to where periods go in relation to quotation marks.

<comment>So, let me get this straight; when you use "I know you are, but what am I?" as a response, that's being a hypocrite?  I remember you responding to me with "I know you are, but what am I?" but then telling someone else that "I know you are, but what am i" is not a valid response. I'm so old I remember when that qualifies you as a hypocritical moron.Well, isn't it just hilarious when morons come full circle? Sorry, I'm done invading your safe space.</comment>

<comment>> So, let me get this straight; when you use "I know you are, but what am I?" as a response, that's being a hypocrite?No George. IKYABWAI is when someone just switches the argument to someone else. Being a hypocrite means having different expectations than from yourself. Both are neither mutually inclusive or exclusive.

<comment>McConnell is not miscalculating, he's playing to his base. He's got to be smarter than this--I mean he's an elected official for chrissakes...Although I guess that doesn't mean anything, considering the current R lineup. He'll tiptoe enough to look "OK" to his peeps, but there's no way he's taking this risk in an election year.</comment>

<comment>There's also the matter of the Senate to consider. 34 Senate seats come up in this election year (not including two retirements), and when you consider that there are more seats in play (seven or ten, depending on who you listen to) than the GOP majority (three more than the 51 needed), the GOP has a tough time navigating between satisfying their base and not further pissing off the moderate/undecided/independent/centrist voters. For the GOP to lose *both* the White House and the Senate would be a disaster to the party.....</comment>

<comment>"The GOP has done everything possible to scare off any new blood coming in with their constant battering of the other minority groups."This is so funny...just look at the two parties' Presidential candidates. On the GOP side, two young Hispanic Senators, one somewhat elderly African-American doctor, one young Indian-American governor, one elderly militant moderate buffoon tycoon, a female CEO, moderate east coast governors, conservative southern governors, etc.The Democrats? Two elderly, washed up lefties with scarcely any ideas that weren't hatched with Marx or the Progressive era from 100 years ago. The diversity? One is honest about what he believes. The other is Hillary, who is not honest about anything.</comment>

<comment>If the Republicans don't like the nominee they should grow some balls, have a vote, and reject the person.Scalia's body isn't even cold yet but they already said they would not even consider a nominee until Obama leaves office 11 months from now.  That's abrogating their constitutional duty.</comment>

<comment>http://www.wsj.com/articles/bo..." Senate Democrats tried to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee in 1967, applied ideological tests against plainly qualified nominees starting in 1971, both used and abolished the filibuster against lower-court nominees when it suited their purposes, and argued nine years ago for reversing “the presumption of confirmation.” Somehow they never prepared for the possibility of a Supreme Court vacancy under a Democratic president and a Republican Senate. But then, this is the first time that’s happened since 1895.As is their wont, progressives are trying to drum up a sense of crisis to get their way. “Scalia’s Death Plunges Court, National Politics Into Turmoil,” a Washington Post headline claims. Slate warns of a “constitutional crisis” if the Senate fails to defer to the president. Brent Staples, a New York Times editorialist, even tries to reopen the Civil War: “In a nation built on slavery, white men propose denying the first black president his Constitutional right to name Supreme Court nominee,” he asserted in a Saturday tweet, deleted in the face of widespread mockery.We know the recipe. It’s two parts pure applesauce, one part argle-bargle and a dash of jiggery-pokery. There is no constitutional crisis, but at most a political one of the sort that has arisen repeatedly over the past half-century. The country is not in turmoil; it’s just the usual Obama-era ugliness. And slavery was abolished by the 13th Amendment, a constitutional provision even many progressives are willing to respect as written.Republicans shouldn’t have any trouble preventing Obama from replacing Scalia during this congressional term. The big question is: Can they win the political argument over the future of the Supreme Court?"</comment>

<comment>If the Republicans refuse even a hearing, then it is a Constitutional crisis, since the Senate is obligated to positively respond to a nomination with an up-or-down vote. It wouldn't even be the only Constitutional crisis triggered by the Republicans, in the Obama era - under the goading of Ted Cruz, the House in 2013 pushed the United States to the brink of invalidating its public debt. But an act of pure Constitutional obstruction like this will be a disaster for the Republicans running for the Senate in the fall.</comment>

<comment>You should maybe re-read the Constitution, specifically Article 2 section 2, because the Senate isn't obligated to even consider the President's nomination.The "he' mention below is the President:"and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court"https://www.law.cornell.edu/co...</comment>

<comment>Right - "he... shall appoint" - let's look carefully at this. The necessary and sufficient conditions for appointing a new Justice, are that the president nominates, and the Senate disposes. This disposing does not include acts of omission - such acts are not what the verbs "advice and consent" connote. The language does not say, nor does it imply, that the Senate can "abstain," "defer," "delay," or "withhold" its consent. Instead the Senate must act affirmatively, pursuant to the president's power to "appoint." If the Senate did not have to act affirmatively, then this power would be a dead letter; which obviously is the opposite of what the Constitution says. If your interpretation was correct, the Senate could effectively strip the president of his (explicitly stated) power to appoint, simply by refusing to act. But your interpretation is not correct; it is unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>You are inferring more than the words actually require.  You might benefit from a bit of Constitutional history regarding the actual discussions that took place on this "advice and consent" bit.  James Madison actually proposed Congress have a discretionary veto on nominees under which the nominee is appointed unless Congress specifically votes against it within a fixed number of days.  This was rejected in favor of "advice and consent" which was the method present in the Mass. legislature prior to the ratification of the Constitution.  This paper goes into details on that as well:http://www.law.harvard.edu/stu...</comment>

<comment>The paper you linked to makes the claim, "the suggestion that the obligation is implicit in the Advice and Consent Clause does not appear to comport with the Framers’ understanding of the term" (i.e., the term(s) Advice and Consent). Now, the fact that the text of the Constitution is not explicit enough on the matter of the meaning of these terms, suggests that we need to resort to looking for insight into the contemporary meanings of these terms, in other documents. But the paper acknowledges openly that it's a matter of interpretation, whether the materials they resort to (Massachusetts' advice and consent model) are the best for the purpose. I think it more likely that this is one of the places in the Constitution, where the language was kept deliberately vague.Anyway, I don't think that my interpretation of 'advice and consent' is forced. There is a very important difference between affirming a proposition/nomination (including affirming its denial), and withholding judgment on it altogether.Article 2 is explicitly concerned with important decision-making prerogatives of the Executive, to fill Constitutionally named government offices. The purpose of the Article is giving the procedure for making appointments. Hence it's reasonable to assume that the Senate's prerogatives of 'advice and consent' are pursuant to accomplishing this goal. Withholding judgment on nominees doesn't serve this purpose; indeed it runs precisely contrary to it.  So, in light of this context it is reasonable to assume that if the Framers had intended that 'advice and consent' include the discretion to ignore the Executive's nominees, they would have rendered this explicitly in the text. They did not.So, it's not just a matter of trying to divine the precise meanings of 'advice and consent.' It's also about the very logic of making appointments, a logic embedded in the text. As I mentioned, the Constitution gives the Executive the role of agent in making appointments to the Courts (as I put it, the Executive has the role of being the "necessary condition" for the appointment of these officers). These appointments are of course a practical necessity for the government to function - particularly in the case of the Supreme Court.'Advice and consent' is the Senate's veto-power on these nominees. Assent by the Senate is the sufficient condition for the elevation of the nominee. A sufficient condition, in other words, for the performance of a power that the Constitution explicitly states that the Executive has - the power of appointment. As long as the Senate acts positively on the nomination of the President's proposed candidate (i.e., assenting or rejecting the nominee) we don't have a problem.But when/if the Senate simply refuses to consider a nomination, the whole purpose of the Article 2 is defeated. With his nominee in Limbo, the President is powerless to act to appoint; he cannot nominate someone else while his original nominee is left to dangle. How is this not unconstitutional on its face? It strips a power from the President that the Constitution explicitly says he has; and moreover this is a clear violation of the separation of powers. And all the while, the crucial practical task of filling key government positions goes undone. No reasonable interpretation of the Constitution would say that the Framers were providing for the possibility of this kind of outcome.</comment>

<comment>Bravo. Well argued! Doesn't get the next Justice on the bench however.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a issue on interpreting the Constitution!Let's take ti to the now 8 member Supreme Courtwhat happens we we end up with a 4-4 split?</comment>

<comment>If the "shalls" are binding on the President in that sentence, then they are binding on the Senate as well. They cannot provide their advice and consent if they refuse to conduct hearings or consider the nominee. By your logic, a Senate intent on true obstructionism could simply refuse to consider any SCOTUS nominees from day 1 of an 8 year presidential administration, no matter how many seats were left vacant, and not derogate from its constitutional duty. Luckily, we construe statutes based on their reasonable meaning which, in this case, does not allow the Senate to simply ignore a presidential nominee for the SCOTUS.</comment>

<comment>There is only one shall.  He shall nominate.  As far as consent goes, consent means approval, which is an affirmative action, so by not taking action they are fulfilling their duty since it is a form of not consenting.</comment>

<comment>Well, actually there are two shalls and they both matter for purposes of understanding the President's role and the Senate's. Obviously they are not obliged to consent, which is by definition an act of volition. However, by refusing to even consider any candidate, they are failing in their constitutional duty to "advise" the President about a nominee or create conditions by which consent might be given or withheld. McConnell's statement if carried out, will violate both the letter and spirit of Article 2, Sec. 2. If I am wrong about the meaning of the section, then the next time one party holds the Senate when a member of the opposite party is elected President, the Senate majority leader may simply announce that the Senate will not be considering any Supreme Court nominees during the present administration. Of course, it's not only a constitutional issue, since the Senate itself enacted legislation in 1869 requiring that there be one chief justice and eight associates. By refusing to carry out its constitutional duty, the Senate would also ensure the derogation of a law that it put on the books almost 150 years ago. If McConnell had said nothing, and predictably stonewalled the hell out of whomever Obama nominated, I would have far less of a problem with it, given the unfortunate tenor of our politics today. But, as he and his cohorts so often do, he overplayed his hand and will come off looking far worse when he eventually backtracks.</comment>

<comment>Have no Senators advised the President they will not consider his nominee?</comment>

<comment>They can't knowingly reject a nominee who hasn't yet been named. McConnell's statements are an apparent denial of Obama's power to nominate, in light of the upcoming election. There is no precedent for such a notion, and it certainly isn't in the constitutional text. If Republicans want to hold themselves out as the principled constitutionalist party, which they so often do, McConnell's ill-conceived statement really undermines that whole premise.</comment>

<comment>Tell you what, have the Attorney General sue the Senate majority leader and in two years when it's worked its way through the Courts you'll have your answer.</comment>

<comment>Stop posting verbatim opinion pieces. It is lame, whether the commentary is conservative or liberal.</comment>

<comment>It is a great opinion piece that was sent to me so I wanted to post - if you do not like it, skip it.</comment>

<comment>I'm not suggesting that you can't post it. Just that's its lame to post someone else's opinion verbatim in a comments section.</comment>

<comment>I disagree. If commenters are likely not to have heard or be aware of the quote, and the post adds to the conversation without derailing it, and the quote is substantive, and isn't too long - lots of caveats, but given them - why not?</comment>

<comment>I don't object to quotes per se. But this is not a quote. It is the bulk of a lengthy opinion piece without any additional commentary. I know, no one elected me the comment board police...</comment>

<comment>I take your point.</comment>

<comment>Their job is to get elected and re-elected. That's it.</comment>

<comment>Regardless of one's politics I think you've got to love: "It’s two parts pure applesauce, one part argle-bargle and a dash of jiggery-pokery." Scalia did have a way with words.</comment>

<comment>There's a big difference between holding a hearing and rejecting and not holding a hearing at all. GOP obstructionism is on full display.</comment>

<comment>Not really a big difference. Everyone understands a hearing would be kabuki theatre. This is much more decent, and saves a sacrificial lamb from having to go through the personal pain of a contentious hearing.</comment>

<comment>The difference is between what's constitutional, and what's not. The Republicans are teeing it up for the Democrats this election year: the party of radical obstruction is not fit for office.</comment>

<comment>If the Senate conducts a hearing and, in rejecting a nominee, has to explain its reasons to the American public, that is a far different thing from simply hanging out the "Back in 12 months" shingle and declining to vote. McConnell would have obstructed any nominee no matter what, but he would have to explain why a potentially-worthy candidate is unworthy rather than falling back on some bizarre conception of democracy, by which the nameless future president's mandate exceeds the current, democratically-elected president's mandate.</comment>

<comment>Especially if Obama taps an appellate judge that the Senate has already confirmed for a lower court.</comment>

<comment>Yea, weirdly enough people don't want Amnesty, people don't want to lose their guns, and people don't want to be persecuted for being Christians.Shocking, right?</comment>

<comment>Must...warn...others...</comment>

<comment>I've been persecuting peole for being Christians as much as possible. Everywhere you go, you see Christians being  persecuted for being Christians. ItAs YUUUUGE. Problem.Do have, like, a single example of people being persecuted for being Christians?</comment>

<comment>No Christian doctrine was about prosecution of people for heresy.</comment>

<comment>Let's get rid of political parties.</comment>

<comment>Which is one of the first things that the extreme right or left does when they gain control of a country.</comment>

<comment>Apples and oranges. Schumer is just a Senator and especially back when he made those remarks he wasn't even in the leadership at all. McConnell, however, is the Majority Leader -- completely in charge of the Senate and the GOP conference. Schumer's remarks are just one guy. McConnell is speaking for his whole party.</comment>

<comment>Yep, another bipartisan stalemate. Should've known this would happen so close to election year, it's almost as if Obama is already out of office.</comment>

<comment>What the Republicans are demonstrating is that the whole nonsense Roberts and Alito peddled about judges being neutral umpires who call balls and strikes was never true. Republicans, like Democrats, want a justice who leans strongly their way or they prefer a vacant seat.Well watch what you wish for. A President Clinton with a majority of dems in the Senate will pick someone who leans way left, several someones if this keeps up.</comment>

<comment>Or maybe a stock market crash or terrorist attack has Trump nominating our judges...</comment>

<comment>You can always hope for the worst.</comment>

<comment>I'd say the odds are 30/70 that America would choose a plutocrat born on third base in response to a crashed stock market. The smart play is for you to move all those chips to "terrorist attack"...</comment>

<comment>It was Biden who stone-walled Bork, so don't tell me how the liberals hands are clean in these types of poo fights because they aren't.</comment>

<comment>Bork was denied, which is constitutionally legitimate, and then the GOP got its nominee through. That's how it works. The GOP is not refusing to even consider any nominee advanced by Obama. Explain how that is legitimate?</comment>

<comment>Complaining about something that hasn't even happened yet. It took Reagan 3 tries to get his man. Let the process play out, but don't expect any favors.</comment>

<comment>Ah yes an article by a professional pundit trying to paint the parties as equally wrong and at fault.  Where is James Fallows with the false equivalency report.  Pretending that the democrats have drifted further left and the republicans have drifted further right in equal degrees is sheer fantasy.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you understood his point. It wasn't that the Dems have become more left-wing, it is that they've become more partisan and rigid and beholden to special interests. more partisan doesn't mean more left-wing.And many of us who lean towards the left would agree with him, hence our support for Bernie Sanders. </comment>

<comment>The author says that the Dems have moved "further left." I wonder how so?</comment>

<comment>mea culpa, you're right. I missed that one line. That being said, i still think his overall argument is correct.</comment>

<comment>Only white people support Sanders because politics is a game for them. They can't understand that losing the presidency is literally life and death for folks of color. So if white liberals want a Social Democrat nominating judges, all they have to do is end racism first. No big deal, right?</comment>

<comment>In truth we can only speculate on what Democrats would do under similar circumstances - which has no basis in journalism or in how Republicans should react. We know however, what Republicans are doing and what their plan is and therefore we should give their behavior the critical commentary it deserves. Stop making this out to be about dysfunctional government when it's really about Republican malfeasance.</comment>

<comment>This is what happens when the parties dissolve.Liberals are openly courting terrorists like Black Lives Matter and Republicans are openly courting Evangelical nutcases.Result?Hyper partisan supreme court fight</comment>

<comment>"Terrorists?" Well, count that as another word that we can no longer use in its intended sense, because it has been hijacked for purposes of political slander. When everybody is a terrorist, nobody is.</comment>

<comment>Seriously?you are terrified of black lives matter? What acts of terrorism have they committed?</comment>

<comment>Seeing black people in large groups terrifies a certain kind of person.</comment>

<comment>Especially when they're rioting.</comment>

<comment>Stop projecting your sexual fantasies on others. BLM has been harassing the "Y'allq'aeda" cowboys in Oregon. And before that, BLM tried to terrorize other KKK Nazi bigots (apparently, or so Vox tells me): http://21stcenturywire.com/wp-...</comment>

<comment>Stop being an equivocating and sanctimonious "fair and balanced" moron, plz.</comment>

<comment>This is pretty ridiculous. The GOP is actively doing something unprecedented, but both parties are to blame because the democrats might do the same thing, if they had the chance. Based on no evidence at all.False equivalence at its finest</comment>

<comment>That's classic Fournier: blaming the Republicans for something they have done, and blaming Democrats for something they have done only in his mind.Robert Bork _was_ outside the judicial mainstream; I don't care how brilliant he was. Anyone Obama nominates almost certainly will not be.</comment>

<comment>Bork was unanimously confirmed by the Senate for the United States Court of Appeals, yet when he was nominated to be on the Supreme Court, Democrats who had voted for his nomination to the Court of Appeals thwarted his nomination to the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>Higher standards for the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>Not only higher standards, but also more data on which to evaluate. When nominated to the Supreme Court, he could be evaluated on everything he was evaluated on for his appointment to the Circuit Court, PLUS his new record from his decisions on the Circuit Court.</comment>

<comment>Bork also got hearings and a votethats pretty different from not even waiting to hear the nominee's name and rejecting them already</comment>

<comment>I watched King Asshat's presser today. What a petulant little jerk-off. </comment>

<comment>LOL. Obama's all about outside the mainstream.</comment>

<comment>Only if your definition of "outside the mainstream" = twice won a majority vote in a general election.Robert Bork's vision of the First Amendment, for example, is not one that conservatives or liberals would support today.</comment>

<comment>Way before Bork there was Republican Joe McCarthy laying into William Brennan, accusing him in the nomination hearings of being a communist.It's not one party or the other.</comment>

<comment>Bork was a nutcase.The GOP are saying they don't even CARE who Obama's nominee is.That's quite different</comment>

<comment>Both sides, Ron, seriously?Have the Democrats ever refused to allow any action on a nominee? Or did they just indicate they would vote against someone who they didn't accept?Can you see that one of these things is not like the other?</comment>

<comment>Thank you, Ron. Both sides have caused so much tension.Democrats escalated the rhetoric, so now the Republicans are fighting back.Not surprising.</comment>

<comment>So far, during Obama's time in the White House, the Republicans have acted like a bunch of brat kids, rejecting anything proposed by a Democrat. Fortunately, the Republican membership doesn't represent a majority of Americans. If Republicans play their game with an Obama nominee, that would, in my opinion, hurt them at the polls in November.</comment>

<comment>"If the roles were reversed and a Republican sat in the Oval Office, I believe Democrats would block the lame duck’s nominee. "Like most Republicans, Fournier believes a lot of things that aren't remotely plausible.</comment>

<comment>I have no doubt they would if the roles were reversed.  Obama tried to filibuster Alito and voted against Roberts.  Schumer, a Senior member of the Democrats a year and a half before Bush was due to leave office saying they wouldn't approve any Bush Nominee except in "extraordinary circumstances."  Bork. Payback.  Well, it won't happen, the Republicans will fold, they always fold for Obama.</comment>

<comment>I like how you construct your false equivalencies! Note the language: Obama VOTED against Roberts. In your mind, voting against a nominee is the same thing as preventing a vote on the nominee.I'm curious: how many hours a day is your TV tuned to Fox News? 15? 16?</comment>

<comment>Obama filibustered Alito.  He didn't want to allow a vote.  I guess we know you get all your news from MSNBC and DailyKOS.</comment>

<comment>> except in "extraordinary circumstances."Most people of the non-moronic type would consider a death to be an extraordinary circumstance> Republicans will fold, they always fold for Obama.Hence the record number of filibusters. There's plenty more if you give reality a chance.</comment>

<comment>Only a complete idiot would think that why the vacancy happens has any bearing on weather it is extraordinary or not.</comment>

<comment>> why the vacancy happens has any bearing on weather it is extraordinary or not.So obviously stupid, I'll just let it sit there.> bearing on weatherI know one moron who'd never get a brainstorm.  *psst* it's you.</comment>

<comment>Your position is so weak you are reduced to attacking grammar.  Pathetic.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes they would, and you would back them.</comment>

<comment>The emphasis on the Supreme Court is a symptom of our disfunction. Wake up guys, the reason the Republican party moves right and the Dems move left is because that is how Washington controls us. Reading some of the comments here from people who don't think the democrat party has moved left is hysterical. The dems lost the Senate and the house and more state legislatures than under any Democrat president. Politicians would normally call this a message. But rather than listen to the message, the democrats are in the process of nominating either a socialist or a criminal. We do not need a savior either in the White House or on the Supreme Court. We need to get back to first principles and recognize that we have to persuade people because their vote counts just as much as ours. This constant denying of the other side's legitimacy is just nuts. Barack Obama has sowed distrust and animus since his first days as President. He blew an unbelievable opportunity to lead this country and the world at a pivotal moment in history. He views Republicans as the enemy, and by extension the hundred million plus American citizens they represent. Of course they will block his nominee. And of course the democrats would do the same. We shouldn't have so much riding on whether a conservative or progressive is on the bench.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure why people are calling him a lame-duck president..He's not. Are they just trying to paint him as a president that's already out of office? It's a ways to go before that happens...way too long to refuse to even vote on a new nominee.</comment>

<comment>Yeah – total bullshite. In that view, immediately upon reelection for a second term, every President (or two term limited politician) is a "lame duck"**except of course the scumbag Bloomberg: the peoples' mandate doesn't apply to him. He is rich.</comment>

<comment>Oy vey, goy. Admit it, you hate Bloomie because he's a Jew who was tough on crime in NYC and you're black.</comment>

<comment>The Poser is almost out the back door.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats are theoretically just as bad as the Republicans actually are? What does that even mean?</comment>

<comment>It means nothing.</comment>

<comment>Nothing that you have the intellectual honesty or introspection to comprehend. Oh, look, there's another brave article about black transwomen who are "bravely" campaigning for lowering the age of consent in The New Yorker! Quick, read that and feel smug in your appreciation of intersectional progressivism.</comment>

<comment>Your choice to bring trans people into this argument about Ron Fornier's false equivalency mimeograph series is telling.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, and guess what, that's the majority who will ensure that you get carted off to the Democratic People's Republic of Kanadistan to be with you kebab-bait sex symbol, Justine "I'm-a-pretty-lady" Trudeau, when Der Trumpenführer gets elected.</comment>

<comment>I think you must be responding to somebody else, because nothing *you* said has anything to do with anything *I* said.  You know, relevance.</comment>

<comment>I like the evenhandedness of pointing out that both parties have bad actors.Still, we must demand the Constitution be followed and not partisan advantage.</comment>

<comment>You only demand that because it favors your leanings. You would say something quite to the contrary if it was reversed (i.e. lame duck GOP prez with Dem majority and an election looming where the Dem candidate was expected to win).</comment>

<comment>Why are you calling Obama a lame duck president?I don't think your accusation of hypothetical hypocricy holds up though, Democrats have sworn people in within the last part of their presidency, and the whole "refusing nominations before the nomination has even been made" is a new level of crap.</comment>

<comment>Your statement is fact-free.You don't know me at all.</comment>

<comment>I don't need to "know" you, lard-ass. Your politics speak for "who you are".</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm sure that type of response wins you many arguments. You have played your cards perfectly, sir!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, stop signalling your pretense at a "moral high ground", you're just a fedora with internet access.</comment>

<comment>I don't own a fedora, but thanks for playing.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution does not say the Senate has to rubber stamp Obama's nominations.  Remember the Bork.</comment>

<comment>Heck, I remember Brennan being called a communist by Republican Joe McCarthy.That's a fun game to play, "But He Did It First."Can we agree that we are a Democratic Republic that has a Constitution which is supreme and whose dicta are supreme, not political spin?Like you, I am tired of partisanship.The solution isn't further onstruction of Constitutional order, but fidelity to it.Mitch McConnell did say that when he took over the gavel he'd restore regular order.Time for him to grow up and follow his own promise.</comment>

<comment>His promise of following the Constitution, you mean?The same Constitution that says the Senate shall "advise and consent" a Supreme Court nomination. It seems they are advising. Also, real originalists know that there is not a Constitutionally-mandated number of SCOTUS justices. At no point does it say we must have 9 judges. SCOTUS started out with 6 judges and now all of a sudden the work can't be completed without 9 justices?You can make light of us saying "but he did it first" but i'd like you to look at the flip side of this. Bork was delayed for 2 years by the very Senator Schumer blasting us for SCOTUS votes now. Heck, Schumer said he would stop all nominations BEFORE there was even an opening on the court!I'm not fond of saying "he did it first" but it makes absolutely no sense that Schumer and the Democrats did it, but now all of a sudden the GOP has to stand down and bite their tongue? We're tired of the double standards.</comment>

<comment>"Real originalists" would do well to look up the Judiciary Act of 1869 which provides that the SCOTUS shall consist of a chief justice and 8 associate justices. Then, those real originalists could go and look up the powers of the Congress enumerated in Article 1 and recognize that Congress has the power to make such a law. So, for our purposes, the Judiciary Act of 1869 is the law of the land. Congress decided that the number is 9. Congress is free to change that number if it wishes by legislation. There is plenty of precedent for it. But until that happens, the Senate has a duty to consider presidential nominees for the SCOTUS under Article 2, Section 2. The fact that the Constitution doesn't fix the number of justices is irrelevant to this subject.</comment>

<comment>Congress sets the number of justices on the court.  It was changed a few times, but the current number was set in 1869.  So unless Congress changes it again, the court must have 9 justices by law.</comment>

<comment>Bork was delayed for 2 years by the very Senator Schumer...Bork was nominated by Reagan on July 1, 1987. The senate vote to reject him was taken October 23, 1987. Moreover, Chuck Schumer was not elected to the senate until 1998. You somehow have problems dealing with this new-fangled Gregorian calendar.</comment>

<comment>I want the Republicans to bork anyone Obama puts forth.  I'm tried of the Democrats and their partisanship for me, not for thee.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm good for simply following the Constitution</comment>

<comment>Oh yea.  The left wants to now follow the Constitution.  The Constitution says the Senate gives advise and consent.</comment>

<comment>Yes, exactly.What is puzzling about that?</comment>

<comment>why just now?</comment>

<comment>Bork got a hearing and got voted down.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Bork got voted down in the Judiciary Committee but insisted that a vote of the full senate be taken on him. His wish was granted and he was roundly rejected there.</comment>

<comment>Nothing unconstitutional about the Senate withholding consent.  The nominee cannot be seated without consent of the senate.The constitution places no deadlines, or restrictions on the consent of the senate.This president has been activly engaged in behavior in defiance of the constitution, the deliberate and premeditated killing of American citizens without due process of law (killing of Anwar AlAwaki), making war without the consent of congress (Libya,  Yemen, Syria), and so on.  Refusal to consider any nominee of his for anything is not unreasonable.</comment>

<comment>The solution to allegations of infidelity to law is to be faithful to the law.Scalia himself said no more than 60 days should pass before a vacant seat on the Supreme Court is filled.</comment>

<comment>No basis in the constitution or law to say the senate must consent at all, let alone by some deadline.</comment>

<comment>Scalia himself was not only a textualist, and originalist, he was the godfather of that legal school.  He would be the first to say, so what if Nino said that, what does the constitution say.</comment>

<comment>He didn't declare war in those cases, as only Congress can do that.  He did have authority granted by Congress, and as Commander-in-Chief of the military.  I'd assume the legal justification for taking out an enemy of the state is pretty straightforward.</comment>

<comment>He made war without consent of congress, that is illegal.Al Awaki did not have so much as a warrent out for his arrest.  No basis to call him an enemy of the state.If you want to in any way molest or harrass an American citizen anywhere in the world the US Government needs to follow due process of law.You need an arrest warrent to attempt to arrest him.Their is no legal basis to kill an American citizen without exigent circumstances (which did not exist) or due process of law in which he has been convicted of a capital crime and a death sentance imposed.Neither of those existed, so Obama's order to kill Al Awaki was murder.</comment>

<comment>Congress hasn't done so since WW2.  It didn't declare war in Iraq.  The same authorization to fight terrorists was used.So go join ISIS, as your bro did al queda.  Help out some future attackers as he did with 9/11 hijackers.  Become their spokesman and proclaim yourself to be an enemy of the state.  I won't miss you one bit when a drone takes you out.</comment>

<comment>I do not want to fight dipstick.   I do not want my tax money spent on illegal wars.That congress has not declared war since WWII is not strictly true.   See the gulf of tonkin resolution, and various other legal authorizations by congress.My point is Obama is off the reservation, he has attacked nations without consent of congress.</comment>

<comment>The President does not need Congress' approval to do everything.  Their failure to deliver a new authorization for action against ISIS while simultaneously chastising him for not doing enough is exactly why.</comment>

<comment>Everything no, commit acts of war on other nations, yes.Very explicit in the constitution, only congress has the power to go pick fights with other nations.</comment>

<comment>http://www.heritage.org/consti...</comment>

<comment>Try the 10th amendment for starters.  The president and congress only have the specific powers they were delegated in the constitution.The CONGRESS can declare war, nor is any war made legal unless congress says so.The powers of the president are listed, and don't include making war on other nations.</comment>

<comment>I know what is in the text of the Constitution.  That doesn't change the fact that there have been many more wars fought than the 5 that Congress declared, and throwing around the FoxNews standard issue crap isn't going to make his actions less legal than any other Commander-in-Chief.</comment>

<comment>Yes actually that does make his actions illegal.  Congress has the lawful power to make war, the president does not, and should not.Read the federalist papers.</comment>

<comment>Ok. I look forward to you charging every President and the outcome of your trials.</comment>

<comment>"not partisan advantage"? Has anything this shitbag done over the last 7 years not been soaked with "partisan advantage"?</comment>

<comment>I can see by your use of the term "shitbag" that you are a serious person, with serious ideas and capable of expressing them seriously.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I had to censor my words. I can't say what I actually think about the shitsack.</comment>

<comment>Sure you can. He's black.</comment>

<comment>That's only part of it </comment>

<comment>Your response is non-parsable and apparently not related to what I posted.</comment>

<comment>Completely related to that partisan hack.</comment>

<comment>Now judges die and some retire. It has been that way sence the first court convened. It has gone back and forth all that time. Presidents can only have two terms in office. So that evens that out. Right now the President of the United States is Mr.Obama he has held that spot for 7+ years. By law he must nominate a person to fill one of the most important positions in American Government. He is a Democrat, just like Reagan was Republican and Bush 1 and Bush 2. They to had a job to do and did it. You must remember Bush nominated Judge Thomas. You know him the silent one. Talks only when his big Republican wife tell him too.</comment>

<comment>Ron, you dolt. The false equivalency you're making, between one Democratic Senator and the entire GOP, is ridiculous. It wouldn't pass muster in Rhetoric 101.</comment>

<comment>You're right, goy, the Democratic party is very principled and all about fairness and honesty in its dealings and would never play the system to their advantage to continue to shift the Overton window to the left with their ever-more shill left-liberal "progressive" bent.</comment>

<comment>You're right goy,  when one party is a lot worse than another party to play the system to their advantage, it's actually the same somehow, and you're not some equivocating moron and partisan shill that tries the tired old "they're the same" routine.</comment>

<comment>HEY LET O SEND THEM--THE REPUBS HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO CONFIRM---AND NOT ALL THE DEMS SAYING JUST A FEW YEARS AGO SAYING THAT THEY SHOULD NOT CONFIRM DURING AN ELECTION YEAR --SO HYPOCRITICAL!</comment>

<comment>I am GIDDY that the Republicans are going to try this hot mess of a plan in an election year.</comment>

<comment>No one but liberal special interest groups care</comment>

<comment>It's like shutting down the government for eight months until election day.</comment>

<comment>Never underestimate the GOP to completely F this up!</comment>

<comment>This article is what center-right people must tell themselves to get to sleep at night.  I'm embarrassed for Fournier.  I really am.  His party is being torn asunder by the rabid emotion of the base, a dysfunctional conservative media, and donor control of policy.  He's been reduced to meekly arguing that well Democrats have problems as well.   If we were voting for President of False Equivalences, Fournier would win in a landslide.</comment>

<comment>Ah yes. The old "Both sides do it!" shuck and jive.You've presented a nearly text book example of false equivalence, FournierAnd people wonder why mainstream reporting seems to be dying</comment>

<comment>Republicans are angry.So what's new? It would be a real news flash if they were calm and happy and forward looking.</comment>

<comment>Can I ask a question?  Seriously.  Why is the "...Republican base is angry and opposed to any accommodation with Democrats...?"  From my perspective, they're angry about two things:1.  There's a black guy in the White House.2.  They've been left behind economically.Suffice it to say that re point 1, being angry that a black guy is in the White House isn't really a good reason not to even consider a nominee.  Of course, given that the Tea Party didn't metastasize until there was a black guy in the White House, and that Teapublicans have been working to stymie Obama for the entirety of his two terms, this is really par for the course.Re point 2, the Republican base has been left behind economically thanks to the people they elected, and who are now vowing to block even considering a nominee.  So while it's not surprising that they're "angry," they really have no one to blame but themselves.</comment>

<comment>This article is as fine an example of false equivalence as you'll ever see. No, Mr. Fournier, both sides aren't equally at fault. The nomination process didn't become corrupted until Ronald Reagan and Ed Meese concocted their plan to pack the federal judiciary with Federalist Society ideologues in a brazen effort to rig the game by recasting constitutional law in a direction more suitable to their political preferences. It's all gone downhill since then.</comment>

<comment>Robert Bork.</comment>

<comment>A prime example of the kind of out-of-the-mainstream extremist judge that Reagan and Meese wanted to pack the Court with. Unlike Obama's prospective nominee, Bork got a fair hearing. Thankfully for America, he wasn't confirmed..</comment>

<comment>Fournier:  The GOP responds to their "special interest" groups with clearly unconstitutional acts, and the Democrats do not respond that way to their "special interest" groups. So they're equally bad. Or something.</comment>

<comment>"More to the point, Schumer tipped his hand elsewhere in the July 2007 address. “We should reverse the presumption of confirmation,” he said at the American Constitution Society convention in Washington."Um, Ron, this "tipped his hand"...how, exactly? Did you fail to notice that he used the word "confirmation", not "hearings"? Having some cognitive difficulties, are we?</comment>

<comment>Sounds to me like someone forgot to lead...</comment>

<comment>Republicans are angry. Alert the media.</comment>

<comment>Pee and shit in your own faces conservatives!</comment>

<comment>Oh, the delicious irony.  The reason so many Americans are angry is because SCOTUS took it upon themselves to FORCE change on an unwilling nation.  That is not their job.  Abortion and Same Sex Marriage are the two most obvious cases, but there are others, and both sides are angry because SCOTUS put themselves in the position of deciding who wins.  Each loss makes the losing side more angry, and each victory does nothing to make the winning side less angry.The Constitution was written to allow the people of Texas decide issues for Texas and the people of Vermont decide issues for Vermont.  When SCOTUS decided to replace that system with Rule by Judicial Fiat, they created the conditions we have today.My guy had better vote the way I want him to.  Or else.  And he knows it.</comment>

<comment>States can do whatever they want? Read the Supremacy Clause. You're confusing the Constitution with the Articles of Confederation.</comment>
