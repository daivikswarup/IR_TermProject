<comment>A civil discussion in which most of false narratives of the NRA were dispelled.1. None of the president's orders inhibit a law abiding individual's right to purchase or own.2. Orders ask for greater mental health, ATF investment to enforce existing laws.3. He's still not coming for anyone's guns.An incremental change is not an absolute change. Be suspicious all you want. If anything remotely approaching confiscation were to be proposed, it'd need to happen in Congress first.I applaud the President. The NRA's absence was duly noted and cowardly.</comment>

<comment>Those tears were Oscar quality. Barry needs to lower his Estrogen levels.</comment>

<comment>Good thing you don't host families of dead 7 year olds much. I bet you'd look at the grieving parents and laugh them right out the door. Showcase compassionate conservatism to fellow Americans. Classy üëçüèº. </comment>

<comment>If Gay Barry had something even marginally worthwhile to say, I might listen. Naw, probably not. üòú</comment>

<comment>Obama is selling Guns to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, etc.., while imposing Gun Control at home...Why is he arming Sunni Proxies and imposing Gun Control at the same time??</comment>

<comment>Because he wants a Muslim invasion of the U.S. to impose Sharia Law here so dirty camel jockies can rape your daughters, duh.  That's the answer you have in your head, isn't it.</comment>

<comment>No, he wants massive immigration of low-skill, third-world citizens because it dilutes the power of an already-weak labor force and suppresses wages.  Furthermore, the social turmoil it will cause (cf Germany, Sweden, Belgium, France,) will lead to violent attacks which will in turn make strengthening the surveillance state more politically convenient.The elites are upset that plebs in the West are educated about their rights and relatively independent, as plebs go.  Steps like endorsing mass migrations help the elites to combat that.</comment>

<comment>right....so obama wants to end the world so he can watch us on camera and listen to our phone calls....your theory is spot on, you know everything, you should write a book...id read all 9 pages</comment>

<comment>So what's your explanation for the push to accept the migrant waves?</comment>

<comment>It's a trickle, not a wave, and America has been the greatest engine for assimilating immigrants the world has ever known.I'm all for imprisoning those who flaut our laws for their own profit by employing illegal labour.  Get rid of the demand for illegal labour and the problem of illegal immigration will take care of itself.  But that's not an argument for refusing settlement of refugees.As for the topic of the article:  I'm among those who don't trust the President.  He uses the term "common sense reforms," but he offers nothing that even he or his supporters believe will address the problem they ate ostensibly pushing these "reforms" to solve.  Further, he and his supporters shown scant interest in protecting the civil right to possess firearms or due process.</comment>

<comment>the constitution...the constitution covers all walks of life...even muslims, whether you wanna believe thta or not</comment>

<comment>What in god's name does the US Constitution have to do with Europe accepting millions of migrants?Jesus, for that matter, what does it have to do with the US accepting migrants?  What do you think the Constitution says that's relevant to this, specifically?  Can you quote the relevant part?</comment>

<comment>lol. at least you're honest about it.</comment>

<comment>you mean grieving "Parent" of dead 7 year olds....most of those dead kids don't have daddies, big brother is a gang banger and the family home has at least 3 illegal firearms that Mom knows about...</comment>

<comment>Yeah I keep forgetting your sources keep telling you little  school kids are often the product of broken homes and gang bangers.  Keep keeping bigotry and ignorance going in 2016 friend. </comment>

<comment>Right, the parents of the Connecticut kids were all gang bangers.Idiot.</comment>

<comment>maybe Obama could shed a tear for all of those innocent children killed in the drone strikes he ordered, no? or was that too just the fault of those "crazy gun toting conservatives"?</comment>

<comment>I am not a fan of the NRAs hard-line stance on guns. And I agree that his proposals are reasonable.However his tears were a political prop. The events we was crying over happened 3 long years ago.Second, while it is true that Obama's actions do not stop law abiding citizens from owning a gun, it is equally true that they do very little to prevent the tragedies he is so concerned with.Finally, the idea of making guns safer is plain silly. Guns are weapons. Safe weapons? Seriously? I can see why gun advocates are suspicious. Is the idea here to allow law abiding citizens to own guns that don't shoot? </comment>

<comment>I can't be certain whether or not they were prop or frank.  From personal encounters I do know there are times people simply just show raw emotion when it hits a certain place.Bush cried when meeting with families of 9-11 victims as well as times honoring posthumous ceremonies of American service men and women.  I wont' criticize him or anyone for crying; it's human.I do know this wasn't Obama's first meeting with victims of gun violence.  I'd wager after 7 years of meeting such families and being blunted at every attempt to do something and having to go back and look at those families in the eye saying "there's nothing anyone can do" might take a toll even on the most heartless of us.As for the balance; I'm not sold as to how exactly any such measure put forth - that I've read - would deny any abiding citizen from accruing more guns or even the first one.  Is that in the fine print or is it a projection we tell our selves to believe will happen all of a sudden; who will deny the citizenry?  Congress can only do that and it needs a 2/3rds majority.  And if you know anything about Congress.. they don't make things happen overnight let alone ....ever.As for preventing tragedies?  I actually get his seat belt analogies; they haven't prevented all vehicle accidents or fatalities but comparing post mandatory seat belt laws to pre the numbers are significantly different.  Finally safe guns; yes it's an oxymoronic term. But if I can have my employees laptops & PC's activated only by their respective fingerprints for security reasons.... I'll leave the rest to you.Thanks Bill for having a straight up exchange. Good health to you in 2016.</comment>

<comment>Likewise, always refreshing to have a civil exchange of ideas. Rare unfortunately.I am not sure the seat belt analogy works.  Seat belts are there to prevent people from being killed in car ACCIDENTS. Most people killed by guns are not killed in gun accidents. And none of the mass shootings were accidents. The only way to prevent those incidents from occurring through gun design changes is to render the gun useless for its intended purpose.Now, if the point is to make it easier to somehow identify who the shooter is then that is different. That may help stop some crime as it increases the probability of getting caught. However, most mass shooter's aren't, unfortunately, concerned with getting caught. Part of the allure, it seems, is posthumous notoriety. </comment>

<comment>Firearms manufacturers are 100% unregulated. Please show me another product manufactured in America that enjoys this status. If a firearm malfunctions and injures the user because of a defect, they are out of luck.Why?</comment>

<comment>TOTAL NONSENSE.US Firerarm Manufacturers are required to:- have  Federal license to manufacture- serialize every gun they make- log who each gun was sold to, be it wholesaler, retailer or customer.- the logs need to be available to BATFE inspectors on demandYour claim of: "If a firearm malfunctions and injures the user because of a defect, they are out of luck..",is a flat out lie.Here's one case proving you wronghttp://www.grandviewoutdoors.c...</comment>

<comment>Please show where those requirements have anything to do with meeting any standards in the quality of their product. As far as the Taurus case that is an interesting outcome. However, Taurus is based in Brazil not the U.S. I wonder how that plays into the law on this. I honestly don't know.</comment>

<comment>You really need to get up to speed..1) There is NO restriction on gun manufacturers meeting quality standards on their products. Nor are they free of liability if they sell a defective product2) The Taurus case has NOTHING do to where the product was made, since Taurus USA is the OFFICIAL distributor of the product in the US. And thus fully liable for the product, even though manufactured elsewhere.I will accept that you honestly don't know.I would suggest that you actually read up on why the law protecting gun manufacturers from frivolous lawsuits was needed.Start here:https://www.nraila.org/article...</comment>

<comment>I'll do my homework. But lose the word "ignorant."I am not.</comment>

<comment>Reading up on the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act.Interesting. </comment>

<comment>Is that really a problem? I have never heard of an injury caused by a gun defect.If what you say were true, it is less an argument for regulating guns and more a statement against an over-regulated economy.We have a tort system that is very effective at addressing damages from product defects. Market competition is very effective at punishing companies that have poor product quality.Look at Chipotle Mexican Grill. The had a e-coli issue which made customers sick. Food and restaurants are regulated to death yet still this happened. Chipotle's sales have suffered as a consequence,  their stock has lost 40% of its value, and they are facing lawsuits. Regulations are the same but Chipotle has completely revamped it quality programs to protect its value. </comment>

<comment>Is that really a problem? I have never heard of an injury caused by a gun defect.We'll never know because the NRA has effectively blocked the Feds from collecting such data. But a story is instructive. Some years ago I saw a segment on tv about an older gentleman, an experienced outdoors man who was using a semi automatic rifle that the manufacturer knew had a flaw in it action causing it to fire unintentionally (i.e. without a trigger pull). The man shot off half of his foot. He attempted to sue but was unsuccessful.Regulation is a thorny issue to be sure. But an industry like firearms (which has a rich and interesting history) surely have some oversight. The magic hand of the market and our tort system aren't always enough. E.g. i have family in FL. If you place a loved on in a nursing facility and there were some negligence causing their death you would be unable to sue. The industry has effectively lobbied the state legislature to block such legal action. Kinda mind boggling.NOTE: Sprinfield Armory is a great American company. During the Industrial Revolution they developed mass production techniques that matched the quality of hand crated firearms. The British were amazed by this. A delegation came to Springfield and went to school. The result? The Royal Small Arms Factory began mass producing some legendary firearms.It was revolutionary ;  )</comment>

<comment>Absolute nonsense propaganda.1) The NRA has not blocked ANY research. Nor does it have the power to block the Feds from anything.Just for the record, Congress bitch-slapped the CDC for publishing blatant gun-control propaganda masquerading as "research". And effectively told the CDC, they won't get any more money to do so.2) There is NO law restricting people from suing a gun manufacturer for selling a defective product and causing harm. This is another of those ignorant gun control propaganda memes.I doubt that your claim about that lawsuit is factual.I would suggest that you do a bit more research, so that you can avoid spouting ignorant cant in the future.</comment>

<comment>More ignorant cant ;  )The NRA and CDC.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Who decides where the money goes ? The Congress ?Or the President with Executive orders ?You need to use better sources than WapooAnd just a reminder the "D" in CDC stands for "Disease"Since when are guns a "disease" ?This is nothing but gun controllers trying to do an end-run around the 2nd Amendment by declaring "gun violence" a medical issue.And there are a lot of people stupid enough to buy into that</comment>

<comment>Just a general article on the CDC flap.</comment>

<comment>Too bad it's more propaganda than fact.</comment>

<comment>Just a jumping off point.</comment>

<comment>In the mid-1990's, congress was asked to fund a CDC investigation into gun violence by the Clinton administration, who were well-known for theiranti-gun-rights agenda.Dr. Mark Rosenberg, who was then director of the National Center for InjuryPrevention and Control at the CDC, explained his aim was to make thepublic see firearms as ‚Äúdirty, deadly‚Äîand banned.‚Äù (Quoted in William Raspberry, ‚ÄúSick People With Guns,‚Äù The Washington Post, Oct. 19, 1994.)A newspaper article on two other leading anti-gun propagandists, Dr.Katherine Christoffel and Dr. Robert Tanz of the Children‚Äôs Hospital inChicago, explained their ‚Äúplan to do to handguns what their profession has done to cigarettes ‚Ä¶ turn gun ownership from a personal-choice issue to a repulsive, anti-social health hazard.‚Äù (Harold Henderson, ‚ÄúPolicy: Guns ‚Äòn Poses,‚Äù Chicago Reader, Dec. 16, 1994.)The NRA went to congress with these quotes (and others) and said 'It sounds to us like the CDC has reached their conclusions before they've even began their research. Is that something the US Taxpayer should be funding?'Congress agreed, and cut off the funding.The CDC had no one but themselves to blame.</comment>

<comment>Thanks. Will keep digging.</comment>

<comment>"The CDC had no one but themselves to blame." That sounds about right. But now we have very, very little information because it is such a hot button issue. I'm a pragmatic "follow the facts wherever they lead" kinda guy. And what little statistical data we get is skewed for advocacy purposes. The recent numbers on mass shootings and the debunking comes to mind. We can and should do better, but, I just don't know. DC gonna be DC.</comment>

<comment>There is a lot of data available.  Much is, as you say, subject to being skewed for advocacy purposes.  That is why I much prefer the government issued studies, and some from academia.As for the government, the CDC published a paper for Mr. Obama in 2013.  It was promptly swept under the rug, because it didn't support the narrative the administration was pushing.http://www.nap.edu/catalog/183...You can download the study here for free.Here is another study issued by the Department of Justice.http://bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf...Here is one that is a little dated, but it shows where criminals get the most weapons.  It isn't from gun shows, and very few from legal sources.http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub...So, like I said, there is a lot of information out there.  Those who would ignore the right to arms simply ignore the studies I have provided to you.  Have a very nice evening.</comment>

<comment>Thanks. Always looking for good data. But "Those who would ignore the right to arms" doesn't include me. I am a pragmatist who wants to follow the facts wherever they lead. Sadly, it seems there are few on any side of this issue. But as a wise man said, follow the money.</comment>

<comment>I'd certainly like to see the NRA play a bigger role in helping to reduce gun violence. However, I think you are wrong in blaming them for the lack of data on this. </comment>

<comment>No, look up Remington 700 lawsuits.  Individual and class action both exist and have settlements.</comment>

<comment>Thnx. Will look it up.</comment>

<comment>I have a sneaking suspicion that the incident i brought initially up was a Remington 700. Mea culpa.</comment>

<comment>Those tears were fake as a supermodel's tits.</comment>

<comment>LOL. Gotta admit I'll take the latter any day if I had the chance... fake or real :)</comment>

<comment>Haha of course. I would probably take almost ANYTHING other than Barry's fake speeches anyday though lol.</comment>

<comment>That's very cute and all. But considering what any President sees in their Daily Briefing, both foreign and domestic, I do not envy them. Not to mention the choices like "who do I drone today and how many civilians will I kill?".If the deaths of the children and teachers in Newtown CT moves him him to tears, if that's his breaking point, who are we to question it?</comment>

<comment>It's not that I don't believe that could move someone to tears. It's obvious if you watch that speech that the tears were fake.</comment>

<comment>Vapid, meet stupid.</comment>

<comment>It must really suck being stuck in a cognitive vacuum. Drink!</comment>

<comment>The strongest men show emotion of all kinds openly in public.  The strongest men also understand the reasons for the need to change outdated rules and regulations, and adhere to them.</comment>

<comment>Criminals prefer using the Black Market.  Why would a Criminal volunteer for a Background Check and fail on purpose??</comment>

<comment>Read comment above.</comment>

<comment>So you don't lock your doors because criminals have lock picks?</comment>

<comment>But prosecutions for violations of various gun control measures already on the books are down a reported some 40% under the Obama Administration.If one is already not enforcing existing laws then what good are more laws to be unenforced going to do?Plus, none of the Presidents proposed measures would have prevented the very acts he says we need to measures to prevent......which makes little sense.</comment>

<comment>"If one is already not enforcing existing laws then what good are more laws to be unenforced going to do?"The two biggest elements in the EOs pertained to adding resources at the FBI and ATF to increase enforcement.  Why oppose that?"[N]one of the Presidents proposed measures would have prevented the very acts he says we need to measures to prevent"Actually, Dylan Roof's background check application was one of those that were "approved" without review due to a lack of staff.  As the law stands now, if the check isn't completed within 3 days, the gun sale is permitted.  Again, why oppose measures that might fix such flaws?My apologies in advance, if we were not supposed to be discussing this issue using facts.</comment>

<comment>Who is "opposing" it?I just pointed out that the laws we already have are not being enforced.More laws that are not being enforced don't really help.And again, it could have been done at any time in the last 7 years.More money for mental health care is IMO a really good idea BTW.The Dylan Roof thing--Again,  the lack of staff--if that was the problem, could have been dealt with any time in the last 7 years.No need to say your sorry, I have come to expect people not actually reading my posts before offering tepid spin in response.</comment>

<comment>One needs funding for mental health as well as employ staff to review gun applications.Congress, not the WH, manages the purse strings.  For +7 years neither the D or R folk (as a whole) in Congress have yet to lift a finger to fund either of the above let alone appropriate funds to enforce existing laws.You can bark at the POTUS all day but it's Congress that's the root cause and road block to 99.999% of what can be done to make things somewhat better.</comment>

<comment>If funding is the issue than what good are his executive measures? Presumably they require funding as well.If funding is the issue then why did the President not ask for more money back in 2008 when he had a veto proof majority? If his own party would not support him then why yell at his opposition now?And where precisely is the Presidents explict demand for more money so he can enforce existing laws on gun control?He has enough money to take lavish vacations....perhaps he could have played a bit less golf and used the savings to help save lives? Newsmax Jan 4th 2013 says his 4 vacations to Hawaii cost, on the low side, $20 million dollars.....you can hire a lot of people for $20 million dollars.He has plenty of money to sue the Little Sisters of the Poor over birth control, he has enough money to defend Muslim truck drivers who don't want to deliver beer.Sorry for the sarcasm but the notion that funding is the issue brings it out in me.BTW, I'm less "barking at the President" and more highlighting the problem/s with him "barking" at everyone else.</comment>

<comment>fair points; he could've pushed harder perhaps or focused harder on redirecting/re-prioritizing budgets.</comment>

<comment>Remember, this is a guy, folks, that told you if you like your doctor and your health plan, you get to keep it.  This is a guy who told you if you like your plan, no sweat, when Obamacare hits you can keep your plan, you can keep your doctor.  Furthermore, your premiums are gonna go down $2,500.  Same guy who told you that told everybody this week,  "No, no, no, no, I don't want to get guns off the streets, out of people's hands, that's not what I'm aiming for here."It certainly is.</comment>

<comment>I don't recall him saying that. And your PPACA rant has nothing to do with this.If your neighbor asks, "I'd like to build a hedge fence on our property line," do you assume he's building Alcatraz?</comment>

<comment>Depends on what your neighbor has said about it over the years and if they actually have the ability to do it.If he belongs to a group that has been trying to build "Alcatraz" for decades, that has written a plethora of articles about it, made speeches about it, etc etc.And has the ability, power, and authority to try and make it happen.....you might want to give his statements some serious thought.The more so if your neighbor has a history of making statements that prove un-trustworthy.Bitter clingers to their guns and bibles, the ACA is not a tax, you can keep your doctor, red lines in Syria over chemical weapons, etc etc.So when they assure you they are not building "Alcatraz" you might want to take that with a really big grain of salt.</comment>

<comment>background checks on people buying guns is a bad thing why?just fucking explain why its such a bad idea..pleasebecause its obama's plan? thats your reasoning?</comment>

<comment>Who says it is?Background checks, except in a few areas, are already the current norm.Should we close the gun show loophole? Sure.Would that have prevented the very shootings the President used to say we need to enact his measures? No.Can you have an actual discussion about the issue without the Straw men and miss-framing?</comment>

<comment>Obama is selling Guns to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, etc.., while imposing Gun Control at home.Why is he arming Sunni Proxies and imposing Gun Control at the same time??</comment>

<comment>Hey, you already asked this exact same question.  Obsess much?</comment>

<comment>because those countries govts are fighting rebel armies who are actively taking over their countries..if obama just allowed those things to happen, youd complain how he let egypt fall or how he let isis take over syria..etc</comment>

<comment>No I would not complain about him choosing sides and sponsoring Sunni proxies like ISIL.What is Hillary's position regarding ME arm sales and endless war??</comment>

<comment>And the same man who snobbishly belittled gun owners on the campaign trail and fawned over the gun laws of a totalitarian state.</comment>

<comment>The NRA says they were to be allowed only a single, pre-screened question.Besides, the "cowardly" part is a President who could have acted anytime in the last 7 years, including a short period where he had a veto proof majority in Congress. And did......nothing.Until he was leaving office of course.Either he really does not believe his current measures will save lives......if he did look at the people he allowed to die over the last 7 YEARS.Or he knows his measures will accomplish little but he still did not want to risk any political fall out until he was nearly out of office.Either way does not speak well of the man or his measures.</comment>

<comment>The link says the town hall was organized by CNN and groups from both sides would be invited. Where does it say the NRA would be limited to one pre screened question? </comment>

<comment>That is what one of the NRA spokesmen said last night on one of the TV shows.Maybe its true maybe its not.I doubt CNN is telling people it pre-screened the questions.I am willing to consider it as it would not be the 1st time the pre-screening thing has come up.In any case before the refusal to participate is labeled "cowardly" perhaps their reasoning should be checked out/considered.</comment>

<comment>thanks</comment>

<comment>Questions were pre-screened, but some questioners changed them on the spot.Surely, the NRA's talking points weren't much different than other pro-gun questions last night? (small town Sheriff, rape survivor, CA gun range VP etc.)It is indeed cowardly. An invitation to question the president on live national TV was refused. They've also refused to meet with him on other occasions.In absence of substantive concerns, this is what happens: people refuse to exercise 1st amendment rights in protest. How ironic.</comment>

<comment>Wonder how many of the Obama haters even bothered to watch it, Paddy...</comment>

<comment>Not many, probably a few. They likely settled for sound bites and edited video clips from other media "outlets".</comment>

<comment>Maybe, maybe not....we really don't know that do we.They were willing to allow their question to be pre-screened, the NRA wasn't. Some reporters refuse to do the same. Some don't.Nope, its simply unwillingness to play a game by the opponents rules.Huh? They didn't refuse to exercise their 1st Amendment rights, they just declined to use them in that particular venue.And in any case what is "cowardly" to me is that if the President really felt his measures would save lives then why did he allow all those people to die over the last 7 years before using executive orders?He even had a veto proof majority for a short while, could have done literally anything he wanted in terms of legal actions of his office.</comment>

<comment>Which is it? Because your reply makes no sense unless you differentiate.All the NRA had to do was grab a mic and ask any question. That's not kowtowing to the opponent, the event was CNN's.They weren't walking into the lion's den, just a polite debate. No excuses for not speaking up, since they are so vocal when they don't have to look opponents in the eye.I agree it's late, but there's no blood on his hands. He's never been the one advocating for less restriction. He was eager to sign Manchin-Toomey. It's Congress' responsibility, and they have done nothing. A little too late is better than nothing at all.</comment>

<comment>I 'm simply saying that we really don't know if anybody "changed their questions" from the pre-screened ones to others.And in any case that's its possible to break the rules is still no reason for the NRA to participate.....unless you are advocating that people should lie and break the rules.Why ask for pre-screened question in the first place if the President is so willing to "look the opponent in the eye?"For that matter why go on a friendly network like CNN instead of an one not so friendly like Fox News if the President is so manly and brave? ;)Of course there is "blood on his hands" IF he really believes that his measures will save lives then NOT using executive orders--just like he plans on doing now--allowed people to die.</comment>

<comment>After town hall, Anderson Cooper stated: "Some people changed their questions." See the after show commentary.And no, I'm not advocating for breaking the rules, straw man.What damning question did the NRA have ready which would have sunk the president's pitch? Would anything they have be so outrageous that it couldn't be aired on live TV?He admits these changes will do little. But they might do something. In which case, I would ask back: why weren't these changes recommended to the president in lieu of formal regulation from Congress?</comment>

<comment>Ok so your saying that since "some people" changed their question the NRA should have lied about their single question then showed up and asked something entirely different?Again, is not a question of what question they would have asked, as per them, they objected to being able to ask only a single question that must be pre-screened. As do many reporters.If the measures would not stop the very acts he is using to say his measures were needed then what is the point?Besides, I support more money for mental health care, and more LEOS' are seldom a bad idea.And it matters little what Congress did or did not do. The President had the ability to take the SAME executive orders actions at any time in the last 7 YEARS......he had a veto proof majority for a time back in in his first term.The conclusion is inescapable, he either sat around and let people die or he really does not think his measures will help.Say I have a means to save peoples lives--BUT I refuse to take action because "somebody else" needs to do it. So I just sat around and watch people die year after year after year after year after year after year after year, before I do it?</comment>

<comment>NO. I never said that. You said "maybe, maybe not...we don't know". Questions were pre-screened, but some people deviated. You can't say "I don't know what happened, but here's a reason". An argument in absence of facts is just reckless opinion.I'm not suggesting that's lying or deception. Everyone got 1 question. Why should the NRA monopolize the hour? Others asked similar questions, anyway. What was NRA dying to ask which they refused to ask in public?The president didn't sit around. Congress can only start the Federal lawmaking process. EOs are a law clarification.Whether there's blood on his hands is counterfactual history and "what if". Whether it was always up to him to use the last straw facing incredible obstruction, reeks of dishonesty. At present, this is all he can do.</comment>

<comment>I conceded that point, I didn't know that Cooper had said some people had changed their questions.I just don't see the importance that people did so UNLESS you are saying that the NRA should have done it to.....it seems a bit of technicality, as in non-substantive. Are you or are you not saying the NRA should have lied about the question they wished to ask then change it up on the fly?Again, the NRA--as per them-- refuse to participate due to having only  a single pre-screened question. As do many reporters. They seemingly wanted to have more of a discussion and did not wish to use pre-screened questions.The President clearly did not want to have a serious discussion or debate on the issue, it was simply a venue to get his talking points out. On a "friendly network, with a "friendly" person running it, and answering pre-screened questions that he had already seen and had the answers prepared for.The NRA said "no thanks" as is their right to do.Yes, the President clearly did. He can and could have issued the same executive orders at any time.Nope, not a "counterfactual" at all. Least not on my end. The President says these measures will save lives. He could have taken them at any time in the last 7 years. So if the measures will save lives and he didn't take action sooner then by his own logic his failure to act got people killed......that is on him.</comment>

<comment>A town hall meeting, to which the town was not invited, is hardly indicative of anything.</comment>

<comment>And none of that will change a thing with the wingnuts.</comment>

<comment>Yes they do inhibit law abiding individuals' rights.  Large numbers of 2nd Amendment supporters own more than four firearms and when they get old or die, their collections must be inherited, bequeathed, gifted or sold.  That means estates become dealers and background checks will be required for mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, uncles, cousins, friends, and neighbors.  Although that's what this charlatan wants, it would seem the President of the United States would have something better to do.  As a suggestion, perhaps he should do something about the 5,639 murders committed by illegal aliens every year.  This action is absurd because is solves no problem at all.</comment>

<comment>Collections could be bequeathed through an FFL dealer. Not a big deal, they are lethal instruments. Wouldn't want a crazed son, daughter or heir to get their hands on guns without a background check.Yawn, illegal aliens. Vote Trump, I guess.</comment>

<comment>It ain't up to you.</comment>

<comment>That's Obama employing Alinskyite tactics: personalize one's opponents and demonize them. Obama would never dare demonizing millions of law-abiding gun owners, many of whom are Democrats, so he makes up stuff about the NRA and demonizes it.  How courageous is that? Why doesn't Obama and his loyal follower Paddy_O_Door call on those millions of law-abiding gun owners to change their minds? How great is Obama at actual political persuasion. It's easy to advocate harsh gun laws as someone who won't have to face the voters again, particularly with the courageous backing of the New York Times.</comment>

<comment>Change their minds about what?If they're law abiding, they'll abide by these orders.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it all comes down to the government's use of coercive force in the end, doesn't it?  Of course if the government is acting lawfully, it will have to have a democratic majority, won't it?  Or does "saving lives" outweigh that detail? I suppose you've swallowed all those polls generated by the Anti-Gun Lobby for the last fifty years claiming to show how everyone and his dog support gun control?</comment>

<comment>Sir, are Executive Orders legal or not?If legal and Constitutional, law-abiding people must follow them. If there is a problem, take it up in court.Left with no other option to save lives, the president is left to clarify existing law. That is all he can do, nothing more.Congress is the only authority which can pass new, expansive gun policy. That isn't likely at present. Got it?</comment>

<comment>He's probably doing those candidates a favor.</comment>

<comment>Democratic candidates are breathing sighs of relief.</comment>

<comment>Obama made that joke too easy for you. :-)</comment>

<comment>He's only going to campaign for fellow gays.</comment>

<comment>"President Butt Naked"</comment>

<comment>Or Butt Head.</comment>

<comment>Theories abound as to what Obama was doing yesterday at the pep rally on gun control.  The first thing he was doing was attacking the Constitution.  Make no mistake.  I sit here and I have an objective -- I've had it for a long time -- and that is to educate as many people as possible about liberalism and how it operates, how to recognize it, what it is.  It's an ongoing thing; it will never end. It's an ongoing educational process, and then after people learn it, there's something about socialism that just attracts people.</comment>

<comment>Obama is just saying nonsensical things about guns.  I mean, he admits on one hand that everything he's talking about here is not going to stop any of the events that have taken place with guns, like the San Bernardino massacre and that.  Then on the other hand he says but even if we just stop one act of violence, it's worth what we're doing here.  And then he's going on and on, "I don't understand why anybody would oppose what I'm trying to do.  We're not trying to take guns out of the hands of people.  We're just trying to make it harder and harder for people who have criminal intent to get guns."  How do you know?The fact of the matter is that gun control is such a mandatory issue if you're a liberal Democrat, you have to have this particular point of view on it, and the point of view is that you've got to get rid of guns.  The point of view is that it is not who uses the gun that's the problem; the gun is the problem, the ammunition is the problem and you've gotta get rid of it.  And he stands up there and acts like people would be crazy to think he really wants to take away people's guns.  People are not crazy.  We have listened to liberals all of our lives.  We know exactly what they want to do.</comment>

<comment>I heard the same anti-gun rhetoric in three different countries, it's always the same.</comment>

<comment>"How do you know?"Please tell me you see the irony in that?</comment>

<comment>He's not saying nonsensical things. he's the Griever in Chief, and he's from Chicago. And yes, he's a Democrat who's lived in metropolises his entire adult life.But I imagine meeting with the Sandy Hook families, looking those parents in the eye, and crying with them has a profound effect.I suspect if you've met with all the survivors he has, you'd be inclined to understand him as a human being...</comment>

<comment>‚Äúcampaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform.‚Äù=========That means he backs Hillary. BTW, how funny is it that the NRA was too frightened to attend an open discussion on guns? If they can't control the narrative 100%, they won't leave NRA HQ.</comment>

<comment>They say they were only allowed a single, pre-screed, question. Might be less fear and more concern over deck stacking.Which Democrat for POTUS is against gun control?For that matter Democrat period is running on an anti-gun control platform?</comment>

<comment>O'Malley is definitely for gun control, but he isn't really in the running. Hillary is in line with O'Malley. Bernie, on the other hand, is waffling on guns.</comment>

<comment>So that really leaves nobody on the POTUS side he will not be campaigning for.So what is the point of the statement then?</comment>

<comment>and that fear appears to be well founded.  This was a "town hall meeting" to which the town was not invited. If the President is so sure about how "reasonable" his actions are, and he is certain of his moral authority,  then why the need to avoid facing the very people he is trying to regulate?</comment>

<comment>"[W]hy the need to avoid facing the very people he is trying to regulate?"It's basically the other way around.  NRA has declined a few invitations to discuss the issues at the White House.  They won't come to the table for discussions.  Perhaps you can explain why?  It's not like the 2nd Amendment has no limitations - Heller made that abundantly clear.</comment>

<comment>This event was nothing more than a staged publicity piece. It's interesting that you argue that the NRA declined the invitation but IGNORE the fact that the event was CLOSED to the public.  This is significant because there are a lot of gun owners in Virginia (where the venue is located.)  President Obama made a big deal about the NRA "not showing up" for his PR puff piece.  What he DID NOT say is that the event was closed to the very people (the gun owners in Virginia...among others) that he was proposing to regulate.  If his moral authority is so clear then he should have no problem facing unscripted questions from the general public.</comment>

<comment>Like all events of this type, most of the audience was "by invitation."  That's how they work.  The last time a presidential event was open to "the public" it was the inauguration.  That's a lot of bodies to cram in the room.I don't make a big deal out of the NRA's refusal to attend.  Nevertheless, I do find their continued unwillingness to accept engagement to be curious.  And, that's as someone who doesn't really think that much regulation in the area is necessary.As a supporter of the gun lobby, wouldn't you like to see them at least openly get in the debate?</comment>

<comment>Yes I would like to openly get in the debate.  I'm not a member of the NRA.I understand why they would DECLINE to attend a puff piece PR function that was NEVER intended to include dialogue on this matter.</comment>

<comment>But, they've also declined to participate when invited to more substantive events/meetings   It's not surprising, they're safer hiding in the shadows and avoiding the truths that emerge in the light.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense..They're smart enough to pick and choose their battles.Meanwhile your claim of "avoiding the truths that emerge in the light" is just unsubstantiated nonsense as well.But hey, I'm willing to playGive us at least 5 "truths that emerge in the light".I'm willing to bet, you have nothing substantive. Even outright lies.</comment>

<comment>Truths always emerge in light.  That's why they don't want to leave the shadows.  Thing is, only they know what lies they're telling.  The problem is, that they won't be subjected to scrutiny.Maybe, I'm wrong.  Perhaps, the NRA is the first lobbying group in US history that never deceives, huh?</comment>

<comment>And what "truths" would those be?  I saw a LIE propagated during the Presidential Puff Piece:  You know, the one about internet saies?</comment>

<comment>Can't say I'm an expert on all Internet transactions.  What was the "lie" and where can I find a factually supported refutation?</comment>

<comment>That most internet sales aren't subject to regulations regarding interstate sales and use of FFLs.</comment>

<comment>False.Under Federal LawAll handguns sales across state lines must go through an FFLLocal and adjacent State sales of long guns are allowed, But everything else requires an FFL.Eg Wi to Wi or Mn to WI. is OK without FFL, But not Mn to Il, because they are not adjacentUnder State law, there may be more restrictions, like needing a permit to purchase by the State.</comment>

<comment>The NRA is ALREADY in the game..And they're very successful at it.The NRA is SMART to get into a game that is fixed from the start.And that is EXACTLY what attending that Obama even wasA "fixed" event.Think of a pro golfer at the peak of his game who can pick and choose where to appear.And then some idiot coming along and setting up a tournament where the top players are required to play with one hand behind their backs.He'd be stupid to attend.And the idiots who fault him for not attending such a rigged event are just that .Idiots.</comment>

<comment>The NRA just threw down the gauntlet to Obamahttp://townhall.com/tipsheet/k...</comment>

<comment>Such an offer must be making the President salivate.  LaPierre's not particularly bright and sometimes struggles to speak coherently in public fora.Although, such a stunt would establish a horrible political precedent -  a sitting president to engaging a lobbyist like that.  It might have to wait for late January 2017.</comment>

<comment>LOLBetter go do a web search for "obama failed prompter" to see him make an ass of himself.And I'm willing to bet you've never seen LaPierre on any "public fora"Hell,I'm willing to bet that LaPierre is order of magnitudes smarter than Obama.And if we go by the success of the NRA compared to the 7 years of failure of Obama, that's pretty self-evidentObama will just hide.He doesn't have the courage of his convictionsThat's why he needs to set up show piece events where the audience and questions asked are strictly controlled, and the answers are well-rehearsed.</comment>

<comment>The NRA wisely declined to be present as a captive audience for Obama's staged propaganda play.Sometimes it's wiser NOT to pick up the gauntlet, no matter what the marching morons may spout as a response.A closed venue with hand-picked guests is not much different from those staged trials that were so popular in the Soviet and other socialist heavens.At least Che had the honesty to come out and state, that trials were a redundant waste of time, because he really didn't care about  putting on a show.</comment>

<comment>So, they feared yet another thing? No surprises there - given the paranoia endemic amongst the leadership.</comment>

<comment>WhateverRational thought in this one absent is.</comment>

<comment>Good question.I'm also troubled by the pre-screening thing as well.Its not really even an honest Q&A if the President gets all the questions in advance.</comment>

<comment>Here's the NRA's reply to that fake "town hall meeting"http://townhall.com/tipsheet/k...</comment>

<comment>President Obama won't agree to this debate.</comment>

<comment>Obama would have no hope and no chance when facing the truth.</comment>

<comment>That's truly funny accusing the NRA of controlling the narrative 100%, when that is EXACTLY what Obama did with his fake "town hall meeting"Restricted access by invitation only with pre-screened questions.-----The NRA just threw down the gauntlet to Obama about doing a fair debate instead of a managed show..http://townhall.com/tipsheet/k...Let's see if Obambi has cojones.(Maybe he can borrow Michele's)\</comment>

<comment>In fact, the NRA would never engage in a debate that they can't control 100%. If they attended Obama's town hall meeting, they would be asked about the 33,000+ dead from gun violence every single year and why NRA leadership isn't acting in the interest of 3/4 of their members who support universal background checks. They can't spin that in front of a live audience.</comment>

<comment>Your claims are false based on playing word games.Run and hide in denialYour Obambi will be hiding with you.</comment>

<comment>Obama kicked off the gun safety debate and Hillary will be implementing major changes in her two terms. Start dealing with that reality instead of growling and barking every time someone speaks the truth about guns in America.</comment>

<comment>The ONLY way, Hillary will be back in the White House will be with a Visitor Pass.You are going to have such a major letdown in November.We'll probably have to call a suicide watch on you.</comment>

<comment>247 electoral votes + Florida or Ohio or a couple of swing states = President Hillary Clinton. The GOP nominee will have to sweep all the battleground states and even take a blue state for good measure. I guarantee that this will not happen - not with this terrible GOP field and a DEEPLY divided party on the verge of civil war. The Republicans lost this race for the White House several years ago.</comment>

<comment>You must have seriously over-indulged in your youth.You still haven't come down from that "trip".</comment>

<comment>The GOP can't win given the current electoral college voting trend. They'd need another Reagan style sweep. You know its true. Stop fighting the reality of the situation, Attila.</comment>

<comment>You're so disconnected from reality, that one would be better off doing so from Adam Lanza</comment>

<comment>Is Obama an asset or a liability to a Democratic candidate ? My impression is that people are tired of him; what is his approval ratings ?</comment>

<comment>His approval ratings are in the mid-40s lately.  Which basically means if he were eligible to run again, he'd probably even increase his margin of victory over the 2012 totals.  The Dems lesson from 2014 was not getting the President out and aggressively "selling" their agenda cost them a lot.</comment>

<comment>Plus 40 percent in last year of second presidency is pretty good</comment>

<comment>Everything that liberals do is political.Like gun control.  It's not about compassion.  It's not about saving lives.  And that's why the tears are phony.  It's not about any of that.  It's all about amassing and accruing and cementing more power for people in the Democrat Party at the highest levels of government.  That's the purpose of liberalism and socialism as far as they're concerned, and so nothing's real.  Everything is spin.</comment>

<comment>Funny, I think the same thing about conservatives. I guess we're at an impasse.And as such, since we can't even have a civil conversation with one another anymore, perhaps we need a political divorce.By all means, go found your own country. I won't argue. It's been so much fun all these years having to work with you people, but I guess it just isn't working out. Goodbye!</comment>

<comment>You liberals are free to go to Cuba, North Korea, Iran or some other hell-hole to your liking.   You are the ones who have turned your backs to America.</comment>

<comment>"Everything that liberals do is political."Cool, more silly, ironic posts from you.</comment>

<comment>If Obama really believes guns are so bad he should disarm the secret service.  Otherwise he's just a hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>No, no, see those guns and the highly trained and expensive people that protect him and his family 24/7 are needed to protect him and his family.You and your family are not nearly as important and you certainly can't afford 24/7 protection from the some the best trained people in the world.As such you really shouldn't be able to get or have a gun to protect yourself.World is probably better off without more "bitter clingers" who probably don't even vacation in Martha's Vineyard.Man I really need a "sarcasm" emoji here.</comment>

<comment>Stupid, nonsensical, unoriginal talking point.You do know that Reagan was a hell of a lot more aggressive about gun control than this president has been, right?</comment>

<comment>Except, the President isn't taking anyone's guns.   Therefore, there is nothing hypocritical about it.</comment>

<comment>"the president called for a ban on gun purchases by suspected terrorists on the TSA‚Äôs No-Fly List."Sadly, this shows the shameless and total disregard that Obama and company have for a constitutional right.This is basically the action of barring citizens from exercising their   constitutional right on the grounds of an arbitrary and secret list bypassing any kind of due process.</comment>

<comment>Annoying thing is you have anti-gun papers like the NYDNs attacking anyone who criticizes that proposal as "supporting terrorists" while running stories about how a 6 year old is on the list just for having a name vaguely similar to an ISIS figure in the same paper.</comment>

<comment>Come on! This from a guy who couldn't leave White House grounds in a 1963 split window Corvette Stingray with Jerry Seinfeld because he is protected by an armed guard at the gate. The are more guns and the homicide rate has been on the decline. He has been calling for gun control with nothing specific and leaving things up to Congress so it seems like he is doing something.I like President Obama and believe his heart, for the most part, is in the right place, but mass shootings still remain a rounding error in the number of homicides and more murders are committed by blunt objects or by hands and feet than by all rifles including the AR-15 and AK-47. https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/c...I would agree with this Washington Post article https://www.washingtonpost.com... that we might think to raise the age limit to purchase and possess a gun simply because of the research into the development of the prefrontal cortex. I believe this would make a significant difference.However, I would also favor delaying entry into our military service until such an age as well for the very same reason.</comment>

<comment>"However, I would also favor delaying entry into our military service until such an age as well for the very same reason."Wow, that is eerie.  I was thinking this same thing while reading your post.  As a vet who is now older and wiser, I agree wholeheartedly...</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your service.</comment>

<comment>Along with registration and background checks, there must be mandatory training. No one who does not understand how to handle and store a firearm properly, and does not prove that they can and will do so, should own one.Getting small firearms off the streets is another matter altogether. That is a problem of the black market, and must be tackled at that level. Gun control can only do so much to lessen the problem of criminals and those with troubled minds obtaining weapons with the intention to use them for criminal purposes.Corruption in the system that allows criminals to acquire weapons must be tackled directly and mercilessly. There should be no corrupted or troubled mind on any side of the law that evades the radar. That includes anyone with an interest in gun, gang, or criminal culture or action of any kind. All such troubled minds must receive help, education or other direct intervention as early as possible.All of this would require the system to adhere to an extremely strict code of conduct. That means the appropriate re-training and oversight of all with the power to intervene in the lives of individuals and their families.The issue is not so simple as whether or not one should have the right to bear arms. The stable-minded and competent should have that right. The problem is systemic, and demands an overhaul, as the issue lies with corruption, lack of education and ignorance at all levels.</comment>

<comment>Obama is selling Guns to Saudi Arabia, Turkey, etc.., while imposing Gun Control at home.Why is he arming Sunni Proxies and imposing Gun Control at the same time??</comment>

<comment>Presuming he will not be supporting Republicans candidates, being a Democrat and all.What exactly does the President mean when he says he will not campaign for anyone that does not support gun control?Is any Democrat running for POTUS not supporting gun control?Is any Democrat period running on an anti-gun control platform?Besides he has said all sorts of things--the ACA is not a tax,  that you could keep your doctor, running up debt is unpatriotic, red lines on chemical weapons in Syria, etc etc......including speaking out against the very executive orders he now is saying he is going to use......so why believe him now?</comment>

<comment>Bernie isn't committing to gun control.</comment>

<comment>Maybe, but he is essentially a dead man walking in terms of voter support vs Hillary right now.And that is just 1 guy that the President "may" not support.</comment>

<comment>That will cause problems for some rural Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Not a good showing for the President there.  To me it looked like he was surprised at the opposition he received and dealt with it rather badly.</comment>

<comment>If he chose to enforce immigration laws and ended illegal sanctuary cities, that alone would save many Americans lives. Nothing mentioned about that. </comment>

<comment>How many lives do you think this would save?</comment>

<comment>Thanks for nothing Keith.  He's so toxic that the pathetic homophobic, xenophobic, dysfunctional, gun-stroking, bible-banging cretins that infest the Republican party couldn't defeat him two times.You are a useless sot.</comment>

<comment>What a load of B.S. Every candidate knows that having the Great One at his side is the kiss of death this campaign year. Barry knows it, too. So by making such a silly declaration he thinks he appears resolute, when the reality is that he's constructing an excuse to not campaign -- with candidates who don't want him anyway.</comment>

<comment>An NRA spokesman told CNN they saw, ‚Äúno reason to participate in a public relations spectacle orchestrated by the White House".What a chickenshit response!</comment>

<comment>Considering they were told they get a prescreened question with NO rebuttal..why would you show up to a "dog and pony" show?</comment>

<comment>Is that the NRA narrative?Nah, the NRA chickened out... no caljones, capeesh?</comment>

<comment>feel free to believe your fantasy...if you think all those "random" people showed up to ask "random" questions..like Mark Kelly "happened " to be there and obama "happened" to "randomly" call on him...go ahead...</comment>

<comment>I'm sure that there was some structure to the event, as there always is in such cases; the NRA could have negotiated a set of rules that each side would abide by, but no, they boycotted and condemned the whole  thing.The NRA owns Cruz and Rubio, but the American People want common sense gun legislation, the Republican Party is on the losing side of this debate.</comment>

<comment>https://dl.dropboxusercontent....</comment>

<comment>By the NRA not showing up it shows you what cowards they are. They hide behind the gun and encourage others to do the same with no thought of the possible carnage some who hang onto the NRA's every word may go out and commit.</comment>

<comment>First Obama would have to find any candidates who even want his support. The election when the GOP took back the Senate, Democrats were running away from Obama.Obama is living inside his own echo chamber which in the final year of his tenure is understandable. Presidents do become more and more isolated. Trump, of course, has spent his entire life isolated in his own echo chamber - -  imagine what he will be like if, lord help us, got elected?</comment>

<comment>Trump will find a way to bail out, if it looks like he might actually have a shot; this is all one big publicity stunt for this bombastic egotist.  The man has no intention of becoming president, this is about Trump's revenge on the Republican Party and Trump's flagrant narcissism.</comment>

<comment>Wow, in that town hall last night Taya Kyle really made Obama look the fool. Reduced him to a stuttering mess.</comment>

<comment>You mean when she had that wardrobe malfunction?</comment>

<comment>she had to "make" him?</comment>

<comment>The NRA is our very own extremist organization. Which is why Bush 41 turned in his membership.</comment>

<comment>NRA = Nuts, Rednecks & A-holes.</comment>

<comment>I met some very decent people when I attended an NRA gunsmithing school but we weren't allowed to have ammo anywhere in the classroom or on the campus. We couldn't even have it locked in the trunk of our vehicles. But they'd like to see guns on the campus of every other college.</comment>

<comment>and which candidate is actually asking for Obama's endorsement?</comment>

<comment>His approval rating hangs around 50%.  That means half the country likes him just fine.  It also means he still carries influence with democrats.  Your snarky comment isn't grounded in reality.</comment>

<comment>He's personally coming door to door to take everyone's guns.He must've gotten Santa technology I guess; you know, magically appear door to door, and take everyone's guns away right then and there.

<comment>Look, people who worry about confiscation aren't stupid. If you think seriously about firearm statistics and the details of laws proposed that aren't confiscation (i.e. background checks, etc.), you realize very quickly that the only way for gun control advocates to actually get the results they say they want is confiscation. So let's be realistic. We can tinker at edges, which is absolutely worthwhile, but if you think that gun control advocates want maximal results, then you have no choice but to conclude that they will arrive at confiscation. Period.</comment>

<comment>President Obama won't take away the precious guns but I most certainly would if I had the power to do it. That's the only way to stop the insane obsession with guns in this country</comment>

<comment>Now now, that's not nice.</comment>

<comment>What, specifically, does he want beyond the executive orders announced this week?The op-ed seems to suggest he wants people to be able to sue gun makers, sellers and owners for "lethal products." The reason that doesn't go anywhere is because the definition of a gun is something that shoots a bullet. It's like asking us to be outraged that scissors actually- no, seriously - cut paper! Then he gets angry at the notion that this would somehow end up banning guns. You can have scissors, they just can't cut anything and if you think that's somehow a ban on scissors you're a conspiracy theorist. Good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>I know people who sell dozens of guns every year who are not licensed dealers and they do it to turn a profit. You can't do that with cars which kill an equal number of people.</comment>

<comment>Scissors were not designed to kill, although they can.  Guns were designed specifically to kill.  Your analogy is ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>"The op-ed seems to suggest he wants people to be able to sue gun makers, sellers and owners for 'lethal products.'"There is currently a procedural bar immunizing gun manufacturers from being sued on any number of potential cause of action.  This both interferes with the rights of the states when it comes to the law of torts, and prevents any trier of fact from considering such actions.All of the things you mention are substantive issues.  It should be up to court hearing the actions to determine the validity of the case - not some preemptive bar.</comment>

<comment>And there is a good reason for that preemptive bar, which is why it's there. Go ahead, let's hear you argue the actual issue, tell my why you think it's outrageous that a gun is actually, you know, a gun.Remember, this is supposed to be "common sense gun control" and you want lawsuits claiming that firearms function as designed and advertised.</comment>

<comment>We don't know, in advance, what the lawsuits might be claiming.  That's the point.</comment>

<comment>Then you don't know the bar is unreasonable and worthy of our attention. Go ahead and give us an example. Right now the "common sense" read on this is that when you pull the trigger thingy a bullet comes out. This isn't terribly surprising and "fixing" it so that no bullet comes out is a defacto ban. But I'm all ears, go for it.</comment>

<comment>Expensive rifles from Remington were part of a lawsuit on defective triggers.</comment>

<comment>interestingly, the same kind of tort immunity is just about the only way you could ever do drug legalization in the US. The use of coke, even weed, as intended will cause damage. Nobody who saw what happened to the tobacco companies is going to legally, commercially produce and market drugs and the tiny boutiques in "legalized" areas aren't "legalization" - they're just immunity for yuppies. As soon as they have any cash in the bank the lawyers will come.Gun control is dead because there is basically bi-partisan consensus that prohibition doesn't work - i.e. remove access to the item - but it's a useful excuse for busting career criminals. Except nobody believes most gun owners in the US are criminals and cities and the feds actually don't prosecute gun charges for the criminals they do catch with guns. Basically a consensus is forming that we don't want cousin Ed to go to jail because he likes to target shoot and we don't want cousin Sally to go to jail for a joint.</comment>

<comment>Thanks (again) Obama.</comment>

<comment>Funny, that's exactly what Luis Gutierrez said at the White House yesterday to Cecilia Munoz about the expedited removal of undocumented families to Central America.</comment>

<comment>This issue is the perfect example of how a chunk of the electorate refuses to engage in reality.  No matter what assurances are given, there still remains a paranoid group convinced that "they're comin' for our guns."  Would even a cleary articulated Grandfather Clause in the legislation guaranteeing that all legal gun owners would be able to maintain ownership of their legal weapons for life be enough?Moreover, given the overwhelming support for the idea that we need to enforce existing laws, how is their any opposition to properly staffing the FBI and ATF to adequately do so?</comment>

<comment>Grandfather Clause is a racist term. Check your privilege.</comment>

<comment>"Why do you pretend otherwise?"Because I'm neither paranoid nor astroturfing for the NRA.</comment>

<comment>Moreover, given the overwhelming support for the idea that we need to enforce existing laws, how is their any opposition to properly staffing the FBI and ATF to adequately do so?See, that would be a smart question for gun-control advocates to turn on gun rights advocates. And it would be really, really smart for gun rights advocates to in turn push their Congresscritters to fully fund the programs that are supposed to enforce those laws.It's kind of like when someone like Trump or Cruz talks about deportation? "Oh, so you want to increase the INS's budget by a thousand percent?" Make them put their money where their mouths are.</comment>

<comment>What about the next generation of owners to come? Do they get to buy and own guns? And what about the grandfathered owners, can they sell or bequeath their firearms?</comment>

<comment>White people must disarm. Gun ownership is a white privilege.</comment>

<comment>So proud of President Obama for holding the gun debate. It makes you wonder though what the two women who asked questions were listening to when the president outlined his position on gun control! They both made the NRA argument that he is trying to stop them from getting a gun which is totally ridiculous. Both women own a gun, were they prohibited in anyway? Obviously not as they both own one. Thank God the president spoke out about the nonsensical argument that he is going to take their guns away which is another NRA scare tactic which many including those two women fall for hook line and sinker! Anyone who doesn't want to see less gun violence by putting in place laws that restrict people selling guns to others with no background check must not have a heart! Gun shows are where that kind of trading goes on and for people not see something wrong with that is insane.  How can you sell a gun to someone you know nothing about since we know how many shooting we see daily? Obviously making money is far more important to those sellers than caring about what that person may intend to do with it! As regards the president not supporting anyone who does not see the sense in gun control after what we have seen over the years I quite agree with him. This carnage cannot be allowed to continue day in day out year after year after year.</comment>

<comment>Even his gay buddy Anderson made him look like the fool that he has always been.</comment>

<comment>Anderson was stuck on stupid last night. His priority it seemed was to only  involve those who oppose what the president is trying to do. Families of gun victims were there but he concentrated more on the gun advocates.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't take a weatherman to know which way the wind is blowing.</comment>

<comment>Then why has obama said he wanted to take their guns?</comment>

<comment>Do you want the deranged, criminals and terrorists to have easy access to guns?</comment>

<comment>What terrorists...</comment>

<comment>It's amazing that you have internet access in your cave.  It must be pretty limited since you don't seem to have access to the news.</comment>

<comment>I just want you to state what terrorists have bought guns..you made the claim YOU back it up</comment>

<comment>You poor thing.  I don't have time to bring someone so backward up to date on what's happening in the world in 2016.</comment>

<comment>thanks for proving you can't back up your claim..</comment>

<comment>Thanks for verifying you're an extremist incapable for critical thought.</comment>

<comment>nice try but wrong</comment>

<comment>President Obama NEVER once said he's taken away anybody's  guns! That's a myth and a lie perpetrated by the NRA and their ardent supporters.</comment>

<comment>Right after Sandy hook?</comment>

<comment>You must be hard of hearing, he never said he'd take away anybody's guns. That a myth that gun advocates like to perpetuate and it's ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Lizard brains are binary and reflexive.The NRA raises money on fear in many forms.</comment>

<comment>a "ban" means he wants to take something away from you....</comment>

<comment>Scary Black Guy lock yer doors!</comment>

<comment>where?</comment>

<comment>Banning criminals and the mentality unstable from getting a gun should make sense to anyone with a modicum of common sense. If you thinks it's fine for even those people to get a gun you I fear are in the minority.</comment>

<comment>they are already banned</comment>

<comment>I don't think so! Especially if they go to gun shows where nobody bothers to check anything. Gun shows are part of the  problem guns sold to anybody and everybody just to make a quick buck. That's shameful.</comment>

<comment>sorry but you don't understand the law...criminals and mentallu ill are banned from owning guns and there are background checks at shows.When did you last go to a gunshow?</comment>

<comment>There are some reputable dealers at gun shows. There are also some unscrupulous dealers who don't care who they sell to and don't insist on any form of background check. Why do you think some can't for gun shows? It's not because they want to stand in line and fill out forms. It maybe because they know they can get any kind of gun they want no questions asked.</comment>

<comment>You don't understand... ALL dealers MUST do a check... There is zero exception..</comment>

<comment>All dealers must do a check!  If they are reputable dealers that may be the case.  If not, what other less scrupulous dealers may end up doing may be something entirely different.  Especially those who don't like government telling them what to do to start with. There are many out there who are anti-government so why would some gun dealers  who may be anti-government follow the rules for background checks?</comment>

<comment>Because if a dealer doesn't do the check he becomes a felon... Rather quickly..It's federal law...dealers must do the check... Period</comment>

<comment>You are saying dealers must do a check and so they should but what about those who sell out of the back of a truck or car who are not real dealers? Who is going to make sure they do a background check? That's the problem as those type of sellers are out there.They are the ones who some people buy their guns from because there are no questions asked. By the way, it's nice that we are having a civil conversation and not doing any name calling because both sides have an opinion and it's best to do it without any nastiness.</comment>

<comment>If you are "dealing" without a license it's a felony..and has been sine 1968</comment>

<comment>She sure has a problem understanding such simple concepts..You have to wonder.Is it denial, or is it an inability to absorb facts that go against her prejudice ?</comment>

<comment>It maybe a felony but as I had said earlier if people are selling guns out the back of a truck or car who is there to ensure they have a license which would be highly unlikely in that case let alone enforce a background check on their buyers? Reputable sellers having a license and doing background checks is one thing but what about the ones I mentioned above who are not reputable sellers? They are the ones who are flying under the radar and selling guns to anyone. That's why some people cross state lines where gun shows are plentiful as they know some of those states have lax laws so they can buy whatever arms they like. Guns shows are the one thing as far as I'm concerned that should be banned. If people want to buy a gun let them buy from reputable dealers in a store where the laws are abided by.</comment>

<comment>So there's already a law.But the law is not being enforced..So your solution is to pass more laws (which won't be enforced..)You're just being ignorant and scapegoating gun shows because it's an easy, superficial, "no thought" target for such as youBut hey.You've already shown yourself both fact and reality averse,,</comment>

<comment>You are a gun advocate so you will find an excuse for the gun no matter what. Goodbye Attila.</comment>

<comment>And you are a coward, who doesn't even have the moral courage to honestly address the problem.Anytime you are presented with a question that will prove how false your claims are you run away.</comment>

<comment>I've put forth my opinion on guns to you and others over and over. Just because you don't like or agree with what I say does not mean I'm not addressing the problem.  False claims! There are unscrupulous dealers out there who do sell out the back of trucks where no questions are asked! That's one thing you and others don't want to admit. If I agreed with you all would be well. Well, I don't so that's the end of the matter.</comment>

<comment>Yes You have put forth your "opinion"But the problem is that your opinion is equivalent to declaring that the sky is purple and the moon is made of cream cheeseAnd you are both unable and even more unwilling to look at your opinion and do some rational thinking about it.Your nonsense projetion about who does or doesn't admit anything about "unscrupulous dealers selling out of the back of trucks" is just another declaration that you can NOT support by ANY evidence.This is made worse when you stupidly declare that anyone selling a single gun is a "dealer".With such defintions and declarations, you just demonstrate that your position is:a) not defensible,b) not rational.This is not a place for ex catedra declarations.Most people do want to figure out WHY you hold the position you hold.But all you apparently are able to do, is just- repeat yoursef- make some fatuous declarations-make even more fatuous defintions to justify your declarationsYou have the choice.Either you participate in a rational debate and support your claims with valid and thoughtful argumentsOr you will get shot down, every time you make another fatuous declaration.But you can be assured, that your nonsense will be shown as nonsense..</comment>

<comment>Well as I've pointed out numerous times.... It's already against the law to be a dealer without a license...If i go to sell one or two of my guns at a show I am most certainly not a dealer.</comment>

<comment>The minute you sell a gun to someone else you are dealer albeit in a small way. By the way if you sold any of your guns would you do a background check or would you just sell them with no questions asked? If the answer to a background check is no that's my problem with people selling without a license and who are not reputable gun dealers.</comment>

<comment>I am not a dealer according to federal law.If the background check line was open so I could call in the check I most certainly would.</comment>

<comment>So are you saying if the check line was closed you would go ahead a sell a gun anyway? If so that I would find problematic. No one should be able to get a gun from anywhere without a background check at least.  It's not an infringement on anyone's rights it's the right to thing to do to keep guns out of the hands of those who may have malicious intent. Even some who buy guns by legal means and with a background check have shot and killed people simply because they got angry at someone. So it's not ALL about keeping guns out of the hands of the mentally ill or criminals. Sane law abiding citizens can and do use a gun as an equalizer to solve problems. That's what scares me.</comment>

<comment>Then like I said earlier.. Open up the check line so all sellers can call it in...currently only dealers can.If I had access to the line as a private seller I'd use it.</comment>

<comment>From your response you sound like a very responsible person. That's a credit to you. It's been so nice talking to you about this issue. Even though I'm not in favor of guns myself I do realize the 2nd amendment affords people the right to own them. So you have a great day.</comment>

<comment>1_ Do you even KNOW that individual sellers are NOT allowed to use the NICS system to do a background check on a buyer ?If you find that problematic, the fight to have the Brady law changed so that ANYONE wanting to sell a gun has the OPTION of doing a background check.2a) There is NO "right to keep guns out of the hands of those who may have malicious intent"And frankly there is NO WAY for ANYONE to read someone else's mind to figure out if they have "malicious intent"(If ever you invent a good crystal ball for that, you will become very rich)2b) Clearly the failures of the present system of background checks has NO WAY to verify for a buyer's malicious intent Nor will ANY change in the current system develop any MAGICAL ability to do so.So in effect you want and expect the background check system to do something that is COMPLETE FANTASY and totally UNFEASABLE in reality.3) The NEAR TOTALLY majority of sane and law-abiding gun owners use guns as equalizers to defend themselves from criminals far more otten than anything else.Up to an estimated 2,500,000 times a year.Which is MULTIPLES of any used for nefarious purposes.Why do you keep ignoring the other, beneficial side of gun ownership ?Is your paranoia about guns so great, that all you can see is the bad side and completely ignore the far greater good side ?</comment>

<comment>So by you're logic, if- you sell something at a garage sale, you're a dealer- you sell your used car, you're a dealer- you sell an old bike you don't need, you're a dealer- you sell your house, you're a dealer..Anything else you want to add to that stupid definition ?Your loaded questions only leads to stupid conclusionsWe'll leave you in your fantasy universe.</comment>

<comment>No.. you are NOT a dealer.A dealer is a commercial entity.Tell me...if a background check is so important, why did gun control politicians defeat the ONLY, ACTUAL universal background check bill that covered ALL transfers, ever presented to Congress?</comment>

<comment>Hey, at least he didn't say something like this:. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons...[guns are] a ridiculous way to solve problems that have to be solved among people of good will.‚ÄùOr this:"You do know that I am a member of the NRA and my position on the right to bear arms is well known...But I want you to know something else, and I am going to say it in clear, unmistakable language: I support the Brady Bill and I urge Congress to enact it without further delay.‚Äù</comment>

<comment>. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no reason why on the street today a citizen should be carrying loaded weapons...Here is the part you left out.said California Gov. Ronald Reagan in May 1967, after two dozen Black Panther Party members walked into the California Statehouse carrying rifles to protest a gun-control bill.Was Reagan a racist?</comment>

<comment>You're the one saying that, mi hermano. Not me.</comment>

<comment>It seems Reagan was offended that black people would protest while carrying guns.</comment>

<comment>Be scared when a progressive uses the term "common sense", or "reasonable".</comment>

<comment>Yeah, only metrosexual urban egg-heads use terms like that.  Code words for oppression.</comment>

<comment>That is true.</comment>

<comment>1. If "Australian style" gun control respects the second amendment, I'll eat my shoes. It was mandatory confiscation of guns that had been deemed unfit for non-government actors to own. Both the confiscation and the illusion of method in classification would fail both the Second Amendment's "common use" clarified in Heller as well as the Fourth for violating unreasonable search/seizure to enforce it (because what portion of the 300M up for grabs would actually get warrants granted?)2. If you think that the NRA is louder, shriller, or better funded than Bloomberg and his array of "news" organizations on guns and the tiny "grassroots" groups that support him, you might want to do some research on the work done by both sides. The NRA is far from perfect, but many gun control advocates have rightfully earned the title of "anti-gunners" who have absolutely no qualms about standing on the backs of the dead to make pre-determined talking points that have little or no relevancy to the problem of violence in America. At least the NRA adds value to society in its near-endless array of excellent training and safety programs for all ages, genders, sexual orientations, and levels of proficiency. All MDA and their ilk have to stand on are poorly researched policies and endless reducto ad absurdums and arguments that appeal entirely to pathos, disregarding legal precedent and good judgment in the process.3. For the record, Obama's EA was actually pretty reasonable. It was 7 years late on beefing up the NICS data quality, and on actually pretending to enforce existing gun laws. My only issue is that it is awfully vague in its definition of who requires an FFL. These are the kind of policy changes we need, not pie-in-the sky bans, capacity limits, and needless legal hoops that miss the most basic facts of the situation.</comment>

<comment>Be wary of their motives and the fine print that only a pedantic few get to read in the Federal Register.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that if you have a CCW, a hunting license or a membership in a gun club, The Government Already Knows About Your Guns...</comment>

<comment>"My only issue is that it is awfully vague in its definition of who requires an FFL."This is because the White House has no power to clarify what it means to be "in the business of selling firearms".  The White House does not interpret statute - the Courts do.  All Obama can do is tell people, here are the various factors that Courts have considered in determining whether someone is in the business of selling firearms.</comment>

<comment>Understood. I guess the conspiracy theorist in me is worried that there's at least some intent to define "in the business of selling firearms" vaguely enough as to dampen private sellers' willingness to do so for fear of unexpected legal consequences. Obviously this doesn't help any real problems, as the kind of people who are wondering if they need an FFL aren't the ones indiscriminately selling to criminals.</comment>

<comment>No, it's just an attempt to end-run legislation to give sellers the same definitions you find in states like California and New York, where all firearm sales and exchanges (even an inheritance) have to go through an FFL. It's not evil, and once you get used to it, it's just tedium (seriously, there are shops here in California that will even waive their fees for inter-family exchange, stuff like that).</comment>

<comment>Never said it's evil, nor do I believe that.I do, however, think it's ineffective. Sellers should always be encouraged to do background checks on their buyers, and smart/responsible ones already do. However, making it law ends up with silliness like you described - requirements to do checks for intra-family transfers, and in some poorly worded statutes you'd even be required to do a check before *loaning* a firearm to someone to shoot at the range. Asinine.All the while, the sellers of all stripes who are irresponsible, purposefully criminal, negligent, etc. are ignoring these policies. If we know there's a problem of well-intentioned sellers unknowingly providing firearms to criminals, then UBCs fit the bill and solve that problem. Is that really what we see in the statistics, though? (spoiler: no, it's not!)Background checks aren't free as is, and some exceptions in CA don't change that. Imposing additional cost ought to have demonstrable, enforceable benefit, and I don't think that "universal" checks pass that bar.</comment>

<comment>Good post. If Obama really wants to do something to curb gun violence, he should go after straw purchasers. Worry less about Bobby American giving his grandson his gun collection and go after straw purchasers. If places like Chicago won't prosecute straw purchasers, Obama can direct U.S. Attorneys to prosecute straw purchases under federal law since many go across state lines.</comment>

<comment>Straw buyers are on the radar and I think that's a good move. I also think that setting up gun courts to fast-track gun crimes in the criminal justice system is a good move.Look, I'm a gun owner. I like guns. I don't fetishize them or think they're sexy, I take them for what they are -- lethal tools. I don't intend to get rid of mine, ever. I think that everyone should be able to own guns, outside of felons and mental cases...but then everyone knows at least one person who has no business owning even a Daisy Red Ryder BB rifle, if for no other reason than he'd be a danger to himself with it. Most of what Obama is talking about here is making the current laws stick, and putting some teeth in them. It's pretty modest.I say that if you do anything to show that you're not responsible with a firearm -- you wave a gun because someone cut you off in traffic, you discharge a gun within city limits, threaten someone because they owe you $50 or said something that hurt your feelings -- you lose your right to own one. PERIOD. Men come over to your house and take every damn gun and bullet you own because you're not mature enough to have them. You go on probation or serve jail time and one of the conditions is that you never, ever get your hands on a gun again. Break probation and off to jail you go.My mom was a mental health RN back in the 80s and one client at her county agency had regular shrink appointments (probably court ordered). All he talked about was how many guns he had, what kind and how many people he wanted to settle scores with. To my mind, someone like that needs to be flagged in the system and checked on regularly, confidentiality be damned. It's time to start moving in a constructive direction here and not just keep screaming at each other and talking about why every last proposal won't work.</comment>

<comment>I'm with you. I too, own and carry guns, and think it's a tough responsibility that has to be taken seriously. I agree on your second and third paragraphs more or less, but there would have to be enough protections that inadvertent showing of a pistol or an offhand comment to a mental health professional shouldn't deprive someone of the right to defend themselves forever. I would be afraid that a lowest-common-denominator government would flag even the most innocuous stuff on the "you can't be too cautious" line of thinking that so many bureaucrats have.Also, another thing Obama could have done (heck, the NRA shouldn't have any problem with this) is promote friends and family should look out for people and, if necessary, remove firearms from someone's house if that person temporarily presents themselves as a danger.I'm a vet and one my fellow vets was getting suicidal so some of us talked him into letting us take his weapons for awhile until he settled down.</comment>

<comment>So people on the right don't care about the 30,000 who die from guns (or the tens of thousands more who are maimed)Got it.</comment>

<comment>18,000 of those are suicides.  Simple question: do people have the right to end their own lives?  If so, what does it matter what instrumentality they use to do it?</comment>

<comment>Because people without guns are more likely to fail in an attempt at suicide and not try to do so again.  Fewer people would die due to suicide if guns weren't easily available.  More people die in this country in general because we have lots and lots of guns.  That is a fact.The reality is that guns in private hands will continue.  There will be no wholesale bans or confiscations.  We're arguing around the margins.  Automatic or semi-automatic?  How big should the magazines be?  What's the best method to register and end straw purchases to keep them out of the hands of the deranged, criminals and terrorists?  Guns will continue to be readily available in the US to law abiding citizens.</comment>

<comment>Do you, or do you not, support the right to assisted suicide? If so, why do you oppose people having the option to commit suicide in an effective, relatively painless manner?</comment>

<comment>Beside the point.  People die from violence, suicide and accidents because of ready access to guns.  Gun supporters like to pretend that is not the case.  If you want guns available, more will die.  That's the trade off.  Admit it and make the case for why you still think ready access to guns is an inherent good.</comment>

<comment>A little reasonableness on both sides might just end the war.  :-)</comment>

<comment>I don't think that it's the job of the government to prevent suicides. That makes death by suicide a non-issue for me. Homicide is an issue. About 12,000 people die a year. Many of them would probably dies even with a complete ban on guns in America. Many of those killed are themselves violent criminals and - frankly - I don't consider them a particularly high priority. The number of truly innocent people killed by guns (as at Sandy Hook) is much, much smaller than 12,000.By contrast, Communist and Fascist regimes have killed millions of their citizens. Pol Pot killed 1/3 of Cambodians. The CCP killed 30 million people in China. North Korea has killed millions and has slave camps where hundreds of thousands if not millions live in inhuman conditions. And unlike gun victims in America, most of those killed or enslaved were truly innocents.Tyrannical government is a far more effective killer than any gang member.  An armed population is insurance (however imperfect) against tyranny. That's why I support gun rights.</comment>

<comment>This is the worst possible argument ever.  No armed citizenry has ever prevented the rise of fascism (or communism or any authoritarian or totalitarian regime) ever.</comment>

<comment>In point of fact, every fascist and communist regime has disarmed its citizenry. There's a reason why. In fact, the entire point of the first amendment was that the Founders worried about government tyranny.</comment>
