<comment>and GWS as the head of the DNC</comment>

<comment>Israel is my congressman and was surprised about his choosing not to run for re-election.Then realized that the district leans Democrat but it is not a Democrat shoe-in.The people mentioned today in the newspaper as possible candidates in either party are not people anyone can get excited about. But it is very early.</comment>

<comment>It's kind of an open secret that he has nuclear weapons.</comment>

<comment>My question to Ms. Kelly.Which district in New York does Mr. Israel represent, and why is it a competitive district?It seems that this information would come under the heading of " no brainer ".If this basic information didn't enter your mind as important, it should have occurred to your editor.The type of people who read these articles tend to be political junkies. We shouldn't have to go to Google.</comment>

<comment>Steve was my Congressman until some recent redistricting. An immense talent who helped his Island, his constituents, and our country.The guy will be missed. Wait it gets better -- I am mostly a Republican.</comment>

<comment>So is he (a crooked one).</comment>

<comment>Absolutely not -- Rep. Israel is and always has been honest and hard working.Where on earth did you get anything about "crooked" from my post?If your lame joke was that I often vote for Republican candidates if they are the best for the job and therefore have a streak of fibbing, OK, but leave my former Congressman out of it -- a true gentlemen who did amazing work for his district and country.</comment>
