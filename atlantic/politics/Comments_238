<comment>If Lee wants to restore luster to the legislative branch, he'd better distance himself from the people who take a government paycheck based on a platform of destroying government.That includes most of the GOP presidential candidates.</comment>

<comment>Haha! Yep, if you want to make even the slightest cut to any gov't program, you want to "destroy government."</comment>

<comment>And then the people who accuse budget cutters of wanting to "destroy" government will deny that they, themselves are preservers of the status quo.</comment>

<comment>As Reagan said: "Status Quo is another way of saying "the mess we're in"".</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that follows.  Are you on drugs?</comment>

<comment>Does that include the military?</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about?</comment>

<comment>Sorry, it's over your head.</comment>

<comment>Want to restore the "luster" of Congress?Maybe stop using it as a campaign platform by passing wholly symbolic legislation and do something meaningful?  Hundreds of post office namings.  80 symbolic Obamacare repeals. Dozens of symbolic Benghazi panels.  Several resolutions in support of prayer and 'In God We Trust' both of which are already legal.Oh, and maybe 'work' (if what Congress does can be called 'work') more than four months out of the year?</comment>

<comment>Thank you, this is what I was thinking also. Get down to working on the problems of the country and stopt worrying about who gets credit.</comment>

<comment>So, you think the legislature's only function is to spend the money that you think it should spend?</comment>

<comment>Nice straw man.Please make a legitimate argument or rebuttal of some sort and I'll be happy to have a discussion with you.</comment>

<comment>"Oh, and maybe 'work' more than four months out of the year?"I actually agree with that. They're a bunch of overpaid, underworked bureaucrats, and it should be LIMITED GOVERNMENT conservatives that speak out against that, but they all like their paychecks, clearly.</comment>

<comment>If anyone wants to see what the absolute idiots in the so-called "House Freedom Caucus" would amount to if given real power at the federal level, take a gander at the state of Kansas - broke, cutting vital services to children, the elderly and the infirm, and stealing money from the DOT to pay for the state general fund.These people are out for one thing: power and money. That's it. They don't love America, or Americans. They love a pay day, and they're willing to use hate, fear and the general ignorance of voters to get there.</comment>

<comment>Yessir! Spend money and buy yourself some votes. And hide behind the children and old people while you're doing it. It's the New Deal way!</comment>

<comment>Just wondering if he fell through that hole in the mountain behind him. He looked somewhat surprised as to where he was and what he was really doing there. Maybe no one told him Donald Trump is sucking up all the oxygen in the room and don't really care what he or any other Republican has to say. People are on the crazy Trump train as it roars across the country picking up more and more people who couldn't care less about a serious person running the country far more interested in the joker from Batman.</comment>

<comment>That's the Double Arch in Arches National Park in Utah, which I suspect is why he chose to be photographed in front of it. But yes, I think you're right about his chances of getting anyone to pay attention.</comment>

<comment>Reader pro tip: When the phrase "sat down together" appears, skim the article until you find the single substantive paragraph. This is the journalists' code for "did a single interview but had to write a full article."</comment>

<comment>Ywn. Baggers gonna bag. This isn't going anywhere.</comment>
