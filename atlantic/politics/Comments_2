<comment>Why is Carson even on the debate stage?   Kasich at least has an argument that he could take Ohio, Massachusetts, & Michigan.  Those are three winner take all states.   I can't think of a single state where Carson has a realistic shot at third at this point.</comment>

<comment>That is because some people do not run with the aim of winning or even being VP, but simply to further their name recognition and sell more books.</comment>

<comment>Blame the new stations and the GOP for allowing such an overcrowded field</comment>

<comment>Don't you mean blame Citizens v. United?</comment>

<comment>A minor correction.  It's actually Citizens United versus the FEC.</comment>

<comment>Carson's still into fleecing a few donors.</comment>

<comment>How is he fleecing them?  Is he pocketing the money rather than using it for his campaign?</comment>

<comment>He's using his money to fund more telemarketing campaignsby companies run by friends of hisnot to mention selling more copies of his book</comment>

<comment>You would think such a crime would, you know, make news.</comment>

<comment>Not really a crime but yes it's been reported on</comment>

<comment>It did.  I just read an article about it the other day on CNN, I believe.  Carson was trying to play it like he too was being victimized.</comment>

<comment>That's the entire post- Citizens United world. You essentially can't regulate political contributions. The pols can simply minimally launder donations and use them however they wish.</comment>

<comment>The photo says it all..http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/a...</comment>

<comment>His campaign people have been keeping the money for themselves for the most part.  He just found out about it, says he.</comment>

<comment>Oy.</comment>

<comment>The Popeye's Full Scholarship Artist Formerly Known As Ghetto Bro' Stabby Hands Tutankhamun.</comment>

<comment>Carson and Kasich need to drop out, but anyone thinking all their votes will go to Rubio are smoking something.</comment>

<comment>There is no reason at for all of Kasich's votes to not go to Rubio. Carson's might split towards Cruz, but if they would keep choosing a losing Carson over Cruz, then there must be something inherently anti-cruz about them.</comment>

<comment>Their voters (and Cruzs) will have to break for Rubio over Trump 2 to 1 for him to beat Trump. That's unrealistic.</comment>

<comment>Trump only has a 3rd of the vote. Your numbers are off big time. With voters from Bush, he is already just 8 points behind. He'll be on equal footing with Kasich's voters, and will only go up from there. Those voting for Cruz and Rubio are voting against Trump; they won't go for him.</comment>

<comment>Carson needs to forget about it.  But Kasich has a claim to being best able to beat Hillary, according to the Real Clear Politics average of polls.http://www.realclearpolitics.c...Rubio is a boy, Cruz is a crank and Trump is well, Trump.  Kasich would scare Hillary.  All the others will be child's play for her.</comment>

<comment>All true, and Kasich is rising quickly--he was at 2.5% a month ago, and now is close to cracking 10% (for reference, Rubio is only at 16.7%") - http://www.realclearpolitics.c...I think Kasich has a plausible case for hanging in, unless and until he fails to get traction in some of the "moderate" states yet to vote.</comment>

<comment>Like his home state of Ohio.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. And suppose Trump beats Rubio in Florida, but Kasich beats Trump in Ohio. That would give Kasich a lot of leverage to argue that he, and not Rubio, should own the establishment lane, because at least he could beat Trump in his home state. (This is very much hypothetical, but within the realm of possibility).</comment>

<comment>Trump was leading in Ohio.</comment>

<comment>yep</comment>

<comment>If he's completely shut out of Super Tuesday, then he's done.  But I suspect that he's going to have a good day, and suddenly the media will notice that he's running.</comment>

<comment>You are right, man.  The phrase has fallen into disuse, but the GOP field is a clown bus.And GOP supporters are clowns.  Look at the drivel of Courageousmisterj and spudwhisperer.</comment>

<comment>We just got lucky today - they're evidently on another article.</comment>

<comment>Kasich might very well be able to beat Clinton but that's pretty irrelevant at this point.  If everyone else dropped out he might come close in the primary, but they won't. Rubio thinks he should be the one to lose to Trump, and Cruz would rather burn the party down than let someone else get the nomination.The only real option the GOP has at this point is to hang it up, purge the party of the racists and bigot and start over. Maybe they can turn it around in a decade or so.</comment>

<comment>You're going to deeply misunderstand the Trump phenomenon if you simply right it off as white male rage.  Whatever happens to his or Sanders' candidacies they really have created a watershed event in American politics.Both men have tapped into the very same middle class anger at both parties' elites for having sold them out and actively hurting them with trade, finance, immigration and foreign policy for the past 30 years.  What's different on the Dem side is that they realize it hasn't only been those meanie Republicans, but their own party too. What's different on the Republican side is that the voters are rejecting what had been conservative orthodoxy of Trickle Down, every man for himself, globalist economics since Reagan.  It's amazing that Cruz, among other idolators of Reagan, "standing up for the middle class" like some FDR era Dem.We are seeing a return to what used to be standard in American politics: nationalism and populism and it's not necessarily unhealthy.This is not advocacy for Trump or his so-called "solutions."  He's a farce.  But he's also harnessed the very same voice of the middle class that Bernie Sanders has.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't go so far as to call it a watershed event, but I'm not denying that it's a real phenomenon. I just have less sympathy for the passive electorate that sat and watched it happen over last 30 years. There's no secretive cabal pulling the strings of government. Everything is and has been out in the open and the American voters are the ones who put the crooks in office. Some of them probably figured they would get some of the loot, well they didn't now they're pissed. Sure, the populist movements tear down the power structures, but if you take history as a guide that's about all they do.  When the revolutionaries come down out of the hills they occupy the palace and the people start looking for their share of the loot.Good conservative ideals like responsible self governance and progressive ideals like justice and equity are only possible in a democracy with an electorate that is engaged and willing to work for the common good.  There are no "solutions". The republicans want to tear down the government. Sanders want's to tear down the banks. Fine.  What exactly is it they are going to build?</comment>

<comment>You and I are singing the same tune. I think both Bernie and Trump point out a lot of the right problems, but don't have the right answers.  I don't even know if Trump has genuinely even bothered to elucidate any "answers."I see them as shock troops which will shock the status quo and scare the major parties into actually considering the middle class again.  Governance actually does require building things and it takes people who know government.</comment>

<comment>Wahoo! Debate nite on CNN.Time for my tidy whities and cheezies.</comment>

<comment>One wonders how Cruz open carry types will mix with Trump concealed carry types?</comment>

<comment>it could be action-packed.</comment>

<comment>Plant.</comment>

<comment>Desperate establishment Republicans are trying to conjure up a controversy.  I don't think many people really care about Trump's tax returns.  I don't.</comment>

<comment>That statement is very telling.</comment>

<comment>I don't expect a guy whose avatar indicates that Obama has destroyed the very foundation of America and that America needs to now be "restored" would give a shit about Trump's tax returns.  I expect if you saw video of Trump snorting coke with the leader of ISIS  it wouldn't phase you.</comment>

<comment>Obama will be burdening the U.S. with $20 trillion in debt when he leaves office.   Do you care about that?Since 2009 Obama's policies have resulted in more Americans living in poverty and more Americans depending on or getting some form of welfare.   Do you care about that?The world today is more chaotic and more dangerous because of Obama.  Does that phase you?Given how bad things are now in the U.S. and around the world, I really don't think Trump's tax returns are the most important thing to worry about these days.And by the way, it is Obama who has used illegal street drugs (and possibly still does).</comment>

<comment>I'm not crazy about Obamacare - I prefer it to be tweaked - but I'd rather debt be created by helping Americans get healthcare rather than bombing, invading and occupying foreign countries.Actually, it's due to the longest and deepest recession in American history which resulted in the slow growth during Obama's tenure.  You don't get to ignore that when he came into office the economy was shedding 800,000 jobs per month, and people were losing their homes and 401ks.  It was not only the depth of that near-depression that was so bad, but that it was directly linked to the banking industry and it took so long for money to get back to flowing into the economy.  And now the economy is actually finally doing pretty well.Do you care about these facts?  And what would you have had a President McCain or Romney do that Obama has not done? Seriously, that's not a trick question.The world today is more chaotic and dangerous because the world is more chaotic and dangerous.  How does America put a lid back on the Sunni-Shia cauldron?  How do we put Syria back together?  How do we put a shattered Iraq back together?  Again, he inherited a lot of shit.  I don't blame him for it any more than I blame W for 9/11.  It's called life.  It's called reality.  We can't control every bad thing in the world, and we'll bankrupt and exhaust ourselves trying.  I thank God every day we didn't vote John "Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb, Iran" McCain in.Oh no!  Obama smoked pot and admitted to it!  "Street drugs!"  Eeeeekkk! God knows Trump never snorted any coke during the '80s.</comment>

<comment>BOOM!</comment>

<comment>The debt burden was incurred by George W. Bush.</comment>

<comment>I'm not convinced that Trump supporters care about anything fact-based, really.</comment>

<comment>Trump is about to knock off both Rubio and Cruz.</comment>

<comment>He may already have done so.</comment>

<comment>The CNN wrestling match-style intro is disturbingly similar to the Battle for the White House segments from the Onion from several years ago.</comment>

<comment>Trump's got what plants crave!</comment>

<comment>Cruz will come out breathing fire.Rubio, however, will probably be more high-minded, as he is cultivating a brand as the mature candidate you can be proud of (as opposed to Donald, who gets high marks on the 'I'd be embarrassed if my party nominated him' question).The best chance to stop the Donald Trump train at this point would be for Cruz or Rubio to drop out, but in a bit of cosmic irony, they can both make equally good cases that they are the one who should stay in, so neither of them is going anywhere. It's kind of funny how the universe has lined up to give Donald these perfect conditions to ride to victory with 35% of the national vote. The party elders would love to pressure Cruz to drop, but he doesn't respond to that kind of pressure, and they won't pressure Rubio to drop because they hate Cruz as much as they hate Trump!</comment>

<comment>If anything, Kasich is the one that can make the claim that he's the best candidate to beat Clinton, if the Real Clear Politics poll of polls means anything:http://www.realclearpolitics.c...That said, they also show both Cruz and Rubio beating Hillary and I just can't imagine Cruz would get anywhere against her, and lil' Marco I don't think so.</comment>

<comment>It hasn't yet.</comment>

<comment>Rubio / Kasich or Kasich / Rubio was what it was supposed to be this year. So many things have gone wrong since.The first and biggest thing that went wrong was Jeb, who entered and took all the party apparatus in an ill-fated campaign for the most milquetoast candidate in American history. All that apparatus and money should have gone to Rubio and Kasich since day one.But Kasich was slow to enter because of Jeb's early fundraising dominance. He never got his footing. Entered the game too late.Add in a crowded field that split the anti-Trump vote all the way through South Carolina, mix in Chris Christie's kamikazi attacks on Rubio in New Hampshire, and now add in this weird dynamic where Rubio and Cruz are in a stalemate, and the conditions have just been perfect for a hostile takeover of the Republican party.</comment>

<comment>Good analysis.  I think that Kasich has a shot to be the Last Normal and Acceptable Candidate Standing on the GOP field.  Cruz has very narrow support, mostly among hard right wingers and evangelicals.  Rubio?  Who really likes him?  He's so green, glib, over-rehearsed and has an extremely thin resume.  His speeches are all so apocalyptic and his foreign policy is panicky and insane.  He's easily flattered and easily wounded.  He's not good under pressure.  Not a good temperament for a POTUS.  I don't see him wearing well at all.</comment>

<comment>I cannot think clearly about Kasich. I irrationally despise that man. There's just something about him that isn't right.</comment>

<comment>Quasimodo without the hump?</comment>

<comment>I honestly can't think of any public person with better experience for the job as POTUS.  We often talk about the supposed great "Clinton budget."  It was actually the Gingrich budget forced at gun point on Billy Boy, and Kasich was a huge member of that budget committee.  He's worked on congressional budgets, military committees and has been a very successful governor of Ohio.  A great, humane, decent guy.I lose my shit over anything Clinton. I just find those people so foul and entitled and cynical.</comment>

<comment>He has an intensity that reminds me a bit of McCain... and his temper certainly shows at times. I'm not sure that kind of temper is a good quality for a president.Nevertheless I will forever have a soft spot for Katich taking a donor wife to task at a fund-raiser for the ultra rich. Legendary.</comment>

<comment>Trump and Cruz both have scary tempers, and they boil up at small slights.  Not a good quality.</comment>

<comment>I hadn't heard that story.  But I was impressed by his demeanor and he seems like the most "normal" (whatever that is - can't even tell lately).</comment>

<comment>That fact that much of the woman's fortune was literally built by taxpayers (in this case, her hubby's ball park) makes it especially juicy.http://www.politico.com/story/...[EDIT]: And this is some good commentary on the incident: http://nymag.com/daily/intelli...</comment>

<comment>Kasich is just about the only candidate worthy of the office.  This guy has actually run a large important state and has won some support from people of all stripes.</comment>

<comment>You assume Hillary is going to be the nominee.  It is more likely than not but Trump's chances of being the nominee of his party are better than Hillary's chances of being the nominee of her party.  So far there have been 3 Democratic contests one of which she squeaked by in what was essentially a tie, one that she won by 5% and one that she lost by over 20%.  She is likely to win by a comfortable margin in South Carolina, but analysis has shown she is weak in male and white voters and of course does abysmally with young voters.  She is likely to do well in Southern states with black votes but there are no Southern primaries after March 15.  A West Virginia poll has shown her way behind Sanders which illustrates her weaknesses white voters.  While Trump has almost cinched the nomination and may after Super Tuesday Sanders may win 4 or 5 states (of 11) on that date.  She still is the better bet but it's a long way from being over.</comment>

<comment>You could be right.  I'd really be shocked if Bernie got the nomination, however.</comment>

<comment>We shall see. Super Tuesday may clarify the picture.  I still think at the moment that Hillary is more likely but Bernie has a pretty good chance.</comment>

<comment>Well, whatever becomes of Bernie's campaign, he's been running the Democratic agenda this season.  Hillary has been doing nothing but trying to play catch up and "me too!" with Bernie.  Good for him.</comment>

<comment>Yes but she will have to move a lot more.</comment>

<comment>It's the perfect storm.  Cruz has nice lead in new polls out of Texas--might even get a majority vote and trigger WTA provision to sweep-up all the delegates.   And polling this week in FL has Trump still beating Rubio by double digits.   Cruz may have the better case for staying in and there's NO way the GOP lets Rubio drop out.Loving it.</comment>

<comment>No one really knows the answer to that second question with this Pope.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps.Jesus was not a theocrat.  This Pope guy is a rock star who meddled in US politics.Trump nailed him on the Vatican Wall thing.  Say what you will about Mr. Trump, I kind of liked the way he did not kowtow to the Pope.</comment>

<comment>I liked it, too. And I'm Catholic!</comment>

<comment>Nothing new - he disses ANYONE who disagrees with him.</comment>

<comment>If Trump's wall is modeled after the Vatican wall it will cover only a fraction of the border and the rest of it will be completely open.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the Pope's comments were calibrated on American exceptionalism.  Are you guys nuts?</comment>

<comment>Is there something Trump does that you don't like?</comment>

<comment>Trump will need to steal some of Hillary's constituency in order to win in November.If I were to advise him, I would tell him to portray himself as a modern day Nelson "Rocky" Rockefeller.  Rocky was the last Republican to support the concept of organized labor.Trump, like Rocky, is a New York tycoon who finances his own campaigns... no special interests have financial  influence.Trump. like Rocky, is a secular humanist, not a Christian theocrat.All of that would appeal to blue-collar males who are registered Democrats and do not trust Mrs. Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Trump, unlike Rocky, is married to a bodacious Slovenian that can barely utter a word of the Queen's English.This appeals to all red blooded males.</comment>

<comment>Well, there is that too.  She stirs my Slavic roots.</comment>

<comment>Forget the bombshell in Trump's tax returns..</comment>

<comment>Right.  Trump is married to a bombshell.  Hubba! Hubba!</comment>

<comment>Just how shallow are these voters?</comment>

<comment>They went for Sarah "T&A" Palin... enuff said.</comment>

<comment>I saw the Bodacious Slovenians at Hardly Strictly Bluegrass 2013. Their bass player was too loud, but her piercings were awesome!</comment>

<comment>Trump will steal huge chunks of Hillary's constituency in November. 6% of blacks voted for Romney in 2012. Recent polls have 40% of blacks choosing Trump over Hillary.And with blue collar whites, the news is even worse for Hillary. The NY Times did a piece last month about the panic among leadership in the largest blue collar unions in the country. While the leaders have already endorsed Hillary, the workers themselves are much more interested in Trump.</comment>

<comment>Trump needs to seize on that opportunity.</comment>

<comment>"Recent polls have 40% of blacks choosing Trump over Hillary."That's amazing.</comment>

<comment>And dubious.</comment>

<comment>And totally ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>I really have a hard time believing that 40% of blacks choose Trump over Hillary.  I mean, I can believe they can't stand Hillary, but Trump is such a racist, come ON!</comment>

<comment>If Republicans go really after Trump it will only be after Cruz is no longer a factor.</comment>

<comment>Trump should ignore Ted Bundy and Stupor Mario and instead go after Clinton at every opportunity. He should broach some of the important subjects plaguing voters since they got up from their naps: Is she a lesbian? Is she one of those intergalactic reptilian overlords? Is she a lesbian intergalactic reptilian overlord? No one can casually toss ludicrous innuendo at a TV camera like Donald Hieronymus Trump.He'll smell like the nominee, which is the same thing as being the nominee.</comment>

<comment>I feel like my work is done now that Jeb! is finished.  </comment>

<comment>I'll know Trump has really won the nomination when the Democrats start attacking him.</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Rubio are too scared to attack Trump so they'll probably go after Kasich. Either way, I want to see if tonight's entertainment will match the SC debate :)</comment>

<comment>Let's play Robot Rubio!</comment>

<comment>Or Creepy Cruz.</comment>

<comment>A Trump man I see!</comment>

<comment>Blame Rubio and Cruz, but the so-called Republican establishment really has 1 card to play here. En masse, they need to denounce Trump and pledge to not support him at all if/when he wins the nomination. This means governors, Senators, Congressmen, former presidential candidates and presidents....the whole lot of them. Step up.Big boy pants. Put them on and stop whining.</comment>

<comment>Truth is the Fox format for early debates kept the biting criticism off Trump early until he could consolidate his position.  IMO, you can lay this at Ailes and Prebius front door.</comment>

<comment>Alas, poor Cruz and Rubio. If only they could agree to work together constructively instead of selfishly and myopically pursuing only their individual short-term interests, defined in the narrowest possible terms, they might actually be able to survive. . . but then again, if they thought like that, they'd be Democrats.</comment>

<comment>What's the spread on tonight's ugliness, more or less than the last debate.</comment>

<comment>I don't think they'll disappoint.</comment>

<comment>Almond butter is nice.</comment>

<comment>I'm out of popcorn ether way. Darn it.</comment>

<comment>Another debate tonight? What more could these guys say?</comment>

<comment>Our weekly mass murder....just in time for the debate. No doubt they will talk about it... right?Yeah, right.  But of course they will whine about illegal immigrants and fear-monger over "terrorists".Three or four people killed in shooting at Kansas company, up to 20 wounded; gunman shot dead</comment>

<comment>Lawn care company employee? I'm guessing Mexican.</comment>

<comment>Yes, of course you are.</comment>

<comment>Would you pay a White minimum wage to cut your grass when a Mexican will do it for half of that? I certainly don't.</comment>

<comment>You are embarrassing yourself with your ignorant statements. How about reading the story.</comment>

<comment>I cut my own grass.</comment>

<comment>What's there to talk about?"Condolences to those in Kansas." The end.</comment>

<comment>Well, what is there for Republicans to whine about immigration? Or Terrorism? Or Obamacare.</comment>

<comment>Not much..."Build a wall! GAH! 'Merica!"</comment>

<comment>Less than 10 minutes and counting. I bet two candidates die tonight.</comment>

<comment>Someone has come forward to fund Kasich because he would've quit like Jeb Bush did since Kasich does not have the money.Is it the Establishment Mobsters at work?Carson is still in because he still has 4 million dollars left and he said he will stay in til the end.Cruz and Rubio are sending out more begging letters than anyone can count and their wives are too and this poster wishes they would stop and do their own business - like take out a loan for heaven's sake.Trump has some Congressional (yikes! Establishment!) endorsements now.That's nice but he really doesn't need them since he significantly did quite well without them, and ironically those who had them, Cruz and Rubio, did poorly with them.All the big power wheels are trying to roll over Trump, Mitt is the latest and Rubio is attacking Trump by name in his ads.It's kinda sickening to see grown men wanting to be commander in chief of the nation's military and armory acting like sniveling little bullies to take on Trump.Would expect Texas to go for Cruz but one poll still has them in a tie while in others Cruz is 'rolling' over Trump.The Dallas Debate should be interesting.</comment>

<comment>Trump could always let Texans know that Cruz is only using them.And he could do it.New Yorkers hate Cruz for denigrating them but Texas doesn't hate Trump.</comment>

<comment>Trump is not going to be the republican party nominee, any more than Sanders is going to be the Dems' nominee. Trump will get to the convention with a large share of delegates but not enough to put him over the top. Eventually all of the non-Trump forces will coalesce around someone (probably Rubio) and Trump mania will become a footnote.</comment>

<comment>You must be a paid GOP consultant.  </comment>

<comment>I wish.</comment>

<comment>Another mass gun murder in less than a week.Just who is organizing and regulating this militia of murders? Whoever it is should be fired.</comment>

<comment>Kasich and Carson should not be in debate......</comment>

<comment>Carson should not be.  Kasich should be.  The polls showing him beating Hillary far more easily than any other candidate.</comment>
