<comment>Reciprocity for concealed carry permits is about as far removed from crime prevention as gun laws can be - every statistic out there shows that the people obtaining concealed carry permits are, on average, more law abiding than other civilians and less likely to commit any types of crime. They're not the problem, and denying them the ability to carry in a state only advances an anti-gun agenda, not a pro-safety one.</comment>

<comment>“statistic out there shows that the people obtaining concealed carry permits are, on average, more law abiding than other civilians and less likely to commit any types of crime."I am going to assume for the sake of argument that this is correct. Nonetheless, is this the proper comparison? The relevant group is not all holders of concealed permits, but rather the small subset of permit holders who have permits from other states but would have been denied permits in VA. I am not grinding any ax on the wider gun debate. It may be that this subset are also relatively law abiding. It may not. I would be surprised if there is data one way or the other.</comment>

<comment>Concealed carry permit holders must pass a background check with submitted fingerprints,  pass an all day class on the law, verbal conflict resolution, exhibit the ability to accurately hit the target and pass a written exam.In Florida the crime rate among the 1.3 million permit holders is 0.02%.People that get a CHL do not break laws.I have permits from 4 states that by reciprocity make me legal in 39 states.  People like me are not the problem</comment>

<comment>That is interesting, but it is not a response to my point. You essentially repeat the same statistical argument whose relevancy I questioned.</comment>

<comment>You have no point!</comment>

<comment>You speak like a Mensan. Plenty of noise  but nothing to really say.</comment>

<comment>In Texas the class is 4 hours long, with a test designed so no one can fail (that's true in most states actually). And the .02% you cited is not the crime rate, it is the CONVICTION rate. Totally different animal. An analysis of crime by Texans points out that while CHLs do have a lower rate of crime generally (THANKS TO BACKGROUND CHECKS WHICH SCREEN OUT FELONS AND VIOLENT MISDEMEANANTS), when they are convicted it tends to be for crimes on the more violent end of the spectrum.</comment>

<comment>"And the .02% you cited is not the crime rate, it is the CONVICTION rate"CONVICTIONS are the only measure that can be relied upon. Arrests are at the whim of the police. But feel free to compare the TX CHL CONVICTION rate with that of the regular populus. The numbers are right there on the TX Dept of Safety web site/\" when they are convicted it tends to be for crimes on the more violent end of the spectrum."Numbers too small to be statistically meaningful.</comment>

<comment>Logical fallacy.  I call that  a distortion of the truth.  So you want to count  ALL prosecutions that go no where. Intellectually dishonest.</comment>

<comment>If it was due to background checks, why is the crime rate lower for concealed carriers than for cops?</comment>

<comment>What about the Oregon stand off...?</comment>

<comment>red herring.</comment>

<comment>You submitted fingerprints to exercise a Constitutional right? Move to a free State that doesn't require that.  Like Alaska.</comment>

<comment>Wyoming, too.</comment>

<comment>Stripping reciprocity didn't only affect the people who wouldn't have qualified under VA laws - it affected everyone from that state. So while 99% of Ohioans, for example, would easily be granted a VA permit, 100% of them would be forbidden to carry. It's using an extraordinarily broad brush that lacked any data whatsoever - the AG presented zero evidence that any out-of-state licensees were creating an issue at all.</comment>

<comment>Are you saying that an OH resident could not also obtain a VA permit?</comment>

<comment>I do believe that VA issues non-resident permits. This would require at the very least an additional fee, and perhaps training/background checks. However, if this were the model, law-abiding citizens who regularly cross borders of more than a handful of states would incur hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in fees to repeat more or less same process.These reciprocity agreements are much the same as the massive drivers' license compact - though training/licensure may differ, license holders agree to follow local laws regardless of their state of origin.In the case of gun permits, I'm yet to see a single state who has reported any notable amount of crime attributable to "lower" qualification standards in neighboring/reciprocal states - it's very fair to accuse VA's AG/governor of posturing and pandering since they presented no evidence that they were solving a problem that actually existed.</comment>

<comment>Thank you.The imposition of cost and inconvenience is certainly an argument on the pro-reciprocity side, but not the one I was commenting on. As for states attributing crime to lower standards in other states, it may be because the data would show no such effect, but it could be that the data does not exist but might show some effect. I take no position on that except to say that without such evidence a conclusion in any direction is speculation.(I have also certainly seen allegations that laxer gun laws generally, not permitting laws specifically, have led to crime in neighboring states.)</comment>

<comment>I agree that data on carriers in neighboring states is going to be rare, and even then it's a relatively small population - I'd ultimately point you to broad statistics on concealed carriers state by state, which without exception shows that no matter how lax the licensing requirements, people who go to the trouble of obtaining a license to carry are some of the least likely people to commit crimes of any sort.I'm always intrigued by research on the "laxer gun laws in neighboring states" theory. I think that proving any sort of causation in those studies is near to impossible. Most studies I've found suggest that the  biggest sources of guns used in crimes aren't traditional sales through regulated dealers, though - they're "straw purchases" (a legal buyer illegally buys on behalf of a prohibited person) or person-to-person sales from a friend or relative who is not required to perform any kind of check (or who isn't inclined to even if legally required).Gun laws really can't affect either source (unfortunately), unless you believe that Universal Background Check laws scare people providing guns to criminals enough to modify behavior. I'm yet to see convincing evidence of that, though, seeing as straw purchases are already a federal crime and still a booming industry.It's my general observation that tight controls on regulated items/substances - booze in the 20s, the modern "war on drugs," etc. - very rarely reduce criminals' abilities to get them; the rum-runners and El Chapo certainly prove the rule. There's always a border somewhere across which rules are different, whether it's state or national, and certain people historically have always exploited it one way or another.</comment>

<comment>”I'd ultimately point you to broad statistics on concealed carriers state by state, which without exception shows that no matter how lax the licensing requirements, people who go to the trouble of obtaining a license to carry are some of the least likely people to commit crimes of any sort.”Can you truly not see how, as I stated in my original post, this is not the relevant statistic? Within this overall law-abiding group, there is a less law-abiding subset. I only say that without the data that you admit may be nonexistent and difficult to obtain, it is possible that the VA system does a better job of excluding this subset. You give arguments to suggest that this is not the case, and I am not unpersuaded by them. But those arguments are inferential; I can't know and neither can you.</comment>

<comment>The analysis isn't hard - identify key differences between VA's process and the "lesser qualification" states - you'd see a subset of people who (as examples), might have 4-8 hours fewer training, a different type of background check, or who didn't require an in-person interview. Saying that subset is even *plausibly* less law abiding puts more faith in any of the screening measures than I have.</comment>

<comment>It’s the absolute certainty that I find maddening. I have no “faith” in screening measures. Faith would be saying that I knew what is not known.</comment>

<comment>Your argument is based on collective guilt, which has been dismissed  as legal  nonsense, but you insist on its' validity. It is also  an assumption of significance base on distortion and your own hysteria. You approve of restricting civil rights based on what you admit is only a possibility.</comment>

<comment>You do not know what I approve of because I never said. I said you had a good argument on your side, as a matter of fact.</comment>

<comment>Your argument is just playing with words, an intellectual  fancy. You stick to your Guns, as it were, and defend a loss of freedom. That is the bottom line.</comment>

<comment>That would be false.  Places like Chicago.claim that all the time.  Forgetting all citizens and FFLs fall under Federal law.  An Illinois resident can't just drive to Indiana and buy and take home a handgun.  One, the FFL still must run an NICS background.  Two, when the see the Illinois ID they will request and verify a valid FFL in Illinois to ship the gun to.  The Illinois FFL will then run a second NICS and abide by Illinois laws as applicable</comment>

<comment>What would be false? I have no idea how the above related to any of what I said. Or what FFL stands for. (Okay; federal firearms license; I looked it up.) Was that meant to reply to someone else?</comment>

<comment>(I have also certainly seen allegations that laxer gun laws generally, not permitting laws specifically, have led to crime in neighboring states.)</comment>

<comment>My point was that the allegations exist, not that I agree with them. I was responding to E.A.’s saying that he had yet to see a state that had reported crime attributable to lower permitting standards in neighboring states. None of what I said is about my personal opinion of gun control laws generally or VA laws specifically. I would have never made such a sloppy argument as “seen allegations” if I were actually trying to prove the truth of those allegations.</comment>

<comment>Your lack of logic is depressing. I call you on being intellectually dishonest.</comment>

<comment>Faulty logic. The fact is, the state passed a law that is without merit.</comment>

<comment>nonsense.   You speak like a Mensan, and I do not mean that in a good way. You have conviction but your reasoning is for sh8t.</comment>

<comment>No he stood down from violating civil rights.</comment>

<comment>McAuliffe realized he had stirred up a hornet's nest. Republicans in the legislature were ready to go to war with McAuliffe over the reciprocity issue - an issue very important to gun owners.McAuliffe decided he didn't want to have an openly hostile legislature for the remainder of his term, and folded like a cheap suit.</comment>

<comment>"the reciprocity issue - an issue very important to gun owners"Help us understand why that is?  I mean, there's clearly no unfettered right to carry a concealed weapon on one's person at all times and in all places.  So why is it such a big deal that one be allowed to hide a gun in their cargo shorts' waistband while sitting on a Virginia beach?  Are they that riddled with anxiety?  Is it a hero complex/self-worth issue?I sometimes wonder if the most ardent gun advocates recognize the psychological divide they have with those of us who see no problems with reasonable firearms restrictions.(Why do I have a sneaking suspicion that we're about to see various versions of slippery slope notions?)</comment>

<comment>What's your problem with these people carrying their guns as they wish?They've never been a threat to the public in any way so why place restrictions on them?</comment>

<comment>I got over the gun thing after I had to use weapons as tools in the 60's. I guess some people just haven't had to grow up.Everybody is a safe gun user until they shoot someone in the theater, get drunk or get pisse d off at their old lady. The simple fact is that carrying a gun is dangerous to you and those around you. The number of people harmed by accidental discharges vastly exceeds those very few  occasions when guns are succesfully used for protection.  Think about it, your talking about people who watch duck dynasty being able to carry guns while they drink.</comment>

<comment>Your snide remark about Duck Dynasty says more about you than it does about your intended target.</comment>

<comment>Good luck getting one.  The comment was an emotional outburst, nothing more.  JB is more likely to suffer at the hands of an unqualified driver than a CCL holder.</comment>

<comment>We are all more likely to die in car crashes than by firearms. But we do have a complex system of rules, licenses, insurance, and enforcement to try and make driving safer.</comment>

<comment>I only counted 4 untruths in his comment. How about you?</comment>

<comment>What you're (not your or yore) unable to understand is that legal gun owners are not shooting up theaters, shooting their wives or anyone else around them. I know for certain accidental discharges are not anywhere close to the number of times guns save lives, and so would you if you cared to look in to it in the slightest.And Duck Dynasty has absolutely nothing to do with gun ownership tho I did watch a couple episodes a few years back. Was I wrong not to drink while doing so?</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you're projecting.</comment>

<comment>Lol. We're did you get your stats.  MSNBC? Accidental deaths are less than 600 a year. Out of about 300,000,000 firearms in the country. On the other hand people using firearms to defend themselves are in the 100s of thousands a year... According to the CDC and FBI statistics. Before ranting unfounded comments, why don't you educate yourself on the topic first? Some may think you are uneducated by not doing so.</comment>

<comment>And how many of the 600 involve legal gun owners in the first place?</comment>

<comment>They were Accidental deaths. Mix of everything. </comment>

<comment>I would bet a majority of accidents involve illegal guns. Gang members handling guns like they see in the movies and accidentally shooting themselves because they put a pistol in condition one with the safety off in their waistband. </comment>

<comment>Yeap. Got a point there.</comment>

<comment>Nope, you twisted what jb said... He said ...harmed by accidental discharge. Think Dick Cheney</comment>

<comment>Is that meant as a  criticism, or as a supportive statement?  It is unclear to me.</comment>

<comment>Supporting. Not only is the number low but most are people without legal guns in the first place. Accidents correlate with homicides and assault. A few exceedingly bad urban areas in an otherwise perfectly fine country.</comment>

<comment>Your  comments are nothing but emotions, and your comments are meant to be dismissive. Your   assertions about  defensive gun use are without merit.

That is only a value judgment that is meaningless.</comment>

<comment>I guess you missed the 2nd Amendment.  Please read it out loud.</comment>

<comment>"Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited. . . . [T]he right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose . . . .  [P]rohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogues. . . .  [N]othing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms."  (citations omitted)</comment>

<comment>With respect to SCOTUS rhetoric, that's not what the 2nd Amendment says.  Read it again.  Eventually, unfettered self-defense will be tested by a leftist government and we may have to start over.  In the mean time, disarmed citizens will be mere subjects and victims.</comment>

<comment>Well, Justice Robert Jackson said of his colleagues that they are not final because they are infallible.  The Court is "infallible" because it is final.</comment>

<comment>just remember - the First Amendment is not unlimitedThat is how the european idiots think - they get thrown in jail for saying things.</comment>

<comment>Look at the application of Political Correctness, like many Universities. Just sad.  The progressive libs do not want an educated or armed population, They want to be a new  aristocracy</comment>

<comment>Just laughable. In the mid 1700s the private ownership of cannon  was uncommon, limited to those who could afford to  buy and feed them, or to towns and villages as common holdings. Yes, the 2d is indeed limited. You just support any and all further limitations on it. Or am I mistaken?</comment>

<comment>Those were Scalia's words.</comment>

<comment>Of course you are mistaken. Almost every one of your comments seems just intended to annoy. You don’t actually explain why the person is wrong, and in this case and others you make assumptions about what the other person thinks based on a narrow comment, in this case simply a quote. It is possible to support some gun laws and not others. Notice that I'm not saying what I support. I just think your comments are kind of spammy.</comment>

<comment>I am not asked to support my arguments, so I feel no need to preach. I just call people on bad logic, false facts, and emotional arguments.  If that is inadequate to make people to think for themselves, they are a lost cause. I do indeed base my criticisms on what people say.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It is the "  for other purposes" that scares me.</comment>

<comment>My reading of the bill has been cursory.  What specific section(s) effectuate or require confiscation?</comment>

<comment>" fpr other purposes" is a weasel term that   could mean anything that antigunners  want it to.</comment>

<comment>Now that you have made a non-germane editorial comment, can you answer my question?</comment>

<comment>Not germane?  Just because you said so?   HA! I answered your question. You just  seem to have trouble with my answer.</comment>

<comment>You did not.  What specific section(s) of the bill to which Wyre Paladin linked effectuate or require confiscation?"I don't know" is an appropriate answer if it is true.</comment>

<comment>"For Other Purposes."  that can be determined ad lib at any point in the future.</comment>

<comment>What section(s) or subsection(s), doofus?  Those paragraphs have numbers and letters for a reason.</comment>

<comment>"allows"   "for other purposes," to be determined later, That is just dangerous .</comment>

<comment>Uh, this is a two step process.Step one:  Read the damned text of the bill.Step two:  Answer my question.  What specific section(s) of the bill effectuate or require confiscation?</comment>

<comment>Go read it yourself. Your logical fallacy is an appeal to minutia, and ignore the presented fact.   I will not let you try to control the discussion with  getting away from the point. I notice you choose to not deny what the bill says. That is  intellectually dishonest on your part. Deflection is neither logical nor acceptable behavior. In any class on logic or debate you would fail.</comment>

<comment>IOW, you don't have a clue what you are talking about, and/or you are too dumb or lazy to read past the caption.How does one "deny what the bill says"?  Those of us in what Karl Rove referred to as "the reality-based community" don't roll that way.Upon reading the bill, I did not see anything which effectuates or requires confiscation of any firearm(s).  Hence my question about whether I am missing something.Let me suggest a three step process:Step one: Read the text of the bill.  (That means the part below the caption.)Step two:  Stop pissing your pants.Step three: Answer my question. What specific section(s) of the bill effectuate or require confiscation?</comment>

<comment>first of all, stick with logic and facts. Your   insults and personal attacks lend no validity to anything you say. I don't like or respect your way of   arguing, It reflects poorly on you . I explained that weasel terms   leave the bill open to later   abuse.</comment>

<comment>Have you even read the bill?EDIT:  How long does it take to answer a simple yes or no question?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I have. On a  gun site.</comment>

<comment>Then please explain what language in the bill requires confiscation.</comment>

<comment>Your sophistry is  regrettable.  I say again, it would allow  confiscation, not requires it  AT THIS TIME.</comment>

<comment>What language in the bill, as drafted, allows confiscation? Please be specific.I will help you out here.  The word "allow" appears once in the bill.  Subsection 2(b)(47) states, "The term ‘threaded barrel’ means a feature or characteristic that is designed in such a manner to allow for the attachment of a device such as a firearm silencer or a flash suppressor."The words "confiscate" and "confiscation" appear nowhere.Are you waiting for someone to tell you how to respond?Is the language hiding somewhere next to Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?Did Santa Claus take the language back with him to his workshop at the North Pole?</comment>

<comment>Possibly it is due to the fact that you are engaging in a false comparison. This is not about ''cargo shorts'' or ''Va Beach''. It is about the ability to transport a weapon legally purchased by a licenced and law-abiding gun owner through another state, or retain it while on all from a visit or vacation, to a move to another state, without fear of arrest or the imprisonment that can and does accompany such weapons transfers across state lines.                             Foolishly, liberals, who demanded reciprocity from all from gay marriage [ before its decision at the national level by the USSC ], to legalized marijuana and abortion, would deny it simply based on their own gun hangups which illogically and always, begin with ''NRA'' instead of finding ways to deny thugs these weapons beyond slapping them on the wrist and turning them loose back into society.                             Liberals lose their argument because they go after the law-abiding and not the criminal, whom they could care less about where reducing their numbers is concerned.</comment>

<comment>Foolishly conservatives are often not as supportive of gun rights either.</comment>

<comment>Do crimes not happen on a beach in Virginia?</comment>

<comment>Since Obama took office the criminals have gotten more bold.</comment>

<comment>William, I am Not PC. I sincerely believe that divisiveness and fracturing of the social bonds of the US that have held us together have been  supported and encouraged in the last 7 years.</comment>

<comment>This is me, laughing at you.  State some "reasonable " firearms restrictions that do not have the possibility of  evolving into abuses.</comment>

<comment>All things "have the possibility of evolving into abuses."  Whether they are rights or regulations.  We can't employ such a litmus for determining what we can do or what we can have.  If we did, we'd be forced to the inevitable conclusion that no rights can exist.There's a reason the slippery slope was long ago acknowledged to be logically fallacious.</comment>

<comment>Slippery slope is a logical fallacy?  Based on what exactly? I disagree. Just like the  "domino theory"  it has been demonstrated to be true.</comment>

<comment>Whether a slippery slope argument can be considered fallacious depends on the circumstances and whether or not an individual making such an argument can demonstrate a process that leads to the asserted effect, and when they can, it is not "logically fallacious". With gun-control, the slippery slope argument is not fallacious at all, since we can clearly see both a historical pattern of ever increasing restrictions, as well as a corresponding increase in the pattern of abuses by the state, hence, such an argument is entirely logically consistent with the facts in this case.As to the intellectual concept of individual rights, the exercise of a right is considered valid, so long as the rights of other individuals are not violated, and obviously, the act of a person who uses a firearm to injure or kill another individual is a violation of that individual's rights, unless it is a case of self-defense, which is actually the defense of the rights of that person. Simply owning a firearm, or even carrying one into public spaces where an individual has a right to be, in no way violates the rights of any other person.Now an argument can be made about limiting the rights of specific individuals, as we do with violent offenders who have demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to live peacefully within society, since the best predictor of future behavior, is past behavior, however when the gov't can step in and arbitrarily limit magazine capacity, barrel length, or decide what kind of stock or other things may be attached to a firearm, or dictate how much ammunition may be inserted into a "clip", as a few State governments have done, that is a clear violation of an individual rights, and one that serves no legitimate function, and represents in part, that pattern of abuses of which I spoke.In the end, when the sum total of the history and efforts of gun-control organizations are objectively analyzed, one invariably comes to the conclusion that they are engaging in a strategy of incremental restrictions, ultimately leading to the criminalization of virtually all private ownership of firearms. In fact, in the 1960-70s, gun control organizations were remarkably honest about these goals, but they woefully underestimated their opposition, and in the decades that have followed, they have changed their tactics to those of a deceptive nature, by paying lip service to the 2A, and professing "support" for gun ownership, while they actually work to undermine it, and their actions belie the truth that their end goals are still the same.Lastly, and once again, the best predictor of future behavior, is past behavior.</comment>

<comment>"With gun-control, the slippery slope argument is not fallacious at all, since we can clearly see both a historical pattern of ever increasing restrictions, as well as a corresponding increase in the pattern of abuses by the state, hence, such an argument is entirely logically consistent with the facts in this case."That's demonstrably incorrect.  The protections of the Second Amendment are stronger and broader today then at any time in US history.  Any pattern to which you're pointing was ended in 2008.  The reason your gun rights advocates attempt to paint an opposite picture is that the majority of the Heller Court was tenuous and it's 5-4 decision remains susceptible to being reversed.As to your view of the slippery slope, let's apply it to your basic premise, ad see the nonsensical places to which we might proceed.  For example, if "the best predictor of future behavior, is past behavior,"* than it would follow that we should expand the scope of background checks.  I mean, just because someone has never been convicted of a violent felony, it doesn't mean they haven't engaged in violent "past behavior".  Consequently, as we slide down that gradient, we come to having to foreclose the gun ownership rights of everyone who's ever been in a fight, fired from a job for a violent outburst, been penalized for unnecessary roughness in a high school football game.  It's a silly argument that inevitably leads to illogical results.What you're pining for is a way to filter reason through belief to accept an argument's validity.  This is not, however, what we call logic, it goes to persuasiveness.  If you believe it's reasonable to assume that all other people want to take your bullets, than it's reasonable for you to assume that motivation when assessing the merits of the slippery slope objection.  Trump's Great Wall of Texas idea is a fine example of an idea that lacks logic, but is considerably persuasive to some - since they believe that there is some kind of invasion occurring that is responsible for the number of undocumented foreigners in the US.As to the "pattern of abuses by the state . . . [and] the facts in this case," the instant matter involves reciprocity for concealed carry.  Neither the Heller nor the Miller Courts ever held that denying reciprocity rights ran afoul of the Second Amendment - it's not abusive.  Many states continue to maintain such laws, to no harm.  Once again, you're doing nothing more than falling back on fears that can be created by whining about bad traction on a hill.* It's worth noting that your premise also commits the composition fallacy.  You assume that you can take the motivation of an individual and assign it to the whole.  Moreover, you assume that the motivations of one organization applies to all and that a motivation of a group at one point in time is the motivation of that group decades later.  As to the last point, the NRA provides a fine example for an organized group whose motivations have "evolved" over time.</comment>

<comment>"That's demonstrably incorrect.  The protections of the Second Amendment are stronger and broader today then at any time in US history......Heller Court was tenuous and it's 5-4 decision remains susceptible to being reversed.....As to the "pattern of abuses by the state "You seem to be contradicting yourself here. Are the protections of the 2A stronger, or is the decision in danger of being reversed? And if Heller represents a strengthening of individual rights, then we shouldn't be seeing states like NY, and CT prohibiting semi-automatic rifles and carbines, or dictating what configuration they can be owned in like CA does, since they are "commonly owned", and states like NY (again) and NJ, have permit requirements that are so restrictive, that one must be wealthy, or politically influential to obtain them, and cities like Chicago have such onerous restrictions in place, designed to discourage FFL dealers, and owners from operating within city, so you have not demonstrated anything to be incorrect. "...fired from a job for a violent outburst, been penalized for unnecessary roughness in a high school football game.  It's a silly argument that inevitably leads to illogical results."I would have thought it obvious that I was talking about crimes of violence, especially those involving a firearm. What constitutes a "violent outburst" at a workplace, yelling, screaming, throwing a tangent? Football is a contact sport, and one that is voluntarily played, and individuals who play it, presumably know this.  What you're doing here is either misunderstanding, or intentionally engaging in a sophist argument."It's worth noting that your premise also commits the composition fallacy.  You assume that you can take the motivation of an individual and assign it to the whole.Sorry, but actions speak louder then words. What we see from gun-control organizations fits precisely into their stated desires from the past. For example, gun-control orgs have been pressing for universal BG checks in the last few years, and yet, without a registration scheme, such UBCs are not viable like they are with commercial dealers, and registration is a long sought after goal by GC orgs. GC orgs have previously stood in the way of RTC permits, which now exist in all 50 states, and each time they came in with chicken little style "the sky is falling" or there will be "blood in the streets" arguments, that never materialize. They pursue ridiculous state sponsored, and mandated impractical measures like micro-stamping, or "smart guns", and call for UBCs as a means of combating mass shootings, even though most such individuals undergo, and pass a BG check before they go on their rampage.They pursued lawsuits against manufactures for the criminal actions of third parties before the PLCAA put an end to their abuses. They seek to arbitrary place limitations on magazines, and the aforementioned semi-automatic rifles, supposedly to fight crime, and yet such rifles are only used in 2-3% of crimes involving a firearm. These organizations are either populated by incredibly stupid people, which I can't discount the strong possibility of, or they are working hard to attack privately owned firearms wherever and whenever they can, and perhaps both.</comment>

<comment>Upon reflection, I would like to compare the state of gun ownership and right to carry today versus   let's say 1964. I can recognize the antigun denial of  of the slippery slope argument because they want everyone to believe that has been no individual loss of rights since then... Yeah,right. They choose to ignore reality. The big lie in use again.</comment>

<comment>Just casuistic  nonsense. You do not even demonstrate  the ability to avoid internal contradictions in your statements.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, McAuliffe has now drawn the "wrath" of Michael "guns for me, but not for thee" Bloomberg. I swear, I wonder if Bloomberg is actually a closeted gun-rights supporter since his best efforts usually blow up in his face, Acme Rocket style.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Perhaps reciprocity for states with qualifying standards greater than - or equal to - Virginia is fair.But laws "laxer than its own" is problematic. Virginia is creating a loophole to its own standards for CCW. That's risky depending on who's carrying from what state. It also cheapens the process for Virginia residents who are held to higher standards.Meanwhile, the NRA is pushing bills to proliferate firearms access. Herein lies another slippery slope. They are quick to argue the incrementalism of gun control advocates, but fail to see it on their own side.I won't call it hypocrisy just yet. But be honest about what the real agenda is, and whether those with opposing views are completely unreasonable in their suspicions and legitimate concerns.</comment>

<comment>That is the unfortunate truth. Whenever an inch is given a mile is taken.</comment>

<comment>Then why all the fuss about measures short of confiscation?</comment>

<comment>That gun owners made concessions at all shows that the  gun control enthusiasts  won.All compromises do is make both sides demand more, and gun owners have given in a lot over the years, and what have they gotten in return?  Demands for more concessions.</comment>

<comment>kevin, antigunners will never stop. They will never rest, they will always demand more restrictions, and they will compromise on nothing that they have gained.</comment>

<comment>McAuliffe blinked and we're supposed to be pleased? OK maybe we are, just a little bit. But I would have preferred that Virginia keep its stupid law and suffer the consequences.  Consequences are more effective than deal making.</comment>

<comment>The compromise probably makes Virginians safer than the original proposal, although neither probably will have much effect.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. How many CC people from other states are passing through, and how many of *those* are going to commit a crime? As much noise as the announcement made, ending reciprocity was going to have near zero effect.</comment>

<comment>It would have the intended effect - punishing gun owners (the inconvenience of making it illegal to carry in VA) for being on the "wrong" side of one of McAuliffe's pet issues. It was never about safety, but about personal and political posturing.</comment>

<comment>I'm very pro-gun and as such I believe that anyone who owns a gun should take it upon themselves to learn how to safely carry, use and store their weapon(s). I may part ways with my gun-loving brothers and sisters when I say a licensing process is not an entirely bad idea. Currently, a CHL is the closest we get to that idea and what the gun grabbers need to understand is that someone who goes willingly through the CHL process is as safe and responsible as a gun owner can possibly be.</comment>

<comment>Good for you.  Some sanity is all anyone is asking for.</comment>

<comment>i agree completely</comment>

<comment>Craven cowards who are more concerned about their politcal campaign coffers than the lives of innocents.

I hope the voters of Virginia oust him for his betrayal.</comment>

<comment>About 99.9% of gun owners are innocents.</comment>

<comment>Great.  Then they should be lobbying the NRA to keep the crazies from making responsible gun owners look bad.</comment>

<comment>Sadly we gun owners, and gun rights organizations spend most of our time and treasure fighting off those that want to punish the innocent.Best to focus on punishing the guilty.The good news is that we have a lot more guns, almost 200 million this century ---using NICS checks as a proxy for gun sales https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/c...   Plus violent crime is way down, even though we have more guns in circulation.</comment>

<comment>Wyre, am I the only one that sees the hypocrisy of owning guns, and wanting to deny them to  others?</comment>

<comment>They do. The NRA has always pushed for mandatory jail sentences and enforcement of laws.  Democrats then turn around and set those criminals free and back on the street to keep killing. Then democrats go at it again asking for more gun control. Vicious circle</comment>

<comment>Only 30% of the time though</comment>

<comment>99.9% are innocent 100% of the time.</comment>

<comment>The same bogus predictions have been made  by antigunners about any   recognition of citizens    civil rights. They have never been right. Your hysteria and histrionics have no bearing on reality, as demonstrated by   a number of states that have  legalized carry.</comment>

<comment>Anything that makes it harder for domestic abusers to get guns is a good thing. That's one of my biggest beefs with NRA - they actually try to protect the gun "rights" of domestic abusers! That and allowing those on no-fly list to buy guns. If the problem is people not guns, let's focus on the people.</comment>

<comment>You are not being honest here. [liberals rarely are when the discussion turns to guns ].The NRA has no problem with the denial of weapons to CONVICTED domestic abusers. This is a far cry from ACCUSED domestic abusers who , under due process, have the right to see their guilt or innocence that would either allow or deny their gun rights, heard by a court.                                   This is the same sort of Kafkaesque crap being peddled in liberal states such as California. While being merely accused of a crime [ and especially with hate crimes, and those of rape, how many of these have ended up being false allegations? ] you are stripped of your gun rights and there is no quick or sudden re-establishment of these now-abridged 2nd Amendment rights but a long and red-tape-strewn road in getting them restored.                                     That state does not stop there. You can be accused of a mental illness by even a family member [ a bill to include ''co-workers'' was stalled by a lineup of what few moderate Democrats and Republicans the state even has left ], which allows police to strip you of your 2nd rights even without the findings of an expert physician qualified as a mental health professional. It is a hysterical attempt to deny guns to the law abiding who have not been found guilty of having committed any crime, or suffer any debilitating mental condition. Upon this then, does the NRA oppose such tactics used by liberal blue states.</comment>

<comment>You are dishonest.</comment>

<comment>Dishonest like a fox</comment>

<comment>Essentially you are arguing we should ban alcohol, because that would keep alcohol out of the hands of drunk drivers.  Punishing the innocent because of a few bad actors has never been a good basis for law.</comment>

<comment>Yes it is That is why we have laws in the first place. Otherwise we wouldn't have stop signs, speed limits, and so on. The vast majority of people don't break the law, yet, we all are "punished" by the misdeeds of the few. To think otherwise is to be completely blind to logic.</comment>

<comment>Laws are supposed to only punish those that break them, not everyone.  How many times have you been put in prison for killing someone, even though you are innocent?</comment>

<comment>the Teddy Kennedy no-fly list ?</comment>

<comment>Probably not, given that he's dead and all.</comment>

<comment>And who decides who is an "abuser?"</comment>

<comment>The courts.</comment>

<comment>You mean courts that hand out restraining orders as a pro forma part of any divorce?</comment>

<comment>That kind of ex parte order does not disqualify someone for purposes of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g).  The relevant prohibition there is possession of a firearm by a person:</comment>

<comment>Yep. Better safe than sorry.</comment>

<comment>That's the foolish thinking that created kangaroo courts on college campuses and has the TSA feeling up little girls.</comment>

<comment>You are on the THOUGHT POLICE watch list.  Persist, and be taken to REEDUCATION camp.</comment>

<comment>Can you prove that the NRA protects domestic abusers?  I am an NRA member and know of no such stance.  I do know that the NRA protects you.  You are too certain you will never be in an awkward or compromising situation.  You are too certain you will never have your rights trampled by an accusation.  The NRA is protecting your right to be assured innocence until proven guilty is a truism for everyone.Oh, and the "no-fly list" is a list compiled by bureaucratic agencies without any recourse for those placed on the list.  No proof is needed and there an arduous process to reestablish one's right when erroneously identified.  Folks who believe in the accuracy of a "no fly list" will be the ones who who falsely accuse a neigbor of  being an abuser.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, people who are on a secret government list compiled with no published criteria, no legal oversight, and no clear way to get off should be prohibited from exercising a constitutional right!That's liberal logic for you.I wonder what other rights we should delete from people's lives based on a secret government list.  How about the right to an attorney?  The right to face your accuser?  The right to a trial?Man, I guess Gitmo wasn't that bad of an idea after all!</comment>

<comment>Your beef with the NRA is based on illogic.  I am opposed to any  violation of due process. I am also opposed to  secret no-fly lists  with no   way to file grievances.</comment>

<comment>The usual responses from Atlantic Liberals who wouldn't know a muzzle from a muffler.</comment>

<comment>Many of us "Atlantic Liberals" are proud gun owners.   Nationally about 23% of liberals own guns, compared to merely 41% of conservatives. http://www.pewresearch.org/fac...  The numbers are not as skewed as mush as you think they are.You don't do yourself any favors by alienating your "friends".  You and I need to be hammering the gun grabbers, no matter if they are liberal or conservative.</comment>

<comment>They are never conservative.</comment>

<comment>Denial is not only a river in Egypt.</comment>

<comment>I have no idea what that is a reference to, but gun grabbers are always POS libs.</comment>

<comment>That would be the equivalent of saying Liberals are the ones who always support gun rights, in other words, using the word always makes it a lie.</comment>

<comment>It works for me</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your support, Kevin.</comment>

<comment>Supporters of gun control don't do themselves any favors when they issue such ridiculous, melodramatic statements (e.g. "He has basically rolled out a welcome mat for people who are armed and dangerous").</comment>

<comment>What a false headline.  The governor had a huge back lash from the people of the state.</comment>

<comment>The history and culture of gun ownership in America is too strong. The gun grabbers should just give up before they end up looking weak like this governor who was forced to backtrack on his word.</comment>

<comment>This article and the reaction to this deal don't begin to reflect reality. Without reciprocity, a law abiding gun owner with a concealed carry permit from another state could be arrested even if he/she is simply driving through Virginia.  While I am very in favor of meaningful gun-reform, the reciprocity issue did nothing to increase public safety - people who get concealed carry permits are basically vetted, law abiding citizens.What is missed in all of this talk is how for the first time, the NRA capitulated in their fight to not take guns away from anyone - that is a huge sign that momentum is on the side of gun-control advocates.  The background search issue also begins to change the problem of gun-show loopholes.It isn't perfect, but change doesn't happen all at once in politics.  Progress is progress and the governor should be applauded for moving the chains forward.</comment>

<comment>I may be missing something, and there may be more than the article here describes, but how does this agreement take guns away from anyone who is lawfully entitled to possess them?</comment>

<comment>The deal would take away guns from anyone with an injunction for domestic violence in the state.  It also would allow for state police to perform background checks at gun shows - voluntarily yes, but it's something police is not allowed to do now. That may seem like a small gain to some but at least 4 murders in the state would have been prevented last year if that were previously true.It is a small step but a very real one. The deal is sensible if not revolutionary. Progress isn't usually made with dramatic leaps but rather with small but steady and achievable steps.</comment>

<comment>Those against whom a domestic violence injunction has issued (after a hearing or the opportunity for a hearing) are ineligible under federal law to possess firearms.And the refusal of a gun sale as the result of a background check doesn't take a gun away from anyone.  The prospective seller keeps possession, and the prospective buyer never obtains  possession.</comment>

<comment>Word </comment>

<comment>Great day for Liberty and a bad day for the New World Order of debt slavery and disarmed citizenry.  Fascists are crying</comment>

<comment>Legal arms ownership is not what criminals use, by and large.Based on survey data from the U.S. Department of Justice, roughly 5,340,000 violent crimes were committed in the United States during 2008. These include simple/aggravated assaults, robberies, sexual assaults, rapes, and murders.Of these, about 436,000 or 8% were committed by offenders visibly armed with a gun.http://www.justfacts.com/gunco...</comment>

<comment>"He has basically rolled out a welcome mat for people who are armed and dangerous"For the love of God, how dangerous do y'all think gun owners are??? Treating your opponents as criminals right off the bat is really a bad political strategy, let me tell ya that, "gun control" advocates. Good for McAuliffe for rolling back a bit of his ridiculous proposal, and good for virginians who have their constitutional rights less endangered as a result.</comment>

<comment>How dangerous are they? Well, they can kill you by pointing at you and tightening their index fingers. That's plenty dangerous enough for me.</comment>

<comment>Just a question...how many gun owners have you met?</comment>

<comment>Since I grew up in the South, just about everybody I have ever known was a gun owner. Most of them were okay. That doesn't means guns shouldn't be regulated.</comment>

<comment>Did you feel endangered when being around those folks? My guess is no. Because gun owners ain't dangerous as a rule. Of course there's dangerous gun owners as there is dangerous car owners. That doesn't mean they should be treated like potential murderers just for enjoying their constitutional rights.</comment>

<comment>I generally don't feel endangered around the ones I know. But there was the one who shot himself in the leg practicing his fast draw. He seemed perfectly sensible until he did that.</comment>

<comment>Well, I usually see dumbasses speeding down the road in their fast cars. Doesn't mean I immediately think car drivers are dangerous.</comment>

<comment>Oh God! Cars exist! Therefore, everybody needs a gun so that he can shoot the cars!</comment>

<comment>not true, the embarrassing and totally moronic 2nd amendment will be repealed for sure. </comment>

<comment>Ok, let me know how that works out for you never.</comment>

<comment>Too bad we can't flip this 180 and make it illegal to carry a concealed weapon.  If you want to carry a weapon it should be clearly visible as the old Willie Nelson song "Pancho and Lefty" says, "for all the honest world to see".  That would support the rights of non-owner and everyone else for matter to make personal safety decisions about their surroundings and take appropriate action.  Business would have to decide if they wanted to allow gun toting folks in their stores, restaurants whatever and the rest of us could decide if we wanted to shop among the armed or not.  Seems fair to me. When you're hiding your weapon you are depriving me of important information about my personal safety.  Anyone found with a concealed weapon would go to jail.</comment>

<comment>But if you see somebody carrying a weapon, what do you do? You don't know what he's going to do with it until he does it, and then you may be dead. That happened in Colorado not long ago. A woman saw a guy carrying a rifle and called 911. The 911 operator assured her that it was perfectly all right because Colorado has open-carry. A few minutes later, the lady called back and said the man had killed three people.With open-carry, the police can't do anything until it's too late.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps I'm slow on the uptake, but if he been hiding his weapon, I don't see how the outcome would have been any different. Three people would still be dead.</comment>

<comment>Maybe, maybe not. Killers often aren't thinking straight, and make dumb mistakes. In this case, its too easy for killers in open carry, they simply get to walk down the road with their gun hanging out, and no one knows whether its a good guy or a bad guy. A citizen never knows when to call the police or not. Its kind of hard to conceal a rifle, so he would have had to use a different weapon (which he may or not have). If you saw an adult walking towards an elementary school with a rifle would you call the police? Or how about into a crowded football stadium? Are we suppose to ignore anyone walking around with a gun? The police don't know when to show up. Before, it would have been overtime a guy is walking around with a gun, now, they have to wait for the bullets to start flying before they show up. The the new normal sure makes it hard to tell when something bad is going to happen.</comment>

<comment>Believe me. I am not in favor of open carry. Truthfully, if I saw someone carting a gun around in a store or restaurant, I'd leave immediately. But in the particular case cited above, I'm just not sure it would have made a difference, that's all.I really don't see the point of open carrying. What are you trying to prove by doing so?</comment>

<comment>Where I live, there is no rational reason for open carry. Like you, if I see a guy with a gun in Starbucks, I am taking my family and walking out. Frankly, I can't think of anywhere where open carry makes sense. In those states where open carry is happening, what would happen if every time a person was open carrying, someone called the cops. How are the cops to know, if they need to respond or not? If you work in a convenience store, doesn't an open carry guy walking in make you nervous? I have a feeling that if a bunch of black guys started open carrying in Texas, and walking into white owned establishments, people would want to rethink the law pretty damn quick.</comment>

<comment>If a black was open carrying, he'd wind up dead. Let's be real - open carry is a privilege afforded to whites only.Where I live (NJ) gun culture just isn't a thing really. One of our fiends is a hunter, but he is a bow hunter. (He kills most of their meat and they eat the whole animal. You never know what you'll be dining on if you eat there.)</comment>

<comment>Complete BS.Black people open carry in Virginia. No problem.</comment>

<comment>I'll take your word for it. Thanks for the correction.</comment>

<comment>You know what?Thanks.</comment>

<comment>Already happening.And no one cares.</comment>

<comment>Somebody could walk toward a school with three or four pistols in their jacket and do more than enough damage. And nobody would see it coming.</comment>

<comment>Yep, and that has happened. That is why this is such a difficult problem to solve. </comment>

<comment>It was a rifle.</comment>

<comment>Why is it different with concealed carry? Worse, perhaps.</comment>

<comment>Okay. Let's get rid of that. It was no-carry in Texas until 1996. That didn't cause us any problems.</comment>

<comment>And yet....open carry is common in Virginia...and nothing happens.There is always an exception.</comment>

<comment>It may be legal in Virginia, but it's not common. I've spent a lot of time there. Never saw it. By nothing happens, are you trying to say that there is NO gun violence in Virginia?</comment>

<comment>I'm saying that those that open carry, are not the ones causing the trouble. Gun crime is not usually caused by concealed carriers or those that usually open carry.There is usually an extenuating circumstance, such as other criminal involvement.</comment>

<comment>While I think open-carry is ostentatious, if that guy wanted to shoot three people and knew open-carry would cause his plans to be interrupted, he'd just have taken position on a rooftop, only carrying a violin case in the street.</comment>

<comment>Too bad we can't flip this 180 and make it legal to shoot inner city thugs on site. That would support non-thugs and everyone else to be safe.</comment>

<comment>Unless the anti gun loons can get 293 Members of the House, 67 Senators and the legislatures of 38 states to agree to repeal the 2nd Amendment, they will never get the confiscation they want.Even many Democrats would not support repeal of the 2nd Amendment.  WE THE PEOPLE are against it.</comment>

<comment>it's happening and sooner than you'd care to believe </comment>

<comment>You live in a complete fantasy world!</comment>

<comment>Licensed CHL holders are not the problem.Concealed carry permit holders must pass a background check with submitted fingerprints, pass an all day class on the law, verbal conflict resolution, exhibit the ability to accurately hit the target and pass a written exam.In Florida the crime rate among the 1.3 million permit holders is 0.02%.People that get a CHL do not break laws.I have permits from 4 states that by reciprocity make me legal in 39 states. People like me are not the problem</comment>

<comment>I notice no mention of how many gun crimes had been committed in Virginia by those who had concealed carry reciprocity.

<comment>What, exactly, does somebody need an "assault" rifle for? Hunting?</comment>

<comment>Hunting is not the point of the 2nd Amendment and "assault weapon" is a meaningless buzzword.</comment>

<comment>Assault rifle?Those are military rifles.You are attempting to use the term "assault weapon," which actually describes NO weapons, since every politician seems to make up their own definition.</comment>

<comment>If a gay couple marries in one state, is their marriage license recognized in another? Or are they charged with sodomy? Is your drivers license from Iowa recognized by the State Trooper who pulls you over for speeding in Ohio?If I have a license, issued by Maine, to carry firearms, is my license recognized three states over?If the answer to the first two questions is 'yes' how can the answer to the third question be 'no'?Neither marriage nor driving an automobile is a right recognized in the Constitution or amendments thereto.</comment>

<comment>The answer to the first question was 'not necessarily' until gay marriage became a national right which superseded state laws. Drivers licenses are recognized in all states due to reciprocity agreements. A learners permit on the other hand is not necessarily good state to state, as different states have different age requirements etc. Different states have different gun regs, hence carry laws also vary. Without debating whether or not that should be true, your example of other licenses doesn't apply here.</comment>

<comment>Because guns, marriage and cars are all different things, and need their own premises and logic.</comment>

<comment>But a government issued license is a government issued license. Not so different at all. (BTW, I'm opposed to all such that don't involve professional credentials.)</comment>

<comment>No, you have a government granted right to keep and bear arms. It is not inalienable.Go to a different country, suddenly your "inalienable" right does not exist.Should the 2nd Amendment ever be amended or repealed, you'll find your "inalienable" right gone.Inalienable, you keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm... quoting the Declaration of Independence, a wholly irrelevant document in the context of law. Yeah... you're not making the compelling point you think you are. It's also worth noting several things: 1) The Declaration of Independence referenced "inalienable rights" in relation to Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness; 2) The Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776; 3) The Bill of Rights was ratified in 1791. So... even if we (wrongly) assume the founders were speaking about the 2nd amendment when they referenced "inalienable," apparently the right became inalienable 15 years later... which leads you to the conclusion that, it's not inalienable. QED.But... seriously, go ahead and try to bring a gun to another country. When they try to take it from you, refuse, claiming that it's your "inalienable right." My guess is, you'll be jailed or shot dead (if it's the US, probably shot, any other nation will jail you).Inalienable: unable to be taken away from or given away by the possessor.If someone can deny you a gun, your right isn't inalienable. English, it's the language we've all agreed to use, let's use it correctly.</comment>

<comment>"What, then, is the law? It is the collective organization of the individual right to lawful defense. ... since an individual cannot lawfully use force against the person, liberty, or property of another individual, then the common force -- for the same reason -- cannot lawfully be used to destroy the person, liberty, or property of individual groups. ... But, unfortunately, law by no means confines itself to its proper functions. And when it has exceeded its proper functions, it has not done so merely in some inconsequential and debatable matters. The law has gone further than this; it has acted in direct opposition to its own purpose. The law has been used to destroy its own objective: It has been applied to annihilating the justice that it was supposed to maintain; to limiting and destroying rights which its real purpose was to respect. The law has placed the collective force at the disposal of the unscrupulous who wish, without risk, to exploit the person, liberty, and property of others. It has converted plunder into a right, in order to protect plunder. And it has converted lawful defense into a crime, in order to punish lawful defense." Frederick Bastiat"Of liberty I would say that, in the whole plenitude of its extent, it is unobstructed action according to our will. But rightful liberty is unobstructed action according to our will within limits drawn around us by the equal rights of others. I do not add 'within the limits of the law,' because law is often but the tyrant's will, and always so when it violates the right of an individual." Thomas JeffersonThe oath is to the Constitution, as written, not the government whose powers were limited by it. Rationalize your servitude as you wish, your choice. Many of us will not. Tyranny is what it is, whether of the minority, majority, or the "one."</comment>

<comment>It's sad that you profess to understand the law of this country yet cannot even comprehend how very wrong you are. It speaks a great deal to the severe lack of education in this country.It's sad. You're not a patriot. You're an idiot. Figure out the difference.</comment>

<comment>You appear to be confident in your willful ignorance.</comment>

<comment>Confident?  It seems as if he REVELS in his ignorance!</comment>

<comment>Nope, just confident in my ability to read and understand the law. See, I'm willing to bet you're a blue collar employee with little to no education. I have a degree in finance, a law degree, a tax LLM, I've been a federal court clerk, and in private practice. I know more law off the top of my head than you'll know in your entire life.My opinion is informed and well reasoned, yours is ignorant and pulled straight from your ass.</comment>

<comment>Your opinion is wrong.  No one cares what you claim to have on the internet.The fact that you don't realize that WHILE claiming to have these "credentials" is just more damning.Claiming to be an expert while being demonstrably wrong is just hilarious.You're funny.</comment>

<comment>Wow, so if I claim I'm a lawyer, I'm not a lawyer? So, does that mean claiming I'm not a lawyer mean that I am a lawyer?You claim to understand the 2nd Amendment and the word "inalienable." Under your logic, that means you understand neither (which you've thoroughly proven). I can stand by that.</comment>

<comment>No...if you claim to be anything, no one can prove it.You can claim to be anything...so why should we accept your appeal to authority.Your argument online is all that matters and you have not made a successful one.I've made no claims. I've put forth the argument behind the right to keep and bear arms.You have not refuted it.</comment>

<comment>No, he has shown, time and again, that he understands the meaning of the word.  Oddly, so have you, and yet you deny that there is anything like inalienable Rights!Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Nope.  The idiot would be you, because you are GREAT as telling people they are wrong, but can't back up a single assertion you make.  That makes you an "internet troll"!  Enjoy the new moniker.</comment>

<comment>So... what you're saying is you're too stupid to refute my point and thus you resort to ad hominem. Good job little buddy. Some day you might be able to hang with the adults, but until then, you should probably just keep your mouth shut and learn from those that are leagues more intelligent than you.</comment>

<comment>No, you are too stupid to MAKE a point!  Your assertions without a single bit of citation to a verifiable source make you the idiot.  Run along and play now.</comment>

<comment>I'm fairly certain that you're merely too stupid to understand the point. It's a common problem among the mentally challenged. Keep at it though. One day, you might be able to string together coherent sentences. Until then, you can keep relying on your speak and spell.</comment>

<comment>As yet, you have failed to present a single verifiable citation to your blather.  Are you incapable?  Of course you are.  It is easier for you to simply tell everyone they are wrong, then get some kind of thrill up your leg when people respond.  But your assertions, while totally WRONG, are at least amusing.  They are amusing because it shows the world you are simply another of those who thinks the government is your be all and end all.</comment>

<comment>So, start providing verifiable citations for your claims.  Oh, honest citations only, please.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>You seem to forget to end all your comments with, "because I said so."</comment>

<comment>(unrelated, but I wanted to share)Every time I see your avatar and SN I read in my head "Sergeant Thwack!"I realize that's not what it is, and I apologize if I got the rank wrong (I know nothing about the ranking hierarchy or the insignias showing rank), but I thought you might appreciate it.I know you usually *thwack* the hoplophobes around with your comments</comment>

<comment>If someone can deny you a gun, all that means is that they have more force available.By your logic, if one is enslaved, that means that they have no right to be free.</comment>

<comment>No, because we have the universally recognized human right to not be enslaved. Literally, it has been recognized as a human right. No such recognition has ever been bestowed on the ability to play with guns. Sorry, what you just engaged in is called a straw-man and it was a particularly bad attempt.But, that doesn't really surprise as I've never heard a gun nut make a cogent argument. Par for the course, really.</comment>

<comment>Not a straw man.You have the right to defend yourself and your freedom.You have the right to use the best tools to do so.No entity had the right to disarm you without cause.Your bigotry has blinded you to basic logic.The right to keep and bear arms is a human right.</comment>

<comment>By the way.... there is no "universal human right not to be enslaved" by your logic, since slavery still exists in much of Africa and the Muslim world.By your logic..... that means there is no right because someone took it away.</comment>

<comment>Really? 1926 UN Slavery Convention calling for the end of slavery.UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Just go ahead and read Art. 4.Suspiciously absent is the "human right" to play with guns. Hmm... I guess the UN and every 1st world nation on the planet didn't get the memo that playing with guns was an inalienable human right.</comment>

<comment>I'm just using YOUR logic.As for the UN...if you actually take that collection of thugs seriously on human rights......well...that shows the level of your intelligence.It is not our fault that the rest of the world is filled with statists that like to control their populations.</comment>

<comment>Wait.... so the UN, a body with members from nearly every country on the planet is "a collection of thugs" but the US government isn't. The US government, a unilateral body (as compared to the UN) is not "a collection of thugs" but the UN is.The mental gymnastics that reasoning required must have been exhausting.I'm just going to stop now. It's clear you're a person with a very serious, and severe mental illness. As shown time and again, you cannot use logic or reason with a crazy person. Seek help.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I consider much of the Congress a collection of thugs, too...but at least we try to live up to the promise of human rights.When the UN puts Saudi Arabia and other horrible nations on the Human Rights council, it is obvious that the UN attention to human rights is a joke.Thanks for surrendering.</comment>

<comment>Saudi Arabia, funny you mention them. You know they're like best friends with the US, right? You know 19 of the 9/11 hijackers were from Saudi Arabi, yet the US did nothing and instead invaded a wholly sovereign nation with nothing to do with 9/11. Yeah... I'd look to US conduct regarding other nations as an example of what not to do. The UN at least tries to do the right thing. The US just doesn't care whether it does the right thing or not.</comment>

<comment>Nothing you said contradicts what I wrote.My point was that the UN is a joke.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but you don't get to limit the conversation to "1st world" nations.  If the UN is serious about slavery, it has a duty to end it!  If it does not, then it is NOT serious.  So, which is it???Semper fi</comment>

<comment>The UN is a rule making body with little military force. Also, it does include 3rd world nations, just not on the security council. Moreover, it's pretty bad politics to just, ya know... take the US approach and invade a nation.</comment>

<comment>And yet, there is no universal outcry against Islam, which condones and keeps huge numbers of slaves.  Obviously, your "universally recognized human right", really isn't!Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Except, it is. I'm pretty sure no one but slavers condones slavery. Unfortunately, you can't just turn whatever country you want into a lake of glass. That's not how the world works.So, yes, it's universally recognized insofar as, those who aren't slavers recognize it. Murder is also universally recognized as wrong, but there are murders. Does that mean no one has the right to live because a small group of people don't recognize it? Think through things before you say them.</comment>

<comment>Just as people have the right to self defense, and defense of freedom, via arms.</comment>

<comment>No, the countries that accept slavery within their borders condone slavery.  Islam not only condones it, but demands it, and yet the UN which you celebrate does nothing.  So, while the UN may declare freedom to be a "universal human right", but they obviously don't really mean it.  On the other hand, our Founders meant what they wrote in the Constitution and Bill, and wrote extensively on the subject.</comment>

<comment>No one grants me any rights. The Bill of Rights protects existing inalienable rights. Go back to Civics 101.Those other nations do not recognize or protect the existing rights.Should the 2nd be repealed, then the citizenry would have to protect their rights, perhaps violently.The Constitution also protects the lives of those that are elected to represent us, giving them legitimacy.Perhaps you should read the Bill of Rights and the Constitution again.  You will not see any "granting" of rights.</comment>

<comment>So... what happens if the 2nd Amendment is repealed? What if it becomes, in the US, 100% illegal to own a gun. Where's your right then? What if, the mere ownership of a gun is grounds for imprisonment. Got a right then?</comment>

<comment>We still have the right.  If the government attempts to imprison people, the right will be infringed.It will be up to the citizenry to protect their rights against that tyranny. The Constitution protects the rights of the citizenry and provided legitimacy for the politicians. If the politicians and government fail to protect rights, or worse, seek to infringe on rights, those politicians become the targets.</comment>

<comment>The right would then fall under the 9th amendment as one of the "others.".Amendment IX"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."</comment>

<comment>That too. Thanks.</comment>

<comment>"The right there specified is that of "bearing arms for a lawful purpose." This is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed; but this, as has been seen, means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress."  U.S. v. Cruikshank, 92 U.S. 542 (1875).So, the right is not granted by the Constitution.The right exists regardless of the Constitution.The right as enumerated is a restriction on the power of the federal government.In the 2008 Supreme Court case, DC v. Heller, the court reiterated the exact phrase.I don't think you know what a right is, or how it is supposed to work.What one of the founders said concerning the Bill of Rights, of which the 2A is included."The whole of that Bill [of Rights] is a declaration of the right of the people at large or considered as individuals...[I]t establishes some rights of the individual as unalienable and which consequently, no majority has a right to deprive them of."         ---Albert Gallatin to Alexander Addison, Oct 7, 1789, MS. in N.Y. Hist. Soc.-A.G. Papers, 2.</comment>

<comment>Borrowed your case, Brother! It fit so well in another discussion. Thanks for doing the research for me! Lol!</comment>

<comment>Welcome to it, buddy.  I am open-source!</comment>

<comment>We've gone through this before. Your lack of legal understanding is astounding.You're wrong. The 2nd Amendment grants a right. It does not recognize a right. Case and point, if you go to another country, the 2nd Amendment is not a recognized right. Therefore, it cannot be an inalienable right.But, that's complex reasoning, something I suspect is so far out of the realm of possibility for you, that I would likely have better luck explaining it to an inanimate object.</comment>

<comment>Actually, your INTENTIONAL avoidance of showing me where I am wrong is what is astoninshing.  That is your OPINION, but there are myriad court cases where the rights of the 2A are shown to be just that, restrictions on the power of the federal government.  There are many other countries in this world that perform exactly as you want this government to act.  North Korea comes to mind.As for going to another country?  A spurious and false equivalence.  Most other governments of the world refuse to recognize the rights of their citizens.  The citizens still have those rights, but they haven't the power to force their governments to recognize or protect those rights.  That YOU think that is the same as the government GRANTING rights is just that--you think that is correct, yet cannot cite a single court case that would support your assertion.  And guess what?  RIGHTS which are NOT granted, but are inherent to the human condition is one of the founding principles of THIS nation!  Whether that is in your belief system or not.</comment>

<comment>FYI, the DC v Heller case, 2008, not a really OLD case."The very text of the Second Amendment implicitly recognizes the pre-existence of the right and declares only that it “shall not be infringed.” As we said in United States v. Cruikshank, 92 U. S. 542, 553 (1876) , “[t]his is not a right granted by the Constitution. Neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed … .”Perhaps you should tell the Supreme Court how little they understand of the legal system.</comment>

<comment>Oh, you mean the Supreme Court that took about 230 years to recognize something as an "inalienable right" in contravention to 230 years of prior history? Yeah... no serious legal scholar holds any of that in high regard. If you suddenly, radically, reinterpret something against over 200 years of precedent, and, moreover, take a position that at least 50% of the country is completely against, there's substantial evidence it is wrong.</comment>

<comment>In contravention of prior history?Please show me any case that claimed no individual right.We'll wait.</comment>

<comment>Don't need to. That's not how things work. You can't prove a negative. Until something is recognized as a right, it's not a right. For example, gay marriage. Until the Supreme Court said gay marriage was a fundamental constitutional right, it wasn't. End of story.</comment>

<comment>I'm not asking you to prove a negative.I'm asking you to prove your assertion that the Heller case was in contravention of prior history.  If there is prior history, there is evidence.The Federal gov't recognized an individual right in quite a few cases, but did not rule on it since that was not the subject of the case.  The problem was the idiotic incorporation doctrine that allowed states to ignore the Bill of Rights.  The individual right is recognized in many historical writings.</comment>

<comment>Really?  Not one???  Thomas, Scalia, neither are serious legal scholars?  Name one "serious legal scholar" who, with the previous cases in mind, does not hold the Bill of Rights in high regard.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>We'll they are the jokes of the Supreme Court and no constitutional scholar believes they deserve to be justices. Just read Richard Posner's taking down of Scalia. Posner is much more well regarded than Scalia.Here's the article.</comment>

<comment>Posner?  What a joke.  Posner is well regarded, but not by conservatives.  It is apparent you didn't read the article you cite.  Scalia would NEVER agree that his "vehicles in parks" remark is meant to keep ambulances out, yet Posner insists that it does.   Thanks for the good laugh, at your expense.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Umm... Posner is somewhat conservative. He has a range of opinions. You clearly don't understand the article. Posner was pointing out how flawed Scalia's logic is. If "textualism" requires adhering to the text, then the ambulance wouldn't be allowed in the park. Posner then (and this is how I know you didn't read or understand the entire thing) says Scalia later approves of the ambulance in the park. The point is, Scalia is a textualist only when it suits his purposes. He cannot even keep his ideologies logically consistent.</comment>

<comment>Posner considers himself conservative, as does the Left.  We do not.  His comment about textualism is incorrect, because Scalia did not say that.  Posner merely interpreted his remark in that way.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>I looked up the reference.  It is Posner making that comparison, not Scalia.  Does that make you lazy, in your research?  Or does it make you a liar, for attempting to attribute the comment to Posner?Further, in your previous comments you have asserted that Preambles have no legal standing.  And yet, in your reference, it is claimed that the first clauses of the 2d Amendment are a preamble, and DO have legal standing.  So which is it??Semper fi</comment>

<comment>230 years?  Where is the SINGLE court case that would make the 2A a granted right of militia ONLY?  IT DOES NOT EXIST ANYWHERE IN THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION!  But you are a master of repeating that lie!  Look up above, where I DEFINED what the Supreme Court said of the 2A.  IT ISN'T in the federal governments jurisdiction to declare the 2A is anything B UT an individual right.THERE IS NO PRECEDENT THAT HOLDS THE 2A AS ANYTHING BUT A RESTRICTION ON THE POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT!</comment>

<comment>Do they alll go to the same web site for that 200 years of precedent line?  </comment>

<comment>I'm not sure, but it still smells just like last weeks spoiled fish, doesn't it?  This guy is a regular fruitcake.</comment>

<comment>Seriously, this guy says he's a lawyer but repeats the same left wing talking points over and over.</comment>

<comment>He says he is a lawyer?  Well, maybe he is an ambulance chasing dillweed who has never stood in a courtroom!  I know I wouldn't let him defend me for jaywalking, as I think he could annoy the judge enough, that my jaywalking would become a capital offense!</comment>

<comment>Yeah... you know, except for the fact that in 230 years of United States history, NEVER was the 2nd Amendment held as an individual right, until Scalia and his cronies threw out 230 years of precedent to hold something completely opposite to the plain meaning of the statute. Textualist, indeed.</comment>

<comment>Please list all those decisions detailing those 200 years of precedent</comment>

<comment>Project Oyez. Enjoy.</comment>

<comment>So in other words you don't have anything but a link to law school?  Figures.</comment>

<comment>Not a law school. It's a compendium of every Supreme Court decision. Now, if you want to pay my billable rate, I'm happy to do case law research and write a memo for you. My rate starts at $250 per hour. Would that be cash, check, or credit card?</comment>

<comment>A www.  A lawyer.  Misguided enough to think that only a lawyer can interpret the Constitution.  Sorry, not worth twenty five cents an hour.  But feel free to continue to believe whatever you want, regardless of how misguided it is.</comment>

<comment>Um... yes, only a lawyer can interpret the constitution. That is literally the job of the federal courts, AND NO OTHER BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT. The Executive is charged with enforcement. The legislature is charged with producing statutes. The judiciary is charged with interpretation of the constitution.Jesus, did you even graduate high school?</comment>

<comment>Wow....such hubris.I'm sure that the Founders made sure that only lawyers can interpret...oh...wait....they didn't. In fact, you don't even have to be a lawyer to be a Supreme Court Justice.And no..the judiciary is not charged by the Constitution. That was seized by the court in Marbury vs Madison.Now I understand why liberals get so much wrong.</comment>

<comment>Find a single example of a federal court judge who was not a lawyer. I'll be waiting.Nope.Try again.</comment>

<comment>You seem to have missed the point. Probably did so willingly.As I stated, there is NO REQUIREMENT for a judge to be a lawyer, especially the Supreme Court.  They HAVE BEEN lawyers...but there is no need to be one.  Lawyers seem to be the ones that most think they should be in politics.You speak of discussions at the Convention. But it is NOT mentioned in the Constitution. You keep bringing up things that are not actually in the text of...well...anything. You get the amendments wrong. You just got this wrong.And there is STILL no evidence in the Constitution that it should only be interpreted by lawyers.So, your argument is, again, refuted.And we are still waiting for you to present your evidence.</comment>

<comment>Sure, here you go, the list of judges who were not lawyers.  There are 40 Supreme Court Justices on the list.  I hope you enjoy having your nose rubbed in your "legal training"! http://supreme.findlaw.com/sup...Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Lol. They really filled your head at law school with over inflated self worth crap.</comment>

<comment>Nope, just common sense. But, then again, people who are too dumb to know what they don't know tend to have a high opinion regarding their own (lack of) knowledge. You should probably read up on the Dunning-Kruger Effect. My bet is, you fall right into it.</comment>

<comment>Please....so show me this pile of evidence holding the right to keep and bear arms as a  collective right</comment>

<comment>You have yet to demonstrate any knowledge.  Please present your 232 years of precedent.You should probably put up some specifics, not some half ask smoke screen of a link to every court decision.  That stunt would get you laughed out of court wouldn't it?</comment>

<comment>So...in other words, you don't actually have anything to back up your assertion.Typical.</comment>

<comment>" Scalia and his cronies"Such respect for the United States Supreme Court.  Let us know when you make it that far.  I wonder if Scalia argues the law on anonymous internet message boards.  :)</comment>

<comment>Correct.  It was held as a restriction on the power of the federal government.  And you have one very glaring error!  The Bill of Rights HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED TO ENUMERATE THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL!  Too bad you are so silly as to forget THAT!The Supreme Court said the following, a mere 70 or so years AFTER the Constitution was ratified.Dred Scott v. Sandford, 60 U.S. 393, 417, 450-451 (1857)."It would give to persons of the negro race, ... the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, ... the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went."And THIS little tidbit."... no one, we presume, will contend that Congress can make any law in a Territory respecting the establishment of religion, or the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people of the Territory peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for the redress of grievances....Nor can Congress deny to the people the right to keep and bear arms, nor the right to trial by jury, nor compel any one to be a witness against himself in a criminal proceeding.... The powers over person and property of which we speak are not only not granted to Congress, but are in express terms denied, and they are forbidden to exercise them."Gee, that sounds like they are describing an individual right.  Yes, you are an ID10T.</comment>

<comment>So, what does the Cruikshank Decision mean, in which the Justices declare that they cannot decide on anything concerning the 2d Amendment, because the Right is untouchable??  If it is untouchable, it is a Right of all, as individuals!Semper fi</comment>

<comment>"Plain meaning"! You can't get any more "plain" than "The Right of the People...shall not be infringed".</comment>

<comment>Here you go: A direct quote of a Supreme Court Justice on the right of the citizen to keep and bear arms. For if they were so received, and entitled to the privileges and immunities of citizens, it would exempt them from the operation of the special laws and from the police [p417] regulations which they considered to be necessary for their own safety. It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognised as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right to enter every other State whenever they pleased, singly or in companies, without pass or passport, and without obstruction, to sojourn there as long as they pleased, to go where they pleased at every hour of the day or night without molestation, unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished; and it would give them the full liberty of speech in public and in private upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak; to hold public meetings upon political affairs, and to keep and carry arms wherever they went."and to keep and carry arms wherever they went."Citizens were described as those that could KEEP and CARRY arms wherever they went.Oh look....you are wrong AGAIN.</comment>

<comment>That one seems to be a "religious" type."There is one religion more dangerous than any other. It has been responsible for more murder and suffering than all others combined. Its followers blindly accept its rhetoric without question, while allowing themselves to be enslaved by its policies. This religion's worshipers are so inured that they have accepted its rules as laws and will obey them even to their own detriment.This religion is called STATISM."</comment>

<comment>Please list all those cases detailing 200 years of precedent.</comment>

<comment>Please list those scholars</comment>

<comment>Here's Judge Richard Posner's take on Scalia and his stupidity.You're welcome.</comment>

<comment>That's your scholar?  A guy who doesn't like Scalia?  LMAO</comment>

<comment>A United States Judge for the 7th Circuit Federal Court of Appeals? Yeah... that is. He's one of the most highly regarded jurists in the country. The fact that you don't know that speaks volumes as to your legal acumen.</comment>

<comment>A man with an opinion</comment>

<comment>A highly respected United States Appellate Judge. Not just some dude off the streets.</comment>

<comment>Still a man with an opinion.  Doesn't take a lawyer to understand the Constitution and original writings of the framers to understand the intent.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it very much does take a lawyer to understand the Constitution.For instance, every lawyer collectively rolled their eyes when many of the public stated that whatever TV network was "violating the 1st Amendment rights" of that duck dynasty guy when they fired him.How about 11th Amendment Sovereign Immunity? Here's a challenge, just reading the text of the amendment, tell me who is precluded from bringing suit against a state and who is not. Go ahead, give it a shot. Remember, just from the text of the amendment.</comment>

<comment>No.  They've filled your head with nonsense.  Tell me, in all your time at law school how much was spent on studying the Constitution and the original writings of the framers?  Most of your three years is spent studying other lawyers and other court decisions.</comment>

<comment>It most certainly CAN be an inalienable Right.  You've already quoted a part of the Declaration to me, but apparently did not read it for comprehension.  After "inalienable" comes a phrase that says "...that among these are...".  Please note the word "among", meaning that our Founders recognized that there are others which are inalienable.  Then, read the Preamble to the Bill of Rights.  To whom are the constraints directed?  To the citizen, or to the government?  What is a Right?  Merriam-Webster offers several definitions of Right, as a noun.  The definition I think fits best is, "the power or privilege to which one is justly entitled (voting rights)".  Note the "justly entitled".Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Oh, so if I include the word "among" in a sentence, that sentence now encompasses every single thing in the world, right? Even things that haven't even been thought of? Nice to know. I claim as my intellectual property the use of the phrase, "this is my phrase" among every other conceivable phrase in the English, or any other, language. So, I'm protected by copyright law, correct? I mean, I included "among" and under your rationale, that encompasses everything, including things never uttered by a human being, right?That's the stupidest reasoning I've ever read. No, the Bill of Rights, and every right for that matter, is an enumerated right. What that means is, if it's not written, it doesn't exist. That is the foundation of literally every legal system the world has ever known. Sorry reality doesn't mesh with your warped world view, but the rest of us are quite happy our rights are enumerated and not left up to some subjective guess as to which rights we do and don't have.</comment>

<comment>I certainly support your Right to go to court, and demand ownership of the phrase.  Of course, I'll laugh at you when a judge throws you out and charges you court fees!And no, the Bill of Rights includes the 9th and 10th Amendments, which retain ALL Rights and Powers not enumerated to the government, to the People and States.  Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Just as you think my claim is crazy, it was proof to show how crazy your claim was.Also, why bring up the 9th and 10th amendments? They have literally no bearing in this conversation. Also, they're the stupidest amendments on the planet and have virtually no legal significance anymore when the Commerce Clause is taken into account. But, keep beating that "states' rights" drum. I'm sure other nut jobs without any legal training will care. The rest of us... somehow we'll manage to muster on.</comment>

<comment>"They have literally no bearing in this conversation. Also, they're the stupidest amendments on the planet and have virtually no legal significance anymore"Well, that explains your abject ignorance.</comment>

<comment>Really? So, why is it that, despite sovereign immunity, you can still sue a state in federal court? To get around the stupid sovereign immunity amendment, you just sue the official, not the state.Why is that the federal government can, virtually, tell states what to do regarding education or family law? All they have to do is condition money on acceptance. That's not "forcing" but most states never turn down money. That's why ever state has a drinking age of 21.Try to keep up.</comment>

<comment>That is FORCING...because the feds have addicted the states to federal money.That said, the 9th amendment has no bearing on the above.</comment>

<comment>The 9th and 10th protect us from government overreach.  I asked you yesterday, but you didn't answer, so here it is again.  To what entity is the Preamble to the Bill of Rights directed?  What entity is constrained?  The Commerce Clause, which you should have learned in school, was intended ONLY to regulate international commerce, and to prevent the states from interfering with each other.  It does NOT grant the central government the authority to interfere as it does!  Your legal education may be good, though you offer no proof of it, but your general education is horrible.  You prove it with almost every post.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Yeah, here in reality, we use what happens in real life to determine outcomes.The Commerce Clause allows the federal government to legislate anything that affects interstate commerce. The federal government used the Commerce Clause to hold a farm liable for growing a personal supply of wheat in contravention to statute. That was "affecting interstate commerce" because of the aggregation theory. I could continue... like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or Title VII or Title IX, or anti-gun policy in school zones. Those are all Commerce Clause based statutes. All they need is a interstate jurisdictional basis to be a valid exercise under the Commerce Clause. So... you might want to read up on your history and Supreme Court decisions. The fact that you don't understand how the Commerce Clause operates kind of vitiates any credibility (not that you had any to begin with) regarding your understanding of the founding documents of this country.The Preamble is not a legally binding document. It has exactly no relevance in any judicial proceeding. It could be aimed at aliens from a star system a million light years a way. It'd be just as legally insignificant. The amendments on the other hand, those have significance. Preambles, never.</comment>

<comment>No, the government has taken power unto itself that was NOT intended.  Our Founders told us what they meant.  You claim to be a lawyer, but seem happy to accept unconstitutional actions. Your examples violate the spirit of the Constitution, because they are not enumerated Powers of the government.  It matters not whether the Supreme Court approved them.  It is in violation of its oath.The Preamble explains the Bill, and the Constitution.  If anything is legally binding, then the Constitution is, and you're celebrating the violation of that Constitution!Semper fi</comment>

<comment>If the actions were unconstitutional, why have they been constitutional for the past 200 years? Wouldn't that be an indication that the actions are constitutional?Just because you think something is unconstitutional, doesn't make it so.Again, you seem to have a very difficult time understand that PREAMBLES ARE NEVER BINDING LAW. At most, a judge (not someone like Scalia who's a textualist) can look to a preamble to assist in interpretation. However, if you go into court and use a preamble to support your argument, you will lose. You will lose every single time. Without question.</comment>

<comment>They have been so considered because the Court, in Marbury, seized power it was not accorded.  Semper fi</comment>

<comment>We are slowly bringing the States back around to the realization that they did NOT cede all their authorities to the central government.  We're winning, and you statists are slowly losing.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Wow...for a lawyer, you don't seem to remember much about the Bill of Rights."No, the Bill of Rights, and every right for that matter, is an enumerated right. What that means is, if it's not written, it doesn't exist."9th AmendmentThe enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.</comment>

<comment>States are free to have their own rights, that's all that means. Unfortunately, English appears to be a second language to you. If a state does not recognize a right, that doesn't mean you have that right. All the 9th amendment says is, if the feds don't have the power, the states do. That doesn't mean that if the feds don't have the power to recognize something, that something is recognized. No, what it means is, if the states choose to recognize a right, they may. They don't have to, and there's not a default position that rights unrecognized are legally enforceable rights.I don't even know how someone could honestly think that. So... let's play a little game to show how utterly stupid you are. Suppose I claim that I have the right to free higher education. No federal right exists for that. So, under your theory, since the feds don't have that right, it must be reserved for the state. So... if I go to my state and say, "Hey, the 9th amendment says that all rights not reserved for the feds belong to the states, and since I don't need an affirmative grant of rights to invoke my right, I have the right of free higher education. Where's my free higher education?" You think a state is going to say, "yeah, sure that's totally a valid exercise under the 9th Amendment. Here's your free higher education."No, what will happen is they will laugh at you and tell you to take high school government class. You do not have a right that has not been recognized. It's as simple as that.</comment>

<comment>"States are free to have their own rights, that's all that means."Wow.... you really are stupid. Point out the word "states" in this amendment."The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."Rights are not held by governments. Rights are held by people.Powers and authority is held by a government.Here you go:The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.Let's play your game.   You can make any claim that you want. Convince people that you are right.OF course, rights are not positive, but negative.  So, tell me how your "right to free education" would work.</comment>

<comment>Wow, I'd suggest you read the preamble to the Bill of Rights.  It will give you insight into just how wrong you are.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, as it turns out, even SCALIA ignored the preamble to the 2nd Amendment. But, then again, knowing that would require you to have actual legal knowledge.Preambles have NO LEGAL SIGNIFICANCE WHATSOEVER.</comment>

<comment>Do you try to be this wrong?</comment>

<comment>So, instead of actually reading the Heller decision, you decide to ignore it. Smart move. Clearly, you understand legal thought processes.Because you're too lazy and/or ignorant: Source.</comment>

<comment>the security of a free state, not the security of the state.  The preamble implies the right of the people (not the state) shall not be infringed so that they may retain the means to resist tyranny, regardless of whether it originates inside or outside the nation or Government.  Madison understood this in Federalist 46.  The preamble to the bill of rights further prescribes the bill of rights limits Government not the people.  I'll keep on going, because all you have is a book by one judge who hates Scalia and another judge who wants to rewrite the constitution </comment>

<comment>Yeah, too bad only 5 justices (and almost no other judges) in the history of the United States see it that way. Further, only those so adamant about their own political ideologies, decided the Heller decision against the weight of precedent and their own legal ideologies. But, I'd imagine such nuance is lost on you.If you have to abandon your own professed ideology to hold a certain way, it's because your political ideologies have trumped your legal reasoning.</comment>

<comment>what weight of precedent?  Or you just going to give another law school link.</comment>

<comment>The fact that in 232 years it was never held an individual right would be precedent. Therefore, holding that it was an individual right was against 232 years of judicial precedent.</comment>

<comment>Where,  you say that but have yet to provide a shred of evidence, instead you link to a list of  every court decision on every topic.  </comment>

<comment>1792 militia act detailed the minimum arms each man was to personally own.Madison, Federalist 46.U.S. Attorney Rawle: " In the Second [Amendment], it is declared.... that "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." The prohibition is general. No clause in the Constitution could, by any rule of construction, be conceived to give the Congress a power to disarm the people. "The right ... of bearing arms ... is declared to be inherent in the people. "FISHER AIMS, A Framer of the SecondAmendment in the First Congress</comment>

<comment>Really.  Then you should be able to show 232 years of people being denied the right to keep and bear arms and then why the 1934 NFA was unnecessary, or the 1968 GCA or the AWB, or the Brady Bill or why we even have background checks, and Conceal Carry permits.  There certainly have been a lot of laws put in, driven by liberals, around limiting personal ownership firearms for something that is not even a right.Why in 1857 was  the people's right to keep and bear arms specifically called out in the Dredd Scott decision as a right?Or in Cruikshank as an inherent or inalienable right guaranteed against Government interference by the Bill of Rights?  1876Why did St. George Tucker consider the right to keep and bear arms by the people the "palladium of freedom" and that, whenever limited, by any pretext put Liberty on the "brink of destruction" in his commentaries on Blackstone, the most influential and widely used legal text of the day?Why did Justice Joseph Story, in 1833, also consider the right to keep and bear arms by the people the cornerstone of freedom?Pressed v IL in 1886 ruled "we think it clear the sections under consideration which only forbid bodies of men to associate together as military organizations...do not infringe on the people's right to keep and bear arms."Then there was Logan v US which recognized it as a pre-existing right.No, the 232 years of precedent is that the right to keep and bear arms exist, and is an individual right, "the right of the people" - the same exact words used in the first and fourth.It's only since the liberal war on individual rights in the past 50 years in has become questioned.just saying "precedent" doesn't make it so,unless you are following the liberal playbook of repeating a lie enough until people think it's true.</comment>

<comment>Almost no other judges in history?Then I'm sure you have their statements close at hand.Let's see ONE historical judge make a statement while in office.There is no precedent for a collective right.</comment>

<comment>Posner is an idiot.For one thing..that is not the preamble to the 2nd amendment. The clause states the purpose as to why the gov't should protect the pre-existing right.  The 2nd does not create any rights.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, one of the most respected judges in the history of the United States is an idiot. Ok. It's too bad nobody shares that opinion. But, go ahead and continue to believe you know more about a subject that you have no knowledge of than people who've dedicated their entire lives. I'm sure next you'll start lecturing Stephen Hawking about black holes.</comment>

<comment>He has an opinion.  I think he is an idiot on some subjects.  If he is anything like you, he really IS an idiot.  You claim to have all these credentials...but so far, you have fallen short on most subjects.Posner is pro-gun control and thus he is biased. His argument makes no sense. He is an idiot when it comes to guns.</comment>

<comment>You know what.... I'm going to completely retract my opinion on Posner.I'm going to go research him instead of relying on YOUR flawed presentation.  I cannot depend upon the accuracy of any of your statements, since you keep getting everything wrong.</comment>

<comment>Where is your historical evidence from the founding era to support your assertion? If the framers of the constitution, who spoke and wrote in the English language, intended what you claim they did, then surely you would not have to rely upon Posner, since you could just point us to the relevant text from that era.</comment>

<comment>Don't hold your breath, Geralt.  The evidence he will find from the writings of the Founders will only support the importance of an armed citizenry as a safeguard against tyranny.  While he is busy looking up supporting evidence, maybe he can also find us some record of the Founder's trying to execute a confiscation of individual arms so they could be stored safely in an armory for the militia....more crickets.</comment>

<comment>There is no preamble in the 2d Amendment.  What we are given is one of the reasons why the Right to arms may not be infringed.  And because of the Right, the State is protected by all citizens from others, and from itself.You have still not answered my question about the Bill of Rights!  What is the subject of the Bill of Rights?Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Oh... so if there's no preamble, then you can't use the intellectually dishonest argument Scalia used to completely ignore the requirement that a well regulated militia is a prerequisite to a right to bear arms. Thanks for agreeing.See, Scalia predicated his entire belief that "well regulated militas" weren't necessary for the right to bear arms because it was merely a preamble. If you don't believe the 2nd Amendment has a preamble, then that means you believe the right to bear arms is predicated on the necessity of a well regulated militia which, at the time of the amendment, was understood as a formal, state run, militia.Thanks for playing.</comment>
