<comment>Hillary vs. any republican,  Vote for any republicanSanders vs. any republican,  Vote for SandersSimple!  Hillary is the pre-eminent establishment candidate. The same groupthink with same policies that gave us bank bailouts, 0% interest on savings, forcing everyone into the Wall Street casino and the financial carnage that's about to ensue...</comment>

<comment>Indeed. Unemployment is at a ten year low, the economy is growing, housing prices are stable. Compared to the global economy, Obama has done a magnificent job.</comment>

<comment>I don't know where you live but housing has spiked in many metro areas, under-employment is in the middle teens, inequality is at an all time high, and economic growth has been steadily positive but quite low by historical standards.Establishment Republicans and Democrats have failed the U.S.</comment>

<comment>Housing spiked in high value places because our economy is strong compared to the global economy; foreigners are buying up our assets. (Read: dumping their money in our economy. Woohoo!) Under-employment is high, but unemployment is fairly low and still declining. Economic growth is slow because we've taken on too much debt as the result of two GOP wars put on credit and a GOP plan in the 80s to force Social Security to store its surplus in bonds to hide some of the debt.Any talk of giving the GOP both houses of Congress and the Presidency as a way to spite "establishment Republicans" is lunacy. You'll never wrest the government away from the establishment by simply electing a different sort of President. Bernie might have more luck than Trump, but both would be forced to compromise with their own party as well as the GOP establishment.Why do we elect presidents who say they'll change everything and believe them? The establishment owns Congress which means it owns the purse strings and it owns the filibuster. No matter the good, earnest intentions of the candidate, they can  no more succeed at changing the GOP establishment than they can at changing the speed of light as long as the establishment still controls who gets elected to Congress and American voters still enjoy voting for idiots.</comment>

<comment>Well, you've certainly propped up a rather two dimensional straw man there.The GOP isn't the only problem, but it is currently "the" problem. We've been pulled so far to the right that a center-left, Wall Street candidate like Hillary is considered "too liberal." Even Bernie Sanders is a more rational candidate than the likes of Trump and Cruz, who are so bat-guano crazy that they should have never stood a serious chance. John Kasich is the only rational GOP candidate in a list as long as my arm, and despite his shocking numbers in New Hampshire, has absolutely no real chance at becoming the GOP nominee. When the GOP can put credible politicians on their ballot rather than demagogues, they can come back to the adults table. Until then, we're left with just one party that seems willing to govern responsibly. (And that, my friend, is a terrible thing in a two-party system. We need a rational GOP able to put forward people capable of governing a diverse country.)</comment>

<comment>And low inflation, low unemployment, a budget surplus under Bill, stock market growth, etc.Trying to lump Hillary into the mess created by Bush and the GOP and then recommend the GOP as the solution is bizarre.[I'm leaning Sanders, but my vote will go Democrat this year as the GOP is already in control of too much of the government.]</comment>

<comment>I don't idolize Clinton. He's the author of "Don't Ask Don't Tell" and DOMA, which affected me personally. So no, my age has little to do with this.What Bill had going for him (and George H W Bush and Obama and I suspect Hillary) is a divided government for most of his term which forced a lot of compromises. The excesses of either party are rarely good for the country.It's not easy teasing out what a president is really responsible for because economic trends sometimes take decades to resolve. How much of his "policies" were his or the best reaction to a difficult political compromise with a hostile opposition party? I offer DOMA and DADT as examples of exactly that. Generally speaking, presidents get the credit or blame for most of what happens within their term, even if it was the act of a prior president that started the ball rolling.Fun reading:http://cepr.net/documents/publ...</comment>

<comment>The 2008 financial crisis occurred in the Bush era but it was an unwind of the financial de-regulation that started during the Clinton administration.  Since 2008, the TBTF banks have only gotten bigger and taken on even more risky bets. It's only a matter of time before the next implosion.Coming back to the current race, unless we want to continue the charade of  Wall St. backed Republican  vs.  Wall St. backed Democrat,  I would never vote for any candidate who has Wall St. backing.  Why legitimize their corruption?</comment>

<comment>I start from the premise that not voting is worse than any other option. When there are legitimately good candidates on the ballot, even if they are pragmatic compromise candidates, I'm going to vote for the best one (or least worst, depending on your glass half full preference.)Of all the candidates on the ballot, Dem or GOP, only one has limited ties to Wall Street--Bernie. Trump is Wall Street itself running for president. Hillary is pragmatic, which means she'll be better than 100% of the GOP ticket.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget Bill's "tough on crime", blind eye to terrorists, and bank deregulation.  </comment>

<comment>You mean, this "blind eye?"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...Bank deregulation... yup, huge bipartisan support. He's also responsible for Dont Ask Dont Tell and the Defense of Marriage Act--both of which have earned him black marks in my book.</comment>

<comment>Idiotic. It's not possible to hold this position. It simply isn't.</comment>

<comment>Well, duh.  You do realise that the nuclear option is the worst option,  an apocalyptically bad option.  Especially when concerning a role which gives control of the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons.If it's Clinton versus Trump then why not just buy a gun and shoot yourself, why take the rest of the planet with you?</comment>

<comment>Change absolutely won't happen with a GOP lock on both houses of Congress and the Presidency. Trump would find himself with few natural allies in Congress and be forced to either capitulate with the GOP's policy goals or find himself fighting them at every turn. Neither of these are good outcomes for the country.The US does best, economically, when at least one of the three are held by a strong opposition party. It doesn't matter which one-- President, Senate, or House. However, it's pretty unlikely the Democrats will retake the House any time soon and the Senate could only really swing back to a slim majority. So, in the end, the only branch the Democrats really have a chance of owning is the presidency.We are better off with Hillary than any Republican in the presidency for as long as the House and Senate have such firm GOP control. And, realistically, Hillary will just be a rehash of Bill and Obama as they are all of the same political stripe. We've done quite well under their leadership overall.</comment>

<comment>Mind reading aside, which you fail at, btw, Trump and Cruz are both "nuclear options." All of the anti-establishment GOP candidates are frightening choices. Trump is a whacko but Cruz has successfully pushed to shut down the entire government in the belief that it's better to burn it down if that's the only way to "win." Just crazy.Given a choice between either Democratic candidate and the two GOP front runners, either Democrat is a better choice. I've voted for GOP and Democratic candidates in local and national elections my entire life. This year, I'm 100% sure I will vote for a Democrat as president. It wont matter which one it is because the other name on the ballot will be worse.My position is simple: I stand to lose a great deal if a GOP candidate gets elected. I stand to gain a lot or gain little depending on which Democratic candidate gets the nomination. So cost/benefit analysis says I'll vote Democratic for president. If that's Bernie, great. If that's Hillary, great.I see no need to "nuke" our government. That's bad for everyone.</comment>

<comment>Now it's on, and the verbal blows are for keeps between candidates.  Meanwhile in her high tech lair deep underground, Debbie Wasserman Schultz creates another trap for Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Wasserman Schultz reminds me a bit of Wile E Coyote in that regard.  She keeps building traps that blow up in her own face.  Honestly, replacing her should be job #1 for Democrats if they want to get competitive in state and local races again.</comment>

<comment>"The supporters at Sanders’s primary-night celebration were exultant at the outcome, one that seemed far-fetched mere months ago."Sanders has been leading polls in NH since last September. He hasn't been a "long shot" there since last July. But "astonishing blow" does make for a nicer headline.</comment>

<comment>You're correct.  The media has ignored Bernie for most of the time, so they aren't about to admit the truth: They've been dissing him and now they have no choice but to give him coverage.  Whether you support him or not (I do), is not the issue.  He IS running for President and he has HUGE support--esp. amongst the younger voters.  He deserves more coverage (not the 8 minutes for him vs. the 510 minutes for Trump over a three month period on one network, according to one January study).  What kind of democracy is that? The media doesn't cover Bernie because they don't like his message and the fact that he actually EDUCATES people on the issues.</comment>

<comment>So many articles about him have subtle (and not so subtle) demeaning language. "The Kids Are For Bernie" for example. Kids don't get to vote, those are young adults. And they're getting screwed by the status quo.</comment>

<comment>And of course the apparently official requirement to include his age at all turns. Constantly referring to him as being "the 74 year" old this or that. Hillary is 68. Trump is 69. Neither of them ever seem to have this number included among the unusual elements that they have overcome in becoming such strong candidates. If it were only used in relation to his popularity with 20 somethings and younger, fine. But its not. Its generally used along with "socialist" as a 'can you believe how popular this OLD MAN is??".</comment>

<comment>What they are failing to recognize is that even if he is older, his ideas are catching on with an entire generation. If he doesn't win the nomination, you can at least expect some young folks to follow in his footsteps.</comment>

<comment>New England liberal wins New England liberal primary. A shocker. I never saw that coming.Not even a little. Seriously.sorta.</comment>

<comment>It's not surprising Sanders won.  It's surprising that he won by 21 percentage points!  Five times the winning percentage of recent New Hampshire primary winners.</comment>

<comment>Congrats to Bernie and his supporters. But hoping Hil manages to pull this out in the weeks and months ahead.</comment>

<comment>Change is not as scary as unnecessary risk. For a marginal difference in ideology, we run a 74 year old socialist? Not very strategic.</comment>

<comment>FDR wouldn't have recognized Sanders as a kindred soul if Sanders came flying through the window in a red suit.</comment>

<comment>Wrong.  the policies he's pushing are current mirrors of FDR's priorities. Anti-trust,  jobs for Americans, reforming & prosecuting Wall ST.  Sanders' priorities follow TR, FDR, DDE on infrastructure & updating LBJ's Medicare/Medicaid to meet today's needs.   These goals fit with FDR's 2nd bill of rights et al.</comment>

<comment>More strategic to run the person who just got destroyed by a 74 year old socialist. </comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is NOT a "socialist". When did you turn into an anti-intellectual moron?</comment>

<comment>Thanks Dr. Schultz for bringing just a modicum of perspicacity to this discussion.  Can't there be an IQ minimum before folks are allowed to post comments?  That would save some of us a lot of time from reading idiotic, nonsensical statements.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but you're wrong on this count.  There is a HUGE difference in ideology between Sanders and Clinton.  There's no comparison.  That doesn't make one right or wrong, but that's the fact.  Bernie will get way more done to boost this country forward than Clinton will...that's for sure.  But if Bernie is a socialist, then so was F.D.R.  Their platform/s are almost identical.  And look at the great legacy of F.D.R. (aside from failings related to Pearl Harbor)...</comment>

<comment>Hillary will own the South and the West and a good chunk of the middle in the end. The unwritten news is that she walked away with 1/3 of the delegates from New Hampshire. It's a numbers game that's a bit more complex than winning the primary in 50 states; she's still the front-runner no matter what the news says. If she loses too many delegates in Florida and California, then it's time to panic.</comment>

<comment>Hey! Classy post!  More of this, please.  Voted up despite preference for Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Bern, Baby, Bern.  Les Mis victorious over Old Ms.</comment>

<comment>Enjoy your sweet but brief moment Sanders fans.</comment>

<comment>The US President has been reduced to a figure head.  With the gobs of money that every candidate is forced to beg from the elites, by the time the President is sworn in s/he is already beholden to the biggest donors.The advisors & experts that the President brings (or is forced to bring) to the table is what matters. That's where the billionaire class kicks in and plays the public for the fools we all are. You want another round of bank bailouts while Wall Street swallows up your hard earned savings, exports your jobs and pushes more and more middle class families into poverty? By all means vote for the candidate who borrows from Wall St.  (Yep, those millions in campaign contributions are NOT donations, they're loans. With the terms of the loan obviously dictated by the banksters!)IMO, Trump vs. Sanders is the only legitimate ideological battle as so far both have resisted any investments from the billionaire class and the Wall St. banksters. Anyone else is already compromised.</comment>

<comment>I would argue that Trump is compromised as well, between his ears.That said, and I really hate to admit this, I would rather he win than Mrs. Clinton. That was painful to type.</comment>

<comment>I want to thumb up your comment with your first sentence, but I cannot agree that Trump would be better than Clinton, then there's the matter of the Supreme Court. A republican win would fill the SCOTUS with  evangelical, conservative judges, and that would be disastrous for many years to come.</comment>

<comment>But Trump is neither evangelical nor conservative. That's why he didn't win in Iowa: the evangelical vote. And we conservatives KNOW the guy ain't conservative.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you in that Trump is no conservative... The question is, what in the hell is he? What kind of "judge" would he attempt to appoint to the highest court in the land?It would probably be a yooge disaster but I bet it would be entertaining to watch!</comment>

<comment>He is a populist. He could do anything, really. It's a big ole mystery. And it wouldn't be entertaining to watch to have people who have no clue of the Constitution in the Supreme Court. Vote Ted Cruz for actual conservatism!</comment>

<comment>Can I vote Ted Cruz for deportation to Canada, instead?</comment>

<comment>Haha I bet you criticized people complaining about Obama's eligibility. He's a natural born citizen because of his mother. He is clear to run and serve as President legally. Criticize his policies all you want, but not his eligibility, as that is FACTUALLY wrong.</comment>

<comment>You put a lot of words into my mouth just then. Impressive.</comment>

<comment>Why would you say what you said if not to complain about him not being eligible or whatever Trump is saying.</comment>

<comment>Because I'd like to see him deported? Why do you care so much about what I say?</comment>

<comment>Because we're supposed to be having a conversation. That kinda requires having an opinion on what the other says.</comment>

<comment>I don't think we'd have much to converse about, aside from our disdain for the new Teflon Don.Cruz's brand of uberhyperultra-Christian conservatism literally sickens me. No, I do not now, nor will I ever, want to see the face of the god he serves. Thanks anyhow.</comment>

<comment>"Cruz's brand of uberhyperultra-Christian conservatism"The "uberhyperultra-Christian conservative" that wants marriage to be left up to the states. Yeah. You might be confusing him with Rick Santorum (he didn't do very well, now did he?).</comment>

<comment>Should I have said his 'feigned' uberhyperultra-Christian conservatism, instead?</comment>

<comment>I have the feeling you never met a "uberhyperultra-Christian conservative". Cruz is a Christian conservative, yes, but he's not extreme at all.</comment>

<comment>You're absolutely right. He appears rather moderate if one were to compare him to the Westboro Baptists.“I want to tell everyone to get ready, strap on the full armor of God, get ready for the attacks that are coming.”</comment>

<comment>I don't know if Cruz said that, but it's possible. If you only looked at his speeches, he would come out as "ultra-conservative", but his policies ain't exactly fringe. He says that though he doesn't agree with gay marriage, it should be left up to the states. That's moderate. And I agree. I also don't support it, but I think that if the people in California or Massachussetts feel it would be the right choice for their societies, they should have the right to allow it. I have yet to see the same compromise from the other side of the aisle, but one can only hope.</comment>

<comment>Yes, let us come to a compromise on the issue of equal rights. Do you also believe that slavery and women's suffrage should be "state's rights" issues as well?</comment>

<comment>So you would compare traditional marriage to slavery? I don't even know why I'm surprised anymore...</comment>

<comment>You would deny equal rights to citizens based on fairy tales?</comment>

<comment>Based on protecting our nation's traditional institutions. And homosexuals already had equal rights.</comment>

<comment>"Based on protecting our nation's traditional institutions." So we've come back around to slavery and oppression of women again, I see. Or maybe you're referring to killing natives and burning witches? How far back exactly would you like to take the 'tradition' argument? And no, they did not. I'm sure you will continue to believe that, however, regardless of what evidence you are presented with.</comment>

<comment>Nobody could marry someone of the same sex. Everybody could marry someone of the opposite sex. Seems about equal to me.</comment>

<comment>And anyone who feels differently or is differently equipped DOES NOT DESERVE to be as equal as you are? Seems bigoted to me.</comment>

<comment>They were as equal as I was. They weren't forced to marry. Using equality to defend same-sex marriage is wrong. You can support it, and you have many valid reasons for doing so, but equality is not one.</comment>

<comment>I do not disagree with you at all. I am, however, fed to the gills with the Clintonian Lie Machine and the rest of the DC establishment, which it so accurately represents, that I would almost rather vote for the inevitable chaos that Trump would bring about. If America has truly become this stupid, then "The Donald" is exactly the kind of righteous punishment she deserves.I'll probably just stay home instead.</comment>

<comment>Then you're an imbecile.</comment>

<comment>Coming from you, I will take that as a compliment of the highest order. Thank you, Herr Doktor.</comment>

<comment>Yup!</comment>

<comment>Please keep implying that Trump is stupid. It only reflects badly on you. There are legitimate criticisms of the man but he is obviously brilliant.Also, keep wearing your edgy left-libertardian atheism on your sleeve, lol.</comment>

<comment>Two very important takeaways here: 1. Trump is a fuckwit. 2. So are you.Any further inquiries, CONfederate?</comment>

<comment>yeah try not to cut yourself on that edge bro</comment>

<comment>I'm not YOUR bro, son.</comment>

<comment>Sanders has most of his money from individual voters. Trump has most of his money from wealthy financiers, Wall Street, etc. Trump is famous at placing his name over other people's money just like your standard politician. He's just been doing it as a business rather than an elected representative.</comment>

<comment>Bernie says the government is rigged yet his solution is for bigger government. Hillary says things have to be changed yet she embraces Obama. I'm so confused.</comment>

<comment>i think sanders' primary argument is that the *economy* is rigged. economies get rigged when they are unregulated. the agent for regulation has to be the government. in other words a "free market" economy is a rigged economy because the theoretical free market doesn't exist.president obama has done a good job of starting to reverse the disastrous reagan policies that have carried the day for the past 3 decades, but more has to be done to reverse the damage. so what is needed is for the next president to build on the progress of president obama.</comment>

<comment>The economy is rigged because the wealthy are able to capture the government and rig it to their own benefit. No matter how socialist or populist the government starts out, this always happens. That is why SMALL GOVERNMENT is the best system to allow for freedom and the prosperity of the common man</comment>

<comment>When Multinationals have no loyalty to country of origin (and in fact when their net worth is more than that of many small countries), you need a government the right size as counter-weight, or those businesses will have a gov't that is plenty small enough for them to CONTROL. This has been known since the Gilded Age, when the dream of local, republican government gasped its last in America. All you are doing is peddling the propaganda of the Oligarchy.</comment>

<comment>The size of international FDI (foreign direct investment) is in the neighborhood of $20 trillion. That is larger than the size of the entire US economy. Corporate power is now the undisputed ruler of the world. Nations must now compete with each other for FDI. Who will be host to the factories? That's small fry - America is competing to host the headquarters, with the really good jobs. To that end, corporations don't want to set up shop in countries that are going to tax them to pay for the citizens healthcare and food stamps. Corporations hold all the cards. We need a small government with low taxes that attracts investment so that people can make money and take care of themselves. Corporations have options now, it's time to compete, not to gorge</comment>

<comment>Your solution to destroy all wealth.</comment>

<comment>The engine of wealth creation is the corporation - it is a sophisticated system of coordinating labor and capital to the end of creating wealth. What is the alternative? Take money from the productive class and give it to the unproductive class? Eventually you will run out of money, and all the wealthy people will hide their money in corporations who will HQ in Asian nations and all the super high paying white collar jobs will disappear as well. But the elite in the US no longer care about the workers - economies are global now and if the US is a big ghetto it doesn't matter. There are plenty of "middle class" consumers in the world now, no logical reason why everyone in the US needs to be part of this group anymore. The best solution is to have a govt that creates a friendly business environment to attract investment and jobs, and somehow manages to deliver the services people want from government in a more efficient way. My solution is to reduce the role of the govt in providing EVERY DAMN THING - and allow the market to take over in some areas (like healthcare and education, with massive deregulation), and let the systems that are better suited for efficiency deliver these services.</comment>

<comment>The corporations are the wealthy. You state that small government is the solution to preventing the wealthy from capturing government. Then you recommend that this small government be used to cater to the wealthy corporations? How does that prevent capture? It seems to me that your solution is to ensure capture by creating the perfect environment for them.</comment>

<comment>No - let me clarify. Wealthy and powerful interests (including corporations) will ALWAYS CAPTURE A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. That is why we must keep the size and scope of government power very small - and allow for the private sector (people in their homes with their own savings) to control the lion's share of the wealth. That is the only way to create a balance of power between the wealthy few and the less wealthy many.</comment>

<comment>I'm still not buying this. You haven't demonstrated that "the people," by which you mean individuals, can be successful at countering capture whereas those same people, working collectively through government, cannot be successful."Small government" is just code for a massive reduction in regulation. Who do we regulate? corporations. Government is designed as a balance against corporate interests because the general populous do not vote for corporate leadership or policies. That balance happens through regulation and taxation. Freeing the corporations from regulation and taxation is the opposite of "balance."Without government to break up monopolies, how do "people in their homes with their own savings" control  that corporation? Monopoly power leads to a massive shift of wealth from the individual to the corporation.The #1 mechanism for shifting wealth from the corporation to the general public is tax--a government power.</comment>

<comment>A government that is limited in scope will produce limited gains from capture. The democratic nature of our system necessitates coalition, and wealthy interests who control our government today could not so unrestrainedly pursue an agenda that is contradictory to the interests of the majority, if they were not able to make coalitions with various interest groups who enable them to do so. What facilitates this coalition building is patronage, concessions, special tax breaks, favorable regulations - all trappings of a sprawling government with its tentacles in every pie. ---A small government, that has it's role limited by the Constitution and the demand of voters, would not allow so much opportunity for wealthy interests to use it to bribe special interests. ---If the gains are minimal from capture, because the government is concerned with GOVERNANCE, rather than POLITICS, then wealthy interests will have fewer government goodies to promise special interests, in order to build their coalitions to pursue policies that may conflict with the interest of the many. And in that situation, we can get back to reaping the rewards that institutions like corporations provide: good jobs, profits from investment, and innovation (cheaper and better solutions to problems). In an ideal society, the #1 mechanism of shifting wealth from a corporation to the general public, would be employment, investment in equities, and cheaper and better consumer products.</comment>

<comment>In an ideal society, employers would pay workers a fair wage. We already know they won't do that without regulation because we have the American industrial revolution to teach us that. There are a raft of labor regulations that came directly out of our experience with unregulated industry at the turn of the last century. Ignore history at your own peril.I hear what you're saying and I'm still, still not buying it. You seem to think that government is some sort of irresistible honey pot of goodness that drives wealthy people mad with lust and that simply removing that sweet temptation would turn them back into good citizens who would ethically and faithfully execute their duties as honest captains of industry. That, unlike guns, the government is a weapon that should be blamed for its own misuse. What you ignore, again, is human nature and the historic examples of how companies were just as corrupt without government aid. With government out of the picture, they'd just turn their efforts to manipulating each other and the markets and still taking advantage of employees and customers. Collusion would be legal again so you'd see OPEC like control over territories and prices. A corporation wit the resources to capture government can also capture the "free market."In your "ideal world," we'd no longer have child labor laws, 5-day work weeks, minimum wages, and workers compensation? Welcome back to the late 1800s!</comment>

<comment>You act as if the only things that motivate human-capital allocation is taxes (just as the only thing that motivates the location of factories is labor). Again, this is corporate propaganda. If the United States is such an attractive place to base a company's high-end services (and in an increasingly unstable geopolitical climate, it is), then they should have to pay for the privilege. Further, you act as if we are price-takers in this. ALL governments have an interest in drawing more $ from the big concerns that are based within their borders. An economy as big and developed as the U.S. calls the tune. If we start taxing these businesses more, pretty soon everybody will - they will have no better options.</comment>

<comment>Our comparative advantage and ability to command higher prices (via taxes) is in steady decline from it's zenith in the immediate post WW2 era. Other nations and regions have caught up in the areas of educated workforce, political stability, and development of more mature industries and financial markets. While the Great Recession saw a brief, limited, temporary reversal of this decline, the overall trend is long term and unlikely to change. Corporations understand this, and they know that in the long run, they will be the ones dictating prices (tax policy) as they are the ones with the options (whether or not to relocate). I do not believe that raising taxes in the US will cause others to raise taxes - I fail to see how that makes sense. We already have some of the highest corporate taxes in the world, so we are already pretty much bilking corporations for the privilege of headquartering here to that absolute limit of what is possible. If anything, high taxes in the US will cause other nations to compete for our corporate tenants by lowering their taxes. The best option we can have is to bolster local industries and give them access to the same tax breaks that large corporations currently enjoy - and offset the decreasing tax revenue by decreasing bloated, inefficient government services.</comment>

<comment>I am a Bernie Sanders supporter, but many people will not understand what you mean by this. They need to read up on Jeffersonian Democracy and the reason to be skeptical of concentrated power. Jefferson also believed we had to have highly educated masses to stay vigilant and be a watch dog against the federal government and elite class. The most important program of the common welfare needs to be education.</comment>

<comment>Concentrated power is indeed an issue.  The thing is, smaller government doesn't stop the concentration of power.  It just removes that power from the public's control.</comment>

<comment>This is not necessarily true and I do not think you understand what I am trying to say here. The government needs to be as big as its mandate requires. Sometimes that requires increases. The issue is about a federalist government vs. a decentralized statist government. The concentration of power in the federal government is more likely to be corrupted and removed from citizen influence. Their purchasing and contracting power make them prime targets through which corporate and elitist agendas flow in the form of crony regulation and kick backs. The federal government should only handle interstate conflict and set the bar for minimum standards, then the enforcement and spending should happen at the lower levels (state, district, local). We should always be judicious in the level of power we hand over to authority and ensure there is recourse when it does not respond to us. If they do not derive their authority from us the people, then where does their authority come from?</comment>

<comment>I agree that education is extremely important to the functioning of a healthy democracy. I do not, however, believe the Federal Government has any business controlling our education. Federal control of public schools has coincided with skyrocketing costs, and a precipitous decline in quality.</comment>

<comment>Agreed... I take no issue with the tuiton free proposal though. Read my post below trying to explain federalist vs. statist government to Stranger in the Alps. I feel like certain minimum standards should he met and set by the federal government, but the execution and the freedom of teachers or local administrations to develop the curriculum to achieve those standards and above. That would provide a variety of approaches and the best results could be adopted. There are schools in my area which have gotten off of the county system and are thriving and I think mainly in part to the ownership by and the accountability to the parents whose children attend the schools.</comment>

<comment>This is actually not true. The rigging of the economy is done through crony regulations which benefit certain players (government picking the winners) rather than protecting people's rights, protecting the commons (i.e. environment), and protecting against fraud. This is also multiplied by the subsidies given to companies like GE, Monsanto, ExxonMobil, etc. along with the tax breaks and offshoring of profits. The trade deals are also rigging the system against us. Truly free market do not and have never existed on this scale, but it is an ideal to aspire to. Problem is that capitalism is self destructive once income, wealth, and power inequality reaches the heights we have today.</comment>

<comment>It's no wonder you're so confused. You have no idea what you're talking about.</comment>

<comment>The OP has a point.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, it's a poorly reasoned and incoherent one.</comment>

<comment>What do you disagree with?</comment>

<comment>His solution is NOT for bigger government, but for a more equitable gov't. There's a difference.</comment>

<comment>It's not bringing back big government; It's bringing back government which works for the people and not wealthy campaign donors. Representation is key in a constitutional representative republic.</comment>

<comment>I don't know why anyone is acting like this is a major cosmic shift. Every poll had Bernie up by large margins in his backyard, where all the demographics play to his strengths. Major upset right there. It isn't like Hillary was surprised by the result either, she had her campaign person prepped with a concession pretty much as polls closed.The real question is what happens in South Carolina, and if Sanders can leverage the tie in Iowa, and his win tonight down the road in battles where the ground definitely doesn't favor him. I dislike hillary as much as the next guy, and not as much as the republicans, but the hard truth of the matter is the next time Sanders might have structural advantages will probably Wisconsin or Ohio.</comment>

<comment>It isn't a major shift in itself, but it should be noted that the polls had Sanders up by 10-12 points, whereas his actual margin of victory was 21.  He beat the polling in Iowa as well.  Combine that with a narrowing of the margin in national polls, and there is a shift going on.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if all these people voting for Sanders know he's against reparations and therefore supports the totality of the white supremacist industrial complex.   All kidding aside, it's good to see Jealous come out for him, and I suspect other black leaders will catch on and do the same (aside from the grand poet).  I would also imagine as Latinos come to know Bernie better there will be movement there, too, particularly in the under 30 segment.  We'll see what happens.  This has been the most entertaining cycle with the possibility of the most dire of consequences.   May you live in interesting times.</comment>

<comment>A tie in Iowa followed by a resounding win in New Hampshire. That's only the beginning. The electorate is increasingly understanding it's not so much about Senator Sanders himself as it is his message. It doesn't matter if this message is promulgated by a 74-year-old or a 20-year-old; it doesn't matter what that messenger's ethnic background, race or religion is; it doesn't matter if the message comes from a man or a woman; nor is the "socialist" label even relevant anymore. Ask ten people what "socialism" is, and you will get ten different answers. What DOES matter is the message itself and the realization that it is happening, just as it was with Teddy Roosevelt, FDR and Martin Luther King, Jr., and this time it's for keeps and absolutely nothing can stop it. Its first twenty-first century resurgence began with the Occupy Movement and continues with the Sanders campaign. Mega corporations and big banks know that the consciousness has risen to the point that they are powerless to counter it (it is YUGE with independents and is even crossing party lines)! No matter what they are devising, it will not succeed.What WILL succeed is the end of income inequality, and the realization of Thomas Jefferson's vision of real democracy.That vision WILL happen. God willing it will happen with the President Sanders administration. If not, take heart: We are a force for REAL progress, equality and yes, peace, and NO plans to keep Wall Street in control can stop the power of progressive change.Feel The Bern, yes...but especially, feel the message!</comment>

<comment>the vote machines are rigged - sanders is no serious threat to the corporate establishment. If worse comes to worse and the country goes socialist, the global corporate cabal will pull out of this country and shift their operations to Asian nations with more friendly/authoritarian governments - and America will turn into South America</comment>

<comment>Yes, and the aliens will break out of their holding facility at area 51 and fly the elite to Saturn, behind which their death star awaits...</comment>

<comment>America is turning to South America as you type.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and this will continue, and even Trump is not going to stop it.</comment>

<comment>This is funny.  It's the rise of the stupid people.  Idiocracy is truly a documentary.</comment>

<comment>Better alert blacks and Hispanics. They're still for Hillary. </comment>

<comment>Well said!</comment>

<comment>Watch the productive members of society decide it is no longer worth it to pull the long hours and take the hard jobs just to see the fruits of their labors get involuntarily ''re-distributed' by the ever growing Federal monster. Better not to waste one's time.</comment>

<comment>Mega corporations and big banks have no fear of you or Sen Sanders, and peace is not breaking out anytime in the near future.</comment>

<comment>Extremist and anti-establishment politicians are having a resurgence throughout the world. Consider,- France, Marine Le Pen- UK, UKIP Nigel Farage - Trump and Sanders fall into this fringe category.</comment>

<comment>It is a reaction against forced liberal policies of cultural dilution. People don't like having their communities swelled with unassimilated foreigners and then being called racist when they complain about rising crime and plummeting property values.</comment>

<comment>How does that account for Bernie?</comment>

<comment>It doesn't. The Democratic Party in the United States is the one party in the world that in fact is doing its best to embrace ethnic and cultural pluralism, and forge a new liberal order on the basis of it. The fact that a 74 year-old white contender for that Party's nomination gets it, that Black Lives Matter, is just one proof of this. We will not go the way of Europe into tribalism and ethnic balkanization. The real obstacle to this is demographic. The Republican Party will either adapt to the future America that is coming, or it will die out.</comment>

<comment>You are for open boarders, and ignore the issues of mass immigration.</comment>

<comment>Your correct if you change the word "embrace" to "create"</comment>

<comment>"The Democratic Party in the United States is the one party in the world that in fact is doing its best to embrace the example of Brazil"fixed that for you.The Republican party *will* die out, as the majority of non-whites vote Democratic. Unfortunately, this is not a sign of enlightenment, they're just voting for more govt. handouts.</comment>

<comment>Question: when you write "the Republican Party will either adapt to my view of the future or die out," you understand you're issuing a threat, right? You realize that people who hold different opinions from you aren't likely to take you seriously when you talk like that, particularly since your threat isn't particularly credible?</comment>

<comment>It's not a threat, because it's not a consequence I can make any personal contribution to. Insead, what I said is simply a description of the situation. Reaganite conservatism has wedded Republicans to policies that are by any objective measure bad for the country; but far from learning from this, Republicans are doubling down on ideology. And actually, it's even worse than that - in the person of (of ALL people, Chrissakes) Donald Trump(!) it has led to the identity politics of a crypto white-nationalism. This is a worldview that has no future in the Unites States.</comment>

<comment>I would associate Trump w Le Pen and UKIP. Bernie's popularity is the result of Hillary's unpopularity. The socialist platitudes play well with college kids who haven't lived in the real world yet.</comment>

<comment>i would say that anyone who has lived in the real world outside of the usa ....knows that sanders policies are in practice in many countries i have lived in and they work extremely well the people are educated and healthy...that is what the out come of the marshall plan was after ww2  ...those countries became what bernie is saying ...it is socialist capitalism  ...it works well enough to keep them in the top 10 prosperous countries compared to our 62 place in the list of prosperous countriesand they are also the happiest people...so maybe some real world reality should be counted into the mix</comment>

<comment>Whats Alanis ironic about that is that youth unemployment in all the European social democracies is double the US and compared to actual Socialist countries, its sky rocketing..</comment>

<comment>yep all over the world we are in what is the begining of world wide anarchyit is the unintended consequences of the 2008 financial implosion and  the ramifications of that are felt from greece to russia to australia vhina  no country is untouched...the second shoe is about to drop.....from that debacle and the bailouts that followedsocial democracies youth unemployment is skewed  by the fact that almost all of the young adults are in college....which is free and if i remember correctly you are given a stipend to live so you can get the best education you can without struggling to pay bills...and no debt ridden diplomas...on the other hand everyone of these countries have students who take education very seriously ...unlike americans who see it as a necessary evil to get a job...we need a national re do....take sports out of schools...sports have nothing to do with education...sports needs its own catagory under entertainment....not education....start with that as step one</comment>

<comment>Actually the most prosperous countries in Europe for the last two decades have been the Nordic countries, and their people consistently rank as some of the most depressed people in the world. And the reason the Nordic countries are doing slightly better than the "southern" countries, is because they have been drilling oil - the last of their oil. Additionally, GDP growth in Europe was higher BEFORE socialist policies were enacted - and SINCE then their average annual GDP growth has been around 1 or 2%. Very low. Dangerously low, actually. Europe has already experienced at least one lost decade, maybe now we are into the second lost decade. ---The thing about socialist policies is that they spread wealth to the people - and obviously that is an attractive prospect for people who feel they have no other avenue towards financial stability. HOWEVER - the economic results are extremely clear: socialist policies lead to lower overall growth, and lower overall growth leaves economies dangerously vulnerable to stagnation, malaise, and then desperation (as in, they are desperately immigrating millions of un-assimilated Muslims to try to improve their bottom line - at the expense of social cohesion, peace, and security. Or, they are desperately drilling the last of their oil. Or, they are desperately (in the case of France) invading their former colonies and becoming militarily aggressive). ---Why does socialism produce lower overall growth? Because growth comes from investing in profitable enterprises. Having happy people is great - but if you just invest in your own happiness all the time you will not create future returns on that investment - you'll be happy and then you'll go broke. That is why there needs to be a balance between investment in social welfare, and investment in a business friendly climate where the true engines of wealth creation (corporations) are able to do what they do best and create jobs and wealth. Ideally it would be up to each individual citizen (or household) to manage their own private financial affairs, and create their own happiness, whilst the government merely enforces contracts and maintains law and order.</comment>

<comment>Bernie voters are smart enough to understand that Wall Street is screwing them - but not quite sophisticated enough to understand how mass/illegal immigration is contributing to that.</comment>

<comment>Another hopeless election year for real change. Trump says the Right's poison has lost its potency, so he proposes a stronger poison or a stronger dose. Sanders proposes real change, but if he won he would be all alone and powerless to make any change, so his presidency would be futile at best. So the impasse continues for a while.</comment>

<comment>Sanders proposes real disaster.</comment>

<comment>We have been in a real disaster since Vietnam and since the US decided to give the American industry to China.</comment>

<comment>Where is the Hillarious supporting story by Mark Ambinder?</comment>

<comment>Most Americans won't know this but Bernie has a British brother, Larry Sanders.  You probably know Larry from his time playing for the Milwaukee Bucks,(2010–2015), but after he moved to the UK he became a small, white Jewish academic to meet our very rigorous immigration rules.</comment>

<comment>As much as I despise his policies, I gotta hand it to him: at least Sanders is honest. And in politics, that's a huge breath of fresh air. Now...y'all know it will be VERY hard for him to win, right? The DNC and the Clinton machine will do EVERYTHING (yes...EVERYTHING) in their power to ensure Hillary gets the nomination. And even if he gets it...then Bloomberg would probably run, taking quite a few votes from the democrats, and ensuring a Republican win in november. The best leftists can hope for (and Sanders probably has this in mind) is for him to push public opinion to the left and have another candidate in 2020 or 2024 with a similar message that actually has a decent chance to win.</comment>

<comment>Shocking that Hillary's strategy to dispatch Albright and her husband to insult voters didn't work. </comment>

<comment>We've had 2 primaries, almost devoid of the African American vote, and Bernie is down by 8 delegates. I really dont understand how the media spins that into a success narrative for the Bernigans....</comment>

<comment>This Election has only three primary and three  secondary matters of urgency to common man-ordinary citizens , society needswhat we need is Hybrid  Solution , which is  70% Bernie  + 30% Trump but that's not going to happen  primary issues are as follows in priorities1. Health and rising costs -- Insurance, treatments ,local pollution,... , some kind of public health system needs to be implemented or regulation  enforced against greedy industry minds ,may be like canada or other European countries,...we can have public/ govt hospitals.2. Economy and Job losses or creations & its cascaded social DOMINO effects such as losing homes , not able to afford healthcare and educational costs,...--all of which is result of everything being outsourced mindlessly or imported mindlessly by giving reasons and excuses of productivity ,cost optimization and being  competitive--a level playing field could be created by having non linear tax structures for local vs offshore industry or offshoring by local industry or imports, also  outright policy of having quota .. such and more extreme measures are needed to protect the masses.3. personal security and safety -- GUN LAWS and its improvement , mass influx of illegals and crime Secondary issues are as follows in priorities4.  Global economy and its local effects5. Global warming and pollution and its  effects6. Global terrorism and its local effect</comment>

<comment>If you are paying attention you will see that Trump got 25% of the GOP vote in Iowa, and 35% of the GOP vote in NH. At most, he gets the support of 1/3 of the GOP voters. Where are those people who dislike Trump going to go?The bluster around Trump obscures the fact that he's not getting a majorty of his own party--not even close</comment>

<comment>Bernie can't even stand up for himself. No way I'm supporting him.</comment>

<comment>Super delegates are  JOKERS ! , they either go for rich or powerful and are available for a buyer , they have no honesty or  courage to do the RIGHT THING or to GO against the Establishment  and  vote for what is good</comment>

<comment>Great, vote against the establishment. Vote for Green Party candidates or write-ins or Libertarians for congress too while your at it and see them all fail and end up with an even greater Republican lock on congress. Good plan.</comment>

<comment>Thank you</comment>

<comment>If they just knock out the Corrupt Clintons and nominate Bernie, they don't have to vote Green Party.Sorry, Bloomberg cannot save you if Hillary goes down.</comment>

<comment>I will vote for Sanders if it comes to that because I am a long time liberal and would never vote for a conservative out of spite. I believe in a greater cause than Bernie or the latest revolutionary sound bite.</comment>

<comment>The sad thing is that you seem to not understand the HUGE difference between Hillary and Bernie.</comment>

<comment>They voted 93% in synch in the Senate.</comment>

<comment>If the Democrats want to win they have to nominate candidates people want to vote for, nit just candidates who appease wealthy donors. Sander leads especially strongly with young people, both women and men. Extremely foolish to dismiss that fact. (I'm 56)</comment>

<comment>jew christian muslim ...is irrlevant sanders was always evolved the electorate has caught up to him....just in the nick of time</comment>

<comment>I don't think it's necessarily a racist premise. It's not clear to me that an elderly jewish man wth a heavy accent can win in the South. Lots of African American voters are motivated by strong christian belief.  No jewish american has ever won a primary before. There's no reason to assume black voters will reject him, but there's room for doubt about the extent of his appeal.  I'm voting for Sanders but it's a tough slog from here on out.</comment>

<comment>Well, he appealed to 49% of them in NH.</comment>

<comment>I am a Democrat and when I vote I am voting for the Democratic party and not for an individual. Of course the individual has to fall into the general parameters of what the I believe is the Democratic party stands for. My problem with Sanders is that he and his supporters don't really support the Democratic party so I can't feel confident that when they go to the polls that they are going to vote for Democrats down the line. In fact Sanders campaign is pretty much based on a rebellion against the entire Democratic party. Are the people who are being whipped into a frenzy by Sanders going to vote for the establishment Democratic Senator or Representative? They are exactly the people that Sanders is running against! Whether he eventually wins or loses the presidency I am afraid that he will be a disaster for Democrats and liberalism.</comment>

<comment>Trump voters are giving DC the middle finger. Bernie voters are giving Wall St and the .01% the middle finger they deserve.</comment>

<comment>The difference is that Sanders actually understands how gubmint works. Trump just has this ipse dixit word-salad that basically boils down to "people will do what I tell them too because I'm just so cool".The amazing thing is that so many people seem to worship a guy whose primary skill is pretending to fire people who don't really work for him on a reality teevee show. Mencken was an optimist.</comment>

<comment>this is about our country not about a party affiliation.....this is team americayes it is a rebellion against the bought and paid for congress it will not be supported and they will be run out of officeit is a revolution that you should want to be apart of not view it as the enemybernie sanders is the democratic party's only hope for a future ...they need to let go of the past and their donor class dependence and come to the realization that it is we the people who they are responsible to ....when that happens then the democratic party will regain its lost luster and its moral compass will be recalculated to meed the needs of the people not the greed of the we own you contritutors/lobbyiest....its over ...done ...we are in full on revolt and if you like many of us who watched as the democrats became unrecognizable from the republicans...we demand better and you should toobernie sanders is the best opportunity the democrats have ever hadits not about words said  it is about the deeds donewe are cleaning house....469 seats congressioal seats are up in 2016we are takning the like minded with us and replacing all the rest by 2020 with representatives who will do the will of the people and not the lobbyiestsbernie can transform the democratic party into the glory days when we were proud to be a democratthis is what revolution looks like in 2016 ....it has just begun and you should not fear it but join it if for no other reason than to save the democratic partybernie has delivered to the democratic party the youth and  through him the future of the democratic party...that is what his voters are the future...why alienate them ...that is democrtaic party suicide</comment>

<comment>Okay and while this revolution is taking place liberals lose more seats in congress, probably the presidency (maybe not) and the Supreme Court goes further right. This is not a game for amateurs. If you don't get it just stay home.</comment>

<comment>Oh, the faster, the better. We have to hit rock bottom, and the worse things get, the greater the chances of a real revolution, the kind that drags guillotines to the public square and starts giving free haircuts to the nobility.</comment>

<comment>It seems that you are the one who doesn't get it.  Democrats win when they excite young voters and have high turnout.  The GOP wins when Democrats play it safe.  Bernie can spike turnout, which will do a LOT more to flip the Senate (the House is in GOP control until 2022 at the earliest thanks to 2010 redistricting) than anything Clinton can do to make up for the fact that she doesn't excite anyone, especially the young and inconsistent voters that the party needs to win.</comment>

<comment>"Given the choice between a Republican and someone who acts like a Republican, people will vote for the real Republican all the time." -- Harry S. TrumanThe rear-guard hippie-punching appears to be arriving right on schedule. You people run a tight ship, have to give you that. When Hillary wins the nomination but loses the general because her negatives are almost as high as Trump's, just remember it'll be not because the hippies insisted on Bernie, but because registered Democrats defected to whichever mutant gets the GOP nod. Count on it.</comment>

<comment>Do you even know how to read or seek out real information? When Hillary was in the Senate she was ranked as the 11th most liberal senator. She is endorsed by all of the top 10 most liberal senators. So how exactly is she someone who acts like a Republican? Most of the people responding to myc comments are delusional about Hillary and Bernie. Grow up and do some real thinking about politics and what it is all about an who the real liberals are.</comment>

<comment>You're not hearing me. Yes, compared to Senate psychopaths like Cruz or McConnell, or any of the GOP presidential candidates, HRC is most certainly a liberal and a Democrat. But she will have to tack right in the general, in order to try to win over people who are going to vote for Trump anyway. But people like yourself will continue blaming some imaginary sliver of "leftists", because you don't know what else to do.Here's the thing:  I read way too many magazines and blogs and comments, and an unfortunate trend is already rearing its ugly head. Every single Bernie supporter I've encountered has made a point of saying that if HRC gets the nod, they will vote for HRC, because the prospect of a President Cruz or Trump is just too abysmal. But anecdotally at least half of the HRC supporters I've seen have threatened to hold out if Sanders gets the nom.Which makes them no better than the 2000 Naderistas they can't get over.</comment>

<comment>Politics is a team sport and the party establishment is the team. Sanders has played outside of the Democratic team for years but we assumed he was still basically on our side. If we knew he was going to pull this trick we would have booted him out. Thanks Bernie.</comment>

<comment>I hope you are making money from Democrat establishment corruption - otherwise you are just not too bright.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you aren't too bright. I have a lot of sympathy for Sanders message and I am proudly an establishment Democrat. I have supported a lot of very liberal Democrats but they have been Democrats and have supported me and their colleagues. Sanders has never done that because they know that getting things done takes a strong team. Sanders is a disaster for the Democratic, liberal team.</comment>

<comment>So getting more votes than someone else is a trick. Interesting choice of words.</comment>

<comment>The trick I am referring to is his decision to basically run against the Democratic party while posing as a colleague and supporter all these years. He in fact is the biggest fraud in the race.</comment>

<comment>The fact is he's had the most consistent message since he began his career. Everyone else has played four sides of every issue.</comment>

<comment>Just four sides? You're being kind omitting the other 356 sides.</comment>

<comment>If you look at Senator Sanders' whole political life, I don't think you can come to that conclusion.  He is principled and consistent and his political career began well over 50 years ago.He is a progressive no matter what you may think of his party label.</comment>

<comment>???Sanders was always an independent. he founded the Congressional progressive caucus.He has been very consistent as a successful, pragmatic, left wing politician.  He is winning a majority of Democratic voters.If I wanted to make an argument like yours, I would point to the coronation of clinton, a candidate who generates little or no enthusiasm, and who only seems to get the votes of people, like yourself, who think Sanders is unelectable.$6670,000 she took for three speeches to Goldman Sachs. How is that not betraying the Democratic Party?</comment>

<comment>Maybe democratic leaders should not be running against the interest of their voters.That seems to be your bigger problem here.</comment>

<comment>BULL SHIT.Bernie isn't on the team, but he's been putting his political capital behind them his entire congressional career.</comment>

<comment>As long as Clinton sticks with her public-shaming-of-voters-who-support-Bernie strategy, especially by people in their eighties, I'm sure she'll have no problems going forward.</comment>

<comment>The race gets harder for Sanders after this. he had a natural constituency in NH but I have a hard time seeing a jewish man winning in the south. I'm voting for Sanders, and have been supporting him since he entered the race, but I'm not optimisitc</comment>

<comment>what millinium are you living in....not this one blacks won't vote for jews....that is racist insanitythis is a revolution not evolution...it is colorless and genderless it is the future ...so you may well want to reconfigure your assumptions</comment>

<comment>I'll be happy to reconfigure my assumptions if Sanders wins in the South. But you saying something does not make it true, or make it an argument. Sanders does not poll as well as Clinton among black Americans. It remains to be seen if that polling data is accurate. I'm voting for Sanders--why are you insulting me? </comment>

<comment>Stylistically, his opinion is made forceful by his tautologies.  They are still just his opinion.</comment>

<comment>people CANT BE FOOLED by corrupt politicians or their deceitful propaganda or greedy agendas  , people decide in DEMOCRACY and they have REALIZED that Bernie is good for US and USA, we need Bernie , USA needs Bernie</comment>

<comment>I don't blame Bernie for going long in his victory speech. The media has been ignoring him for months and he finally got the attention he needed. Good on him for taking advantage of that free airtime to get his message out.As for Hillary's "firewall", there's an excellent article at The Nation that questions whether blacks should vote for Hillary. It doesn't endorse Bernie, but it lays out a very good case for why Hillary doesn't deserve the support of black voters.http://www.thenation.com/artic...</comment>

<comment>How did Bernie win NH?  He's a known quantity from next door: Vermont!  If he lost NH then might as well fold shop and head home.</comment>

<comment>New York also neighbors NH, so I guess Clinton should fold shop.</comment>

<comment>Respectfully I would disagree.  NY is a far larger and more diverse state than NH, VT, Maine combined.  The combined population for the three is 6M and predominantly small-town/rural.  NY has nearly 20M residents of which nearly 8.5m live in the NYC boroughs (just under half the entire state and larger than the three states above!)  and far more diversity.</comment>

<comment>I think demographics are(is?) destiny, but as Bernie says, WE NEED A BIG TURNOUT.</comment>

<comment>Respectfully, I would disagree.  New Hampshire borders three states, and New York is not one of them.That said, Clinton is every bit as known to New Hamsphirites, so it should be telling that she lost essentially every single demographic to Sanders.</comment>

<comment> a known commodity ..that is why he won new hampshire.if we go with that assumption ...it means that bernie is well respected after 20 years in office....that says something importantit says when the rest of the country know him he will win there also for one reason he is authentic has integrity is trustworthy and is not boughtso he sould fare very well in the rest of the country because we are all fed up with the status quos failures...its over ...its done ...we are in revolution the american revolution of 2016</comment>

<comment>But how did Hillary lose? I mean, what happened to the unanimous coronation of Queen Hillary?</comment>

<comment>Yup.  I'm pretty sure she's a known commodity, too.  Or maybe that's the problem - voters aren't sure which Hillary they're going to get.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is from neighboring Vermont and was projected to win big. His victory there is hardly surprising anymore than his success in Southern states is still in doubt.Regardless, Bernie Sanders is a terrible nominee and liberal enthusiasm for him is based entirely on self delusion and absurd wishful thinking. A 74 year old socialist with an incredibly thin record of achievements who only became a 'Democrat' last year and who's views are completely at odd with mainstream America is poised to lose by a landslide if he's the nominee. God knows I will NOT vote for him. I want no part of an economy-wrecking socialist ruining our party's reputation for a generation - all so leftists who vote once a lifetime can claim to be our "base." I'm sick of the conspiratorial, anti-capitalist bull$#!T being puked out of his mouth and by his ignorant supporters. If Hillary Clinton fails to get the nomination, I'm sitting out the 2016 election.</comment>

<comment>we will be getting rid of that southern doubt  ...right quickand as for you sitting out the 2016 election...i think that is a wise choice on your part</comment>

<comment>In 2004, you could have substituted Obama for Sanders in your rant.</comment>

<comment>What reputation? As economy killers or gimmeedat dispensers?</comment>

<comment>Wow--you calling me ignorant and deluded has totally persuaded me to vote for Hillary. She should hire you!After all, she has that 677, 000 she got from Goldman Sachs just sitting in the bank.Stupid democracy! People voting for the candidates they prefer!</comment>

<comment>Vote for whoever you want. I will exercise my right to NOT vote for this stinking turkey of a candidate. Bernie Sanders is a loon and his supporters are all fools.Won't be the first time a bunch of lemmings marched towards a cliff, shouting "the future belongs to us!"</comment>

<comment>Won't be the first time a bunch of lemmings marched towards a cliff, shouting "the future belongs to us!"Actually it will be the first l--I know of no such event as you describe. Putting aside the fact that lemmings don't talk. I don;t know of any instances of voters shouting the future belongs to us while falling off a cliff. Do you?You should consider laying off the hyperbole and using your brain</comment>

<comment>Not to mention that lemmings jumping off a cliff is a hoax created by Disney. The filmmakers actually threw the poor animals off the cliff. Yeah, family entertainment.http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/ind...</comment>

<comment>The country has serious problems as a result of the extreme wealth concentration at the top. The working class now must resort to welfare to make ends meet. The middle class is vanishing. The young are now starting life with tens of thousands of dollars in educational debt. None of this is self-delusion.If anyone is deluded, it's those who insist everything is fine and that the only thing we need is a "realist" in the White House who will nod and agree to every neoliberal corporatist idea that worsens life for ordinary Americans.</comment>

<comment>His opponent is a pinata filled with speaking fees.It isn't hard to understand his appeal standing next to her.</comment>

<comment>Wow, these guys are joining such former New Hampshire victors as Paul Tsongas, Pat Buchanan, H. Clinton '08, Gary Hart, and Henry Cabot Lodge. Now nothing can prevent them from matching these illustrious predecessors' achievements.</comment>

<comment>bernie sanders is joining these guys former winners of hew hampshirebarack obama jimmy carterlyndon johnsonjohn kennedy</comment>

<comment>Yeah, your guys and my guys... so let's average them together and the conclusion is:winning New Hampshire absolutely, undeniably, means you may or may not win the nomination-- and that is, of course, exactly what *losing* New Hampshire also means.(By the way: Obama won New Hampshire only as an incumbent. The first time he LOST New Hampshire. So if you want to claim Obama as an example of the importance of winning New Hampshire, you also need to acknowledge him as an example of how crucial it is that you LOSE New Hampshire if you want to get the nomination).</comment>

<comment>This may be Sanders only primary victory. Sanders is a candidate of the white middle class. He has no traction with the Democratic party's African-American, Latino and female base, young or old. And the Sanders campaign has made no effort to reach out to them. Sanders' supporters misogynistic remarks about Hillary Clinton antagonize independent and working-class female voters.</comment>

<comment>is that a clinton issued post...it is scripted...pretty sure it is do they pay you the going rate of 4 cents per postif not you should ask for it</comment>

<comment>Nope, I am not part of the Clinton campaign. The Sanders campaign just reminds me too much of the Gene McCarthy campaign. And if it sounds scripted, it's because the indifference of the Sanders campaign to non-white and working class voters is a colossal blind spot.</comment>

<comment>Ah, the Eugene McCarthy canard.  As I recall, the party went with the establishment candidate that year instead of the one who appealed to young voters.  Remind me how that general election went?</comment>

<comment>I actually like Sanders, but I don't think he has a chance of winning in November. And his inability to connect with non-voters is a red flag.</comment>

<comment>How can you say Sanders is indifferent to working class voters???</comment>

<comment>The upcoming primaries will tell the tale. I actually like Sanders, but I don't think he could win in November. And his supporters are mostly middle and upper middle class white men.</comment>

<comment>Don't attribute the misogyny of anonymous posters to Sanders supporters.The real supporters don't go negative, they focus on the economic issues destroying the middle class.</comment>

<comment>Agree 100%. I support Sanders, but will vote for HRC if/when she gets the nom. Her gender does not matter to me in the slightest. The only thing I care about is what she will do for what's left of the working class.The problem is, she is too deeply in the pocket of the banksters who wrecked the world economy in 2007, made us bail them out and give them bonuses, and have only entrenched their positions since then. They are thieves and scumbags and should be in jail. I don't think HRC will even try to change any of that, and they will eventually wreck the economy again.</comment>

<comment>We bailed out the banks because without them functioning we don't have an economy. Some banks used parts of their bailout to write bonus checks, which sucked. But blaming our politicians for rescuing the economy is not helpful.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I know why we bailed the banksters out. They had us over a barrel. But no one got punished -- in fact, they were rewarded for their bad behavior -- and nothing changed. Which means that sooner or later it will happen again.So it should be understood why some people might not have confidence in a candidate whose husband facilitated that eventual economic meltdown, by repealing Glass-Steagall and enacting the CFMA.</comment>

<comment>Sanders was up in Harlem this morning. I think there are some "African-American, Latino and female base, young or old" there.</comment>

<comment>Yet even without reaching out to them, he won 49% of them.Ha, ha, pure fantasy! The working class doesn't take offense at stuff like that. They take offense at their bosses shorting their hours.</comment>

<comment>Like it isn't misogynist to say that "there's a special place in hell" for women who don't support other women -- at least the women that Madeleine Albright thinks they should support.There's a special place in hell for Madeleine Albright.</comment>

<comment>Meanwhile - Hillary is now campaigning with the mothers of Trayvon and Eric Garner in SC. Subtle!</comment>

<comment>yeah but eric garner's daughter is a bernie supporterbernie has young blacks ...the future is colorless and genderless</comment>

<comment>Good!  It's about time the Dem party make a stand for the Black vote.</comment>

<comment>"bernie has young blacks"___Hee hee.</comment>

<comment>Actually the prisons have them.</comment>

<comment>It don't matter. Half the barbershop is voting for Trump anyway. He's the only one who will make America Great again. And America is black people too. We know that Trump knows that unlike some other Republicans.</comment>

<comment>What practical steps has Trump outlined to "make America great again"? Building a giant wall, when more than half of undocumented immigrants arrived here at airports? Starting a trade war with China, or a real war with Iran? Forcing people to say "Merry Christmas"?Seriously, what doable proposal has Trump given, in over six months' of nonsensical jabber?</comment>

<comment>Hillary told us insiders in the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy that the fix was in in the Fifth precinct, as Debbie the Fish and Gloria the Duck were gonna make sure the Bernie supports knew what was good for them.  Seeing as how Hillary didn't pull it off, we getting worried about our 'investments.'</comment>

<comment>Bringing the hate as usual.</comment>

<comment>That alone should terrify her. One of her biggest points was that Sanders couldn't win over non-white voters.</comment>

<comment>Time to come back to the GOP Robert, as you cant vote for a Socialist who's proposals will never fly!</comment>

<comment>Oh, no, not yet! I'll see what happens in November first.</comment>

<comment>HA HA HA .... THE RACIST DEMOCRATS ARE GOING TO BE STUCK WITH A FILTHY COMMUNIST</comment>

<comment>In much the same way your capslock appears to be stuck.</comment>

<comment>Poor feller can only manufacture his joy, now that nihilism has become Republicanism.</comment>

<comment>read this if you want in depth truth about superdelegatesA: Here’s why it doesn’t matter: Superdelegates have never decided a Democratic nomination. It would be insane, even by the corrupt standards of the Democratic National Committee, if a small group of party elites went against the will of the people to choose the presidential nominee.After Sanders' Big Win in New Hampshire, Establishment Figures Want to Scare You with Superdelegates. Here's Why It's Bullshithttp://www.pastemagazine.com/a...</comment>

<comment>As a former republican from the midwest I am certain that Clinton cannot win the general election. No one here, man or woman, believes in her. People will not, can not, suffer anymore business as usual so Trump WILL clean her clock (recent polls agree BTW). Sanders is the only one with the credibility and experience and consistent record of being on the side of the electorate to sway moderate and conservative voters. They respect his honesty. Nominating Hillary is surrender to Republican control of the Executive branch and by extension the Judicial. Either vote for the better candidate or drink the Kool-Aid, democrats</comment>

<comment>Killary needs a new wig to be able to attract more voters.Given the polling, I would tell her that a trump wig is her best shot.</comment>

<comment>Bernie won because he is by far the better candidate--specific on reforms.  Don't forget that Rodham, his opponent, is not likeable, mercenary, and untrustworthy--aside from the fact that she has all the public persona of a wet noodle.  Sorry, radfems, your gal is not up to snuff.  The vagina monologues will have to wait another 4 years at least.  As for regular feminists, like me, Bernie's the man.</comment>
