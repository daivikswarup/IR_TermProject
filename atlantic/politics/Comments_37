<comment>It's hard not to feel the irony - "I can't do my job because I'm too worried about keeping it."</comment>

<comment>This is why America is uniquely paralyzed and dysfunctional, and will ultimately collapse.Constant churn of elections, every year, at near-random times. As a result someone is *always* running for re-election, and someone will *always* say "next year will be a better time for this bill".</comment>

<comment>Unique? This is sadly normal.</comment>

<comment>For *America*. It's not normal in most of the larger countries in the world. Countries with a presidential system like ours always end up like this - completely dysfunctional. Until they collapse into an orgy of blood and starvation.</comment>

<comment>It's normal in other countries too. Belgium didn't even have a government for months.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but they solve their problems and move on. We *can't* solve ours in a timely fashion. Things just keep lurching from crisis to crisis...</comment>

<comment>Anyone standing in the way of this bill for the sake of reelection should be required to do so from Leavenworth.  You want to wait it out?  Fine - step right this way.</comment>

<comment>Half of all calendar years have a congressional election with all the house and a third of the Senate up for reelection. If you can't get anything done then...</comment>

<comment>When Ayotteâ€™s in a room alone the question still get's asked; who's the smartest one in the room.  Yet it never gets answered....</comment>

<comment>Justice system is a mess. Has been for years with people getting put in jail for ridiculous amounts of time for what seems like trivial offenses then others like some cops who kill unarmed citizens who walk away scott free! The whole system needs a good shake up and when cops are accused of a shooting death it shouldn't go before a grand jury as that usually comes out in favor of the cops no matter what the video evidence may show and that's is totally disgraceful. No one is above the law not even the boys in blue whose motto is to protect and serve not shoot and kill and walk away a free man.</comment>
