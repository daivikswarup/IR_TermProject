<comment>Its perfectly sensible to sort out our political parties by race. Race is the fundamental social, cultural, and genetic difference that separates people. Ideological differences are not really all that important.</comment>

<comment>Race is most significantly an ideological difference. Population genetic differences, and their phenotypic expression, between racial groups are miniscule relative to differences within racial groups. And metrics for innate ability overlap so heavily that they are meaningless as differentiators. That means race for all practical purposes is a social construct.</comment>

<comment>How many Blacks get skin cancer? How many Whites get sickle cell? How can you believe that the differences between members of the same race are greater than the differences between the races? What planet do you live on?</comment>

<comment>You're using a genetic disease to justify racism?  Sickle cell anemia arose from exposure to malaria.  Having one copy of the gene gives partial immunity to malaria, but having two copies causes sickle cell anemia, which interferes with oxygen transportation in the blood. It is very painful and leads to a shortened lifespan.   The gene is present in populations other than African -- for instance, it's found in India, the Arabian peninsula, and the eastern Mediterranean -- that were exposed to endemic malaria.  In other words, it doesn't say jack-diddly about race, since not all black people carry this gene while numerous non-blacks do.And ... wait for it ... being part of a population that carries sickle cell trait DOES NOT MAKE YOU SUBHUMAN.  it simply means that your children are more susceptible to this disease.  </comment>

<comment>These are not differences with disruptive social consequences. They're not differences that lead to identification as the 'other'. Looking at the big picture, Homo (not-so) sapiens, we're all very much alike. I live in the real world where we're about 2-3% genetically different than the great apes. The differences within the human species that are used as an excuse for disparate treatment are actually just that an excuse.</comment>

<comment>You realize "race" is just a human construct based on one particular trait (skin pigmentation). There are literally thousands of other traits that make up a human.There are many white ppl who are genetically closer to certain black ppl then they are to other certain white ppl and vice versa.</comment>

<comment>But then what do you do with hispanics and latinos?</comment>

<comment>Latinos can be Black, Guerro, Mestizo, East Indian or any other combination thereof. The literal description is national origin from a Spanish speaking culture. Latinos tend to segregate by race, too.</comment>

<comment>Okay, got it -- we can sort Latinos (and spanish speakers, or hispanics) by race.Now what about the "Asians" do they go into the "black party," the "white party," or the "other party"</comment>

<comment>The Irish used to be "black."  So were Italians, Slavs, Spaniards, and even southern Germans.</comment>

<comment>Lol! You sir are an idiot.  The term 'Black Irish' has nothing to do with skin color, you jack@ss. It is a reference to the dark haired, pale skinned phenotype within the people of Irish origin. Imagine a red-head with black hair.</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about the social status of the Irish, not their skin color.  That's why "black" is in scare quotes.  Everyone knows (or should know) that the Irish once faced tremendous discrimination in America. Remember the old signs "No Irish Need Apply"?  Read the book "How the Irish Became White" for a more full discussion.My larger point is that ethnic groups which we now view as "white" were once considered to be anything but, proving the idea of racially based political parties to be useless and ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>I think we both got that but black Irish was as we both described. Yes it is an American tradition to denigrate the latest bunch of immigrants whatever their ethnicity. Muslims are becoming the new Hispanics.</comment>

<comment>Wait a minute are you saying that Courageousmisterj's idea of racially defined parties is unworkable?</comment>

<comment>Black Irish was not originally used as a slur as it was against other nationalities. It was a description of their dark brunette or black hair colour coupled with grey or blue eyes. As opposed to the more common reddish hair,paler skin and green or blue eyes. It could be applied to most of the Gaelic tribes' variations but usually just to the Irish.</comment>

<comment>There is no Latino race. Or if you insist there is then there is also a European race (by geography) or an English race (by language). What is real is that we are biologically predisposed to have an aversion (dislike, fear)  to the other. We are very good at finding ways to label the other. So we make up social constructs like race and justify them in this case by population genetic differences.</comment>

<comment>Definitely.</comment>

<comment>Different referents: turnout much greater than prior turnout, while number of actual attendees small relative to those eligible to attend.</comment>

<comment>At the end of 2015 there were just under 500,000 registered Republicans in Nevada, about 75,000 showed up to caucus.  Turnout was only 15%.  it's a record, but the actual turnout is very low.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps in the past it was lightly attended.</comment>

<comment>It's only the 3rd set ( I think) of Nevada caucuses that have been held this early. I think they might have had primaries before but definitely later in the cycle. So the turnout was higher than it had been before but still much lower as a percentage of the electorate than other states with longer histories of caucuses. Feel free to correct me if this is wrong but I heard a lot of pundits mention something like this.</comment>

<comment>Trump has won over Republican skeptics with his feistiness and his backbone, continuing to stand up on particular issues like immigration, terrorism and trade, despite taking withering fire. He shows his ability to stand his ground and shrug off Political Correctness in the media. Likewise, he'll be able to take the fight to Hillary and the Democrats as well. The fact that he's self-funding also makes him stand out uniquely.</comment>

<comment>Self-funding his campaign would bankrupt him, but Trump is no stranger to that process.</comment>

<comment>Trump is actually quite brilliant -- he's running all his awareness off of earned media--or reporting done news organizations on him rather than paid advertising by him.</comment>

<comment>Which worked fine when he only had to appeal to one state at a time.  Once Hillary starts running adds against him in multiple states, and networks start giving equal time to both him and Hillary he's not going to be able to rely on freebies.</comment>

<comment>that's nice.http://dailycaller.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>When Trump gets his hands on the emails showing Hillary and Huma (wife of Anthony sextext Weiner)  Have a lesbian relationship it's over for Hillary. People will vote for a woman President but not a Bisexual or Lesbian one . Bernie Sanders is the only option</comment>

<comment>Well, we all know what you jerk off to now.</comment>

<comment>Trump has gotten essentially all his advertising for free - he knows how to work the media. As for bankruptcies, nothing ventured is nothing gained, and he's at least had the audacity to take risks, even if not all of those risks worked. At least the guy has some gumption to try - better than Obama's conflated "community organizing" crap.</comment>

<comment>He's not self funding, you are in a fantasy world."Trump’s campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015, according to the latest Federal Election Commission records. Trump put in $12.8 million of that himself. The remaining $6.6 million came from individual contributions, which federal law caps at $2,700 per candidate per election."</comment>

<comment>That's still better than selling yourself to the shadowy PACs. Even Bernie with his forest of tiny contributors is better than Hillary or the other mainstream candidates, who've all been bought up by the PACs. With power comes corruption, and the world's most powerful democracy has naturally been corrupted by these PACs, which exist to wield disproportionate influence (and perhaps even all-powerful influence) over the democratic setup.Trump is a genius who has completely bypassed the political stranglehold of the PACs by getting effectively all his advertising for free, while others were stuck paying tens of millions for theirs. As a natural instinctive negotiator, Trump easily saw how to exploit the premise of this system, and has parlayed it into a very successful campaign. Who among his rival candidates would have even thought of such an idea, let alone attempted it? None of them have the nerve that he does, nor the experience to confidently to so.Trump is a political pioneer with a highly original style all his own.</comment>

<comment>What Trump is shrugging off is common courtesy and civility not political correctness. That his stump speeches are completely devoid of substance is just icing on the cake.</comment>

<comment>Oh, of course, allowing people to illegally enter the country is extending "common courtesy and civility"A wall sounds like a solid enough substance to me. "Icing on the cake" is trying to position yourself as the new Republican JFK or Obama - just superficiality, not substance.</comment>

<comment>Trump did not redefine the Republican Party. The GOP redefined itself with the rise of the tea-party within its ranks which meant the open acceptance of racial and religious prejudices, rudeness towards women, bombast of ignorance in international relations, etc. Trump as an opportunist picked up these trends in the GOP and is publicly and shamelessly running with it for the GOP nominee for president - the chicken has come home to roost.</comment>

<comment>Liberals have been saying for years that working class Republicans should stop voting for social issues and start voting for economic issues. Why couldn't they see that Trumponomics would have more appeal among the working class than Clintonomics?</comment>

<comment>Trumponomics are more appealing, as long as you don't ask for specifics, like who actually benefits from his tax cut plan and where the money for it comes from (hint: all borrowed from the grandkids, as usual.) That's why he's especially appealing to the least economically sophisticated voters. As well as the truly rich, of course, like him, who get all the benefit from it.http://www.slate.com/blogs/mon...http://www.economist.com/news/...https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>His economic plan is protectionism. How can a very educated person like yourself not notice that?</comment>

<comment>His applause points are protectionism. Follow the money, though, and it's redistribution upward, like every other Repub Presidential candidate.There's not much plausible in his protectionism, because it all relies on other nations accepting his bullying to take a worse deal than they're now getting. Maybe he can get a tiny shift in that direction, but not much, because there's not much in it for the other nations. They'll just say no, and when he threatens to raise tariffs on what they export to us (never mind that that'd be illegal under the GATT treaty we're signatory to, as well as other treaties, so he legally can't), they'll threaten to raise tariffs on the things we export that they buy, like food and technology and movies and aircraft. And we're back to Smoot-Hawley, and the Great Depression. </comment>

<comment>It is a deficit-blowing tax plan that absolutely favors the wealthy. No different than any other Republican tax plan.  And you are correct, the low educated don't get it, they just scream:  MUSLIM, WALL, MEXICO</comment>

<comment>I hate when I have to upvote you! But a third of your points are dead on. :)</comment>

<comment>Yes, mainstream Democrats didn't do a whole lot to address these problems.  Hence the popularity of Bernie Sanders, who is actually talking about these problems and has plans to solve them.</comment>

<comment>Mainstream Democrats would do a lot more to address these problems if they weren't constantly hindered by the Grand Obstructionist Party. Bernie's plans are totally unattainable at this point in history.</comment>

<comment>Trump won 46% of the hispanic vote in Nevada and he is not running a "Confrontational European style racial nationalism" type of campaign.</comment>

<comment>They smear Trump again at the end of TFA with the phrase "party of racial backlash".Yup, progressives cannot go five minutes without cackling "racist, racist" like a demented petshop parrot.</comment>

<comment>Prove a large slice of the Republican party to not be racists and we will stop.  It's so obviously clear and it shows up in poll after poll after poll.  It is what it is.  Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Can't prove a negative.</comment>

<comment>Keep acting like douchebags with your "racist, racist" yapping like a cocker spaniel.Trump's support keeps growing as new voters tired of your PC BS keep registering to vote - faster than you guys can register illegals.</comment>

<comment>in my minds eye i always pictured them more like the seagulls from finding nemo, except instead of food it's whenever they see something they disagree with."RACIST, RACIST, RACIST"</comment>

<comment>I'm confused.  Has Trump backed down on any of the crazy things he's said about Muslims?</comment>

<comment>You are in some absolute dream world.BTW, do you know the Hispanic turnout in Nevada?  It comprised 1.5% of total voters, so his Hispanic constituency was approximately 0.75% of the total votes.   Since there were 75,216 total votes, Trump got a great big total of about 600 Hispanic votes.if you don't think he's been running a racist campaign you are utterly blind.</comment>

<comment>Oh please,  any chance Trump gets he trots out 'Merica and the nasty MexiMuslims.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. He won 46% of the Republican hispanic vote. Quite different. 84% of Nevada hispanics are Democrats and Independents. Only 7% of Nevada hispanics voted for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Estimates are that just 100 Latino republican voters attended the caucuses in Nevada (the vast majority of eligible Latino voters go democrat - as Obama's win there in 2012 showed). Saying Trump won 46% of the Hispanic vote is leaving out the very huge caveat that the margin of error is enormous.</comment>

<comment>By "46% of the hispanic vote in Nevada," do you mean all 23 of the 50 registered Republican Hispanics in Nevada who showed up for caucuses?</comment>

<comment>46% of the hispanic Republican vote. Otherwise he is polling terribly among Hispanics in general.</comment>

<comment>No, Trump won 46% of Latino Republicans who bothered to caucus.</comment>

<comment>"...The Nevada caucus was modestly attended (even with record turnout) ...".Comedy gold, Jerry. Comedy gold.  Sure, progressives - spin record turnout as a negative.Oh - it's definitely modestly attended by DEMOCRATS compared to 2008http://www.nbcnews.com/politic...The Nevada Republican Party reported Wednesday morning that more than 75,000 voters participated in the contest. While that might not seem like a stunning number in a state with a population of somewhere around three million, that turnout absolutely demolished the participation record from 2012, when only about 33,000 Republican voters showed up to caucus.On the Democratic side, the story has not been as rosy. After notching record turnouts in the 2008 Democratic primaries during the epic battle between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, the party's participation this cycle has fallen short of those numbers in every nominating contest to date.Here are those Democratic turnout numbers:Iowa 2008: 239,972Iowa 2016: 171,109New Hampshire 2008: 288,672New Hampshire 2016: 250,983Nevada 2008: 120,000Nevada 2016: 80,000</comment>

<comment>The majority of the Democrats will be happy with either candidate. They will show up in droves in the general to defeat whichever horror the GOP ends up nominating.</comment>

<comment>Keep telling yourself that. Inconveniently for you - Dem primary turnout is WAY down compared to 2008.  You don't have Obama to drive your turnout.</comment>

<comment>Other than splitting the GOP into several pieces, I think what scares the "elites" the most is that Trump destroys the carefully crafted narrative of the "conservative movement". Instead of strict and reverent adherence to the so called conservative principles that significantly reward the top earners in the nation, Trump peels off 40% of the Republican base by offering them a decent job and payback to the forces that they believe  have put the American middle class in extremis. Moreover, Trump and his successors can revisit that theme each election, blaming its failure on liberals, immigrants, whoever, in the same way the old school GOP did with the ever escalating anti-government and tax cut rhetoric.  Being an optimist. I'm hopeful it wont take almost 40 years for voters to determine they have been deceived this time.</comment>

<comment>Of course, Obama blamed his failures on "Republican obstructionism" - even in his first term when Democrats controlled BOTH houses of Congress AND the Presidency.</comment>

<comment>Nice try.  If you didn't know, and apparently you dont, just having a simple majority in the Senate since 2008 isn't good enough. You need 60 votes to pass any legislation since Obama took office , enough to force cloture and a floor vote. Just like Mitch said he would require:"The correct count of how many bills have been filibustered during Obama's presidency is: approximately all of them. That's what it means to have a 60-vote Senate, which is what Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Republicans declared as soon as Obama was elected. Almost every measure and, until Majority Leader Harry Reid and the Democrats invoked the nuclear option last fall, almost every nomination, had to have 60 or more votes to pass. That's a filibuster." Bloomberg Politics"Prior to Obama there were 68 nominations successfully blocked, in the entire history of the country.  This administration has had 79 nominations blocked, in other words instead of 49% as the Democrats had claimed, nearly 54% of all nominations ever blocked have been his nominations." PolitiFactBefore you say it, the ACA was passed using the reconciliation procedure in the Senate. Look it up.Your party is dying.  Time to move to the "acceptance phase" and move on.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, if nothing else, the refusal to NOT filibuster the judicial appointments in the first two years is pretty clear evidence of obstructionism from day one.</comment>

<comment>What a weird way to die - moving from Dem control of Congress in 2008 to Republican control in 2014.I'll take it. More dying please.</comment>

<comment>the republican establishment is dying, not the party. quite the opposite, judging by the high republican turnout and the low democratic turnout this time round.</comment>

<comment>That's what Trump says.But what is Trump's plan?</comment>

<comment>Beats me. Other than "making America great again", presumably because he is President,  I dont think he has one..</comment>

<comment>I've noticed that Trump and his fanboys never go into any detail about his policy "ideas". Never anything more than empty slogans and memes.</comment>

<comment>You mean "Making America White Again," don't you?</comment>

<comment>Goes without saying.doesn't it?</comment>

<comment>He's going to move America to a trucker-hat based economy.</comment>

<comment>The  trucker hats ARE cool. Economies have been based on worse things. </comment>

<comment>It seems to me that Trump is not so much redefining the Republican party as exposing its unspoken agenda. Since Lee Atwater, the GOP has employed the dog-whistle to hint to racist and anti-government and nativist voters that they had a home in the Republican party. Trump has swapped the dog-whistle for a megaphone, that's all. How many Trump supporters have we heard say "I'm so glad he's saying what we've all been thinking".The challenge for the GOP elite is deciding whether or not they want to reject their racist, nativist, anti-government whisper campaign, and become a more moral, ethical party. </comment>

<comment>When you cannot formulate a single idea in your head, just cry "racist".  </comment>

<comment>The Republican's "southern strategy", formulated by Lee Atwater (and carried out by others) to bring white, racist voters into the Republican party, is well-documented and widely accepted. The south (white south) became a Republican stronghold as a result. The GOP has quietly fostered those beliefs of their white southern base, Reagan with his "welfare queens", as one example out of many...</comment>

<comment>Now you could argue that up until the late 1960s, the party that welcomed racist voters was the Democratic party, and you'd be correct. That all changed with LBJ, and the Civil Rights Act. When the GOP realized then that white racists no longer felt at home in the Democratic party, they rolled out the welcome mat...</comment>

<comment>the suggestion being that the democrats no longer have any racists in their ranks?they switched up the skin colors of the racists they accept, they didn't stop welcoming them. it's not a trait unique to white people as racist democrats like to believe.</comment>

<comment>This is a typical right-wing trope that doesn't really fly when you really understand what racism is. Let's take Black Lives Matters, as an example. You probably think that is a racist organization. Why? Because it promotes the interests of black people? Explain that to me and I'll let you know why BLM is not and can't possibly be racist in the way the KKK is racist. There is all the difference in the world. Not saying there can't be black racists, but I am guessing you're confusing racism with bigotry, which is certainly rampant in people of every race and creed on the planet.</comment>

<comment>i'm not going to take lessons on racism from a racist.</comment>

<comment>Well, your open-mindedness should certainly inform anyone reading your comments just how much credibility to give your comments. Apparently, a racist is anyone who disagrees with you about what racism is. Very deep analysis, indeed.</comment>

<comment>yes, that was the joke, i was mocking liberals.</comment>

<comment>Obviously, not all Republicans are racist. At the same time, however, it's disingenuous to suggest that the Trump campaign is not finding significant traction with what racists there are in the party.  Maybe they're simply the xenophobes or the ignorant, but there's a disenfranchised underbelly who have a great deal of hate for their motivation.The South Carolina exit polling was telling.  Trump voters were over two-thirds in favor of returning the Confederate Flag to the Statehouse.  A similar number believes that white people are more likely to be discriminated against than blacks.  Again, perhaps some of these folks are not racists, but you can't honestly say none are."Us against them" messages predicated upon innuendo about "others" is a long utilized, political tool because it does permit bringing racists into the fold without having to come clean about what one's trying to do.  Immigrants of different color are an easy scapegoat.  Even when the unsubstantiated leap is made from seeing more Hispanics in society to the conclusion that they're all "illegal Mexicans" reeks of a racism problem.  Punching down at the underclass as responsible for stagnant wage growth for under-educated natives, merely continues to avoid the true problem - the overclass is positioned to keep taking an increasing share of the nation's wealth (and that we've failed to better educate those natives).Show me real policies from Donnie that address this issue to gain votes, instead of "the presence of those 'other' people is the big problem", and I'll be more likely to consider the notion that racists are not a Trump target audience.</comment>

<comment>I think it's more xenophobia than racism, though there's still some of that too, especially with the retiree crowd. However, it's not very common among younger Republicans. They aren't against Mexicans because they are brown. They are against illegal immigrant Mexicans because they aren't here legally. They might not be aware that most Hispanics are not only here legally, but are third, fourth, or even tenth generation residents of what is now U.S. territory. They aren't against Muslims because of their ethnicity. They're against them because they fear violent Islamist ideology, and don't understand that the vast majority of Muslims reject the Muslim killers called ISIS.There's some misunderstanding among some, but I don't even think a majority hold the above misconceptions. They're just very frustrated and are going with the political winds because those winds, right or wrong, at least have some momentum.</comment>

<comment>"They're against them because they fear violent Islamist ideology, and don't understand that the vast majority of Muslims reject the Muslim killers called ISIS."Fine, then we'll just label it all as prejudice.  They're taking an individual or small subset's view and using it to malign the totality of the group, after all.  The fact remains the same, appealing to, and manipulating, people's ignorant prejudices for power is a vile practice.  Particularly when you're using it as a distraction from where the real problems lie.On some level, I'd almost wish Trump could actually build a wall and deport 11 Million people.  Then folks would see that there's still millions of brown faces left in the crowd, still poor wages for the middle and working classes - quite simply, that nothing has changed.</comment>

<comment>Bingo.  Rounding up all of the Mexicans and Muslims is not going to usher in utopia.  Quite the opposite.</comment>

<comment>It's also possible that the economy would be worse. We'd have 11 million less consumers in a consumer driven economy and many of those people are also taxpayers. Many are paying payroll taxes at least with no hope of benefitting later.</comment>

<comment>What's clear is that it's very unlikely to solve any real problems.  That's what's most troubling when trying to understand the appeal.</comment>

<comment>one thing that progressives seem to have a great deal of difficulty wrapping their heads round is that no one is afraid of islamic terrorism. people are afraid of islamic terrorism much in the way you'd presumably be afraid of dying in a horrific car crash. maybe it's crossed your mind, but is it something you think of regularly?people are not afraid, people are pissed off about the increasing frequency of brutal muslim terrorist attacks and rape gangs, and the "vast majority" of muslims largely doing sweet FA about it. but this makes perfect sense if you read the PEW study which surveyed 30k muslims, finding solid majorities in most islamic countries support sharia law, a legal system which condones the killing of non-muslims, punishes apostasy with death, and extensively details the sexual enslavement of non-muslim women.people are angry that muslims whine about racism and portray themselves as victims while resisting any real attempt to counter the "radicalism," misogyny, anti-semitism, homophobia, racism, etc. inherent in their religion, which they blame for the prejudices they endure.no other minority groups have established a pattern in multiple countries of organized, industrial scale massacres and pedophile gangs, it's only muslims. but yet they insist everyone else is the problem, "islamophobia" forces them to murder jews and rape prepubescent girls.</comment>

<comment>Hey, Mint,I'm afraid that some of the positions you're hearing propounded ARE racist, including assuming that all brown people who speak English with a Spanish accent are illegal immigrants, or that all Muslims are ISIS or terrorists. That's more than a misunderstanding, it is using one's privileged position to make broad judgments about a certain population and justifying both attitudes and policies that are oppressive against those populations, mostly because their assumptions remain unchallenged by the dominant mainstream culture. Probably most of them would be able to acknowledge that a certain Mexican-American or a certain Islamic person they know might not fit their stereotypes, but are still able to convince themselves that these people are anomalies and that "most" Mexican-Americans are illegal and need to be deported. Needless to say, Mr. Trump has quite intentionally gone out to promote and expand on these stereotypical ideas, which most definitely qualifies as racist.One doesn't have to hate all Mexicans or black people to be racist. One only needs to be willing to promote and support policies that oppress people based on race, and operate from attitudes and beliefs that promote such policies.</comment>

<comment>The above poster characterized it better. It's less racism than prejudice.</comment>

<comment>hmm, who do i vote for, trump and the white supremacists who want to fly a flag over a statehouse, or clinton and her islamist friends who want to chop my head off and sexually enslave my girlfriend? it's a tough call.</comment>

<comment>Chop your head off and enslave your girlfriend???? Even Fox News wouldn't suggest such crap from even Hillary. What have you been smoking, dude?</comment>

<comment>yeah unsurprisingly that went over your head.my point was there are extremists on all sides of the political spectrum.</comment>

<comment>Well, perhaps that's what you should have said and I'd agree with you. It sounded more like a cheap shot to imply that Hillary Clinton is a slave to ISIS.</comment>

<comment>When you cannot form a single idea in your head, just cry "build the wall!"</comment>

<comment>Your 'analysis' is about as original and insightful as the latest episode of Modern Family. Do you have any thoughts outside of the mainstream Democratic talking points that we can find literally anywhere else?</comment>

<comment>I have to laugh everytime I hear the Dems keep spewing the old & tired line of Racist, xenophobic nonsense.Everyone knows times have changed. Dems are the new faces of Racism. Their anti-White rhetoric is here consistently and it's not "whispers". It's loud and proud. </comment>

<comment>You know, because white heterosexual Christians have it so hard in this country.</comment>

<comment>So what's your point. The homosexual atheists are so miserable, they have to spread the misery by being racist and hating people not like them. </comment>

<comment>Why do you care what "homosexual atheists" think of you?</comment>

<comment>I did not give it much thought until you told me. Why are they not happy? I do care about that. </comment>

<comment>I'm not going to touch upon the other flat-out wrong implications of your argument in general, but who says that atheists are miserable people in the first place? You do realize we're a very diverse bunch of people, right?</comment>

<comment>Because you all seem to be addicted to 'hating'. It's deep in your psyche or something. If I try to be kind; I'm accused of trying to be 'happy' or they twist my words into something they can attack. Do emotionally stable people do these things? Btw, did you know some people are just born with more endorphins that allow for them to see joy in more things- simple things. </comment>

<comment>Sorry, you're wrong. Atheists 'hate' no more and no less than anyone else.What we *do* as a group tend to believe in is exposing hypocrisy, and preferring logic over faith as a means of navigating the world.Unfortunately, those who are hypocritical, or who prefer faith over logic, tend to take offense to those who call out their hypocrisy or who aren't afraid to call out the silliness of blind faith, and this offense makes them feel hated. They aren't; atheists as a rule have better things to do than hate.</comment>

<comment>Not in my personal experience with them. Agnostics are much nicer and their belief is much more rational to me. Atheists are mean. </comment>

<comment>And yet here an atheist is trying to have a reasonable conversation with you, but you insist on telling him that he's not a nice guy.Whether you can understand my belief is irrelevant; what matters is that I believe the thing, that the thing I believe harms no one, and that the thing I believe in does not impact your ability to believe your thing.</comment>

<comment>Wow, and you're the one accusing others of bigotry? You do realize how ignorant you sound here, don't you, suggesting that "all atheists are alike?" Maybe some nice people you know are atheists, but are afraid to tell you because they've seen how bigoted and unkind you are?</comment>

<comment>Considering that you use homosexuality and atheism as epithets, you belie your own argument right then and there about happiness. </comment>

<comment>Huh- looking deep for something to be mad about. Sad. </comment>

<comment>Do you need to believe that you upset us to counter-balance the lack of power you feel in other realms?I am super happy.  It's beautiful today here.</comment>

<comment>more insults</comment>

<comment>Go ahead, I deserve it.  Lay it on me, but I am going to work now so don't plan on a response.</comment>

<comment>Not only am I NOT mad about anything in general, but I don't have to "look" for anything when your wrong comments are out there front  and center. You're equivocating anger with criticism.</comment>

<comment>Are you sincerely stating that there is not a racist element in the present GOP coalition?</comment>

<comment>Racism will always be with us but true Racism is minimal. Perceptions of people is not a color of skin thing; its actions and words. I 100% know I really really like conservative people of color, as most people do. It's the liberal people we have a problem with, White people maybe even more so. You have it all wrong.</comment>

<comment>"I 100% know I really really like conservative people of color, as most people do."Leaving aside that you have absolutely no basis whatsoever for the "most people do" assertion (not to mention the strawman of "true Racism"), you've just exposed a lot.Fundamentally, you're saying that you're "OK" with people of color, so long as they toe the line of your beliefs.  However, if they dare articulate a different position, ideology, or stand up for what they believe to be right, they're not worthy of your liking or respecting them.  Maybe it's time to turn the fire hoses on, huh?  Clearly, only you know what's good for "those people".</comment>

<comment>Do you notice how the Dems are so vile and hate-filled with Conserv Blacks, &  Conserv Women. They only care about people they can use as their pawns for their power. Btw, by the bitter tone in yours and 'ThunderLizards' stmts, I just think liberals suffer from an addiction to Hate. You don't acknowledge any kindness given with reciprocation. It's just more anger. Cya :)</comment>

<comment>FWIW, I saw no anger in MZale's response, and no kindness in yours.</comment>

<comment>It's to all of you. Thanks for your opinion- lib side-taker. </comment>

<comment>As insults go, that's pretty weak.And as showing kindness goes, it's even worse.(Please note that I am criticizing the behavior and not the speaker. People can have reasonable conversations when they criticize behavior; they cannot have reasonable conversations when they criticize individuals.)</comment>

<comment>Quite a bit of pot calling kettle black going on here. I am always struck by how hate filled Republicans all sound from the politicians to the pundits to their supporters in these forums.</comment>

<comment>What I don't get is the fact that if we sit down next to each other in a diner, we'd never try to say half the nonsense we try to get away with online... but as soon as you put a screen to it, everyone's more than happy to turn into a caricature of themselves. Why is that? Is it that hard to be a decent human being all the time, instead of only face to face?</comment>

<comment>plz stop randomly capitalizing words.  I know that third grade was hard but you capitalize proper nouns and words that start sentences...not every 7th word or the ones you really like.</comment>

<comment>It's social media style- angry person. Sad to just look for any little thing to be aggressed about. </comment>

<comment>I was just trying to help you be taken more seriously.  You Do You.</comment>

<comment>Looks like you are back to insults again.  Are you going to whine again when people insult you?</comment>

<comment>No one's insulting you.  They're being politically incorrect.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense, white people are fair game.  Insult away, we need no safe spaces or "hate speech" laws.</comment>

<comment>The Grammar Hammer has fallen!  Btw, you neglected to capitalize your first sentence and your second "sentence" is a punctuation/grammar nightmare.  No worries though. Everyone gets a participation trophy.</comment>

<comment>Why bother?  Libs are hate filled because they hate themselves, their country and their people.  Always virtue signalling to other libs and various "protected classes" that they are 'Good Whites", they cover their shame of being white with qrotesque tattoos, body piercings and other debasements.  Ever the willing dupe, they make themselves subservient to the whims of SJW group think.  The good news is that they are too selfish to breed.</comment>

<comment>You're filtering reality here to tell yourself a story, I think.Says the left-of-center Caucasian atheist with no tattoos, piercings, etc., a couple of jobs, a couple of polite, considerate, and high-achieving children, no hate at all within him, and a sorry habit of thinking we can improve the world if we work together, but we'll burn the whole thing down if we can't put a stop to the nonsense of allowing  class and religion and race and nationality and political party to become more important than the fact that we have problems as a species and as a country that we can't solve if we're perpetually divided against one another.That ain't self-hate. It isn't being ashamed of who I am. It's acknowledging that the "Love Thy Neighbor" concept underlying Christianity  is a pretty damn solid way to go through life, regardless of whether one is a believer or not.Go out, get to know a couple of us "Libs" beyond the preconceptions. Have a couple-three beers or cups of coffee together, talk about your local team and what's in the movie theaters and whose boss is effing who over harder. People on the left, people on the right, we all want our teams to win, our roads to be paved, our taxes to be affordable, our kids to do better than us. Get to know a few of the Other and maybe you'll start to see that.'Cuz otherwise? If we keep talking about imaginary people as if they're real, if we keep letting all the bullshit get between us, there's really nowhere for this conversation--or this nation--to go but down.</comment>

<comment>I have plenty of Libs as friends, that's how I know the type very well.  They usually live in Lilly white areas, send their kids to private schools and want everyone else to pay for their pet projects, but rarely put their own money where their mouth is.   Their definition of "diversity" is only skin deep.  No differing opinions are tolerated.   I know the type...because I used to be you...right down to the atheism, college education,  children, and the smug sense of superiority.Parting thoughts...loving your neighbor does not mean letting him squat in your house forever while trashing it, molesting your children and demanding that you pay for their expenses.  That's where your philosophy leads, my friend.  Just look at what is going on in Europe if you don't think that's the case.And ask yourself this....if diversity/multiculturalism is so wonderful, why is no other nation on earth seeking to implement it other than countries infected with what is effectively "cultural marxism?"  Even regular marxist states like China want nothing to do with it.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure you weren't me. For one thing, you think I feel a 'smug sense of superiority' - maybe you did, back when you were "me", but I don't. I'm lucky as hell to be where I am. What small successes I've had in life are, in large part, due to social programs like tuition assistance and social security that were there when I needed them. That's where my "lib" desire for a useful government comes from - the money that was invested in me has paid off in spades, and because I'm *not* superior I believe it can do the same for others as well.Your straw-man construction is ridiculous; it's completely possible to be socially accepting and considerate and also not allow law-breaking.As for your last attempt at a point... if you're a believer in that white-supremacist, "Africa for the Blacks, Asia for the Asians," nonsense, there's nothing I can say to change your mind. But maybe I'm misreading you, in which case I'll say that, as little as you might like it, this country's entire reason for existence *is* its multiculturalism. From the first explorers who came here from multiple points of origin, to the first settlers who came here seeking freedom from the persecution they suffered at home, all the way up to the modern day with our fully integrated armed services, we're founded upon the concept (stop me if you've heard this) that all men are created equal. That's who we are. And, regardless of the doom and gloom pushed by Republican politicians, our multiculturalism has given us the strength and flexibility to succeed to economic, military, and technological heights never before seen in the history of humanity.</comment>

<comment>You are again conflating "racism" with "bigotry". A lot of racists have no problem with black or brown people they actually know, but still make gross generalizations and justifications for harmful actions taken against black people just because they're black. The fact that you don't "hate all black people" doesn't mean you're not a racist. After all, the oldest racist cliche in the book is, "Some of my best friends are black!"</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the thread, Mr. Luntz!</comment>

<comment>Ooh - why? He's like 200 lbs heavier and more dweebish than me.</comment>

<comment>Showing once again your commitment to rationality and civility in communication...</comment>

<comment>"Anti-white rhetoric" (whatever THAT means) is not the same as racism. Racism is the intentional, systematic domination of one race by another, as well as the system of thinking and beliefs that justify such domination as "natural" and essential. Saying that "white people are racists," for example, is bigoted, but not racist. Saying, "A lot more black people than white people are stopped by police for no reason" is not racist at all, as it is simply a statement of facts as ascertained by statistics available to anyone who cares to look.Racism is often defined by the Right as "anything you say that suggests that any white person may be racist." The implicit assumption is that racism is a thing of the past, which is, in my view, as ridiculous an assertion as "cows can fly now."If you look at which candidate right-wing neo-Nazi hate groups are most likely to endorse, I would suggest that it is NOT going to be a Democrat. In fact, the person they seem to be most excited about in this race is, shockingly, DONALD TRUMP. And Trump would not even repudiate their support.So much for Democrats being the new face of racism.</comment>

<comment>White Supremist groups are making robocalls for Trump. David Duke past Grand Wizard of the KKK is talking him up on his radio show and groups are using his campaign as a recruiting tool. Democrats are not the only ones hearing racism and/or bigotry in his campaign.</comment>

<comment>The GOP elites have been pretty united against Trump actually.I put more of the blame on people who call everything racist. It's like the boy who cried wolf--when you call obviously race-neutral things like tax cuts racist, and when you equate "anti-government" with racism (wasn't the civil rights movement opposing the government?), you lose credibility when trying to oppose actually racist policies.</comment>

<comment>I don't know who's calling everything racist. Not me. It's quite clear that the GOP welcomed racists into the party in the 1970s, and have adopted planks and policies that mollify racists. But I never said that tax cuts for the wealthy are motivated by racism. They're not. The civil rights movement was partly a movement of civil disobedience. And there was a radical faction, for a period in the late 1960s, that supported taking up arms. But that push for armed rebellion was never part of the Democratic platform, in fact Democratic politicians rejected it outright (and were as much the targets as were Republicans). The GOP, with its support for the NRA and its radical interpretation of the 2nd amendment, is fostering armed revolt. Republican politicians encouraging "2nd amendment solutions" are radically anti-government. </comment>

<comment>If your preferred solution to 11+ million illegal immigrants in the country is to simply wave the federal magic wand and turn them into 11+ million legal immigrants, and you think any other view than that is racist, then of course you're going to see Trump and his supporters as racists.  But no Trump voter, and not even any likely or possible Trump voter, is going to be listening to you because you frankly speak a different language.  There are plenty of non-racist reasons--social, political, and economic--to not want 11+ million illegal immigrants to remain in the country, legally or illegally.As for trade, Trump often doesn't sound so different from Bernie Sanders (or maybe you think he's a racist, too).  He's a free trade skeptic.  You have to have some serious tunnel vision to make that into a racist issue.And as for "anti-government," I don't think you've actually listened to Trump speak even once.  The rest of the conservative movement and Republican establishment is having fits about Trump most specifically because he is the most pro-government Republican to seriously threaten to take the nomination since the pre-Reagan days (you really probably have to go back to Eisenhower, maybe even longer).</comment>

<comment>And where should the American citizens that are the children of many illegal immigrants go? Left here in the foster system? Kicked out with their parents and American citizenship?FWIW we call Trump a racist not because he doesn't want illegal immigrants but because he generalizes an entire group of people as "rapists, murderers and drug dealers" and the like. This is the definition of prejudice.</comment>

<comment>I never said that I wanted to wave a magic wand to cure mmigration. And I agree that there are social, political and economic ramifications with immigration (many of them positive). I said Trump is a racist, and many of his followers love him for that. Trump brands immigrants as rapists, killers, drug runners and violent criminals. None of which is true, the rates of crime among immigrants is much lower than among American citizens. Trump wants to ban all Muslims from enterng the country. That's hardly a nuanced position, but yes, that is a different language than I and most Americans speak. Trump is not engaging us in a discussion of the economic and social ramifications of immigration. He's playing the racist demagogue, and throwng raw meat to his racist followers. There's no way to pretty that up.I don't think free trade is a racist issue. Never even mentioned free trade. And certainly wouldn't in conjunction with racism. </comment>

<comment>Not exactlyToo much of the american right is obsessed with trivial ideals like "small government" or "the constitution"What trump is doing is a normalization of right-wing politics - shifting it to directly conform with nationalism. Racism, xenophobia, and nativism are basically snarl words for "normal" in most parts of the world. This only feels unusual to you because america is not used to nationalism</comment>

<comment>Um, huh? I am confused, but hold on, I need to chant, "USA, USA, USA!". Okay, I feel better, let's get back to your point. So what is this about America not being used to nationalism? And the rest of the world is? What "rest of the world" is more nationalistic than good ol' America? We invented nationalism, and it's red-white-and-blue and has chevies and apple pies too! Although, I keep hearing the strains of John Prine, reminding us that "your flag decal won't get you into heaven anymore..." </comment>

<comment>There is a difference between "nationalism" and racist/fascist ideology. Trump is "nationalist" only for white people, and white racists support him because that's his message. If you accept that only white people are citizens of the USA, you can call it "nationalism," but if you consider any other people to be citizens, it's nothing more than racist, xenophobic demagoguery. It's the difference between saying "Buy American!" (nationalist) and "Don't buy from black people" (racist). Don't know if that kind of racism exists in your country, but it sure does here.</comment>

<comment>If Hillary wins the nomination, Millenials stay home.   Not saying the hate Trump has engendered amongst minorities won't kill him but it may be closer than people think.</comment>

<comment>Even though Trump has reeled in the low-educated voter, I'd still take him over Cruz and Rubio, it's not even close.</comment>

<comment>Trump hasn't redefined anything; the Republican Party has worked hard for decades to bring itself to this very place. Rather than change with the times, as any business that wishes to stay afloat must do, the party has instead applied its efforts to turning out higher percentages of its shrinking base through increasingly hysterical, knee-jerk rhetoric. Now, it would appear, that base has figured out what has been true for many years, that the party really has nothing to offer it, and seeks a hero.Trump has simply been willing to rush in where even Republicans fear to tread. His message is an over the top version of what the party has been doling out all along, a cartoonish version of the Big Lie.</comment>

<comment>You can keep telling yourself that if you want, right up to Trumps inauguration.The truth is that Trump is something new. Or rather, he is something we haven't had since Pat Buchanan in the 90s, or Eisenhower.</comment>

<comment>An angry, blow-hard white guy?  There's been plenty of those.  Where have you been?</comment>

<comment>It certainly takes one to know one. Don't it, White Boy?</comment>

<comment>You're responding to my posts!  Does this mean I'm serious enough for you?</comment>

<comment>That rumbling we hear is Eisenhower turning over in his grave at being likened to Pat Buchanan.</comment>

<comment>If Eisenhower was alive today, he'd basically be considered to be even further to the left than most democrats (well, except for the whole "let's go overthrow other democratically elected governments" thing).</comment>

<comment>Eisenhower did Operation Wetback!</comment>

<comment>Deported a lot of U.S. citizens, too. Hope Trump is a little more careful.</comment>

<comment>And FDR locked up the Japanese and some Germans in WWII. Even good presidents make mistakes. They just usually maker fewer than the bad ones.</comment>

<comment>In aggregate, he would be considered more leftist than most democrats today. But yeah, Operation Wetback would count against him too.</comment>

<comment>He added Eisenhower in an edit, likely because he realized that people like Pat Buchanan really aren't that uncommon.</comment>

<comment>And Trump!</comment>

<comment>My thoughts exactly! Eisenhower is about as similar to Pat Buchannan as an ice cream sundae is to sauerkraut!</comment>

<comment>You are badly maligning Eisenhower the last great Republican president, although in hindsight Bush 1 wasn't all that bad.</comment>

<comment>Only if compared to his son!</comment>

<comment>Trump has expertly carved up the Republican Party, and with a combination of hard work and luck, has wound up with the biggest chunk (35-45%). If any candidate wins at this point, it's likely to be Trump, and if Trump doesn't win, it'll be because of a brokered convention.Whatever the case, the GOP seems bound for defeat in November.</comment>

<comment>Trump is showing who a lot of Republicans are:  people who drank the GOP's kool-aid all their lives and then woke up to realize they had been had by their own party elites. Trump isn't going away, and he won't be overcome by the likes of Cruz and Rubio.  In all likelihood, he will pick up a lot of votes in the general election from disaffected Democrats who are in the same economic demographic as his Republican supporters. If in the process he destroys the Dem-lite GOP, so much the better.</comment>

<comment>And don't think Trump isn't eying the public trough. He knows there are many who are 'easily had'.</comment>

<comment>Whatever happened to the good old-fashioned, Rockefeller, even moderate Republicans who were willing to compromise to get things done and who were still functional and reasonable people at the end of the day?</comment>

<comment>They're all gone.  The purge began with the Reagan devolution.  It ended with the Tea Party.</comment>

<comment>Who says it's over yet?</comment>

<comment>The Tea Party eats its own.</comment>

<comment>It's really telling when today's democrats are yesterday's Moderate Republicans. </comment>

<comment>You could technically say that it began as far back as 1964; that's when Goldwater formulated the Southern Strategy in its earliest form.</comment>

<comment>Ironically it is probably Hillary Clinton who has the closest philosophical position as N. Rockefeller.</comment>

<comment>Some of Obama's positions are to the right of Richard Nixon's.  He's basically an Eisenhower Republican with contemporary social attitudes.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't mind a little bit more Ike in our politics.  I like Ike.</comment>

<comment>What's not to like about Ike?</comment>

<comment>Indeed, he is a far cry from being a lefty liberal.</comment>

<comment>Ike would be totally smacked down as a lefty liberal if he ran today. There's no way he'd even be a Republican. He was in favor of strong unions, good wages, the GI Bill and all sorts of "socialist" programming to help make America strong. And the results were apparent in a whole decade plus of an expanding economy during and following his time in office. He would be ashamed of the condition of the Republican Party today.</comment>

<comment>Either her or Bloomberg  (if he chooses to run, that is).</comment>

<comment>The black lives matter pandering sets her apart.  Bloomberg comes closer.</comment>

<comment>Modestly attended - lost me there.</comment>

<comment>Let's say you invite 20 people to your birthday party, and eight people show up.  That's less than half the people you invited, so one could call the response "modest".However, the previous year you invited 20 people and only three showed up.  You got more than twice as many people to come to your party, but still, more than half the people you invited to your party chose to stay home.</comment>

<comment>"Even if Trump, as the nominee, could squeeze out a narrow victory in November by mobilizing more working-class whites he might still disastrously stamp the GOP as a party of racial backlash to the minorities and Millennials irreversibly growing in the electorate"Trump is merely harvesting the fruit that the GOP planted.  It's been the party of racial backlash for decades, from the infamous Southern Strategy to Willie Horton to birtherism.  It's also been the party of backlash to LGBT rights, feminism, contraception and abortion, science, civil rights -- indeed, social change in general.  And it's made a whole bunch of extravagant promises to those who are marginalized by current trends in society -- basically, that it's going to turn the clock back to an idealized past where men were Real Christian Men, women were Real Christian Women, those uppity Others were kept in their places, and America was a Strong Nation (never mind that this past only existed on TV and in nostalgia).While the grievances of the GOP electorate are often legitimate, the GOP had no intention of addressing them (and realistically, no clear way to do it).  But it sure did benefit at the ballot box from making them angry, stoking their resentment, and promising them the moon, then proceding with government of the billionaires, by the billionaires, and for the billionaires.  A classic case of bait and switch.With the ground prepared and the seeds planted, it was only a matter of time before an authoritarian daddy figure arose to reap the anger that the GOP so carefully nurtured.  It's a pity that a party so fond of traditionalism didn't pay attention to the very traditional sayings and proverbs that pointed to this very outcome.  Hoist on their own petard.  Sow the wind, reap the whirlwind.  Be careful what you ask for; you might get it.Unfortunately, they may drag the rest of the country down into the fever swamp with them.</comment>

<comment>The GOP IS the party of racial backlash! That's why Trump is winning, folks!</comment>

<comment>TRUMP will be the next President because TRUMP’s opponents have nothing to offer but their arrogant condescending attitudes towards the voting population. Eminent Domain didn’t stick to TRUMP and neither will groundless tax allegations. These cookie-cutter politicians and their obsolete old-boy establishment handlers are wrong for today’s challenges and tomorrows solutions. Please don’t waste voter’s time and energy trying to make this election about personalities, gender, race, minorities or hatred. Trust in the voters, stop insulting them. The odds are slim to none that other candidates will ever grasp this logic! It’s not complicated. It’s just requires common sense. Too bad common sense is in such short supply these days.Stop blaming TRUMP for other candidate’s and previous government failures. American voters couldn’t care less about party affiliations. Today American voters want to reverse the export of jobs, manufacturing and money out of America. Americans want a health care system that works for ALL Americans. Americans want to deal with terrorism and illegal immigration once and for all. Americans want the right leader with a vision that embraces measurable achievable solutions that focus on taking back America for ALL Americans. The political establishment’s endless disasters, at home and abroad, have failed Americans, not TRUMP. TRUMP will make America great again.On November the 8th the majority of voters will choose TRUMP as their next President. TRUMP surrounds himself with the right people for business and TRUMP will definitely surround himself with the right people as President.  As president, TRUMP will work very hard for ALL Americans repairing America’s domestic and international disasters caused by previous failed governments.</comment>

<comment>How is Trump going to win minorities, democrats and a win back pro-choice women to the Republican party.I am not seeing how you are going to get to a coalition, esp when voting against Trump is also going to be a huge factor.There are not enough movement conservatives in this country to elect a president and that is just a fact.</comment>

<comment>He's less extreme on abortion than Cruz and Rubio. If he'd quit insulting specific women, it would help his case tho.</comment>

<comment>TRUMP: Vote for the candidate who spells his name in ALL CAPS.  It's yet another sign that he's YUUUUUUUGE!</comment>

<comment>Uhh how you gonna deal with terrorism once and for all?</comment>

<comment>This sounds like a Hitler speech. BTW, did you know that Trump kept a copy of Hitler's speeches by his bedside to read at night?</comment>

<comment>Might!!!Thump  = KKK = GOP</comment>

<comment>Hate is not a viable strategy for the Dems this time.</comment>

<comment>trump is not redefining the GOP, it has been the party of Stupid for some time.  He is, however, its best mascot.</comment>

<comment>Dems are the Racists now. It's a new day. Trump peeps are the smart ones - standing up for their beliefs while Dems are the stupid. They will follow Hillary to her prison cell with their vote, or let Al Sharpton tell them how to vote - Sheep. </comment>

<comment>Quite a feat winning dimmest poster on the internet.  How does it feel to be a winner ?</comment>

<comment>Great. I'm good at it IRL. Cya - behind on work.</comment>

<comment>- Excerpt from the novel "Sarah5 In The Land Of Mirrors"</comment>

<comment>You clearly have no idea what a racist really means, unless you mean the right-wing definition of Racist: anyone who makes white people uncomfortable by bringing up race as an issue.</comment>

<comment>Dems are the only ones bringing up phony race stuff. And it's all anti-white garbage or calling us racists because we think with fact and reasoning and liberals think with emotions. Too many crybabies.</comment>

<comment>"Bringing up phony race stuff" is not racism. Assuming that every example of racial profiling or injustice is "phony race stuff" is racist. But you won't be able to see that, because you apparently are the ones unable to think with fact, since you're automatically dismissing every race-based complaint as being "phony." If you were really objective, you'd actually look into the factual basis of the allegation, would you not?Hence, you have proven my point. You really do have no clue what racism means if you think it's about "playing the race card" to manipulate a situation. Racism is about a system of beliefs and actions that center around one race being entitled to dominate and control or harm another. This includes feeling entitled to dismiss an entire race's description of their own experience as "phony."But racists are almost always unable to see that they are racists, because their defenses are too well developed.</comment>

<comment>I think the term you are looking for is "Crybullies"</comment>

<comment>Lol Says it all for progressives.</comment>

<comment>The liberal and progressive hate mongers are out in force today.  All at once now... Give me an R....Give me an A....Give me a C.....Give me an I, S, T!  What does that spell!</comment>

<comment>The last thing they've got. </comment>

<comment>Deus ex iguana</comment>

<comment>It isn't simply the future of the Republican Party at stake but the nation itself.  The GOP has allowed a rampaging demagogic maniac to get this far and now they have a responsibility to our country to stop Trump.  He must be stopped at all costs.  Trump can not be nominated and even come close to real power.</comment>

<comment>It's the people that have allowed it. Specifically the uneducated and the easily led looking for an authority figure to tell them they're going to be ok. Ironic really because those are the types that like to tell others to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.</comment>

<comment>Aided and abetted by years of demonizing the "other" by their political leaders and pundits.</comment>

<comment>The idea that building a "rainbow coalition" on the right would make Rubio popular is one of the funniest ideas I've read in a while. Racism aside, diversity and rainbows and United Colors of Beneton are not popular with Republican voters.</comment>

<comment>'Rainbow coalitions'? Was that when the WH had the rainbow lights going on the WH after the SSM ruling. Dems have a coalition going in their Anti-White rhetoric. Backlash- Trump </comment>

<comment>I love that the full staff of liberal trolls are out today. Little do they know, if $140m in big donor TV ads can't sway people away from Trump, these Trolls are certainly wasting their time. Or firing up his base! TRUMP---WINNING! </comment>

<comment>That's because Trumpets can't read.</comment>

<comment>That's you liberal trolls- very low on reading comprehension and critical thinking and high on insults and Racism.</comment>

<comment>I'll have you know I'm no liberal.And have no time for those that like to dish it out..and can't take it.</comment>

<comment>Odd you should say that when the evidence is clear (and stated in the article) that the lower a person's educational level, the more likely they'll support Trump. Says something, don't you think?</comment>

<comment>Only because the low-info liberal media and its authors are snobs. Anybody with class does not write that stuff, esp when Obama had one of the biggest majorities in poorly educated.I'm Go Trump and highly educated as so many in my top nat'l county are.Trump got the Most educated in NH, Nevada, and shared it with Rubio in SC. So the media is lying and trashing their own parties' dumb constituents. </comment>

<comment>Shhh. That ruins the narrative.</comment>

<comment>Wow, here's the person claiming to be fact based, but you have an immature emotional tirade about low-info liberal media and snobbish authors when an actual objective study shows something to be true that you don't want to believe. I can see that people like you are TOTALLY fact based!</comment>

<comment>Oooh- anger. Read my replies with a softer tone. I'm not a yeller or "emotional tirade" person. You can say someone is a snob or a low-info in a regular tone. </comment>

<comment>But it is still insulting and comes from a place of emotional reasoning. Someone is a "snob" because you judge them as a snob, not from any kind of objective observation. Whether you are using a calm or regular tone, suggesting that all allegations of racism are "phony" is emotional reasoning, as is insulting people who disagree with you without examining their premises. It's particularly ironic to accuse others of being non-factual with non-factual arguments, in my view. The fact that you or I don't like or agree with something doesn't mean it isn't true.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, the thing about "phony" racism was from someone else's post, not yours. But it is a good example.</comment>

<comment>Ok sorry </comment>

<comment>The GOP has been based on racism since 1964</comment>

<comment>The Democrats are the party of the Klan and George Wallace and LBJ.Thanks though</comment>

<comment>LBJ, who signed the Civil Rights Act, and initiated the Great Society? I think you're confused...</comment>

<comment>...and LBJ had JFK murdered because the Kennedy brothers were about to kick him off the ticket...some very ugly people in the Democrat party.</comment>

<comment>On the one hand, it's great to know which posters one can safely ignore.On the other hand, Disqus doesn't have a way to block them...</comment>

<comment>Wow, you're going deep into conspiracy theory nutland there, VOI.That being said, there are very ugly people in both parties. Trying to make it seem that the Democrats somehow have the market cornered on racism and demagoguery based on examples from 50 to 150+ years back is pretty silly, especially when we look at the GOP's blatantly racist policies and rhetoric since the Nixon administration forward to the present day.</comment>

<comment>A professor of political science at Stony Brook University has forecasted that Donald Trump has a minimum 97 percent chance of winning the general election as the Republican nominee. Norpoth’s primary model works for every presidential election since 1912, with the notable exception of the 1960 election. These results give the model an accuracy of 96.1 percent. https://www.sbstatesman.com/20... Now ask yourself why the GOPe isn't 100% supporting Trump?</comment>

<comment>Trump hasn't been vetted yet and the attack adds are on their way. When they hit the airwaves Americans will be disgusted by what they see and this charade will blow up in the faces of the Trump supporters and it will destroy the Republican party.I have the popcorn ready..... man.Knives are being sharpened.This is gonna be great!</comment>

<comment>Literally attacked every single day since June 15th.Lmao.</comment>

<comment>Tip of the iceberg</comment>

<comment>A left leaning PAC has been doing oppo research on Trump for 8 months. They say that 80% of what they've found hasn't been in the news yet. Even that probably won't deter his hard core supporters but it might be enough to prevent him getting new ones.</comment>

<comment>Trump's followers don't care about the bad stuff he did, or about his negative personal characteristics.  They want the dignified working class jobs to stop going to China, and to stop competing with hardworking Mexicans willing to work for peanuts, for the dwindling number of remaining jobs.  They could care less if the guy who promises to stop these things on a policy-level  is a jerk in his own life.Although Trump's promises are vague and likely unrealistic, there is much more substance to this approach than to one involving polls sinking because of whom a candidate slept with or was rude to.  His supporters are into issues, not distractions.</comment>

<comment>My number one issue is that a trust fund brat who never worked an honest day in his life and whose father was a notorious slum lord and racist is simply not qualified to be POTUS.</comment>

<comment>BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA</comment>

<comment>"Since 2010, nearly 300 United States residents have applied or been referred for jobs as waiters, waitresses, cooks and housekeepers there. But according to federal records, only 17 have been hired.Inall but a handful of cases, Mar-a-Lago sought to fill the jobs with hundreds of foreign guest workers from Romania and other countries."He has also sought guest workers at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach and Trump National golf club and spa in Jupiter, as well as at his vineyard in Virginia and golf clubs in New Jersey"He prefers to hire Romanian guest workers.</comment>

<comment>Again, it's what he promises to do as president for the country rather than what he did in his own business that probably counts for voters.  He can always blame the system for his actions, and promise to change that system.</comment>

<comment>The only way Trump could get the nomination was to move to the GOP.  If he has stayed in the Democratic Party, he would never have gotten by Bernie.  Sorry people, 1 Percenters belong in the GOP, and that's why they keep losing elections just like Trump will lose in 2016</comment>

<comment>1 Percenters? Like Soros?Zuckerberg? Gates?Jay Z?Bob Kraft?Oh, they're Democrats, so it doesn't matter.</comment>

<comment>Do you mean a pro-WHITE-American party?</comment>

<comment>As if there's anything wrong with being proud of being white.</comment>

<comment>If Trump were proud he would not have had hair surgery for that whatever it is on his head..</comment>

<comment>Nothing wrong with being proud of being white, nor did I suggest there is. Nothing wrong with being proud of being black, either.But there IS something wrong with adopting policies and using rhetoric which identifies whites as more important and more deserving than darker-skinned people simply because they are white.</comment>

<comment>Trumps economic plan would work and also be incredibly popular:http://www.ianwelsh.net/trumpo...</comment>

<comment>An economic analysis written by a self-described media consultant.  That's pretty hilarious, even for you.  Did you even read it?  I think you're being trollled.</comment>

<comment>Replace taxes on Americans with tariffs on the companies that sent American jobs to Mexico and China, what's not to like?You might be right about that source. Still, lots of liberals are worried Trump could win. Hillary is a terrible campaigner.</comment>

<comment>What's not to like?  Higher prices on consumer goods, for one.Americans have shown they'll willingly f*k their neighbor-owned local store if they can buy something for 10% cheaper at Walmart.  How do you think they'll react to $1200 iPhones?You're right about one thing:  Hillary is a terrible candidate/campaigner.</comment>

<comment>You realize iPhones are already stupidly expensive, correct?Moron.</comment>

<comment>You realize Trump is a liberal, correct?</comment>

<comment>You realize this isn't about Liberal vs Conservative anymore, right?</comment>

<comment>Tariffs are just taxes on American consumers. As a businessman, Trump knows full well that any business that has tariffs being employed upon them will simply pass that cost down to AMERICAN consumers via higher prices. No CEO will willing accept less profits and intend to stay in that position.</comment>

<comment>The companies paying those tariffs would either stop selling their products here and/or pass the price increase to the consumer. Thus insuring that your higher take home pay buys you less than your old one.</comment>

<comment>I'll side with Robert Reich and assert that the Republican Party in it's "establishment" incarnation is finding it's way to non-relevance.</comment>

<comment>Not only is Trump redefining the GOP he is about to bring it down as a serious party. His supporters are living in an alternate universe if they think Trump will ever become POTUS. He is a showman who is making a complete mockery of the seriousness of running for the highest office in the land. He is also making fools of his supporters. He talks down to them education wise as he did recently and they clap and cheer as if he's not talking about some of them! How dense do you have to be not to see that? Well, if you support Trump I guess that is the answer!</comment>

<comment>I'm making it a more serious party.</comment>

<comment>Predictions and forecasts abound on Trump. No one will know until the night of the election who comes out as the victor. God forbid it is Trump this country is going to be in  world of hurt plus being the laughing stock of the world.</comment>

<comment>So sorry I feel your pain.  If Trump wins you may have to get up out of bed in the morning and go to work. :-(</comment>

<comment>Is that all you have? Assuming people don't go to work or work hard. It really is pathetic you know!</comment>

<comment>The unthinkable is happening. I guess Trump's leading position is just another symptom of how much prestige politics has lost and how smart is the right wing to use people's anger in its favor.</comment>

<comment>As Trump steamrolls toward the nomination, it’s difficult to overstate how much the GOP has at stake—or how poorly positioned his rivals are to stop him.And it will stay that way until one of those candidates has the nerve to honestly assess Trump as a candidate.Until someone prominent regularly points out that Trump is marching towards fascism, Trump will continue marching that way.</comment>

<comment>But you see, they are ALL marching toward fascism and have been for years. Trump is just saying it out loud, and they can't speak against him without repudiating their own secret objectives. So they are helpless victims of their own racist/xenophobic/nationalistic rhetoric. They have created a monster and it is now attacking them!</comment>

<comment>Obama is the only guy using executive orders to get around the Constitution...so don't talk to be about Republican fascism.</comment>

<comment>Executive orders have been used by pretty much all--if not every-- president. And Obama has actually issued fewer than a lot of them. It's tabulated out here for your convenience:http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu...</comment>

<comment>You obviously haven't any idea what fascism is. It has nothing to do with choosing a particular administrative tactic to outflank and obstructionist Congress. Fascism is a conflation of power between the business community and the government, using appeals to nationalism, fear of foreigners, and authoritarian calls to suppress opposition through the suppression of civil rights, often justified by calling forth fear of the "other," whether it be a particular race or ethnic group (like "the Jews") or a particular political movement (like Communism). While I would absolutely agree that the "New Democrats" like Clinton and Obama have tended increasingly toward fascism over the last 40 years or so, the Republicans have out-fascisted them at every turn of the road.Some current examples of fascistic tactics and rhetoric:The Patriot Act: proposed and signed by GWB, a RepublicanThe War on Terror: while terrorism is a real threat, Republicans (starting with Bush) have made political capital out of making it seem far more of a threat than it really is. (Remember the "Terror Alert" system he came up with? Red, Amber, Yellow, etc.? Remember how the Terror Alert level somehow magically went up every time bad publicity happened for Bush?)ISIS and the fear of Islamic immigrants:  GOP presidential candidates are competing to say who will bomb ISIS harder and who will ban Muslims sooner and more thoroughly, even though the overwhelming majority of Muslims pose no more danger than your grandma or mine. As Obama put it, "I'm not sure why you're afraid of a bunch of women, kids and old folks," which describes most of the refugees.Deport 11 million illegal Mexican immigrants! How much would this cost again? Why is it worth this?Blacks and immigrants are milking our government for "handouts," even though the large majority of welfare is collected by white people.I could go on. And I haven't even touched the GOPs fondness for giveaways to big corporations and rich folks. The TPP would be a big favorite of fascists the world over. Notice that every Republican in Congress supports it, except those who feel their pet industry isn't getting a sweet enough deal out of it? Notice that the ONLY people opposing it in an organized way are progressive Democrats?Don't give me crap about Obama being a "fascist" because he's trying to use an end-around on Congress. Educate yourself on fascism. Believe me when I tell you, Hitler did a lot more than issue a few legal executive orders to promote his agenda!</comment>

<comment>As I've stated before now and then in other discussion threads, they have only themselves to blame.</comment>

<comment>It is almost amusing it its irony. If only I could feel completely confident that the US electorate is not stupid enough to elect him. But they voted for GWB twice, which has to give us pause...</comment>

<comment>You know, there IS something to be said for the "Establishment".I mean, sure, we can do without the trillion-dollar neocon wars, soaring debt, and the "Privatize the gains, Socialize the losses" credo of the Wall Street crooks and the politicians who service them.But "establishment" figures also sometimes have things like competence, policy knowledge, adult attention spans, and basic self-control and decorum.I *like* people who will spend their evening learning the detailed implications of the Trans-Pacific Partnership instead of obsessively sending out mean-girl Tweets to John McCain and Rosie O'Donnell.I *admire* folks who will stand up for the 200-years of honorable American military and jurisprudence tradition, rather than bark out endorsements of Gestapo and Khmer Rouge torture methods to a bloodthirsty WWE type crowd.Something here about the baby and the bathwater comes to mind.</comment>

<comment>Can we toss out the neocons and Wall Street crooks with the bathwater instead?</comment>

<comment>Of course you like trade deals which worsen America and benefit our enemies.Of course you are a pro-military shill, regardless of the mistakes they make.</comment>

<comment>Funny, you accuse me of being a neo-con hawk.  But one of your fellow Trump kindergartners just accused me of being a "far left liberal".You crazy kids.  Anything goes but except sober rationality, eh?</comment>

<comment>oh no. I didn't call you a neocon hawk. I called you the same thing he did Thanks though. </comment>

<comment>Well, turns out I'm neither.  Veteran, entrepreneur, and political moderate who reads from a wide ideological range of sources (Mother Jones on the left to American Conservative, NRO and Commentary on the right; UK, French and Singapore newspapers as well).   Just a sane person who recognizes a barking clown-demagogue when I see one.Grew up in the NYC area, so -- unlike most Americans -- have had a front-row seat to the bellowing rage-clown's constant self-promotion, boasting, messy affairs and divorces, multiple bankruptcies, and frequent public ego-tantrums for 30 years now.</comment>

<comment>Moderate? Stopped reading there. In other words you're a pussy. </comment>

<comment>Sure, the retired Marine Capt. who served in Iraq is a "pussy", and your prep-schooled, draft-dodging comb-over buy is a patriotic hero.    Wow, did that con man see you coming.And you're clearly a middle-school kid.   Not a terribly bright or mature one.Thanks for making clear that I shouldn't waste any more time with you.</comment>

<comment>You're my favourite welfare queen. </comment>

<comment>Er...Obama, the pride of the establishment and the MSM has run up a TWENTY ONE TRILLION DOLLAR debt. Think there's something to be said for that?</comment>

<comment>Drudge has a link.  Sorry if mine did not work.</comment>

<comment>No, it works, but is a link to a description of the result, not the actual model showing how primary votes were used...his published model just uses previous election results.This model only uses the general election share of the vote.http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappbl...If one accepts the result, then any Republican can be expected to win--it predicts party victory not candidate victory.One immediate problem is that it failed during the 1932-48 period -- eg during a party realignment episode and during the Reagan dealignment 1980-1992.</comment>

<comment>True, but when data is added from the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries it narrows down the forecast to specific candidates.  Trump beats Hillary 54.7 percent to 45.3 percent of the popular vote.   A hypothetical presidential race with Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio on the Republican ticket would be a much closer race. The results showed Clinton with a 55 percent chance of winning the race against Cruz or Rubio with a 0.3 percent lead in the popular vote.</comment>

<comment>Where did you get that? Post a link. The published model has only presidential votes nothing about candidates or primaries.</comment>

<comment>I like how the author identifies Trump's free trade skepticism as some sort of extreme right-wing thing.  The American Right has been a huge proponent of free trade agreements.  Bill Clinton passed NAFTA, but most of the work was done by the first Bush Administration.  The Democrats have been historically more hostile to free trade than the Republicans due to the influence of unions.Trump seems to be interested in revisiting this issue which the elites of both parties agree on while significant portion of both parties bases either don't agree or are open to scaling back America's commitment to free trade.Trump has a lot of problems and has definitely dabbled in xenophobia, but casting free trade skepticism as some sort of cryptic racist fear of foreign influence is incredibly unfair.  Millions of Americans have been left behind by the bipartisan elite commitment to free trade.  These are people who have literally seen their best bet at a middle class life get yanked from underneath their feet and over the last 25 or so years much of the remaining manual work is going to illegal immigrants.  Don't tell me these are jobs Americans won't do.  That is complete BS.  Americans just won't do those jobs at under market wages with no benefits.Call Trump all the names you want.  He's earned them.  But dismissing as racist the concerns of millions of Americans who want nothing more than a fair wage working in a mill or something along those lines is a bit much.  There's nothing inherently "European" about these politics either.  Massive free trade pacts are not the historic norm and there is nothing inherently nativist about a country renegotiating the terms of such treaties or abrogating them altogether.</comment>

<comment>“I never expected 'Idiocracy' to become a documentary,” said Etan Cohen, who co-wrote the film, on Twitter Wednesday.</comment>

<comment>Trump isn't redefining the GOP, because the presidency is only one office.  The GOP core brand still seems to be effective at the state and district level, though some radical failures like the supply side experiment in Kansas certainly have undermined them.  Gun control and local abortion laws are still potent enough as a social wedge to keep them holding a lot of governorships and House seats.However, he is exposing how fractured the GOP brand is when it comes to electing a single unifying leader, because there really isn't a unifying theme that works well for the entire party.  His positions on every economic and security issue are virtually opposite the accepted "conservative" dogma.  It turns out that GOP voters actually seem to hate the GOP's economic policies, and will vote against them, as long as the person they're voting for isn't a hated Democrat.</comment>

<comment>"He would steer the party toward a confrontational European-style racial nationalism revolving around hostility to foreign influences (from Mexican immigrants to Chinese manufacturers) and domestic elites"Oh fer cryin' out loud. This is hysterical fear-mongering. Trump's talk of a wall aside, a Republican candidate could push for, word for word, the immigration policies of say Canada, or New Zealand — enlightened bastions of democratic socialism both — and be pilloried for his her racism. Those nations are far more restrictive, but get a pass from American liberals because they have universal healthcare, or whatever else progressives here say they want that those countries have. And why are they so restrictive? Because they're smart enough to know you can't just hand out a comprehensive welfare state to anyone who crosses the border because you'll go broke. America, like any nation, is entitled to make a distinction between citizen and non-citizen and then set, and enforce, some ground rules on who gets to join our club and how. Doing so is not tantamount to fascism.</comment>

<comment>The barking ego-clown has correctly diagnosed -- LOUDLY and with great childish vulgarity -- a number of problems with the current political establishment.And, as a talented grifter, he's exploited those weaknesses to win (so far) an election in this political culture that now more closely resembles a WWE event or a particularly bad Jerry Springer episode than a nation of rational citizens.However, as Matt Taibbi puts it...."The problem, of course, is that Trump is crazy. He's like every other corporate tyrant in that his solution to most things follows the logic of Stalin: no person, no problem. You're fired! Except as president he'd have other people-removing options, all of which he likes: torture, mass deportations, the banning of 23 percent of the Earth's population from entering the United States, etc."https://www.rollingstone.com/p...</comment>

<comment>"He would steer the party toward a confrontational European-style racial nationalism..."um, doesn't that sounds much like the party currently in power? it seems fair to say there's more racial strife under obama than at any point since the last major peak in the sixties.</comment>

<comment>Trump deserves to win because he got the most votes.</comment>

<comment>The Republican establishment could have and can still forestall this with sane good government immigration proposals, and more skepticism on free trade agreements.Instead their proposal in the 2013 bill was to radically increase immigration rates yet again., as well as triple H1-B's, provide amnesty without guaranteed security, then they also failed to adequately reform the out of control Family Unification Act, or deal with fraud in several other programs.Its their own fault, but non radical changes can still save them.</comment>

<comment>"Trump Is Redefining the Republican Party"Trump and Cruz are simply revealing the true nature of what the GOP is, and has been, since Saint Reagan started it down this path.Now the Republican "establishment" which has fed at that trough is complaining because they can't control it anymore.They got what they wished for.</comment>

<comment>"Redefining"? You mean wresting control from the Bush-Clinton crime family. Throwing off the false scripted narratives that used to paper over real issues, and line the pockets for the profiteering multi-millionaire politics-for-life class.More like, if Trump doesn't win, this is the last year the Republican party can even pretend to be a relevant party for anyone, anymore.TRUMP is Reappropriating, Reintegrating, and Rejuvenating!</comment>

<comment>Trump represents the end of free trade neo liberalism that has enriched investment bankers and corporations while destroying the working and middle class. Both Democrats and Bush Republicans are just corporate and Wall Street pawns</comment>

<comment>The Trump Train has left the station and it won't stop until it gets to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue after making a victory lap of America. Donald Trump is the only candidate in either party who is not owned by the special interests of the left and of the right. He represents America's silent majority of decent men and women. </comment>
