<comment>Republicans will have to eventually broaden their support among nonWhites. What will it be? Reparations for Blacks or unlimited immigration for Latinos. If I had to guess, I'd say a high-skilled immigration program for Asian votes.</comment>

<comment>Wow. Your attempt at pandering is pretty insulting and the exact kind of reason minorities hate Republicans. Republicans don't respect Blacks & Hispanics and think of them as problems to be solved, not constituents to be served.Hint: Asians don't want to be favored in immigration. They'd rather have fair entrance opportunities into Ivy league schools.</comment>

<comment>There are fair entrance opportunities for them.</comment>

<comment>Hillary's support among African Americans is bizarre since the welfare and criminal justice reforms hurt the black community. Bernie just needs to get that message out to them.It will be harder for Bernie to get Hispanics since Clinton can point to her husband's passing of NAFTA as proof of her goodwill towards them. Even though NAFTA initially hurt many Hispanics, it did eventually produce opportunities in the US and Mexico especially for people with cross border ties.</comment>

<comment>Many Latinos are acutely aware of the abject failure and danger of populist leftist politicians, as evidenced throughout South America. Sanders anti-trade, protectionist policies will also set off alarm bells.</comment>

<comment>By that logic every Hispanic would probably have the political leanings of an older Cuban voter. </comment>

<comment>It's not bizarre at allIdeological socialism has always been the realm of young white malesNon-Asian minorities always want something more.. simple</comment>

<comment>NAFTA wasn't "goodwill." NAFTA is the reason millions of them were economically displaced and had to flee north in search of work. NAFTA helps the 1%.</comment>

<comment>in what universe was NAFTA considered "goodwill"? in the same way that what happened what happened with Flint's water could be considered nothing more than "fiscally sound measure"? GTFOH, man. NAFTA was nothing more than a shameless money grab where the US disenfranchised an entire continent using a trade agreement because formal colonialism was no longer socially acceptable. entire small villages were destroyed, small to moderate sized farming operations were no longer able to compete with corporate foreign owned Big Ag operations, and many of the only viable options for employment became black market endeavors. Anybody defending NAFTA needs to read a damned book.</comment>

<comment>One of the biggest backers of NAFTA was the Koch bros.So, on one side you've got the Koch bros and the desire of some Latinos to obscure the border.On the other side, you've got all the Americans who were harmed by NAFTA and similar agreements.Who do you suggest we throw overboard?</comment>

<comment>Why do Democrats and their Superpac MSM pals LOVE to divide Americans into groups and label everyone? No need to answer... It's a rhetorical question...For America to succeed, we need to return to the melting-pot, where all LEGAL immigrants are welcome and encouraged to participate in American ideals. Instead of celebrating our differences, we should be celebrating our common values.</comment>

<comment>"Just 42 percent of the stateâ€™s Latino residents are eligible to vote... " Nevada has the highest per capita illegal immigrant population in the U.S. - 10% of the workforce is illegal immigrant. A big reason why many workers are earning hourly wages that are lower than they were in the 1980s. The Vegas fat cats have used illegals to break unions and keep the working class beat down. Sanders should be against amnesty for illegal immigrants if he is a true "working class hero."</comment>

<comment>Illegal immigrants are working class.You get that right?</comment>

<comment>Not to worry, lots of non-citizens will vote too. Who is going to enforce the law? Democratic caucus workers? Surely you jest.</comment>

<comment>If Latino's young or old are smart they will vote for the party who have their best interests at heart and are not prepared to split up families or call them murderer's or rapists. That has been the trade mark of Trump and others so if any Latino votes Republican sadly they get what they deserve. Immigration reform is long overdue and something needs to be done. It is not amnesty what Obama or other Dems are promoting either. It's the same thing some of the GOP candidates are talking about albeit just a few of them. Of course it's only amnesty when it comes from the lips of a Democrat.</comment>

<comment>"Will that pattern play out again this year, too?" No, just as it has not elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>Global Warming policies have denied western nations trillions of dollars in opportunity. As the western societies no longer have growth, socialism is sold to them as a solution.</comment>
