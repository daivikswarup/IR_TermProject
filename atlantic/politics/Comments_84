<comment>The man was 79 and his heart gave out. It was on the verge of that for years. You don't need an autopsy every time somebody dies of old age, even if they are a Supreme Court Justice. I really don't get the hand-wringing. </comment>

<comment>"I really don't get the hand-wringing."Something something Obammunism</comment>

<comment>so say the legion of tin foil hat people like you</comment>

<comment>Right over your head.</comment>

<comment>in your wet dreams</comment>

<comment>you need to be reminded that only tthe right wing regards themselves so much in lockstep that tthey gave themselves a nickname to celebrate it.Right,  Dittohead?So you need to carry that baggage around when referring to tiffoil hats. Also Clarence Thomas was in lockstep with Scalia,so you corpettes are fine with lockstep to the tune of your failed ideology, and yes, pissing on the poor is failed ideology</comment>

<comment>what kind of moron are you...dipstick????Red through and through CONAZI</comment>

<comment>aww, dittohead still strikes a nerve, I see. I'm a Liberal. Historically we've always been right and regressives such as yourself have always been wrong. This would be either before your time or during your post rational period.And clarence thomas is a poster child for being in lockstep with scqlia, so you can't be against lockstep. Probably you sense that greed as an ideology is a loser and has been for forty years.</comment>

<comment>you come across as a trumpette butt wipe..</comment>

<comment>I'd wipe my butt on any of you corpettes but only after I take a dump on trump.then there's that clarence thomas in lockstep with scalia thing you're trying to ignore. Sorry, chumpingtton, it's still in your face.So you're ok with mindless lockstep from Thomas since you try to deflect and fail. Thomas' locksttep with scalia is still in your face</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your input....Librul troll</comment>

<comment>Broadcast the autopsy live on CSPAN.  "Here are the lungs damaged by smoking.  Check.  Here is the pancreas decayed by alcoholism.  Check.

<comment>Black President with a non-Anglo name. No different than the past 7 yrs.</comment>

<comment>You referring to the genotype or the phenotype?</comment>

<comment>People are very stupid. </comment>

<comment>These people have the best doctors in the world. Cheney is still alive. Barbara Bush just went traipsing through the snow in her 90s when most people wouldn't go outside in a summer storm for fear of pneumonia. Hillary is on a host of medications for her blood clots and is monitored daily. Scalia had just seen his physician who clearly thought he was well enough for a trip. You are correct that his age and physical condition are not red flags, but also there are questions about why he wasn't autopsied and was embalmed within 24 hours (yes i know embalming is required in Texas but it still happened very fast and would make a tox screen impossible).</comment>

<comment>You don't read articles very well do you?</comment>

<comment>Yes I know he had health problems but my position is that he was not expected to die from them.</comment>

<comment>Right, because doctors have the ability to know precisely when elderly cardiac patients are going to kick it.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. Har har har that's exactly what I said.</comment>

<comment>I didn't favor most of Scalia's comments and end decisions in court cases, but I did and do respect him.  I also thought an autopsy was going to be performed, as is only fair. The family in the end decided not to - the initiative pretty much ends when the family said no. If I were a family member, I would've said yes. Maybe Scalia knew it was his time. I don't believe in that stuff, but sometimes some people know and are ready to let go.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the polite comment. I have read many articles across mainstream media about Scalia's death and it simply seemed very rushed to pronounce him dead of natural causes outside a hospital, no autopsy, and embalming within 24 hours. Now the President is making a statement by refusing to attend the funeral.</comment>

<comment>I agree. I have also read various media sources since this will affect the immigration case that I am extensively following. In all truths, I really do believe it was a natural cause. As for the President, he does have the freedom of choice. If I were President, I probably wouldn't go either. There may be people there that might not find him welcoming and see it as boasting.</comment>

<comment>Well the last time a Justice died in office he was eulogized by the President. It's unusual and looks like a snub. The office of President has certain duties and standards of behavior but perhaps you are right that it is better this way.</comment>

<comment>Eh. If he went then all the focus would be on him, and his reactions, because of the political tension over this. One single out of context photo of him cracking a grin and the Right would go crazy (well, crazier). He's doing the right thing. Just because GWB eulogized Rehnquist doesn't make it a tradition. I doubt Obama's even been asked to give a eulogy.On top of that, he's been going out of his way to praise Scalia and he's paying his respects in person on Friday. The only people who see this as a snub are people who hate everything he does.</comment>

<comment>I thought it would be protocol to attend but I see your point.</comment>

<comment>Obama is not going because he knows the truth.</comment>

<comment>Maybe, Scalia's family didn't want him there.  Hmmm?</comment>

<comment>Yet that same president who delivered that eulogy (W) skipped Justice Byron White's funeral in 2002.  FYI, non-presidential funeral attendance customarily falls on the Office of the Vice President.  The family seems to be just fine with the proposed attendance by the POTUS at the Supreme Court and VP at the celebration of the mass.  I fail to see why certain partisans feel so pressed to dishonor Justice Scalia's memory by repeatedly disregarding the grieving family's autopsy and funeral attendance decisions at every turn.</comment>

<comment>VP is RC as was Scalia much more appropriate for him to go than the Protestant Obams. As you say it's often the VP job .presidential movements just cause chaos with all the security.</comment>

<comment>Obama is a petty morsel always acting bratty and flippy which he does a lot since the nation heartily dislikes him and his actions and he can't cope with it - so why wouldn't he be a complete freak by not paying homage to a Supreme Court Justice who will go down in history alongside he Greats when Obama is already in league with the losers.</comment>

<comment>Did you lose your way to breitbart.com perchance?</comment>

<comment>It would be pure hypocrisy for Obama to praise Scalia, who was a racist fascist to the core.</comment>

<comment>If there is a split in the 8-person court, the existing order will stand and no precedent will be set for the nation.  The injunction for immigration will stand, but only for Texas.    If another case arose, it would be decided on it's merits.</comment>

<comment>Yes, thank you Lucifer666. I did read a reliable article from POLITICO about how this will affect all the pending cases. Either way, all the cases will be heard after the new justice has been approved and appointed.  My opinion:  The Court promised to take on the immigration case ASAP after Obama Administration's plea.  With or without Justice Scalia, the Court's word (promise) is very important and part of their integrity as the supreme law over the nation.</comment>

<comment>POLITICO?That's like the WSJ agenda polling.</comment>

<comment>Yes, you are correct and I am aware. Comparing to other articles at the time, it was the most descriptive and well written article. Also, POLITICO has spoken against Wisconsin Republican Governor Walker and his cronies (POLITICO mentioned all of them as cronies). I live in Wisconsin, and unfortunately it sucks. I am part of the grass root movements against the radical conservative leaders here and POLITICO did a great story on Wisconsin politics when no other media sources do, not even MSNBC. I am not a POLITICO fanboy, but I do keep an open-mind.</comment>

<comment>POLITICO has made some dreadful mistakes so I proceed with caution.Would like to see their overview on the new "agenda" type of polling.</comment>

<comment>And that's why I read across the board.</comment>

<comment>Why would anyone think that the SCOTUS would elect to proceed without the extra vote?Although nine is too many anyway and 3 would suffice, or even 5 if someone hollered enough.</comment>

<comment>Why would anyone be following the immigration case?If something is illegal no one should want it.It's America's fault that she doesn't have the fortitude to do as Australia does in getting rid of their illegals.</comment>

<comment>Whether you approve or disapprove, many are following the case. It would be unwise not to follow the case on either side of the aisle.  For example, let's say Republicans don't follow up and do not submit their appeals, immigration would not become as restrictive.</comment>

<comment>Those following the case are here illegally.</comment>

<comment>I don't care what your stance is on immigration. The subject at hand is the debate of "why would anyone follow the immigration" case? All of Congress, Executive, and Supreme Court are involved and following up on the case. With your logic, anyone who follows the case is illegal - meaning every US politician and judge is illegal.</comment>

<comment>The immigration laws worked for everyone and then Teddy Kennedy came up with an elixir to gain more Democrat Party votes than any other political party and Immigration Reform occurred.Illegals are coming in because of USA Welfare, not for the flimsy excuses of 'work.'Illegal immigration has destroyed the country because it has made the country a Welfare State..There are a lot of angry Latinos who are here legally and want the illegals to go back and do it right.Perhaps there are enough of those, as well as the legals from the other 190 countries' illegals that're here to make a difference by voting for a GOP who will make legal immigration for America the norm again.</comment>

<comment>This topic is highly debatable since it contains complex factors, content, and history. I will defer it to the politicians.</comment>

<comment>No, it is not debatable because immigration laws worked and now they don't work because of Ted Kennedy/Democrat Party Reform of Immigration Laws For Votes.</comment>

<comment>Immigration laws have always been behind even before Ted Kennedy/Democrat Party Reform. A good example are the Chinese Immigration Court cases from 1883-1924.  One court case had to go all the way to the Supreme Court during that time simply for the US Chinese citizen to prove he was a US Citizen. That's a sign that the laws didn't work equally for everyone.</comment>

<comment>No.Immigration worked and citing a few cases that needed clarification doesn't mean it didn't.What isn't working now is illegals and the businesses that hire them and that's got to go as well as Rubio's H1B foreign worker bill because there are over a hundfred million Americans out of work and foreigner workers are the same as illegal.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately these were the cases that were heard. The ones that weren't, were never brought up to the courts excluding the Chinese. There have always been immigration issues. If immigration worked, there wouldn't been a need whatsoever for courts. If you say something is not broken, then there shouldn't be any issues to begin with in the first place.</comment>

<comment>what statement is the Kenyan making?...he's going to the wake...is he making a statement there?....what's a statement, btw?</comment>

<comment>birfer alert!!</comment>

<comment>that's probably why the Kenyan killed Scalia..Trump's guys finally got the info they needed in Hawaii....Trump gets it to Scalia, Scalia about to show America the truth about the Kenyan, so the Kenyan takes a trip to a conference out west, makes a pit stop in Texas, and offs the conservative behemoth....why aren't more people seeing this?</comment>

<comment>that would be much more impressive if you sang it and accompanied yourself on swinette.</comment>

<comment>We see that 'Kenyan' moving according to all the politics that've told him what to do from the backlash those politicos got from their own constituencies.Obama is a very mean man and thought he could kick Scalia in the head for opposing progress on his Clean Air Act.He views Scalia as his personal nemesis and stopping his 'legacy' when if Obama were not an egomaniac he would understand that he has no legacy....all that he claims are his legacy have been miserably denounced as wicked by WE People not just any GOP in Congress.Apparently he is begrudgingly attending the wake after he monstrously proudly announced he would not attend the funeral.He is such bad taste with his petulant behavior, no way ever been a diplomat, just an embarrassment to the White House with the whole nation and world looking on and he has no shame.</comment>

<comment>but why did he have to kill Scalia?</comment>

<comment>because he fed himself (copiously) with his LEFT hand.So does obama, but  it is written 'thou shalt cut thy executive officer some black slack but not an appointed official with postmaturely brown hair.  Of course being that fat meant fewer wrinkles...</comment>

<comment>He was  under a doctor's care for a severe heart condition.  I'm guessing that it was congestive heart failure.  He was obese.  It is standard practice to embalm dead people right away, unless there's a reason not to.  Decomp isn't kind. In what world is there a conspiracy?</comment>

<comment>No one here is conspiring. It's just that no autopsy gives the tin foil hats that come out of the woodwork on these occasions more to work with.</comment>

<comment>died with pillow over his face... no cause for alarm, just another natural death.... right?</comment>

<comment>Maybe.....if there was a pillow.What was missing was curiosity since the place was a sportsman's delight and no one would go there to sleep their time away.Yet no one bothered to inquire after Scalia after hours had passed since he missed breakfast and it was almost time for lunch, which he ended up missing too.It's no wonder that conspiracy is floating around speculating whether Obama was that afraid of his nemesis.Kinda like the Vince Foster episode.</comment>

<comment>You have to understand Obama's position. As a half black man, according to Scalia, he probably would not understand most of what will be said at the memorial anyway! You know, all of us darkies have a hard time comprehending white folks and their rituals!</comment>

<comment>What a bad!</comment>

<comment>Irony at its worst...</comment>

<comment>It is standard practice to not do an autopsy if there is a known condition that likely caused the death.  Unless something was amiss in Scalia's death, this is how it works for everyone.</comment>

<comment>There are different rules for different jurisdictions. Being under a physician's care recently is usually sufficient reason to forgo a post mortem.</comment>

<comment>Duh retards an autopsy is the only evidence of a heart attack or condition. How you just going look at someone and declare he had this or that without any clinical evidence.</comment>

<comment>Autopsies as a matter of fairness?! Please, world, treat me unfairly at the time of my death.</comment>

<comment>I apologize if there was misunderstanding and I should have been more specific. I am not here to defend anyone. If the family was asked and had agreed to an autopsy, it is only fair it be done. I am not implying every unfortunate soul should have an autopsy.</comment>

<comment>Maybe different in Texas or whoever's jurisdiction this falls under, but the cops can decide to perform an autopsy against the family's wishes if they have credible reason to suspect foul play.  They can, and have, performed autopsies against the family's wishes many times.On the other hand, people need to quit watching so much TV.  Autopsies are the exception, not the rule.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I am aware society can impose an autopsy without the consent of family, but that is not the case in this situation. Thank you very much for your response - no sarcasm.</comment>

<comment>No, you did not.</comment>

<comment>pillow over his face when found... no cause for alarm... go back to sleep skippy.</comment>

<comment>The pillow wasn't over his face. It was propped on the bed behind his head.</comment>

<comment>Pointdexter (who found the body) said that it was over his face.</comment>

<comment>You'd be surprised that they can.it is rather odd that Scalia was excited about being where he liked to be, the environment and the sport, but when he didn't show up for breakfast and for hours afterward near to lunch time that no one went to see or even called to see if he was ok.Kick that one around.</comment>

<comment>Clearly, then, all of the other guests and the host and host's family were in on it.  Clever of you to figure that out.</comment>

<comment>And coroners to determine through an autopsy if that's what killed him.  Thanks for making that point.</comment>

<comment>The average age expectancy for men is 78. Scalia lived that long. His death wasn't premature. He was sick.</comment>

<comment>Really?  He had a heart condition that precluded him from having surgery. That means there was a high risk that he would have died from either the anesthesia or trauma of the surgery.  You know nothing.</comment>

<comment>What?  Heart disease, hypertension, obesity, devoted tobacco smoker, advanced age, rejected surgical candidate.  Just how many more decades do you think he had in front of him?</comment>

<comment>gee when you are too weak for elective surgery...that says something...ya think?</comment>

<comment>You're a walking time bomb for a heart attack if you are 79 years old, overweight, with heart problem and have high blood pressure and a smoker for over 50 years.. Medicines to help Scalia with some of his conditions won't allow him to live forever. It was because of his conditions that his own doctor wouldn't allow badly needed shoulder surgery because he was too weak for it.</comment>

<comment>you are the pot calling the kettle black Kilia. what is there about a public figure dying with a pillow over his face and not having a physician determine cause of death (raising questions of foul play) NOT bother you!? are you that easily led that you drop all common sense to accept what you are told without question? no, it is you who have not read the article well. please go back an re-read.</comment>

<comment>Wow, so dumb I don't know where to start.  So I won't.....</comment>

<comment>Wow! Thanks! Thanks for holding back the flood of your great intellect it may have drowned us all!</comment>

<comment>We can't pick our time of death. His number was up.</comment>

<comment>Hey, 79 is 79. No doctor can cure old age.</comment>

<comment>Wow you are so on point Sir. These people a crazy rich and can lives for years but yet this guy can't. Its said they treated Scalia like a bum on the street, smdh, We are in a world of trouble my fellow Americans.</comment>

<comment>it could be said the impression of the questioning for the death certificate was done over the phone was hasty and the entire business becomes spurious.Especially the death coming on the heels of Scalia slapping Obama hard against a wall by voting, of course,to toss Obama's clean air stuff back to the lower court!</comment>

<comment>therefore.......?</comment>

<comment>If this was about a Russian judge who was blocking Putin's power grabs suddenly dying would it be suspicious then?</comment>

<comment>Well you are right and why assault his remains especially if the family was against it. They should have taken a few precautions though like taking blood and tissue samples and for all I know maybe this was done. Conspiracy theorists are going to conspire.</comment>

<comment>All well and good then why have a death certified over the phone?Not exactly protocol and a dismal rebuke to Scalia since he was a human being by the lazy one doing it.</comment>

<comment>The family didn't think there was foul play, the police didn't think there was foul play, the doctors didn't think there was foul play, the US Marshals didn't think there was foul play. Doing it over the phone is just much more efficient in a state like Texas where everything is ridiculously far from everything else, and this is standard protocol in Texas. Old people dying of natural causes is not exactly rare. Scalia has been on the verge of heart failure for years, and it finally happened. There was nothing suspicious about this at all, this is just normal old mortality at work.Nobody gets out of this world alive, even Supreme Court Justices. Sometimes people die at inconvenient times all on their own accord.</comment>

<comment>By your logic Bernie Sanders shouldn't be running for president... he is 75 years old and according to you about to kick the bucket!</comment>

<comment>I do think he's too old to be President. Life expectancy for men in the US is 78.7, few people are functioning at the peak of their abilities at that age, and it's not at all uncommon for people's heath to rapidly and suddenly degrade when you're up there in years. Wilson had a stroke and couldn't function. Reagan had mental degeneration. William Henry Harrison just flat out died. Late 60s is pushing it for a President as is, mid 70s is way too old. Of course, there's always individual variance, and you can't predict, but actuarially, Sanders is far more likely to have significant health issues than any other candidate, and when an entire branch of Government is vested in one person, the condition of their physical body does come into play on occasion.</comment>

<comment>So now, we will forever have to hear from the tinfoil hatted that Obama killed Scalia or some other nonsense.  I know it's Texas and all, but come on.</comment>

<comment>it's weird though...likely, Obama did kill him, but I would have expected a golf club to the head, not pillow strangulation...the Kenyan always surprises</comment>

<comment>I'm going with the candlestick in the library....</comment>

<comment>never trusted that mustard fellow...</comment>

<comment>The "Obama sumptin', sumptin'" crowd will always be with us. Regardless of what happened.</comment>

<comment>These nutjobs follow people like Michael Wiener, who changed his name to Michael Savage.  Weird-o.</comment>

<comment>You saw the sit down interview the Donald did with him yesterday? To go with his birther and truther  theories he sounded ready to buy into... Scalia? We got a name for this one yet?I need to disable this useless autocorrect!</comment>

<comment>We would have heard that anyway 6 autopsies wouldn't have been enough to stop them.and you know Obama was right there in California meeting with a bunch of furriiners Probably supplied him with sneaky undetectable Asian poison....I really shouldn't encourage them.</comment>

<comment>I don't understand why the first 2 judges they called were "too far away" but the 3rd, closest, judge just did everything by phone anyway. That does not add up. Were they looking for a judge who would sign off remotely rather than seeing the body?</comment>

<comment>Because it's allowed by Texas law AND Scalia's identity was not released to the judge.  In other words, he was just another John Doe--most likely an illegal immigrant.  Happens every day in Texas.</comment>

<comment>Didn't the judge say that she had consulted with Scalia's personal physician?  And if the location of death were known, I doubt that would lend itself to the idea that it was a "John Doe" immigrant. Just wondering.</comment>

<comment>Consulted with his doctor to complete the report after pronouncing him dead from the ER techs on the scene. No there here.</comment>

<comment>Yes that's it. A conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>definitely....my uncle had a guy killed years ago, as part of his mob initiation...problem was, he got the wrong guy, so he called a local judge, bribed him with a C note, they called it pneumonia, and everybody was cool with it...the dead guy's family hated him anyway..kind of like the Cruz'</comment>

<comment>Even if there had been an autopsy, the conspiracy nut jobs would just say the coroner was in on it. There's no winning with these people. </comment>

<comment>Luckily, there's also no winning FOR those people.</comment>

<comment>For the 'whatever' type of people.</comment>

<comment>Regardless, it's always best to avoid the appearance of impropriety.That means performing an autopsy on one of the most powerful people in the world if he/she dies outside of a hospital setting.</comment>

<comment>That's idiotic. The vast majority of people who die don't get autopsies, even "important" people. He was an obsese elderly man with high blood pressure. You people have lost your minds. </comment>

<comment>He had a heart condition that precluded him from having surgery.  I'm going to speculate that it was congestive heart failure.  Pneumonia would have likely set in after the surgery, and he would have died from the pneumonia.  That scenario is very common.  I think Glenn Frey died from a primary pneumonia.</comment>

<comment>Reportedly, autopsies are now incredibly rare. </comment>

<comment>This made a lot more sense the other time you wrote it.</comment>

<comment>If you read the article, it said that the family did not want an autopsy.Their wishes come first.</comment>

<comment>Not in a criminal investigation.  You are a tool.</comment>

<comment>is there a Scalia death criminal investigation?</comment>

<comment>family or kin don't appear mentioned in Sec. 6 (a), medical examiner (or authorized deputy) duties.</comment>

<comment>Autopsies can be very embarrassing for legacies and survivors. </comment>

<comment>No way.  This is standard practice.  It's not appropriate to waste public resources when you know the decedent had a preexisting health condition that was severe enough to cause death.</comment>

<comment>We're talking a Justice of the United States here.</comment>

<comment>A Supreme Court justice. So? You're saying they should have ordered one in anticipation of conspiracy theorists doing what they'd do anyway? His family or physician could have ordered one. The local JP followed procedure. Obese man a month away from his 80th birthday and too ill for surgery dies. Not suspicious, no matter who he is. </comment>

<comment>Switch out Scalia for Bernie sanders or Hillary and you would be screaming blood murder</comment>

<comment>If either were 80, in health so lousy that minor surgery would kill then, died in their sleep and the familes didn't want an autopsy? I don't think I would. It's not about Scalia's politics.The idea of foul play seems pretty far-fetched. Especially foul play as part of some shadowy conspiracy.It's like the people who say that the fact that they didn't check for explosives in the rubble on 9/11 after two jets hit is proof that explosives were involved and it was a cover up.</comment>

<comment>There are less invasive procedures that could have and may have been. Done. These ER tech types that work in remote areas like that are pretty good diagnosticians themselves.</comment>

<comment>“Then everybody’s in on the conspiracy? The FBI and the CIA and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men’s room attendant at the White House?”“I would leave out the men’s room attendant.”</comment>

<comment>You forgot the sou-chef at Pete's Open Kitchen.</comment>

<comment>No it's just simple-minded people take everything at face value instead of looking at all the many peculiarities about this situation. Think outside of the box.   </comment>

<comment>Your not real, are you?</comment>

<comment>No I'm a figment of your vivid imagination. </comment>

<comment>There's not a single peculiarity here. You nuts are just bored and sad. </comment>

<comment>Poor simple-minds- smh. Go back to fairytale land. I grew past that quite a while back. Cya</comment>

<comment>I guess you're too busy shaking your head to point out the supposed "peculiarities"? I genuinely hope Scalia's family doesn't see all the nut bag conspiracy theories online. It's so disrespectful. </comment>

<comment>I would want an autopsy if he were my family---with him having so much power. Just so I can live without regrets and 'knowing'. </comment>

<comment>Well then, you should email Mrs. Scalia and let her know how wrong she is. Ask her what she's hiding. </comment>

<comment>No silly. It's not her that people are questioning. It's all just weird - the pillow and all.</comment>

<comment>Stop being stupid. It's embarrassing to humankind. There's not one weird thing about an old fat man with high blood pressure dying in his sleep. It's literally the least weird thing that's ever happened. Even the stupid "suspicious" pillow was a misunderstanding. It wasn't covering his face. </comment>

<comment>That's your opinion. There is apparently a lot of sharper people than you that think it's not so cut & dry, or else there would not be all these articles written about it. Cya Gullible.</comment>

<comment>This article is mocking and debunking the claims of people like you. Very very stupid people. </comment>

<comment>Liberals are the real idiots. They buy anything.</comment>

<comment>Do you watch Fox News?</comment>

<comment>Not much anymore. I certainly don't watch liberal lying news. They dupe you all and sanitize your news via PCness.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. Like reality.</comment>

<comment>The stupid is strong in this one, Luke.</comment>

<comment>Now if some other elderly VIP with known health issues decides to shuffle off this mortal coil....Let the games begin.It wouldn't actually be all that surprising actually. These things seem to often occur in batches for some reason - or no reason.</comment>

<comment>You don't know if the pillow misunderstanding was true or not. Someone could of changed the story you mad numbskulls on this site.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it's very strange that he had a pillow on his bed. I have a pillow above my head right now as I lie in bed and type this. I have not been murdered. </comment>

<comment>Ha ha cute</comment>

<comment>Are you sure....?</comment>

<comment>Thankfully that's not a decision complete strangers can routinely make for his widow and her children.  She probably wants them to view their dad's body intact, sans Y-shaped sewn-up incisions from shoulder joints down to the pubic bone, ear-to-ear across the crown of the head and reconstructed sawed-open cranium.  Autopsy images available on a search engine near you might give second thoughts on that ever-so casual decision you seem to be willing to make for your family.  I would expect my own family to honor my advanced directive refusing autopsy, and would never authorize such desecration of their corpses, but to each his own, I guess.</comment>

<comment>They could have preformed a few less invasive tests, like taking fluid from the heart.</comment>

<comment>Again. Why? Apparently the family is aware of Scalia's medical conditions (diabetes, heart disease, overweight, lifetime smoker). I'm assuming they know more than you, me, Alex Jones or Donald Trump. He was just determined to not be well enough to handle shoulder surgery. There would have been tests. </comment>

<comment>The man had a severe heart condition.  That = known cause of death.  No autopsy is standard practice, but MEs aren't in the business of satisfying the desires of conspiracy theorists.</comment>

<comment>Simple-minded people buy the Official Tale, but there are also plenty of simple-minded people on the other side who shoot themselves in the foot. Just as many liberals will say "I believe the Official Tale because Obama says it", many cons will say "I believe he was murdered because Obama says he wasn't". Neither are true skeptics willing to weigh all the evidence and get at the truth. Cons will invent wild conspiracy theories, which FactCheck/Snopes/MSM will use to discredit all those who want the truth.Trump is continuing to play to mouthbreathers and making things worse by telling his own tale about the case: stumptrump.us/n/59</comment>

<comment>The truth is out there, I want to believe, etc...</comment>

<comment>So what do you think happened Sarah?</comment>

<comment>Lizard people, I'm guessing. </comment>

<comment>With heart attack guns.</comment>

<comment>Idk but seems like a new movie will be in the works. Who will play Scalia? </comment>

<comment>He died 3000 miles away from home, at a lavish resort where he was staying with a "close friend".  I mean, I don't think we need some huge conspiracy.  Read between the lines.  I don't doubt he wasn't in the best of health but I would imagine there were some "contributing factors".</comment>

<comment>Crack?  Oxi?</comment>

<comment>The little blue pill, bud.</comment>

<comment>Oh, I get it.  Wonder how they snuck the hookers out though.</comment>

<comment>It may have just been his mimi beardsley.</comment>

<comment>You know, the more I think about it, the more I like the crack and hookers story.  It'll play better in the fly over states and DC drawing rooms.</comment>

<comment>Plus it's super fun.</comment>

<comment>He probably couldn't get it up.  No joke.</comment>

<comment>Of course he could have died naturally but there are many mysterious details. The ranch owner is a Democrat donor who received an award from Obama in person. Scalia's son was supposed to be on the trip but canceled at the last minute. The family later refused an autopsy apparently for no religious or other specific reasons. The attorney friend Scalia was with invited him to the ranch at this specific time (so it was not Scalia's idea to go). Scalia's security marshals were sent away from the ranch, reportedly at Scalia's direction. Scalia did not exert himself at the ranch as he mostly rode in the truck the day before he was found dead. He was found by the ranch owner who said his sheets were undisturbed, bedclothes unwrinkled, with a pillow over his head. Heart attack victims almost always struggle (grabbing sheets etc) and even vomit. The CIA has had a "heart attack gun" since the mid-20th century that uses a frozen bullet of untraceable poison and causes one's heart to stop https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>I've had two heart attacks - one of which while I was sleeping. I didn't struggle, grab the sheets, or vomit. I've traded war stories with many other heart attack victims since, and none of them struggled, grabbed sheets, or vomited.The CIA has a heart attack gun that uses a frozen bullet of untraceable poison? Do they have a secret healing ray that removes traces of the entrance wound?Do you think anybody takes any of that seriously?</comment>

<comment>Zombie Vince Foster does.</comment>

<comment>Did you get lost Jeff?</comment>

<comment>Nah, just bored of all the sanity.</comment>

<comment>Yes it can be fun out here for a short amount of time ;)</comment>

<comment>Thank you for offering a personal anecdote but that's all that is. I linked to an external source about the gun but no one on this site looks at links. Obviously I wasted my time commenting as I've gotten your personal life story and a "funny" death threat in response. How incredibly childish.</comment>

<comment>A death threat? If you think I've issued a death threat, funny or otherwise, by all means contact a mod and have me banned.Loon.</comment>

<comment>I was talking about the poster who wrote "Your next [sic]" to me right below this. Do you understand now? Thanks for calling me another name. This is really a lovely community you all have here.</comment>

<comment>Vomiting can occur in a heart attack if the part of the heart affected is the part next to the diaphragm.  It actually happened to my father.</comment>

<comment>Just looked it up and you're right. It occasionally happens in men, more frequently in women. Still, I must have spoken to 30 people about their heart attacks and I never heard of it. Live and learn.Of note, my first heart attack was pretty massive, but until I reached ER there was no pain or discomfort whatsoever. Just anxiety like I'd never felt before. It went way, way beyond an "anxiety attack." It was more like, "Something is wrong. Very, very wrong. I don't know what it is but I need an ambulance RIGHT NOW."  I was like that right up until the blood test, and then the eagle's claws tore into my chest and I began screaming.The second one happened while I was taking a nap. It woke me up out of a sound sleep and the pain started off slight and then built and built while I waited for the ambulance.I've since quit smoking, given up meat, started walking, and keep my fingers crossed.</comment>

<comment>Your next bro.</comment>

<comment>The CIA has his IP address now , Hes toast</comment>

<comment>IKR!</comment>

<comment>You actually believe that, don't you? Nothing you listed is even remotely suspicious or mysterious, and the "heart attack gun" is pure fiction. </comment>

<comment>The video I linked showed Congressional testimony about the gun. Refusing to look at evidence is immature.  You really think a poison dart gun is beyond Intel capabilities?</comment>

<comment>The fact that you think a video from the 70's is evidence that Scalia was murdered by a magic disappearing poison dart speaks volumes about your mental state. </comment>

<comment>Why can't you read? I said the video is evidence that the gun is real. Now that you were wrong about the gun you create a straw man argument that I claimed the gun killed him. The entire purpose of my comment was not to present a fictional account of what happened but to list reasons the general public as well as a former homicide Chief of Washington, DC are curious. The rudeness on this site is truly shocking.</comment>

<comment>You're spouting insane nonsense and you're concerned about rudeness? You need help. </comment>

<comment>They've been poisoning him with cigarettes and bacon for the last 60 years. This is deeper than anybody realizes. </comment>

<comment>I don't believe the info about the ranch owner being a democrat is correct. Anyway I don't believe there are ANY democratic ranch owners in Texas, especially ones that host big time conservatives. Doesn't compute.</comment>

<comment>I'm not making up random details. The LA Times covered that the ranch owner, John Poindexter, is a Democrat donor who also received a bespoke award from Obama. http://www.latimes.com/nation/...</comment>

<comment>Oh, for God's sake. Here's the description of the man from that article, including why he got that award from Obama:Does that sound like a likely Democratic assassination conspirator to you?</comment>

<comment>It's the perfect cover! He and his unit were planted in Vietnam just so they'd be ready when needed. </comment>

<comment>You know what else makes a person's heart stop? Being an old fat man with high blood pressure and heart disease.</comment>

<comment>I totally GET what you are saying. But you do not know what happened so you shouldn't pretend it's a settled issue. Plenty of people like Cheney have heart disease and suffer multiple attacks but are kept alive by the best doctors. It's not like Scalia died in a hospital after a heart attack and I'm saying a freaking Stasi agent in a nurse costume snuck past the guards and killed him. Take a look at the actual info. The guy had enemies. None of us should be 100% certain of anything we don't know firsthand. Enjoy your time on this site. I will never come back here.</comment>

<comment>Barstool?  Isn't that the abstinent Palin girl who keeps turning up pregnant?  Yes...Barstool Palin.</comment>

<comment>It is, indeed, a settled issue.  A death certificate will be issued to confirm that.</comment>

<comment>Scalia.  Had.  An.  Existing.  Heart.  Condition.  One that was severe enough to preclude him from having shoulder surgery.</comment>

<comment>None of this is particularly mysterious. And the pillow was reportedly above his head, not covering it. </comment>

<comment>How about he had a severe existing heart condition -- my guess it's congestive heart failure, which has, generally, a projected survival rate of no more than 5 years after diagnosis.</comment>

<comment>He'd just returned from Hong Kong. Long flights like that are tiring and increase the risks of DVT and /or PE especially in  someone his age with cardiac disease. Leave the man and his family in peace.</comment>

<comment>It sounds like he was seriously ill for a while and they don't want that revealed to me.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  Sandra Day O'Conner resigned, not knowing how ill Chief Justice Rehnquist actually WAS.</comment>

<comment>He had just come back from Hong Kong a few weeks before.  Why was he traveling so much if his doctor thought he was so ill?</comment>

<comment>He had a heart condition that was severe enough to preclude him from shoulder surgery.</comment>

<comment>Amazing...if you want to get rid of someone... pick someone with a preexisting medical condition. Ensure no autopsy and then cremate them quickly.</comment>

<comment>It's his family that's insisting on no autopsy which suggests to me anyway that maybe he was serving on the bench with a serious heart condition.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>Autopsies are extremely rare these days. And he hasn't been cremated, has he? The family doesn't want an autopsy - are they in on it?It sounds like they were very aware of his medical status. </comment>

<comment>No one gets away with busting heads with the Clintons or Obammy.</comment>

<comment>Sooner or later they will kill every republican in america, because no one gets way with it.</comment>

<comment>I am sure they dream of that every night.</comment>

<comment>They've (the illuminati) been secretly doing it for years by subsidizing big tobacco, the processed meat industry, the auto industry and the NFL (making people smoke, getting them fat and. keeping them stuck in their cars and on their couches instead of, you know, walking). </comment>

<comment>Who wants to know???</comment>

<comment>What's not clear? Rothschilds gave the order, and Zionists sent by Mossad and AIPAC executed him. Must be obvious to every preschooler.</comment>

<comment>This is much lower on the chain of command.He disrespected his posse, noting that they were all from Yale and Harvard and we're all Roman. Catholics  and Jews. He said they need to be more diverse.Hardly a matter for big fish like your masters.Nice try, but your aim is never true since you gave up on being a Jew.</comment>

<comment>IF he had followed Michelle Obama's advice on diet and exercise he would still be alive.</comment>

<comment>She has a plan to live forever? Interesting.</comment>

<comment>Where did I say anything about living forever?</comment>

<comment>Yes, he only lived a few years longer than the average American male.</comment>

<comment>VERY glad he didnt. Obviously, as a Faux News follower, he had followed Roger Ailes' advice on diet and exercise.</comment>

<comment>A sinister plan -- she was using reverse psychology to make him eat horribly and be sedentary, apparently. </comment>

<comment>So, the gist of the article is "Hey, no one broke Texas law!" That won't cut it. The question was never about legality, but whether an autopsy should have been persued. If only to quell the conspiecy theories from destroying the credibility of the courts next many decisions by asserting that they are all the consequence of a hit job. That end itself is important enough to have ordered an autopsy.</comment>

<comment>Slice up the dead guy because people be crazy?  seems legit.</comment>

<comment>The autopsy wouldn't have helped. Nothing would help.  These people will believe what they want to believe regardless of the evidence that says they're wrong.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Then the conspiracy would be that they ordered a bogus autopsy to cover their tracks when normally an autopsy wouldn't be required.</comment>

<comment>An autopsy wouldn't have quelled anything. That's the thing with conspiracy theories ; any evidence can simply be ignored by claiming it was forged by the conspiracy.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that local JP should have thought of that. It's incredibly suspicious that she chose to follow procedure and the family's/phycisians wishes. </comment>

<comment>I don't get the conspiracy stuff. He was 79, had some heart issues. The simplest explanation here is the most likely.</comment>

<comment>The simplest explanation is always most likely. At least, that's what the Occam's razor principle states. But that's only for simple-minded and naive people, of course.</comment>

<comment>There are conservatives who think Obama created hurricane Sandy so he could get re-elected.nuff sed</comment>

<comment>HAARP. Chemtrails. It's a proven fact. They can't put it on Youtube unless it's true..</comment>

<comment>I do. The pillow thing was initially suspicious, and it wasn't just conservatives questioning it. That's why reporting the story is so important the first time around, and the burden falls squarely on the media in this case.</comment>

<comment>Then you don't understand the yuuge money to be made peddling such tripe.</comment>

<comment>Dear God,It's not too late.Give us back Scalia.Please take Killary instead.Thanks,-A voter</comment>

<comment>Seems god was tired of Scalia's BS.</comment>

<comment>I think it was a clerical error.</comment>

<comment>I think this proves there is a God, and She is just.</comment>

<comment>Blood clots work miracles inside the head of Bill's wife.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you traditionally vote for God...</comment>

<comment>It was a polite request, not a vote.</comment>

<comment>Why wasn't Scalia given an autopsy?God only knows what might have come out. We learned our lesson back in the day with Pandora.</comment>

<comment>The missing piece here is that he died on the exclusive ranch of a wealthy and powerful guy entitled by his wealth and power to discretion. Everybody in the county would know what this place was and would treat it differently.I don't think Scalia died of anything but natural causes, but I'd be willing to bet that everybody, from the local cops to the JP, was deferring to the rich guy who owned the ranch</comment>

<comment>Natural causes + a little blue pill?</comment>

<comment>You must watch a lot of Dukes of Hazzard. </comment>

<comment>Because in real life people never defer to the wealthy and powerful.</comment>

<comment>Nothing suspicious could ever happen in TEXAS.</comment>

<comment>I would think Texas would be among the places most keen on Scalia's brand of judicial temperament.</comment>

<comment>The family didn't want an autopsy. Interesting.</comment>

<comment>I heard he was Carradine'd.</comment>

<comment>The proper term is "Fostered."</comment>

<comment>Jesus Christ, people, the man was 79, fat as a 4-H hog, and too frail to undergo surgery. End of story.</comment>

<comment>You are out of touch.  4H hogs are much leaner these days that Scalia was.</comment>

<comment>What are you covering up?</comment>

<comment>So you're saying you endorse the theory of a CIA heart attack gun with melting bullets of untraceable poison?</comment>

<comment>Valerie Jarrett takes no prisoners.</comment>

<comment>The autopsy was denied over-the-phone.The 'judge' had no basis for such a decision, only hearsay.However the family has not come forward with wanting one, or have given any remarks on the situation.It's a family situation and they have made arrangements for the visitation and funeral.Obama will not be attending, so says the White House proudly.All that does is work up the froth again as to whether Scalia, Obama's mortal enemy, did die a 'natural death.'</comment>

<comment>The family would probably prefer to not have to deal with the sort of circus that would come along with Obama's attendance.  It'll be enough of a circus as it is, most likely.  The kindest thing Obama can do for Scalia's family is stay away.</comment>

<comment>Red states don't like paying for autopsies.</comment>

<comment>Texas law allows telephone pronouncements of death.What could go wrong?</comment>

<comment>The problem is Texas happens to be huge. Administering a vast and in many places largely empty state comes with some compromises.</comment>

<comment>You kinda need to when you have a county 3,800 square miles in size with less than 8,000 people in it and only a handful of people who can legally pronounce death.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if Thomas is worried.</comment>

<comment>Politics aside -- it doesn't matter what one thinks of Scalia -- any time one of the most powerful humans in the US (not to mention the planet) dies outside of a hospital setting, an autopsy should be conducted.The appearance of impropriety should always be avoided -- that's just common sense.</comment>

<comment>I have to agree, but it could conflict with the wishes of the family.</comment>

<comment>Gone Without a Case: Suspicious Elder Deaths Rarely Investigatedhttps://www.propublica.org/art...For the sake of political transparency it would have wise to do an autopsy on Scalia.</comment>

<comment>In some states an autopsy is mandated if the death is unattended.  It's a powerful family. Maybe they intervened. </comment>

<comment>Can you list those states?  I don't know of any.  The percentage of deaths in the U.S. that involve any sort of formal post-mortem examination has been falling for years.</comment>

<comment>Kansas is one. I have a copy of a relative's autopsy under that law.  So are you a birfer too, and are bigfoots real?</comment>

<comment>no, I won't list the states. If you're too lazy to do your own lifting, you're probably a birfer, and interacting with loons like that is very trying. Once you got your conspiracy strapped on, it's until you die.</comment>

<comment>Did you read the story? It specifically cites Texas law.</comment>

<comment>no. I don't need post mortems on scalia. It suffices that he's dead. I leave it to birfers and the like to pretend it's a conspiracy. Quite a jackpot he threw the republicanists into. Now the ninth circuit rules.</comment>

<comment>It might be better to ask Scalia's family that question as apparently they didn't want one. If that was the case then it was their decision to make and no one else's. Of course  conspiracies are running rampant and I'm sure at some point President Obama's name will be mentioned as being involved in Scalia's demise in some way or other. There is no low to which Republicans won't stoop to bring President Obama into somehow. The man is dead let him rest in peace.</comment>

<comment>OMG, get real. Gay Barry is too much of a wuss to kill anyone. Valerie Jarrett, on the other hand....</comment>

<comment>Maybe they were in on it?</comment>

<comment>No doubt Glen Beck and Limbaugh have their theories on it which could well involve Obama or his administration. That's how the crazy gang think.</comment>

<comment>Important to consider that Arafat wasn't autopsied for YEARS....</comment>

<comment>Kenny Lay where are you?</comment>

<comment>Scalia was a pretty committed catholic, so it stands to reason that his family probably is too. Some of the more conservative catholic factions decline an autopsy unless there is a direct evidence of foul play because an autopsy theologically speaking desecrates the corpse. That might be a reason for the family declining an autopsy.I would have ordered it, with the kind of stakes of this election year, the death of a supreme court justice shouldn't have a shadow of a doubt to what was the cause of death. </comment>

<comment>They probably just knew that he was sick to begin with, so they already knew why he died.</comment>

<comment>A priest at least showed up so the poor guy wouldn't be stuck in purgatory.He got the express lane to hell I would guess.</comment>

<comment>Coming from a supporter of mass human killing.Irony. </comment>

<comment>That isn't how purgatory works. If he was going to hell he'd be there already. If he isnt, he definitely has some work to do, probably on the first, the third, and the sixth terrace</comment>

<comment>Where will Obama go?  Is there a place lower than hell for the idiot Obama?</comment>

<comment>There's not even any hell.  Or heaven or gods and Scala's death was hardly extraordinary....lessen yore one o them birfers...</comment>

<comment>You are a sad excuse for a human being. Why so miserable?</comment>

<comment>Exactly, it's best to nip any unfounded conspiracy theories in the bud, even if something shady didn't occur.</comment>

<comment>Everything happened so quickly. No time to give it more thought.</comment>

<comment>Or they knew he was in ill health while sitting on the bench and they aren't looking to advertise that.</comment>

<comment>As long as it wasn't a mental health issue, and his physical condition allowed him to execute his duties, I don't see why that would be an issue</comment>

<comment>Having seen quite enough of this man from the outside, why would anyone be interested on what was going on inside?</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you should read his contributions rather than reacting to political talking points. </comment>

He/she loves to lie about me and seems to be so over the top impressed with me being a part time CPA that I would lie about it, like its something I would brag about.</comment>

<comment>Hard to say. I think your special.</comment>

<comment>By not performing an autopsy on late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Presidio Co. Judge Cinderela Guevara likely violated state law.According to the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, a justice of the peace shall conduct an inquest into the death of a person who dies in the county served by the justice if any of the following conditions are met:– The body or a body part of a person is found, the cause or circumstances of death are unknown, and:(A) the person is identified; or(B) the person is unidentified;-the circumstances of the death indicate that the death may have been caused by unlawful means;or-the person dies without having been attended by a physician;All of which would seemingly apply to the circumstances surrounding the death of Scalia, yet Guevara decided to “certify” the cause of his death over telephone without ever seeing the body.</comment>

<comment>No amount of excuses will return the "horse to the barn" now forIt was incredibly unwise not to order an autopsySurely someone in the present adminustration should have been aware of a similar case in Argentina caused the electoral defeat of the Peronists about one year ago...</comment>

<comment>Adding to the confusion is the realitythat only his most devoted followersbelieve that this POTUSis a paragon of truth...</comment>

<comment>Another problem is that covert political murders occur throughout the worldlook at Putin's enemies' deaths, the long record of such assassinationsby the Castro regime, and last years murder of prosecutor in Argentina...Given this circumstance we now have a second and different Cinderela story...</comment>

<comment>I'm starting to wonder if anyone reads anymore. Throughout ancient and modern history political assassinations have been the norm not aberrant. The lack of them in the US is one of the things that makes us a stable country although lower level judges in Federal and State systems are killed often enough by organized crime thugs and disgruntled criminals.</comment>

<comment>You can't conduct a death investigation "over the phone"!!!!</comment>

<comment>Blame Texas</comment>

<comment>Like an autopsy would satisfy conspiracy theorists.If you're going to plan a Hollywood-style assassination of a conservative justice you'd go for Alito or Roberts and not the guy clinging to life.</comment>

<comment>I'm 100% sure Scalia died of natural causes. But, come on.  He was a Justice for the highest court in the land.  At least do an autopsy.</comment>

<comment>His family didn't want it.</comment>

<comment>Had he died anywhere else but TX there probably would have been one. They're not known for having highly intelligent residents.</comment>

<comment>The conspiracy theorists are not just nuts, they believe the end of America is moments away. This is frightening, for you take the lunatic fringe, add easy access to guns, add apocalyptic frenzy, and wow, hold on. Madness is contagious, so I worry until Mr Obama, whom I'd grade as B+, leaves office.Policy aside, I hope Kasich wins because the crazies will simmer down, gun sales will decline, the apocalypse will be postponed. Unlike Cruz/Trump, Kasich won't feed the crazies.For a sample of the wacko views, see Right Wing Watch. </comment>

<comment>Sadly, Kasich is much too sane to get much traction in this year's circus. Although I keep seeing Ohioian Dems weighing in on him being a lot more of a right wing reactionary than he appears.</comment>

<comment>Scalia died on February 13. February 13! Are you kidding me?Tennessee Ernie Ford was born on February 13! Waylon Jennings died on February 13, just like Scalia! And in 1984 (1984!) Konstantin Chernenko succeeded Yuri Andropov as general secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union--also on February 13!!Man, things have gone farther than I thought. I gotta sit down...[LittleWillie collapses on the sofa, nearly crushing a cat. He opens a pill bottle, shakes a few tablets into his mouth, washes them down with a double shot of Old Grand-Dad]First thing tomorrow I'm gonna can another case of peaches and cook up another pound or two of venison jerky, just to be on the safe side...</comment>

<comment>What kind of venison you catching down there, or should I say venado?</comment>

<comment>Stay away from the "meat on a stick" they sell to tourists and protesters outside President Correa's digs in El Centro Historico. It's tasty as hell, but you'll have the runs for a good three weeks. Trust me on this one.</comment>

<comment>Justice Scalia had been plagued by a painful shoulder, and was recently told it wasn't safe for him to undergo surgery. A heart that weak is never a good sign, and sudden death is sadly, not a surprise. His family knew this, and requested that no autopsy be done. Let's let them grieve in peace.</comment>

<comment>I have never lied about you. I have merely repeated your claims, and said that I doubt some.</comment>

<comment>I don't take your alleged education and credentials seriously! So, yeah. Just shut it. You look paranoid, posting this in a thread about a man who just passed. </comment>

<comment>I was commenting on the late Justice Scalia. You're the one who brought this up. Made it alllll about you. Again.</comment>

<comment>That wasn't in this thread. This is about Justice Scalia. Yes, I did give unfavorable opinions about you in another thread, in response to another poster who brought you up. And yes, two others entered the discussion. I object to those being referred to as lies, however.I think we should return to the subject at hand. I am sorry that the Scalia family has to deal with this conspiracy silliness at such a difficult time.</comment>

<comment>79 year old men die every day after being attacked by blue-ringed octopuses... a thousand miles away from the ocean.  Nothing suspicious about that.  The "eye in the pyramid symbol" drawn on his forehead with sharpie was probably left over from the night before.  Nothing suspicious, no siree!</comment>

<comment>Maybe he's still alive.  Another vast right wing conspiracy. Check area 51.</comment>

<comment>That would be a left wing conspiracy- no?</comment>

<comment>What activity or event that a Justice of the Peace could be involved in, takes priority over going to the scene of a Supreme Court Justice's death?The ranch had an air strip.</comment>

<comment>It's standard procedure to not perform an autopsy if the decedent has existing issues/conditions that could cause death, and that the death appears to be a consequence of those issues/conditions.   Scalia was obese and had a heart condition (maybe congestive heart failure) that was severe enough to preclude him as a candidate for surgery.    The ME will do an investigation by interviewing people who saw or talked to him, and the ME will attribute the death to those health problems unless there is evidence to the contrary.My dad had stomach cancer and died at age 72.  No autopsy.  We did call 911, and they called the ME's office for us.  My dad went straight to the mortuary and his death cert indicates that the primary cause of death was dehydration and the secondary cause of death was adenacarcinoma.  FYI -- we kept my dad at home and not the hospital.  People who are terminal -- their body functions shut down, including the desire/need for fluids.  My mom was a nurse.That's how these things work.</comment>

<comment>Right. If you ever want to kill someone, smother with a pillow a heart decease sufferer. No one will even bother to check.</comment>

<comment>We've all seen too many damned CSI episodes. Time for some media outlet to write "Will an autopsy show if someone was smothered by a pillow?"By the way, if any of us are found lying peacefully dead in an undisturbed hotel room a couple weeks shy of 80, there won't be an autopsy either. </comment>

<comment>Well, if it was "any of us", it would most likely take the "hotel room" circumstance to even discover our cold body before it starts to rot. Not too many of us sit on the Supreme Court though.</comment>

<comment>He was at a secret resort in the middle of nowhere.  The owner of it has been making a big deal about how much he respects the privacy of his guests and won't say anything else.  Scalia was there with an "unnamed companion."  He was found dead in bed.  On Valentine's day weekend, without his wife.They know how he died, they just don't want to drag his name through the mud.</comment>
