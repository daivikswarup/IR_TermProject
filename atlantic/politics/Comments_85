<comment>What is befuddling is the republican war on a woman's right to decide.</comment>

<comment>Republicans want government small enough to fit in a woman's vagina</comment>

<comment>....which they would still want to crawl into in order to legislate.  This issue succinctly exposes the entire small government mantra as an absolute pox.</comment>

<comment>What makes you claim that?I'm afraid I'm not sure I understand. Granted I'm not American, but it seems like Democrats are generally the ones supporting things like prenatal care and childcare, making sure kids in poor families can get enough food, etc.</comment>

<comment>The word for which you seek is fetus.  It is helpful to start with a basic understanding of the subject before entering debate, so suggest writing it down.</comment>

<comment>Fetus is a stage of development, not a limitation of its humanity.  What do you think is inside the womb before birth, a potato?  Look at some in-utero photographs or video on an unborn child and tell me that it's a potato in there.  Does it magically transform into a baby after passing through the birth canal?</comment>

<comment>I can only recommend basic biology or human anatomy, otherwise, you risk sounding like Mr Potato Head your entire life.</comment>

<comment>Since you are the master of biology, tell us when does an unborn child deserve legal protection?  Don't be a Mr. Potato Head...just answer.</comment>

<comment>You're at it as well.  No helping those who attempt to answer civil, medical or legal questions with the good book.  Put down the pipe.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't a hard question.  You ignored it and added a bit of ad honimen to go.  Nothing in my question was about the "good book." Put down the arrogance and answer the question.</comment>

<comment>Another deflection.(Definitely a pattern forming here)</comment>

<comment>At first breath.</comment>

<comment>An indefensible, illogical, and unscientific positon at best, but at least you admit what you believe.  Most pressed on the subject realize how illogical the belief is and they won't say it.</comment>

<comment>Why, it is a reality and undeniable fact that until AFTER a successful birth takes place a fetus is only a possible life</comment>

<comment>Because that baby could have been born the previous day or week and nothing about it would have changed.  Whether life is worth protecting cannot depend upon where it lives.</comment>

<comment>You think developmental stages and facts are irrelevant?  If there is NO successful birth there is NO babyWell unfortunately for you reality and fact says they are not</comment>

<comment>What in the world are you babbling about, legal abortion is no longer available at 24 weeks. And those who do have late term abortions do so because they are wanted pregnancies gone terribly wrongIf it is using another against said others will it most certainly is morally and ethically wrong to force said other to suffer especially since a fetus before 26-29 weeks gestation simply does not have the functional brain structure to be aware of anything</comment>

<comment>The latest research says that up to 75% of all conceptions miscarry, often before the woman even knows she is pregnant. It is a fetal holocaust you should do something!http://americanpregnancy.org/p...http://miscarriage.about.com/o...All those dead "babies" why arte you not demanding their lives are saved, why no money or research stopping this death?</comment>

<comment>You are using Loki's Wager. It's a fallacy, so I suggest you stop using it. You can experience pregnancy loss at any stage and it's still pregnancy loss.It stops becoming a potential life when it emerges live from the womb. It's not about "location." It's about biology. Physiological changes occur at first breath, without which, life on the outside would be impossible. Fetuses have holes in their hearts that shunt blood flow away from the lungs, among other differences.</comment>

<comment>Again, you hold a position that most people of morality cannot hold.</comment>

<comment>Who asked them to? Here's the only thing you have to do: Mind your own fucking business. No, SERIOUSLY. MIND YOUR BUSINESS. No one needs your permission, and I guarantee you they won't ask for it.</comment>

<comment>Thankfully for most of the helpless in the world,  not everyone simply minds their own business.  That is why slaves were freed and why we have a humane society. I don't need your permission to care, to vote and to do what I please.  You are on the losing side of an issue (to say nothing of your sanity)</comment>

<comment>Abortions do not harm helpless people in the world. You do not solve perceived "fetal slavery" by enslaving WOMEN instead.Realize this... Women are people. Fetuses aren't. Women aren't going back. Women are accustomed to having as many or as few children as they wish, and are willing to go to great lengths to preserve that. You will not stop them. You've never been able to stop them.</comment>

<comment>There's nothing "illogical" about it. Women are not walking incubators. If it can't take a breath, it has no rights.</comment>

<comment>Well it CAN take a breath long before birth.  Your logic condones infanticide, but at least you are not shy about it.  Thankfully, people who think like you are rare.</comment>

<comment>So, if it can take a breath, fine. Then it can be removed.</comment>

<comment>Preemies live at between 22 and 24 weeks gestation.  You just changed sides.</comment>

<comment>Because nobody is talking about preemies who can survive. We're discussing abortion. At least that's what I thought.</comment>

<comment>You might want to review the threadBTW:"ccording to the Guttmacher Institute, which conducts research on sexual and reproductive health and abortion, only 1.2 percent of all the abortions in the United States take place after 20 weeks gestation. (“Late-term” does not have a specific definition, but some states that prohibit later abortions define them as occurring after 20 weeks.) "1.2 percent of 1.2 million is around 14,000</comment>

<comment>And what does that tell you?</comment>

<comment>At viability as the law currently sets it since that is when it is closer to being an actual life like the woman already is.to deny the humanity of the woman and pretend that the womb is some neutral location like Switzerland shows how sick your stance really is</comment>

<comment>Viability has been changing with technology for a while.</comment>

<comment>No it has not, what is it with you anti-choicers and your unwillingness to accept reality?</comment>

<comment>NOThere has been no major improvement for fetal survival under 24 weeks in at least the last decade or two. Contrary to the rates for those 25-26 weeks those have improved dramatically and continue to do so.Of course survival is only one aspect, 50-75% of preemies who survived have mild to significant impairments (again going back to gestational age, and better outcome) which raises questions about quality of life!http://www.dailymail.co.uk/hea...http://www.nursinginpractice.c...http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/hea...http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bo...As for that recent claim about 22 weeks, this what the experts have to say about that;http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/1...Straight from that study ;"none of 29 infants born at 22 weeks' gestation survived, as compared with 6 of 40 (15 percent) born at 23 weeks, 19 of 34 (56 percent) born at 24 weeks, and 31 of 39 (79 percent) born at 25 weeks. There were seven stillbirths at 22 weeks' gestation and four stillbirths at 23 weeks."And then there is your claim about the 22 weeks as critiqued by the experts; “It confirms that if you don’t do anything, these babies will not make it, and if you do something, some of them will make it,” said Dr. David Burchfield, the chief of neonatology at the University of Florida, who was not involved in the research. “Many who have survived havesurvived with severe handicaps.”And the statement on the 22 week claim made by the overarching organizations of doctors who do this for a living; "the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics said that “in general, those born at 23 weeks of gestation should be considered potentially viable” because more than a quarterof such babies survive when treated intensively. The report clearly and unequivocally  states nothing helps babies born at less than 22 weeks to survive."And then there is the little FACT that hospitals routinely do not offer treatment to any preemie born under 23 or even 24 week gestation because of the dismal outcomes. And the FACT that parents canlegally, and often do refuse treatment for preemies that young.</comment>

<comment>No.</comment>

<comment>Deflection again</comment>

<comment>Nope. A stillborn doesn't magically transform into anything other than what it is. A dead fetus.Here's the issue: Regardless of how human you believe yourself to be, nobody is obligated to use their body to keep you alive. Not even after that person has died, and no longer needs their body.As for fetal life, it transforms in meaningful and physiological ways upon first breath. At that point, it's no longer dependent upon the use of a body that it has no right to use, but has been using with consent.</comment>

<comment>Deflection</comment>

<comment>It's a fetus.  Emotional terms are the refuge of the uneducated.  Perhaps the reason you didn't make Staff.</comment>

<comment>I didn't make Staff Sergeant because I got out after four years.When I left I had 23 months in grade as an E-5 so I'm pretty sure that I would've made Staff Sgt at some point if I'd elected to reenlist.Practice that deflection some more. Try to add some subtlety to it.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your service, it is greatly appreciated.Snarky comments deserve no less and if one seeks an answer, it is best to start by asking a well-framed question.</comment>

<comment>It's the result of extensive politicking, both by pro-choice and pro-life organizations.Pro-choice Republicans get hammered by the pro-life political organizations in the primaries, then get hammered by pro-choice political organizations.  Pro-life Democrats get the same hammering by opposite organizations.It's a terrible shame, because reproductive rights are a moral issue, and should not be a part of any political platform.</comment>

<comment>Reproductive rights are a moral issue? Reproductive rights have been made a political platform by the party that supports personhood bills, supports employer's refusal to allow employees under their own health insurance to cover the bc they choose, and uses every sideways method to intercept a legal procedure.</comment>

<comment>I could never figure out why reproductive rights and contraception are even a consideration of the government.</comment>

<comment>those happen to be sensitive topics because they relate to human life. That's all.</comment>

<comment>Contraception is not at all related to human life.</comment>

<comment>abortifacients are</comment>

<comment>Abortifacients are not contraceptives, either.</comment>

<comment>How are you defining contraception then? I agree that the vast majority of them don't really have bearing on the pro-life/choice debate though</comment>

<comment>None of them do. Contraceptives prevent pregnancy. Abortifacients END pregnancy.</comment>

<comment>The monthly payment on a base model (if you want to call it the) McLaren F1 including sales tax and at a 5% interest rate  on a six year loan is approximately $20,300.Tell your friend's mate he'd better start scamming a lot more people real fast or that car's going to be repo'd.</comment>

<comment>It's because they've been labelled rights.Once that became standard form governmental meddling was not only assured but it became a duty.</comment>

<comment>When are we going to drop this war on women BS and focus on actual issues that matter? People need to stop trying to impose their religious beliefs on woman's uteruses. If a person believes that abortions or birth control are "immoral" they are free to not seek those things out. That is where it should end.</comment>

<comment>Nope.  If people think that things like abortion are wrong, they are free to seek to change the law through the legislative and judicial process, as is their right to do as Americans.  Stop trying to tell people how they are and aren't allowed to participate in the democratic process.Incidentally, your "religion" argument wouldn't work on groups like Secular Pro-Life and Pro-Life Humanists....</comment>

<comment>Doesn't matter. Even if you aren't religious you are free to CHOOSE to not use birth control or have an abortion.What other women choose to do with the contents of their own bodies is absolutely nobody else's business. Stop trying to tell women what to do because you have creepy feelings for pregnancies that are of zero concern to you. </comment>

<comment>"What plantation owners choose to do with their property is absolutely nobody else's business. Stop trying to tell plantation owners what to do because you have creepy feelings for their slaves that are of zero concern to you."When it's people on the line, we reserve the right to be concerned.</comment>

<comment>Comparing abortion to slavery is an intellectually dishonest argument. Forcing women to carry pregnancies to term that they would otherwise abort is more akin to slavery than abortion is or will ever be. So leave that tired, boring, old argument at the door and explain to me why you believe it is your right to go sticking your nose between the legs of strangers and controlling their lives and choices. </comment>

<comment>I have no desire to stick my nose into someone else's legs.  Your desire is to see women's autonomy go unimpeded.  That's all well and good, but I would not extend that to the point where they can do so at the cost of a living person.  Your governing principle is to not trample on the rights of another person.  I agree, which is why the rights of the child should not be impeded either.  Otherwise, there's little distinction between an abortion and, say, a woman who decides to abandon a newborn child in a dumpster.  In either event, she's freed herself of the responsibilities of parenthood, but the outcome is still the same.</comment>

<comment>A developing fetus is not the same thing as the fully grown, sentient woman who carries the fetus. It has zero awareness of its existence. It is of no concern to you or anyone else what any woman chooses to do with her pregnancy.Why do you think a developing fetus deserves the same full rights as a person who has been born? Why do you value fetuses more than living, breathing, sentient human beings? That is bizarre and creepy.</comment>

<comment>Why do you think I value one more than the other?  If they're both human, they're both valued.  What do you value more, a 6 year old boy in California, or a 36 year old woman in Madagascar?Unborn children likely have less sentience, sure.  They still react to pain, noise, food, etc.  That photo that's circulating of the unborn child who's holding the hand of her dying twin has to mean something.  (Here you go, it's in People magazine: http://www.people.com/article/...  What would you tell the parents of those babies?  "Sorry you lost your fetus.  At least you have another one.  It's cute that they're holding hands, but it doesn't mean anything."That said, what's your cutoff for killing a child if you were queen?  Because a 1-day or 1-week or 1-month old child doesn't have much awareness of its existence either to the rational level you're demanding.  If a mother of a newborn is overwhelmed or tired of parenting, should the law allow her to drown or quietly smother it?  What's your age cutoff?  Two?  Six?  Seventeen?  Be honest here.  Again, what's the sentience distinction between a eight-month unborn baby and a baby eight months after birth?</comment>

<comment>Hysterical, hyperbolic metaphors.I don't give a damn what any woman chooses to do when pregnant. The choice is HERS to make. Not mine, not yours, not anybody else's. Considering you are not a woman, your opinion on this topic holds no inherent worth. If YOU don't want an abortion you are free to not get one. You are not free to make that choice for anyone else.Perhaps the solution to abortion for guys like you is to force all male children who reach puberty to undergo reversible vasectomies that they can have undone at a later date when they can prove they are financially and emotionally stable enough to handle being a father.</comment>

<comment>You call me "hysterical," and then you propose giving all men forcible vasectomies.  Have you read what you've written?If my opinion holds no inherent worth, then do the opinions of pro-life women matter?  Because there's lots of those.  We're told over and over to "listen to women" on this topic, but then women do speak and you tell them to shut up.  These include women who are mothers, who've had abortions and regret it, who've been through poverty.  Are the stories of women who regret abortion over at Abort73 (http://www.Abort73.com) completely worthless?  If I should listen to women, why should I listen to you and not them when they all speak about how bad it was?Last question, and you won't like this.  Chew on it and don't answer me if you don't want to.  If you had a time machine and went to the past, and found your mom was contemplating an abortion, would you support and encourage her to do it?  Try really hard not to dodge this question on the "it's stupid and you're being hysterical" standard.  Try being intellectually honest here--would you be fine with having been aborted?I think we're done here otherwise.  Nice talking to you.</comment>

<comment>What is wrong with forcing men to undergo vasectomies until they are financially and emotionally ready to handle raising a child.It's funny how once it is your (presumed) manhood that is up on the chopping block, suddenly we shouldn't interfere with people's reproductive organs. Proving my point that you do not value women at all.I don't think pro-life women's opinions hold any worth either unless it is their own pregnancy of which they are speaking of. You see, I really don't think what other people do in the bedroom and what goes on inside other people's bodies is the business of anyone else and it is beyond creepy that pro-lifers think they deserve complete access to the body of every woman.If a woman gets an abortion and regrets it later, that is on her and it isn't my problem if she regrets her choice. Those women are welcome to seek therapy and move on. They are not allowed to force their views on other women simply because they have regrets. Plenty of women feel relief after terminating a pregnancy for a number of reasons. Abortion is not a one size fits all solution to every pregnancy, but neither is being goaded into giving birth under extreme duress. Abortion is not a black and white issue. Until you understand that all you are going to do is waste time with your unwelcome nonsense.</comment>

<comment>OK, so a woman gets an abortion and goes through horrible emotional pain, and you're completely OK with that because it furthers your agenda.  "Sorry you feel bad, but thanks for taking one for the team!"  That's pretty insensitive for the side that's supposed to be pro-woman.  Maybe you should go read some of those stories at Abort73 and make sure you know what you're talking about.  Unless you don't want to be fully informed about the pain that other women have gone through.I do note that you keep dodging some of the darker questions here, like whether you'd have been OK with your mother aborting you, or whether a parent can kill a two-week old child.  I'm guessing you don't want to answer it because it leads to a very dark position.  That's fine, but it's also drastically inconsistent with your advocacy.But like I said, I think we're done here.</comment>

<comment>If I don't know the woman, it really isn't my place to care. Terrible things happen to people all of the time. Do you care about each and every one of those people as much as you pretend to care about women who regret abortions?I never said women getting abortions "furthers my agenda". Here is the thing, I a woman gets an abortion I. DO. NOT. CARE. It is not my place to care. All I am saying is every woman deserves to have a CHOICE. I don't have to agree with the choice she makes, but i also realize that unless I am living her life and walking in her shoes it is no more my place to take choices away from her than it is yours or anyone else's.I "dodge" your "darker questions" because they are hypothetical, idiotic, and unworthy of acknowledgement, let alone answers. I understand you want to somehow build that into a more complex than it is, but honestly it is that simple. There is no doubt in my mind that you will use my refusal to answer your stupid questions to frame me as some kind of monster because hysteria and hyperbole are all you have.</comment>

<comment>You are sad, illogical and inflammatory.  If you care enough to devote pages to the topic, the least you could do is learn to argue with logic.</comment>

<comment>The least you could do is leave people who are not you alone and let them make their own choices in life. What pregnant women do is none of your business.</comment>

<comment>If you would actually present a logical reason other then emotional hyperbole and ridiculous assertions that zygotes are babies or that adult women should not be able to make their own decision because they might regret them, that would be a tad easier</comment>

<comment>There has been no emotional hyperbole nor ridiculous assertions on my part, but even if their had been, your logic should have been unimpeded. Have a good day.</comment>

<comment>You want us to argue your inane assertions that zygotes are people or life begins at conception? Why, reality clearly can't do the job what could we possibly contribute that is more convincing then reality?</comment>

<comment>"OK, so a woman gets an abortion and goes through horrible emotional pain"..I haven't seen any statements from you expressing concern for any women who regret NOT getting an abortion.Did I just miss it?</comment>

<comment>I'm not following your odd logic.  I empathize that a person is going through hardship.  I'm having trouble agreeing with "regret that they didn't get an abortion" when I've been saying throughout here that I'm pro-life and believe the child should be protected.  I'm sad about the hardship.  I can't be sad that someone didn't kill a child.</comment>

<comment>Hmm, I thought it was implied but I guess my thought process isn't as clear to other people as it is me.Reading through those comments, it seemed to me like you were implying that we need to take abortion more seriously because of how many women regret it, and that standing by and letting all these women make a decision they'll regret is bad somehow.It seems like it's ignoring a huge part of a double sided coin though...if you try to argue that we need to protect these women, then we should be worried about protecting them from a pregnancy they would regret too.</comment>

<comment>...in brief, I'll say that I appreciate the sentiment of what you're saying without wanting to go further down the rabbit hole.  These contentious arguments have contentious sub-arguments and we could be at this all night if I wanted to keep qualifying stuff. </comment>

<comment>People regret having children all the time. DEAL WITH IT.</comment>

<comment>95% of women do not regret having an abortion. The highest satisfaction rating for any medical procedure ever. http://www.medicalnewstoday.co... Clearly your concerns are misplaced and you should agitate for laws stopping people from having plastic surgery http://www.foxnews.com/story/2...</comment>

<comment>"OK, so a woman gets an abortion and goes through horrible emotional pain, and you're completely OK with that because it furthers your agenda."YES, I am OK with that. It's a part of life.</comment>

<comment>How about forcing women to have a tubal ligation instead of using abortion as birth control?</comment>

<comment>Nope. Women have suffered enough at the hands of creepers like you. Let boys/men have a turn in taking one for the team regarding fertility/reproduction.Obviously you find this argument flawed because you hate women and worship male reproductive parts above all else.</comment>

<comment>Guess what? I am a woman. It's you feminists which give the rest of us a bad name in the minds of men.</comment>

<comment>Sorry excuse for a woman if I ever saw one.</comment>

<comment>I consider men and women as equals, unlike feminists who denigrate men and ask for special rights.</comment>

<comment>No you don't you hate women and worship the male anatomy as your leader supreme.</comment>

<comment>I don't worship anything or anyone.</comment>

<comment>You made it abundantly clear that you worship and live your life for penises.</comment>

<comment>LOL! I don't have a penis, but those who have them are nice to have around sometime. Are you a lesbian?</comment>

<comment>Nope. But your life obviously revolves around penises and your constant need of attention from men. </comment>

<comment>I don't even have a man in my life right now. I've been divorced for 30 years and only have a few male friends without benefits. I've worked with mostly men throughout my life and get along with them much better than with catty women who think they're all that.</comment>

<comment>Ever stop and think maybe you are the problem?</comment>

<comment>I treat them equally and vice versa. More women should try it.</comment>

<comment>Sure you do. I can tell by your immature and catty behavior that you prefer to worship men and placate them while throwing other women under the bus to do so. </comment>

<comment>I'm sorry you can't handle the truth. That's why people hate feminists.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be the one who is unable to handle the truth.</comment>

<comment>Anti-choice WOMEN do not get to make decisions for other women, either.And yes, I would have been fine with being aborted. I wouldn't have known it. Existential angst is something the mature deal with in childhood. Here you go... The world was turning before there was a you, just as it will continue turning after there's no longer a you. "But, but... what if there was no MEEEEEEE?" Is one of the least compelling arguments I've ever heard on the topic. </comment>

<comment>Vasectomies carry no risk to life or health, something that clearly can not be said of pregnancy or birth.  Nonetheless you go in a snit when YOUR bodily autonomy is threatened, telling.</comment>

<comment>What an appropriate name you have...Savage.</comment>

<comment>The true savages are people who believe that for some reason they deserve the right to control the choices others make.Learn to mind your own business.</comment>

<comment>Savages are those who think nothing of killing the unborn.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Savages are those who think it is their right to force their will on others. A woman who chooses abortion does so at no detriment to you. It is incredibly creepy that you somehow think you deserve you insert your views into the lives of others and control the choices that they make. Get over yourself.</comment>

<comment>When you kill the unborn, you are not considering the life of another. In other words, it's a selfish act.</comment>

<comment>That is not up to you or me to decide. If you don't agree with abortion the solution is simple, don't get one! Nobody is forcing you to get an abortion. Why do you think it is your place to for women to carry pregnancies to term? Why do have such creepy feelings for fetuses that do not belong to you? Answer me that without perpetuating the lie that you "care about life". Explain in real terms what YOU personally get out of forcing women you do not and will not ever know to carry their pregnancies to term. What is in it for you?You do not have the right to tell anyone else what choice they may or may not make regarding the contents of their own bodies. End of story. </comment>

<comment>I can't force a woman not to have an abortion. But I can work toward reversing the law that allows it. Many forms of birth control are available, but must be used to prevent pregnancy.</comment>

<comment>So what? Birth control fails. Condoms break. Women get raped. There are ectopic pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and a plethora of developmental and birth defects. But you are so hateful you don't care about any of that. You just want to control the sex lives of women.</comment>

<comment>I've heard all those useless excuses. Take the pill and use an IUD that doesn't contain hormones and the guy can use a condom at the same time. After we had our one and only child, my husband had a vasectomy and I had a tubal ligation. There's nothing like being responsible instead of killing an innocent unborn child. An ectopic pregnancy is not the same as a uterine pregnancy since the fallopian tubes aren't meant to support life or the growth of the fetus. A molar pregnancy is basically a clump of cells unable to develop as it lacks the DNA. If it's not miscarried, then a D&C is performed. So it was never a human from the start. Birth defects are rare and some aren't life-threatening and many babies with them survive through adulthood. Should abortion be used to clean the gene pool or should we allow it happen naturally. Ask those who are living who could have been aborted if they would rather be dead.</comment>

<comment>Blah blah blah.... Not your decision to make. Period.</comment>

<comment>So you don't have a valid response?</comment>

<comment>No, my response is valid. Abortions are a medical procedure. You want to violate HIPAA because you have freakish feelings for fetuses that don't belong to you. At the end of the day your immature feelings and opinion counts for nothing in the lives of others because it is none of your business what choices other women make.Being that you are this opposed to abortion, you are absolutely free to not have one. In regards to others and the choices they make for their own lives, keep your fat mouth shut.</comment>

<comment>HIPAA has nothing to do with the abortion legalization ruling. Besides, most women who have one or more abortions don't mind telling others about it. They're no better than any other boastful criminal.</comment>

<comment>Well women wouldn't have to talk about their abortions if creeps like you would shut up and mind your own business. If the fetus is not located inside of your uterus, it is absolutely none of your business what happens to it. </comment>

<comment>Their mouths aren't the only thing they need to keep closed.</comment>

<comment>Says the "woman" whose life revolves around how many penises she can cram into her body.</comment>

<comment>That's funny. I already told you I have no man in my life.</comment>

<comment>I know! You have multiples, you're that nasty.</comment>

<comment>You mad? I think you're jealous. LOL</comment>

<comment>Nah you seem to be the jealous one considering you are obsessed with fetuses that do not belong to you.</comment>

<comment>My only obsession is preventing abortions.</comment>

<comment>Yes, you have creepy and disturbing feelings for fetuses that do not belong to you. You are free to stop abortion if the fetus in question is located in your uterus. That is where it ends. What any other woman chooses to do with her pregnancy is none of your business. Full stop.</comment>

<comment>No the law doesn't allow that. Because ANYONE can care for an eight month old infant.</comment>

<comment>"Person" You keep using that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.</comment>

<comment>There's EVERY distinction between an abortion and abandoning an infant. Except that where the former is hard to come by, the latter will occur with greater frequency.</comment>

<comment>Also, "comparing abortion to slavery is an intellectually dishonest argument" is only intellectual dishonest if you alter the equation by removing the personhood of the child.  If the child is not a person, then sure, there's no comparison.  If the child is a person, then it's fair game.  After all, the slaveholders of the 19th century didn't consider the personhood of their property either.  If the abolition arguments removed the personhood of the slave, then sure, the abolitionists lose every time too.</comment>

<comment>No, it is very much so an intellectually dishonest argument and all you are doing is wasting everyone's time trying to force that ridiculous nonsense into the conversation. Can you argue against abortion without having to resort to hysterical, hyperbolic, illogical metaphors?A fetus does not deserve the same rights as an actual, living, breathing, sentient being. By doing that you are dehumanizing and devaluing women.</comment>

<comment>So in other words, you want me to argue without the parts you don't like.  Let's just zero in on one part of your issue: "living."  Can you show me how an unborn child isn't "living"?  It meets all scientific definitions of life: it moves, grows, seeks food, etc.  It even breathes, although granted the breathing is dependent on the umbilical cord at this time rather than the lungs.  It's still alive by every definition of the word.  Your side keeps claiming we're not scientific, but you keep dodging the "life" side of our argument when every indicator is that the fetus is alive.  What happens in a stillbirth--nothing?And you still haven't answered my question about the newly-born child.  If adult intellectual lives are superior to young non-sentient lives, then should a parent be able to kill a child up to a certain age if the intellect hasn't manifested yet?  That seems to be the logical end of your argument whether you want to admit to it or not.  When Kermit Gosnell killed those newborn children, was he a monster or a hero?</comment>

<comment>I try not to get involved with discussions with people who have to resort to hysteria to prove their point. Your question is ridiculous and unworthy of an answer.Yes, we can argue on a basic level a developing fetus is "alive" it is composed of living cells. It doesn't"seek" food it simply ingests the nutrients that are provided to it through the umbilical cord. That is in no way the same thing as a person going to the kitchen to find a snack in the cabinet because they are hungry. It has no self awareness, no thoughts, no dreams, no people who have bonded with it giving it a network of family and friends to fall back on for support. When an egg is first fertilized all it does is divide and multiply cells. Please explain to me how a mass of multiplying and dividing cells that hold the POTENTIAL for a life are exactly the same thing as a human that has been birthed. Please explain to me why you believe that developing fetuses hold more value than the women who bear them. </comment>

<comment>Unborn children dream: https://www.aip.org/news/2009/....  They also feel pain: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/hea...  I suppose you might argue that "hunger" is just a neurological sensation caused by the body's need for food, but that's what happens in adult people too.  Try not to be so unscientific here.Why do you keep putting words in my mouth?  I said that I value women and children the same, not one more than the other.  My desire not to see children killed doesn't mean I value them "more."</comment>

<comment>Because every comment you write makes it blaringly obvious that you do not value women unless you can exert control over their sex organs.Why do you only care about unborn babies? Where is your concern for all other the children and babies who are placed in the foster care system and suffer a multitude of abuses every day? Maybe instead of sticking your nose between the legs of women you should work on getting every unwanted and abused child who is in the foster care system a loving home before allowing more and more unwanted children to be dumped there.</comment>

<comment>Again, invented arguments.  Why do you assume that I don't care about foster and abused children?  That'd be like telling abolitionists that they didn't care about the problems of other white people who also needed help.  That's like yelling at school reform advocates for not doing more to assist in health care.  You're dodging the issue.  If we solved all the foster and child abuse issues, would you then be good with people arguing about abortion?  No?  Then stop waving that red cape as a distraction.</comment>

<comment>If we solved the issue with foster care I would say that the people who pretend that they are pro-life would have a better leg to stand on when making their argument. But as it is, all they do is prove that they don't actually care about anything but the unborn who once born hold no more value to them or their argument.</comment>

<comment>I assume you don't care, because your solution is to add to their numbers. That isn't how caring is defined.</comment>

<comment>I see you are still engaging in the deep dishonesty "argument".Read your own links, those are fetuses long after viability.You know the point where no legal abortion can be obtained unless there is a severe health crisis with the mother, the fetus or bothhttps://www.aip.org/news/2009/...  "After about seven months growing in the womb"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/hea... "after 35 to 37 weeks"Viability is at 24 weeks!!!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>Sometime between conception and birth EVERYONE agrees that the unborn child is an independent human.  The question is when.  The baby two days before birth and two days after are essentially the same baby.  To approve of abortion without deciding when the point of becoming a human happens is to simply be lazy with other people's life.</comment>

<comment>Actually the who "when does life begin?" question is quite irrelevant unless you are the one personally facing a crisis pregnancy. You don't have to like or agree with abortion, you are free to no get one. You are not free to control others because you are jealous of them.</comment>

<comment>Independent before birth? NEVER. The embryo is "human" from the beginning, and so were the ovum and sperm.It's not a person, and it's not independent.</comment>

<comment>The law already answered your "question" you just don't want to hear it because it does not suit your amoral anti-choice agenda  Viability (24 weeks) is what that point is</comment>

<comment>No, you are asked to argue using reality and factA fetus until after a successful birth takes place is only a possible life a woman is always an actual life, those are the facts no matter how much you like to deny themKermit Gosnell killed newborn children, you already answered your own question</comment>

<comment>There is no "child" or "person" involved in an abortion. You don't solve your imaginary "slavery" problem with fetuses by enslaving women instead.</comment>

<comment>Nevertheless you deliberately and willfully removing the personhood of the only actual person involved is not dishonest and amoral?!Clearly the woman FORCED to gestate and birth and risk her life and her health for the sake of Your personal opinion is indeed suffering. A zygote, fetus before viability does not suffer or feelIs it your contention that forced gestation and birth does not harm a woman?</comment>

<comment>You're on the side of the slavers, so that argument doesn't work for you.</comment>

<comment>Slaves are actual human beings, stop trying to claim that zygotes are the same as actual people</comment>

<comment>Exactly. And that's a group that will only grow. My generation is both more secular and more pro-life than the Gen-Xers and Boomers before us.</comment>

<comment>Because you haven't lived long enough to see what happens when abortion is illegal, and you are incapable of learning by watching what happens where women are disposable incubators (like Ireland).</comment>

<comment>Look at the Gosnell case. Things are no safer. </comment>

<comment>Gosnell is on YOUR hands and the anti-choicers like you.Gosnell's patients were women who could not obtain or afford a legal abortion</comment>

<comment>Not even close. He performed illegal late term. </comment>

<comment>Exactly!These women due to YOUR tactic of reducing access and chasing up the cost for legal abortions for women, YOU created women desperate enough to seek this butchers help</comment>

<comment>No. Access at early stages is easy. We're talking about Philadelphia here. </comment>

<comment>So women would rather risk a latter stage more complicated more expensive abortion because women are just like that?Get a grip. no one is buying your idiocy!</comment>

<comment>Yes. Enough women don't even realize they are pregnant to create a Discovery Channel show.</comment>

<comment>Of course you would argue this cr*pClearly there is not a shred of morality or ethics in you, your only need is to claim that women are inherently amoral creatures who will kill children any chance they get if men like you do not stop them.</comment>

<comment>People are amoral. Men would kill children as well. Some people are selfish. Look at the murder and robbery rates.</comment>

<comment>And?It is YOU who assumes ALL women are amoral and that we should base our laws on that assumption!Throughout history women have done the overwhelming majority of child rearing and 100% of all the gestating and birthing!!!!  Women have done protecting and raising children so well that we now stand at a population of 7 billion, clearly your idiotic assumptions are completely unfounded.</comment>

<comment>Keep making strawmen.</comment>

<comment>Says the guy who just argued that people are amoral and that is why all women can not have access to abortion!</comment>

<comment>You keep saying things I never said.</comment>

<comment>So you are not anti-choice and you did not just state that people are amoral?</comment>

<comment>I'm complicated on abortion and amorality was a response to one of your strawmen.</comment>

<comment>A response on why there should not be a choice to abort for women!  Do you have any honest bone in your body, Do you EVER stand by your words and what you say?</comment>

<comment>Abortion is unnecessary in an era of widespread and highly effective birth control. </comment>

<comment>Clearly not, if it was women would not ask for them</comment>

<comment>You realize other factors besides birth control are at play right? Things like the welfare state creating perverse incentives.</comment>

<comment>Oh really a woman wanting an abortion is hoping for welfare for a kid she does not want to have but YOU want to force her to have!The only one creating "incentives" to have unwanted children is you and your anti-choice buddiesRidiculous idiocy blaming women for needing welfare for the children YOU are forcing her to have against HER will</comment>

<comment>http://www.foxnews.com/story/2...http://www.heritage.org/resear...</comment>

<comment>Can you make up your mind  and apply some logic?!A woman who wants an abortion does NOT want a child so she can use it to get welfare!YOU forcing her to have a child she did not want because she can not provide for it is YOU forcing her to go on welfare so the kid YOU forced her to have has something to eat!</comment>

<comment>The two are related. Read the article.</comment>

<comment>NOT</comment>

<comment>Again read it. Human behavior is complex. </comment>

<comment>Inane and irrelevant to the subject.You do not get to force your personal believes upon another because you think said other is complex</comment>

<comment>And?  You are not proposing laws  imprisoning or putting under female guardianship all adult males because they commit the overwhelming majority of rape, robberies and murder, clearly men have no moral agency and should be controlled by women</comment>

<comment>And laws making sure abortion clinics get checked for health code standards more than once a generation don't control women. Expecting people to use birth control not infanticide doesn't control anyone.</comment>

<comment>What 5 women in a country of 125.9 million adult women in the United States  2014 according to the census!?Well then there are a lot more rapist in the US then women who do not know they are pregnant before they are 24 weeks along.  With your "reasoning" we should assume all men are rapists and base our laws on that</comment>

<comment>We're talking about far more than five. Then you have "wanted" pregnancies becoming "unwanted." You really don't accept the idea people behave stupidly or without forethought?</comment>

<comment>Having an abortion when you can not afford to take care of a child is acting responsible!  Just because your personal definition of responsible is NOT the same as her personal definition of responsible.That does not mean yours is better or at all moral or ethical, after all you want to force the consequences of YOUR personal opinion upon another. Forcing the consequences of YOUR personal opinions upon another who does not share your opinions is not responsible in the least. It is you who should shoulder the  consequences of your OWN opinions instead of seeking to inflict them upon unwilling others</comment>

<comment>No using birth control is responsible. There's dozens of varieties that all work well.</comment>

<comment>Agreed using birth control is responsible as is having an abortion.You inane claims that women would rather have multiple expensive abortions (up to $1,500 in the first trimester) then use cheaper birth control is just more of your ridiculous claims that women simply have no moral agency and must be controlled</comment>

<comment>Abortion is the lazy cop out. It's not a claim but reality.http://prospect.org/article/de...People don't always act  rationally or intelligently. Why do you think we have DUIs, smokers or heroin addiction?</comment>

<comment>That is your personal opinion based on some inane religious concept that zygote=personWhat makes you think everyone should be forced to adhere to your personal view on what form responsibility should take especially since you WILL NOT suffer the consequences of your own opinions?From your link;"Loss of access for poorer women seemed to be the sole reason for this troubling trend, which led to an explosion in unplanned pregnancy, and therefore abortion. While poor women have seen a spike, women in the middle class continued to see unplanned pregnancies decline"And you want to claim poor women for the inability to access contraception? an inability created by the anti-choice and their "religious exemption" to provide comprehensive health care for women?Wow you really are a special kind of dishonest to the core</comment>

<comment>Claims birth control is difficult to get are absurd. The only barrier is not coming from a couple religious people it's coming from PP and "feminists" standing in the way of making hormonal birth control OTC. There has been no "loss of access." The exact opposite in fact. The problems Prospect describes come from culture not access. </comment>

<comment>Poor women!Do you understand what poor means, if BC is over the counter she will loss insurance coverage putting it even further out of reach!You religious continue to claim that a womans insurance that she pays for through her employee contribution can not cover the most used female prescription medication that has done more to increase female longevity then any other prescription medication and who's non coverage will not reduce her premium one bit, she is out of even more money.BC has serious side effects and is not recommended for everyone, why are you so callous with the health of women all while claiming you just want to "protect" their health?  Ever heard of  Factor V Leiden, if a woman has this she can not use bc pills under any circumstance. Many women do not realize this, you don't care a dead women is no problem to you after all just like your other stance the consequences will not be felt by you!  So convenient to claim morals when you can force the suffering caused by  YOUR "morals" on another</comment>

<comment>Poor women have the easiest access in terms of expenses and government programs. The only issue is transport to doctors and pharmacies and that issue is solved making things OTC.Insurance is a form of pay. People have a right to negotiate pay between themselves and an employer. Not covering something in insurance denies nothing. You might as well claim people are denied 2nd Amendment rights because people aren't paid in ammo.The side effects are marginal. People can read instructions. Playing health nanny isn't the governments job.</comment>

<comment>Do you ever read? Why do you think poor women have the highest number of abortions and the more you anti-choice pass these religious objections laws the higher that number gets</comment>

<comment>Name a single case of those laws havi g any impact. You're talking about laws that respect the religious liberty of a tiny minority while having no impact on the general population. You might as well claim laws allowing Jews to be Kosher or Muslims Halal denies everyone bacon.</comment>

<comment>Read the links.Over 100 thousand women have resorted to self abortion attempts after Texass imposed these harassment laws</comment>

<comment>There's no evidence of that. And certainly no evidence of people having trouble getting the pill, IUDs or condoms.</comment>

<comment>No evidence except all the women reporting that they didOf course a misogynistic anti-choicer like you thinks a womans word is never to be counted unless it is corroborated by at least 3 men</comment>

<comment>No evidence except what women say and women are not people according to you</comment>

<comment>Except did they? How much "massaging" of the data was there? How misleading were the questions? Wouldn't be the first time stats that supported a 3rd Wave Feminist position were bogus.</comment>

<comment>And more of the women are not adults and can't understand what they are asked. In reality there were close to a quarter million (250K !!!!) women answering in the affirmative to this, the researchers collecting the data dismissed about 150 thousand positive responses to this question because of nitwits like you whining that just a woman's word is not sufficient and there must be more proof</comment>

<comment>That's the number asked not the number of answers. There was no specific time frame (they just asked ever) which makes of any recent impact nonsense. For all the pole asked a large number of these incidents could be pre-Roe. And they counted what would be legally be called hearsay. Knowing somebody was counted as an instance without any mechanism to avoid counted one incident multiple times. Think about it. One women self induces then you pole all the female people she knows who know what she did as separate instances of self induced. You've just turned one instance into 10 or 20.</comment>

<comment>Troll and a liar</comment>

<comment>Read your own links. The flaws are all there.</comment>

<comment>Gas lighting, lying, repeatedly refuted</comment>

<comment>Again look at the methodology used to get your number. It is flawed at best. Intentionally dishonest at worst. </comment>

<comment>ignored for repeated lying and doubling down on the lies without providing a single (!) link to support said lies</comment>

<comment>Sure because dismissing more then half shows they are padding the numbers@no logic, repetitive lying! ignored</comment>

<comment>Oh sure,  if you think women should not be allowed to self report without 3 men corroborating her wordsWhy do you think a woman would self report attempting to abort? are you aware that it carries a risk for harassment by law enforcement and criminal charges for her (she must rely upon the interviewer not reporting her?Are you arguing again that women have no moral agency and will brag about committing a crime any chance they get?Why would the researchers dismiss over half the responses if they are trying to pad the numbers?Lying gas lightingtrollamoral anti-choice women hater</comment>

<comment>And again with the ad hominem and strawmen. If you care about people why are you supporting the gutting of due process?</comment>

<comment>There  is no due process if a perfectly safe medical procedure is being obstructed for the sake of someone else's religious views.</comment>

<comment>LyingGas lightingtroll</comment>

<comment>Are you aware that we can all read?Your lies are just showing you up as the amoral creature you are</comment>

<comment>And more lying</comment>

<comment>Name one. The claims you cite are a feminist myth like the 1 in 4 number.</comment>

<comment>Figures you oppose quality.It is you who must prove YOUR assertions that YOUR claims are true, stop trying to make others do the work for you!</comment>

<comment>1 in 4 what?</comment>

<comment>The claim 1 in 4 college women is raped. It's a stat going backed to '07 that is still brought up to justify gutting due process and claim "rape culture" even by Senators and the President despite being completely bogus. The entire stat came from pure academic dishonesty. The survey answers were changed to get that high a number.http://www.washingtonexaminer....http://www.usnews.com/opinion/...The folks who brought that statistic are the same kind of 3rd Wave Feminists who brought your "1,000 of self induced" claim which is equally questionable or the "women earn 75¢ to the $1 men make" myth. </comment>

<comment>You just absolutely hate that women can not be used by you without any regard to what they want, don't you.People like you are all the same rape is not real and using a womans body against her will is not a problem because women are not people and consent does not apply to women in your opinionYou are done, i will no longer respond to a piece of human filth like you!</comment>

<comment>And you're back to ad hominem and strawmen. You didn't read my comment actually did you? That there is lots of evidence to be skeptical of the stats you're throwing out?That gutting due process based upon a moral panic is a bad thing?</comment>

<comment>And some more lying, gas lighting and overall trolling</comment>

<comment>The anti-choice is deliberately and willfully ignoring all medical science and  fact, they are trying to force one of the absolute safest medical procedure underground to cause more deaths ( as history and reality around the world proves over and over again)The anti-choice are literal murders and have committed numerous terrorist attacks and you think just claiming to be moral will hide what you are?!</comment>

<comment>And more ad hominem without evidence.</comment>

<comment>Provide medical support for your claim that a fetus is a person!</comment>

<comment>Trolling ignored</comment>

<comment>Ridiculous non argument completely unhinged of any form of reality. Why would any women NOT choose an early abortion if they are available and accessible?Are you actually arguing that women would rather have a difficult more involved late term abortion because they are into the pain and discomfort of surgical procedures rather then having a a quick virtually painless medical abortion?  This is your....eh.... "argument"?  PleaseDO explain what makes you think women are into pain and would rather have surgery then a medical abortion! What is your proof that women prefer to be in pain and have surgery rather then undergo something that is no different from menstrual cramps?How sad you are</comment>

<comment>Because people don't always act rationally. Sometimes people don't realize they are pregnant. Lack of access has nothing to do with it.</comment>

<comment>That is not what his victims testified, but hey you know more about what women really are and of course women should never be taken at their word, there should be at least 3 men corroborating a woman's statement before it can be trusted.  Now where did i hear about that attitude before,,,,, oh yes your buddies in ISIS</comment>

<comment>You're seriously claiming people never act irrationally? His victims were dead. </comment>

<comment>His victims were not dead by a long shot, there are plenty of women alive to testify against him but telling very telling that you do not consider women hurt and damaged by illegal abortion practices victims.Nope actual women are nothing to you, it is all about a hypothetical amazing how you just can't keep it together long enough to hide it during even a small exchange of words</comment>

<comment>He was charged with murder. Victims have to be dead for that.</comment>

<comment>One woman died, he was convicted for HER murder!Thanks again showing how depressingly little you really care, you don't even know what happened and you clearly do not care enough to find out</comment>

<comment>He engaged in infanticide. He killed far more than one person.</comment>

<comment>Convicted of HER murder</comment>

<comment>And charged with far more.</comment>

<comment>And?It is you who caused this, no matter how much you do not want to own your disgusting actions it is ALL on your head</comment>

<comment>He was charged with a laundry list. That's a big deal.</comment>

<comment>Yes it is and I'm thoroughly disgusted with people like you who want to making sure that ALL abortions are going to be like that by harassing legal abortions providers out of  existenceHow can you life with yourself being so disrespectful of actual lives</comment>

<comment>You realize the case hurts your argument right? Again read my links.</comment>

<comment>Not at all it confirms what you caused and want to make sure that ALL US women needing an abortion will have to go through!</comment>

<comment>Evidence for your absurd claims?</comment>

<comment>That's because PP has been caught in behavior many consider unethical. Places lose contracts and subsidiaries for that every day.And despite its efforts PP is not a monopoly. They are not needed for people to get birth control.</comment>

<comment>What was PP caught in that was unethical?NOTHING, your OWN anti-choice attorney generals have had to admit this over and over and over after each and every investigation</comment>

<comment>The handling of remains comes to mind. ACORN lost funding for less.</comment>

<comment>What remains?It is legal to donate human tissue for research, hoapitals do it all the time</comment>

<comment>Do you think shipping human tissue is free? Hospitals charge more for it and I don't here you whine about that</comment>

<comment>They charged more than shipping.</comment>

<comment>The same regulations that hospitals follow and have bin in place for decades, don't hear you about that!  You think shipping regulations should not make sure biological specimens are securely packaged and will not spread disease?  Idiot!The numerous (more then 10 by now) anti-choice prosecutor generals investigating found not one single shred of evidence PP broke the law, you anti-choicers however used it like toiletpaper</comment>

<comment>It wasn't pro-Lifers demanding laws not be enforced.</comment>

<comment>It was the anti-choice making sure that Gosnell had women desperate enough to prey upon AND it was the pro-choice and legitimate clinics ringing the warning bell about Gosnell</comment>

<comment>No. It had everything to do with basic laws not being enforced. </comment>

<comment>Really?  because of basic laws not being enforced there were desperate women willing to risk his care instead of going to a clean legal Planned Parenthood clinic?Do you even have a passing acquaintance with reality?</comment>

<comment>Yes. Because he was known to be willing to break the law. That other clinics sent clients to him was part of the scandal.</comment>

<comment>No legal clinics send any patients to him ever! In fact legal clinics have always called out those who perform dangerous and illegal abortions!It is just the anti-choice who wants to stop legal abortions and ensure that every single abortion  will be illegal and unregulated</comment>

<comment>Please stop hidingBack-Alley Abortion Never EndedThe Kermit Gosnell murder trial challenges a traditional defense of Roe v. Wade.By JAMES TARANTOUpdated April 18, 2013 8:11 p.m. ETSafety is one of the most potent defenses of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed a national policy of abortion on demand. Women had abortions even before it was legal to do so, the argument goes, but restrictive laws forced them to go to back-alley quacks. In this view, the story of Kermit Gosnell, the Philadelphia abortionist on trial for the murders of one woman and seven infants, is a cautionary tale about illegal, not legal, abortion. The facts tell a different story.Back-alley abortion was...To Read the Full Story, Subscribe or Sign In</comment>

<comment>And what is your argument?This confirms that he exploited women who are desperate and NO mention of legal abortion clinics sending anyone to him which is what you are claimingSo yes all it confirms is that you lie and lie and lie again</comment>

<comment>Read the article. It brings up the same referral issue as my other link.</comment>

<comment>No</comment>

<comment>"Until 2009, Gosnell reportedly performed mostly first and second trimester abortions. But his clinic had come to develop a bad reputation, and could attract only women who couldn't get an abortion elsewhere, former employees have said. "There is no mention of referrals to him by other abortion clinics  The only thing it states is "out of state referrals" ! No explanation !If legal clinincs refer for an illegal abortion they get their license yanked. If the anti-choice murderers even could get a whiff of PP referring to him they would have blown that out of the water!  Instead they just made false videos full of deceptive editing because there was no reality or fact of any crime</comment>

<comment>http://realchoice.blogspot.com...</comment>

<comment>And somehow the state prosecutor decided not to prosecute a referral to an illegal abortion that lead to a womans death because?  Sure</comment>

<comment>Maybe because they were under political pressure to not have a case that hurt the pro-choice positions of their political bosses?</comment>

<comment>BullThere has been numerous investigations of PP on behave of the lies the anti-choice continue to spew. There is one each year in pretty much each state and never any illegal or criminal activity is found but that does not stop you liars from alleging and these anti-choice GOP ers from starting yet another investigationIt is clear that you see children as a consequences that must be forced upon women, You do not love or cherish children you simply see them as a means to use them to force "responsibility on women. It is sick that you are so hell bent on forcing a child to be unwanted just so you can force your version of "responsibility" on a woman</comment>

<comment>You've never paid any attention to the video scandals have you?</comment>

<comment>All proven unsubstantiated by the GOP anti-choice attorneys who investigated them</comment>

<comment>Have you watched them?</comment>

<comment>Do you have any shred of honesty left, they have already admitted that they are "edited" and when they released the "originals" it turned out that these were also edited!All YOUR anti choice attorney generals. after a intensive investigation in which they really really tried to find something wrong,were forced to admit that PP committed not one single crime</comment>

<comment>The unedited versions are freely available and don't change a thing.</comment>

<comment>There are no unedited versions. All they have released was found to be edited, Again lying for jesus</comment>

<comment>Yes there are. The claims the videos are little more than hoaxes is a myth put out by PP.</comment>

<comment>NoEvery single law enforcement agency that investigated has stated that they are compromised, the only ones who still accredit the,m are the anti-choicers like you and other anti-choice organizations</comment>

<comment>Reality is not optionalYou are entitled to your own opinion however you must use the same facts as the rest of the world</comment>

<comment>Yes i did  the ONLY one who committed crimes were those producing these edited videos as concluded by the anti-choice prosecutor handling the case</comment>

<comment>They engaged in normal investigative journalism. If there had been honesty by the prosecutor they'd go after 60 Minutes.</comment>

<comment>Normal investigate journalism does not include committing the crimes of identity theft or lying to the IRS about your tax status, nice trySo it is pathological, you just can not tell a truth</comment>

<comment>And more lies60 minutes does Not engage in identity theft or create fake companies that they request tax exemptions for</comment>

<comment>Neither did the video people. Claiming to be someone else is a normal part of investigative journalism. Places generally don't talk to you when you show up as a reporter wanting to dig up dirt.</comment>

<comment>How strange that an anti-choice prosecutor general found evidence of them deliberately engaging in IRS fraud and identity theft.  She even apologized for the fact but stated that she just could not ignore such blatant breach of laws</comment>

<comment>The prosecutor was pro-choice in a pro-choice city.</comment>

<comment>Lying troll</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should read what you link</comment>

<comment>Anti Choice blog, real independent information you are providing.At least i can just post real medical research instead of doctored lies!</comment>

<comment>You didn't read it or the links within it did you? You also realize the pro-choice media basically blacked out the case until forced to give token coverage right? Washington Post admitted to that.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Anti choice blog is by no stretch of the imagination independent, nice try just more lies seems to be a common tactic of yoursYou know who has constantly and consistently reported on the trial of Gosnell?  Pro-choice blogs !!!!!!!!They reported on it since 2010 waaaaaaay before the regular media did!</comment>

<comment>You get the irony of complaining about sourcing while linking equally biased pro-choice articles and refusing to read the neutral articles I linked?</comment>

<comment>You have not provided ANY neutral articles and the ONLY pro-choice link i provided was in response to your allegations that the media won't cover the Gosnell trial because they are pro-choice! Nevertheless the pro-choice has covered the Gosnell case extensively and long before any anti-choicer even took noticeDo you understand how idiotic you look accusing me of bias links when you demand i proof the pro-choice has been trying to shut down Gosnell long before any of you anti-choicers got involved?!Are you pathological?</comment>

<comment>WSJ is a major newspaper.</comment>

<comment>With a pay block, nice try</comment>

<comment>That is easily gotten around.</comment>

<comment>Then why do you not post that?</comment>

<comment>Where is Gosnell? And why is he there?</comment>

<comment>In prison after a massive scandal for being a serial killer.</comment>

<comment>Not for doing abortions.</comment>

<comment>Actually yes. Everything related to those abortions was legal. From wildly unsanitary conditions to collecting body parts.</comment>

<comment>They weren't abortions. They were murders. That's why he's in prison. Nobody goes to jail for unsanitary conditions.</comment>

<comment>They were both.</comment>

<comment>No sir. He was delivering babies and murdering them. That is NOT an abortion. I suggest you stop using terms you don't fully understand, like abortion.</comment>

<comment>He called it abortion. </comment>

<comment>I can call a chicken a cow. But it doesn't make it so.</comment>

<comment>That's not what the courts thought. Or pro-choice media either who didn't touch the case with a ten foot pole because it made abortion look bad.</comment>

<comment>No, actually, pro-choice sites were complaining about Gosnell long before the Commonwealth of PA ever got off their asses... oh WAIT! They totally NEVER DID, until the place was raided by the FBI for being a PILL MILL! In the republican cesspool that is PA, who might be getting high is totally more important than women being killed.</comment>

<comment>If that was the case why did MSNBC, NY Times, Washington Post etc have to be dragged kicking and screaming to give even token coverage?</comment>

<comment>No, I don't think so. It was widely covered.</comment>

<comment>You have an odd definition of "wildly covered." </comment>

<comment>First, I didn't say "wildly covered." And it was covered on EVERY form of media, including newspapers. It might not have rated front-page status in New York or Washington. Here where I live it did. But that doesn't mean "not covered." And seriously? I doubt you read the NY Times cover-to-cover.</comment>

<comment>Only after the case became a national scandal. The Washington Post freely admits that they didn't cover it until they were forced to. </comment>

<comment>https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>You realize, that's an opinion piece. RIGHT???</comment>

<comment>Covering a major issue of media silence.</comment>

<comment>Also widespread birth control makes abortion unnecessary. </comment>

<comment>As a matter of fact, NO it does not.</comment>

<comment>It does. Abortion is the result of policies like the welfare state that discourage birth control use. There's a reason abortion rates are so heavily connected to class.</comment>

<comment>So, if welfare "discourages contraceptive use" (it doesn't... Medicaid pays for contraception, including tubal ligation) that means richer people have more abortions?</comment>

<comment>No. Welfare encourages people to have kids. There's a reason abortion rates are low and declining among the middle and upper class while up to 50% of pregnancies among the underclass. Why unplanned pregnancy rates go up the lower down you go. Welfare creates incentives that are backwards. Because you pay people more for more kids but not if you are married you get more unplanned pregnancies involving single parents. The more of those you have the higher the abortion rate. Giving away birth control doesn't counter that. </comment>

<comment>I won't go into the logical fallacies of why it can't be true that welfare encourages births AND abortions simultaneously. I'm sure you're smart enough to figure out for yourself that if welfare really did one, it couldn't also do the other.</comment>

<comment>It encourages both by creating incentives to have unplanned pregnancies. Your average woman having an abortion is a single mother in her 20s. What you have is high risk sexual behavior being the norm. That leads to both high rates of single motherhood and abortion. The two go hand in hand. A women is fine being a single mother for one or two children but can't handle three and goes for the abortion option.The idea of abortion being rich teenage girls is a myth. </comment>

<comment>No, they really do NOT "go hand in hand." And since you haven't bothered to explain how why if welfare "pays women to have kids" they would bother aborting, EVER, I'll just accept your concession.</comment>

<comment>Because there's more to raising a child than just money. Stuff like time and stress. </comment>

<comment>You do know that no woman is ever forced to raise a child, right?</comment>

<comment>Tell that to family courts that forget father's exist as anything other than living ATMs.</comment>

<comment>No man is ever forced to raise a child, either.</comment>

<comment>They are forced to pay. Even for children not their own. The family courts are a sexist joke.</comment>

<comment>Well, see, family courts are not about what's best for men. They're actually about what's best for children. Now, if a man is paying child support for a child that "isn't his" you must mean biologically not his. If he's paying support, the child is his legally.Courts are not in the business of enabling men to claim they're the daddy, and then asking for a mulligan on the whole thing when the relationship doesn't work out. It's not the court's place to get into what happened during a marriage. My ex tried that nonsense, and actually, it was his child biologically. Not that he cared.My suggestion for men is to ask for a paternity test if there's any doubt, married or single. Because the law is not going to allow you to play daddy for nine years, and then go "Oh, hey! Wait a minute..." Google estoppel.</comment>

<comment>If they cared about children they'd support father's rights. </comment>

<comment>Non sequitur.</comment>

<comment>Father's are needed in a child's life. We have a family court system that makes it harder if not impossible for fathers to be involved in their child's life.</comment>

<comment>No, not all fathers are needed in their children's lives. My ex certainly wasn't.</comment>

<comment>Nope. No we don't.</comment>

<comment>Have you read anything about the court system? Stuff like this?http://www.usatoday.com/story/...The fact that a father's rights movement is needed?</comment>

<comment>Look, I know you're desperate.  What did that fucking idiot THINK was going to happen when he ignored a court summons? That they would just disappear, and never bother him again? He's a moron! Life doesn't work that way, and I don't want to hear it!</comment>

<comment>So forcing a rape victim to pay their rapist is OK? You'd be totally cool with this if this was a female rape victim who rapist used a minor legal technicality to force them to pay child support?</comment>

<comment>Not only can female rape victims collect child support (not woman support), but male rapists can get visitation rights. Go cry me a river!</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about victims paying not receiving child support. Your entire reaction to this is sexism.</comment>

<comment>A rapist CAN get child custody and force his victim to pay support. Because it's NOT ABOUT RAPIST/VICTIM. It's about children. I do not understand what you're babbling about.</comment>

<comment>And the examples of that involve male not female victims.  We have a court system that is sexist. That shouldn't be hard to understand.</comment>

<comment>By definition if a rapist of either sex can collect child support or have visitation rights, it's not sexist.</comment>

<comment>On paper sure. The reality is that men aren't treated equally. De facto discrimination is still discrimination. If you had a disparate impact like this negatively effecting women I doubt you'd be going on about how it's OK because it isn't de jure. </comment>

<comment>Eh, there are limits to what people are able to impose on other people, though.They are free to seek that change, but they aren't free to actually ignore other peoples rights in the hopes of getting what they want. There's a reason why we're a republic, not a direct democracy.</comment>

<comment>Because "secular" pro-life is dependent upon religious beliefs, whether they want to admit it or not.</comment>

<comment>Secular pro-life and pro-life humanist can not defend their position with medical science or biology. Their "arguments" harken back to some non scientific and not medically supported views that a zygote is a human life like a woman is.</comment>

<comment>Most republicans love "small government"However, if it is your womb, your penis, your anus, or your vagina, or your life giving breasts, or who you choose to love, or who you want to have adult consensual sex with, or what substances you choose to put in your body. In those cases they oppose small government in favor of legislating their own twisted "morality."These people are just looking for ANYTHING to complain about. The economy is rolling. Health care is cheaper (still nothing compared to my $25/month car insurance from Insurance Panda or my $12/month renters insurance .. but progress is being made!!). Bin Laden is caught. Useless wars have ended.I cannot understand some people's obsession with a woman's private health matters.</comment>

<comment>You are quite right. Republicans love small government until they don't! Government can intervene all they like when it comes to interfering in a woman's right to choose. Republican hypocrisy knows no bounds!</comment>

<comment>I'd believe those complaining about "War on Women" if they weren't against OTC birth control.</comment>

<comment>Who is against that?</comment>

<comment>http://reason.com/blog/2015/05...http://www.nationalreview.com/..."Feminists" who claim to support birth control have been wildly against in for hypocritical partisan reasons.</comment>

<comment>Want to translate that into English for me, Sport?</comment>

<comment>How are those links not easy to understand?</comment>

<comment>I don't want your links. Those are biased sites. I want you to translate your statement into English.</comment>

<comment>So you didn't read them then. How is Jezebel, Planned Parenthood and other feminist and/or supposedly pro-birth control groups being against OTC birth control either because it hurts the "War on Women" narrative, hurts pro-abortion arguments or is a small government solution hard to understand?</comment>

<comment>Nobody is against OTC birth control. But you need to realize that only some birth control can be OTC. That would be, I guess, oral contraceptive tablets. I'm not even sure, with the exception of emergency contraception, that's even a good idea. Those are powerful hormones that even a doctor won't hand out to anyone who walks in the door. For example, women over 35 or who smoke.Are you a doctor, or nurse practioner? Are you any kind of health care professional? Certain idiots (republican politician/gynoticians) might believe that birth control is one-size-fits-all. Actual medical professionals, like those who head the FDA, know better. You would do well to remember that a politician promising to help women with medical issues is like a garbage man who promises to help you with stock tips. And they cannot wave a magic wand and make oral contraceptives OTC anyway. So take that with a grain of salt. And take people who opine about political reason why that isn't a good idea (rather than medical reasons) with a whole cup of salt.</comment>

<comment>Read my links. Your claim nobody is against it is absurd.Also you're rehashing the anti-birthright control people's paternalistic talking points and strawmen.</comment>

<comment>No, Will. I'm a nurse. I actually know something about the subject. I know that intellectualism is out of fashion with tea baggers. But in medical science, it's all the rage. It's not "paternalism" to keep medical practice among medical practitioners.</comment>

<comment>Your entire argument is a paternalistic strawman. Nobody supporting OTC says people shouldn't go to the doctor. Nobody claims there is a one size fits all solution.</comment>

<comment>Well, since OTC specifically means you don't need a prescription, I fail to comprehend your plan.If I need an Advil for a headache, I don't go to the doctor because Advil is OTC. I don't see why we don't make morphine OTC, it's safe when used properly. Now, explain why we don't do that.</comment>

<comment>We should. We had fewer addiction issues before drug laws.</comment>

<comment>Well, I do NOT think we should, and the reason is obvious. Because not everyone will, or even knows how to use drugs safely. Personally, I believe that either Tylenol shouldn't be OTC or it shouldn't be used in combination preparations. It's SO easy to unknowingly take an overdose that way, and it doesn't even need to be much of an overdose to cause severe liver damage. This is why you really shouldn't be opining on things you don't understand. You want your little girl or boy taking birth control pills? Because that's what OTC means.</comment>

<comment>We get ODs and abuse with prescriptions all the time. The system does nothing to make things safer. If it did you wouldn't have so many people abusing Oxy. You're pushing to make access to birth control harder. </comment>

<comment>No. I'm pushing to make access to birth control EASIER by funding Planned Parenthood. Not everyone can use oral contraceptives.</comment>

<comment>Pushing women to jump through hoops that have no medical basis is not increasing access. It decreases access. Supporting a government funded monopoly is not easing access.</comment>

<comment>But it's YOU, the non-medical professional, calling things "medically unnecessary. Why should I listen to a word you have to say?For your information, oral contraceptives are SHIT. They are only as good as the person who remembers to take them. And there will never be a DIY IUD. The IUD is now the gold standard in contraception. Not oral contraceptives. I would never recommend the pill to anyone who really shouldn't be pregnant.</comment>

<comment>The pill has been around since the '60s. It's minimal issues are well known. Plan B which is a higher dosage of the same hormones has been OTC for a good five years without issue. http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ob...Doctors who specialize in this have no problem with it being OTC.You realize your obsession with gold standard or nothing argues for not having condoms right? Your entire argument is based on paternalism not medicine.</comment>

<comment>Where did condoms come into the discussion? They are already OTC.</comment>

<comment>You argued against OTC birth control pills because they are susceptible to user end error. Condoms have the same user end error potential. Why is one fine but the other is not?</comment>

<comment>Well, a condom never resulted in an embolus. Not that I know of, anyway.</comment>

<comment>Neither does the pill used properly. People can read instructions. The government doesn't exist to be your nanny.</comment>

<comment>As a matter of fact, yes they do.</comment>

<comment>Not is used properly. We're talking about something that is safe. </comment>

<comment>Yes, if used properly. They are HORMONES. Not Skittles.</comment>

<comment>Every drug has to be used properly. The pill is not special.</comment>

<comment>The pill has risks, even when used properly.</comment>

<comment>No more than anything else OTC.</comment>

<comment>If a woman wants to have an abortion and ensure that she cannot inherit the Kingdom of Heaven, that is certainly her right. Christians are too weak politically to protect the pagans from all their bad choices. They will have to learn the hard way, I suppose.</comment>

<comment>It's MAGIC!</comment>

<comment>Is the author suggesting Scalia was going to vote in favor of abortion clinics and against "religious freedom" plaintiffs opposed to contraception? Scalia was THE quintesential conservative justice. How was HE the last line of  defense for abortion and contraception rights?</comment>

<comment>Wow, an emotional topic, but here goes. Fact ....... the best methood for reducing abortions is large scale availability and support for birth control.  The abortion rate did not increase significantly when they became legal, but the locations changed from back alleys to safe clinics. The Texas legislature's own research arm projected 20,000 more unwanted pregnancies and more abotions as a result of the law closing Planned Parenthood clinics. I feel so strongly about this that I live in Oregon and send contributions to PP, Texas!</comment>

<comment>Amongother things, the need to repeat a number of fundamental facts aboutabortion that many, many do not know.     First,the Supreme “Court” didn't “legalize” abortion in 1973, they“legalized” “abortion on demand”.  Before 1973 women werepermitted abortions!  But they had to be for compelling reasons,including the life of the mother; rape or abortion; deformation ofthe fetus; even whether the mother could handle a child right now. In 1973, they authorized permitting abortions without compellingreasons, which meant any whim would be sufficient.  Girls betting tosee who would get pregnant first, then killing the fetus to avoidbeing inconvenienced; a girl having an argument with her boyfriendand murdering his baby to spite him; women contracting with anabortionist to get pregnant, wait a few months, then let theabortionist kill the fetus and harvest it for cord blood, stem cellsand fetal tissue.  Based on the circumstances, then, it is abortionby craven whim.  But the pro abortion by craven whim forces pretendthat, if abortion by craven whim is not perpetuated, and the trafficin fetal body parts facilitated, then all abortion would be madeillegal.  And that is a lie.  But lies come easily to Liberal partytrash, who are supporters of abortion by craven whim.     Thedeceit is obvious in the signs in the picture at the top of thearticle.  "Keep Abortion Legal", one says.  There is nothreat to abortion!  The issue is the trafficking in fetal body partsin abortion by craven whim!  Situations that meet the standard ofr acompelling reason will still be permitted.  Another sign says,"Abortion On Deman & Without Apology".  "Noapology" was a talking point for Mitt Romney when he was runningfor president.  It was known at that time what it meant.  The U.S.ruinning rampant across the world, destroying lives wherever wasadvabntageous for us and not being bound by any requirements even toadmit we were wrong.  "No apologies" is a characteristictenet for someone who knows they are going to engage in depravity andharm others.  Decent people are always willing to assess theiractions, the malignant think that following their own craven, selfcentered whims can never be qwrong.  And  incidentally, notice thesign by Planned Parenthood saying, "Don't Take Away Our Care". The proposal to end government funding of Planned Parenthood wasbased on their facilitating abortion by craven whim.  If they don't,which they claim, then there is no danger to the funding.  It's onlyif they lie, like all supporters of abortion by craven whim to dosupport what they know is foul, that funding is in danger.     Andthe eminent unscrupulousness concerning abortuaries.  The complaintis that laws threaten store front abortuaries.  The opine isconstantly that women will be denied the right to a safe abortion bycraven whim.  But the issue is far from as simple as the abortion bycraven whim liars claim.  Abortion by craven whim opened the door forlow class and loathsome abortions, the kind whose purpose would be sofoul and malignant that no hospital would have honored it for fear oflosing their reputation.  Abortion by craven whim, then, opened thedoor for permitting and necessitating filthy, untrainedpractitioners, working out of profit first, unsanitary and dangeroussurroundings!  The hideous irony, that those who promoted abortion bycraven whim warned against women having coat hanger abortions in theback of alleys, performed by medical students.  The average storefront abortuary is filthy compared to a back alley!   Inadequateventilation; unsanitary conditions; non existent paperwork, amongother things to try to prevent making a connection between anabortion there and the inevitable development of cancer; untrainedpractitioners.  The laws against abortion by craven whim, whi8ch theLiberal party wants to defeat, want to maintain the junk yardenvironment of store front abortuaries!  They talk about women beingdenied abortions by the new laws.  The new laws are denying themabortions in surroundings that are breeding grounds for disease!  Ifthe store front abortuaries want not to be closed down, why don'tthey provide adequate sanitary conditions?  Because they areintended, under “abortion by demand”, to be solely profitoriented, like all the craven corporate structures Liberal partyleaders invest in.  Also, having conditions filthy increases thelikelihood of women going there dying, and that protects theirtrafficking in fetal tissue from being endangered by testimony ofthose who went through the procedures.</comment>

<comment>Abortion was decriminalized in some situations in some states starting in 1967..before that..it was illegal, period."women contracting with an abortionist to get pregnant, wait a few months, then let theabortionist kill the fetus and harvest it for cord blood, stem cells and fetal tissue"That's illegal.So..not off to a great start.Just quick hint though? When you copy paste a giant wall of text..check the formatting. It's pretty obvious.</comment>

<comment>Abortion as a technique was knownfor a long time.  They supposedly wouldn't have been able to devisethe techniques unless it was practiced.  And, yes, in cases of athreat to the life of the mother, severe deformation to the child,and so on, it was permitted.  But it had to be in approved andcontrolled conditions, in a hospital.  Practicing it in the street,or a filthy warehouse, with no bookkeeping was illegal.  Carrying itout in a clean hospital, which kept records, was accepted.     And there are no realproscriptions against trafficking in fetal body parts.  As long asthe receiving party is willing to make sure no contagion breaks outand accept whatever they receive, there is no real problem.  Thereare stories of fetuses left in dumpsters behind abortuaries.  Thereare no measures taken to prevent this, so, evidently, the moving offetal tissue without special protection is not particularlydisturbing to “government”.  Trafficking in parts obtained by alegal process, parts of something considered by the “law” asnothing more than a hamster, is not prohibited.</comment>

<comment>You often hear these words from some of those on the right 'Keep the government out of my business'. Well women want the government kept out of theirs. It's as simple as that. Of course Republicans don't adhere to that notion because that's when they LOVE the government. Government is convenient for them when it suits their agenda. When it comes to pro-choice that's when the government they usually hate must step in and put a stop to these action by women!</comment>

<comment>Of course, it is NOT that simple.  At some point along the pregnancy there is a second living human inside of the woman.  That makes it not just "her business."</comment>

<comment>Well it most certainly isn't yours. It's her body and certainly not any government official or religious leaders place to tell her what she should do with it.  We hear about gun rights being infringed upon but when it comes to women's rights being infringed upon silence is golden! Her rights can be stripped away because some don't approve.  Millions don't approve of guns being so easy to obtain but the gun lovers will fight tooth and nail to keep those. It's sheer hypocrisy!</comment>

<comment>Try to follow my actual argument and respond to that.  Thanks.</comment>

<comment>At the end of the day it is still HER body and no one has the right to shove their demands down her throat. Seeing as we talking about life where were the pro-life groups when 20 children were slaughtered at Sandy Hook? Didn't see them out with their pro-life signs making a stand against guns seeing as 20 precious souls were taken by them! Or is it only the unborn that they care for?</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I didn't realize you were crazy. Have a good day.</comment>

<comment>I notice you didn't want to address the gun issue!  That involved children! That speaks volumes. Only the unborn do seem to matter then.</comment>

<comment>No.  You are unable to follow a basic line of reasoning.  You bring up irrelevancies that have nothing to do with the issue.  You are, quite simply, unable to carry on a conversation.,</comment>

<comment>A life is a life isn't it? You only want to discuss  the unborn. I want to discuss those already born as well whose lives were taken away violently by a gun. If pro-life groups can protest outside abortion clinics to protect lives then surely to God they can protest outside the NRA to protect the same. As I said I've never seen any of them protesting outside the NRA. If children lives are so valuable then the one's already born should have a voice as well not only those who are still in the womb. I told you my opinion on a woman's right to choose. I still await yours on pro-life groups not standing up for those already born.</comment>

<comment>I am pro choice, but anti-Roe.I get attacked by both sides! Sad.</comment>

<comment>Sorry to hear it Dennis, this is an ugly debate. </comment>

<comment>Happy Saturday! It's great here.  Such a beautiful day.  It must be over 70 degrees :)</comment>

<comment>That's wonderful Ruth, winter is slowly on its way out.. A sultry 51 degrees or so on my end. I hope you're having a great day! :)</comment>

<comment>I am Thank you.  I washed my jeep, shot my gun, did some errands and grilled out. I hope the same for you! </comment>

<comment>Sounds like a day in paradise. :-)Chilling with my family today, everyone is in turtle mode it seems. </comment>

<comment>So who's forcing you to have an abortion?</comment>

<comment>It makes me sick that religious males still insist on controlling the gonads of females.  I'm all for refusing to provide welfare for females who get pregnant, but the whole idea that females' organs should be legislated upon by males, makes me sick to my stomach.  It's got to stop.  It's one of the reasons I was liberal for so long.I think a fair trade of rules should be made.  If males insist on legislating female gonads, females should have the right to pass legislation upon male gonads as well, including their sperm.</comment>

<comment>Whoever gave women the right to kill their babies in the first place? God sure didn't since He considers our bodies His Holy Temple. When women abort their babies, they are committing murder in God's Holy Temple.</comment>
