<comment>This Republican party is paying for the sins of it’s destructive foreign policy and economic blunders that raped the Middle Class and destroyed any integrity we have as a nation abroad. They promoted cheap labor as a virtue. They told us that greed was “good”. They taught us to ignore the reality of our continued festering social wounds and racist attitudes because hey “we’re all making money”. They got into bed with Religious fanatics and convinced millions of Evangelical Christians that they were on their side and that to meddle in politics was "Godly". They allowed a fat, overstuffed, drug addicted, doctor shopping, cigar chomping monster with a big fat mouth named Rush Limbaugh and his pals to call the shots.To add insult to injury they now want to shove a trust fund brat who never worked an honest day in his life and whose father was a notorious racist and slum lord down our throats.Rot in the hell of your own making Republican party.</comment>

<comment>We'll check back with you Nov. Have you seen what the Democrats look like lately? </comment>

<comment>Speaking as a Republican, it's the nomination of Trump *itself* that will be the hell of which Jefferson_Lebowski speaks; that makes November a lose-lose proposition. *Either* the Dems beat us, or we get Trump as president. There's no upside here.</comment>

<comment>Just wondering who's been in the WH for the last 7 years.</comment>

<comment>Reagan democrats....</comment>

<comment>A horrible Republican administration, obviously, that obeys the commands of Rush Limbaugh. No wonder everything is so screwed up, right?</comment>

<comment>Yeah there's one. Sorry, I keep forgetting about those Republicans that have some sanity because they polli in the single digits. But I would have him over many of the other candidates.</comment>

<comment>wow, sucks to be you, sorry you are so angry.   TRUMP rocks TOO.  You only have HC and Bernie, how sad. ALL politicians suck, especially HC.</comment>

<comment>Do you really want Trump as President? Seriously dude?Can you say President Clinton, you will be for the next eight years. Take a guess what the Supreme Court will look like in 2020.</comment>

<comment>Every news report is either about attacking Trump or pushing Rubio, yet Trump continues to win.</comment>

<comment>Man's on fire, Nevada is running out of ballots. Highest turnout ever, 50% new caucus-goers. </comment>

<comment>The old media and political establishment are going through the meat grinder known as change. They are existing in a paradigm that is no longer relevant. They are dead men walking. They are a Mike Tyson opponent circa 1988 about 1 minute into the first round after a flurry of headshots have short-circuited the brain. They are knocked out but still on their feet. The canvas awaits.</comment>

<comment>Every pearl-clutching "oh my god no" op-ed by out of touch academics and nervous journalists just ramps up his support more. Every angry or tearful plea to "stop Trump!" just makes us know it's time to make America great again.</comment>

<comment>Yep, Faux News, Rush Limbaugh, Michael Savage et al created this Frankenstein of ignorant, angry conservatism, and now they're dying by it.</comment>

<comment>I would argue that Savage has never been more relevant.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes, of course. Angry conservatism never existed in history before Fox and LImbaugh and will disappear as soon as liberals completely dominate all media outlets.</comment>

<comment>HelloFeds  By Great you mean like the 90s 70s 60s or 50s or 40s or 30s Just what great like when there was slavery, towers fell or Americans dying in Vietnam or Iraq ,segregation Japanese American encampments just which will be great again era?</comment>

<comment>The new media won't question our inconsistent, fraud prone, bankruptcy loving strong men.для Родины!</comment>

<comment>In a nod to Survivor, the castaway game show now in its 31st season, Jeb Bush dropped out of the presidential race joking, "I congratulate my competitors who remain on the island." Not much was made of Bush's analogy at the time but it's worth pausing over the remarkable resemblance between the reality television genre and the televised spectacle of winnowing the Republican field. In addition to the wall-to-wall coverage on offer from the major news networks, both Showcase and CNN are touting real-time documentaries that promise to track the candidates every move on the path to the nomination. Kennedy understood the power of a candidate's "TV appeal" but if there's one candidate today who knows a good dose of drama makes for the best reality television it's Trump. Like Hearst in his day, this new medium and man seem made for each other.</comment>

<comment>"moving up them up " the editing at The Atlantic is horrible, not just this piece of work, just about every time I read something from this, it is riddled with grammatical, and more importantly factual errors. Where are the editors for the The Atlantic?</comment>

<comment>Trump did very well in Iowa. The problem there was 3 fold. 1) Cruz tried to cheat Carson out of votes and succeeded. 2) There were 200,000 people who did not get to vote because they didn't print enough ballots. 3) Voter fraud was reported, proven and is being looked into. If not for these three things Trump would have gotten credit for winning because the votes were there.</comment>

<comment>You know, because you are magic....</comment>

<comment>I thought he was special. So special they even have classes in his honor.</comment>

<comment>TRUMP WINS AGAIN.....I'm not getting tired of winning yet Donny...keep it upTRUMP 2016</comment>

<comment>I'm not tired of Winning but am tired of Socialist Democrats whining.</comment>

<comment>So what states did you win, Fatt?</comment>

<comment>Redheaded Stepchild??? That is just really weird. Is this supposed to be a put down of redheads and stepchildren?Let's think of other strange, sort-of-offensive descriptions for things.</comment>

<comment>You've never heard the expression?</comment>

<comment>No. Haha. I didn't know that was an expression. That is really odd.</comment>

<comment>Donald Hitler is going to win "Huuuge" and then Clinton is going to kick his fat, bald butt back to NYC, where he will whine some more about Mexicans, Muslims and other entities beginning with the letter "M".</comment>

<comment>Nah, once back in NYC he'll be friendly with Muslims and Mexicans. He needs their money and labor to build and staff his hotels.</comment>

<comment>"...where he will whine some more about Mexicans, Muslims and other entities beginning with the letter "M"."___Including the 'Muricans who didn't vote for him?</comment>

<comment>Trump supporters showed up in Klan gear at the caucuses tonight.  True story.http://www.nationalreview.com/...</comment>

<comment>No prohibition that I know of for campaign paraphernalia at caucus sites.</comment>

<comment>Is Klan gear now officially Trump paraphernalia?  Seems a little premature.</comment>

<comment>So the T.Rump supporters are having trouble tallying up the votes...yeah counting is a higher math skill for some.  Typical for the faux conservatives that support the candidate who is the most uniquely unqualified individual in the race. Sure we want an outsider but not someone who is outside their natural mind. #dumpTRump</comment>

<comment>So Heil Trump is apparently a thing now.  https://twitter.com/timkmak/st...</comment>

<comment>Campaigning ie speaking to the audience to encourage them to vote for someone is done at a Caucus so wearing candidate items is not unusual</comment>

<comment>Just a little unusual that the people counting the votes, checking IDs are actually wearing his gear.</comment>

<comment>The Caucus I chaired some of the people who counted ballots were reps for campaigns and they all counted together LOL as for checking IDs?  they should have the voting lists there and if you aren't on the list here in Iowa then you have to sit down and fill out a registration form done deal</comment>

<comment>Thing is this a a Caucus not a primary things are different</comment>

<comment>get your predictions in before the results come out http://www.presidentialelectio...</comment>

<comment>Based on the reports, I think Trump gets 105% of the eligible vote.</comment>

<comment>Waiting for the post, post, reports...</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump hospitalized with attack of consciencehttp://www.god.com/trump_succu...</comment>

<comment>I voted in the caucus and it was totally disorganized.  The precinct captain barely checked my ID. I actually asked if he needed to see it, and he said he saw it on the table when I signed in.  Seriously, it's harder to buy beer.  I also could have taken more than one ballot if I wanted, easily. Or removed someone else's ballot from the envelope.  I did none of these things.  I dont care how few caucuses there have been, voting is not rocket science. Get it together, Nevada!</comment>

<comment>That's alright if you didn't vote for Trump, they aren't going to count it anyway.</comment>

<comment>Maybe Trump's "associates" are trying to make things easier for him (touches nose).</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but on the plus side, the GOP finally found evidence of voter fraud!In all seriousness, you are to be commended for your integrity.  I do hope the Nevada GOP will work to get things right by 2016.</comment>

<comment>Well the GOP has finally found (or rather, created) voter fraud!</comment>

<comment>They're just making elections great again.</comment>

<comment>I bet a lot of "great deals" are being made behind closed doors.</comment>

<comment>Republicans should smarten up and start taking Nevada seriously. It is a state that reveals a lot of their general election weaknesses. If Republicans insist on constantly retreating to their Southern-oriented comfort zone then thats all they'll be left with. They've lost Colorado two elections in a row, they're losing ground in Arizona, New Mexico and Nevada are becoming lost causes as opposed to swing states. The West used to be fertile ground for Republicans and increasingly its turning to purple if not blue.If Republicans don't wake up and start addressing their negative image among Hispanics, soon enough they'll have to start fighting for Texas and the Republicans will be in deep $#!T. Treating Nevada like some party they feel obligated to attend for a few minutes before splitting early is indicative of where the Republican Party's head has been lately. Up their collective @$$.</comment>

<comment>The Hispanics love Trump or haven't you heard?</comment>

<comment>Yeah but if the Republicans keep gaining votes among working class whites, they could flip states like Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, which have a lot more electoral votes than the states they would lose in the West. I'm not saying it's a good thing, but minorities are, well, a minority, plus they are geographically concentrated and have lower turnout, so they have much less political power than whites.</comment>

<comment>Republicans aren't gaining votes. They've lost OH, WI, MI and PA several elections in a row. Add to that VA, CO and NV. Soon to be joined by AZ, GA and NC. Only if they put up moderate candidates like Sandoval or even Kasich do they have a chance in those states now.</comment>

<comment>Meh, you're underestimating Trump's variance.  If he gets the nomination, Trump could win 55% in Ohio, he could win 40%, depending on how things play out from here.</comment>

<comment>Trump got 45% in Nevada. Next was Rubio at 23%.</comment>

<comment>You wrote this comment at 8:50pm. The votes haven't even been counted yet. The rig is in!</comment>

<comment>Fox is on it- exit polls are amazing for demographics. </comment>

<comment>lol, FAUX.</comment>

<comment>Much of the US Southwest has turned in to a Banana Republic thanks to lax immigration enforcement.  So. Cal. is ridiculous.  It's gone from "oh-ha-ha- we're-illegal-and-we-do-the-jobs-nobody-wants-to-do" to "we-just-annexed- 20%-of-your-country, yankee-suckers."No joke:  "Cheap labor" has morphed in to "stealth annexation."</comment>

<comment>Great! Can be build a wall around Texas already? Who needs them.</comment>

<comment>Seriously, I think I'm going to round up 10 million anglos and we'll all move to Russia under the guise of "cheap labor."  Then   we'll -- by virtue of our presence and prodigious breeding -- proceed to stealthily annex most of western Russia and achieve what Napoleon and Hitler failed to do.Thanks for the how-to on that, illegals lol.   </comment>

<comment>You. You said the whole SW was a no-go-zone, so we might as well cut the cord.</comment>

<comment>You see where I said, "much of,"  not "the whole," right?</comment>

<comment>Anglos can't compete with third world economic refugees. Seems like the idea they could annex anything but a cheeseburger & an iPhone is laughable.</comment>

<comment>Lol -- what are you saying, that third world economic refugees are converging on Russia in some showdown with my fantastic Anglo mob lol?   Go away with your iPhone, cheeseburger, and mustache lol.  </comment>

<comment>No, I'm not saying that, try again. Although judging from your previous comments, we could be here all night.</comment>

<comment>Buh bye.  Thank you for the introspection lol</comment>

<comment>Running out of ballots, Trumpster Fire is... on fire.</comment>

<comment>That's what happens when everyone votes 20 times.</comment>

<comment>I am shocked, shocked I tell you, to hear reports of Trump supporters casting multiple ballots.  They seem so genuinely concerned about illegal activity.</comment>

<comment>I love the reaction by the Nevada Republican party - nothing to see here, move along.   This is some Tammany Hall style rigging.   Boss Tweed would be proud.</comment>

<comment>Now Jeb can do as common people do and use the mute button to avoid unpleasantries on live media.</comment>

<comment>Look at which subsets of the GOP are backing Trump-  http://politicsthatwork.com/bl...</comment>

<comment>Summarize it</comment>

<comment>For example, Republicans without a high school diploma are about twice as likely to vote for Trump as Republicans with a college degree.  It goes through a lot of categories- income, age, race, gender, etc.</comment>

<comment>A lot of lower-income people (aka the working poor) don't have four year degrees, nothing wrong with that.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure if we condescend to them some more and point and laugh they'll appreciate us and change their minds.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, we love being called 'bitter clingers,' lol.</comment>

<comment>Voter fraud by Trump supporters is rampant here.  They are wearing their hats, voting, and getting back in line.  I saw one Trump Fraud vote 20 times.It is like Afghanistan.</comment>

<comment>I agree, Anita. Afghans are human garbage, like Trump supporters. </comment>

<comment>I'l take Afghans over trump supporters anyday! At least they make good rugs.</comment>

<comment>Wat I thought Trump supporters were supposed to be the racists.</comment>

<comment>Trump 2016 -- it's okay to vote again! (and again and again...)</comment>

<comment>They're running out of ballots. High turnout.</comment>

<comment>Yes, turnout might reach a record 1.5% of the state population.  That's counting multiple times each person that voted multiple times.</comment>

<comment>What was Saturday's?</comment>

<comment>About 15% of South Carolina's population.  South Carolina intelligently has a primary, while Nevada insists on keeping its circus caucus.</comment>

<comment>I agree that cockuses suck. </comment>

<comment>Where is all the "voter ID" fraud Republicans have been whining and heavy breathing about?</comment>

<comment>In Nevada, a Make America Great hat is an acceptable form of ID.</comment>

<comment>Grate? Merk 'merka grate" ??USA! USA?</comment>

<comment>At least Jeb! married well.</comment>

<comment>Scalia smothered with a pillow and a plush toy but no one cares.</comment>

<comment>Funny how they're going by Biden's own advice and not going along with a nomination during an election year.</comment>

<comment>Both Scalia and Kennedy received votes after Biden's advice.</comment>

<comment>You misunderstood the whole Biden thing. You should sue Briebart.</comment>

<comment>I'm not very intelligent</comment>

<comment>Don't feel bad; many Americans are stupid too. Look at all those Trump supporters.</comment>

<comment>Scalia died of auto-erotic asphyxiationhttp://dailycaller.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>Why was he on this super-secret "hunting" trip with a 24 year old male page?</comment>

<comment>It's a disaster and it's only 8:30 PM! The night is still young folks!The Irony of Republicans being caught committing massive voter and electoral fraud should not be lost on all here.</comment>

<comment>Is it too late for the Cruz campaign to issue some lie or do some dirty trick???</comment>

<comment>Cruz reported that Ben Carson had died last night and Rubio is dropping out tomorrow.</comment>

<comment>Non Trump votes go in the special ballot box that looks like a garbage can.</comment>

<comment>So they have a garbage can that looks like a bald, obese guy in a tent suit?That's so cool.</comment>

<comment>I see some people are complaining about not checking for ID's.  I thought checking for ID's was bad.</comment>

<comment>It's funny when Republican hypocrisy is revealed. I guess if you're old and white, no need for ID!</comment>

<comment>Yo man, ID's are racist.</comment>

<comment>Don't you see, voter fraud is not possible. </comment>

<comment>They just proved voter fraud exists!!  Now we need voter IDs throughout the country, but only for general elections.  And keep the polls open less so the fraudsters have less opportunity to do their nefarious deeds.Trump 2016 - Make America vote again ... and again ... and again</comment>

<comment>Yeah, polls should only be open for thirty seconds. Make America Rape Again.</comment>

<comment>Trump gets 41% of the Hispanic vote in Nevada. Good for them for getting the big picture! </comment>

<comment>...in your telenova dreams</comment>

<comment>Yeah just saw it. It's called Facts being reported on the news.</comment>

<comment>Faux Newz? Who believes them?</comment>

<comment>They hate Trump. It's prob stronger than what they are reporting. </comment>

<comment>Yeah, my daughter has that game too.</comment>

<comment>You have a child? omg</comment>

<comment>Don't start whining again. Sorry no one wanted you or found you desirable. Maybe take some responsibility for being an arsehole.</comment>

<comment>Not even remotely accurate. Sorry :(</comment>

<comment>So you are STILL whining? That you are "misunderstood"?Puleeze don't play that right wing "victim" card yet again.</comment>

<comment>41% of the Hispanic vote among Republican caucus-goers.  9% of those voters are Latino.  41% of 9% of the votes cast is about 2,750 votes, call it 2,800 for ease of math.  There are 330,000 eligible Latino voters in Nevada, meaning that .08% of Nevada's Latino population turned out to vote for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Idc- a win is a win. Perception matters. He just needs some of them. </comment>

<comment>Well, yeah.  I'm sure he'll get some of nearly every demographic group.</comment>

<comment>The Clinton plan to get the obese, bald guy in the tent suit nominated is shaping up very, very well.Will be amusing when she cuts his balls off on live tv.</comment>

<comment>Obese - not at allBald- not at allTrump's got momentum on his side! Next SEC!</comment>

<comment>Wow, you are blind as well as stupid? You must be a Trump supporter!</comment>

<comment>You are a broken record, spouting the same lines every night.....yawn </comment>

<comment>Don't whine sweetie, it only makes you look more stupid.</comment>

<comment>Boo hoo- do you feel better now? Cya </comment>

<comment>Don't whine to me – I think it is disgusting and idiotic that you people whine so much.</comment>

<comment>GOP coalescing around trump.Killary is in deep poop!</comment>

<comment>Will love it when the GOP nominates a combover for its Presidential candidate?That would be so fitting.</comment>

<comment>Your old bag of blood clots is tanking.</comment>

<comment>Explain the combover. Please.</comment>

<comment>Americans are actually not metrosexuals overall. We DGAF about a man's hair. We just want him to MAGA</comment>

<comment>It's Pat!</comment>

<comment>Combovers like Trump's are not so bad... but his tent suits are horrible. Why can't he just acknowledge that he has a weight problem? Or a bald problem?Feet of clay too? No doubt.</comment>

<comment>Pant suits, tent suits... they're all old and fat.</comment>

<comment>Yes but Trump is balder and fatter, and like most bullies, he overcompensates for it.</comment>

<comment>I kind of like the aѕѕhole-ishness. If I was Dictator of the United States, I'd be such an aѕѕhole on the world stage. The curse words would be countless when discussing foreign policy.</comment>

<comment>Let him be ambassador to the Kingdom of FuckAll. He couldn't screw that up</comment>

<comment>Actually I'm picturing Ben Carson in that role ...</comment>

<comment>Comb-overs like Trump's can cause problems with bar code readers.</comment>

<comment>Why so obsessed with people's appearance, catlady? I thought progressives weren't interested in those things?</comment>

<comment>It's official - Trump wins!! Here come more angry insults! </comment>

<comment>It's totally Clinton's plan. Trump will be so easy to knock off.</comment>

<comment>He will destroy her with her own past. It's going to get good soon when the media can't hide her anymore.Now after his Cruz attack, he's 10/10 in attacks and wins.Hispanics - he was 41%!</comment>

<comment>Ha ha. Like most sad whiners, you don't have a clue and are always looking for your "hero". How has that worked out for you so far? How many divorces...Clinton will cut his nuts off and sauté them in butter.</comment>

<comment>You're fixated on castration. Do you have a craving for testicles? I got your fix right here, sweetie.</comment>

<comment>That's your kink and you see it in the world.Sorry, not interested. Not judging but seriously not interested.But have fun with that (maybe get a first aid kit)</comment>

<comment>Clinton's toast. People are waiting for a more dynamic candidate that can prove he wins. 41% Hispanic vote is huge.Divorce? Ha NO</comment>

<comment>Stop with your incessant whining. Go feed your cats.</comment>

<comment>Trump will make sure Hillary is incarcerated. She is a big fan of mass incarceration after all.</comment>

<comment>Haha Trump 42%. The Republican party is about to kill itself.</comment>

<comment>Yep.   If he wins the nomination, the second worst thing that could happen to the Republican party is him losing in the general election.</comment>

<comment>...or winning.Thank Ben Carson's God puppet that that is not going to happen.</comment>

<comment>No him actually winning a general election would be the worse thing to ever happen to Republicans.  There wouldn't be a Republican party after a Trump presidency.</comment>

<comment>That's the point LMAO</comment>

<comment>Part of me would like to see him win, just for the car-crash value. But then we all have to live here.</comment>

<comment>Yeah you'd have to guarantee me that the country would survive a Trump presidency before I'd make that deal.</comment>

<comment>It's going to be Great Again.</comment>

<comment>Here's a clue: Look at how the stock market performs the day after a Trump win, vs. how it does after Bernie performs well.</comment>

<comment>Bush killed the Republican party. Trump is creating something new, they haven't thought of a catchy name for it yet.</comment>

<comment>No one wants those establishment aѕѕholes. They've fuсked over average people for too many years. Go Sanders and Trump!</comment>

<comment>Jon Ralston is incorrect. The ballots did not say "Printing generously donated by Fiore..." That was on the sheet you got if you wanted to be a Republican delegate and pay the $40 for the next convention. The ballots don't have that endorsement--the caucus was a mess (there were SO many people), but that ballot talk above is just false!</comment>

<comment>Politics?</comment>

<comment>Trump's promises.</comment>

<comment>Of course, just like Senator Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is promising specific policies.  Trump is promising to Make America Great Again which means whatever the voters want it to mean.   If you're a white supremacist, it means you're going back to the good old days.  If you're an anti-PC crowd, it means you can go back to a Mad Men culture in the office.  If you're a factory worker, it means we'll stop trading with China and all those jobs are coming back.  If you think other countries should fear America, it means other countries will fear America just because Trump threatens them.  It's all nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, if I was more sober, I'd rebuttal you really good (dude, it's late, got work tomorrow). But, I gotta ask, how do we get free college, health care, bus passes, and rent with just a vote?I like Bernie, and I'll vote for him, but only because he seems to care about all Americans. His pledges, however, are nonsense. </comment>

<comment>when i watch this spectacle, i keep waiting for a sign to drop down from above the camera with the word "laugh" written on it (the way that they used to do on live tv comedy shows in the 1950's) to let people know when when viewers should start laughing. for the last 3 cycles (ever since barack obama came to prominence) the republican primaries have been reality tv.</comment>

<comment>Palin, Trump and Bauchman recounting how she got a vaccination and suffered mental retardation as a result.</comment>

<comment>So Trump stumbles into the kitchen, late at night, looking for some cold pizza, he flips on the light, and see's two huge ugly roaches on the floor, with no further ado, he stomps on both Rubio and Cruz, crushing the vermin utterly, then turns out the lights, and goes back to bed,sleeping soundly and thus endeth the Nevada Caucuses...</comment>

<comment>Mexico could pay for the wall by tariffs on their products. I'll miss cheap Mexican soda and piñatas, but thems the breaks. </comment>

<comment>you've obviously never heard of something called NAFTA...</comment>

<comment>Nullify it. Arbitrary words and policy, nothing more.</comment>

<comment>Trump literally just said "we're going to bring in so much money and so much everything, we're going to make America great again."  So much everything?</comment>

<comment>trump's victory speech sounds like an opening monologue for "saturday night live"; i thought it was hilarious. i was waiting for him to end the speech by saying: "live from new york..."</comment>

<comment>I want the tshirt rights. Trump: So much everything!</comment>

<comment>Everything just gets in the way.  I can't even fathom so much everything.</comment>

<comment>Trump, making fascism great again. LOL</comment>

<comment>The parallels between Sanders and Trump are striking. Not fascism, just displeasure. </comment>

<comment>Trump will prob get some of Bernie's voters if Hillary is the nominee. </comment>

<comment>He will. I'm on the fence between the two (Sanders and Trump). Sanders will be excluded by the DNC. I want an anti-establishment candidate. That's why I voted for Senator Obama in 2008. </comment>

<comment>Do you have any money in the stock market -- for instance, in a 401(k), pension or IRA retirement account? If so, you had better hope that Sanders doesn't win, because he is going to tank the economy and take your savings down with him. Make no mistake about this.  (What do you think a 'revolution' looks like?)The only people who should vote for Sanders are the ones who have nothing, hence nothing to lose, and who might be the recipient of some government goodies if he wins. If you're a working person, or one who has amassed any wealth (even modest) under the current system, you'd best steer clear of Sanders, IMO.</comment>

<comment>I'd vote for him over Trump (who somehow managed to fail to sell football in America and also managed to bankrupt a casino (?))</comment>

<comment>Ignoring, of course, his many successful enterprises. (Hint: if you launch enough businesses, some are bound to fail.) How many businesses has Sanders started? What enterprises has he managed successfully?</comment>

<comment>Rubio is  a bad example. I'm not sure of anything that he's managed to see to completion.Cruz does have a record of accomplishment but what he's actually done is terrifying.</comment>

<comment>Trump's speech was funny and awesome! Hispanic vote now at 46%. Total: 47% Trump, 23% Rubio is next. So much for the media saying Rubio gets all of Jeb's voters.And Media...Trump got Establishment, Moderate, Evangelical, Educated voters, but said he really really appreciates the Uneducated Voters! He loves that group - No smugness in this billionaire. They said they love their Uncle Donny!</comment>

<comment>I hope Trumpies aren't thinking the GOP Hispanic vote exit poll result has any bearing on what a general election would look like.....wait, actually I hope they do.</comment>

<comment>Idk - I'm just hoping he can win enough. Hillary is not pulling as many as she thought. Trump has the unknown factor. He's versatile with his campaign style. He might think of something we don't know about to bring over more minorities. Exciting campaign for us all to follow- historical. </comment>

<comment>I have worked side-by-side with lots of Mexicans over the years, and the ones I've known have been hard-working people. As such, it doesn't surprise me that they might find the idea of a stronger economy with more opportunities appealing. Not everyone is a progressive weakling who just wants the government to give them more stuff, you know!</comment>

<comment>If Cruz drops out within next week, Rubio will be the GOP nominee.  If Cruz does not, Trump will probably be the nominee.</comment>

<comment>Trump gets a lot of Cruz's Outsider vote. Anti-Establishment. Cruz's ego will not allow him to drop out this soon. </comment>

<comment>I would not say most, but yes, they will be up for grabs.  While not exactly happy with GOP, Cruz's supporters tend to be more conventionally conservative and many may be drawn to Rubio.  Basically, if Republicans can get half of Cruz's supporters to Rubio, more or less, (I think they can pull this off and primaries after 3/1 are mostly winner take all), then they stop Trump.  If not, Trump wins.</comment>

<comment>Trump is getting almost all SEC. I just don't see a path for Rubio unless Trump does something really really bad. Interesting to watch. </comment>

<comment>What makes you think Rubio has what it takes to be president? What is there in his background or accomplishments to date that suggest he is qualified to lead this country in these troubled times?</comment>

<comment>I did not say he would be the president.  I did say that he would be the most likely Republican nominee.  As far as I can tell, demographics make it nearly impossible for any Republican nominee other than Trump to win in November.  Still, enough Republicans don't want to see Trump as their nominee and I see them making one big push over next week (that just might succeed) to unify behind one of their own to thwart both Trump and Cruz, and the only one they have left is Rubio.</comment>

<comment>I think Trump still eventually has his meltdown moment, but he manages to stay in the news as Cruz and Rubio fight for his delegates before the convention..</comment>

<comment>There's no chance Cruz drops out before Texas votes on Super Tuesday, and with that vote he's bound to amass significantly more delegates than Rubio.  At this point, it will be very surprising if Trump isn't the nominee.</comment>

<comment>Neither are going to fold when they're running neck-and-neck for second place. This, of course, gives Trump a huge advantage as they're splitting the non-Trump vote (and delegates) between them.</comment>

<comment>Angry people voted for the guy who pretends to be angry. What a 3 ring circus the GOP is these days.</comment>

<comment>Angry stupid people voting for the angry stupid candidate.</comment>

<comment>Trump isn't stupid, he knows exactly what he's doing, and he's winning.</comment>

<comment>Let's set aside this notion Donald Trump doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing!</comment>

<comment>Yep. I believe it's called "Making America Great Again."</comment>

<comment>That was very funny.</comment>

<comment>The grifter is usually the only one in the room who knows what's going on with respect to the scheme, that doesn't make him intelligent.</comment>

<comment>I forget where I read this but I recall a quote saying that someone like Jeb Bush will say he understands people's anger, and knows why they're angry, and empathizes with their anger. Whereas Donald Trump IS ANGRY.</comment>

<comment>Trump is acting angry, he's a performer....the problem is, the people voting for him are too stupid to realize. After all, Trumps largest constituent are the least educated.</comment>

<comment>As someone who is trying to be a businessman in this country right now, he has every right to be angry.</comment>

<comment>Hare Krishna, Hare Trump.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha, Trump is going to win the nomination isn't he?</comment>

<comment>I think you're going to see some dark money come off the sidelines pretty soon now.</comment>

<comment>Didn't Jeb spend hundreds of millions trying to do that to wind up with like 5 delegates and a legacy now defined by several youtube compilations worth of being owned by a quasi-fascist? I don't know if dark money is gonna cut it this time.</comment>

<comment>I think that a non affiliated Superpac will be formed for the express purpose of knocking down Trump.</comment>

<comment>When Trump points this out it will only reinforce him with the voters.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, but that's good, because the more money is wasted on those two clowns (Rubio and Cruz) fighting amongst eachother, the more Trump can batter on Hillary, who should be indicted, not be running for President.</comment>

<comment>Did I hear that right: In a race featuring five candidates in Nevada, Trump won 45% of the Latino vote? Wow.</comment>

<comment>Yeah 45% of the Latino vote that actually shows up for a Republican caucus.</comment>

<comment>A Republican caucus for sure, but it still surprised me.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, basically he carried the Clark county Sheriffs and Nevada State Police....</comment>

<comment>silly journalists...America is "For Sale", who else has the caja to buy it up? Why the perfect trifecta of Greed, Misogyny, Ego, and proof? "Made in America" incontrovertible evidence, we are sick society.</comment>

<comment>Funny that you're standing up for Megyn Kelly so hard now when if it hadn't been for her getting treated equally and being insulted like a man would have been, you'd be decrying her existience as she's a Fox News shill, right?</comment>

<comment>This comment is awaiting moderation. Show comment.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the tip.</comment>

<comment>News reports that Trump has won the great majority of the Hispanic vote in Nevada.  And, that John Wayne Gacy has just won the adolescent male vote.  Love is blind, deaf and dumb.</comment>

<comment>Not everybody shares your love of John Wayne Gacy.</comment>

<comment>John Wayne Gacy didn't get any votes... what sort of crack rock have you been smoking?</comment>

<comment>Christ that's a stupid thing to say.</comment>

<comment>What you wrote? Yes, absolutely cretinuous.</comment>

<comment>IF Trump wins the GOP nomination I wonder if Rand Paul would run as a Libertarian??</comment>

<comment>I like Paul, but its to late.We're moving on.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if Ted Cruz would run as an independent of some sort.I think he's narcissistic enough that he would consider a political equivalent of a Samson Option.</comment>

<comment>He would get my vote.  Rand is always the best defender of the Bill of Rights.</comment>

<comment>If he tried to spoil the GOP nominee - that would not be good for his career.</comment>

<comment>IF Trump is the GOP nominee, the Senate is gone!</comment>

<comment>WTF?</comment>

<comment>Repubs aren't that strong in the Senate to survive a weak ticket. A Clinton landslide would surely put the Dems in charge of the Senate!</comment>

<comment>Now you are in cloud-cuckoo land.</comment>

<comment>That Lib-cuck has cucked too much in Detroit to try to ensure that no one can possibly call him a racist (as if people saying that was a legimate insult in this day and age... I'd frankly be suspicious of anyone who isn't being called a racist!).</comment>

<comment>He doesn't have presidential hair. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>If? It's all but certain at this point.And Rand... I like him, but I liked and do like his dad more.We've moved on.</comment>

<comment>Its anything but certain, I still think Trump will be at the convention negotiating with Cruz and Rubio for his delegates....</comment>

<comment>As long as the disruption continues.</comment>

<comment>http://www.270towin.com/maps/b...If elections were by pop vote Trump has chance but we go by EC so Hillary wins in landslide. EC protects from ignorance and one party system so Trump has zero chance in November.</comment>

<comment>Whats EC prey tell?</comment>

<comment>Electoral college?</comment>

<comment>The only problem with that distinctly non-partisan site is that it assumes far too many states which have gone to the Republican party nominee more than 75% of the time since 1952 to be swing states.There is no black man running for office this year for people to give their non-racist votes too because if you didn't vote for a black man, you would in fact definitely be a racist, bigoted KKK Nazi, and probably quite literally Adolf Hitler himself.</comment>

<comment>Trump is stalled at 1/3 of the GOP primary voters. 2/3 want someone better. They just can't agree on who that is.Can't see Hillary losing. Wish there was hope.</comment>

<comment>"Can't see.."</comment>

<comment>She wants some more "hope". Obama didn't give her enough. Needs to get it good and hard from Hillary too!</comment>

<comment>1. I wasn't aware that 45.9% is only a third of the total. I guess my knowledge of fractions is completely wrong. I should go and burn my mathematics degree now.2. You are operating on the false implication that people who vote in primaries represent the whole potential electoral base, and double down with the further false premise that if some percentage, let's call it X, vote for Trump, and Y and Z percent of the primary voters vote for two other candidates, that the proportion of people who would definitely not vote for Trump is Y+Z.</comment>

<comment>Maybe your foresight and insight isn't so great - ya ever consider that?</comment>

<comment>Neither is your snark-fu ;-)</comment>

<comment>At least in Nevada, your math is off seeing how Trump received just under half the vote.</comment>

<comment>What a pathetic indictment of conservative America.</comment>

<comment>What have you done for Black people?</comment>

<comment>Good point.</comment>

<comment>This isn't about "conservative" any longer.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the leader the GOP deserve.</comment>

<comment>"...Trump is the leader the GOP  American needs and deserves...".FTFY.</comment>

<comment>46% of hispanic vote went to Trump.  I am not surprised but maybe the press will finally start to wake up??</comment>

<comment>Congratulations to your boy.  He spanked them last night.</comment>

<comment>"Wake-up" to what, exactly? Only two counties in Nevada have significant latino populations. You're basically talking about all the latino cops and sheriff's deputies in Las Vegas and the surrounding counties.Just wanting to set realistic expectations that you won't have this experience in the general election, nationwide, with latino votes.</comment>

<comment>Oh no. I got the police vote?!?!?!?!?!That's horrible.</comment>

<comment>It's not horrible, but it's also not a huge number of people....Sorry... It's not a YUUUUUUUGE number of people.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. You're going to need to spell it with a "y".</comment>

<comment>What percentage of Republican caucus voters in Nevada were Latino?</comment>

<comment>Nine.  The Trumpists are acting as though catching 41% of 9% of Republican caucus-goers is indicative of broad appeal to Latinos.  Then again, they're also acting as though America is falling apart and needs a Berlusconi figure to "make it great again," so...</comment>

<comment>Trump won the hispanic vote versus two hispanics!!</comment>

<comment>Rubio and Cruz are Cubans and most other hispanic groups don't like Cubans (in general, there are certainly exceptions).  Cubans also don't generally consider themselves Hispanics.  Cubans also are not Latino.  Cubans, again in general, have a long history of trying to distinguish themselves from other Hispanic groups and generally like to think of themselves as above the Hispanic groups.</comment>

<comment>Well... he won Hispanics who vote in GOP caucases</comment>

<comment>You are a wise man.  I am learning from you.    I like to see things from an original perspective.</comment>

<comment>the Trump is still superior to anything hillary/bernie has to offer.Lets fold this blade down.Cruz or Rubio?We're ready!</comment>

<comment>Trump is superior to Hillary and Bernie? How?I see no difference. In fact Trump and Bernie see eye-to-eye on most economic issues.</comment>

<comment>Big differences - Trump wants to deport illegals- Bernie cannot do that, since his base forbids it.bernie cannot build a wall.bernie is beholden to fringe lefties such as "Black Lives Matter", affirmative action and most of Obama's agenda.Trump's foreign policy is mainstream Republican - Bernie will just continue the obama/clinton foreign policy.</comment>

<comment>Forgive me, but that's a really stupid thing to say.http://thehill.com/blogs/ballo...Bernie literally wants to use EOs to grant amnesty.Please stop.</comment>

<comment>Learn something:http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/26/...http://www.businessinsider.com...</comment>

<comment>I'm aware of what Bernie's ideas on trade are. I'm also aware of that he's a socialist bat who wants to grant amnesty via Executive Fiat.He's a moron.</comment>

<comment>Then you are a socialist as well since your views are the same.</comment>

<comment>The US presidential election is the best reality TV / sports show / game show on. And what a show it is!!!! No holds barred lying, insults, hyperbole, jingoism, race baiting, nativism, science denying and more. Best of all, as an outlander I get to place wagers on the outcome and not be affected by any of it.</comment>

<comment>Yup - win/win for everyone. Not only is Trump entertaining but he has a great message and great policies. America wins!Dem turnout is WAY DOWN compared to 2008.</comment>

<comment>I am afraid to say it, but I am rooting for The Donald (but don't tell anyone)</comment>

<comment>Finally a true non politician who will help both classes.  Its a once in a life time deal, take it. can't possibly be any worse than the last 2 clowns in office.</comment>

<comment>My advice is to not ever (under even the worst of circumstances) say things can't get any worse. I said that when Bush was installed as President. Even though I was pissed about the outcome, the candidates didn't excite me, so I said "How bad could it possibly be? At least I'll get a tax cut."One 9/11 attack, and two $1+ Trillion wars later and I'm still regretting saying that out loud.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, ditto.I supported Nader because I thought that there wasn't a hairs breadth worth of difference between Bush and Gore. That was Nader's sales pitch.Election night 2000 the Nader supporters at his election party were largely dismayed with the outcome and I was telling each of them, "We've said all along that we weren't going to pick between the lesser of two evils. What did you expect?"Turns out though, they were right and I was wrong. There was plenty of reason to be upset about the prospect of a Bush presidency.</comment>

<comment>Killary voted for those wars.Tell her thanks.</comment>

<comment>Yep, that's why my primary vote is for Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>She is the disease, not the cure.</comment>

<comment>Well, now we know whose fault it was! Thank you very much, Mr. Finglethorpe.</comment>

<comment>"... Entrance polls showed Trump winning across the board, and improbably, even among Hispanics...".Right, because in superficial, patronizing and reductionistic progressiveideology - all Hispanics must be supporters of illegal immigration.God forbid that there might exist some Hispanics who emigrated to the USA precisely to escape countries where nobody cares about obeying the law - in order to find a country that is successful PRECISELY because most people ( except progressives, presumably ) CARE about respecting the law.</comment>

<comment>I have never been a trump supporter, but it is fun to see Americans rejecting the corrupt old establishment.Killary symbolizes everything in government that is old, corrupt, and stale.Seeing trump doing so well with female voters and the bean vote is also fun because it destroys Killary's narrative of trying to shame minorities and crotch voters into supporting her campaign.</comment>

<comment>The first act President Trump should do is deport Cruz and Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Trump will actually be grateful to have them in the Senate.</comment>

<comment>Rubio won't be in the Senate, whichever way this goes.  He's already said he's not running for re-election even if he doesn't get the nomination.</comment>

<comment>One less amnesty supporter.</comment>

<comment>That's kinda harsh. I think Rubio might make a good celebrity apprentice! I doubt anyone would miss Cruz, though, so I guess he can go.</comment>

<comment>But...but...beginning of the end...but...gone too far this time...but...withdraw by December 15...but...but...he said mean things...Bwahahahaha.</comment>

<comment>I've discovered the latest pathetic verbal trick in the progressive media's anti-Trump campaign.Yesterday in the Atlantic - they did the "Trump is calling women disgusting pigs" gambit.Today, I visited Slate and they got the same meme going.  Very crude.So, for example - some female media shark attacks Trump - he fires back "You are a disgusting pig".Then somehow - that translates into "Trump calls (all) women disgusting pigs".Really, progressives?   You take people for being that dumb not to notice your little trick?</comment>

<comment>Really, progressives? You take people for being that dumb not to notice your little trick?=================Yes, the average person is that dumb.  Which is they the left always engages in dirty tricks.</comment>

<comment>Think of how dumb the average person is, and we'll use some of the trolls here to illustrate that: Tyler McGinty, or mw, or Richard Owens for example. Then realize HALF of them? Are dumber than that.Bradan, Unmanageable, Mean Girl.</comment>

<comment>don't forget BoredInMin.</comment>

<comment>Dude has legions of sockpuppets.Insanity.</comment>

<comment>That is a great George Carlin joke!</comment>

<comment>It is so transparent by now, and so ineffective, you'd think that they would try something new.  Like, for instance, debating us on the actual issues facing America?</comment>

<comment>"It's the corruption, stupid."That awkward moment when I can win the presidency without Nevada, Florida, Colorado, or New Mexico...Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>I never though this would happen.</comment>

<comment>Huffington Post has been on point recently.They said that I can win the presidency simply by winning the Rust Belt.Weird, right?I think I win Florida and Nevada and New Mexico also though.And Colorado, are they really going to vote for an old bat?I mean, they'd vote for Bernie, but what's their incentive to vote for Hillary?</comment>

<comment>I still can figure out why anyone would vote for Hillary. If Trump could get her to shriek at a debate, she would be done.No one wants to listen to this for 4 years.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Honestly? I don't think they will. Do you want a scandal plagued administration?What are her qualifications? Aside from being Bill's wife?</comment>

<comment>She did make a mess in Libya.</comment>

<comment>A new poll came out today from New Jersey.   This thing is simply over.  It is over.  Trump has 38% in NJ, but that is not the news.  Cruz has a mere 10% and Rubio 11% there.  The blue state voters have rejected the establishment candidates!  This is the biggest news we have heard from the polls to date.  The GOP establishment HAS NO CANDIDATE.   I would love to see them run a third party candidate.  Who will they run? Someone who can only muster 11% in New Jersey????</comment>

<comment>Massachusetts 50%Florida? 48%Michigan 36%Ohio +5 over KasichNorth Carolina 16-18%It's amazing.</comment>

<comment>In my opinion, Trump is the GOP nominee.</comment>

<comment>You're not wrong.By the way... I'm looking at delegate allocation. Should get at least half, right?</comment>

<comment>Rubio won't go negative.  I think he knows better.</comment>

<comment>He wants to be president. Of course he won't.Rubio can be president at 53 after my second term.</comment>

<comment>I think you and I have been Trump fans for a long time, back when he was dismissed as a joke.</comment>

<comment>Yep, I think we called it first.</comment>

<comment>Well... Us three.</comment>
