<comment>I doubt that Republicans need any help from the Democrats in order to hate each other's guts.Ryan really is a dufus.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.  I mean, I understand that's the normal thing to rally the party (blame the other party for any sort of failure)...but it's so disingenuous here that it makes no sense even in the GOP bubble.  The GOP infighting has happened all on their own, with virtually no help from the dems.  It is entirely of their own making.</comment>

<comment>Love how the Republicans parrot this belief, but take no responsibility for their own intransigence and inability to compromise.</comment>

<comment>Look up the iron law of institutions </comment>

<comment>It's cynical and expedient, but not good enough for the country.</comment>

<comment>No, it ain't. But I do not have much faith in the patriotism of people who wish to trumpet their patriotism for all to see</comment>

<comment>You must not value words terribly highly. I'd pay $200 for that word.</comment>

<comment>I don't have as much use for a word like that as I do for something like sycophant. It's too obscure and specialized </comment>

<comment>Eh...Fair enough. I can see your value proposition. Me, I'm more liberal on my spending on words. I want a potent diction and thus I'm willing to spend heavily on my armamentarium of words.</comment>

<comment>"I'd buy that for a dollar!"</comment>

<comment>at least they finally got around to repealing the ACA, again, in their demented minds maybe, someday, if americans vote to elect a republican reactionary, which they won't</comment>

<comment>The problem is compromise in Washington is Democrats getting more spending in exchange for the Republicans getting some tax cuts and in the end the national debt just keeps climbing.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes true, but the Clinton presidency is a good counter-example.</comment>

<comment>The debt rose every single year Clinton was President.  Notice I said debt, because you can't fake those numbers by shifting costs off budget.http://www.treasurydirect.gov/...http://www.treasurydirect.gov/...The last time the debt decreased year on year was 1957.</comment>

<comment>Ah, that's because there were record levels of SSA contributions which are... parked in treasury bills.The budget was in surplus. </comment>

<comment>Nice try, but Social Security surpluses get spent as general revenue, but because it is an obligation we need to repay in the future it gets added into the debt column.  If we hadn't spent it then the debt would not have increased.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you are just wrong about that. From the totals it is quite clear that they are reporting total Treasury obligations, including intragovernmental obligations - in 2015, for example, they report $18T. Almost $8T of that is intragovernmental, as you can see here: https://www.fiscal.treasury.go... in the Ownership of Federal Securities document. This $8T is carried as surplus by the agency holding the securities, but as debt by the Treasury bc the agency bought securities with the surplus.</comment>

<comment>Allow Politifact to explain to you how Social Security surpluses work.  Incidentally this is also why failing to raise the debt ceiling could have prevented Social Security payments.  If there really was a surplus sitting in a fund somewhere you wouldn't need to borrow money to pay benefits.  But there isn't a surplus, it was spent and replaced with Treasury IOU's."By law, the U.S. Treasury is required to take the surplus and, in exchange, issue interest-accruing bonds to the Social Security trust funds. The Treasury, meanwhile, uses the cash to fund government expenses, though it has to repay the bonds whenever the Social Security commissioner wants to redeem them."http://www.politifact.com/trut...</comment>

<comment>Well, yes, that's how it works.However isn't your post above implying that Clinton did not preside over spending restraint, or even just a budget surplus, because the debt increased?And you've now just described how it's possible for those two conditions to co-exist?And even if it wasn't due to SSA receipts, even a personal household can increase its debt (eg I buy a new house) while actually spending less overall, so the two (spending and debt) can be quite unrelated?There are many cases where it makes sense for both a household and sovereign government to do this.</comment>

<comment>I don't mean to take anything away from Clinton and indeed I commend the government at that time for being the most fiscally responsible we've had in decades.    I am, however, decrying our accounting practices that claim a surplus while our debt increases, which is only possible through accounting trickery.As to your example of a personal household, you've illustrated the precise problem.  You can't say "We earned $60,000 this year and only spent $59,000 and thus have a $1,000 surplus" when you've also purchased a $200,000 house.  That is putting expenses off budget, which is why I only look at the debt numbers.  If the debt rose, you didn't have a surplus, you had accounting tricks.</comment>

<comment>You can't have it both ways, John. Either the surplus exists in the form of the special issue bonds or the debt is not $18T. If the fund is not real, then the debt that it entails is not real either.</comment>

<comment>I'm not trying to have it both ways, I am just trying to make it very clear that the Social Security surplus has already been spent and that all we have in it's place are Treasuries.  For any other entity a Treasury note or bond would be an asset, but because the government is the entity that has to repay those Treasuries it represents a future claims, which is why it is debt.When it comes time to redeem the "Trust Fund" it isn't like they have gold sitting in a vault they can withdraw, they have Treasuries which they redeem and which will have to be paid for either through general revenue, or more likely through additional borrowing.</comment>

<comment>Sure you are. You are not counting the Treasuries as assets to the SSA or other bureaus that hold them, but you were counting them as obligations in your first three posts. That's having it both ways.</comment>

<comment>They ARE obligation.  I'll let Politifact explain to you:"Without considering interest, Social Security has actually been running a deficit over recent years, Gleckman noted. And, when Social Security runs a deficit, the program draws on interest from the Social Security bonds, forcing government officials, already operating at a deficit, to borrow more money from other sources to make up the difference."In other words to actually collect on the Social Security Trust Fund Treasuries the government will have either cover it with money from general revenue or borrow it, because they already spent the surplus.http://www.politifact.com/new-...</comment>

<comment>*sigh*. Maybe before you offer to explain something to someone, you could try to make sure that you actually understand what they are saying. Let's try a counterfactual: suppose the budget were exactly in balance but there was a $1B surplus in Social Security. The government would have to buy bonds with that money, leading to $1B of debt offset by $1B in assets carried by the SSA. So you see, the more surplus revenue the SSA collects, the higher the debt will appear to climb, as Nari224 was saying in his/her OP. If you are going to count this as $1B of debt, you also have to count $1B of surplus. Now, future payments are another matter - presumably the surplus was collected because of some anticipated future need, but technically that is not part of today's accounting.</comment>

<comment>I've made two basic claims.  1.  Social Security "trust fund" assets are Treasuries and thus are debt2.  Social Security occurs off budget.  This is why you can have a budget surplus, but still increase the national debt. http://legislink.org/us/pl-101...</comment>

<comment>But debt as a percentage of GDP fell.  Last time that happened. . . under  Carter.  Hasn't happened in a Republican administration in over 40 yrs.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, when the debt expands over 50% in the course of 5 years I don't give credit for a 3% decrease, because it's still the highest debt level we've had since the 1940's, also under a Democratic president.</comment>

<comment>The debt increased 32% over the 8 years under Clinton.  The size of the economy grew by 35%.  Now, I don't attribute all of an economy under a President to that one person, but you also can't say he did a bad job with it either.</comment>

<comment>I was talking about Obama.</comment>

<comment>You were responding to a post that was clearly about Clinton, and never mentioned Obama in your post.</comment>

<comment>Look at precisely the claims I made:1.  "when the debt expands over 50% in the course of 5 years"2.  "I don't give credit for a 3% decrease"3.  " it's still the highest debt level we've had since the 1940's"The third is the most obvious, since the highest debt level since the 1940's has been under Obama.  Also the first is pretty obviously not Clinton because the debt didn't even expand 50% in Clinton's entire term.  But it has expanded 50% in Obama's first 5 years.The debt the year Obama took office in 1999 was $11,9 trillion.  Five years later in 2014 the debt was $17,8 trillion.  Debt increase: 49.58%.  I called that pretty good, didn't I?http://www.treasurydirect.gov/...http://www.treasurydirect.gov/...</comment>

<comment>FYI, the deficit has been lowering. And take a good luck at the spending increases in this budget. Any idea how much of them were for defense, at the insistence of the Republicans (and over the wishes of the generals themselves--and without commensurate tax increases.)</comment>

<comment>The problem is they lowered from record peacetime deficits and thus are still huge.  I don't really care where the money is being spent because we don't need to be spending that much.  I'll trade you a 50% cut in military spending for a 5% cut everywhere else.</comment>

<comment>I'd rather see some intelligence applied. 1) don't give the military what they don't even want2) don't put off infrastructure expenditures until the consequences are more costly than they would have been in the first place. 3) quit giving big checks to big ag, etc. 4) keep, if not increase, funding for the nsf, and the nih, that might keep Zika and cancer rates down or knock them out altogether. For starters.</comment>

<comment>Someone should do the world a favour and drown Grover Norquist in a bathtub. There is no hope of the compromise needed to move the country forward as long as the Republicans continue to sign his treasonous no tax increases pledge.</comment>

<comment>The real compromise is Dems getting more spending to actually help working people while the Cons get more to support their sponsors in the MI complex and tax cuts for their wealthy donors.</comment>

<comment>LOL.It's always the dyed-in-the-wool partisans who accuse others of excessive  partisanship.For better or worse, Barack Obama and Rahm Emanuel hit the ground running even before the Inauguration with FU politics. They thought that glorious mandate of November 2008 was solid and represented a huge shift.It didn't work out that way.</comment>

<comment>Hey Republicans. Ryan supports amnesty. So does Rubio. What do y'all think is gonna happen here?</comment>

<comment>So does around 70% of the American people.</comment>

<comment>My guess is the Freedom Caucus is going to pick up more votes as they represent the only actual alternative to the business as usual politicians in both parties.  The Democrats used to have a group like that, but the Blue Dog Democrats have been effectively wiped out.</comment>

<comment>That's like saying the only alternative to gonorrhea is to set yourself on fire.  Just because it's bad doesn't mean we should vote for utter disaster.</comment>

<comment>No, it's like saying when the people currently in power are fire you elect water to balance it.  Have you noticed that the opposition party, that is the party in opposition to the one with the Presidency, tends to do well in mid-term elections?  Why do you think that is?  It's because the people don't like what the siting President wants to do and want to stack Congress to oppose it.  And if a President is really popular you may find they actually send him more partisans to help, although that is rarely the case.</comment>

<comment>Probably amnesty. And we will never win an election again.</comment>

<comment>They're anti everything. And fixing to make themselves irrelevant. </comment>

<comment>I've been hearing that for the last several election cycles.  "Republicans just vote against everything, they're going to get voted out". But guess what, when the American people don't support what Obama wants to do that is exactly what the public wants them to do which is why they keep sending more of them.</comment>

<comment>The majority of Americans actually voted Rs out of office. Only through blatantly partisan gerrymandering do the nutjobs keep their seats. Only the blind and stupid think the Freedom Caucus idiots stand for what Americans actually want. </comment>

<comment>Rationalize your losses however you want.  Obama started with majorities in the House, Senate, and full control of 27 State legislatures.  Now Republicans control the House, the Senate, and have full control of 30 State legislatures.You want to blame redistricting for that loss, but guess what?  The Republicans took over the House and most of their State level gains  in the 2010 elections and re-redistricting didn't occur until after the Census results from 2010, which would have been 2011 and 2012.  So that isn't the reason why.https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>The lowest voter turnout since 1942 was the other reason why.</comment>

<comment>Once again you're talking about something after the election of 2010 where Republicans made most of their gains.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, those rabble rousers, didn't anyone tell them they're suppose to always expand the size and power of the government?  After all, that's why voters vote for Republicans, right?  Morons.</comment>

<comment>The size of government based on number of employees actually hasn't kept up with population growth.</comment>

<comment>Government spending per capita has more than doubled since the 1970's and is approximately 50% higher than the 1990's.http://mercatus.org/publicatio...</comment>

<comment>Right wingers are complete and utter morons, yourself included.I wonder what the increase in population has been over the last 40 years, or the increase in GDP?It is the ignorance and gullibility of the right wing that are the true threat to this country, as well as the banking and business interests who own them.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>So your  response to a graph showing PER CAPITA federal spending is to wonder how much the population has grown?  And you think I'm the moron?  Do you even know what per capita means?</comment>

<comment>Is that adjusted for inflation? If so, does it take into consideration an aging population drawing on Medicare and Social Security, and the fact that wages are so low that more working poor are collecting food stamps?</comment>

<comment>Net federal outlays as a percentage of GDP are lower than they were during the Reagan administration.  See date series at St Louis Fed FRED database.  https://research.stlouisfed.or...</comment>

<comment>Reagan had the highest spending as a percentage of GDP since WW 2, so what you're really saying is current spending is higher than anytime from 1947 to 1979, which doesn't sound nearly as good, does it?</comment>

<comment>If one adjusts for inflation, using the CPI and puts it on a per capita basis, federal outlays are 32 percent higher in 2015 than they were 30 years ago in 1985.  But the economy has grown faster than federal spending.  Inflation-adjusted outlays have grown by a factor of 1.8 over that time.  Real GDP has grown by a factor of 2.13.    Look, for example, at Table B-21  in the 2015 Economic Report of the President and adjust using CPI and GDP data from FRED.  All of these are available in downloadable Excel files.  John832 or the Mercatus people are either ignorant or dishonest.  Real per-capita outlays at the end of 2015 are 71.6 percent higher than in 1975 and 29.7 higher than in 1995.  But the economy has grown faster.</comment>

<comment>First, the metric you are trying to articulate in is called net Federal outlays as a percentage of GDP.  In 1970 that number was 18.185%.  In 2014 it was 20.210%, so the government has grown over 11% even by the metric you want to use.https://research.stlouisfed.or...The real issue is why you assume that the economy growing should grow the government as well?  If anything a growing economy and a static population should decrease the cost of government because less of those people are going to be unemployed and needing assistance.Think about it.  The government is responsible for people and infrastructure that is mostly related to the number of people and their distribution.  If the economy stayed stagnant would you assume the government's costs would stay the same?  That isn't enough to answer the question as you'd need to know about inflation and population growth to decide that.  A static economy with growing population or growing inflation would grow costs.  A static economy with deflation or declining population would shrink costs.</comment>

<comment>Good idea in theory, but the rifts between the various factions are growing, not shrinking. The brahmins and tea partiers don't even speak to one another.</comment>

<comment>I am guessing you hang out in the House cloak room and know these things Dana.</comment>

<comment>Read,  and from multiple sources. That's all ya gotta do. See for instance how Ryan is making out.People forget that both parties are actually coalitions, not monolithic wholes.</comment>

<comment>Insurgency will take over the existing GOP, but those who are displaced will not leave.</comment>

<comment>"Ryan showed up, if only to ask them to stand down. He argued that Democrats had been trying to sow division in the GOP for years, and in this critical election year, conservatives had to stay united."Aw, the deluded trying to lead the insane. Best of luck!</comment>

<comment>Even when its our fault its Obamas fault somehow!</comment>

<comment>Obama is the reason these guys got elected . There are millions  of Americans out there exercising their constitutional right and voicing their concerns , who want him throttled after the ACA</comment>

<comment>And Clinton will be the reason for their re-election. ...  Yup there are millions who can't think without hate....</comment>

<comment>Except for the majority who voted for him after the ACA was passed.</comment>

<comment>I was referring to those districts where those guys are from.</comment>

<comment>Yes, they are horrified by the notion of not letting poor people die.</comment>

<comment>So just to be clear, the FreeDUMB Caucus is now trying to renege on the deal they made to get Boehner to resign in the first place.  Conservatives are backstabbing jerks, no doubt about it.</comment>

<comment>There's no way to unite people who don't understand the concept of compromise</comment>

<comment>It is precisely the ability to compromise that makes a man noble</comment>

<comment>It's great when everything is a fight, coz then you never have to pick your battles!</comment>

<comment>Oh what a surprise. Who didn't see that coming? The honeymoon wasn't going to last long but in Paul Ryan's mind he thought he was the great savior! He was going to rally the troops and they would fall in line with one of the young guns turned speaker and all would be well in Ryan World.. Welcome to the real world Mr Ryan. How's that job as speaker which you didn't really want working out for you now?</comment>

<comment>Berman might be a bit pre mature on this . But now  we know what Annie is hoping for.</comment>

<comment>It's not a case of hoping anything. It's a reality. Paul Ryan is so cunning that he thought he could herd a bunch of wild cats like the one's he has to deal with and they would say yes Paul, whatever you say Paul.That won't be happening.</comment>

<comment>He'll be in the same spot Boehner was soon enough. I'd love to say he should write those guys off, rather than live in constant dread. But the GOP fed this cancer within for way too long, and I think a nutter-ectomy would kill the patient.</comment>

<comment>Unless Ryan can somehow get events into motion to oust the hardcore sect, he'll much have a very bad and frustrating SOH tenure. It was pretty much a given that he was feigning reluctance when he was offered Boehner's spot; the SOH position is just too good to pass up. I'm guessing he really believed he could calm down and have the usurpers act civil. And I thought I was a Nudnick. The big dummy.</comment>

<comment>"And they were spooked when the projected deficit shot up by more than $100 billion, partially a direct result of the spending increases and tax increases Congress passed at the end of 2015."I wonder if Mr. Berman actually meant to refer to decreased taxes rather than tax increases.  It's understandable that spending increases, without tax increases, could increase the deficit.  But tax increases should normally, at least in the short term, have the effect of helping to decrease the deficit.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Berman was wrong.  The Omnibus budget bill of 2015 included plenty of tax cuts:  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12..."The tax measure, which is expected to be approved by the Senate on Friday, would permanently extend several tax breaks that have been renewed repeatedly on a temporary basis, including a popular business tax credit for research expenses and a benefit for certain capital investments. It would also permanently extend an enhanced child tax credit, a $2,500 college tax credit and a more robust earned-income tax credit for low-income families.Other provisions in the bill include a small-but-symbolic tax deduction for teachers who spend their own money on books, supplies and computer equipment used in the classroom; and a separate deduction for state and local sales taxes. The measure would also postpone some key components of the Affordable Care Act, by delaying, for example, the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost, employer-sponsored health plans."</comment>

<comment>Because tax increases always lead to more revenue. Just ask Michigan.</comment>

<comment>You are an idiot.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Do you have any idea what I am talking about?</comment>

<comment>Oh right, it’s the Democrats’ fault that the GOP has been rolling around in the mud for the past several years.</comment>

<comment>You call gaining over 1000 seats rolling around in the mud? OK.</comment>

<comment>What exactly have they accomplished with those 1000 seats then? If they can't even agree amongst themselves to get anything done, that's rolling around in the mud.</comment>

<comment>Yup, it is the liberal's fault that they didn't implement right wing delusional policies.....</comment>

<comment>The part I don't understand about the far right is that they believe they're entitled to have everything their way. Last poll, 17% of respondents identified as a supporter" of the Tea Party, yet the Freedom Caucus honestly believes that the entire country should bend to their desires -- and will, if they only "fight" hard enough. It's a strange way to look at democracy.Hardcore liberals are just as nutty, but they seem to at least understand that they're asking for things, or need to persuade people. Sanders talks all the time about how things "should be," but he at least seems to recognize that he's advocating change, not a return to the natural order.</comment>

<comment>I didn't think Ryan would make necessarily a bad Speaker, but if he keeps treating conservative House members like they're just a pain, he can start packing his bags. These Freedom Caucus members ARE the opposition. Thats because (surprise!) they're constituencies are against Obama's policies! So...they listen to their voters! Wow, never saw that one coming, did ya?</comment>

<comment>Speaker Ryan NEEDS this job.  He has no other adult experience than politics.PLUS, the Speaker has a much bigger salary than a plain old $174,000 Representative.  $223,500 is not a job to give up just for refusing to do what the crazies demand.The poor guy is too young to join a "think" tank.</comment>

<comment>> So...they listen to their voters!You mean the majority of Republicans who want a raise in minimum wage and election money reform? Or do you mean they listen to themselves and wingnut talking heads? Wow, never saw that one coming, did ya?</comment>

<comment>You must be one of those people that read every poll but never met a republican in their lives.</comment>

<comment>Your concern is warranted. We have retreated into our clans, even moving to Geos to live with our Clans. I'm a 64 YO registered Dem. working for a corporation who used to vote for moderate Republicans when they existed. They are now listed as endangered. Politically we are as divided now as we were during the Vietnam War era. Our entire culture is at stake. Science and policy driven governance have become "liberal". All the Clans have been conditioned to hide from the truth when it comes to fiscal reality.  Hawks can't handle the need for 20% less for the military.  Liberals can't handle the need for 20% less for domestic spending. Corporate interests can't handle loosing corporate welfare and being forced to bring profits "on-shore". Hedge Fund managers can't handle paying more than 15% in taxes. Reality sucks!</comment>

<comment>Oh, and no one can handle the need for a $2.00 increase in gas taxes to pay for our crumbling infrastructure and maintain the incentives to reduce carbon pollution.</comment>

<comment>I know many of us have fault for the condition America is in. Regarding your first point, you, as a liberal, would you be willing to live in a deeply red area? If the answer's no, then you can understand why many conservatives are leaving the city, as they have turned into a very unwelcoming place for conservatives like myself.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't live there simply because deeply red areas are the poorest areas of the country and therefore have the lowest standard of living.  Plus there aren't many good jobs there.</comment>

<comment>Well...deeply blue areas like the Bronx (bluest congressional district in the country is centered there) ain't exactly affluent either. And jobs...yeah, that's a problem. That's the reason many people have been forced to move from small towns to cities since at least the 60s (probably before as well). And need comes before ideology always. But if you can find a job and settle...nothing beats a small town atmosphere, at least in my opinion. I wouldn't be rich even if I moved to the city anyways, so why bother when I feel better here? And prices are also lower here. So it's easier to be poor! I wouldn't like to be poor in NYC or Seattle. That...would suck a lot.</comment>

<comment>Some folk find peace in a lovely piece of the earth close to nature and open spaces.  Redneck-sensei is saying ( I think) that most of those places are affordable only in what you call "red areas".  If he found his lovely place, so be it if his neighbor is named Bubba who married his cousin.  Life required compromises.</comment>

<comment>Your response is an affirmation of my point. It is natural for us to want to be surrounded by our clan.  Perhaps the mobility we enjoy in America is excellerating that dynamic. Not all conservatives reject city life. NYC for example has a big, affluent, conservative population, ala Gulliani and Bloomburg. Me thinks it's social conservative that flee city life, and thats OK, that's your clan! For me, the ideal place to live is a state university town whether in a Blue or Red state (could be Chapel Hill as much as Santa Cruz). I love cities for entertainment and culture but have lived in the nearby Burbs or countryside because of the need to be close to nature and open spaces. I moved from PA (purple), to MN (Blue), to MI (purple), to CO (Purple) and now OR (Blue), motivated by a combination of the job and Quality of Life.</comment>

<comment>Ok, let's get this out of the way first: Bloomberg is not conservative in any way, shape or form. Ok, now we got that out of the way, you basically admitted "affluent, conservative population". News flash: according to the Pew Research Center, the most affluent ideological group is liberals. What does than mean? Conservatives are NOWHERE NEAR as rich as many liberals think. A man like me would be basically forced to live in Brooklyn or the Bronx if I moved to NYC, and those are basically left wing capitals in America. Never mind that I have MANY other issues with cities that do not fall on liberals (I hate crowded places...and, you know, cities are kinda crowded), so I don't only choose to live in small town or suburbs at most because they're redder, they're just more suited to my tastes in general. And just to be clear, when I said "red area" I didn't mean "red state". You can live in a very conservative area in California and a very liberal area in Texas (ehem...Austin). Very few states are mostly homogenous in their ideological stances (they tend to be small too...Vermont and Rhode Island come to mind).</comment>

<comment>Basially, I think we are in agreement about "cultural dynamics" even though we seem to be talking past each other. Perhaps we are conditioned to seeing nasty dialog in these comment sections. I'm motivated to demonstate people can talk about politics, science and policy without spitting dogma.  Reagan and Tip Oneal were buddies, FCS.  What happened with compromise?  I think of Bloomberg as a free market, fiscal conservative and a social moderate / liberal, which is true with a lot of the few, remaining East Coast current (or in his case, former) Republicans.  Gulliani had pictures taken dressed in-drag at a Halloween Ball, FCS. We agree about not wanting to live in crowded places, but I like them in small doses (night on the town, etc.).  Your right about the Liberal "enclaves" being quite affluent.  They attract well educated people who tend to be affluent and mobile.  In CO, I lived in Boulder, where the real estate costa are now as high as in the Bay Area.  As the lyrics in the Eagles song go "Call a place paradise and kiss it good bye"</comment>

<comment>I consider Giuliani to be decently conservative, especially from a law and order perspective. I know he's pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage but I still have a lot of respect for what he achieved in NYC, and I actually considered voting for him back in the 2008 primaries (went for Ron Paul, as he was more consistent with my views). But Bloomberg ain't conservative in any way. He actually said he ran as a republican only because it was easier to get elected that way. And yes, I do miss the compromise in the Reagan era. It's just that right now, compromise is pretty much impossible. Every time a democrat tells me that "we republicans don't wanna compromise" I ask "so...what are YOU willing to compromise on?". And they always come up with some excuse as to why WE should be the ones compromising and not them, pretty much. I'm sure we republicans do the same, but many things like gun rights, for instance, are VERY IMPORTANT to us, so concessions are unlikely. And yeah...those Eagles lyrics are spot on. I love their music, by the way. Too bad Glenn Frey died. Well, back on topic, that's why I don't get pissed when people call the South like it was a piece of crap, I'm like "Ok, better that way, I still wanna live here!"</comment>

<comment>Staten Island is both cheap (for NY) and conservative (again, for NY). The downside is, you would have to live in Staten Island.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I know Staten Island is comparatively red. It doesn't matter if it's cheap compared to the rest of NYC, it's still expensive as hell. And the traffic is still NYC traffic, and it's still crowded and all those "wonderful" (sarcasm, of course) traits common to cities. I don't know about that whole "the downside is, you would have to live in Staten Island" thing, though. Is there some kinda joke in NYC where y'all look down upon Staten Island for some reason? Well, I don't know.</comment>

<comment>You must be one of those people that thinks that everyone else is just like them and the limited amount of people they met. I've met many Republicans, but I know they're a limited sampling. The polls have "met" many hundreds of Republicans. Also, if I never met a Republican, then you're not one.</comment>

<comment>Have you met me? Hm, I could have swore this was the internet! And if a lot of people all the time say that the people they met don't agree with the polls it should give you pause, don't ya think?</comment>

<comment>I like your calm and willingness to have a real dialog Redneck-sensei, refreshing. Where is that lovely place in the countryside where you live?</comment>

<comment>Northern Georgia. Yep, in the Appalachians. Here we have exactly the kinds of problem you listed, but for me, it's a great place to live.</comment>

<comment>Agreed; after many trips I confirm the Smokies in April are one of the best places on earth and I say that as a current Oregonian who can see 200 ft waterfalls and 10,000 ft Mt Hood in the same field of view.  It's too bad the outdoor "enthusiests" of all stripes can't join together for habitat preservtion and to fight pollution, hill-top mining (distruction), etc.  Rupublicans in the 70's fought for these things, no more. As an example, East Coast Republicans proposed and passed Cap-and-Trade legislation to fight Acid Rain. Now Cap-and -Trade for carbon is called communism. Also you are correct how people generalize about the South.  They havent seen the hospitality, the Smokies, the Outer Banks, the barbacue!</comment>

<comment>Yep, we got quite the sights if you take some time to visit. I spend most of my time around my home, though, but when I decide to get off my ass and hit the road and go somewhere I always enjoy it. And yeah...the whole environmetalism thing is kinda hard, because we love the natural beauty of the place, but at the same time regulations are killing jobs, which unfortunately, we don't have many of in the first place. So it's kind of a hard deal. And as I said, keep 'em generalizing! Skynyrd put it better than no one in Sweet Home Alabama "Well I've seen Mr Young sing about her, I've seen ole Neil put her down, I hope Neil Young will remember, a Southern man don't need him around anyhow!"</comment>

<comment>I get the tension over protection VS job lose. Clean technologies create jobs, but jobs in the extraction industries do suffer. It's interesting that there are now more jobs in the solar industry than in coal. You think the land is suffering in places like W.Va; I travel a lot for the job. You should see the deforestation in SE Asia and the smoke during the dry season.  It looks / feels like the end of the earth. I like Neil Young's Southern Man, but the lyrics are a harsh, generalized reaction to the history of racism in the South as interpreted by a Canadian. Musically, both are damn good songs.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I know in other countries deforestation is WAY worse. That's why I get kinda pissed off at "hell, fire and brimstone" environmentalists who act like if we expanded our coal mining (or other extraction industries, for that matter) we would pretty much cause the apocalypse. And I like Neil Young too (even though I COMPLETELY disagree with his politics). And it's amazing that a canadian who probably never went to the South other than for a show or two felt qualified to write a song about life in the South. He probably was trying to latch into the market for anti-southern rhetoric in the sixties and early seventies. Although he did admit that Skynyrd's criticism was justified, and he had treated the South unfairly.</comment>

<comment>Homo Sapien is the "apocalypse". Like with hand carving, you slowly widdle away and after a while there is nothing left in your hand.  The East Coast was "tamed" 200 years ago.  There are a couple of small wilderness areas along ridgelines and the rest of the hilltops are being "topped-off". The "new" GOP wants to sell off Western Public lands, well that actually started with James Watt under Reagan. I did not know about Neil's later remorse about Southern Man. You are quite the audiophile. Is there a name for the Southern Hipster sub-species :>)</comment>

<comment>Actually, Neil's remorse was about the song "Alabama" which has very similar lyrics, and Young claimed that Skynyrd actually responded to THAT song, and not "Southern Man". The point stands, he apologized, so he's better than 95% of non-southerners who talk crap about the South and look self-righteous while doing it  And...wow...no one ever called me a hipster before lol. I thought they usually concentrate around urban areas not in small towns. Actually, a hipster would hate it here lol. I just like to listen to music in my free time, you know, sit in the yard and listen to some good music to relax after coming home from work. I doubt many hipsters do that lol (work, I mean).</comment>

<comment>I've always thought that was a great song, but a really weak retort. Neil Young sang about the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, and Skynyrd replies with blue skies, Watergate and the Swampers? How does that answer the charge?</comment>

<comment>It doesn't answer the charge. It just attacks the generalization Neil Young made. Yes, there's problems down south, but there's also wonderful things as well, and it's very common of non-southerners to avoid those wonderful things and just criticize away. How many positive songs about the south were written by non-southerners? Yeah, I know...none (or almost none). That's why Skynyrd wanted to dispel the myth that the South is a post-apocaliptic racist wasteland.</comment>

<comment>That cap and trade program to get rid of acid rain was very very successful. I don't know why it's success isn't translating into the same support being given to its use in fighting carbon.</comment>

<comment>Sad, but the reason it has not is the GOP, which has become extreme in their position on environmental protection over the years, as demonstrated by this chart from the venerable League of Conservation Voters:</comment>

<comment>http://content.usatoday.com/co...</comment>

<comment>> Have you met me?In an internet sort of way.> And if a lot of people all the time say that the people they met don't agree with the polls it should give you pause, don't ya think?You are one person. Nobody elected you spokesman and why should I trust an internet nobody like you? Also if a poll has 80% of people agreeing, then 20% aren't which could be a lot of people. Again moron, You must be one of those people that thinks that everyone else is just like them and the limited amount of people they met.</comment>

<comment>Well, THIS moron chooses to let personal experience dictate his views, not polls. Sorry if you disagree with that.</comment>

<comment>And you must be one of those people that thinks the folks you know personally are somehow magically representative of the nation as a whole. Guess what, they aren't. To state the obvious, Americans in general are less likely to be related to you, less likely to come from your hometown, and less likely to be of your ethnic and religious groups than the nation as a whole. All of these things can be drivers of political opinion. It's called the False Consensus effect. Personal experience is no substitute for methodical data collection.</comment>

<comment>But the thing is: I'm definitely not the only one that says "no one I met agrees with the polls". And the polls are proven wrong again and again and again. If you wanna trust polls, suit yourself, I sadly can't do the same thing myself. Remember: Jeb Bush was OBVIOUSLY gonna be the nominee. In the meantime, I had never heard anyone who was enthusiastic about Bush. Guess what? 3% in Iowa.</comment>

<comment>Evidence is evidence. Polls are extremely accurate under certain circumstances - one of which is temporal. Asking people to predict how they will feel months down the line is risky business. In any case, the argument for Bush was never based on polls, but on endorsements and fundraising clout.</comment>

<comment>I saw a poll once (I think it was in early 2015) that had Bush with 16% support, give or take. No one I ever heard of was enthusiastic about Jeb. And the polls were either wrong, or almost every Jeb supporter went to other candidates, which I think is unlikely.</comment>

<comment>Why would you think that unlikely? I'm sure there were quite a few people who really didn't know much about any of the others. More to the point, more unlikely than what, exactly? How do you imagine the polls being "wrong?"</comment>

<comment>But isn't Speaker Ryan the leader of the opposition in the House?  And if there's a split in the Republican caucus, then doesn't that create an opening for Democrats to become part of a de facto governing majority?</comment>

<comment>Giving a speech where you ask people to please not be what they pride themselves on being (as Ryan did at Heritage) isn't likely to succeed.</comment>

<comment>Are we sure that was "clans" and not "Klans"?</comment>

<comment>Considering how much the White Nationalists are gaining grounding in the Republican party, Ryan probably does need to unite the KKKlans.</comment>

<comment>How is this so-called "Freedom Caucus" any different from the Islamic extremists?  Steve King, Huelskamp, Jordan and others are actually despised in their districts.  We the People really need vote out these do-nothings (and good-for-nothings) this fall.</comment>

<comment>You mean FreeDumb caucus?</comment>

<comment>Quick Paul, have Joan Quigley (Nancy Reagan's medium) channel Ayn Rand to see what she would do; it worked for Ronnie! Oops, sorry about that, RIP, Joan.</comment>

<comment>"The House speaker wants to "unite the clans,"I think we should get all the clans, klans and bearded clams together to tar and feather this fellow.</comment>

<comment>We are so much in need of a third party.</comment>

<comment>Looks to me like we could end up with 4 parties. The far right hates the Republican Establishment and the far left is less than happy with the Democratic Establishment.</comment>

<comment>I'll take down the Democrits as soon as the Repuglicans are dead and gone.</comment>

<comment>You do that. </comment>

<comment>Actually, I think there is a huge moderate consensus, to which something like 75% of the American public would subscribe.This may reflect my own unapologetic liberal hawkism. But it's my beleif, anyway.</comment>

<comment>Single payer.  Keep your Internationals out of my face or I'll do you you what we did to Nagasaki.</comment>

<comment>Right.You address the most hospitable nation on earth to immigrants.</comment>

<comment>Time will tell. </comment>

<comment>Maybe, but the Constitution contains powerful incentives for two major parties.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. It's called billionaire autocrats and corporate special interest  having MORE "free speech" than 99.9% of American citizens.At least that is what the RWNJ's on the Supreme Court think the Constitution says. </comment>

<comment>Thanks for your response, but that theory doesn't explain the tendency towards having two major coalitional parties for the first two centuries of the Republic's existence.A more likely explanation is the electoral college and the construction of a presidential (as opposed to parliamentary) system of government.</comment>

<comment>I was not trying to explain the past. I am saying why the two corrupt political parties are desperate to keep third parties out in the present.My bad for not being specific. </comment>

<comment>Not a problem.  Good talking with you.</comment>

<comment>You too. ;-)</comment>

<comment>No....we are in need of an electoral system where third, fourth, and tenth parties have a say.</comment>

<comment>Bye-Bye!   Do we know how to say bye-bye?  Stupid bozo.,The Republicans are going to fill the "heartland" for the second civil war' which will not be near as exciting as the first.  They are going to point out all the hardware they cannot get at and then get blown away.,</comment>

<comment>It will be fun to watch the redneck pink mist fly as the drones drop Hellfire missiles on the hapless secessionists clutching their little pea shooters. </comment>

<comment>If it doesn't stand up to the Military in combat then it isn't covered by the 2nd.  Nukes yes, handguns no.</comment>

<comment>Of course. But it will still be fun to watch the secessionist pink mist fly. </comment>

<comment>Good luck Paul.The FreeDumb cannibals are hungry. They have not chewed on a Speaker's raw extremities for several months now.Lucky for you that you are kinda skinny. Maybe the FreeDumb cannibals will just nibble on your toes.  </comment>

<comment>There's some pretty muddied thinking goin' on up there:“It’s absolutely crucial that you guys pile on politically in order to outweigh the special-interest power,” Brat said.Not realizing that Heritage Action, the group he's referring to, is just another 'special interest power'.</comment>

<comment>the freedom caucus ,more hemoroids of the republican part,get paid,argue about everything,and accomplish nothing.VOTE OR THROW THEM ALL OUT THEY ARE NOT POLITICIANS THEY ARE TRUE IDIOTS</comment>
