<comment>Ben's problem is endemic to charitable fund raising generally. Don't respond to direct mail or phone solicitations. Yes, they tug on you heart strings. That's the tool they use to extract your money. The percent that actually goes to the cause is very low to negligible. If there is a cause that you believe in donate directly.</comment>

<comment>All this hit-piece tells us is that Ben Carson is still a viable threat in the mind of the author. Otherwise why even write it? ( I love the faux compassion for the small dollar donor.)  Ben Carson is probably the most upright man you will ever do a story on.</comment>

<comment>Because whether or not Carson was in on the scam that was his campaign is still up for debate, and evidence to the contrary is news.</comment>

<comment>A team put together spur of the moment cost more up front than those that have been planning a race all along (which is everybody else). He picked people that have been successful and they took advantage of him. Dr. Carson decided to let them go (and now they work for trump to try and improve their image). Carson has the highest favorability rating than any other candidate and have polled the best against the Democrats.  The media along with his ex campaign staffers (Bennett and watts) have done a number on carson and, yes they are trying to make sure he stays down. Trump is how the Democrats want to face in the general. But for trump he has been underestimated this whole cycle and may not be the push over they thought he would be. </comment>

<comment>Agreed</comment>

<comment>There is nothing like Republican wishful thinking. they have an  entire spin bible dedicated to wishful thinking and delusions of grandeur..Yeah, Carson is a wholesome guy and a loser. You know "nice guys"finish last as the saying goes. remember republican 'nice guy' Romney, loser  and his super loss. The "nice" guys can take it home and look in the mirror and feel good, but they can't take it to bank as winners of the debate for top dog. Only the  the winners can do that laughing all the way too Losers always point the fingers at the other guys, not understanding that there are 3 pointing back at them ....Just a Thought!!!</comment>

<comment>Strange as it seems all Trump supporters are the same ones that supported Obama.</comment>

<comment>NOT!!!</comment>

<comment>no they are not.</comment>

<comment>That is a flat out lie. I can not and never could stand Obama. He is a CFR puppet of the highest degree. Trump on the other hand is pro-American.  I don't see where you even see a comparison between the two.To date, Trump has my vote.</comment>

<comment>To date, you are a frustrated angry jealous white piece of rhinoceros dung...good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>Me too, Mandingo!  Go Trump!</comment>

<comment>Gary you self loathing loser, you get one vote, I get one vote.  Mine will cancel your out.</comment>

<comment>Sticks & stones ...  did you actually  have anything to add to the conversation? I could care less about how you perceive 'me', seeings how individually, I am as irrelevant as you are.  But a good debate is another thing ... of course when you are dealing with school children, the conversation loses its luster.</comment>

<comment>Please don' insult the poor rhino.P</comment>

<comment>From what you wrote, it looks like you are much angrier than 57girl.  Maybe you should go back to yelling at kids from your front porch.</comment>

<comment>whew.......you are a clueless senile old fart republican</comment>

<comment>Nah, I'm just one of many fed up Americans sick of watching our Nation being sold down the river by a bunch of CFR puppets who would erase our borders in favor of the NAU. Obviously, you are not, which is your prerogative. However, I'd be careful who I call clueless, if I were you. You might find it is you who is clueless in the end.</comment>

<comment>ya'll are neither careful nor will ya ever be "clueless in the end"... and have chosen to remain perpetually stoopid...ES & FYT</comment>

<comment>Love the made up words and misspelling. Lol says a lot when a person speaks like the must talk. Ya'll must be as ignorant as ya type there betterfredthandead</comment>

<comment>--- giving you 1 point for spelling "misspelling" correct ( actually one of the most misspelled words in the English language ):  then taking away two points for misspelling "y'all" and misusing it ( or 1 point if you intentionally used better's version of "y'all" ).</comment>

<comment>Would you mind explaining what "speaks like the must talk" means?</comment>

<comment>He is so American his clothing line is made in a forgein country.  He loves the Constitution so much; he wants to subvert it at every turn. The Donald's supporters project a lot.</comment>

<comment>Trump is so American he imported illegal aliens from Poland to build his building... and such a great American he broke workplace safety regulations and rules and underpaid them.http://americablog.com/2015/07...http://www.reuters.com/article...</comment>

<comment>Who cares?  I will take him over any of the others.  Already voted for #DonaldTrumpForPresident 2-16-16 in TX.</comment>

<comment>Given the fact that our factories have been moved overseas for the most part, and that Trump is a businessman, it was probably a smart move on his part.I suspect once we bring our jobs home, Trump, along with quite a few others, will be producing their goods and services on American soil, as we should have been doing all along. Maybe the American people will even be able to afford clothes made here, once our jobs are restored and our economy starts humming again. I am old enough to remember when America was thriving on our own merit. It can be again.</comment>

<comment>to bring jobs home there have to be manufacturers with plants set up and ready to go and that won't happen because they can't predict sales and don't know what the wage scale will be so they don't know how much to charge for their products. "maybe" is not enough to build an economy. America thrived on exports and working americans being able to buy the products they made. those days are gone. the u.s. cannot match chinese and southeast asian wages. there are very few separate economies, nearly the entire world is economically linked. the "good old days" are long gone and there's no going back. I don't know the answers to the problems but I know that refusing to change is not the answer.</comment>

<comment>"Given the fact that our factories have been moved overseas for the most part, and that Trump is a businessman, it was probably a smart move on his part."I don't care that everything I claim he is, is a lie - there's a justification for why he's not.</comment>

<comment>There is no doubt of Trump's hubris, now I know that his delusional, irrational supporters just love Koolaid. I thought one of the GOPs big problems with Hillary was dishonesty. Now I know that the distain for lies is dishonest. You have been very enlightening.</comment>

<comment>NUMEROUS Reasons to Vote for Trump in 2016:1.Trump Is Not a Career Politician. Career politicians have failed the people of the United States and it’s time to seek an alternative leader. It will take a long time to fix all the harm that Obama and Bush caused, but Trump is a smart man and he can do it.2.No One Owns Trump. Trump’s presidential campaign is self funded and he has no lobbyists or special interests groups telling him what to do. Trump’s loyalty will only be to America and Americans, not any political party, special interest group or foreign entity.3.Trump Is Not Politically Correct. Trump isn’t afraid to say what he thinks, and he can definitely voice his opinion. Trump does not back down or apologize for speaking his mind, and If he has a problem with you, you will know it.4.Trump Will Stop Illegal Immigration. Illegal immigration is killing the United States and hurting hard working American families. Trump loves America and will definitely stop the flow of illegal immigrants pouring into this great nation. Hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are pouring into Europe and their people can’t stop it. Trump will not let that happen here at home.5.Trump Has Excellent Negotiation Skills. Trump’s not a politician. He’s an very successful billionaire businessman. He’s a problem solver, and that’s why he’s leading in all the polls. He’s an amazing negotiator, probably the best in history. Trump will deal with trade and deal with issues without being bullied.6.Trump Will Create More U.S. Jobs and Fix the Economy. Trump will be the greatest jobs president ever elected. He will bring back jobs from China, from Mexico, from Japan, and many other countries. Bringing the jobs back will also bring the money back to the United States.7.No One Will Be Tougher on Terrorism Than Donald Trump. Trump has already been saying things publicly that our military started doing after he said it. Trump is a true leader, and will bring back our best people, or find the best people to get the job done.8.Trump Will Build the Military Back Up so It Is the Strongest in the World. Trump has already called for a military buildup so broad that no foe would ever dare challenge the United States, as well as a new health care deal for veterans stuck on waiting lists in hospitals run by the Department of Veterans Affairs.9.Trump Supports the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment is America’s first freedom. That’s because the Right to Keep and Bear Arms protects all our other rights. We are the only country in the world that has a Second Amendment. Protecting that freedom is imperative.10.Trump Will Make America Great Again. It sure seems that Donald Trump is the one holding all the cards. From stopping illegal immigration and fighting terrorism, to protecting your Second Amendment rights, Donald Trump owns the polls. Americans are sick and tired of bought and paid for politicians and it is showing.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~MORE reasons to vote for Donald Trump:1. He is a PROUD Christian husband, father and grandfather.2. Mr. Trump really has a great sense of humor.3. He is NOT DISHONEST in any way.4. He means what he says and says what he means.5.

He unites Democrats, Independents and Republicans very easily.9. He will bomb and defeat ISIS by taking the oil they sell to support themselves.10.

<comment>I'm willing to bet you could have said it better.</comment>

<comment>LiLa of course is just another delusional right-wing knuckle-dragger. But to THIS Vietnam combat veteran, your illiterate gibberish marks you as one of those who smoked, huffed, and snorted his way through his tour of duty. The VA has programs for troops like you who fried their brains in 'Nam. You need to enroll in one of them. </comment>

<comment>Was your heroic service like John Kerry's?</comment>

<comment>Naaah...I didn't get ta kill nobody.How 'bout you?ya'll one of them 'high body count" dudes that's still havin' trouble sleeping at night?TEN FOUR mfer</comment>

<comment>Can someone who speaks/writes English translate this for the rest of us?</comment>

<comment>I have a problem with #5 on the first set of redeeming qualities about Trump? Do you think he does not have illegals under his employment?</comment>

<comment>Sorry its number4 not five</comment>

<comment>Wait! I have a problem with #6 too. His clothing line and other manufactured goods of his are made in China? Whatup wit dat?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, right, no one owns Trump (except the money gods, of course). So, does that mean you're all in favor of a billionaire buying the White House? What exactly do you think someone like that is going to do for the working stiffs of this country? It's the guys like him that have been shipping all our good jobs overseas and leaving nothing but the minimum wage jobs here. He talks down the Mexicans and practically every other immigrant that's here (totally forgetting the FACT that we are ALL immigrants, well, except for the Native Americans, that is), yet he uses Mexicans for all his landscaping jobs and for construction of any of his buildings. So, doesn't that make him the ultimate hypocrite? I think so, and I also think that you have been sold a bill of goods by a snake-oil salesman.</comment>

<comment>To paraphrase and steal from one of the best; Trump was born on second base and thinks he won the World Series because he is still there</comment>

<comment>YES.  "Snake oil salesman" is a very good description of Trump.  He is a master manipulator who says what he knows his followers want to hear (in all of its vagueness and crudity).</comment>

<comment>Thank you for proving that what I posted was true. Your belief in Trump is not predicated on anything empirical. You believe what he says because you want too. I investigated his history and based on that research, I do not believe he is Presidental material. Enjoy your Koolaid, I'll stick with water.</comment>

<comment>Well said!</comment>

<comment>Thank you, I do try to keep it classy.</comment>

<comment>12. He will magically accomplish things by himself that the Constitution says Congress must initiate or approve, while "supporting the Constitution" at the same time.  Including "taking out the families" of terrorists, which would be a war crime that Congress would most certainly not support.Some other observations:As for #4, "He means what he says and says what he means", that is a silly reason to vote for him.  First of all, deluded people mean what they say, but it is only evidence of their delusion.  Secondly, he is saying what he knows a sizable percentage of the population want to hear, using overly simplistic language.  He is continually vague, giving no specifics about plans, because he knows his target audience aren't interested in details, have short attention spans, and are motivated by emotion over substance.  Thirdly, insulting the disabled, trashing a war veteran as a loser because he was captured by the enemy, and using vulgar language in front of a crowd is not "telling it like it is" or evidence of honesty.  Rather, it is evidence of a defective character.  Anyone who cannot understand the difference should not vote.  One can resist being politically correct without being a demeaning, arrogant jackass.  Of course, raging narcissists only and always see themselves in a positive light and believe that their way is the only way simply because it is their way.  As a prominent psychiatrist once put it, "a narcissist has never seen a mirror they don't love" and consider the sound of their own voice as the epitome of beautiful music.But, all that doesn't matter in terms of the election.  Trump will be the GOP nominee, and Hillary Clinton, the most corrupt politician in a generation (at least) will be the Democrat nominee.  This is not only the year of the angry voter, it is also the year where a sizable percentage of the electorate are willing to support a candidate despite all evidence of their unsuitability for office.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you will like the price you will pay for those goods, nor will the workers like the wages they will make. There will be a price to pay and that price will hit the consumer much harder than they realize.</comment>

<comment>not to mention the price of severe pollution produced by these 'manufacturing' jobs in USA....especially with remaval of EPA, etc!</comment>

<comment>Trump will "bring our jobs home?"  The same guy who had his line of suits made in Mexico & China?</comment>

<comment>Good point! ...  Gotta get 'um made where the factories are.Once we bring those factories back to American soil, I'm sure Trump will be boasting 'made in America'. I remember the days, when it was the imports that were expensive due to import taxes, before the 'Free Trade' agreements send our factories offshore.  It's time we had someone to negotiate in America's favor.Trump 2016!</comment>

<comment>ya'll are CON-fused, sho'nuffOur economy here in God's Country (California) has been over-heating and it happened because US American’s here have once again run these scurvy republiCON knaves from the sacred halls of our Government…Just like our Grandparents HAD to TAKE BACK AMERICA…86 years ago…CLEAN THE LATRINE...IN 2016! VOTE BLUE</comment>

<comment>Republican/Democrat? Two sides of the same coin, and for the most part, both sides are rolling toward a one-world government.America's future is pivoting at a fork in the road, one leg leads us to the NAU, the other to salvaging our national sovereignty.Trump is leading us back to our national sovereignty, whereas the rest of the bunch (both sides of the Isle) are NAU/NWO/CFR puppets. You have to choose the path you believe in. I remember as a child, feeling freedoms that are no longer felt anymore... I remember the illusion of what America was founded to be, and it isn't/wasn't the suppressing government overreach big government has imposed on the people, with their mandatory Obamacare, lest you get fined. BS!!!! Whatever happened to a free country?  If you are young, today's America is all you know, so you don't really know what you stand to lose. It is very sad.When you ask yourself why Trump followers are so passionate, it is because we want America back, the way we remember it to be, with secure (and respected) borders, and jobs. This nation used to thrive and it could again.</comment>

<comment>--- have you ever met a right-wing conspiracy theory you didn't instantly love ?</comment>

<comment>Study some of the key points in history, and suddenly some of those 'conspiracy theories' begin to make a whole lot of sense.  It becomes apparent as to how the 'establishment' get away with the things that it does.Between the incorporation of America 150 years ago, tweaking a few definitions ... one of the biggies ... turning corporations into people, the manipulation of the Federal Reserve. the founding of the IRS, taking gold and silver off of the table, NAFTA .... blah, blah, blah, etc., etc.,Corporate America is a far cry from our Founding Father's ideals, I am sure. But they must have known, because they tired to warn us, as did various figures throughout history. Eisenhower tried to warn us of the Military Industrial Complex, JFK tried to warn us about 'shadow governments' lingering behind the scenes and he tried to bring competition to the Federal Reserve by issuing the Silver Certificate. That didn't last long. And look at where it got him, may JFK RIP. Then, though not a President, Ron Paul has been pushing for a Fed Audit since the 1970s ... the Federal Reserve enables the wars to go on at the banker's delight. There is a reason for Conspiracy Theorists to distrust the Government and there is even better reason that these theories exist ...  connect the dots.When the IMF absorbs the Federal reserve's debt, America will be under the thumb of one-world bankers.  Coming soon. If we were smart, America would declare bankruptcy, reclaim the power of the national purse and kick the Federal Reserve (and the IRS) to the curb. Iceland jailed their bankers in 2010 (or there abouts) and reclaimed their economy. After two or three years their economy was thriving, less the middleman who sits back and collects interest on the national debt.The founding of the DOJ (legislative) which is overseen by the President (executive) is the reason Congress has been hobbled.We need to blow the dust off of our Declaration of Independence and exercise our Duties within.  I doubt this generation has even read it though. Sad.</comment>

<comment>Afford the clothes made here?  Is that humor? Manufacturing has left because companies can pay a fraction of the wages they would have to pay here in America--the cost of clothes made in American would skyrocket.And do your really believe that Trump, and what others, are planning to return to producing goods on American soil?</comment>

<comment>Hugo Boss produces suits in suburban Cleveland I know there are others. People are quick to excuse Trump and he is the first person bad mouthing illegal workers. Trumps DC hotel uses illegal Polish construction workers they don't even use hardhats. Want to bet his hotels and golf courses don't employe illegals too. </comment>

<comment>I do indeed believe that Trump will be producing his goods on American soil, once we nix the Free Trade Agreements that are crippling America. Once our jobs are back on American soil, and we raise import taxes on foreign goods and services, I think a lot of companies who moved offshore will have incentive to come home and set up shop here.Why not? America used to thrive in the days when our own factories hummed.</comment>

<comment>Why won't Trump the 'great American' release his tax returns? He said he would but has not. Even the great patriot Romney is calling him out on this. Also, Trump a great businessman? Please. Economists have shown that he could have invested the 40 million (or more) he inherited in a conservative indexed fund and sat back and made billions by now. Maybe even more than he has. The only thing Trump is good at is having the biggest ego in the world.Your made in America argument is anti-free market, anti-free trade, and anti-capitalism. We can't compete with the Bangladesh's of the world when it comes to clothing industry wages. That is unless you want government interference in the free market. Do you want the government to raise the minimum wage so people could raise a family on this salary? I bet not and there is no way Trump would. Do you want the government to step in and slap tariffs on incoming clothing in yet another role for big government? If you want big government in each of these situations you probably want to consider Bernie Sanders and not some philandering tycoon on his third wife.Whose 'merit' (as you say) is the U.S. thriving on? Russia's? China's? What is merit other than an extremely vague term? We have the biggest economy in the world (and will still be the biggest by at least 2030 according to Bloomberg), the most advanced military (by far), and one of the highest Human Development Index scores in the world. I know its a common conservative (especially Trump with his 'Make America Great Again' slogan) narrative to say the country is falling apart but its not. You make outlandish statements but cannot back it up with any real evidence. President Obama guided the country through a recovery fro the Bush fiasco. The big auto manufacturers are having record years having almost gone belly-up in the previous administration, home sales prices, GDP, consumer spending, are all up. We still have a long way to go and there are many that have given up looking for a job. The budget deficit he inherited from Bush was about 1.4 trillion and it went down steadily from 2009-2014 (I don't have post '14 data).You comment above that the President wants to erase our borders. What evidence do you have of this outrageous statement other than some knee-jerk opinion from any number of right-wing radio lunatics? Is your evidence that he doesn't invade the wrong country like Bush? Because he doesn't drop bombs on every country that looks at us funny?</comment>

<comment>"That is unless you want government interference in the free market." ....I was laughing so hard when I got to this point, I didn't bother with the rest of you ludicrous comment.You should google NAFTA, CAFTA, the SPP, the TPP, and on and on ... you NWO guppies crack me up. If Free Trade were left in the hands of private businesses, and overseen on a local basis through the Cities, States and other local government offices, less the 'FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS' that have outsourced our  jobs to the favor of everyone, except ourselves, America would still be thriving ... Hence, Make America great again ...  We need to bring our jobs back to America and kick start our own economy. Today's government has betrayed the people through their 'interference' and they've been doing it for 150 years. I'm surprised you haven't noticed by now.Free Trade has been blowing out the window, since America Incorporated. Then, in the early 1990's, Billy Boy came along and turned the fan on with NAFTA.  It is about time somebody shut the damned window.Touching on your final question ... google the North American Union (NAU) ... or the CFR (look at their mission statement). The evidence is everywhere ... GWB went to Mexico in 2005 and signed a Treaty with Mexico and Canada to merge borders with the Untied States (the NAU). Look at our illegal immigration problem and our failing economy ... wait until the IMF swallows the Federal Reserve with their one-world currency. Our borders  and our National Sovereignty are fading fast. Do some research, Google it!</comment>

<comment>Yes and since Donald said Americans make to much per hour they can work for less the minimum wage right here in America hooray.</comment>

<comment>People wanting more than minimum wage should take a few community college courses or go to a trade school if they want to climb the ladder, at the very least.Minimum wages jobs are fine for teenagers and retirees looking to fill their hours. The jobs that pay minimum wage were never meant to be 'career' jobs. Once upon a time, a long time ago, in America there was this thing called ambition. Obviously, you've never heard of it.Start paying the guy behind the counter at McDonald's $15.00 an hour and watch the price of a hamburger jump in turn.  And I suspect, if a company is forced to pay $15.00/Hr for an employee, they will be hiring the cream of the crop to get the most for their money. That is going to leave a whole bunch of people who don't have enough self-respect or ambition  to seek the skills to become employable left in the cold, or with hours cut to part time to avoid having to pay insurance, don't you think? Actually, I suspect most fast food chains and such are already doing the part-time thing to stay competitive and keep their prices affordable as it is.</comment>

<comment>I guess you were old enough to participate in segregation.  Proud of that??</comment>

<comment>Actually, I am. I was a little girl, during the Civil Rights movement.  I remember the peace felt among the races. People got along and they respected each other, prior to the civil rights movement. Families were happy, and both Mom and Dad ran the household (under the same roof, no less). I grew up in a small country community where everybody knew their neighbors, in spite of the miles between us, black or white.  As time went by, I also remember some angry black youth walking up to me in Jr. High School chanting that my parents kept their parents as slaves, which was absolutely ludicrous. The Civil Rights Movement had begun. I don't know why the people waited for so long. The Civil War had been over for a hundred years by then. My parent's weren't even born in the same century, and I dare say that today's generation can not, nor should it have to, be held responsible for a war that was fought 150 years ago over. It is over.I remember when families were close, and loving, and clean, and most households had both Mom and Dad at home. Dad worked, and mom took care of the household and as a family, they managed to live quite comfortably on one income. Very few families had a two family income, nor did they need one. Now everybody is so busy chasing a frigging dollar to pay for taxes, and Obamacare, and this fee, and that fine, and ya de da de da ... it is no wonder there are so many one parent households, many of which are living on welfare, and in some cases, for generations.America's hope and its pride have been stolen. If you are young, then I don't expect you to realize the feeling of at least 'feeling' free of government overreach. It was a time when people had self respect and self assurance. They were too busy working for their keep to get into trouble. Before there was any such thing as welfare and or social security (both had already been implemented by the time I was born), I hear tell families took care of each other from one generation to the next. Families were close and they stood by each other. Today, it seems they kill each other.Anyone born in this Century, or perhaps the late 90's will have nothing to compare then and now with. But, I have, and I am telling you ... America is getting ready to jump track. Our economy is getting ready to crash, and from what I have read, the IMF is prepared to take over and save the day. The IMF handles SDRs (a one world currency). If they hijack our economy, you can compare today's America with the NAU in the coming years. Another option, go ahead and go bankrupt and restructure our economy like Iceland did in 2012. They broke free of the IMF and reclaimed the power of their purse, and have been thriving ever since.You can go to Wikipedia and look up SDRs and read all about them. I don't people have connected the dots. We are on the verge of losing our National Sovereignty. Trump can't stop the crash, but I think he'd be the best suited to pick up the pieces and put America back on track in the aftermath of the chaos ... which is why the establishment is in a panic.Like Trump, or not ... he is the only one who has focused on resurrecting our borders. And I think he has every intention of doing it, if it is not too late already.</comment>

<comment>Anybody want a Donald Trump Tie made in Mexico?</comment>

<comment>Once we move our factories back to America, President Trump can produce his ties right here on American soil. Won't that be sweet! American jobs brought home ... I can't wait!</comment>

<comment>The difference is that Obambi attracted the bimbos of the left while Humptie Trumptie attracts the bimbos of the right.    Obambi attracts racists organizations like the Nation of Islam, Black Panthers, BLM, United Nubian Nation of Moors, etc like Humptie Trumptie attracts racists organizations like the KKK, Aryan Nation, Christian Identity, White Nationalists, etc. Obambi has his bimbo Mandingo and Humptie Trumptie has his bimbo 57girl.   Recently,  BLM teenage thug sympathizers beat up and  robbed a military hero  Chris Marquez while he was eating at a McDonald's in Washington DC.  Has Obambi called war hero Marquez to express sympathy like he did with the teenage criminal Tampon Martin? Of course not.</comment>

<comment>You're so good at nicknames</comment>

<comment></comment>

<comment>notice he robbed her 'hairdo'....maybe you are right!</comment>

<comment>So who are you rooting for, Hillary the criminal, or Bernie the Socialist?On the Republican side, all you have to choose from is a Canadian born Dual Citizen, accompanied by his CFR wife, or Rubio ... who's eligibility is questionable, since his parents were not American citizens at the time of his birth,even though Marko himself was born on US soil. That would make him an Anchor baby, not a natural born citizen ... which used to be a prerequisite to the Presidency per our US Constituion ... the original version.As much of a gentleman as Dr. Carson is, I don't see him standing a snowball's chance at making it for more than a month, given the poll numbers ... he may as well save his money, unless he's making money under the table with his campaign, which I doubt he is. Dr. Carson does not 'appear' to be the same old sleaze most of them are, but he is too soft spoken to be a strong leader.Then there is Donald Trump, who puts the cards face up on the table and doesn't care whose toes he steps on in the process ... as long as he wins. That is exactly the personality we need to negotiate on behalf of America's better interest.Trump has admitted he's played both sides of the fence. Where's the lie? He's been there, done that, and knows how the game is played. I am sure, with his negotiation skills, President Trump will put America back in the black, unless of course the economy crashes all together and the IMF comes riding in on their white horse to save the day with their SDRs.You can call me all of the names your little heart desires if it makes you day, but I am willing to take a chance on Trump above the rest, simply because he has not sold his sold to the lobbyists, if anything he has bought THEM. No matter, America is a corporation, and that is not apt to change anytime soon, so we may as well elect a smart, cunning CEO who is the only one standing on stage with the ability and the balls to resurrect America's sovereignty and secure our borders while we still have borders to secure.</comment>

<comment>The comparison is simple. While Obama is a progressive, and Trump has no discernable ideology except caring about his money, both have run similar campaigns based on empty promises and cult of personality, convincing gullible voters that redemption comes from making the candidate their leader. Neither man had any proven record to prove they could deliver.Also, btw, babbling about CFR shows your ignorance. Obama's leftwing views are what is dangerous, not CFR and Obama's not a 'puppet' but a willing leftist. Trump is as establishment insider as anyone.</comment>

<comment>Wait until you find out that Trump is pro-Trump; just as he always has been.</comment>

<comment>You just SOUND stupid. You wouldn't KNOW this, of course...but you're a total simpleton. People like you really ought to stay out of politics. Incidentally if you're a girl, WAY worse. Female Trump fans...like women who write to Manson.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the reply........And that is the extent of your spin bible Carson Lackey LOSER   comment?? You certainly are just full of assumptions and delusions for a dumbed down Republican voter base Carson lackey and loser. Yeah all the votes for Trump are the same ones that voted for President Obama. Now that you have been humored and down graded as usual as a Carson campaign down graded loser, you can get back to your spin bible of futility and come with another dumbed down comment, right James old auld ang sang Carson lackey and loser loser ....Just a Thought!!</comment>

<comment>Got any data on that?  Sources?  Meantime, hilarious.  Hang onto that mic--you're going places!</comment>

<comment>That is absolutely bs...I don't remember the knights of the ku Klux Klan supporting Obama. Trump has white supremacist supporting him, he has tired old uneducated white bigots supporting him, and he has brain diseased Fux news indoctrinated domestic terrorists supporting him. I doubt any of those white devils even contemplated voting for a...negro.</comment>

<comment>Look at Haiti, Detroit and Africa. Why would a white devil vote for that, Rastus?</comment>

<comment>i wonder - do you have facts - or is this just your stupid clueless opinion....</comment>

<comment>Actually 20% of the Trump supporters surveyed were NOT happy that Lincoln freed the slaves.</comment>

<comment>No effing way!</comment>

<comment>It does seem strange because it is not true. My goodness, where do you people come up with this stuff?</comment>

<comment>That is complete bullshit and you know it you lying piece of shit!</comment>

<comment>Not even close. The Obama supporters at least have working brains, whereas Trumpeters! seem to be nothing but rabid dogs frothing at the mouth. Hypocrites, low-intelligence idiots, poorly educated, those are all hallmarks of Trumpeters!</comment>

<comment>Gosh James that was ignorant lol</comment>

<comment>Still hoping for change</comment>

<comment>You are either kidding, if so not funny, or you are a moron, much more likely!</comment>

<comment>No. they are not.  According to the website YouGuv and the organization Public Policy Polling, a recent survey of Trump supporters in South Carolina showed that 70% wanted the return of the Confederate flag to the state capitol, 38% wish that the South had won the Civil War, and nearly 20% disagreed with the thrust of the Emancipation Proclamation.  While about 78% of all Republican voters disagreed with the statement that whites are racially superior to blacks, only 69% of Trump supporters held that belief.  So the man, whatever his populist leanings, tends to attract racists and xenophobes.  Not a particularly "American" way to run a respectable campaign.</comment>

<comment>That was blatantly idiotic.</comment>

<comment>Uh, not this one.  You do realize that about half of us are for Sen. Sanders?  The other half are for HRC, for what it's worth. Most of the Donald supporters are the same ones that voted for Sarah Palin as VP.</comment>

<comment>"Strange" because it is patently false.  Where on earth did you get that?</comment>

<comment>So--- successfully scamming someone is just.... what?  Their tough luck?</comment>

<comment>Some people are taught what to believe and some are taught how to think and some are taught to think for themselves and some just learn to think for them selves. Something lacking in this day and age. Nearly every news articles shows bias and in such tries to tell people what to believe and/or think. Not enough people ask questions that should be asked. You I gather from your statement are a lib. And what is the end game for liberalism. Utopian socialistic society?  How dose one get there by turning the people against each other to achieve votes for elections and than turn things to the image they project? More questions. Not every person is (lets stay with the presidential race) suppose to win, obviously,  but dose that mean that those that don't win contributed nothing? If those that didn't win contributed something, what did they contribute? </comment>

<comment>Some shouldn't post. It dose no goods.</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a true "Trumpeter"!!</comment>

<comment>Is that like a person that plays in a band?? Or a dumbed down patsy of the big con, Trump,  from the big Apple?? either way, I'm sorry to have trumped your delusion and confusion, NO... I am neither,. Just a humble observer and portrayer of pragmatism......Just a Thought!!!</comment>

<comment>But, just look at the books he and his wife have sold.</comment>

<comment> Look at the books?? Yeah, it would be a picture book like the "Dick and Jane See Spot Run" elementary  comprehension level "reader"   and that is the type of person, probably like you that LOOKS at books because they have a difficult  time in  "reading" a  book like all you   voter base Republicans, right LiLa, Repugnant-Can voter base book  LOOKER-Ater, Ha, Ha, Ha, .....Just a Thought!!....Just a Thought!!</comment>

<comment>Well no worries then for the Democrats because Billary is anything but nice, decent wholesome and honest.</comment>

<comment>Well then, She should have the big Con from the big Apple as her press secretary of  Prevarication and Propaganda, right Repugnant-Can  voter base of Futility and Lunacy.  Right Repugnant-Can , Belinda ?? When was the last time you looked in the  mirror?? You should wipe your mouth, you have a lot of crap on your lips, as usual.. Now back to your Whine cellar and some more Zombie Juice. All replies appreciated especially from poor dumbed down Repugnant-Cans such as you and your old worn out spin bible of delusion and confusion. Your boring attempts at saying something, anything are so pathetic, I enjoy dumping on Repugnant-Can patsies of their Repugnant-Can party of Futility, Lunacy, Delusion and Confusion. And now the typical Repugnant-Can reply of worn out diatribe and vitriol of yester year, as usual, right Repug Belinda??...Just a Thought!! .....Just a Thought!!</comment>

<comment>The corrupt media and the political elite are against Dr. Carson because of his honesty and morals. Two strange traits to them. If someone with honesty and morals was elected President he would upset their strangle hold on America. Obama is the worst President ever that is until Trump is elected</comment>

<comment>Carson has no morals or honesty. He is a bigot and liar. A completely delusional, intolerant Christian.</comment>

<comment>Why is that, James? It seems to me, we'll be needing Trump to fix Obama's mess.</comment>

<comment>you moron - obama fixed bushes mess - clown</comment>

<comment>Oh, is that why we are approaching a$ 20 Trillion deficit? You are funny. The past few Administrations (on both sides of the Isle) have been passing the torch back and forth for decades. If you believe that Obama is any different than Bush, think again. Both men cater to the UN and the CFR/NWO. Ditto for Billy Boy and Daddy Bush, etc. and so on.Trump, on the other hand, is pro-American and I think sincere in wanting to salvage this Nation's sovereignty, while there is something left to salvage. If we don't break away from the 'establishment' PDQ, we may not have borders left to protect by 2020.By the way, is there some reason that when you left leaning folks don't agree with others, you feel it necessary to start with the name calling? It really does make you look immature. You guys make it difficult to have an actual debate when you offer no substance to the conversation.</comment>

<comment>Appropriations start in the House, who's controlled that since 2010?</comment>

<comment>What difference does it make? Behind closed doors, both parties are pretty much the same, and they are both headed in the same direction ... toward the NAU/NWO.Trump is getting ready to upset the apple cart, and I pray will, indeed, be able to secure America's borders and bring our jobs home. We are a Sovereign Nation in need of resurrection.</comment>

<comment>The difference is that, you're perfectly capable of seeing why he'd do exactly the opposite of what he claims for personal benefit. Nor do you have any problem with justifying it to yourself, entirely ignoring that he sets the tone. If he won't even hold himself to a higher standard, you can be sure he has no interest in the country. Whatever benefits America will be at best a happy coincidence.And one word of advice, stop using the term "sovereign nation" - you look silly.. GWB's justification of the US using America's right as a sovereign nation as to attack Iraq was spurious, as Iraq's right as a sovereign nation was to manage its own internal affairs. Using this word this word in American political discussions is always by people that have no understanding of the term, because every country is sovereign. And when every snowflake is special, none are ... K?</comment>

<comment>Tell me true now, 57girl: Can jet fuel melt steel beams?</comment>

<comment>Nope.</comment>

<comment>It takes two to make a mess; think congress might have had a part in the mess?  I have never understood the intolerance of the republican party and I have voted for many of them.  I cannot believe Croryn has agreed to not look at any judge Obama may chose to nominate for the SC.  And being from Texas, Cruz has not done his job in the senate.  All he has done since being elected has been run for president.  I helped elect him and he has done a sh*tty job for ME and I am disgusted with him and the whole bunch in Congress.</comment>

<comment>Congress has its hands tied behind its back, and will have as long as the DOJ is in operation.</comment>

<comment>No your illustrious dullard, Republican Benny Boy Carson and his 3% voter approval is going to take the country by storm, hypnotically, just wait and see after everyone wakes up from  their hypnotic  deep sleep through another dull, boring,embarrassing campaign speech from the Hypnotist Republican 3%er Benny boy Carson, right Carson lackey and loser  James Auld Ang Sang and his spin bible of Futility and delusion and prevarication, now deal with that Carson Lackey and loser, Ha, Ha, Ha, ...... P.S. keep it coming, you are such a dumpling Carson patsy....Just a Thought!!!</comment>

<comment>And gnashing of teeth. </comment>

<comment>oh stfu - idiot</comment>

<comment>Name one thing so horrible Obama has done besides the obvious teabagging talking points.... crickets are chirping, can you speak louder teabags.</comment>

<comment>Cash for Clunkers, Fast and Furious, Obama Care, Border Security, The Mid East nuclear deal, our National Debt. Let's not forget Acorn, US prisoner releases, 5 for 1 prisoner exchanges and so many more....can I stop now?</comment>

<comment>and you consider those bad ?!? people that couldn't afford health care can now ; iran deal - you WANT to go to war ? are the rest of the countries that signed off on the deal and actually live within close reach are wrong ?!? prison release of non violent crimes are wrong ?!? acorn had nothing to do with Obama - it was there when he got there -duh ! national debt was there before he got there ! he didn't steal the surplus in social security - your boy did ! border security ? don't forget that bush also wanted to legalize undocumented workers but the ones that benefitted from them didn't want them ! speaking of wich : who the hell hires them ?!?you NEED to get out more ; sitting in front of a computer or the tv ( faux news) has addled your brain !</comment>

<comment>Um, ok.  So either Carson is too stupid to have realized that his staff was running a scam for months (despite numerous articles discussing this over the last half year or so) or else he was in on it all along.  Fool or crook; either way he seems like a terrible candidate for POTUS.Personally, I think he was in on it all along, as he seems to have been more interested in raising money and selling books than actually running for POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Carson accomplished, what he set out to do. He raised, his speaking fees to six figures, his new book was a best seller, and his prior books sold better, than when they were released.</comment>

<comment>carson was/is just your everyday token Black man trotted out , TRYING to make people " think" they're not racists !anyone remember mr. "9-9-9" ?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, and the pope might be Muslim.</comment>

<comment>Next question:  Why would Donald Trump hire on people suspected of "using Carson's campaign as an ATM"???  Unless.....</comment>

<comment>I didn't laugh out loud, but your fantasy is QUITE humorous.Thank you!</comment>

<comment>Carson has always been honest. It's who he is. So it appears that he gave his staff too much leadway before letting them go for not being financially responsible, like he is. He probably waited too long, but regardless, he's focused on his campaign policies and has done a good job of that, as evidenced on his website ( bencarson.com ). Whether he wins or loses in this Presidential campaign, he's performed as an honest, straight forward American. That's what has drawn so many people to him. The MSMedia, and particularly this website and many of its followers, can only speculate and lie in their attempts to put Dr Carson in a bad light. Your attacks are transparent and foolish. None of the mud you throw will stick to him.    When all is said and done, whether he succeeds or not in his attempt to be President, he'll be met by his family and friends, those who know him best with the loving acceptance of "well done, good and faithful" follower of Jesus. And when he crosses over into Heaven, Jesus himself will say the same thing, because it's true.</comment>

<comment>What this means is that Carson's advisers have been enriching themselves off his campaign. You could say the same for Jeb Bush's campaign.</comment>

<comment>And anyone else that comes to mind too.....Just a Thought!!!</comment>

<comment>Carson told you dummies months ago that he was suspending his campaign because he was going on his book tour.  You poor saps, Cain, dud it during the last election now Carson.  Wake up America!!!</comment>

<comment>All your comment tells us is that you suck at reading comprehension.</comment>

<comment>mm</comment>

<comment>He's just doing this to make money.  Sick</comment>

<comment>Wrong</comment>

<comment>You are the one who is wrong. Wake up and smell the coffee.</comment>

<comment>nope - right</comment>

<comment>There is not much else he could do as a Republican presidential candidate without knowing anything outside of an hospital operating room. ....Just a Thought!!!</comment>

<comment>I was blinded by a grain silo.</comment>

<comment>That is very apparent with the Republican party of Futility and Lunacy and their voter base of LOSERS.....Just a Thought!!</comment>

<comment>What passes for modern "journalism" these days is a disgrace.Evidence?From the article: "For months, reporters and political operatives (including me) have been pointing out that Ben Carson’s campaign bears many of the hallmarks of a political scam...."Months and months of a hit-piece and this guy is still in the race. The "regressives" are pulling their hair out....</comment>

<comment>Still in the race...at what 4-5% in Nevada?</comment>

<comment>Did you not read the article? "Carson seemed to suggest as much on Tuesday, implying he was taken advantage of by aides who treated the campaign as an ATM."</comment>

<comment>Probably not.  The new 'Republican base' has been taught to accuse first and read later, if at all.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you don't understand what the word "seemed" means.This is a sad "journalistic" hit piece and a disgrace to what claims to be the "4th Estate".</comment>

<comment>Ah - so you didnt read the article OR Carson's statement on Tuesday. That would be important context for understanding this piece</comment>

<comment>Ah....so you can't comprehend simple demonstrations of your bullshit.</comment>

<comment>Much of the conservative movement is just a scam designed to feather pockets. Not all: the NRA gets 'er done. However, groups like Teaparty Patriots, NumbersUSA, etc. take in money and then rarely deliver anything. NumbersUSA could stop amnesty as a concept if they did things the smart way, but that would also mean Roy Beck and his son would be out of a job.</comment>

<comment>It's funny that you scoff at the evidence presented, then quote a portion of the piece that doesn't actually touch on the evidence... but giving you the benefit of the doubt:The evidence that his campaign is a scam is the sheer volume of money that has been paid to campaign insiders. And not just supporters (which is a pretty normal, if unfortunate, part of politics) but people in key decision making positions within the campaign who are either paid exorbitant amounts for their services (like Dean Parker, the "finance chair" whose position was mainly honorary, who was drawing $20k/month as a salary before quitting after that fact was brought to light) or who send significant amounts of paid-campaign business to their own enterprises (like the $4.7 million of business, in the last quarter alone, that went to Eleventy Marketing Group, which just so happens to be owned by the campaign's chief marketing advisor).And those are just two quick examples. Digging into the campaign's FEC filing turns up plenty more of the same kind of thing.So THAT is why his campaign "bears many of the hallmarks of a political scam".As for his "still being in the race"? It's true that he hasn't suspended his campaign. But consistently coming in at the bottom of the polls without any meaningful improvement almost certainly means he has no chance at getting the nomination, so he's not really "in the race" in that he has no hope of winning and there's no consolation prize for sticking it through to the bitter end.</comment>

<comment>I think Ben is a good man, who was too arrogant to have proper checks in place to make sure his "friends" were on the up and up.  I like a lot of Ben's ideas and I think he would make a terrific surgeon general</comment>

<comment>Presumably the Surgeon General has to believe in science because, you know, health and science kind of go together. Carson believes being gay is a choice because prison turns people gay; doesn't believe in evolution; thinks the Big Bang is a fairy tale ... and the list of his looney tunes beliefs goes on and on.</comment>

<comment>So let me get this straight, in order to understand medicine, one needs to buy into man made global warming? A political fad that requires manipulating data to match the narrative?  Well there goes any credibility you may have had.</comment>

<comment>he sux - dumb too</comment>

<comment>"Dumb"?Compared to who?You?Ha ha ha ha ha ha......</comment>

<comment>The more I see of Ben Carson The Candidate today, compared to the Ben Carson Whiz Surgeon of yesteryear, the more I'm convinced there's something legitimately medically wrong with him. His oddly sleepy demeanor, his strange lines of reasoning, and the fact that two teeth just fell out of his head in a campaign stop in May... None of that points to "brilliant surgeon". And yet, he once was a brilliant surgeon, and there's no debating that. Something has changed.I also have a feeling the man himself knows there's something wrong, which is why he quit performing surgeries entirely, but hasn't seen a doctor to get an actual diagnosis. Which is a pretty common thing among doctors. They make the worst patients, and are usually happy to diagnose themselves and not seek out additional opinions....so no, I don't think he would make a very good surgeon general, and not just because I disagree with all of the policy positions I've seen coming from him. I don't think it's appropriate to appoint someone apparently suffering from a disease causing mental decline to a position like that.</comment>

<comment>There is ZERO "evidence"....but many claims.If you are looking for "evidence"....check Hillary "Jail Her" Clinton's FBI files.</comment>

<comment>Apparently you're not aware that simply repeating a contention doesn't make it true.Especially when you claim things like "There is ZERO 'evidence'" in response to a comment that contains the evidence you claim doesn't exist....I'm probably giving you more benefit of the doubt than you deserve, though.</comment>

<comment>Actually, calling them "regressive" is too kind in my opinion.  A better term would be "retrogressive" since their economic policies typically have proven only to move America backwards.</comment>

<comment>Campaign spending is public information....this is not the first article on BC's campaign reckless spending on fundraising.  Maybe, just maybe, you should try doing some of your own research before spouting off accusations.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should stop being a stooge and useful idiot for the left you dope.</comment>

<comment>"Months and months...and this guy is still in the race"Consider the following edit: strike the words "in the race" and replace with the words "refusing to go home"</comment>

<comment>Say the same for Hillary.....or "Federal Prisoner 865478923"</comment>

<comment>Because nothing says "upright' more than the ability to hit a belt buckle with a knife, and the insight to understand the correct uses for the pyramids. Plus, this guy is a REAL black guy, not like that phony Obama black guy.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention convincing a robber to go after another guy at a "Popeye's Organization".</comment>

<comment>Because the author has to churn out a certain number of articles per week and this is a mildly interesting and relevant story?  I keep hearing about how Ben Carson is so upright, but I don't buy that a guy that smart didn't realize his campaign managers were misusing funds and I also can't forget that he was all too ready to sacrifice women and children in a Middle Eastern war.</comment>

<comment>Obviously there's still enough money to astroturf support on message boards.</comment>

<comment>and hapless at everything but neurosurgery, apparently</comment>

<comment>What, after he got a whopping 5 percent of the vote in Nevada?  He has basically no delegates. How is that viable?</comment>

<comment>Love it</comment>

<comment>I don't think anyone, anywhere views Carson as a viable threat. The only real question is how soon his flawed and failed campaign will sputter into the station named Suspension.</comment>

<comment>BENGHAZI !!!!!!!!!!!!!! Another conspiracy theory schizophrenic.</comment>

<comment>And don't forget WMD'S in IRAQ too. That was the Master Deception that all Republicans prefer to forget too.....Just a Thought!!!</comment>

<comment>or.......republican viagra</comment>

<comment>A viable to whom? The author?  Certainly not to winning the nomination.  He should be gone.  If Ben Carson wondered out loud about his campaign operatives motives, Why is everyone on the right so paranoid? I swear Fox News and talk radio have rotted people's brains.</comment>

<comment>Carson has been circling the bowl since Iowa. This is become an extended book tour for Carson and the longer he hangs on the more he can increase his speaking and media gig bill rates. The question the article raises is whether he is running a grift on his supporters or whether he is blissfully unaware that his aides are which would cast serious doubts on his leadership skills.</comment>

<comment>a black turd.......ugh</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Carson is such an upright guy he even suspended his campaign to sell more books!</comment>

<comment>Wow.  You're really separating the fly shit from the pepper there.  His uprightness isn't the issue.  What is, is his ability to handle complex problems, issues, and tasks and keep under control those who arguably work for him..  Someone who doesn't know whether his own campaign is a scam should not be sitting in the Oval Office.</comment>

<comment>jesus - he is as dumb as you....maybe dumber. i am amazed anyone would vote for this clown</comment>

<comment>Ben may be a qualified surgeon, but he is not qualified to be anything above a mayor in politics.</comment>

<comment>You're in denial buddy. Carson hasn't been a viable candidate since Iowa. He has a dedicated 5%, and has negative momentum, is running out of $ and the only press he has been getting for the past 3 weeks has been negative. My guess is the 5% he is retaining are the dopes who got grifted by his aide-de-pimps and there MLM fundraising scheme.The only thing Carson staying in the campaign is doing is possibly keeping Trump from gaining another 2.5% of the votes, while Cruz, Rubio & Kasich would fight over the remaining 2.5% up for grabs. Basically, Carson's supporters are folks who are fed up with DC insiders but who don't want to vote for Trump because they're either minorities, or they just dislike Trump, which is more than understandable.To back my assertion, 4-5 days ago, Carson himself said (paraphrasing) "I'm getting a lot of pressure to stay in this race".</comment>

<comment>Btw- Most upright man?Why? Remember his belt buckle story? How about the fraudulent supplement company that he denied being a paid spokesman for, despite the fact his face was still featured on their website? Oh yeah, when he got busted on that one mid-debate, I seem to recall him bumbling some words and basically saying, well I don't know why I'm on their website, but I take the supplement everyday and it's done great for me". </comment>

<comment>What hit piece?  The words came out of HIS mouth.</comment>

<comment>Still a viable threat?  Lol!</comment>

<comment>You've seriously got to be kidding me. Ben Carson is either a complete lunatic, or pretending to be one to appeal to complete lunatics.</comment>

<comment>Carson's campaign is an icky ego-trip, and he needs to disappear, as of yesterday.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he probably is, which is why those desiring to take advantage is such a horrid thing.</comment>

<comment>People can raise questions about a presidential campaign without that candidate being a "threat."  And I don't think anyone seriously thinks that Carson is a threat, seeing as how he's coming in dead last now.</comment>

<comment>carson is an idiot/savant."...a threat in the mind of the author." NOT!!!  nor ever was...</comment>

<comment>http://www.charitynavigator.or... is a pretty good resource.  They take the annual reports of charities and report on certain criteria -- like how many cents per dollar donated actually go towards the cause.Carson's campaign would evidently get very poor ratings based on that criteria.</comment>

<comment>Thank you!  Data can be manipulated but tax returns tell the truth (unless someone is willing to go to prison).  Ronald McDonald foundation is about as good as it gets, even their CEO is an unpaid volunteer. </comment>

<comment>Yea - like relentless advertising for car insurance - guarantees its not the cheapest.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  That is at least part of the problem, certainly.</comment>

<comment>carson is a bona fide imbecile.  that's his problem.</comment>

<comment>I only give to those organizations that I seek out .Never those that contact me.</comment>

<comment>Great idea, and donate directly.</comment>

<comment>Not only that, as soon as you donate a dollar then they keep hitting you up for more and more money, and you get put on the mailing lists of all the other groups they share their donor lists with.  If at all possible, donate anonymously.</comment>

<comment>Ben Carson is a man of exquisite integrity. </comment>

<comment>Exquisite here meaning lacking?</comment>

<comment>Or delicate as opposed to robust....</comment>

<comment>That's why I gave him $100 dollars, so that he could use $99.99 of my money paying his cronies to convince me to donate another $100.</comment>

<comment>It's like the prosperity gospel.</comment>

<comment>Amen, brutha! (Sista?)</comment>

<comment>You're a sock puppet.</comment>

<comment>I think your thesaurus must be broken, "exquisite" is not a synonym for "without a shred of".</comment>

<comment>I think I'm the only one that got the joke.  Maybe try the /s next time</comment>

<comment>Carson = Grifter</comment>

<comment>Gee, Atlantic, couldn't you chosen an even more ludicrous frame grab of Carson's face?  That's really cheap journalism.</comment>

<comment>They've been running a lot of Salon-esque cover photos lately, and I agree. It's lame.</comment>

<comment>This picture nails Carson's grasp of the situation and works synergistically with the article.</comment>

<comment>And is also a cheap shot.</comment>

<comment>At least his eyes are open in this one...Why are you defending this joke of a Presidential candidate?</comment>

<comment>If Carson doesn't win, that's one thing. Ppl win some, ppl lose some. If it wasn't for Carson, ppl would still be living in fear of political correctness. Trump just capitalized on that, but Carson started it. Carson has given ppl courage to do what's right, even if it costs them. Ive seen more political figures making stands since Carson entered the race. He encouraged ppl to have a backbone without being nasty. He's made major impact on American ppl already. </comment>

<comment>"Carson has given ppl courage to do what's right, even if it costs them."Who?  Who gained courage from this man's farce of a campaign?  It hasn't been Trump.  Trump has always said whatever dumb thing pops into his head without worrying about it.  The other GOPers are fairly similar these days.  None of look to Carson for inspiration.  What is inspiring about a ditsy political failure.Also, type out the word 'people'.  Using unnecessary abbreviation just makes your post look like something from 4chan.</comment>

<comment>Political figure. Not showman. :) Anyways, I believe senate made a stand concerning scotus pick due to influence of Carson's character. His integrity can be convicting, bringing shame to those who say one thing, but do another. Republicans seems to always cave anymore, but not this time. Hopefully they will continue to stand. And that's just one. </comment>

<comment>Sorry, but that's just delusional. The GOP in the Senate never needs any influence or inspiration to act selfishly in the interest of their own party. Carson will be just as irrelevant as Fiorina, Jindal, Santorum, etc. when he ends his campaign. He's almost there already.</comment>

<comment>Everybody's influenced by somebody. No one person is an island all to themselves. I respect your opinion though. </comment>

<comment>You should learn real English before you attempt to post in English again.</comment>

<comment>".....the courage to do what's right, even if it costs them"  Who has paid what price?  Please provide citations. What "major impact"?</comment>

<comment>Some of us know what's right without needing Carson or anyone else to tell us.</comment>

<comment>True, but anyone can start to slip towards a downward spiral. Even Carson. That's why accountability is good. Keep things on the up and up. Washington needs to be held accountable. </comment>

<comment>Sorry to tell you, Carson's not gonna be the guy to do it. Only way he's gonna make it to the WH is on a tour with 45 other people.</comment>

<comment>Ok</comment>

<comment>Carson is apparently not willing or able to be accountable for his own campaign funds. Who are you kidding?</comment>

<comment>"ppl would still be living in fear of political correctness. "Personally, I was scared that Dr. Ben would come into my kid's school and start policing it for what he deems to be extreme political ideas, like he said he was going to do.Enough of this free speech/anti-PC act. You're scared of liberalism, not political correctness.</comment>

<comment>Enough of this free speech??? Yes, you're right, I'm scared of liberalism. </comment>

<comment>I clearly typed the word "act" after that.You guys use a free speech angle when really all you want to do is silence liberal ideas.</comment>

<comment>Everyone wants to express their views freely, but, for instance,  if I disagree, then I'm made out to be devil. That is an example of suppression of free speech.    People would rather be quiet than ridiculed or humiliated, especially in public. </comment>

<comment>You apparently have no concept of what "Free Speech" is...  if you say something stupid, it is not suppressing your free speech to call you an idiot.  If I'm your employer, it is not suppressing your speech if I fire you because I don't want idiots working for me.No one prevents you from saying whatever dumb thing you want.  Have at it.  But free speech is not the same as speech free from consequences.</comment>

<comment>I don't dispute what you say at all. I agree 100%.  But that is how it begins. As with most things, it evolves into something much larger, where people are reluctant to make a stand or speak up for fear of persecution. </comment>

<comment>"Everyone wants to express their views freely, but, for instance, if I disagree, then I'm made out to be devil."If I say you're the devil for what you say, aren't we all just speaking freely? Your suppression of me calling you a devil, is in fact your suppression of my free speech."People would rather be quiet than ridiculed or humiliated, especially in public."Then that is their choice, but their free speech is available to them, it's not my fault if their beliefs are hated by society.Freedom does not mean there are no consequences to our actions.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you on this basic example, but as all things, it escalates into something it was never intended to be, being made into hate speech or used for a political agenda. In time, would I be criminalized for speaking against a popular opinion? </comment>

<comment>Political Correctness is a scheme contrived by Republicans in order to frame the left as tyrannically holier-than-thou for trying to "control discussion."Today, you only see the word used by those on the right, and its typically either a) an easily falsifiable claim of verbal oppression or cultural marxism, or b) a defense of one's actually bigoted words when facing criticism, usually by those in the KKK and MRA.</comment>

<comment>And the left never gives a straight answer. Don't want to be pinned down.  :)</comment>

<comment>Answer to what? You didn't ask any questions.And why did you dodge my comment by playing little semantics games?</comment>

<comment>To say never is inaccurate. Many liberals, though, do talk in circles, being evasive, trying to explain but bringing more confusion.  And I think it's done purposefully. Don't like being brought under scrutiny. </comment>

<comment>What they mean by "political correctness" is what we otherwise think of as "politeness" or "civility."</comment>

<comment>At no time in my life have I been living in fear of political correctness, and Carson didn't have the slightest thing to do with that. (Though I do owe him for plenty of laughs.)</comment>

<comment>If not nominated Dr. Carson will host a whole lot of no voters and write-ins. I am 100% for Dr.Carson, but if it comes down to a choice between Trump or Clinton, lets just say I will never vote Trump.</comment>

<comment>Oh, but you must then, vote Trump. Sometimes we have to do what we don't want to do. If Trump holds fast to some stuff he says, even though he is a maniac, that still beats Hillary. By far. If Carson ends up dropping out, I will vote Cruz, but what's crazy is, many Carson supporters will vote Trump.  And they are on total opposite ends of the spectrum. </comment>

<comment>I can practically hear someone saying, "Hey Sheila!! Where's that photo of Carson looking like a total goober?"</comment>

<comment>Could you be more specific? They are spoiled for choice...</comment>

<comment>It's hard finding a picture of him with his eyes open, so give them a break.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, they should wait until his face looks normal. Maybe his face looks more normal when he's talking at his weekly "Pyramid" club meeting.</comment>

<comment>If that was O they would be screaming racism</comment>

<comment>I've been told for months that ppl in Carsons campaign were put there only to sabatoge it from within. It was meant to destroy him from the beginning. If Carson ever did become prez, the whole gov would be exposed of the deception and changed. The Washington cartel definitely does not want that. Deception and trickery is rooted deep.</comment>

<comment>Oh, Carson's a ... victim.I see. (cough)</comment>

<comment>Coughing is bc ur choking on ur words. Jk. Trump is the one who speaks if being treated unfairly, he would run 3rd party. That's victim mentality. Never had to fight for anything. Has been handed a silver spoon. Carson made an observation, but has not bailed bc of it. Real men stand when when things are tough. </comment>

<comment>Consider withholding your vote from the nominee (Trump) and instead casting it for Carson even though he will be dropping out soon...</comment>

<comment>Carson never fought on a level playing field either--he is an affirmative action doctor.</comment>

<comment>What is an affirmative action doctor? is that like someone who has a quota of how many people of each race he'll treat? You make no sense.</comment>

<comment>Liam might be choking on the words, but you can't even get the words out! Here in grownup-land we don't spell words as if we're texting our besties.</comment>

<comment>Do you feel better, now that you've ridiculed me? </comment>

<comment>Are you a bot?  Just wondering, 'cause your post looks rather random.</comment>

<comment>Victim of a hi-tech lynching of an uppity black man... obviously. (JK)</comment>

<comment>Look, I would have voted for Carson if he made it to the finals, but it's looking like he won't, so I'm not speaking from a hostile viewpoint. But how can he run the country if he can't run a campaign?</comment>

<comment>ppl are crooked, can't change that.  Carson has guts enough to deal with it w/out degrading anyone. Real leadership. If elected, Carson expose the trickery/deception in Washington. That's why ppl are coming against him so bad. No fluff and pretense with him. He WILL deal with Washington. </comment>

<comment>"If elected, Carson expose the trickery/deception in Washington."But he didn't see the trickery in his own campaign?</comment>

<comment>When he did, he dealt with it. Some things are a bit more obvious (Washington) bc we've been seeing it for years. Nonetheless, Carson is fighting for your rights and mine, even if ppl don't like him. </comment>

<comment>Are you kidding me? The worst grifters and incompetents are still inside his campaign. It was the most competent ones who bailed his sinking ship.</comment>

<comment>Who are they then and what did they do?</comment>

<comment>Carson's biggest character flaw is that he fails to recognize his own egregious shortcomings.  This man is not fit to run for Dog-Catcher, much less POTUS.</comment>

<comment>If Carson ever did become prez, the whole gov would be exposed of the deception and changed. Alex Jones much?</comment>

<comment>So, I take it your okay with how Washington is being run? And if you are, that's ok. That's ur right. </comment>

<comment>I take it you worry about chemtrails. That's also your right.Uh... i maen also ur right.</comment>

<comment>Maybe if Carson wasn't self-medicating he would have been more savvy to these saboteurs.</comment>

<comment>It was all the glyconutrients' fault!!!</comment>

<comment>who is going to prosecute them and on what charges?</comment>

<comment>Seems very odd that a person would let people run his campaign who were obviously trying to sabotage it.  The more likely explanation is that he's trying to cover up his own incompetence.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes we can trust people, only to find we've been stabbed in the back. Can happen to anyone, but, when it came to light, he dealt with it. </comment>

<comment>Except you said you've been hearing about it for months.  And you'd think he would have more grasp on where the money for his own campaign was going.  That he didn't is problematic, to say the least.</comment>

<comment>It was from people who I speak with personally. People whose politcal views can absolutely be trusted. Never publicized in main stream media that I seen, anyways. Carson has done well in dealing with his campaign. At least he has not turned a blind eye to it and let it continue. Besides, IF Carson was in the wrong, name one candidate who hasn't made any errors, whether by accident or purposefully. </comment>

<comment>If people not even connected with his campaign can see that it's corrupt, then people actually in the campaign should be able to see it too.  He turned a blind eye to it for many months.  Surely he wasn't ignorant of the media's questioning and the investigation into his campaign finances.  No one is saying Carson can't make mistakes, but to be this blindsided by something going on right under one's nose doesn't exactly speak of someone ready to take on the highest office in the nation.</comment>

<comment>Oftentimes, those on the outside can see more clearly than those in the midst of the fire. A leader MUST be able able to rely on trusted advisors. One man alone is not a know all, be all. I think he handled his campaign very admirably.  :)</comment>

<comment>Somehow I get the feeling you would think that regardless.</comment>

<comment>*stabbed in the belt buckle</comment>

<comment>Lol. Okay smarty pants</comment>

<comment>At least there's finally some explanation as to why he's still in the race.</comment>

<comment>Half of the GOP primaries candidacies were or are scams. This is literally a party of pyramid schemers.</comment>

<comment>That's why they "suspend " rather then "end" campaigns . People still get paid, and the candidate retains some discretion on use of funds</comment>

<comment>Who paid off Hillary's last massive campaign debts?  Hmm.</comment>

<comment>I kind of feel bad about Ben Carson.  He's clearly a brilliant man within his field - but I suspect that his scientific brilliance does not translate well to anything outside science.You really have to be a good generalist to be a good POTUS.</comment>

<comment>This race has nothing to do with his brilliance, but with our culture and how ppl are looking more for entertainment vs substance. </comment>

<comment>You're right, Carson was pretty damn entertaining.</comment>

<comment>"Brilliant" people do not need affirmative action.</comment>

<comment>Obama needed affirmative action - but I am not aware that Carson got any.In any event - look at his accomplishments compared to Obama. Carson was the first surgeon to successfully separate Siamese twins joined at the head.No white surgeon ever did that before.  Carson proved his brilliance and innovation in the field.Obama has never had an original idea in his entire life - he is merely a professional verbiage guy.</comment>

<comment>How does brain surgery translate to politics? Obama ran several successful campaigns and is currently living in the white house.  Carson is running a campaign that does nothing more than steal money from people who think he is actually running for office. Why not try an objective apples to apples comparison of Obama to Carson's relevant accomplishments and get back to us with the results.</comment>

<comment>Obama did not accomplish anything except having a pleasant appearance and speaking voice - and being mixed-race, to give average Ellen and Oprah-watching middle Americans some comfort zone feelings.</comment>

<comment>> Obama did not accomplish anything except having a pleasant appearance and speaking voiceHow does an adult only accomplish that? Stop being a liar.</comment>

<comment>So one for Obama and none for Carson?</comment>

<comment>Times elected to the US presidency...Obama: 2Carson: 0</comment>

<comment>Scalia was an affirmative action appointee.</comment>

<comment>9/11 was an affirmative action job.</comment>

<comment>Carson is unaware of his own mental illness?  His ego is so outsized, he actually thinks that he has the knowledge, wisdom, judgment, experience and temperament to be President of the United States... Dr. Carson suffers from chronic and untreated megalomania.</comment>

<comment>His understanding of the brain doesn't even really seem to translate into an understanding of science.</comment>

<comment>You just told the world that you don't know science from the hole in your rear end.</comment>

<comment>No, I didn't.  Carson understands the brain far more than almost everyone else on the planet. That doesn't mean he understand science.  If Carson understood science, he would not believe that the pyramids are for grain storage.</comment>

<comment>Interesting... How about practical scientific achievements that defied the impossible? How about 67 honorary doctorates. Does that count for reason? When was the last time you formulated a theory to challenge a bunch of kids to do their own thinking and go beyond the expected. To me, that's what he did decades ago when he made the comments on the pyramids. Unfortunately, today's "rational" people see it as lunacy. Our country deserves better than that. If people would actually "listen" to what someone has to say, we would not be in this condition as a Country. Grow up you people!! Value individuals for what the are/live by, what hey have accomplished, not only for what they say! Just saying...</comment>

<comment>Plenty of celebrities get honorary doctorates. Note the adjective "honorary" preceding the title. How does Carson's grifting for a scam cancer cure fit into this wonderful vision you have of him, anyway?</comment>

<comment>The short answer to your question is :  It worked for him, nothing wrong about that. Here is what he said: “within about three weeks my symptoms went away.” Based on his answer I don't think would conclude that this supplement cured his cancer. In fact, he had to have surgery subsequently. Bottom line is, you can't blame someone, especially someone with medical background for taking something that is perceived to be good for that person. That doesn't mean he claims that it cures any cancer or any of the companies claims, leading to the eventual lawsuit. He has never sold the product or received compensation for marketing it. If you are in medicine like I am, you encounter many patients who can swear that whatever supplement they are taking, makes them feel better. Nothing wrong with that. Health supplements is a multibillionaire industry in this country and just like this product, it is not nearly as regulated by the FDA as pure pharmacological agents.</comment>

<comment>Actually, this happens all the time. There's still some debate whether Carson's being serious about the 2016 race, but just because you're an expert in one field doesn't mean that you'll be an expert in others:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmw...</comment>

<comment>Is this any more convincing?---Carson is far more accomplished than any candidate running for president. You must not have a clue as to this man's background. -Dr. Ben Carson has shown his generosity in selflessly giving to the world his entire life & all the lies the media told about him have been proven to be lies. His contributions & service to others, his generosity to the world & his depth of character are indisputable. Dr Carson's accomplishments listed below epitomize this man's leadership abilities, his brilliance & wisdom & they reveal the strength & resolve that he could bring to this White House & to the American people.(this is an incomplete list)-Dr. Carson was awarded 60 honorary doctorate degrees & merit citations -He authored over 100 neurosurgical publications -Dr Carson was the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University for 30 years-The President of the United States awarded Carson with the nation's highest civilian award, "the presidential medal of freedom" in 2008-He was selected as one of 89 "living legends" by the US Library of Congress CNN and TIME Magazine awarded him as one of the "top 20 foremost scientists" in 2001 -Carson was named "one of America's best leaders" by US news and world report in 2008 -He received an award for "the greatest public service benefiting the disadvantaged" by Jefferson Awards in 2000 -Gallup ranked Carson 6th on the list of "the most admired men in the world" in 2014 -Carson was appointed to serve on the Presidents Council on bioethics 2004-Carson was awarded "the William E Simon prize for philanthropic leadership" in 2005 -He received the Spingarn medal from the NAACP, their highest honor for outstanding achievement-He was awarded the Ford's theater "Lincoln medal for exemplifying the qualities embodied by President Abraham Lincoln, including courage, integrity, tolerance, equality and creative expression through superior achievements", awarded by Ford's theater society in 2008-Carson is considered the best pediatric brain surgeon in history & changed the way neurosurgeries are performed -Not only did he separate conjoined twins at the head, something never thought possible, he also designed the entire surgery himself -Dr Carson also did brain surgery on fetuses while they were still inside their mother's womb, something else that had never been done & never thought possible He pioneered & designed that surgery too.-Carson worked on the board for both Kellogg's and Costco each for almost 20 years-He started a scholarship fund donating an incredible amount of his own money & now it is nationwide & Dr Carson has sent thousands of young people to college.---Pretty diverse resume. There is a lot more...</comment>

<comment>That's exactly my point. Carson should've stuck to doing medicine and perhaps some philanthropy on the side. Again, he doesn't seem to have any political or governing experience that's a necessary condition for the Presidency. And for a brilliant surgeon, the fact that he doesn't support evolution is all the more troubling for our nation's educational and science policies.</comment>

<comment>Political experience? Nah...Has not worked for decades in this Country's leaders. What makes you think it will work this time?  Governing experience? Try convincing >80% of GOP voters according to national polls.</comment>

<comment>I can't even tell if you're being serious right now or if you're just trolling me. This defies the imagination. That's like saying that you don't need any flying hours or training to be a Navy top gun, and that only popularity points with your superiors is enough, for example. And more to the point, you do realize that.a) Even if Carson managed to convince ">80% of GOP voters according to national polls", that's still not a sufficiently random and large sample to ensure statistical and political robustness. There's also that thing about independent and democratic voters toob) There have been past Presidents who won by landslide margins who ultimately tunred out to be horrible leaders. James Buchanan, for instance, is widely regarded as the worst President ever, according to most historians/political scientists, and yet he won a landslide victory in 1856. Nixon also won in a landslide in 1972, and well, see where that got him!</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, no trolling. When I said >80% of the GOP voters I meant that four out of five remaining candidates have no governing experience. The governor, still a politician. If you have been paying attention to this election cycle, America is angry at politics as usual. We the people have to do our best at choosing  a candidate that has the right qualities as a leader. Looking at his/her proposals might help you decide based on your understanding/knowledge of different topics. You and I may disagree who that is, but ultimately it is America's choice. No practice here. I don't know of any of the current candidates with "Flying hours" as POTUS, not even VP. It's going to be a matter of time to determine whether America made the right choice or not and I do not think we can predict that. We can only do our best. Thank God we live in a free country and it's only four years before we get to choose again.I wish you the best and may your vote be the right one.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, same to you. But realize that you're playing a very dangerous game when you elect someone without the appropriate experience for political office. Just because you're good at one thing doesn't mean you'll be good at another, after all.History's replete with examples of this. There are some exceptions, like with Mike Bloomberg, but on the whole, the record doesn't look so good. For instance, even though this is an extreme case, Mao Zedong was a great guerrilla leader, political theorist, and demagogue, but he ended up being a crappy leader who directly/indirectly killed 30-70 million people. And the "flying hours" comment was in reference to the fact that to be a Navy fighter pilot, you need to have a set amount of experience to qualify first. Go draw your own analogies from there.Look, I get the fact that you're pissed about the state of American politics so far. I feel the same way at times. But this doesn't mean that electing someone who doesn't have a clue what they're doing is the best option going forward. At least Bernie Sanders has served for decades in the Senate and has deep insights into political office, and yet he thinks differently from the washington establishment. That's what makes him the best "outsider" in my opinion.</comment>

<comment>I respect your opinion and we'll see what happens.</comment>

<comment>Same. Just be aware that brilliance in one field doesn't necessarily translate into brilliance in another.</comment>

<comment>I respect your opinion. If you look at the previously posted abbreviated list of accomplishments, you can tell that his leadership/moral qualities like the Presidential medal of freedom, years sitting at the board up to morally opposed successful companies like Costco and Kellogg, etc., you can tell he achieved those not by just being a good neurosurgeon. Thank you for your insight. </comment>

<comment>Both down in the running for that "award" now.</comment>

<comment>Which award?</comment>

<comment>Hard to blame any minority individualthat doesn't "support" the theory of evolution, given it's founding literature's full title.</comment>

<comment>Meaning?</comment>

<comment>"On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life"I fail to see how that would lead a minority to not support a widely scientifically accepted theory. </comment>

<comment>Bill Cosby had 57 honorary degrees.  Honorary degrees are meaningless.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, I agree honorary degrees may not be as useful qualifications for certain positions. However, here is a posted list of other achievements/accomplishment that may be useful to determine the character, leadership ability of this individual. I think Bill Cosby might come short of being qualified for POTUS------ -He authored over 100 neurosurgical publications -Dr Carson was the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University for 30 years-The President of the United States awarded Carson with the nation's highest civilian award, "the presidential medal of freedom" in 2008-He was selected as one of 89 "living legends" by the US Library of Congress CNN and TIME Magazine awarded him as one of the "top 20 foremost scientists" in 2001 -Carson was named "one of America's best leaders" by US news and world report in 2008 -He received an award for "the greatest public service benefiting the disadvantaged" by Jefferson Awards in 2000 -Gallup ranked Carson 6th on the list of "the most admired men in the world" in 2014 -Carson was appointed to serve on the Presidents Council on bioethics 2004-Carson was awarded "the William E Simon prize for philanthropic leadership" in 2005 -He received the Spingarn medal from the NAACP, their highest honor for outstanding achievement-He was awarded the Ford's theater "Lincoln medal for exemplifying the qualities embodied by President Abraham Lincoln, including courage, integrity, tolerance, equality and creative expression through superior achievements", awarded by Ford's theater society in 2008-Carson is considered the best pediatric brain surgeon in history & changed the way neurosurgeries are performed -Not only did he separate conjoined twins at the head, something never thought possible, he also designed the entire surgery himself -Dr Carson also did brain surgery on fetuses while they were still inside their mother's womb, something else that had never been done & never thought possible He pioneered & designed that surgery too.-Carson worked on the board for both Kellogg's and Costco each for almost 20 years-He started a scholarship fund donating an incredible amount of his own money & now it is nationwide & Dr Carson has sent thousands of young people to college.juliettejet----In my opinion, above all, this election should be about character and the fruit of accomplishments. If someone wants to judge him on the basis of the pyramid statement, there is much to be desired about that way of limited thinking. That's just my opinion.</comment>

<comment>Aren't you claiming that Obama's only accomplishment was being mixed race?And here are critical of another person's intelligence?Can you not see the irony/hypocrisy in that?  Or you just let the TV do the thinking and you just repeat the mantra?</comment>

<comment>Much like engineering, you don't really need to know science to use the results that come from it. Do you need to know assembly code to use a computer?</comment>

<comment>If he thinks that someone without political/governance experience is fit to be President, then it's only fair that someone without an MD or surgical experience should operate on his brain. Maybe then he'll finally think straight.</comment>

<comment>This post might clarify your apparent ignorance---Carson is far more accomplished than any candidate running for president. You must not have a clue as to this man's background. -Dr. Ben Carson has shown his generosity in selflessly giving to the world his entire life & all the lies the media told about him have been proven to be lies. His contributions & service to others, his generosity to the world & his depth of character are indisputable.

It is a gift to us that this exemplary man is running for president of the United States. And even after all the lies that the media & the political elites continue to spread it seems that people are waking up -The Washington Post came out with a brand-new poll showing Dr. Carson in 1st place in favorability ratings nationally. Please do your research to learn about this man & his plans for the future of this country...Juliettejet----Generalist enough?</comment>

<comment>Carson sounds like he would make an absolutely brilliant surgeon!</comment>

<comment>That just makes me more confused as to why he ran for president in the first place. The man had widespread admiration from all corners, (even Killer Mike has pictures of Dr. Carson in his house) yet he decided to alienate and make a fool of himself in the minds of over the half the population (as well as internationally, trust me Americans, the entire English speaking world is following this horse race cum circus)</comment>

<comment>You're going to have to be more specific. People's perception of what somebody says can be distorted by ideology, prejudice, bigotry, etc. He's been a victim of all of these.</comment>

<comment>Clearly, you hold Carson in high esteem. Good for you. Perhaps that level of adoration blinds you to his weakness in the political arena. All of the truly magnificent accomplishments you cite are related to his tremendous skill as a surgeon. At that, he does has gifted hands. Unfortunately for his presidential hopes, he has revealed time and again that he's in over his head.</comment>

<comment>Carson was doing well, but he doesn't have the personality to deflect the media attacks on his bio.</comment>

<comment>I think ur right. That will solely depend on American people to see right thru the  media's agenda. </comment>

<comment>"Carson was doing well, but he doesn't have [a] personality."Fixed that for you.</comment>

<comment>As an athiest, I chuckle at the thought of all of those poor Sky Fairy cultists who gave their dollars to this scam headed by a man who didn't even recognize it as a scam...</comment>

<comment>Friendly tip from another atheist--it's spelled with ei, not ie :)</comment>

<comment>He is athier than thou.</comment>

<comment>How ELSE can a first time candidate raise money?He doesn't have the luxury of large donors so every time he gets a donation a portion of it has to be reinvested.How many TV commercials do you see for Dr.Carson vs the others?O'Reilly,Wallace and many others predicted he would fail and have done everything they could to help make that come true.Is Cruz going to beat Trump?Rubio?No way,regardless of who drops out.If the Republicans lined up behind Ben would he not have just as good a chance?Nobody ever tells Cruz and Rubio to drop out.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is telling Rubio and Cruz to drop out because they both have over 20% of the vote. Once Kasich and Carson drop out, people will turn their attention to the next in line with bad numbers. First things first.</comment>

<comment>Right.  Americans are smarter than Carson figured; they are not falling for the scam in huge numbers, as he had hoped.  At some point, Carson will fold his tent, call a press conference to blame everyone else but himself for his dismal failure, and then he'll go home, to his mansion and the 67 honorary college degrees he has mounted, framed and on display there.Like Clarence Thomas, Carson will characterize his defeat as a high tech lynching of an uppity black man.</comment>

<comment>I agreed with you right up to your last line. I do not recall Carson ever playing the race card and rather doubt he will as he exits stage right.- and as to the characterization of "defeat" ala Clarence Thomas, exactly what defeat of Thomas' are we referring to? Last time I checked he was entrenched-for-life on the "winning" side of the ledger</comment>

<comment>Clarence Thomas used the phrase, "hi-tech lynching of an uppity black man", at his controversial confirmation hearings... when it looked like the Anita Hill scandal was going to bring him down,  he played the race card and it worked.. after that blistering remark, he was quickly confirmed.Carson will follow suit, but unlike Thomas, it will be curtains for Carson's political career.</comment>

<comment>The issue isn't that he is reinvesting his money. It is that he is using the campaign as a front to collect money he is using to employ friends and family. Carson must know that he can't win the primary. He just isn't gonna quit until he's bled every last dollar from the rubes that are his supporters.</comment>

<comment>I think you give him too much credit.  From watching him, I think he was duped as far as the campaign finances go.  The book is a non-issue since noobs always do that.</comment>

<comment>Palin fleeced her donors by telling them she was considering a run in 2012. More about being sleazy than smart.</comment>

<comment>Obama also had a book come out when he was running, "Dreams of My Father."</comment>

<comment>Actually, Dreams from My Father came out in 1995, 13 years before he ran for president. Change We Can Believe In came out in 2008 and is a pretty typical campaign book.</comment>

<comment>Oh, thanks for the update.</comment>

<comment>When I look at Dr. Carson's campaign, three words come to mind: Sham. Scam. Flimflam.Carson jumped into the race because the GOP needs a token Negro presidential candidate these days, to give the illusion of tolerance and plurality to a political party dominated by Southern white bigots.Herman Cain performed the Uncle Tom role in 2012; Carson got the gig for the 2016 campaign.  Nothing more to it than that; but nothing less than that as well.Living the high life and peddling his book, Carson will stay in the race as long as he can spend other people's money; he's scamming the Grand Old Party and those bigots who are supporting his phony campaign... and he does it all while playing the Jesus card... what a sleaze!</comment>

<comment>Yep, I was thinking that Carson looks like he's "Ben Token".</comment>

<comment>More like Been Tokin', amirite?No but seriously, how many Xans does he pop before a public appearance?</comment>

<comment>Why is Carson even running?  For real?  A man of his intelligence clearly would have known from the get go that he was never going to be President.  Furthermore, even if he was that deluded in the beginning clearly by Iowa he would have seen the writing on the wall...what is the point of all of this?</comment>

<comment>Because he realized he can make a ton of money selling books and giving speeches.</comment>

<comment>Jeez...So Carson got grifted by his own grift?WTF?!How is he possible a presidential contender with this track record?</comment>

<comment>You drive Uber for a living.</comment>

<comment>I like Carson.</comment>
