<comment>We simply cannot trust the Congress, Republican or Democrat, to spend the money that they collect on the things they say they will.To paraphrase Joe Wilson, THEY LIE!</comment>

<comment>And who wants to pay more for gas anyways?</comment>

<comment>Bush and Cheney would like a word with you....</comment>

<comment>You mean as opposed to,the guy who actually said he'd like to see an increase in gas prices?https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=...</comment>

<comment>I actually agree with you.  I'd like to see an oil tax that gets passed through, dollar for dollar, to reduce other taxes.  Otherwise they'll spend it all on bailing out banks and killing Muslims.</comment>

<comment>The oil tax is vital to pay for past wars.  We still are being taxed for WW1 on our phone bills.</comment>

<comment>They should have a very large statue of him on the Washington Mall taking a dump on Obama's face.</comment>

<comment>Same old story. Not only does the federal govt PIG want more $$$, they want a bigger piece of the pie. STARVE THE BASTARDS!</comment>

<comment>I would make it even higher. The benefits:-Infrastructure improvements - although pork barrel will have to be watched-Encourage more fuel efficient vehicles-Help contain climate change</comment>

<comment>You have the mistaken idea that the federal govt is competent...</comment>

<comment>The reality:The money would be wasted buying votes by giving away "free stuff".People would still buy SUV's and pickup trucks.US manufacturing would become less competitive in international trade.Poor people would heat their homes burning wood, coal etc - more global warming, not less.</comment>

<comment>starve the city, county, state, and federal government that provides you public goods and services you count on and want every day.  got it.  brilliant.</comment>

<comment>Is federal spending higher or lower than it was in 2013?</comment>

<comment>slightly higher at $3.8 tr in 2015 vs. $3.5 tr in 2013.  To nubwaxer, the US spends more per capita on healthcare than any other nation...by transitive property, we could probably spend less and still achieve European style care. The same story holds true for education. So, I have to ask, why do we need to increase our spending? Can't we just spend it more efficiently?</comment>

<comment>I am all for more efficient government spending, but comparing European and American healthcare costs to outcomes is not as straightforward as everyone keeps making it out to be. The problem is that (1) fixed costs of healthcare innovation are incredibly high, while the marginal costs are super low, and (2) Europeans get all the same ailments as Americans. Thus, the profits generated in the US free market system subsidize the European healthcare system massively. If the US stops giving so many profits to health care innovators, then European care standards will drop. I am not saying that it isn't worth it, but I am saying that direct comparison is unfair.</comment>

<comment>But doesn't it cost more to do business here in the US than other places?</comment>

<comment>US health care costs more because the US does not price fix and does not limit care.  As an example, if the cost of treatment for grandma in the UK exceeds the QALY, treatment is denied.  The US has not had this healthcare conversation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>We cant have that conversation lol.  That's the death panels lol</comment>

<comment>Not every American has bought into the Statist BS that they must turn to the government for common 'goods and services', like they do in Russia.</comment>

<comment>Unlike you and you ilk, I don't depend on the federal govt for my "goods and services". And, apparently you have difficulty comprehending. Nowhere did I mention "city, county, state". Liberal govt-teat-suckers apparently have too many mommies. They can't even keep track of them.</comment>

<comment>"public goods"?What does that even mean and in what way does the government "provide" them?</comment>

<comment>Yeah the oil companies are crying now but what about all those years with record profit quarters? Did they spend all the money on hookers and blow?</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>Sounds similar to the Secret Service</comment>

<comment>That's trickle-down economics at its finest!</comment>

<comment>A good portion of the profit goes into stock dividends and back into the company for capital investments.</comment>

<comment>Another Obama fairy tale...good luck with that - NOT!Can't wait until the dictator is gone.</comment>

<comment>So, as the infrastructure continues to crumble, what is your solution to generate revenue?</comment>

<comment>The infrastructure is so bad  .My car fell into a big pothole and I had to walk home.</comment>

<comment>So you believe we can't move forward without 'generating more revenue', how about living within our means, not every 'want' has to be covered by government spending!</comment>

<comment>Infrastructure is a necessity, not a luxury. Crumbling roads & bridges have a direct impact on the economy.</comment>

<comment>We've had record revenue collections the past several years.  Or biggest problem is our political overlords have a spending problem.</comment>

<comment>Infrastructure has more than enough money. The reason stuff is crumbling is fixing extant roads, bridges, etc isn't something you can make a campaign ad from. It isn't "sexy" so money is wastes on worthless things like light rail and bridges to nowhere. Then you have unions, envrionuts and NIMBYs standing in the way of any attempt at useful maintenance and upgrades.</comment>

<comment>By definition, a dictator wouldn't ask Congress to pass a bill for a gas tax.</comment>

<comment>Right, he would just veto Keystone, break the sanctions on Iran, and take action in Libya. Just keeping the sight clear here. Obama is just 3 away from surpassing Bush in total executive orders.</comment>

<comment>Obama has 228 executive orders.  WBush had 291.  Reagan had 381.  FDR had 3,721.  http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu...Regarding Libya--I agree with you--but there is considerable legal debate regarding possible violations of the War Powers Act--but numerous military interventions by Reagan, Clinton, Bush, and Bush are also possible violations of the War Powers Act:  http://fas.org/man/crs/RL32267...</comment>

<comment>The dictator who can't impose his tax policy even with an army of jackbooted thugs?  Can't get good dictators these days...</comment>

<comment>Infrastructure...I have an idea! Let's spend A TRILLION DOLLARS on a great infrastructure stimulus. That'll work, right?Oh wait. Tried that. Built million dollar concrete toilets in remote Alaskan national parks.Ahhh....government.</comment>

<comment>Spending it on infrastructure is better than spending it on the military.</comment>

<comment>Um...no.</comment>

<comment>But that's what provides the military with something worth defending.</comment>

<comment>Some of those projects are still waiting for environmental go aheads, permissions, etc.</comment>

<comment>Those were the "shovel ready" jobs Obama was touting...what was it.....6-7 years ago weren't they?Down  in Fort Pierce Florida part of that so-called stimulus money was used to build a bridge. A one lane bridge that led from a field, across a ditch and into some woods.I kid you not. I watched it go up and questioned the county recreation department about it, being told that it was part of a new "coastal bike trail that we can all enjoy". Grant money. Here we are 6 years later and it's still a bridge crossing a ditch from an empty field into some woods.Government cannot be trusted to handle our money in good faith.</comment>

<comment>I'm shocked to see a left wing progressive wanting to raise taxes.</comment>

<comment>fix the roads?  fix the bridges?  crazy, i know. how dare that damn obama make a timely and practical proposal.  it's an outrage.  impeach!</comment>

<comment>How about we just use the F-35 money... better than spending it on a plane that doesn't work</comment>

<comment>On of the very unfortunate reasons the F-35 will not go away is the defense agreements / contracts with other countries.  These agreements have conflicting design requirements (VTOL ) and are a big reason why the plan doesn't work in the first place.</comment>

<comment>You call doing this seven years after taking office "timely and practical"?Kooky.</comment>

<comment>I find it unlikely that it would just be "some" of the per-barrel oil tax being passed-on.  What I do find likely is those nice little stickers one sees at the pump saying the price includes this much of federal, state and local tax won't show it.Given that it will be passed-on, even if only in part, I fail to see how it would be shared much more broadly - just how much oil is used for something other than transportation fuels?I'll go back to something I've suggested before - pick a goal for national fuel consumption - say how much was consumed in 1970.  Then for each year consumption remains above that level raise the federal fuels tax by five cents or five percent, whichever is greater.   And since the ultimate goal is how much fuel is consumed, not how many miles were driven, as the consumption drops, wind-down CAFE as a bone tossed to opposition.</comment>

<comment>Given that it will be passed-on, even if only in part, I fail to see how it would be shared much more broadly - just how much oil is used for something other than transportation fuels?Around 30-35%.</comment>

<comment>to what end?  what's your goal?</comment>

<comment>Mostly, to reduce the use of gasoline and diesel.  The "Why?" for that could be take your pick - it seems that many countries use oil to finance things of which we aren't terribly fond, so to help reduce consumption and so the price of oil on the world market.  Or, if you like, to stretch supplies available within the United States out further.  Or even, if you like, to be part of addressing climate change.</comment>

<comment>In favor of this in principle, but I'm curious as to the details.  Is this per barrel produced domestically?  Per barrel imported?  If the latter, would there be any measure to apply the tax to imported downstream products to prevent it from driving away domestic refiners (possibly in the long term)?</comment>

<comment>In other words, Obama gave up engaging Congress circa 2011.  He's the Commander in Chief of empty speeches and constitutionally-questionable Executive Orders.</comment>

<comment>Crude Tax = Good.  Otherwise we are going backwards on carbon consumption and efficiency ganes.Spending it on "big government projeccts" instead of paying down the deficit = pure waste.  Cash for clunkers.  Creation of entropy.Government pet projects is the biggest creators of entropy on earth.  This is not Bernie Sanders single payer health insurance.  This is a bunch of give-away contracts for public transportation, i.e. subway tunnels and train cars that we cannot afford as a nation with a $18 trillion national debt.</comment>

<comment>The article is bizarre.  Obviously, the time to raise an oil tax, if you are going to do that, is when the price of oil is very low.  Nobody is going to put up with a tax when prices are at historical highs. My prediction is that taxes will not be increased, because Reagan proved that deficits don't matter.</comment>

<comment>I'm glad that Obama trimmed the Federal budget, and created a surplus.  He did the US a service by cutting the national debt in half.</comment>

<comment>Fun Fact:The catastrophic global warming hypothesis (it doesn't even reach the level of theory) is not supported by any science and you will not find any poll of a credible organization that agrees that the ice caps are due to melt and New York is going to be underwater soon.People who say otherwise and claim consensus on the future climate of earth are selling something and if you look at their study or poll it will not actually be about a looming catastrophe or massive amounts of future warming</comment>

<comment>Fun Fact:It is, in fact, long since proven and supported by science... unless, of course, you consider a bunch of paid quacks scientists.</comment>

<comment>Maybe if Obama offered to sign the pipeline deal in return, he'd get some response from the Hill. After all the oil companies arent paying the tax the consumer is.</comment>

<comment>I am almost certain Obama doesnt know that about taxes.</comment>

<comment>This is a strange proposal to roll out right now. So why?Most of the infrastructure issues are because local and state governments have failed to spend money to maintain what they have. So why does this now suddenly become a federal initiative? And why is it coming from lame duck Obama?</comment>

<comment>Teh deficit! We have to stop the crushing deficit!  Except. Y doing things that raise revenue. We can never do that ever. Infrastructure is bad becuase Mexicans use it. Make Mexico pay for highways!</comment>

<comment>Here's a simple way to make this proposal more politically palatable:Know the old story about two kids arguing about which one of them gets the bigger slice of the cake? The solution: Let one kid slice the cake--but let the other kid pick the first slice.So, what we do with this proposal:The Dems take the lead to enact the tax.BUT the Republicans are given the lead in how to spend the money.That will mean more spending on infrastructure for rural areas (that lean Republican): Better highways and regional airports, expanded Internet broadband, etc. And less for mass transit that benefits Dems in cities.</comment>

<comment>I have to ask. What is the lefts fixation with infrastructure spending?  The US has plenty of infrastructure.  The US spends more as a percentage of the GDP on infrastructure than Europe.</comment>

<comment>Roads, elect. grid., water sply must be ok then.</comment>

<comment>Yes, they are OK.</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot.</comment>

<comment>That the best you have?</comment>

<comment>Just being concise and to the point.</comment>

<comment>You never have a point.</comment>

<comment>Derp.²</comment>

<comment>Tax the Chinese Imports not the oil. Probably the same in revenue anyway</comment>

<comment>Further proof (as if anyone needed it) that liberals don't understand economics.</comment>

<comment>Infrastructure pays for itself if you cut taxes! Why don't liberals understand this?  I</comment>

<comment>People like you should not vote. The US spends plenty on Infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>Well, if President Obama wants it Republicans surely don't. No matter how much sense anything he proposes makes they are against it. That is the bottom line with all of them. Remember John McCain's slogan of Country First? That is a joke. With this Congress for them it's country last obstructing President Obama comes first.</comment>

<comment>How come the US spends more money on Infrastructure/Education/Heathcare than Europe, yet we get worse results?</comment>

<comment>You tell me? We can't have that old European system here Republicans would lose their minds. Privatize everything and tax breaks for the rich that's they all they care about.</comment>

<comment>The European system is not old.</comment>

<comment>That was pure sarcasm.</comment>

<comment>If the bulk of this tax was intended to fund projects to reduce our dependence on oil rather than to perpetuate our unsustainable dependence on it by patching up our crumbling road system ... OK, that argument ain't gonna fly in our oil fixed world view.  Like with our drug dependency, we crap on the cartels while assigning no blame to our continuing love of travelin' down the hard roads to ruin and dropping loads of our hard earned savings into overpriced autos and trucks.  The opportunity cost to hell.</comment>

<comment>Our road system are not crumbling.</comment>

<comment>You don't live in Illinois.And, nice argument if you work for, or as a politician, getting kickbacks by way of political donations from the asphalt repaving industry.  </comment>

<comment>I live in a Red state with nice roads.</comment>

<comment>Whatever, you still rely on the largess of the federal tax payers.  Red bleeds a lot of blue.</comment>

<comment>How do know were our road funding comes from?</comment>

<comment>Every state gets a share of federal road taxes.</comment>

<comment>You mean we get the taxes that we promised for paying the tax?  </comment>

<comment>I at least admit I live in a welfare basket case.   In arkansas we talk big about individual liberty but we line up on command for that gubmint cheese lol.  We get more back than we pay in.  </comment>

<comment>So, Red states pay a gas tax when they buy gas?</comment>

<comment>Just most of the bridges along it.</comment>

<comment>Nope.</comment>

<comment>That the best you have?</comment>

<comment>It's much better than anything you have.</comment>

<comment>Derp.</comment>

<comment>I support taxes on drivers that pay for driving infrastructure (I'm a driver myself) but does the US import gasoline? I'd think a tax on Oil would favor importers of gasoline (if there are any) and in that case I'd be against that tax.  I think it would also unfairly hurt those who use oil for home heating, which is already less convenient and more expensive than natural gas.</comment>

<comment>IIIRC We already import a good portion of our gasoline as refineries are generally a very environmentally destructive process.</comment>

<comment>Gasoline is our biggest export, too.</comment>

<comment>Hey Barry, you know what you can do with your oil tax, you shit-colored sonofabitch.</comment>

<comment>Don't you have a knob to polish somewhere?</comment>

<comment>Sometimes I think that whenever Obama proposes a new way to tax us, he imagines that he can target it to only hit the people he chooses (then, he pictures a rich guy with a top hat and monocle).  In reality, this would be a horribly regressive tax.  And, no, poor people aren't all going to run out and buy Teslas.</comment>

<comment>Do you know what the worst part about Teslas is?  The cars are expensive and catered to the rich.  Yet, the rich get a tax break for buying one.https://www.teslamotors.com/su...</comment>

<comment>I really suspect obama never took micro 101 and macro 102 lol.</comment>

<comment>There are excellent ways to offset the regressive effect of energy taxes like those on petroleum products. Lots of other countries have applied these solutions successfully. But gasp they may lean slightly towards socialism.</comment>

<comment>Oil companies are publicly held, which means a per-barrell oil tax is paid by people who use gasoline and diesel (including those who ride buses) and all the pension and 401k retirement plans in the country.</comment>

<comment>Duh.  Still a good idea.  However I do see you took Econ 101.  No taxes are paid by producers.  It just superficially looks like it.  Those are factored into marginal cost of production.</comment>

<comment>It's a liberal mantra that they are going to shaft "the oil companies" - increasing taxes on them, eliminating the few minor breaks they get on those taxes (by using domestic vendors). None of those impact "the oil companies."All of those impact retirees and consumers.</comment>

<comment>Of course this will never pass since it spreads some of the cost of using oil beyond just us consumers, but 24 cents per gallon of oil isn't that much.  For the math impaired, that's 1000 cents divided by the 42 gallons of oil in a barrel (23.8 rounded up).  If 2/3 of that gallon goes to gas, that's 16 cents. The other 8 cents spread across the rest of the refined product.</comment>

<comment>So he wants to tax one of the shining lights of the post Great Recession economy, the US based oil industry? Brilliant, Obama.And lets be honest. The money would end up being diverted to pet projects that people don't use, like rail and mass transit. The money should be focused on roads and infrastructure related to air travel.</comment>

<comment>That is the best argument against it.  The money would just be wasted although in general rail and mass transit are not bad ideas.</comment>

<comment>Passenger rail is obsolete outside a few densely populated areas like greater NYC. </comment>

<comment>Actually that is the rare Obama good idea lol.  You would find few if any neutral macro economists who would oppose it.</comment>

<comment>I might be in support of this if the tax is time limited to a couple years and IF the laws are written so that the money must be spent on infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>Although this is not directly related to the story, I thought it was worth sharing since there is talk about Obama using executive power to raise taxes -- all by himself.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...SEN. BARACK OBAMA: I taught constitutional law for ten years. I take the Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we're facing right now have to do with George Bush trying to bring more and more power into the executive branch and not go through Congress at all, and that's what I intend to reverse when I'm president of the United States of America. (Townhall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, March 31, 2008)</comment>

<comment>That was before he had to confront a congress that votes no even to their own policy proposals the second Obama endorses them Everyone of the president's executive actions has been in direct response to Congresses's refusal  to do their jobs.</comment>

<comment>Just when you thought he couldn't do more economic damage.</comment>

<comment>Tax.....tax.....tax......then tax some more.And here I was hoping for change under President Doofus. Looks like just more progressive policies..........strangle and destroy America and its people.</comment>

<comment>If you want roads and bridges and want potholes filled you need to genetically engineer an infrastructure-fairy or tax something. Unfortunately the infrastructure-fairy would require destroying an embryo or two plus being supernatural would be prohibited by the Bible. So that's a non-starter. Taxes are a non-starter. Hmmm....So basically, the GOP is left with convincing America it needs to walk to work and swim across any rivers they encounter. HOLD IT - If no one is driving, because there are no roads and bridges, then they aren't emitting CO2 and that means endorsing global warming as real! OMG what is a Republican to do?</comment>

<comment>Our domestic oil and gas industry has has been one of America's primary economic engines over the last decade, even through the Great Recession. It even brought us to the brink of energy independence before being hit hard by the change in OPEC policy. Now with the industry fighting for survival, the guys in the White House want to finish the shut down of U.S. Production that Saudi Arabia started by imposing a new tax equal to approximately 1/3 the current price of oil. If our domestic producers are crippled beyond the point where they can make a quick recovery, Saudi Arabia and Russia will have the ability to create a major oil price spike at will.Jeff Dangeau www.dangeaulaw.comSee the following excerpt from the American Petroleum Institute website below for more on the economic impact of our oil and gas industry.When vast swaths of the U.S. economy were shedding jobs during the recession, employment growth in oil and natural gas industry professions was one of the bright spots in the economy. Why? Because of large innovations and larger investments in developing energy from shale. In the Marcellus Shale alone, between 2012 and 2013, there was a 40 percent increase in jobs in eight trades (union and non-union members included).Business consulting firm IHS has taken an in-depth look at the economic impacts of U.S. unconventional oil and natural gas development and found that the development of energy from shale and other tight formations supported 2.1 million jobs in 2012. With policy choices that support safe and responsible development the full unconventional value chain — the oil and natural gas industry’s upstream, midstream and downstream sectors and energy-related chemical industries — could support 3.3 million jobs by 2020 and nearly 3.9 million by 2025.With the right policies the U.S. is looking at significant job creation from energy developed with hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. This includes the oil and natural gas industry itself, sectors that support the industry with materials, supplies and equipment and areas that benefit as workers and families in these groups pay for housing and buy food, clothing and consumer goods.- See more at: http://www.americanenergyworks...</comment>

<comment>Interesting how the media focuses on the price of gas when people could instead focus on finding ethanol-free gas because ethanol might damage your vehicle:http://www.cartalk.com/content...Granted, that's E15 vs. E10, but why take a chance because repairs might cost more than the price of gas.I recently spent a long time trying to find ethanol-free gas, (there are two stations in my area), but be prepared to do your own research because http://www.pure-gas.org/ and http://www.buyrealgas.com/ are mostly out of date, and Google, other search engines, White Pages, Yellow Pages weren't helpful.I even contacted my state government, local state representative, and city government where one ethanol-free gas station is, but no one could answer my question, and so why are most Americans not aware enough to protect their assets?I called or emailed every resource I could think of:stations, companies, refineries, and the aviation and marine industries (bothsell ethanol-free gas, but not to the public).Refueling stations for small planes, boats, and race cars only use ethanol-free gas, and while there might be other or additional formulation differences compared to standard vehicle gas, I recommend researching both pro-ethanol and anti-ethanol sites.And heck your car manual, or if you don't have one, find it online and check the section on octane ratings; for my car, it said E15 will void the warranty, and while this may not apply to your vehicle, it’s worth confirming.</comment>
