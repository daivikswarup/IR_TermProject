<comment>As a scientist who was just laid off due to the current funding climate, I am glad to see a glimmer of hope.  I am searching for non-grant based positions because the current funding climate is so dire, continuing in grant-funded positions threatens my family's economic well-being.  I am glad I have been able to make a contribution to science, but may need to make a more prudent contribution to society going forward.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry that these tough times cost you a job. I hope that you find a good new position soon.My wife sits on NIH and NSF grant review panels. She says that the very low funding line keeps many worthy proposals out of the money. Program directors sparingly allot the funds they do have, like commanders of besieged cities cutting food rations.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your kind words.  I know it must be frustrating for your wife to have to make such tough decisions.</comment>
