<comment>If Cruz tried to pander to the base any harder, he'd have to surrender the ability to stand upright.</comment>

<comment>What in Cruz's record makes you think he's pandering and not a true beleiver in conservative principles? Agree with him or disagree, I think it's clear that the man is the real deal.</comment>

<comment>Well, there's the fact that his colleagues regard him as a "fraud" and "huckster" because he prefers self-promotion over effective conservative politics.  http://politicalticker.blogs.c... ; and seperately http://www.politico.com/story/...And there's also the fact that he was a Bushian "compassionate conservative" when that was popular before becoming a tea partier, and then a Trump clone -- all as dictated by political expedience.  http://www.gq.com/story/the-lo...The worst part is that he's a second rate huckster riding on the coattails of the Donald.</comment>

<comment>As very, very many conservatives would answer you, the politics of the GOP Establishment have been neither effective nor conservative these past five years.That's the main reason GOP voters are supporting outsiders so strongly this cycle.</comment>

<comment>That's the thing.  He's not even an outsider.  He spent very little time in private practice, where he represented political insiders like Boehner.  He joined the Bush campaign in 1999 and has been in out of politics ever since (the last 16 years).Outsider? Or a fraud posing as an outsider?</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is a fraud, a liar and a joke, perhaps moreso than other Republican candidates....but I don't make so much of a distinction between suicidal psychopaths and the people that support them...  The entire Republican party has lost interest in what's true, and that disqualifies them from leadership.climate.nasa.gov/scientific-co...</comment>

<comment>Outsider compared to the GOP DC Establishment, and thoroughly feared by it.</comment>

<comment>Not believing in science is a conservative principle?  I guess you are right.</comment>

<comment>It is the believers in AGW who are following the dictates of a priesthood.</comment>

<comment>Well name calling does a lot of good.  there are literally thousands of scientists who have studied relevant processes such as sea level rise, crop production, heat stress, etc.  How many of these did Cruz invite?  That would be zero.  Instead he invites the three scientists led by Judith Curry and the guy caught for accepting money for writing favorable results for the oil industry.  It seems that Cruz is really much more interested in a political point rather than any type of hearing.</comment>

<comment>When it comes to AGW, you believers can sure dish it out, but you can't take it at all, not a bit. You do know that Judith Curry was a universally respected climate scientist until she began to doubt the orthodoxy, don't you?‘I was tossed out of the tribe’: climate scientist Judith Curry interviewedhttp://new.spectator.co.uk/201...Hint: in science there is no orthodoxy, just data and theses which can be empirically falsified.But the AGW priesthood has turned climate change into an unfalsifiable thesis.</comment>

<comment>azt24 --I don't know how many scientific journals you have read or submitted articles to or for that matter edited.  I've done all three.  You seem painfully ignorant of the process.  There are pros and cons to the peer review system - but by and large it works better than any of the alternatives.Read this piece by Dr. Richard Muller - and tell me where he has falsified empirically or otherwise his findings. http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07...Be specific.</comment>

<comment>That NYT op-ed is not a scientific paper, and deals in assertions rather than proof. Dr. Muller refuses to address natural variability, the first hurdle for AGW. He says that he rejects solar variability for climate change, yet never says what exactly made the temperature go up 2.5 degrees F in 250 years. Surely he doesn't ascribe climate change from 1750 on to the early Industrial Revolution in England? So what was it that brought us out of the Little Ice Age, or put us into it, for that matter? He just baldly states that he thinks CO2 is the best fit, when actually it's a lousy fit. Temperature is subject to 30 year periodic oscillations which are not reflected in CO2 at all. The hottest decade of the 20th century was the 1930s durinig a period of low CO2 emissions due to the Great Depression. etc.Altogether, it makes strange reading. It reads more like someone reaching a predetermined conclusion for political reasons than a scientist stating his findings.</comment>

<comment>So I am going to assume you didn't read the article or that, perhaps, reading isn't your thing. You claim that he "never says" what made global surface temperatures rise, then almost immediately afterwards note that he actually does, in fact, state what he believes has caused temperatures to rise: carbon dioxide."The carbon dioxide curve gives a better match than anything else we’ve tried. Its magnitude is consistent with the calculated greenhouse effect — extra warming from trapped heat radiation. These facts don’t prove causality and they shouldn’t end skepticism, but they raise the bar: to be considered seriously, an alternative explanation must match the data at least as well as carbon dioxide does."What's more, your only alternative explanation is natural variation, or simply that nature happens, nothing to see here.No. It clearly reads like someone who entered the fray as a skeptic and whose "turnaround" is entirely attributable to a "careful and objective" review of the data. Altogether, it makes for interesting reading and challenges those like you, who continue to turn away from a similarly careful and objective review of the data, to present a more compelling alternative explanation.</comment>

<comment>I have to laugh at Cruz throwing in "satellite" measurements.  That certainly is interesting - but satellites actually don't measure temperature directly.Here's a good link https://www.skepticalscience.c...and a relevant quote....All three groups measuring temperatures of the troposphere show a warming trend. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program produced a study (pdf) in April 2006 on this topic. Lead authors included John Christy of UAH and Ben Santer of Lawrence Livermore National Labs. The first page has this quote:Previously reported discrepancies between the amount of warming near the surface and higher in the atmosphere have been used to challenge the reliability of climate models and the reality of human-induced global warming... This significant discrepancy no longer exists because errors in the satellite and radiosonde data have been identified and corrected. New data sets have also been developed that do not show such discrepancies."</comment>

<comment>"satellites actually don't measure temperature directly"They don't, huh?In that case, conventional thermometers "don't measure temperature directly", either.  They merely show how much a column of mercury has expanded.  [sigh]As for your quote, note that the discrepancy was reported by leading skeptic John Christy.  That was nine years ago and the discrepancy was corrected soon afterward.By contrast, when discrepancies are found in the raw vs. adjusted land-based data, NOAA fights to keep its methodology secret.  (Is it wise to base climate change policy on secret science?):https://www.washingtonpost.com...Meanwhile, the pause is now almost 19 years: http://www.climatedepot.com/20...</comment>

<comment>Abraham,I believe you have some misconceptions about thermometers.  Heat is actually "molecular motion" - absolute zero is defined as being when there is no molecular motion.  Kinetic energy causes molecular motion which causes expansion.  It works pretty linearly for gases and liquids. I'm personally more familiar with the type of silicon sensors that are used in ovens and drilling rigs - same type of Brownian motion is involved. This is really direct measurement in so far as kinetic energy in the material is measured by it's expansion or volt coefficients vs. current density.The satellite measurements that Sen. Cruz refers to are measuring the amount of radiation given off by oxygen in the troposphere.  Since you mention John Christy's papers from 1992 - maybe you'll want to look at Mears' papers from 2003 and 2005.As they say --- https://www.skepticalscience.c... ---"The original discrepancy is an excellent example of how science works and of critical thinking. With many different indicators showing warming, it did not make sense that the troposphere would be cooling. This discrepancy was taken very seriously by the scientific community, and the consistency and accuracy of all relevant data were examined intensely.Science advances by trial and error. The result is an increased knowledge of how to measure the temperature of the troposphere from space."Regarding Senator Lamar Smith wanting to review raw scientific data - please that stretches my credulity.  Raw data is raw data -- real world data needs a lot of statistical post processing typically to make sense.  I suppose the good Senator wants to start doing code reviews for IOS apps as well.Seriously - no one would turn raw data over to a hostile lawyer intent on a witch hunt.</comment>

<comment>Natural variation is another term for "nature does it in ways not well understood." It is a statement of humility about the nature of our understanding. If you have ever seen the chart of carbon dioxide against temperature over geologic timescales, you will see that something a whole lot more complicated must be going on, because the correlation is very low.http://wattsupwiththat.com/201...</comment>

<comment>azt24 -Dr. Muller's paper addresses statistical correlations - not causations.  The Little Ice Age occurred previous to the invention of the mercury thermometer - so one or two degree temperature variations are actually not recorded.You baldly say that CO2 is a lousy fit - without stating any correlation studies. Please provide a link that shows CO2 dropping during the Great Depression.Professionally speaking, your technical reviewing skills need some work.  They seem a bit emotionally driven by predetermined agendas rather than basis for further discussion in a collegial manner.BTW - did you notice that Ted Cruz talks about temperature measurements from "satellites"?  Who does that regarding earth temperature?  I believe that thermometers are much more common.  How long have satellites been in orbit to measure IR?  (Definitely not the Great Depression or the Little Ice Age).Ted's a very skilled debater and slips this stuff in...</comment>

<comment>On a first name basis with "Ted", are we now?</comment>

<comment>Thankfully not on a first name basis with Mr. Cruz.That does make me think having lawyers lecturing about scientific principles is probably less informative than having nuns teaching sex education.  </comment>

<comment>My humble apologies --- Senator Cruz is a skilled debater and slips the most amazing red herrings into his arguments.  BTW the temperature correlation with tropospheric oxygen radiation problem that Senator Cruz was alluding to was explained by Mears in 2005.I do like the avatar :-)Cheers,</comment>

<comment>If you're referring to this paper (http://www.sciencemag.org/cont..., then you & Sen. Cruz misunderstood Mears' research. He showed that measurement anomalies in satellite data need to be corrected out of the data to get an "apples to apples" understanding of global temperatures. Mears wasn't saying climate change doesn't exist.</comment>

<comment>Cruz was saying that satellite measurements showed cooling. Is thought I said Mears showed satelutodata to be consistent with warming once it was corrected for satellite position. </comment>

<comment>I believe you misunderstood what I said. Senator Cruz was saying that satellite measurement of tropospheric oxygen radiation over the last 18 years implied global cooling - based on a 1992 paper. While true if the 1992 paper is the only piece of evidence allowed by chairman Cruz... Mears in 2005 says that if you correct for satellite position satellite measurements agree with surface level temperature measurements.I have never said climate change doesn't exist - neither does Mears. Personally I'm a great fan of Richard Muller's statistical approach.Cheers,</comment>

<comment>You never did; Sen. Cruz denied climate change exists. Therefore, I don't believe anything the man says. He is a well spoken, highly intelligent but "in the pocket" voice for the oil industry. I have no use for him.</comment>

<comment>Not only do I like your avatar - but apparently we agree on Sen. Cruz. :-)That said - I think Sen. Cruz is a very good debater - quick on his feet - quick to shape a narrative based on limited evidence that is favorable to his cause.  He's very smart - hence arguing 7 cases in front of the Supreme Court.The above does not mean I like Ted Cruz - it means I consider him a highly intelligent cynical politician.  I find his disingenuousness to be truly scary.Cheer,</comment>

<comment>If correlation is not causation, then why all the fuss about rising CO2 levels?</comment>

<comment>azt24 --Adapting to correlated effects is a huge part of life - whether you recognize it or not.  For example "gravity" - Newton never said what causes gravity - only that he found equations that predicted planetary motion very accurately.  In other words, he found correlations between planetary motion and the positions of nearby planets.  We've worked with Newton's "laws" to good effect for the last 300+ years - without understanding causation.In my own retired life - take portfolio management.  John Bogle and others noted that "on the average" professional mutual fund management did not produce effects that outperformed the "market" as modeled by index funds. So he showed statistically, investors were better off using low fee index funds than high fee actively managed funds.  We all try to have a "diversified" portfolio.  How do you define diversification.  Bonds move in a somewhat negative correlation to equities.  All things are tied together.  William Sharpe mathematically defined diversification as "near-zero" correlation between asset classes.Do I need to know why active management doesn't outperform market averages?  No. I just act on the statistics. Do I need to know why certain asset classes are diversified? No. I can just use the statistics to guide my diversification choices.In my professional life - we relied on SPC (statistical process control) to improve manufacturing yields and bottom line profits.  Long term you would look at statistical correlations and try to determine root causation to look for improvements in new manufacturing processes.  But short term - you look to improve things first - then look for causation.</comment>

<comment>"on the average" professional mutual fund management did not produce effects that outperformed the "market" as picked by a chimpanzee.</comment>

<comment>Judith Curry is like a car mechanic who said she doesn't believe in oil changes.</comment>

<comment>Your proof that curry is legit is an interview with curry?</comment>

<comment>He believes in science..he does not believe in "climate change" science because its bullcrap.</comment>

<comment>When did the rejection of science become a "conservative principle"?As for "real deal", I do think Cruz is a dogmatic Con.  At the same time, however, he's an Ivy-educated, career politician who desperately dons an ill-fitting, "salt of the earth" costume whenever he leaves the house.  Smart guys trying to make themselves seem dumb are no less full of sh*t, than dumb guys trying eyewear to seem smart.  Not too "real" at all.</comment>

<comment>"When did the rejection of science become a "conservative principle"?"Since that agenda aligned with the political and business objectives of the chamber of commerce.</comment>

<comment>So then, when you say Cruz "is the real deal", you mean he's just a mouthpiece for more nefarious interests?I tend to disagree.  I am confident that Cruz is a "true believer".  To him, dogmatic, unquestioning belief is the only way to vindicate his minority points of view - otherwise, he'd have to acknowledge their - and his own - flaws.  Although everyone is sometimes wrong, guys like Cruz will never admit that because the value of learning from a mistake is less than the value of keeping the house of cards standing.If we look at his uber-originalist view of the Constitution, this becomes clear.  He had the view instilled as a child; being taught that the Constitution is like the Bible - literal, word for word truth, unmalleable and forever signifying a way of life that can never be recreated or even honestly viewed.  At a place like Harvard's law school, this immature understanding was challenged - not the least of which by the examples of the Consitution's contemporaries - and Cruz entrenched.  Although he's been losing this debate all his life, there is one way he can finally win it, and that requires a 1600 Pennsylvania address.</comment>

<comment>It should be clear to anyone with the slightest technical or scientific background that Ted Cruz does not understand the issue at all.  Thank goodness that Admiral Titley was there to try to help Cruz understand.  But, Cruz continues to reject the science for political reasons.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is a fraud.  The hearing he presided over that had Judith Curry, John Christy, William Happer and Mark Steyn as speakers is proof that Cruz is out to destroy the United States.  Global warming is real and it will have strong effects on the next couple of generations.  Ted will have blood on his hands.</comment>

<comment>I think he's shown pretty clearly that he'll say anything as long as it's in front of a camera.  This is the guy who said Chuck Hagel was working for the North Koreans.</comment>

<comment>No one who has the ability to read can believe in the Republican position on climate change. Conservative principals are keeping ones rice bowl full by pandering to the kochs.</comment>

<comment>In that case,  you are in the interesting position of arguing that a substantial minority of the responders in the Atlantic's comment section cannot read.</comment>

<comment>It accompanies stupidity.</comment>

<comment>If you think the average Atlantic reader is stupid, I have to wonder what you'd make of the folks I stood in line with at the dmv on Friday.</comment>

<comment>So depressing. Is there any Republican candidate with a brain that I can support?</comment>

<comment>Kasich, but the big problem with Kasich is that he has a brain. People don't want to hear the truth from someone with a brain, they want to hear someone tell them exactly what they want to hear regardless of whether it's true.The economic situation of most Americans is stagnating or has plummeted, they don't care about truth anymore; they want free market economics and gov't intervention to provide a middle class at any cost.</comment>

<comment>Drat those pesky voters. Who came up with this ridiculous concept of "democracy" when we elites know so much better, eh?</comment>

<comment>That's why we have a Constitutional Democracy and not a Majority of the Tyranny you seem to demand.</comment>

<comment>Kachich is a liberal panderer and you know it. He's the dims first choice when they lose.</comment>

<comment>It's a constitutional Republic. A democracy is in your words, a 'majority of tyranny.'</comment>

<comment>Hey, let's vote on whether AGW is real.  After that, maybe we can vote on evolution.  Or math.</comment>

<comment>I voted "no" on math. It's, like, hard and stuff!</comment>

<comment>Maybe we should put gun ownership up to a vote and see what happens.</comment>

<comment>Kasich has another problem: he's liberal. I really question whether he ever intended to win. I'm fairly sure Huckabee didn't.</comment>

<comment>The hiatus in the satellite data is held up as a magical talisman by skeptics in the fervent hope it will convince folks that the Earth is not warming.Of the unpleasant realities that most skeptics try to remain ignorant about are:1 - The best measure of whether the Earth is warming or not are the oceans.  They are unequivocal in what they show - substantial warming.2 - Skeptics love to criticize the adjustments to the surface temperature data - thereby first, showing that they have no understanding that ANY data from ANY instrument is adjusted (simple calibration is an adjustment), and second, showing that they do not understand that the satellite data that they love so much goes through adjustments that are far more complex than anything that happens to the surface data.Ted Cruz, in inviting four climate science skeptics and only one climate scientist that represented the consensus to his "inquiry", and the gish gallop he went through at the end, shows that he is well aware of skeptic talismans and their effect on the uninitiated.</comment>

<comment>Firstly, the disagreement is not about whether the Earth's average temperature changes, but whether human actions are the predominant cause and what, if anything, human intervention can actually solve. Being an agnostic on the issue who incidentally has a masters in Chemistry, all I can say is, to boil an extremely complex phenomenon with literally thousands of contributing variables down to the environmental chemistry of man-made greenhouse gases is extremely crude.Lastly, the science of climatology is not "definitive" as the trope goes because the philosophy of scientific inquiry isn't meant to ascertain certainty; the scientific method is used to disprove a null hypothesis, not prove the cause of a thesis. It's much like a sculptor constantly removes substrate (untruths) to reveal ever-closer approximations of his art (truth). Only in science, the finished work is never fully realized. Even simpler concepts like the certainty of Newtonian Laws are bound to be upended by Quantum Mechanics. And there is still so much we don't understand about our own Sun, the primary driver of Earth's thermodynamics. </comment>

<comment>Okay. But you can't claim that because the details are never completely nailed down, a general truth never emerges. You can tell whether the sculptor is making a man or a horse before the work is finished.</comment>

<comment>But if you need it to be a horse, and he is carving a man, then you declare its clearly a centaur, no doubt about it.</comment>

<comment>The wishes of Climate Deniers have no effect on reality.  That they seem to be confused about this suggests they are in a mentally and emotionally regressed state.Climate Denialism is a mental disorder.Humans are warming the planet.  That's the fact of the matter:climate.nasa.gov/scientific-co...</comment>

<comment>"Nooooooo! It's a centaur I tell you!"</comment>

<comment>That's a perfectcly fair point. But I was narrowly arguing only that the science isn't certain. It could very well be that the earth's carbon cycle plays the predominant role. Conversely, it could turn out that solar energy, which we know is not dispersed uniformly, is the principal cause. More likely, both are contributing factors and we simply don't know the relative contribution they individually make towards the phenomenon. But seeing as how the cross-sectional study of astrophysics and climatology is actually very "young" in context, I wouldn't be surprised if our current understanding is erroneous. Or metaphorically, we may not be far enough along to know whether we're looking at a horse or a man yet since we can't objectively "know what we don't know" yet. And the alarmist wing of the environmental movement has a contemptible track record on this very issue, among others.</comment>

<comment>Science isn't certain, but it's applicable. It's true that we can never know everything (or everything we don't know) -- but you're saying that we can't really know anything, that's different. We don't know everything there is to know about aerodynamics, but we will never discover that airplanes can't fly.We also know that carbon byproducts emerge from burning fossil fuels. We know that these byproducts have a heat-trapping effect on air masses. Therefore the atmosphere ought to be warming, the absence of that effect would be a scientific mystery.</comment>

<comment>Beyond saying that I agree with your first sentence, I will further say that it is also about being honest concerning what the entirety of data says and what it does not say.  And since you mention your educational level, I will also and state that I have a doctorate in physics. And since we are both scientifically educated, I am sure you can understand my frustration when I see folks like Cruz spin the science of which he has only minimal understanding.I will only further add that I am fully satisfied that the physical science is very clear that man is contributing to the warming we have experienced.  What constitutes the major research effort in climate science, and where the biggest rift is between skeptic scientists and consensus scientists, is what is the magnitude of the warming to be expected from the addition of CO2 to the atmosphere.  It is absolutely correct to say that this has not been adequately determined yet.  But our best science tells us clearly it is not zero.</comment>

<comment>And if people who are advocating policy change, in response to their views of the role of CO2 emissions, were as honest as you, on a consistent basis, then we may have ad a reasonable public debate. They chose not to be however, so what has been sown is distrust and cynicism.</comment>

<comment>Willallen, you have clearly not been paying attention to the discussion on both sides. Yes, environmentalists and scientists have had varying messages based on their interpretation of the facts but that was not dishonesty which you accuse them of. It is the very product of the scientific method. The real dishonesty has been the cabal of deniers funded by big oil and coal and their minions. Their deliberate efforts have prevented the reasonable public debate you call for.</comment>

<comment>Having Al Gore as your leading spokesperson didn't help did it?Ever count the lies in his documentary?</comment>

<comment>How is Mr Gore the leading spokesperson? Did you take a poll of your friends to anoint him to that position?Can I decide who’s the leading spokesperson of any position I disagree with and then attack the strawman that my decision generates?</comment>

<comment>That came out in 2006. It's time to get some new material.</comment>

<comment>lovemycountry1, you clearly can't read.</comment>

<comment>No, the real dishonesty is the cable of alarmists funded by big green who have convinced the public that paying a global tax can change the weather. Lol!</comment>

<comment>Bullcrap, it is the defamation of those who question the alarmist dogma. The destruction of careers, the denial of funding. That corruption of peer review. The   refusal to release data. That tells me only one thing, this is a cock up, it's not about "science" as the alarmists claim, it is politics, power and money. The "deniers" have nothing to prove, they are trying to have a discussion. It is the alarmists calling for persecution of the deniers. Why is that?</comment>

<comment>Conservative to (apparent) liberal, I have to say that what you are saying sounds to me like the most sensible view.I cringed when I saw what Cruz had done, because I like many things about him including his views on what drives elites of both parties, but I feel like he's getting so carried away by the Us vs. Them fearlessness that he's actively seeking polarizing issues, and taking the wrong side. I'm giving Christie a second look now, just because he pitched himself as the environmentalist, but "the environmentalist Republican" doesn't quite sell him as a whole.</comment>

<comment>The data says that the rate of warming prior to 1950 was very similar to the rate of warming post 1950.  Despite the massive c02 increase of at least 5x. We weren't emitting hardly any c02 prior to the post war industrial boom.   That warming wasn't from us.    And furthermore the rate clearly decreased during China's recent economic boom which is this "hiatus" that people keep talking about.This is environmentalists being alarmist and corrupt people taking advantage.  This might shock you but environmental studies professor are much more ideologically driven than a chemistry professor.  Look at how defensive and irrational they are when exposed to criticism.   </comment>

<comment>What if that unsupported assertion were true?Take a much broader view:If we haven't already emitted enough CO₂ to melt the polar ice sheets completely, why isn't there a single example in Earth's history of polar ice sheets withstanding CO₂ so high?climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/l...</comment>

<comment>Now you're just making stuff up joe.  Co2 concentrations are up from about 300ppm to about 400ppm...  Not 5x.  And warming has a time lag, which is a clear consensus of the basic physics, as well as the feedback effects.If you want to debate with made up info, we may as well say the sugarplum fairy is causing the earth to cool.</comment>

<comment>I concur. Although, even if CO2 theory was 100% correct, I do wonder what can be done about it given the world's geopolitical "climate." America can "lead" all day, but if we are the only ones replacing our economy, we will have little effect and would be kidding ourselves to think others will not exploit us. Fossil fuels are the economy and make our way of life possible. Period. Virtually nothing is unaffected by it. I just don't want to be the luddite who gets shot by Russians or Chinamen et al looking to steal our resources and continue a culture that maintains our quality of life that we generally take for granted.</comment>

<comment>None of which accounts for the rapid changes in our atmosphere that are easily explained by current human activity.  So yes, there are many unknowns, but it is willful ignorance to deny humans are driving the climate, today.</comment>

<comment>No, it's not definitive.  But since when do we require 100% certainty in anything to act? All major advancements in the 20th-21st century were based on theories that weren't "definitive." And policy is routinely based on probabilistic considerations.But anyhoo, you have a master's in chemistry and a dental degree.  So you're obviously the expert in climate science.</comment>

<comment>Yes, because being an admittedly unsure agnostic equates to my asserting expertise in climatology. Go easy with the butthurt, Mintberry Crunch.</comment>

<comment>Ah, yes, the good old "It's to complicated for me to understand" platitude.The certainty of Newton's mechanics wasn't "up ended" by Einstein's Special and General Relativity, nor is it "bound to be up ended" by quantum mechanics.The Sun is not the primary driver of Earth's thermodynamics. The "thermo" part is the result of of solar energy. The long term trend and decadal oscillations are the dynamic part and is the result of a handful of factors that include ocean heat exchange and greenhouse gasses, primarily CO2. The upward trend in global temperature is caused by CO2. The complicated part, the part that you find difficult to understand, the cycling of temperature about the mean trend is primarily the result of heat exchange with the oceans. Together, they account for some 75% of the variability in global mean temperature, with CO2 responsible for all the the upward trend at a rate of about degrees C per ppm-V CO2.The null hypothesis, for decades, has been "Global warming is = 0". The denial crowd has contributed immensely as they have failed to prove the null hypothesis. What they have proven is that they are negatively correlated with facts and science regarding global warming. In all, the level of certainty is remarkable given the nature of the problem.Contrary to your belief, the problem doesn't consist of "literally thousands of contributing variables".   The fundamental issue of human induced global warming is a rather simple problem because the Earth is a thermodynamically closed system.  There is no essential exchange of matter.  The singular source of energy is the sun, in the form of electromagnetic radiation.  As a closed thermodynamic system, the net energy gain is the difference between the energy incoming solar energy and the energy reflected and radiated back out again. The energy source is nearly constant.  This is either reflected or absorbed.  What is absorbed is then either radiated back out into space or stays.  As greenhouse gas concentrations increase, less is lost back into space.The amount of incoming radiation is practically constant and has no significant affect on the variability of global mean air and sea surface temperature.  Global mean air and sea surface temperature is only moderately more complex with a handful of factors that include green house gasses, aerosols, ocean heat exchange, solar irradiance, orbital mechanics, ozone, and land use.  All of the factors that affect the overall global mean air and sea surface temperature are measurable. As previously pointed out, GHGs are the single factor responsible for the upward trend.  The single greatest drive is CO2.  Of all of the remaining factor, ocean heat exchange is the single greatest factor driving the cycling about the trend.   For any given year, the global mean temperature can be accurately determined from the level of atmospheric CO2 and measures of ocean temperature cycles like PDO (mostly PDO).   The relationship isAnom = -122.7+0.00944*CO2+0.0804*PDO+.08793*TSI.This relationship is sufficient enough to make a reasonable determination of future temperatures through the next fifty years,  given the current rate of fossil fuel usage.The complexity only becomes significant at the distribution of heat withing the oceans and about the globe.  But the complexity of ocean and winds, which is the most dynamic part, is entirely internal to the Earth's closed system.  This is the part that is responsible for weather.  It can be summarized in the single practical thermodynamic law, PV=nRT.  This relationship is what drives ocean and wind currents as pressure and volume are proportional to temperature.  Temperature is the measure of internal energy of matter.  Temperature differences create differences in pressure.      Air moves from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure.   This is what we know as wind.  As the Earth rotates on it's axis, the Earth is warmer where the sun is shining and cooler where it is not.  But the complexity of weather patterns doesn't change the global mean temperature because the global mean covers the entire Earth.What human intervention can be done to solve it is as simple as it's cause.  The reduction of atmospheric CO2.It is unfortunate that your Master's degree in chemistry leaves you finding the science too complex.  The science, though, isn't dependent on your understanding of it.  You might start by getting the difference between the definition of "literally" and "figuratively".   I can guarantee that you have no actual listing and count of the number of variables and your assessment of the number of variables isn't "literally". It is, more "rhetorical" than anything.</comment>

<comment>"The null hypothesis, for decades, has been "Global warming is = 0". "That is simply false. The null hypothesis is "the climate varies for natural reasons not well understood"Talk about battling straw man arguments. So all you have to show is that temperatures have risen, and that is supposed to prove every AGW claim you make?</comment>

<comment>Idiocy.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention that the theory is based on computer models, which contain many assumptions which cannot be empirically measured, such as climate sensitivity to carbon forcing. So the theory can only be validated over time by models with good predicative power.So far, the models are flunking that test badly. The AGW cabal is responding with scientific fraud, literally rewriting the temperature record.</comment>

<comment>For global warming the null hypothesis is natural variability. You have to prove that current warming isn't part of a natural cycle, which is a high hurdle, since were have been in a warming cycle since the end of the Little Ice Age in the late 18th century or early 19th century, depending how you measure it, which is well before industrialization could possibly have influenced the climate.Frauds like Mann's Hockey Stick, which denied the existence of the Little Ice Age, do not inspire confidence.</comment>

<comment>Ari - are you aware of Richard Muller's approach to the AGW issue.  It doesn't rely on on simulation methodology (bidirectional feedback mechanisms - loosely coupled to other feedback mechanisms - in such as way as to make determination of cause and effect virtually impossible.)I find Muller's work compelling http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07...</comment>

<comment>Making hidden adjustments to raw data that  you refuse to make public so that others can replicate your work, which we have seen often in AGW circles (see: Phil Jones, Michael Mann) does not breed trust. The scientific method depends on experiments which can be reproduced.</comment>

<comment>Oooh. A master's in chemistry. You don't say.</comment>

<comment>Ah, yes. A chemist's convictions trump science. The link between climate change and our activities has been all be certain for some time. The incessant insistence from deniers that "the jury's still out" is ridiculous. Also, this hearing definitely was not simply doubting the A in AGW - they claimed that there has been no warming in 18 years. Oddly, they couldn't seem to make up their mind whether the Earth is actually warming, that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, or if the Earth IS warming, but that humans aren't involved. They can't even keep what they're denying straight.</comment>

<comment>It just made all the past predictions wrong and proved that man's contribution to climate change was overestimated by people like James Hansen.And when confronted with this reality you guys started denying the official data showing your lack of scientific method</comment>

<comment>"1 - The best measure of whether the Earth is warming or not are the oceans.  They are unequivocal in what they show - substantial warming."Best measure?  Yes.Unequivocal?  That's utter nonsense.  We don't have enough thermometer coverage to measure the oceans' temperature and probably never will.  The oceans are too vast and too deep.</comment>

<comment>Please show your scientific support for this assertion.</comment>

<comment>"2 - Skeptics love to criticize the adjustments to the surface temperature data - thereby first, showing that they have no understanding that ANY data from ANY instrument is adjusted"Oddly, those adjustments have the consistent effect of lowering old temperatures and raising recent temps.  And yet, NOAA refuses Congress's request for an explanation.It's foolish to base policy on secret science.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing secret about the science.  NOAA has provided data and methods to congress and scientists have testified twice on the research.  What Lamar Smith wants is emails.  This is a witch-hunt and nothing more.If you are so skeptical of adjustment (which are needed for all data), then you should also be skeptical of the adjustments that UAH makes to its satellite data sets.  They are typically huge compared to those done to the surface temperature data sets:http://moyhu.blogspot.com/2015...</comment>

<comment>The issue is not what is the best measure sir.  The issue is that the AGW models predicted atmospheric temperature increases that are not occurring.  The divergence  between the models (which are the sole basis of this "science") and the reality displays a fatal flaw in the models.You see, they are guessing at the climates sensitivity to CO2 and the models take that assumption and make predictions based on it.  Their assumptions are provably wrong.  The climate is not as sensitive as they predicted.There are just too many variables that go into the equation and to date, they have no idea.</comment>

<comment>When the question is: "Is the Earth warming?", then, yes, the best measurement IS the issue.  And since the reason that skeptics, like Cruz, love to talk about the hiatus is because they love to say it means that the Earth is not warming, then, yes, we have to talk about what is the best measure.With regards to models, skeptics also love to say that the models have over predicted the warming.  This type of thinking shows no nuanced understanding of the various things models are used for and how models don't predict future climate, but make projections of future climate based upon projections of future CO2 increases.  That is why when talking about models, one must say what scenario one is talking about.  The current temperatures have been fairly well replicated by a model Hansen used in 1988.http://moyhu.blogspot.com/2015...</comment>

<comment>Every model has diverged dratically over the last 18yrs from the actual amd most ate so far off as to be a joke.Even Hansen overestimated temp increase.  He project temps 4 times higher than actual.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz alongside his other climate change deniers have a problem with math. They rather believe the 3% of scientists that say climate change isn't real compared to the 97% of scientists who say it is. All Republicans appear to have more concern about leaving their kids and grandkids debt than what kind of planet they will be leaving them!</comment>

<comment>He doesn't have a problem with math at all. You are looking at the wrong numbers.Look at the percentage of Americans, that love big houses in the suburbs that need heating in the winter and AC in the summer, and a big truck and a SUV to go along with it,Would you like to take a stab at guessing what percentage of them want to reduce energy consumption?These people are not willing to change their lifestyles (much less loose the investment they made on it) better pretend that Climate Change is not happening, and if it is , then is a natural process that humans can't do anything about.</comment>

<comment>Those who live in denial of climate change also live in a parallel universe. End of discussion.</comment>

<comment>But it is a *happy* universe, and that's what keeps it going.  Sure, their children's children's children will hate them for what they did, but that is the future's problem.</comment>

<comment>Try telling GOP that as all they care about is leaving their  kids and grandkids debt.</comment>

<comment>I have no problem with that thought."Don't chop down the trees, or your house will get too hot and uncomfortable. Think of your grandkids!""If I don't chop down the trees, they'll auction the place to my neighbors, and my grandkids will have nothing."Still, I would like to achieve both goals if possible.</comment>

<comment>Republicans don't give a crap about debt.  The only reason they talk about debt now is because there is a Democrat in the White House and they can use the "debt" as an excuse to block his agenda.  You watch - if a Republican wins the White House in 2016 the deficit will balloon and the Republicans will all be talking about how "Reagan proved deficits don't matter" as per Dick Cheney on 12/6/2002.</comment>

<comment>Sorry maus, but you are posing a logical fallacy. Like millions of people that continued to smoke during the period when big tobacco was spewing lies about the clear dangers of smoking, people are confused and have no reason to change their behaviors. Also, the actions of the cabal of deniers has limited the real options people have had to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. You can't lie to people and then blame them for believing the lies as your excuse.</comment>

<comment>My point is that these people does not want to change, they want to be lied to. Given the option of voting for the one that lies to them o one that tells them the truth they will vote for the one that lies to them.Quick survey around the workplace... the ones that live 40 miles away and drive a full size truck, do not believe in global warming caused by humans. If you ask them the real problem is that the price of gasoline still too high.</comment>

<comment>The thing is, you could have a big house powered by solar and a big electric car if you wanted to. I'm not convinced we have to give up these things.</comment>

<comment>I guess that is the forth stage of denialism....1) Hell no! The the earth is not warming up.. it snowed yesterday...2) Yes it's warming up, but it's a natural cycle and humans  have nothing to do with.3) Yeah it's warming up, but it's all good, it will open up the Northwest Passage to navigation. Besides CO2 is good for plants.4) Yes it's warming up and it's bad, but technology is going to rescue us, so lets do nothing. Besides the Chinese are also big offenders  and they are doing nothing.</comment>

<comment>I don't see what the difference is though- if you are going to have a solar-powered house, size doesn't seem all that important.  There are a lot of infrastructure improvements that we could make as well, but they'll attract people, rather than force anyone to give anything up.  I mean, people are already moving back to cities because they're more fun to live in, and when you get good public transit people are going to jump on that.  Of course there will be some holdouts, but what are we going to do?</comment>

<comment>Seriously, dude? Show me how the UN honchos who just assembled in Paris to bloviate on climate change have lessened their carbon footprints, like ever.They just want to make the rest of us poor, while they jet around to five star hotels.</comment>

<comment>You still believe the 97% canard?</comment>

<comment>Anyone with a logical mind would believe 97% of scientists opinion over the other 3%! Apparently math and common sense doesn't come easy  for some.</comment>

<comment>Here is where that particularly bit of B.S. came from:The "97 percent" figure in the Zimmerman/Doran survey represents the views of only 79 respondents who listed climate science as an area of expertise and said they published more than half of their recent peer-reviewed papers on climate change. Seventy-nine scientists—of the 3,146 who responded to the survey—does not a consensus make.http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB...So, tell me what else you believe that you haven't done a lick of work on?</comment>

<comment>You will never convince those who deny climate change no matter what is said by those who know far more than the average citizen as they are the experts so this discussion is over.</comment>

<comment>Way to move those goalposts!Will you admit the 97% stat is B.S.?</comment>

<comment>Heck, if anything the actual percentage is probably higher.</comment>

<comment>No I won't just as you believe it is. End of discussion.</comment>

<comment>I provided you with evidence that the 97% claim is B.S.And, yet you cling to it.Why is that?  Is it because it's been repeated enough?  Or that Obama said it?These are the attitudes that inhibit discussion.  You guys are just as faith-based as those on the right.</comment>

<comment>Negatory.The 97% number is also supported by a 2013 study of 11,944 climate paper abstracts (specifically, of the papers taking a position, 97.1% supported AGW) and a survey of authors (1,200 responses, with 97.2% supporting AGW).  http://iopscience.iop.org/1748....A seperate 2013 study of 13,90 articles found an even greated consensus. http://www.jamespowell.org/Ori...Update thine talking points, por favor.</comment>

<comment>9 out of 10 dentists recommend trident. therefor the science is settled.</comment>

<comment>Considering that tenth dentist is claiming there is no trident, yes, for all practical purposes.  So, chew the gum until science knows better.</comment>

<comment>That stupid 97% number has been debunked over and over. http://www.forbes.com/sites/al...They asked a small self-selected set of scientists who published on AGW (during a period when skeptics weren't even allowed to publish, thanks to the East Anglia cabal) if they was a warming trend and human activity was mainly responsible. A vague, unquantified question that by no means supports the AGW alarmist program even if you agree.</comment>

<comment>Azt, please read what I wrote, and respond accordingly.  The opinion piece you cited doesn't address the studies I cited. You can't "debunk" something without addressing it.  Generally, you would be better served looking at the studies themselves rather than trusting an opinion writer.</comment>

<comment>I did read it, and I did respond. The surveys are fraudulent, because they claim far stronger support for alarmist AGW than they ever asked about.The list of peer-reviewed publications is not evidence because it has been deliberately skewed by a conspiracy among the editors. That has been proved by the very words of the editors themselves, not to mention the testimony of the scientists who have been prevented from publishing. Some of whom were held in high regard and well published, until they followed the data and developed doubts about AGW orthodoxy.Furthermore that 97% number would not prove anything even if it were true, because science does not work by consensus.</comment>

<comment>Actually, no: "Mr. Cook's work was quickly debunked. In Science and Education in August 2013, for example, David R. Legates (a professor of geography at the University of Delaware and former director of its Center for Climatic Research) and three coauthors reviewed the same papers as did Mr. Cook and found "only 41 papers—0.3 percent of all 11,944 abstracts or 1.0 percent of the 4,014 expressing an opinion, and not 97.1 percent—had been found to endorse" the claim that human activity is causing most of the current warming. Elsewhere, climate scientists including Craig Idso, Nicola Scafetta, Nir J. Shaviv and Nils- Axel Morner, whose research questions the alleged consensus, protested that Mr. Cook ignored or misrepresented their work."http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB...</comment>

<comment>I posed the same not realize you had done so</comment>

<comment> You are forgiven. 😄</comment>

<comment>Debt is in fact a more pressing dead-line. You don't give this view the credibility it deserves. I think that if American policy can save the fact that America is naturally beautiful and the fact that the world is naturally habitable, then it should. But don't pretend that prioritizing debt is stupid.</comment>

<comment>The 97% number is a fallacy: "the "97 percent" figure in the Zimmerman/Doran survey represents the views of only 79 respondents who listed climate science as an area of expertise and said they published more than half of their recent peer-reviewed papers on climate change. Seventy-nine scientists—of the 3,146 who responded to the survey—does not a consensus make." An interesting article on the subject in the Wall Street Journal --> http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB...</comment>

<comment>Conservatives do love their liberal and progressive conspiracy theories. I used to think it was a tactic to rile up the base, but now I think the Teapublicans have completely bought into the idea that these "conspiracies" are destroying America.The whole fight over whether the academic Journal "Science" cooked the books over their latest peer-reviewed climate change article is embarrassing as an American because there was no reason for it other than they disagreed with the science.</comment>

<comment>Well, you know the government created the AIDS and crack epidemic.  9-11 was inside job, and vaccines are a conspiracy by Big Pharma.And GMOs.  Don't forget them.</comment>

<comment>Yeah those exist within the leftist pantheon, but those conspiracy theories are not the driving force of leftist politics, unlike the right-wing which seems to operate heavily on conspiracy theory.Climate Change, Birthers, Progressive Plantation, the Fascist Green Plot, Young Earthers, Gay Agenda, the leftist media, cooked labor statistics, etc. Conspiracy is the driving factor of right-wing politics.On top of that, even the most prominent of conservative politicians engage in conspiracy to the cheers of their masses.Even some leftist conspiracy like vaccines, is mostly embraced by trained Conservative doctors like Carson and Paul.</comment>

<comment>Hey - it's the guy who does only one sentence ad-homs!Guess you have to be brief as they only give you 5 minute breaks at the Flying J.</comment>

<comment>Is it?  He sure knocked it out of the Park, with that one. And, all inside five minutes, including having to pee (wash those hands, employees!): good job.  That is, the post. The work, not so much.</comment>

<comment>You know that - the more money a person earns - the more likely they are to vote Republican right?  People who make < $25K overwhelmingly vote Democrat.  And that a NY Times article showed that the education level - on average - from the Tea Party was higher than average?The Speaker of the House is Paul Ryan.The Senate Majority Leader is Mitch McConnell.67/100 state houses are held by Republicans.The last two Republican nominees were Romney and McCain.W Bush is a Yale/Harvard grad who had better grades than Kerry.How many conspiracy nutters are represented by the above?I think you are painting your fellow Americans - who happen to be conservative - with too broad of a brush.</comment>

<comment>First, only six percent of scientists in the US identify as Republicans, plus there's a correlation that the people with graduate educations tend to be more liberal.Second, none of what you've said in any changes my position that many conservatives use conspiracy to justify their beliefs.I don't believe all conservatives are conspiracy nutters, but it is without a doubt a major component of the paranoid culture of modern American conservatism.</comment>

<comment>Here are the cross-tabs from 2012:https://ropercenter.cornell.ed...Dems won the least educated vote handily, along with the post-graduate vote, as it's no secret that academia skews left.Romney won the vote of the college grads.And - the data is clear on the correlation between income and the propensity to vote (R):http://themonkeycage.org/2012/...Walton family aside, most rich people earned their money, and there aren't too many dummies in that group.</comment>

<comment>None of that in any way assaults my position that conservatives rely on conspiracy theory to demonize political opponents.Assuming that wealth equals some inherent intellectual block to believing conspiracy theories doesn't convince me.Conservatives are by definition attempting to conserve traditional society and ideals, science and progress is diametrically opposed to conserving a society. I think conspiracy is the mechanism conservatives use to try & deny progress as some evil plot, rather than natural progression.I think enlightenment ideals and traditional conservatism are part of what is doing battle in the GOP primaries right now.</comment>

<comment>Romney barely won the vote of college grads, while Obama overwhelmingly won the vote of advanced degrees.</comment>

<comment>He still won those votes, and he, along with other Republicans, dominates among people who make more than $100K.You guys lose unless the laziest and lowest-info voters go to the polls.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...people with money like to keep it. That is a real news flash. We have the highest info voters, as in advanced and professional degrees, and nearly every blasted scientist in the country. You hae the Fox News crowd, which has been proven to be the least informed voter there is.</comment>

<comment>That's a fantasy.  1% of the country watches Fox.You guys have the academics and the folks on welfare.We have the guys who want to start a business and who like to go to church.</comment>

<comment>We have the smartest people AND the poorest people. Its not just academics, its Silicon Valley (and its many offshoots) & Hollywood. You get finance and corporate execs. Again....money.We also have people who start businesses and go to church and synagogue, mosque and temple.</comment>

<comment>Endorsing your disdain for Fox, let me add that the numbers are subtle. Very poor and very uneducated tend to be Democrats, but have very low turnout, so they aren't an attractive demographic to pander to.</comment>

<comment>Let me not be taken to agree wholeheartedly with Damascusdean. Academia as a bastion of Liberalism is only a self-fulfilling prophesy. Liberal ideology is so oppressive that it severely limits the possibility of comfortable environment for conservatives, questioning conventional wisdom and decency to diverse opinions.</comment>

<comment>So you just admitted that scientists are bias</comment>

<comment>For science... I guess they could biased toward science.</comment>

<comment>They can just tweek results</comment>

<comment>Unless there is a world wide global conspiracy to fake science and not teach anyone to understand or advance science, those results will come out as faked. Science is not indecipherable.</comment>

<comment>Threating someones job works. They fake a lot of science, ever hear of born gay</comment>

<comment>Like I said, if you want to go the route of world wide scientific conspiracy, that's your business.</comment>

<comment>Not all agree with it, but you can toss a buzzword out</comment>

<comment>You seem to have a problem understanding words as illustrating concepts. You're assuming words are part of some conspiracy to defraud reality of meaning, instead of as illustration of concept.You're just full of conspiracy theories.</comment>

<comment>No not really, people like you that toss buzzwords are not very bright</comment>

<comment>Maybe, it depends on whether what you consider buzz words are actually legitimate concepts to society. Then again, you have no metric other than your conspiracies to measure your beliefs, so it doesn't really matter what you believe.You can't know on any level whether you're right. You can believe it all you want and proclaim conspiracy if no one believes or agrees with you, that's your only real defense.The world is against you, science is not understandable, and words don't illustrate concepts. Very convincing.Excellent job illustrating my original point that conservatives use conspiracies to justify their intellectually untenable beliefs.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be a big fan of buzzwords? Why is that</comment>

<comment>See my previous post to read why you're wrong. It's always funny when stupid people think you're making up words to embarrass them.You should have just kept your mouth shut, now everyone knows.</comment>

<comment>You have no facts but you have a good opinion and lots of buzzwords</comment>

<comment>I have many facts on my side, but as we've discussed, you believe it is part of some conspiracy, so they aren't legitimate.I'm proposing that the sheer global scale of the deception you're convinced is happening, is not possible.</comment>

<comment>Well guess nasa disagrees with you</comment>

<comment>NASA actually agrees with me."The high-resolution data, which can be viewed on a daily timescale at the scale of individual cities and towns, will help scientists and planners conduct climate risk assessments to better understand local and global effects of hazards, such as severe drought, floods, heat waves and losses in agriculture productivity." https://www.nasa.gov/press-rel...Here's an explanation from NASA made for children."Most scientists say it's very likely that most of the warming since the mid-1900s is due to the burning of coal, oil and gas. Burning these fuels is how we produce most of the energy that we use every day." http://www.nasa.gov/audience/f...</comment>

<comment>That the ice caps are growing, good you agree with nasa</comment>

<comment>So you're going to ignore their climate predictions which are based on multiple calculations and metrics for one metric? Climate change is not global warming, that's why they changed the "buzz word" to better articulate the problem so as not to confuse people like you.</comment>

<comment>Predictions change</comment>

<comment>The glaciology you cite is actually a growing of ice in the eastern and western parts of the continent with shrinking in other areas. This actually bolsters the idea of climate change because a static climate shouldn't affect drastic changes in Earth's eco-system.You also need to consider that studies in climatology, oceanography, and geology all confirm climate change on some level. So shifting size in glaciers fits the science of climate change quite well and does the opposite of debunking it.</comment>

<comment>You forgot to add a period to the end of your sentence.</comment>

<comment>Thanks tool</comment>

<comment>You're welcome. I assumed you'd want to make sure your punctuation was in top shape when you call other people "not very bright."But maybe I'm wrong. You don't believe in global warming, maybe you don't believe in proper English either.</comment>

<comment>There is good evidence that scientists are afraid to publicly identify as Republican (some suggest even as non-liberal) and that non-Liberals are turned away from social science.Of course, it is reasonably well demonstrated that liberals have more higher education, but no causation is demonstrated. Academia may be a hostile environment, and Conservative ideology may steer people away from graduate programs. I have much anecdotal evidence about this, but the situation of distrust of social science is a difficult situation for social science to study.</comment>

<comment>Mitch McConnell argues against climate change = Mitch McConnell is a conspiracy theorist.W Bush believed that there were WMDs in Iraq = W Bush is a conspiracy theorist (I believed there were WMDs and supported the invasion as well, for what it's worth).Mitt Romney believed 47% of Americans would only pursue handouts despite the fact that his statistic involves people who receive govt pensions, GI Bill benefits, etc. = Mitt Romney is a conspiracy theorist.As far as I know people don't have to take an ideological test to determine their income, so I don't think income correlates to whether someone believes a lot of conspiracy theories.Look dude, I say this as someone who naturally leans right. But the modern-day Republican party is on a serious anti-science/anti-birth certificate kick.Furthermore, I like how you accuse Written of painting conservatives with a broad brush right after you accused all liberals of believing 9/11 was an inside job.</comment>

<comment>I could have sworn Bill Clinton believed in WMD's also but I guess that doesn't quite fit your narrative.</comment>

<comment>He might've. Lots of people buy into conspiracy theories. But I'm not really a huge fan of Bill Clinton, and him believing in WMDs (something that, as I already stated above, I believed as well) in no way disproves my statements that W Bush is not the best counter-example for JonJMac to use.</comment>

<comment>The base of the Dem party includes lots of low-education people who make very little money or are on the dole.  The base of the Republican party includes a bunch of good old boys and girls who would horrify Harvard professors.By the way, a guy running in the D primary thinks that we can bring back Eisenhower tax rates and ratchet up spending by another $12T, underwritten, of course, by the "rich" and "corporations," who, of course, are just dumb sheep.I don't believe in double standards.</comment>

<comment>This is ironic because I have yet to hear you say anything about any Republican nonsensical ideas (such as Global warming = hoax, for example), so if you don't believe in double standards you are certainly acting as if you do.Bernie Sanders ideas on economics (which I don't really agree with) are not conspiracy theories as he is not creating a narrative based on ulterior motives and shadow movements beyond what is documented fact in laws, interviews and campaign contributions. For it to be a conspiracy theory it would need an element of mystery.You'r top paragraph in no way makes an argument that economic standing correlates to a belief in conspiracy theories. You are simply making an argument about demographics.ETA: I notice that you did not attempt to counter any of my arguments that your examples of prominent Republics had some ideas that are a little out-there.</comment>

<comment>I think that both sides like their conspiracy fantasies.  I don't really feel the need to "prove" to you that I am not a conspiracy guy.THIS is what I disagree with:Climate Change, Birthers, Progressive Plantation, the Fascist Green Plot, Young Earthers, Gay Agenda, the leftist media, cooked labor statistics, etc. Conspiracy is the driving factor of right-wing politics.The "driving factor?"  Really?That's like a right winger saying that the animating factor of the left are  hate of the country and the need to kill babies.That's an unfalsifiable hypothesis from someone who obviously has only a cartoonish view of his fellow citizens.</comment>

<comment>You know, I can't really agree with you that the above statement is a broad, unfair stereotype that is more focused on divisive than problem solving (even if I would say that there is an element of conspiracy theory to the mainstream Republican talking points). However,  i will say that I've been reading the Atlantic and it's comments section for almost five years now and I have seen you always jump at the chance to do the same to those on the left.</comment>

<comment>So what government policy do Democrats back on any of these crank ideas john?Oh wait, none.</comment>

<comment>Even California didn't pass a GMO labeling bill.</comment>

<comment>They should have. Labeling is a do no harm policy.</comment>

<comment>I disagree.  I think it lends credence to the idea that GMOs are something bad.</comment>

<comment>Short version: Look a squirrel!!</comment>

<comment>Where?!?!Oh...dammit...you got me again.</comment>

<comment>Evidence that the left falls for conspiracy theories is not relevant to the smear that conspiracy is the glue behind the right?</comment>

<comment>And the Hindenburg, the government was behind it going down in flames, too.</comment>

<comment>You forgot about the faked moon landings as well.  Along with the black helicopters, and how the government was going to use recent military training in Texas to covert WalMarts into prison camps for the few remaining loyal Americans (but the Texas governor got the Texas National Guard on alert for that one, which no doubt was the only reason the nefarious plot didn’t materialize).</comment>

<comment>Some people are evidently so jealous that their real-world conspiracy theory is not as whacko as most religion's origin stories, that they just keep doubling down on the whack, trying to reach those spiritual levels.I can't even picture the Walmart thing 'cause just hearing "Walmart!" makes me laugh too much. But, it does seem like that would be the place to be imprison them: you would not even need a fence for many Americans - just keep the truckloads of products from SE Asia & South America coming, for fun & food, respectively.  You won't be able to kick them out...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but the difference is that I will loudly and confidently insult anyone who believes any of those.What are your thoughts on the causes of global warming?</comment>

<comment>It's worse than that. They don't believe in science.</comment>

<comment>Elites always engage in scientific denial when science acts as to the detriment of their power/profits. Now mass media allows them to brainwash an entire generation of people into believing it's over control.Lead in the air, poisoned wells, and ozone degradation were all defended as natural causes by elites before the science won.</comment>

<comment>Really? Because I don’t recall any conservatives leading the charge for the Clean Air and Water Acts, nor auto emissions standards or the outlawing of leaded gasoline and moving away from leaded paint. Perhaps you could provide me with the names of a few conservative supporters of those changes I should recognize. And the conservative government organizations--because certainly the EPA isn’t one--that helped implement the changes.</comment>

<comment>Weren't those under Nixon's administration 1970 and '72?</comment>

<comment>Yes and no. The initial Clean Air Acts were passed in 1963 and 1967. The Clean Air Act extension of 1970 was passed and subsequently signed by President Nixon, but Sen Muskie championed the bill and sheparded it through the legislative process to the point it was informally known as “Muskie’s Act”. Nixon vetoed the Clean Water Act as too costly in compliance, but his veto was overridden by the Senate and House and the bill became law. (Nixon also opposed the elimination of leaded gas and the shift to non-leaded.)On the whole I think Nixon’s record on the environment was positive, but he never initiated or championed any legislation, policies, or changes--his contribution was acceding to the policies and initiatives that others brought forward. Remember that in those days rivers were so polluted they caught on fire (the Cuyahoga in Cleveland), municipalities routinely dumped raw sewage into rivers upstream of the next town (as did industries with their liquid waste), air pollution in Southern Cali would be so bad you couldn’t see a half mile (I can remember the brown haze obscuring the sky and everything more than a half mile or so distant in the LA basin) (not to mention steel mills in the Mon Valley outside Pittsburgh), and other such gross evidence. Environmental issues were more bipartisan back in the late 60s and early 70s. Nixon was focused on international events (everything from the Vietnam War to detonate with he USSR to opening relations with China); environmental issues were a diversion he didn’t want to engage in.</comment>

<comment>There is obvious and destructive oppression of unpopular (meaning non-liberal) ideas in academia.However, on this issue, it is fairly obvious that human activity makes a measurable difference in terribly destructive trends.</comment>

<comment>Is Clare qualified to judge the science?</comment>

<comment>Who among us is qualified to answer your question?</comment>

<comment>Given that climate change is happening, it's not so important whether this is due to human or natural causes. Very important are the likely consequences and what we humans can do about it.While many believe that the only viable solutions involve a drastic, immediate reduction in CO2 emissions, some geoengineering solutions have recently become available that show the potential to slash CO2 levels without significant side effects. For example, chemists at George Washington University have prototyped a process that converts atmospheric CO2 into very valuable carbon fibers. They calculate that an area 1/10 the size of the Sahara Desert, equipped with these devices, would reduce atmospheric CO2 to pre-industrial levels within 10 years.If corroborated, this is of utmost importance since fossil fuel infrastructure is going to continue operating for many years to come. That said, I document multiple presently available, carbon neutral and sustainable ways to meet the world's present and near-future energy needs in my new book, A Celebration Society.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, there’s a large gap between research and implementation. I once heard Edward Teller decry the failure to harness fusion to provide electrical power. His comment was that the physics were well understood--he had, after all, discovered much of the underlying theory himself. All that was left was some fairly trivial applied engineering to take advantage of his discoveries.</comment>

<comment>You're right, of course, about the gap--but this CO2 capture system is a far simpler technology than nuclear fusion. There's no apparent reason it shouldn't scale, whether to a vast area of desert or to many tiny areas such as backyards.</comment>

<comment>I acknowledge that the gap between research and implementation can be larger than it appears at first. However, I'm sure that the gap between a small plate for capturing CO2 and an enormous number of such plates is far less than the gap between fusion theory and fusion implementation.BTW--we appear to finally be on the verge of commercially viable fusion; at least if the designs from Lockheed, MIT and LPP are as promised.</comment>

<comment>You can also get gold out of beach sand, but you have to process a whole lot of sand to get very little gold. Trying to get carbon out of the atmoshphere is a lot harder than keeping it out in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but where's the ironic dystopian science fiction novel in that?</comment>

<comment>"Dune of Gold....the Sequel."</comment>

<comment>Who cares? Throw in some sex and Hollywood will make a movie of it.</comment>

<comment>That's an amazing premise for a novel: somehow, the world's nations combine their resources to cover 1/10th of the Sahara Desert with these machines.  .. and they work as advertised, producing advanced carbon fibers that the global economy quickly uses to create a new generation of technological miracles. Fast forward 10 years, and atmospheric CO2 has been reduced to.  . . 50% of pre-industrial levels and dropping, because individual nations have been quietly expanding the program on their own territory to fill the increasing need of their manufacturing sectors for a supply of these precious carbon fibers.Fast forward 10 years later: CO2 is being sucked out of the atmosphere at an alarming rate, and the lifting of all caps on carbon emissions is the only thing slowing it down. Futurologists look with dread to a time when the fossil fuels run out, and no ready source of replacement CO2 is available.The last chapter is set 10 years after that. Plant life all over the world is suffering from what the scientists call a "Carbon Draught", and what humanity is experiencing as ecological calamity of unimaginable proportions. The loss of atmospheric density is resulting in cataclysmic global cooling, putting the earth's dying forests under even greater stress. . . .</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a good plot, but good luck getting funding for that script in Hollywood.</comment>

<comment>No worries: I'd pitch the story there as a subversive allegory for what's actually happening (i.e.: greedy businessmen and myopic governments wrecking the world)</comment>

<comment>Go for it!</comment>

<comment>Yes, I saw that breakthrough from one of the USA's more leftist universities.The problem is scale. In order to stop global warming from getting any worse we're going to need to manufacture about 40 Billion metric tons of carbon nanofibers per year. And that will only be enough to stop the increase, we'll need to increase production even more to bring the CO2 levels back down. By comparison, worldwide annual steel production is about 1.3 billion tons.</comment>

<comment>It needn't be the Sahara Desert; only an area (or many areas) equivalent to that. Also, I see no reason why these couldn't be deployed in a "high rise" fashion, thereby reducing the footprint.</comment>

<comment>Additional CO2 in the atmosphere will have immediate beneficial effects on agricultural output. Any cost-benefit analysis of CO2 sequester systems must be balanced against the actual risks of AGW. As i have stated, the current computer models have failed to predict the last 20 years correctly so they cannot be trusted at all until they are revised to correct their mistakes, and even then must be revalidated by making correct predictions.</comment>

<comment>"Additional CO2 in the atmosphere will have immediate beneficial effects on agricultural output."Source please. Because wheat's nutritional value drops with higher CO2 levels.</comment>

<comment>CO2 is plant food. Greenhouses routine amp up C02 to 1500 - 1800 ppm to obtain better plant growth.</comment>

<comment>And we don't grow wheat in greenhouses.</comment>

<comment>It's not practical. But if CO2 rises in the wheat fields, so will wheat growth.</comment>

<comment>You're not listening. As the the CO2 level rises, the nutritional value of wheat drops. You may get more of it, but it's worth less.</comment>

<comment>I do think that these approaches need to be explored and considered.  At some point we have to figure out how to use solar or nuclear or biological energy to remove  carbon.</comment>

<comment>As I discuss in my book, we already have viable technologies for massive capture of carbon dioxide, as well as carbon-neutral ways of producing as much energy as an Abundance Game-based civilization may require.</comment>

<comment>Ross, pay attention here: The last time C02 increased over 100 ppm it took 80,000 years and it just took 180 years to increase from 200 to 400 ppm. There has NEVER been as large an increase in C02 or temperature in such an infinitesimally short period of time. And that timespan happens to coincide exactly with industrialization relying on burning fossil fuels. There, got it?</comment>

<comment>I DON'T GET IT---WHY ARE PEOPLE AFRAID TO EVEN HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT THIS TOPIC?!  Shouldn't debating facts be more relevant than name calling?  31,487 Scientists including 9,029 PhD; 7,157 MS; 2,586 MD and DVM; and 12,715 BS or equivalent academic degrees have signed the OISM petition stating: "there is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide will, in the forseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere".  All of the signers have formal educations in fields of specialization that suitably qualify them to evaluate the research data related to the petition statement. Many of the signers currently work in climatological, meteorological, atmospheric, environmental, geophysical, astronomical, and biological fields directly involved in the climate change controversy.</comment>

<comment>The "Oregon Petition." Sigh.Arthur Robinson and the "Oregon Institute of Science and Medicine."Double sigh.http://www.sourcewatch.org/ind...There is nothing to debate.

The publish their results which may or may not concur. This process has - the scientific method - has resulted in 97% of climate scientists - not engineers, etc. - agreeing that global warming is happening and is man made:A  2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences - found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change.  It also concluded that "the relative climate expertise and scientiﬁc prominence" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are "substantially below that of the convinced researchers."An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- surveyed scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146) and asked: "Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question.http://www.politifact.com/trut...There is a group of people, of which you, Savvyheat, seem to be one, that are "cautious."

Concerned that the report might not be trusted if it was known that it was commissioned by an oil company, Happer discussed ways to obscure the funding. Happer asked that the fee be donated to the climate-change skeptic organization CO2 Coalition, who suggested he reach out to the Donors Trust, in order to keep the source of funds secret; hiding funding in this way is lawful under US law. Happer acknowledged that his report would probably not pass peer-review with a scientific journal.[28]"</comment>

<comment>Just got into a debate at work regarding this a-hole and climate science, with the more conservative members of the group stating that there are always two sides to the story. My reply was, there is not two sides when one side has no evidence to support their assumptions, where the other side has ample. So let us be clear, there is science, and then there is BS. Ted Cruz represents BS and should never be taken seriously in any capacity. The fact that he heads the Science Committee is embarrassing.</comment>

<comment>I will quote from the below:Firstly, the disagreement is not about whether the Earth's average temperature changes, but whether human actions are the predominant cause and what, if anything, human intervention can actually solve. Being an agnostic on the issue who incidentally has a masters in Chemistry, all I can say is, to boil an extremely complex phenomenon with literally thousands of contributing variables down to the environmental chemistry of man-made greenhouse gases is extremely crude.The key question is this - how much money should be spent to reduce future temps - assuming the models are correct - by 0.3C?The other question is - how much of this burden should be placed on the U.S. and W. Europe?The corollary to all of this is - does anyone expect Obama to 1) cut a deal in the U.S.'s interests, and 2) actually tell the truth about it?You guys certainly didn't give O the benefit of the doubt on the TPP now did you?</comment>

<comment>He's got guts, i'll give him this. Unlike liberal cowards who stick to the friendly fields of MSNBC, SALON, NEW YORKER, et al, Cruz this morning walked into the belly-of-the-beast offices of uber-liberal NPR and shot it out with their morning mouthpiece Steve Inskeep fighting him to a standstill by observing that the chief difference between the theory of global warming and that of evolution, as put forward by Inskeep, is that the latter does not pickpocket your wallet. The fact remains that liberals are ever and anon, abject and gross hypocrites on the subject of global warming-AKA- ''climate change''. Liberal [ leftist really ] Ed Begley Jr, left Tinseltown behind because he saw the tons of fossil fuels, plastics, and waste that went into every motion picture, even a lousy sitcom. He now eschews air travel, grid living, internal combustion anything, and so walks the walk.                            He also represents some thousandths of a point of percentage of one when it comes to lecturing liberals from Obama , Kerry, and algore on down who pontificate to the unwashed masses like a pack of Borgia-era popes and then return to their various orgies of lifestyle that have absolutely nothing to do with ''saving'' anything. Who knows just how many thousands of tons of wasted food, millions in carbon, and billions in hot air are being expended in Paris as we write.                            Cruz is correct. The scam is nothing more than a buck-hustling big gummint power trip.</comment>

As with everything else in his career, an ideology so rigid and bombastic that it's destroyed what is by all accounts a substantial intelligence has made him say provably wrong things.</comment>

<comment>I wonder if he actually believes what he says, or just doesn't care.</comment>

<comment>It is important to understand at the outset that those of us who are skeptical of mankind’s influence on climate have a wide variety of views on the subject, and we can’t all be right. In fact, in this business, it is really easy to be wrong. It seems like everyone has a theory of what causes climate change. But it only takes one of us to be right for the IPCC’s anthropogenic global warming (AGW) house of cards to collapse.As I like to say, taking measurements of the climate system is much easier than figuring out what those measurements mean in terms of cause and effect. Generally speaking, it’s not the warming that is in dispute…it’s the cause of the warming.1) Are Global Temperatures Rising Now? There is no way to know, because natural year-to-year variability in global temperature is so large, with warming and cooling occurring all the time. What we can say is that surface and lower atmospheric temperature have risen in the last 30 to 50 years, with most of that warming in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the magnitude of recent warming is somewhat uncertain, due to problems in making long-term temperature measurements with thermometers without those measurements being corrupted by a variety of non-climate effects. But there is no way to know if temperatures are continuing to rise now…we only see warming (or cooling) in the rearview mirror, when we look back in time.2) Why Do Some Scientists Say It’s Cooling, while Others Say the Warming is Even Accelerating? Since there is so much year-to-year (and even decade-to-decade) variability in global average temperatures, whether it has warmed or cooled depends upon how far back you look in time. For instance, over the last 100 years, there was an overall warming which was stronger toward the end of the 20th Century. This is why some say “warming is accelerating”. But if we look at a shorter, more recent period of time, say since the record warm year of 1998, one could say that it has cooled in the last 10-12 years. But, as I mentioned above, neither of these can tell us anything about whether warming is happening “now”, or will happen in the future.3) Haven’t Global Temperatures Risen Before? Yes. In the longer term, say hundreds to thousands of years, there is considerable indirect, proxy evidence (not from thermometers) of both warming and cooling. Since humankind can’t be responsible for these early events is evidence that nature can cause warming and cooling. If that is the case, it then opens up the possibility that some (or most) of the warming in the last 50 years has been natural, too. While many geologists like to point to much larger temperature changes are believed to have occurred over millions of years, I am unconvinced that this tells us anything of use for understanding how humans might influence climate on time scales of 10 to 100 years.4) But Didn’t the “Hockey Stick” Show Recent Warming to be Unprecedented? The “hockey Stick” reconstructions of temperature variations over the last 1 to 2 thousand years have been a huge source of controversy. The hockey stick was previously used by the IPCC as a veritable poster child for anthropogenic warming, since it seemed to indicate there have been no substantial temperature changes over the last 1,000 to 2,000 years until humans got involved in the 20th Century. The various versions of the hockey stick were based upon limited amounts of temperature proxy evidence — primarily tree rings — and involved questionable statistical methods. In contrast, I think the bulk of the proxy evidence supports the view that it was at least as warm during the Medieval Warm Period, around 1000 AD. The very fact that recent tree ring data erroneously suggests cooling in the last 50 years, when in fact there has been warming, should be a warning flag about using tree ring data for figuring out how warm it was 1,000 years ago. But without actual thermometer data, we will never know for sure.5) Isn’t the Melting of Arctic Sea Ice Evidence of Warming?Warming, yes…manmade warming, no. Arctic sea ice naturally melts back every summer, but that meltback was observed to reach a peak in 2007. But we have relatively accurate, satellite-based measurements of Arctic (and Antarctic) sea ice only since 1979. It is entirely possible that late summer Arctic Sea ice cover was just as low in the 1920s or 1930s, a period when Arctic thermometer data suggests it was just as warm. Unfortunately, there is no way to know, because we did not have satellites back then. Interestingly, Antarctic sea ice has been growing nearly as fast as Arctic ice has been melting over the last 30+ years.6) What about rising sea levels? I must confess, I don’t pay much attention to the sea level issue. I will say that, to the extent that warming occurs, sea levels can be expected to also rise to some extent. The rise is partly due to thermal expansion of the water, and partly due to melting or shedding of land-locked ice (the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and glaciers). But this says nothing about whether or not humans are the cause of that warming. Since there is evidence that glacier retreat and sea level rise started well before humans can be blamed, causation is — once again — a major source of uncertainty.7) Is Increasing CO2 Even Capable of Causing Warming? There are some very intelligent people out there who claim that adding more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere can’t cause warming anyway. They claim things like, “the atmospheric CO2 absorption bands are already saturated”, or something else very technical. [And for those more technically-minded persons, yes, I agree that the effective radiating temperature of the Earth in the infrared is determined by how much sunlight is absorbed by the Earth. But that doesn't mean the lower atmosphere cannot warm from adding more greenhouse gases, because at the same time they also cool the upper atmosphere]. While it is true that most of the CO2-caused warming in the atmosphere was there before humans ever started burning coal and driving SUVs, this is all taken into account by computerized climate models that predict global warming. Adding more “should” cause warming, with the magnitude of that warming being the real question. But I’m still open to the possibility that a major error has been made on this fundamental point. Stranger things have happened in science before.8 ) Is Atmospheric CO2 Increasing? Yes, and most strongly in the last 50 years…which is why “most” climate researchers think the CO2 rise is the cause of the warming. Our site measurements of CO2 increase from around the world are possibly the most accurate long-term, climate-related, measurements in existence.9) Are Humans Responsible for the CO2 Rise? While there are short-term (year-to-year) fluctuations in the atmospheric CO2 concentration due to natural causes, especially El Nino and La Nina, I currently believe that most of the long-term increase is probably due to our use of fossil fuels. But from what I can tell, the supposed “proof” of humans being the source of increasing CO2 — a change in the atmospheric concentration of the carbon isotope C13 — would also be consistent with a natural, biological source. The current atmospheric CO2 level is about 390 parts per million by volume, up from a pre-industrial level estimated to be around 270 ppm…maybe less. CO2 levels can be much higher in cities, and in buildings with people in them.10) But Aren’t Natural CO2 Emissions About 20 Times the Human Emissions? Yes, but nature is believed to absorb CO2 at about the same rate it is produced. You can think of the reservoir of atmospheric CO2 as being like a giant container of water, with nature pumping in a steady stream into the bottom of the container (atmosphere) in some places, sucking out about the same amount in other places, and then humans causing a steady drip-drip-drip into the container. Significantly, about 50% of what we produce is sucked out of the atmosphere by nature, mostly through photosynthesis. Nature loves the stuff. CO2 is the elixir of life on Earth. Imagine the howls of protest there would be if we were destroying atmospheric CO2, rather than creating more of it.11) Is Rising CO2 the Cause of Recent Warming? While this is theoretically possible, I think it is more likely that the warming is mostly natural. At the very least, we have no way of determining what proportion is natural versus human-caused.12) Why Do Most Scientists Believe CO2 is Responsible for the Warming? Because (as they have told me) they can’t think of anything else that might have caused it. Significantly, it’s not that there is evidence nature can’t be the cause, but a lack of sufficiently accurate measurements to determine if nature is the cause. This is a hugely important distinction, and one the public and policymakers have been misled on by the IPCC.13) If Not Humans, What could Have Caused Recent Warming?This is one of my areas of research. I believe that natural changes in the amount of sunlight being absorbed by the Earth — due to natural changes in cloud cover — are responsible for most of the warming. Whether that is the specific mechanism or not, I advance the minority view that the climate system can change all by itself. Climate change does not require an “external” source of forcing, such as a change in the sun.14) So, What Could Cause Natural Cloud Changes? I think small, long-term changes in atmospheric and oceanic flow patterns can cause ~1% changes in how much sunlight is let in by clouds to warm the Earth. This is all that is required to cause global warming or cooling. Unfortunately, we do not have sufficiently accurate cloud measurements to determine whether this is the primary cause of warming in the last 30 to 50 years.15) How Significant is the Climategate Release of E-Mails? While Climategate does not, by itself, invalidate the IPCC’s case that global warming has happened, or that humans are the primary cause of that warming, it DOES illustrate something I emphasized in my first book, “Climate Confusion”: climate researchers are human, and prone to bias.16) Why Would Bias in Climate Research be Important? I thought Scientists Just Follow the Data Where It Leads Them When researchers approach a problem, their pre-conceived notions often guide them. It’s not that the IPCC’s claim that humans cause global warming is somehow untenable or impossible, it’s that political and financial pressures have resulted in the IPCC almost totally ignoring alternative explanations for that warming.17) How Important Is “Scientific Consensus” in Climate Research?In the case of global warming, it is nearly worthless. The climate system is so complex that the vast majority of climate scientists — usually experts in variety of specialized fields — assume there are more knowledgeable scientists, and they are just supporting the opinions of their colleagues. And among that small group of most knowledgeable experts, there is a considerable element of groupthink, herd mentality, peer pressure, political pressure, support of certain energy policies, and desire to Save the Earth — whether it needs to be saved or not.18) How Important are Computerized Climate Models? I consider climate models as being our best way of exploring cause and effect in the climate system. It is really easy to be wrong in this business, and unless you can demonstrate causation with numbers in equations, you are stuck with scientists trying to persuade one another by waving their hands. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that climate models will ever produce a useful prediction of the future. Nevertheless, we must use them, and we learn a lot from them. My biggest concern is that models have been used almost exclusively for supporting the claim that humans cause global warming, rather than for exploring alternative hypotheses — e.g. natural climate variations — as possible causes of that warming.19) What Do I Predict for Global Temperature Changes in the Future? I tend to shy away from long-term predictions, because there are still so many uncertainties. When pressed, though, I tend to say that I think cooling in our future is just as real a possibility as warming. Of course, a third possibility is relatively steady temperatures, without significant long-term warming or cooling. Keep in mind that, while you will find out tomorrow whether your favorite weather forecaster is right or wrong, no one will remember 50 years from now a scientist today wrongly predicting we will all die from heat stroke by 2060.Concluding RemarksClimate researchers do not know nearly as much about the causes of climate change as they profess. We have a pretty good understanding of how the climate system works on average…but the reasons for small, long-term changes in climate system are still extremely uncertain.The total amount of CO2 humans have added to the atmosphere in the last 100 years has upset the radiative energy budget of the Earth by only 1%. How the climate system responds to that small “poke” is very uncertain. The IPCC says there will be strong warming, with cloud changes making the warming worse. I claim there will be weak warming, with cloud changes acting to reduce the influence of that 1% change. The difference between these two outcomes is whether cloud feedbacks are positive (the IPCC view), or negative (the view I and a minority of others have).So far, neither side has been able to prove their case. That uncertainty even exists on this core issue is not appreciated by many scientists!</comment>
