<comment>Whatever it is Muslims worship, it is not the Christian God. She deserved to be fired.</comment>

<comment>The stories overlap. Jews, Christians, and Muslims worship the "God of Abraham."</comment>

<comment>A typical liberal response to religion is to regard it as a folktale.</comment>

<comment>All 3 holy books are collections of stories. That is fact, not me being dismissive. From the characters and situations in the stories, we know they take place in the same universe and involve the same divine being.</comment>

<comment>On what basis do you claim your assessment of religion as nothing more than stories? To date there is no evidence in science or philosophy to suggest that this is true and you pronouncing it as fact is hardly proof at all. In fact, the further science develops, including physics, anthropology, archaeology, etc, the more we find to confirm theism. Particularly Christian theism. Now, materialism (also known as naturalism) is the claim (assumption really)  that nothing in science or philosophy can be explained or influenced by the supernatural. This, however, is simply a belief structure, taken entirely on faith, with no basis in actual scientific theory. It is more like a religion than any acknowledgement of the possibility of a god. Inasmuch, there is actually greater conflict between materialism and science than there is between science and theism, where in fact, there is no conflict at all. None.So before claiming the privilege of "fact", a better understanding of science, religion and materialism might be edifying.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say that religion was just stories. I said that the holy books were collections of stories, which they are. I don't need proof to back that up, the books themselves are full of stories. The story of Noah and the whale, the story of Lot and his wives, the story of Abraham and his son.</comment>

<comment>I think you mean Noah had an ark and Jonah had the whale...</comment>

<comment>Well, the ark was a whale of a story, but Jonah had a big fish. A whale is a mammal.</comment>

<comment>I Noah story about a Jonah of Ark.... (sorry) :)</comment>

<comment>Yes, I've read the Gnostic gospels and other NT apocrypha, but I've never heard the suggestion that Jesus wrote of these. Perhaps I am misunderstanding you?I Googled around for things Jesus might have written. As so often happens, I learned a lot, but not what I was looking for. There is some sort of "The Letter to King Abgar", but no one thinks it was really written by Jesus.</comment>

<comment>That's funny, and also sweet. My family does not celebrate Christmas, but there is a Jewish tradition of "Tikkun olam", which means more-or-less "Repair the earth". Your suggestion is in that spirit.</comment>

<comment>I think you may misunderstand the "traditional" Jewish messiah. And well you should, as there are a number of different Jewish interpretations. However, as far as I know, in none of them will the Messiah be a Deity. That would be polytheism, because we (unfortunately) lack the ability for subtle reasoning that accepts the Trinity. (I should say that I don't speak for all Jews. No one does!)But yes, please do share!</comment>

<comment>Actually, they run out pretty fast in Genesis. Then you are left with page after page of dry Jewish law.</comment>

<comment>(Wives = daughters)</comment>

<comment>First off, the Bible is not just a collection of stories. Leviticus, Number, Deuteronomy are all books of law and/or genealogy. Aside from the four gospels and Acts, the New Testament is composed of letters, primarily of doctrine, not stories. So your assessment is still false. Sadly so, in fact. Oh, and there is no story of Noah and the whale. You might be thinking of Jonah. Either way, you seem to have a significant misunderstanding of scripture for one who publicly pontificate on its subject matter.</comment>

<comment>He did not say that the bible is nothing more than stories. I suspect he believes that, but he didn't say it.</comment>

<comment>Stories can be true.  Not sure why referring to the Bible as a collection of stories would be offensive.</comment>

<comment>«In fact, the further science develops, including physics, anthropology, archaeology, etc, the more we find to confirm theism. Particularly Christian theism.»No.</comment>

<comment>Name one single scientific fact that calls into question anything in Christian belief. Just one. Hint, don't pick miracles. Quantum mechanics is all about the statistical possibility of miracles. Don't go with evolution either. There is nothing in evolutionary theory that precludes a deity from creating things in whatever fashion it chose to, including natural selection. Big bang, no, you _really_ don't want to go there. String theory? What a joke.</comment>

<comment>«In fact, the further science develops (…) the more we find to confirm theism» vs «Name one single scientific fact that calls into question anything in Christian belief»; shifting the goalposts, are we?Science does not deal with beliefs as beliefs are not falsifiable – and therefore it cannot confirm one's belief, and it cannot disprove one's belief.HTH, HAND.</comment>

<comment>Evolution makes sense only if there is a god.</comment>

<comment>Oh?</comment>

<comment>"..the further science develops, including physics, anthropology, archaeology, etc, the more we find to confirm theism."  That simply is not true, quite the opposite.  Your "science" must come from Ken Hamm at the creation museum.</comment>

<comment>Your rather long winded response is based on a false premise. I believe I read the same comment and it does not make the allegation that religions are just a collection of stories.  He, correctly, said that the books that are held to be holy are just collections of stories. The rest of your response is just your expression of YOUR opinion and cannot claim privilege of "fact".Both Christianity and Islam claim there is but one God so they must be talking about the same one OR they contradict and there is more than one God.</comment>

<comment>That's a nonsensical statement in terms of both theology and logic. If it were true, that would mean all monotheistic religions have the same god.  Islam/Judaism/Christianity contradicting simply implies that each has a different -conceptual- God.  It does not mean there is actually more than one God (or any at all).</comment>

<comment>Hardly. Anyone can claim to know God or know who God is. I can claim my toaster is God. If there is a God or not, some of these claims will be metaphysically mistaken. Period. No breach of logic here, although you did torture it a bit.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't mean that there are different Gods, only that people don't conceptualize God the same.</comment>

<comment>What is the difference between a variety of conceptualizations, abstract and unquantifiable as they are, and a variety of immaterial deities, abstract and unquantifiable as they are?</comment>

<comment>What colour was the dress?  http://www.telegraph.co.uk/new...</comment>

<comment>It's a striped pattern of six of one and half a dozen of the other.</comment>

<comment>That rather slides around the question.  Many people saw the dress as white and gold, whereas it was blue and black.  Their perception was wrong.  Their brains were misinterpreting the light reflecting off the dress.</comment>

<comment>*Both Christianity and Islam claim there is but one God so they must be talking about the same one OR they contradict and there is more than one God.*The God(s) proclaimed in e book contradict e other.  Therefore, one is correct, or both are wrong.  Both cannnot be right since each one is a claim to MONOtheism.</comment>

<comment>The missing portion is Jesus the Son of God. "No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also" 1 John 2:23</comment>

<comment>Correct. Period.</comment>

<comment>That's hardly the point.If I have 3 sons, and I tell them all, "Don't eat the cookies in the cookie jar"1st interprets that as "Don't eat any cookies"2nd interprets that as "Don't eat the cookies that are in the specific jar labelled cookies"3rd interprets it as "eat all the cookies"only one of those son's may be right, but it certainly doesn't mean because two are wrong they have different fathers.</comment>

<comment>What? Religion is essentially about knowing God. Christian doctrine, as has been stated here many times, says that no one who does not know Christ can know the Father. Therefore, everyone else's concept of who God is, is mistake......according to Christian doctrine.A better example is that Dad says don't eat the cookies in the cookie jar and two of the sons claim that Uncle Fred is the one who said it and is thusly their father.</comment>

<comment>But that would mean that the jewish people for example all worshipped the correct god before jesus and a different god after. I think the interpretation of that is more along the lines of knowing the true nature of god not whether he is the samw god as well as acording to the christian faith the only way to god ia through his son. Just because chriatians believe you cannot get to god through other means doesn't mean they think he ia a different god. But hey thats interpretation for you</comment>

<comment>Contradict each other how?</comment>

<comment>Yet one book says that Jesus is the Son of God and the only way to salvation, and the other says Jesus is not the Son of God. So, they are NOT the same at all. "No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also" 1 John 2:23</comment>

<comment>Correct. Astonishing how hard some people struggle with this. I suspect the source of their struggle is this smug mulitcultural "coexist" karma they have been brought up to believe in. They desperately want either everyone to be right or none one to be right. The concept that any one group has a grasp on truth is impossible for them to stomach.</comment>

<comment>You are sadly incorrect in three ways. First, he said religions where stories. The implication is that they were fiction. There is no evidence that this is true. Second, if that is not what he was implying, and he says it was not, then he contends that scripture, like the Bible, is just stories. He, and you, are totally wrong. The Pauline and other apostolic letters are, well, letters. Mostly of doctrine. Revelation, Daniel and others are apocalyptic visions, not stories. Psalms, is psalms. Songs and poems. Deuteronomy, Leviticus and Numbers are books of law and genealogy. not stories or any sort. The books of the prophets are prophecy. Not stories. So his fact that religious beliefs are based on stories is simply, patently and totally incorrect. Not fact, of any sort.Third, three religions claim to worship the same God. Each one thinks the other two are wrong. Jesus stated very clearly that no one who does not believe that he was the Son of God can know the Father. Simple as that.So much religious pontificating from people who have no idea about the religions they are spouting off about.</comment>

<comment>The God of the Gaps folks are always fun.</comment>

<comment>Not at all. If anything science is proving that the universe is unimaginable chaos. Any imagined order we perceive is self-delusion driven by our human tendency to perceive patterns in randomness. There can be no God. From the perspective of the universe, our existence here on this planet is not even a rounding error.What the hell else are we going to do on this tiny planet than sit around making up stories? </comment>

<comment>You mean I'm just the result of a random quantum fluctuation in the vacuum that got locked into existence during a hyperfast inflation of the universe which broke the intrinsic symmetry of "nothing" due to the fact that 'nothing' is actually full of dark energy which causes eternal expansion of the universe?Now that makes a whole lot more sense than saying that God said "let there be light."</comment>

<comment>That is so far LESS sensical that believing in a creator God than anything I have ever heard. And you didn't think it up of course. It is the latest ideological nonsense to drivel out of the branch of physics which is far more concerned with disproving a God whose existence they deny de facto than any sort of science.You should also know that it is widely and instantly rebuffed by even the simplest physicist, theologian or philosopher because it is patently illogical and simply turns on abusing the concept of nothing. Nothing is, in fact, nothing. Dark energy is something. Not nothing. Claiming that it is nothing is absurd and simply takes you one step further into an infinite regression.Dark energy is something. Period. All things must have a cause. Dark energy must have a cause. So you're back to God or admitting that you have absolutely NO IDEA where it came from (which is, in fact, the current state of modern physics).And in that regard, God is far less probable than any _thing_ being uncaused.Try again.</comment>

<comment>Anyone claiming to be a scientist and refuses to question a theory is a liar and not a scientist.</comment>

<comment>Uh, er, ...we also roast marshmallows when telling them?</comment>

<comment>You seem to suffer from the same kind of faith-based science the Creationists do.</comment>

<comment>I think you're missing the part about stories being fact or fiction. Both are still stories.</comment>

<comment>True. And it was not the posters (claimed) intent to say that they were fiction. But he is still sadly mistaken. Jewish, Christian and Islamic scriptures include far more that stories. So he's wrong either way.</comment>

<comment>At their base they are stories.  What you choose to add to them is your choice.  A Ferrari is an automobile and so is a Yugo.  I fail to see how describing them as such could be mistaken.</comment>

<comment>More like a religion than any acknowledgement of the possibility of a god?</comment>

<comment>The all-loving, all-knowing God didn't realize that Adam and Eve would eat the Tree-o-knowledge apples if he left them alone with Satan.  Then he blows a gasket when they do.He knew they'd do it before he created them, right?  He is full of nothing but love, yet leaves them alone with Satan.There actually are some real problems with this story if you allow yourself to apply logic to it.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I think you will find that the authors of Genesis were probably a whole lot smarter than the average dumb @$$ human today who attempts to apply a literal historical meaning to this. It is clear that they were using the literary constructs of the time to attempt to explain their understanding of  why human beings, who essentially are just material creatures, actually developed a sense of value and morality that was higher than the simple material world in which they existed. In many ways it was quite sophisticated for someone who lived in a pre-scientific age.</comment>

<comment> It is clear that they were using the literary constructs of the time ...So they were lying.</comment>

<comment>No. Read what he said again.</comment>

<comment>Yes!!  If I may I just wanted to chime in with a personal note; shows like "Ancient Aliens" INFURIATE me simply because it implies that our ancestors were idiots and were incapable of being awesome all by themselves.</comment>

<comment>The Old Testament was written in languages we don't really know for audiences we don't know. Whether fundamentalist or atheist, those pretending to know exactly what it means are invariably fools.</comment>

<comment>I agree. There are those who choose a literal understanding of the creation story. I do not look at it that way but I do not condemn their views. For modern Christians with a thorough understanding of science, a literal translation might seem childish and their understanding of the creation story as allegory is unlikely to be harmful to their beliefs.On the other hand, Christian belief is based almost solely of the physical, bodily resurrection of a man who had been dead three days. If we have the faith to believe that, we have to examine why we might draw the line at a literal translation of Genesis.But your point is well taken. Even when taken as allegorical the story of Genesis, as it is laid out, coincides with much of what we are told by modern physics and astronomy.</comment>

<comment>You must be joking. Those who "believe" willfully ignore the physical evidence that their beliefs are erroneous. They are, and I say this gently, morons who can't grasp contradiction. Why did God give us science? Why did he allow us to find fossils and be able to verify the age of those fossils. Why do those people, for example, acknowledge how oil, coal, etc, come to be, but then deny the age of the world? The spread of Christianity is due to the political hegemony of Rome and Constantine, not the metaphor considered "truth" and "God's word" in the Bible.Too many Christians fail to understand in their arrogance that there are religions older than Christianity and that those religions have just as much legitimacy to their followers as Chistianity does to Christians. Before missionaries really got going, we're all the Rus and the Chinese, the peoples of the Indian sub-continent and aboriginals of South America, Australia, North America, etc, doomed? Of course not. There is a basic morality that transcends arbitrary religious labeling. In order to believe in God, one has to ignore how religions arise, why so many want pat explanation for those things yet to be explained. Cognitive dissonance is best explained by using the various interpretations of God.</comment>

<comment>But, but, if this is an omnipotent god, how could there be someone like Satan in conflict with him in the first place?</comment>

<comment>For balance.</comment>

<comment>They don't seem to be in conflict in Job...</comment>

<comment>My favorite is the sacrifice of Isaac.</comment>

<comment>Not true. You are essentially citing the "problem of evil". It is now little more than a sophomoric trick in regard to disproving the existence of God. It was soundly and throughly solved years ago, on secular terms and logical dictates and does not represent a defeater for Christianity or theism. The argument is complex. Too much so to recite here.  Alvin Plantinga is the man who finally buried it. You can Google him. But if you hear the 'problem of evil' and an argument against God or religion in a philosophy or religion class, you should get your money back....your professor is 50 years behind the times.</comment>

<comment>I have a marvelous refutation of the problem of evil, but it's too long to fit in this comment box. Please read someone else for it. So if anyone mentions theodicy, they're wrong because I say so.</comment>

<comment>There is 0 scientific proof of religious texts. Zero.</comment>

<comment>Science does not offer "proof". It offers evidence. So, there is no scientific evidence that religious texts are true.</comment>

<comment>They are just stories.It is your belief in them that becomes a religion in practice.</comment>

<comment>The burden  of proof rests upon those who say something exists is true so we don't have to prove bible myths are true or that there isn't a god. It is presumed that the stories are myths and that there are no gods until those who claim there are prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt.</comment>

<comment>The debate as to whether god exists or not is an unrelated topic. The subject we are discussing is whether or not they all worship the same god, which they do. To exhibit the ridiculousness that this goes to, Protestants and Catholics both are "Christians" but they both hate each other because of the way they worship the same god! Hilarious. So dumb.</comment>

<comment>I see now why Adam and Eve were forbidden to eat from the tree of knowledge. If people had the knowledge thee would be no religion.</comment>

<comment>What exacly is the archaeological evidence for Christianity?  There is none for virtually the entire Old Testament prior to the exile and even Jesus left no archaeological footprint.</comment>

<comment>You are being dismissive, dismissive of Christianity and its teachings. While Muslims will insist we worship the same god, Christians know better that their God is the one true God and the Muslim god is a deception, a perversion of the Abrahamic view of God.</comment>

<comment>I realize this is off-topic, but why do we have a down arrow/button? Does the person's post get moved down?(Sorry for the above question; hopefully I can be forgiven for my 'transgression'. Or maybe a couple of Hail Marys?) </comment>

<comment>those arrows aimed up or down are to say you either liked or disliked the post, up for like</comment>

<comment>I already understand that the down arrow means I disagree in some way. But while the up arrow has a number you can add to, the down arrow does not. So I don't understand what the point is in clicking on the down arrow, that's all.</comment>

<comment>Discus used to have an up arrow for approval and a down arrow for disapproval. For whatever reason, they removed the disapproval but left the down arrow button there.Good question.</comment>

<comment>Disapproval will not be tolerated. </comment>

<comment>Trolls probably demanded a "safe space" atmosphere.</comment>

<comment>The down arrow is a placebo. Like the 'walk' button on the traffic light</comment>

<comment>Thanks for taking that away from me. [end sarc]</comment>

<comment>The downvotes are still there. You can see them if you right click on the down arrow and hit "Inspect Element (Q)" They do effect the rank of posts if you order them by "most popular". I don't think many people click on them much anymore since you can't see them, but Courageousmistrj managed to rack up 29 downvotes for his OP. This is why he ranks below a person who got 2 upvotes for their comment, even though he managed to get 17 upvotes. You would have to wade through a lot of crap to get to this thread if you accessed it from the Disqus website, which automatically orders posts that way. I'm also certain that Disqus uses them in their algorithm when crunching all of the data they collect on commenters and comments.</comment>

<comment>I did not know that. Gosh darn gee heck. And here I've been ignoring the trolls.</comment>

<comment>If you are interested in the real answer, I posted it below in reply to Mr. Fusion. Disqus got rid of the number because they believed it was creating a negative atmosphere on the boards, but kept the arrow because they monetize data.</comment>

<comment>And unfortunately the down votes no longer tally on screen as they used to.I think it was Disqus's attempted at creating a "safe space".It might be interesting if Disqus allowed downvotes to negate upvotes and vice versa, thus each persons profile could dispaly only a net number of one or the other.I'm probably the only one here who'd take a hit if worked that way...right?</comment>

<comment>but then, Hillary's paid propaganda staff would be able to bury the truth.</comment>

<comment>At the top of the discussion, just under your user name, you can choose the way posts are sorted. If you choose 'Best', the posts with the largest aggregate 'ups' will be shown first, so you can push a post lower in the queue by down voting it, even though the down votes aren't shown. (unless, of course it has changed again)</comment>

<comment>Down arrow and up arrow are like a thumbs up or down.  It does not really reflect position unless you organize the comments by "best."</comment>

<comment>Wow, and you say I'm being dismissive while you are being downright insulting.</comment>

<comment>Truth can be insulting, but unless you are Muslim who practices Islam, it should not be insulting to you.</comment>

<comment>Actually if they are mere stories, then by definition we don't worship the same God, since the "stories" were written by different authors who were simply making up fictional tales. So your argument supports the position that we don't worship the same God.</comment>

<comment>Your logic is faulty. Yes, those books were written by many different authors, but look at Superman. How many different people have written, drawn, acted, directed Superman? And yet, when you say you're a fan of Superman and I say I'm a fan of Superman, we may be talking about different interpretations, but we are talking about the same character.</comment>

<comment>It's the different interpretations in the stories that make them diverge and they are no longer the same entity. Just because we both call him God it doesn't mean it's the same entity. The whole point of religion is that one group believes in certain traits about God and the other group believes in other traits of God. That alone makes God different in different religions. The God of each religion is not what one so-called prophet claimed, but rather what the people following that God believe in that defines their God. For example, I don't believe a God who condones rape of girls as young as 7 and beheadings, torture, expulsion, murder, etc. is my God and never will be, no matter what you or another tells me. Belief is personal and is not subject to others forcing a certain interpretation upon the believer.</comment>

<comment>You cannot read three stories and conclude they are saying the same thing, when they are opposed to each other in their own language. That's like saying, "Trump and Obama stand for the same thing because they're both politicians". There is MORE disagreement between Islam, Judaism, and Christianity than between any politician on earth.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say that they say the same thing, I said that they refer to the same god. Just with very different interpretations. I Also didn't say that all 3 religions are the same.</comment>

<comment>While I do disagree with they way in which some of your earlier comments were phrased (looked a little bit more than a floor in simple semantics) I think from a logical standpoint you are spot on here.</comment>

<comment>Nope, only one of the Books is really Holy, the Bible, and that is both the Old and the New Testaments. If you don't know the abysmal differences between it and the Quran you clearly have not read any of the two.</comment>

<comment>Nope nope nope nope. The only true religion is whatever religion I believe in. I know this is true because I'm emotionally invested in believing it is.</comment>

<comment>THAT is perhaps the truest thing that may be said of all religions.</comment>

<comment>The true religion is also mentioned by the apostle John. Religion is one of those things that separates us human beings, from the lower creatures in the hierarchies of Creation namely the animals. See, animals have habits and rituals but not religion. However, I rather have a milligram of Faith in God than a Tonne of religion.</comment>

<comment>You are right. There are no christian animals. That's why all of our dead beloved pets are suffering in hell right now. Their flesh will liquefy in lakes of fire for countless millennia. Either that or they just don't have souls.

<comment>Are you're saying that if I read the Holy Bible and the Quran it will be revealed to me that the Bible is the superior of the two?It will be as he wills it.</comment>

<comment>Maybe, who knows!</comment>

<comment>There is that.</comment>

<comment>Only God knows!</comment>

<comment>Really! Judith? Macabees? Gospel of Thomas? Pseudoepigraphica? What texts? What translations? I envy your certitude.</comment>

<comment>The books you mentioned are in the roman-catholic versions and is a worn out argument that's been answered hundreds of times. The Bible used by the Christian churches NOT the one used by the papists/romanists is the one I'm referring to. That's the one.</comment>

<comment>Ah, I thought Catholics were Christians. I don't know what "worn out argument" you are referring to, but I don't get into a lot of these discussions, so I don't doubt there is one.Two other small corrections: The Gospel of Thomas is completely acanonical, and Macabees is not in the Hebrew Bible. Ironic, that.</comment>

<comment>You thought is one thing, knowing, discerning and pointing out the differences is another.</comment>

<comment>The bible is the real holy book to Christians. The Torah is the real holy book to the Jews and the Quran is the only real holy book to Muslims. It's all about perspective.</comment>

<comment>The Torah or the first 5 books of the OT also called Pentateuch are included in the Christian Bible. The Christian Scriptures precede the Quran by more than 600 years. The Torah by at least 1,700. The Doctrines and Teachings of the Bible are far above and beyond the low base of the Quran.</comment>

<comment>While I do disagree with they way in which some of your earlier comments were phrased (looked a little bit more than a floor in simple semantics) I think from a logical standpoint you are spot on here.</comment>

<comment>sorry, posted to the wrong person</comment>

<comment>Except Muhammad didn't write the Quran until 600 years after the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, he had plenty of time to read the Bible first.</comment>

<comment>And Christians and Jews had plenty of time to study pagan mythology before writing the Torah and the New Testament. None of these stories are new.</comment>

<comment>Muhammad didn't "write" the Qur'an. It was revealed to him, and as with the New Testament, it was compiled after his death, some parts kept, others discarded, in keeping the political needs of the compilers. Jesus is accepted by Muslims as a major saint.Followers of each of these faiths believe mistakenly they are in possession of the one true revelation.</comment>

<comment>There's quite a lot of detailed law in Torah without much narrative.</comment>

<comment>But there are stories. Jonah and the Whale is a story. Lot and his wife being turned into salt and his daughters. Moses and the plagues.</comment>

<comment>Oh, of course. Didn't mean to imply there weren't. But there is _a lot_ of Law, to say that Torah is merely a collection of stories is misleading.</comment>

<comment>I have to agree with Proud.You statement insinuates that the books are all stories.If I make the statement "black people are criminals" you could argue that someone having issue with that statement are just crying over semantics.The books and religions are codes of conduct, laws and principles with stories to explain the nature of the one handing the laws down and also in some cases president, metaphors and analogies in order to explain how the law, code of conduct, and principles are applied.Regardless of whether you believe in any form of God or not, or even if you do but do not consider yourself to be religious "A collection of stories" massively over simplifies and leads to insinuations that are quite inaccurate.The books revolve around a story, interpretations of a story, include many stories, use stories are all perfectly accurate, but "ARE" a collection of stories does mislead somewhat in a manner that is a little more than nitpicking.</comment>

<comment>Okay, how about this: The stories included in the 3 holy texts indicate that the divine figure they are referring to is the same character.</comment>

<comment>I couldn't of put it better myself :p</comment>

<comment>Moreover, Islam itself states that Judaism/Christianity/Islam are all part of the same trinity of worship to the same (and only) god.</comment>

<comment>That's OK SpaceMan, be my guest. You can be as dismissive as you like.</comment>

<comment>What's the difference between religion and folktale?</comment>

<comment>Religion is a deity focused folktale. I think that's the main difference if anything.</comment>

<comment>Oh well, gosh, you settled it then. </comment>

<comment>See Ring des Niebelungen is a deity focused tale as are the tales of the norse gods, Athena and her crew, Ra and Isis, etc...</comment>

<comment>I don't think we need dirty focused tales... </comment>

<comment>No, we need dirty unfocused tales.</comment>

<comment>Dirty unhinged tales are even better.</comment>

<comment>Dirty fantasies can be a lot of fun. </comment>

<comment>Ha. My phone is atheist I guess and doesn't like the word deity </comment>

<comment>It's Ring der Nibelungen.......and what's dirty about it?</comment>

<comment>Dwarves. Digging in mines tends to fill your beard with dirt</comment>

<comment>In folktales the deity is often a hidden being disguised as a human trait or object of desire.</comment>

<comment>Actual truth vs moral example.</comment>

<comment>Yes. Christianity is more than a simple moral tradition.</comment>

<comment>I mean, why is this news?  Yes, the 3 religions worship the same God.   Muslims and Jews just dont agree that Jesus was the son of god, but simply another prophet, not unlike the prophet muhammad, whom was also merely a prophet.  Not unlike Abraham, whom was also a prophet (for the jews)Its only Christianity that is so strict, as to say "worship no other god before me" even if that other god is the same god, just through a different prophets interpretation of that god.</comment>

<comment>You were saying that Muslims are less strict than Christians?</comment>

<comment>Nope. Christ is the Son of God, of one spirit with the Father.  He is the Word made flesh, who,lived among us.No other religion, other than christianity, teaches this.  And remember, all the first christians were Jewish people</comment>

<comment>The Greek and Roman myths had plenty of gods who walked around in human form. Their gods also had lots of children with human women. The fact that Christ was a man was the one of the main appeals to the citizens of the Roman Empire. It mirrored their myths in a way the Jewish monotheism didn't.</comment>

<comment>The primary Holy Book of Jews is the Torah, of Muslims it is the same first five Books of the Bible.  Christians kinda cherry-pick their way through the old Testament, keeping what they like and trashing the rest.  Both Jews and Muslims revere Jesus as a Prophet similar to Ezra.</comment>

<comment>Yet the Muslims are taught kill all the Jews in order to bring heaven on earth. I doubt it's the other way around</comment>

<comment>I don't know from Islam, but you are incorrect about Jews. There is a disparaging reference to him in the Talmud.</comment>

<comment>If you are saying that there is a reference to Mohammed in the Talmud, you are dead wrong.  How do I know?  The Talmud is actually two books, the Mishnah and the Gemara.  The former was written in 200AD and the latter in 500AD.  Mohammed lived from 570AD until 623AD.If you are referring to Christ, that is also a little untimely.  There is really no such direct reference, only oblique references that were edited into the Gemara.</comment>

<comment>I was referring to Jesus, sorry about the ambiguity. I agree that the references are obscure and subject to interpretation.</comment>

<comment>But my point remains:  Abraham is considered the father of monotheism.  Solomon is used by some, but Solomon, like David renounced God in his old age.  But all three religions --- Judaism, Christianity, and Islam all trace directly back to Abraham.  The Pentateuch is the most important Holly Book in both Judaism and Islam and only behind the Gospels for Christians.  All three religions are in accord in revering the Psalms.  The Talmud and the Koran are strikingly similar because they were both extensions (interpretations?) of the Pentateuch.  And Talmudic Law and Sharia Law are very similar for the same reason.Personally I believe that all three religions see the same God from different perspectives (along with many other religions.)  Theologically the ability to see and worship God from different standpoints is one of the more powerful influences that has kept all three religions very similar (at least until mabe35 years ago.)</comment>

<comment>Your reply does not seem to have anything to do with my comment, which was about Jesus in the Talmud.What you say is interesting. It's hard to think that "Talmudic Law and Sharia are very similar", but I am not familiar with Sharia.Best wishes to you,</comment>

<comment>And a Happy Holidays to you as well.</comment>

<comment>Jesus is Lord, the Son of God</comment>

<comment>Then someone's believing in the actual truth of an instructive fable 'elevates' (for lack of a better word) folktale to religion?</comment>

<comment>You believe that one is true and the other is false.</comment>

<comment>The severity of belief by the people who tell the stories.</comment>

<comment>Lol, yet its historically accurate, liberal or no. Open a Bible and get a clue</comment>

<comment>Is it? How? On what? There is at least one demonstrable error I know of.OTOH, the Iliad was historically accurate, at least in part.</comment>

<comment>And that means what?The typical conservative response to religion is to regard it as an excuse for conquest.</comment>

<comment>And the liberal was already here ready for a fight regardless of the reason.</comment>

<comment>Liberal? Fight?Nah....the best they can do is sneer from behind their keyboards.</comment>

<comment>So now the Bible is Liberal or Conservative? I'm pretty sure you're hellbound for that one.  The Bible clearly states the family tree and WE both originate from the house of Abraham.  The difference is that we believe that Jesus Christ came to take away our sin and he is the son of God.  But still Jesus is part of the whole, ever living God in the Three in one, trinity. The truth is that they may worship God differently, the but they still believe that Jesus Christ was sent by God, just not as God himself.  You really need to do your homework before you pretend to know your Bible. Here's a thought why don't you stop taking the minister's advice as to what's in there and read it yourself. I'm sure they would recommend the same thing.</comment>

<comment>telling people they are hellbound is enough to get you there yourself, chief</comment>

<comment>How did you know I was native American?  Oh and I was just making an observation.  It's not my decision.</comment>

<comment>Please stop calling all unbelievers liberals.  There are many who voted for Obama because they despise the hate-filled Republican party and value the poor, but yet believe the gospel of God's grace.  Unbelief is not politically and socially conservative or liberal; it is unbelief, and I can hate some of the things Democrats do and still support them as a whole in other areas.</comment>

<comment>Giving people jobs is more compassionate than handouts because it keeps them fed without the sluggard's death.</comment>

<comment>Also, get rid of the minimum wage and the ACA.</comment>

<comment>Sure are a lot of us absolutely convinced it's all folktale! There's no verifiable historic proof, other than these campfire tales that God, Moses, Paul, Jesus, Mary, etc ever existed.  Heck, verifiable history of the authorship of any one of the Books of the Bible also totally lacking.  No one knows who wrote Matthew, Mark, Luke or John, the principle stories of Jesus. Even the questionable existing disciples of Jesus were dead decades before the first book of the future New Testament came into existence.  These campfire tales were eventually written down, translated, copied, edited, translated again, copied, rewritten, typeset, printed, edited, reprinted, translated, etc.  So please don't try to tell me 6,000+ years of "God" inspired men creating these books haven't twisted, modified and reinvented these folktale to manipulate and answer the ignorant's questions and superstitions (and make a lot of money in the process!)</comment>

<comment>religion is a folk tale, read these comments, it's full of mush brains trying to justify these myths.</comment>

<comment>yeah Anton....being a troll is sooo much mo' better.Why not head on back over to TVGuide and comment on reallllly important stuff?</comment>

<comment>Well it was. Are you suggesting that books like Genesis and Exodus etc are literally true? The more accurate word is "myth". A myth is not necessarily false. It is a story told to teach a lesson.</comment>

<comment>Actually you have a point. If Jesus was running for the Presidential elections today, Cruz and Rubio and Trump would have nailed him to a cross a long time ago for being a filthy liberal, or even worse, would be spitting out his name along with Hilary's.

<comment>Your typical response to anything is to talk out your ass.</comment>

<comment>Jews and Christians worship the same god and Muslims acknowledge both Jesus and Abraham.</comment>

<comment>I think you mean "fairytale".  It's all fiction.</comment>

<comment>NOT BEING OVERLY RELIGIOUS HOWEVER I WAS TAUGHT THE SAME THING THAT JEWS MUSLIMS AND CHRISTIANS ALL WORSHIP THE GOD OF ABRAHAM--NOTE THAT YOU MOST LIKELY DON'T SAY THAT THE GOD OF THE JEWS AND CHRISTIANS  ARE NOT ONE IN THE SAME --USING THE ARGUMENT THAT THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION GOD HAD A SON VS THE JEWS THAT DON'T RECOGNIZE JESUS AS THE SON OF GOD YET YOU SHOULD HAVE NO ISSUE WITH CALLING HIM THE SAME--SO HOW IS IT WRONG TO SAY THAT THEY ARE THE SAME?</comment>

<comment>Folklore is a generous way to put it. I prefer to call it fairy tales for children or adults with the mentality of children.</comment>

<comment>You mean that all that stuff about feeding thousands of people with a couple of fish and one bun is true? Was the universe really made in six days? I wonder why I find it hard to believe something so obviously true?</comment>

<comment>No dude, they literally all use the same books from the Old Testament and believe in all the Old Testament prophets!  Typical ignorant conservative response haha!</comment>

<comment>And just where do you think religion came from if not from the invention of week minded fools?</comment>

<comment>Well, ISN'T IT?Actually, it is more child like than that. More like Grimm's Fairy Tales. Or is that Grim Fairy Tales?</comment>

<comment>Religion is not a folktale.  Religion is a system of belief in folktales.  Educated people want facts, not fiction.</comment>

<comment>However, Christians believe that Jesus is divine, the Son of the Abrahamic God.  Neither Jews nor Muslims believe this.  That is the key point of difference between the 3.</comment>

<comment>They kind of have a point. Why worship the son when we could be worshiping the big cheese himself?</comment>

<comment>Because Jesus and the Father are One Being, according to the Bible. He is equally God, according to Scripture.</comment>

<comment>Which is why, when you pray, "God grant us this in Jesus name", you are actually praying. "God grant us this in your name."</comment>

<comment>This doesn't cause an insuperable amount of consternation because in most Christian theology, the son -is- the big cheese himself. Or, I guess more technically, we could say the big cheese himself is of one substance but expressed in three persons, of whom the father and the son are two.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I always feel bad for the Holy Spirit. He's always getting left out</comment>

<comment>Like Hades with the short straw while Poseidon and Zeus ride 12 deep on Olympus.</comment>

<comment>"No one who denies the Son has the Father; whoever acknowledges the Son has the Father also" 1 John 2:23</comment>

<comment>Correct.</comment>

<comment>While this is true, that Muslims and Jews do not beleive that Jesus was anything more than a regular "David Blaine"of his time...  They do in fact, acknowledge that there is one god, the same god they worship..    there were merely preached by different prophets, the prophet Jesus, the Prophet Muhammad..  and sons of Abraham.</comment>

<comment>Muslims recognize Jesus as a great prophet, entitled to Peace Be Upon Him just like Muhammad gets. (PBUH)</comment>

<comment>But the god is the same. Whether or not you believe that Jesus is an extension of God.</comment>

<comment>correct!  but it's also not the issue.  the issue is that it's the same God that all 3 worship.  they each worship that God in different ways and have very different beliefs about that God and what it means to be a believer.  but its the same God.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure this is so.  The Christian God is Triune - Father, Son and Holy Spirit in One Person.  The Jewish God and Allah are singular beings.  So is it really "the same God?"</comment>

<comment>let me try this- is there some other God that any of these 3 religions believe in?  don't get lost in the Trinity issue- it's one God in 3 'forms'.  when I teach it to kids in sunday school I use an analogy to the properties of water- liquid, vapor, solid- all water.  it's the same God.  but very, very different beliefs about that God and about worshipping that God.</comment>

<comment>OK - good analogy about the properties of water.  I can see that.</comment>

<comment>yeah, it's not original- don't remember where I borrowed it from, but it works like a charm.  at least on a basic level.  maybe not so worthwhile in a theology class.  but it gets the concept across.</comment>

<comment>I'm an atheist, but that's a pretty clever way of explaining the Trinity. Beats the hell out of Saint Paddy and his shamrock.Good work.</comment>

<comment>Then you would likely be teaching a form of heresy called modalism because theologically, the water example is actually non-Trinitarian.  It implies that the only difference is the form (i.e. God can be liquid OR solid OR vapor).  The concept of the triune Godhead states that the 3 persons coexist simultaneously (more akin to saying God IS liquid AND solid AND vapor).Of course, the whole thing makes no sense anyway.</comment>

<comment>yeah, I can see your point.  that's the reason for the 'form' thingy.  it's not about the form, correct. the IS and AND's are also correct.  like I said, not for a theology class, but I have yet to have a student who didn't "get it" almost immediately.  God is the liquid.  God is the vapor.  God is the ice.  pretty simple-  I dunno, like I said- the kids get it.</comment>

<comment>Volksverdummung at the very early stages, shameshameshame</comment>

<comment>let's stick to English.  got a better example a young kid might be able to get their head around?</comment>

<comment>The nature of the Trinity took several centuries for the early Christian Church to resolve, through theological debates and physical conflicts.  (The Orthodox Church never got completely on board, as I understand it.)  By the time of the Protestant Reformation, the doctrine of Trinity was no longer controversial and was not part of the conflict with Rome.As others have noted, neither Muslims nor Jews accept the concept of Trinity nor the divinity of Jesus.  Muslims accord Jesus the status of Prophet.  Jews see him at best as a rabbi, but not an important one during the first century when rabbinic oral law was being codified and committed to written form to support a people on the edge of diaspora.I can understand how a Christian College could have issues with faculty who equate the God of all three religions.  If the Gods are identical, how can Christians and Muslims explain the differences in theology, doctrines, and laws that distinguish the faiths?  (Jews resolve the conflict by saying that Jewish law and observance are incumbent only on Jews.)</comment>

<comment>One God. Three religions which have different views of that God, and different forms of worship. Not really that hard to understand.</comment>

<comment>No, that is a simplistic misunderstanding.  They are not just "different views", they are fundamental disagreements on the nature of God.  Would you similarly accept that Charles Manson or Jim Jones merely espoused different forms of worship of the same God?</comment>

<comment>Never read the parable of the Blind Men and the Elephant, have you? The US has Democrats, Republicans and Independents (and others, but those are the major groupings), who all view the country in different ways, and have different goals, as well as beliefs about what the Constitution means, BUT, when we pledge allegiance, it is to the same flag, representing the same country. The two you mention, and some others I could bring up as well, were simply  splinter cults based on the leaders' childhood religion.</comment>

<comment>Christianity itself began as a splinter cult of Judaism, so I fail to see how that serves your argument.The country is a tangible thing - we may have differing views about the nature of its people, its values and so forth, but it's not a debatable concept.  God is not a tangible thing, it's a concept.  When you have very different definitions of a concept, you end up with separate concepts.  They share commonalities of origin in the Semitic tradition, but are otherwise very different.In short, the parable of the blind men and the elephant works only because of the reader's a priori knowledge of the elephant.  There's no such equivalence with God or the Flying Spaghetti Monster because there is no such knowledge.</comment>

<comment>The country called the United States is not a tangible thing, it is a concept, created by men to mean something. It just means different things to different people. It is an idea. Very much like God in the way people argue (sometimes violently) over the 'proper' interpretation of it. You have completely missed the point of the blind men and the elephant.</comment>

<comment>It's a physical land mass, it contains people - I assure you that it's most tangible  Of course there are many conceptual ideas around it, but it's not *just* an idea.  There is no part of God that is tangible or knowable in any way.  Therefore, no person can claim to have any real knowledge of God, either in part or whole, rendering the analogy useless.</comment>

<comment>like scotch, rocks and the angels share</comment>

<comment>Except not all Christians agree that their God is a trinity. This is true of sects ancient (Arian, Cathar), and modern (United Church, Christian Scientists)</comment>

<comment>Jehovah's Witnesses are said to go with the Arian thing. They also don't deify the Holy Spirit.</comment>

<comment>Not all christian denominations view God as a trinity.</comment>

<comment>The issue at hand is what does Wheaton College require as belief.</comment>

<comment>...........council-fabricated (man-made) divinity is better than none at'all.............</comment>

<comment>But if Christians say that the son and the father are one in the same God, and Muslims believe in the same God, but in one entity, isn't it still, at the bottom line, the same God? Or let me put it this way, shouldn't a person be able to make that argument in an institution of higher learning without being FIRED?</comment>

<comment>Yes!  I would love to hear her argument.I can easily argue they are different, if their character is drastically different, as it is, what does it mean to say they are the same entity?  The logical answer is that The Prophet copied the Christian God, but since his sources were heretics and he himself was illiterate, he got it mostly wrong.</comment>

<comment>And surely you have a right to that opinion. I would not pretend to be well versed enough in theology to say you are right or she is right (and even if I did it would still only be an opinion), but I think there are many who hold bother her opinion and yours, and no one should lose their job over that.</comment>

<comment>I do not want to discourage free speech.  For this professor to take a public position on a subject directly related to her employer, I think she should be prepared to elaborate on her thinking.  A professor who cannot reason and communicate sufficiently to provide a good defense of their position is not qualified to be a professor.</comment>

<comment>And where is your evidence that they gave her that opportunity and she couldn't? I see nothing in this article indicating that the school did anything other than suspend her. If they gave her a chance to do defend her position before suspending her, that wasn't reported in this article.</comment>

<comment>No.  Abraham told me so.</comment>

<comment>Tell him I say hey.</comment>

<comment>What does that even mean if it all based on fiction.  No Jesus was a copy of Egyptian Sun God Horus merged with a lot of local fictional stuffThe sun-god Horus was worshipped nearly 1,000 years before the story of Jesus. Check these parallels:""1.Both were conceived of a virgin.2.Both were the "only begotten son" of a god (either Osiris or Yahweh)3.Horus's mother was Meri, Jesus's mother was Mary.4.Horus's foster father was called Jo-Seph, and Jesus's foster father was Joseph.5.Both foster fathers were of royal descent.6.Both were born in a cave (although sometimes Jesus is said to have been born in a stable).7.Both had their coming announced to their mother by an angel.Horus; birth was heralded by the star Sirius (the morning star). Jesus had his birth heralded by a star in the East (the sun rises in the East).8.Ancient Egyptians celebrated the birth of Horus on December 21 (the Winter Solstice). Modern Christians celebrate the birth of Jesus on December 25.9.Both births were announced by angels (this si nto the same as number 7).10.Both had shepherds witnessing the birth.11.Horus was visited at birth by "three solar deities" and Jesus was visited by "three wise men".12.After the birth of Horus, Herut tried to have Horus murdered. After the birth of Jesus, Herod tried to have Jesus murdered.13.To hide from Herut, the god That tells Isis, "Come, thou goddess Isis, hide thyself with thy child." To hide from Herod, an angel tells Joseph to "arise and take the young child and his mother and flee into Egypt."14.When Horus came of age, he had a special ritual where hsi eye was restored. When Jesus (and other Jews) come of age, they have a special ritual called a Bar Mitzvah.15.Both Horus and Jesus were 12 at this coming-of-age ritual.Neither have any official recorded life histories between the ages of 12 and 30.16.Horus was baptized in the river Eridanus. Jesus was baptized in the river Jordan.17.Both were baptized at age 30.18.Horus was baptized by Anup the Baptizer. Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist.19.Both Anup and John were later beheaded.20.Horus was taken from the desert of Amenta up a high mountain to be tempted by his arch-rival Set. Jesus was taken from the desert in Palestine up a high mountain to be tempted by his arch-rival Satan.21.Both Horus and Jesus successfully resist this temptation.22.Both have 12 disciples.23.Both walked on water, cast out demons, healed the sick, and restored sight to the blind.24.Horus "stilled the sea by his power." Jesus commanded the sea to be still by saying, "Peace, be still."25.Horus raised his dead father (Osiris) from the grave. Jesus raised Lazarus from the grave. (Note the similarity in names when you say them out loud. Further, Osiris was also known as Asar, which is El-Asar in Hebrew, which is El-Asarus in Latin.)26.Osiris was raised in the town of Anu. Lazarus was raised in Bethanu (literally, "house of Anu").27.Both gods delivered a Sermon on the Mount.28.Both were crucified.29.Both were crucified next to two thieves.30.Both were buried in a tomb.31.Horus was sent to Hell and resurrected in 3 days. Jesus was sent to Hell and came back "three days" later (although Friday night to Sunday morning is hardly three days).32.Both had their resurrection announced by women.33.Both are supposed to return for a 1000-year reign.34.Horus is known as KRST, the anointed one. Jesus was known as the Christ (which means "anointed one").35.Both Jesus and Horus have been called the good shepherd, the lamb of God, the bread of life, the son of man, the Word, the fisher, and the winnower.36.Both are associated with the zodiac sign of Pisces (the fish).37.Both are associated with the symbols of the fish, the beetle, the vine, and the shepherd's crook.38.Horus was born in Anu ("the place of bread") and Jesus was born in Bethlehem ("the house of bread").39."The infant Horus was carried out of Egypt to escape the wrath of Typhon. The infant Jesus was carried into Egypt to escape the wrath of Herod. Concerning the infant Jesus, the New Testament states the following prophecy: 'Out of Egypt have I called my son.'"40.Both were transfigured on the mount.41.The catacombs of Rome have pictures of the infant Horus being held by his mother, not unlike the modern-day images of "Madonna and Child."Noted English author C. W. King says that both Isis and Mary are called "Immaculate".42.Horus says: "Osiris, I am your son, come to glorify your soul, and to give you even more power." And Jesus says: "Now is the Son of Man glorified and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will glorify the Son in himself, and will glorify him at once."Horus was identified with the Tau (cross).""http://hubpages.com/religion-p...</comment>

<comment>Amazing list of coincidences. However, may I point out your error? A cave can be used as a stable, so that is not a conflict.</comment>

<comment>God forbid that there be cultural pluralism or transfers, in remote history or present day, as we don't know and eat tortillas, bologna, our cowboys don't use la riata, or we don't have K-12 where K=Kindergarten. Well, at least we carry backpacks these days instead of a Rucksack, but we obviously still suffer from Weltschmerz, as these comments all clearly show......</comment>

<comment>I believe his only point is that the Horus story existed at least 1000 years before the Jesus story came around. This makes it pretty obvious there was really no Jesus OR Jesus didn't have as great a real story so they just attributed a bunch of stuff to him that was from another God's story.</comment>

<comment>If you take the Horus thing seriously, which you shouldn't, because it's not actually an accurate description of the mythology surrounding Horus.  To quote Wikipedia on the subject:Not exactly the virgin birth of the New Testament.  The rest of the comparisons are also largely tenuous.</comment>

<comment>My personal belief is there was a Jesus. His legacy was embellished all to hell though in order not to be overshadowed by the Jewish Martyrs during the second half of the First Century. BUT, that is my belief which means there is insufficient evidence to back it up.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for that amusing list.  I would like to add to the entertainment two thoughts:That must have been some miracle for the early Christians to have dug up 1000 years of Egyptian history in order to combines bits and pieces of the various Horus stories.  Did you know the Google search engine had not been developed much less populated with centuries of archaeology which had not yet occurred?Early Christians died horrible deaths.  They could have saved themselves by confessing the real story.  What was their motivation?  Wealth and power?  Really?</comment>

<comment>The only conclusion can be Christian church of early eras would have used the beliefs present in local population in Egypt and surrounding  to populate the content of their books.     I believe that it was Alvin Boyd Kuhn ( an expert in comparative religion)  as well Gerrad Massey were  the major gurus  who figured the correlation between the two deities but  it was buried till it revived by some videos on internet and then people started digging.</comment>

<comment>You pushed it back a layer, to the Egyptians, but where did they learn of the beliefs that had been dead for a thousand years?  The point is that you are extracting bits and pieces from disjoint stories most of which had been long obsolete by that time.</comment>

<comment>The Egyptian methodology was translated from  Egyptian hieroglyphics in British museums like  the Book of Dead.What you are saying does not even add up because these are more original that the bibles.https://upload.wikimedia.org/w...some of the keyshttp://www.resurrectisis.org/J...Here is some of text stuff available online http://www.pyramidtextsonline....Papyrus of Anihttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Proof that the original Xtians were a bunch if no-talent hacks!!</comment>

<comment>Too lazy to write a new script</comment>

<comment>Yeah, none of the stories in the bible are original. Almost every religion has a great flood myth, for example.</comment>
