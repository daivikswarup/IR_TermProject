<comment>Newsflash : "Gay American" former governor of New Jersey McGreevey endorses Rubio. Not that there is anything wrong with that.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that the one who.........</comment>

<comment>... most people never heard of, and those who did have forgotten. Spud indulges his talent for non-sequitur.Trump and Christie give new meaning to the phrase bully pulpit. This twist reminds me of reality competition shows like Top Chef or Project Runway, when   eliminated contestants return near the end to act as sous chefs/sewers for the last few contenders.</comment>

<comment>He's a funny tater.</comment>

<comment>The hyper aggressive non English speaking aliens you see clogging up traffic all over  this country doing landscape work  are 99.9 percent illegal aliens. They can't be vetted like Americans. There is no social security number that tracks them for life in the countries they are from. You have no way to know if they are murderers, child molesters, or the anti Christ, because the third world hovels they are from are not automated and don't keep records. You really can't reliably vet individuals from third world societies. Even the millions of Indian computer programmers imported to the US can't be vetted. That's why they should all be deported and only the best allowed back in, after they have been thru a meaningful vetting process, that must be devised. Also, when corporations bring unvetted individuals into our society, they should assume liablility in the form of some type of bond.</comment>

<comment>The trouble for some Americans is because many of the Aliens invading the USA have brains that actually work. And benefit the land!</comment>

<comment>You obviously don't know what you are talking about and I won't waste time trying to school you. People like you are part of the problem and a big reason why RINOS, DINOS, and DONORS have gotten away with what they have been doing for so long. Fortunately, people like you are becoming a smaller and smaller part of the voting population. Very soon we will see  whose point of view prevails; mine or yours. Maybe you can move to that hell hole called India, after Donald Trump becomes president. Fat chance, because India won't have you; they beg and they take, but they don't give. I hope you find a place in the third world that will take you, because the USA will be better off without your type. Make America Great Again for Americans !!! TRUMP 2016 !!!</comment>

<comment>What's your point?  Is McGreevey's sexual orientation at all salient to his alleged endorsement?</comment>

<comment>It matters to some people in a positive way, to others in a negative way. Let's not ignore it.</comment>

<comment>If he were straight, would you mention his sexuality?</comment>

<comment>For some people, this is a positive endorsement. It could go either way.</comment>

<comment>Shows that Republicans don't believe in anything anymore.</comment>

<comment>Trump supporters don't believe in anything anymore.  Actual conservatives believe in the Constitution, limited government, traditional marriage, the right to life, the right to deny medical care to others, and the right to bear arms.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you've really got to hand it to Rubio and Cruz for standing up for their core conservative values  at the debate last night and demanding people be left to die on the sidewalks.</comment>

<comment>You're right.  We should be handing out free prosthetics like they're candy.  Never mind the fact that they cost an arm and a leg.</comment>

<comment>That is about what they cost, isn't it? I guess I can't argue with you there.</comment>

<comment>I'm hoping this line about prostetics costing "an arm and a leg" is an intentional pun, not a real complaint about cost.Otherwise, your argument won't have a leg to stand on. For we can surely foot the bill.</comment>

<comment>that's just cubanadian economics</comment>

<comment>There is no right to medical care, iPhones, college tuition, or mortgages, despite what nit wit politicians tell you.</comment>

<comment>It must be tough!   You remind me of those Comcast commercials about "settlers!"ROFLMAO! </comment>

<comment>there's no 'point'.  Trump's campaign is just a campaign by a bully for bullies.  This is what they do.</comment>

<comment>OMG, the Democrats are the biggest brain-bullies around.  Seriously, somebody needs to park 10 million in my checking account to compensate me for all the lib-toxicity I've inadvertently-ingested for the last 7 year on mainstream forums.  Trump is a fat pussycat by comparison. </comment>

<comment>A review of your bully's tweets suggests otherwise.  No other candidate behaves like a strutting schoolyard bully, and no other candidates supporters mimic and amplify him in this same way.  Congratulations, you and your candidate have turned presidential campaigning into a third grade recess yard.  http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02...®ion=top-news&WT.nav=top-news</comment>

<comment>You make my case, Spinner.  You're such a passive-aggressive brain-bully with this ^.</comment>

<comment>Pointing out Trump's bullying makes me a bully.  Whoops, I mean a brain-bully.  Gotcha.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps I am being too generous with the "brain-bully" umbrella in your case lol</comment>

<comment>Just because they confront you with actual,  you know,  FACTS doesn't really qualify them as 'bullies.' </comment>

<comment>Probably the most succinct and accurate explanation for the Trump phenomenon I've heard.</comment>

<comment>Given the GOP's shifting position on gay rights, this is relevant.</comment>

<comment>Only insofar as they want to use it to discriminate against someone.</comment>

<comment>Perverts have poor judgement.</comment>

<comment>Rubio now has the support of a homosexual man- behind -him.</comment>

<comment>Not even New Jersey democrats care what Jim McGreevey has to say.</comment>

<comment>spudwhisperer: you've lied about me twice and then clammed up when called on it. Would you like to take this opportunity to show even the slightest bit of integrity?</comment>

<comment>YOU are Jim McGreevey? WTF?</comment>

<comment>spudwhisperer: thank you for showing that you have no integrity.You've replied to two of my recent comments, lying about me and helping the pro-amnesty side in the process. One of my faults is I don't lie, even little white lies. I can't imagine having no honor, no integrity, no cojones. For you, having no honor, no integrity, and no cojones is a way of life.</comment>

<comment>WTF?  Who the hell are you?  Why would I give a sh*t about some random internet dufus like you - to care enough to take the trouble to make up a lie.I would have to at least care about your existence to want to lie about you, right?</comment>

<comment>spudwhisperer:Once again, thank you for showing that you have no integrity. If anyone's interested I can post the links where you lie about me. If you had any integrity you'd look through your past comments to find them.This is all beyond my understanding: I can't imagine having no honor.</comment>

<comment>Believe me, no-one is interested in either your links or your mental illness.</comment>

<comment>I heard KYJelly plans to sponsor a Rubio car in NASCAR.  Or maybe it was Vaseline?  Then again Rubio may prefer sponsorship from an outfit selling products with lower lubricity -- like, say, *ahem* "Louisville Slugger."  </comment>

<comment>Of for heaven's sake what's 'gay' about gay?So a homosexual anoints Rubio, so what.</comment>

<comment>Did the Rube apply for the priesthood?</comment>

<comment>Why is this surprisingly to you? The foam party king - Marco Rubio. http://tinyurl.com/jt6lb4r</comment>

<comment>Christie's sheer mass just means that gravity slowly pulls supporters over to Trump.</comment>

<comment>Of course he did.  VP Christie ain't stupid.</comment>

<comment>President Cruz won't choose Christie for VP.  Sorry.</comment>

<comment>Snikering quietly.</comment>

<comment>There are more delegates in Texas alone than in all of the states won by Trump combined.  And Cruz already won Iowa.Ted Cruz for President 2016 and 2020</comment>

<comment>He'll basically end up splitting Texas delegates with Trump and then he's got nowhere to go from there.</comment>

<comment>He'll take the lion's share in Texas.  And he has a big enough war chest to weather Trump's self-inflicted destruction.Ted Cruz for President 2016 and 2020</comment>

<comment>He's a regional candidate. He can't win in the rust-belt, the northeast or on the west coast. He's hit his ceiling. He's done.</comment>

<comment>Cruz will wear Christie's soft, supple skin as a coat when he accepts the nomination.</comment>

<comment>Lol. It would be keeping with the 35% of Florida voters who think he was the Zodiac killer.</comment>

<comment>Stick a fork in him.</comment>

<comment>That sounds mouthwatering.  The taste of... mmm, you wouldn't understand.Ted Cruz for President 2016 and 2020</comment>

<comment>Everyone has a right to a point of view. But, based on the simple words in the Constitution, Ted Cruz is a Canadian immigrant.</comment>

<comment>I'm going to go with "no."  The constitution doesn't contain the words "Ted Cruz," "Canadian," or "immigrant."Some have claimed that Ted Cruz's birth was unnatural -- occult, even -- but I remain unconvinced.  Or at least I doubt that it can be proven.Ted Cruz for President 2016 and 2020</comment>

<comment>I don't think that's true. Children born to service members abroad are natural born citizens.</comment>

<comment>And after TX? Hard to believe but Cruz was actually caught lying. What do you see in this guy? He's obnoxious.</comment>

<comment>It sounds like you're jealous of a very intelligent, very successful man.  Or maybe it's fear.</comment>

<comment>Any success he appears to have attained thru merit is tainted by his ties to Bushleague neo-warcons.</comment>

<comment>George Bush hates Ted Cruz.  http://www.politico.com/story/...He called Cruz opportunistic.  Others in the Bush campaign said that Cruz was "completely taken with himself and his own ideas."  One campaign staffer said "the quickest way for a meeting to end would be for Ted to come in. People would want out of that meeting. People wouldn't go to a meeting if they knew he would be there. It was his inability to be part of the team. That's exactly what he was: a big a-hole." http://www.motherjones.com/pol...I dare you to find one "Bushleage neo-warcon" who likes Cruz or would back him up.Ted Cruz for President 2016 and 2020</comment>

<comment>False flag operation -- Cruz being beholdin' to Texan business says volumes.</comment>

<comment>Let's see  This is the guy who said Chuck Hagel was in the pay of North Korea and neither produced proof nor apologized who said Ben Carson was stopping his campaign just before a primary and doctored a photo to show Rubio shaking hands with Obama.</comment>

<comment>No one has proven that Chuck Hagel isn't being paid by North Koreans.Blah, blah, blah on the rest of your crap.Cruz is a guy who knows how to get ahead.  And you resent him for that.</comment>

<comment>The burden of proof is on the one person who made the accusation since no one else has and no proof has been produced as well as being on the face ridiculous.  You are too young to know about Joe McCarthy who went around calling people communists whom no one else including the House UnAmerican Activities Committee and J. Edgar Hoover identified as Communists.  He ruined many innocent lives.What Ted Cruz said was McCarthyism pure and simple.  Fortunately we live in saner times than the 1950s.  However, that and his dirty campaign tricks show that Cruz is an evil man.</comment>

<comment>"A political science professor at Long Island’s Stoney Brook University believes the statistical odds of businessman Donald Trump becoming the next president are between 97 and 99 percent ... In contrast, the model predicted that if either Texas Sen. Ted Cruz or Florida Sen. Marco Rubio were the GOP nominee, Clinton would narrowly edge out both candidates in a general election..."http://www.theblaze.com/storie...cross your fingers!</comment>

<comment>That'd be great. A President who acts like and who's paid "certain people", and a VP who had a member of that group in his family.The smart thing to do would be to ask if Christie now supports Trump's crazy plans. Has he changed his mind on Trump's Muslims plan?In case anyone would like to actually do something, urge reporters on Twitter to do that and discredit them if they won't ask such questions.</comment>

<comment>Will Rubio cry like a little girl next Tuesday when announces the end of his campaign?</comment>

<comment>Nahhh...he'll wait till Wednesday.</comment>

<comment>Will he wear his high heels?</comment>

<comment>Maybe he'll start modeling rubeeeeeo red pant suits.</comment>

<comment>There'll be a lot of water for sure.</comment>

<comment>So, you use "like a little girl" as a pejorative? I hope you never have a daughter. For her sake.</comment>

<comment>Behaving like a little girl is fine, unless you happen to be a grown man.</comment>

<comment>you've never seen the phrase "like a little girl" before? what are you, ten?</comment>

<comment>He's a young man who looks even younger than he is.  He's got a long way to go and lots of time to run for office.</comment>

<comment>He's also a mental lilliputian.He'll be unemployed and the state will be supporting him within a decade.Ted Cruz for President 2016 and 2020</comment>

<comment>He's a lot brighter than you, smarter than you, and definitely quicker than you.  Hmm.... that's not a great comparison.</comment>

<comment>You've just listed three synonyms for the same damn thing.Do you really think you're qualified to judge anyone's intelligence, Sarita?</comment>

<comment>Not sure if everyone, but certainly your limited one.</comment>

<comment>What became of your lamb, Sarita, when he faced off against Christie?"Let's dispel... let's dispel..." *stutter, stutter, derp*.  Someone please shoot this wounded lamb and take it out of our misery.</comment>

<comment>You think I care, but I seriously don't.  I was a Democrat until last year.  Last year I decided to vote for any Republican chosen to run.  That's when I switched parties.</comment>

<comment>Everyone on every politically forum was a "Democrat until last year" or a "Republican until last year."You were a lost liberal last year and you still are.  Spare us the phony political turnaround story.  There is only one conservative candidate remaining in the race, and if you don't support him, you're not the real deal.</comment>

<comment>Really now.  'Cause I've been a Democrat all my life and I've never run into anyone till recently who was a Democrat and switched parties except for Trump, and I don't know the man.Let me add something.  My family did make the switch along with me.  </comment>

<comment>Try spelling Reagan; he wasn't well regarded by the truly senile RNC either.</comment>

<comment>That makes two.  And?</comment>

<comment>He's about to be out of the Senate. He'll be even more of a nothing-burger then.</comment>

<comment>We'll see.  I've got to have a lot of good Republicans available to vote for, since I will not be voting for any libs until:  1) the PC bullsh*t is dead and gone; and, 2) The Muslims are long gone and history.</comment>

<comment>He's giving up his seat. Done deal.</comment>

<comment>Ok ok, you win.  You've made me so depressed that I just don't know what to do!  In fact I'm so sad that I'm just going to have to start voting for liberals again.  lol</comment>

<comment>At least we can laugh.</comment>

<comment>That's true.  Everyone needs that.   :)</comment>

<comment>He's just a stale cuban sandwich with a Mccarthyite odor.</comment>

<comment>Can we please stop saying Trump "hijacked" conservatism now?He is conservatism. They are one.</comment>

<comment>I think a better analysis would be: Tribalism > Ideology.</comment>

<comment>Or that conservatism as an ideology is fundamentally tribal.</comment>

<comment>What Tribalism is that?</comment>

<comment>Actually, "Trumpism" shows that conservatism isn't working for most people:24ahead.com/n/12104I'd like to think someone who's neither conventionally liberal or conservative like Marine Le Pen would do very well in the U.S., except I don't think most people would be able to understand her (even if she learned English).</comment>

<comment>I am he as you are me and we are all together.</comment>

<comment>I'm watching Trump right now, joint appearance with Christie Kreme. Gotta say, this has sucked all of the oxygen out of the post-debate air. The Donald is yelling away with heightened verve.</comment>

<comment>This is definitely big for Trump. It totally cancels the media narrative of him getting attacked at the debate, and instead replaces it with all these breathless stories about Christie's endorsement. The media loves them some drama, and this is a juicy one - not just because it's Trump's highest profile endorsement to date, but because it's one of the former "establishment lane" candidates, implying that Rubio is going to have trouble sewing up that vote, which he is absolutely relying on. Bush isn't very likely to endorse, since he's probably still holding a grudge against his former padawan Rubio for upstaging him, even if he dislikes Trump.Now all people are going to be talking about the rest of today and into the weekend is Christie endorsing Trump, and how this hurts Rubio, and how Trump is winning. We've already seen a few congressmen endorse Trump, and there's probably more coming.</comment>

<comment>I can't wait for the celebrity endorsements to start coming in for Trump: Chuck Norris, Kid Rock, </comment>

<comment>Don't forget Hulk Hogan, David Duke, the Five Families, Paul LePage, no doubt. There's your VP!</comment>

<comment>Im surprised at this. Simply because I think that Trump  destroyed what chances that Christie  had of winning. .Rubio has appealed to theose who think that the Republicans need younger and fresher faces.Cruz has appealed to Republicans who don't like compromise.Kasich appeals to Republicans  who want fiscal    conservatism .Jeb Bush didn't really appeal to anyone. So that's why he  had to drop out.Carson appeals to social conservatives.And Christie  wanted to appeal  to Republicans who wanted a guy who "Tells it like it is". Christie was running as the brash guy that didn't care what anyone thought of him.And Trump obviously outdid himSo while I don't think that Trump really hurt Bush that much[Bush was over rated from the start]I do think that he  destroyed Christie's campaign.By basicly stealing Christie's theme.</comment>

<comment>Christie feels that the Rubio Superpac attack adds in NH hurt his chances.  He was running as an establishment candidate just like Rubio.</comment>

<comment>I'm not surprised at all...i was actually just thinking the other night it would be a likely alliance, considering how much Christie has dumped on Rubio/the establishment in the past. Trump and Christie both have the "angry white male" schtick, but Trump has just been way more successful with it.</comment>

<comment>As the others said, Christie probably feels that his chances were torpedoed more by Rubio and the others than Trump. There's probably also a degree of tri-state area cultural familiarity. That, and Christie probably figures that Trump is going to win, going to play a big role in the Republican party going forward even if he doesn't win in November, and figures that he (Christie) is otherwise on the road to nowhere. This puts him back in the spotlight.</comment>

<comment>Cold-blooded Christie just hijacked the best news cycle Rubio has had in weeks--he must really hate him.</comment>

<comment>Trump is savvy. He's had Christie sewn up for a while. He just waited for the right time to roll out his endorsement.</comment>

<comment>So right. The Christie attacks on Rubio at his last debate make more sense now.</comment>

<comment>Who cares if Trump hired Polish illegal immigrants? Polish people are awesome!</comment>

<comment>His Contractors did 30 years ago- Rubio is now Liar #2. </comment>

<comment>Meh. It ain't like there's 10 million illegal immigrants from Eastern Europe in the US.</comment>

<comment>It is sort of a weaksauce attack, but it's probably that Rubio is just throwing whatever he can at Trump in desperation to try to make something stick. None of it will though - the people who make anti-immigration/etc one of their top priorities aren't just going to change their minds on one thing like this, not for someone else with bigger heresies of his own.</comment>

<comment>A year of free meals at Golden Corral had to be expensive.</comment>

<comment>No. That place is cheap and terrible. Never go there. Ever.</comment>

<comment>A vindictive endorses another vindictive.</comment>

<comment>A bully stumps for another bully.  The bullies' internet bullies rejoice.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the biggest bully out there as of now. In terms of bully He makes Christie look like a novice.</comment>

<comment>What year was Goldwater?</comment>

<comment>I think it was 1996.</comment>

<comment>So what happened?</comment>

<comment>They had this big election and Barry lost big to Ross Perot.</comment>

<comment>what?</comment>

<comment>Question answered. lol</comment>

<comment>answer incorrect</comment>

<comment>So....?</comment>

<comment>^^^low info</comment>

<comment>I was not paying much  attention in 1996. I am now though.</comment>

<comment>1996 was Dole vs Clinton.</comment>

<comment>I'm talking about Goldwater. I know that.</comment>

<comment>He lost.</comment>

<comment>Are you messing with her? It was 1964.</comment>

<comment>1964.  Movement conservatives in the Republican Party fought tooth and nail to have an actual right-winger, instead of an Eisenhower-esque Republican, as the nominee.  They got their wish.  Then Lyndon Johnson won in a landslide.</comment>

<comment>Funny thing is these days much of the GOP would consider Goldwater a RINO. And Reagan, too, for that matter.</comment>

<comment>"...When you say 'radical right' today, I think of these moneymaking ventures by fellows like Pat Robertson and others who are trying to take the Republican Party away from the Republican Party, and make a religious organization out of it. If that ever happens, kiss politics goodbye."Barry Goldwater, 1994</comment>

<comment>Goldwater was 1964, though admittedly that was something of a different time, where shooting off at the mouth and saying whatever you really think was far more likely to hurt you than it is today. It certainly hasn't hurt Trump much, if at all.Of course, even though Goldwater lost, he had a lasting effect on the Republican party, which is much more the party of Goldwater-64 today than it is of his rival for the nomination at the time, Rockefeller, and it laid the groundwork for Reagan to follow in his footsteps.</comment>

<comment>Ok so not 1996 then. </comment>

<comment>Who was 1996?</comment>

<comment>Clinton - Dole - Perot</comment>

<comment>1964</comment>

<comment>I'm younger than you. I was prob doing what young people do. </comment>

<comment>because he's an Obama lover too</comment>

<comment>Is that why he says he's maybe the worst president in our history and the most incompetent. Hmm</comment>

<comment>no ... he says that so stupid people will vote for him</comment>

<comment>Like Obama and Hillary  low-infos  who can't stand her but just want free stuff? </comment>

<comment>pretty much</comment>

<comment>you dumb kids are funny, stop skipping school</comment>

<comment>Fighters?  Trump inherited a ton of money.  He has declared bankruptcy four times...where is the fight?</comment>

<comment>Yawn....lies. I'm glad he inherited $$ and grew it exponentionally. Rubio is still crawling out of his debt issues.Get a new line. Trump has great ancestry and kids. </comment>

<comment>What is the lie?  He could have invested in several mutual funds and made more money than he did.  I'm not saying Rubio is better investor, but Trump is not as brilliant as people think he is.Also, how is Trump a fighter?  You say he is a fighter, but against who?</comment>

<comment>The "invest in mutual funds" line is from a person who isn't rich. Maybe she should've taken her own advice? Although anyone with any remote financial acumen will tell you mutual funds tracking the S&P index wouldn't turn 1 million into 10 billion. Do your homework outside of liberal media quotes.Trump inherited 35 million in 1999 when he was already worth more than that. I highly, highly doubt you or 99% of the populace can turn 35 million into 10 billion, or even 1 billion into 2.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the only one who values himself at $10 billion.  Now I know where you get all your info from.</comment>

<comment>Trump insanity virus is spreading.</comment>

<comment>A President who promises to put America and Americans first is popular?</comment>

<comment>I believe he's talking about a candidate like Hillary .... not much difference between her and Trump</comment>

<comment>Is Hillary proposing tariffs on companies who ship jobs overseas?</comment>

<comment>yes .... see Johnson Controls</comment>

<comment>She supported NAFTA. The worst ideA in the history of this country.</comment>

<comment>I agree</comment>

<comment>economic isolationism is economic suicide, you dumb kidsare too funny</comment>

<comment>Bilateral trade agreements are not economic isolation. Only a twit would think that.</comment>

<comment>you are trying to give someone the impression you knowwhat you are talking about and failing miserably</comment>

<comment>Trump can not make America great again. Trump is a billionaire because he has mastered crony capitalism, not free market capitalism.Trump wants his own version of big government.Trump says anything that is beneficial to his goals at the moment in time that he says it. Which means what he says will always be changing to fit his current wants and needs.Trump's next book should be titled "The Art of BS."We can not have a thin-skinned, hot headed, narcissistic, egomaniac in charge of our military, foreign policy and nuclear codes.Choose limited federal government. Stop making millionaires out of our politicians and lobbyists. Stop increasing the power of connected corporations.</comment>

<comment>I don't want limited government. I want tariffs on companies that ship jobs overseas and deportations for illegsls who undercut American wages without all of that social justice nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Take a few classes in economics, bring Trump with you.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry, we won't.  The Democratic Primary is the whole race.  We will know who are next president will be this summer.</comment>

<comment>Empty promises. Red meat for stupid flyover country. </comment>

<comment>He will, at the very least, pish off people I don't like - in both parties.</comment>

<comment>Great. Run for President and piss them off yourself. If I recall, you are the fellow the other night who said I should look for you in a brownshirt and jackboots.</comment>

<comment>You can't possibly believe that hooey.</comment>

<comment>I think that we are asking the wrong questions about this election. Trump is a horribly-flawed candidate and the GOP's refusal to put forth someone qualified has handed Democrats a once-in-a-generation opportunity to romp on the GOP not just at the presidential level but down the ballot as well.The mindset should NOT be "OMG Donald is scary, who has a better chance of beating him, Bernie or Hillary?"Rather, we should be taking a win at the presidential level by Bernie or Hillary as as a virtual given, and be asking ourselves which candidate has the best potential to mobilize voters to destroy the GOP in the down-ballot races in the Senate toss-ups but also targetable House seats with large minority populations in places like Texas and Georgia(!).I still think that Hillary is the best candidate to do this for some rather dark and pessimistic reasons. But if I thought Bernie was the one, I would switch over to Bernie in a heartbeat.</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Rubio are very qualified</comment>

<comment>Even assuming you're correct, neither is the front-runner.</comment>

<comment>at the moment</comment>

<comment>Cruz has no path to the nomination and Rubio is apparently counting on a brokered convention.</comment>

<comment>For the presidency?You mean you would like the guy who wanted to shot down the gov to be at the head of the gov?To spend 20% more on the military to fight a few thousand shepherds in Irak?</comment>

<comment>hahahahaha, you are one of those poorly educated trump is talking about</comment>

<comment>Not so much Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Bernie has much bigger coat tails than Hillary.  Agreed both win, but Bernie has a strong appeal to independent voters that Hillary doesn't.  Trump as the nominee makes the Obama demographic advantage go haywire, with Hispanic and Asian democratic voting probably north of 80%, so no danger he wins, but if Bernie is the candidate, there are many on the left who will vote D down ballot who might stay home  in disgust if Hil is the nominee.</comment>

<comment>I'm not so sure that Bernie has the longer coat-tails.One of the areas where I have a great deal of criticism for Bernie supporters is the notion that if their man doesn't win they will take their ball and go home. You don't hear that from Hillary supporters.But yeah, if I thought Bernie had the longer coat-tails I would switch my support to him.</comment>

<comment>Gee ... what a shocker .... The democrat Trump is endorsed by Obama loving Christie.</comment>

<comment>You're so butthurt. It's hilarious.</comment>

<comment>I'm not the one who got slapped around by Rubio last night</comment>

<comment>Correct. That was Andy Dick, after the debate.</comment>

<comment>Rubio's never slapped anything in his life.</comment>

<comment>There's a term for that: Santorum!</comment>

<comment>Trump is further Right on the right issues - more than the Paul Ryan & co and Rubio people.</comment>

<comment>^^^sucker</comment>

<comment>He is on the issues that matter to me and America. Paul Ryan and Rubio do not.</comment>

<comment>He's wiling to raise taxes on the wealthy, has praised Planned Parenthood, said gay marriage is "the law of the land", is willing to let deported illegal immigrants return to gain citizenship, is "neutral" on Israel, and wants to keep aspects of Obamacare.  How is he on the right?</comment>

<comment>Well, he's not in the wrong there.</comment>

<comment>Sure, many of his positions are quite moderate.  But I don't see how that makes him a consistent conservative.</comment>

<comment>Nope you lied on all of that! Fail.</comment>

<comment>He's wiling to raise taxes on the wealthy:"I would let people who are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year pay some tax," Trump said during an interview with Bloomberg News on Wednesday. "Because right now, they're paying very little tax. I think it's outrageous."has praised Planned Parenthood:CRUZ: You said, “Planned Parenthood does wonderful things and we should not defund it.”TRUMP: It does do wonderful things but not as it relates to abortion.CRUZ: So I’ll tell you what…TRUMP: Excuse me. Excuse me, there are wonderful things having to do with women’s health.said gay marriage is "the law of the land":Republican front-runner Donald Trump said Friday that he wished a Kentucky county clerk, Kim Davis, was not jailed for refusing to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, but he added that the Supreme Court has ruled and it is "the law of the land.""You have to go with it. The decision's been made, and that is the law of the land," the real estate mogul said Friday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe."is willing to let deported illegal immigrants return to gain citizenship:"It's gonna be a great wall," Trump said on the Sunday program. "This will be a wall with a big, very beautiful door because we want the legals to come back into the country."The "good people" are those who have worked hard and "have recommendations from people," he said on CBS.is "neutral" on Israel:Trump at an MSNBC town hall last week said, pressed on his positions on the conflict, “Let me sort of be a neutral guy, I don’t want to say whose fault is it, I don’t think it helps.”and wants to keep aspects of ObamacareThe most unpopular part of Obamacare now has a champion in the Republican presidential field. Via the Right Scoop, Donald Trump was asked on Thursday night by CNN's Anderson Cooper, "If…there's no mandate for everybody to have insurance, what's to—why would an insurance company not have a preexisting—insure somebody with a preexisting condition?" Trump replied, "Well, I like the mandate. Okay, so here's where I'm a little bit different. I don't want people dying on the streets. And I say this all the time."===So what part of what I wrote is a lie, Sarah?</comment>

<comment>All the stuff Cruz lied about. I'm ok with everything Trump believes not how Cruz spins it. I'm a moderate and  am ok with the irresponsible abortions that come from prospective bad parents. The alternative is worse. My church performs SSM. I'm neutral on many of these social issues.</comment>

<comment>So when you said, and I quote:that was, in fact, a lie?</comment>

<comment>Nope sorry TROLL. I'm working go lie elsewhere. </comment>

<comment>So you won't admit, after I gave you all the sources, that you calling me a liar was, in fact, a lie?  Wouldn't that be a sin, Sarah?In any case, it's clear you're not interested in seriously defending your views.</comment>

<comment>That's his appeal! He's a non ideological President who will do what's best for America.</comment>

<comment>He'll do what's best for Trump. He will be bored with the job after his first briefing on infrastructure policy.</comment>

<comment>Nationalism isn't an ideology?</comment>

<comment>No, its not.</comment>

<comment>He's so left that he's right?</comment>

<comment>Thats why Trump will win. Plus no War with Russia or zionist proxy wars like Iraq. Anti trade agreements. Trump flanks Hillary on the Left and Right. It'll be close but he'll win. A majority of Americans support all his positions. Donald J. Trump will be our next POTUS. A Left Conservative.</comment>

<comment>Trump has no politics.</comment>

<comment>What a fat, fecking, idiot.</comment>

<comment>Hillary?</comment>

<comment>I'm sensing an Atwater moment coming..</comment>

<comment>Now that he's on record as having nice things to say about Planned Parenthood, I guess it's official: Trump is moving to the center, preparing for the general election.</comment>

<comment>from the left?</comment>

<comment>Find me a further right candidate than Trump</comment>

<comment>Pay attention.</comment>

<comment>(((Planned Parenthood)))</comment>

<comment>That's exactly what he's doing.  That is what that Bush bashing was all about.  Of course bashing the last Repub prez doesn't help you in the Repub primary, but conservative independents and moderate Democrats hated Bush and the Iraq war.  Trump is running against Hillary now.</comment>

<comment>If Christie runs as his VP, it would be the most unlikable ticket imaginable.</comment>

<comment>A "get rich quick" scammer might appeal to the NE lefties ... but not the rest of the country</comment>

<comment>besides NH, there have been no other caucuses in that region. and there is nothing about trump that any "lefty" likes.your cognitive dissonance is truly starting to hamper your ability to troll effectively.</comment>

<comment>then why is Trump claiming he getting so many cross over votes?</comment>

<comment>he makes a lot of claims, do you really believe any of them? b/c i don't since pretty much all of them are huge exaggerations or just firebrand speak to rally the un-educated voters that primarily make up the GOP voting block.</comment>

<comment>I don't believe any of them .... Trump lies so much</comment>

<comment>if you think trump lies, did you seen the rest of them on that stage last night? your boys cruz and rubio aren't much better.</comment>

<comment>they're leaps and bounds better</comment>

<comment>tell me: what do you think about 2000 years of christianity telling you that you will have a second life in salvation with no proof of such but in the last 150 years science has double the human life span?</comment>

<comment>Oh,  a "tolerant" anti-religious bigot.   Charming.What are you doing today to reduce your carbon footprint for Mother Gaia?</comment>

<comment>hey, i tolerate religious idiots, but that doesn't mean i can't call out bs when i see it... and in religion, bs is everywhere.</comment>

<comment>Yet somehow the atheists managed to kill more people than all the religions combined.</comment>

<comment>that is not factually true either.</comment>

<comment>Actually it is true.   Atheist Communists and Nazi's murdered over a hundred million people in the 20th century.</comment>

<comment>and survey says...... X!</comment>

<comment>so close Restore...The nazis were a strange hodgepodge of dogmatic christianity and germanic paganism</comment>

<comment>there is some truth there bub.  Stalin, Mao, Ho Chi Mihn, Pol Pot, the Un dynasty in N Korea.  All atheist.</comment>

<comment>christianity is the largest killer out of all the belief systems.</comment>

<comment>"Science!" is the largest killer.</comment>

<comment>wait, but just before you said atheism, which is it? ah, the stupidity of the believers never ends.</comment>

<comment>The largest killer is the people who misunderstand "Science!" and believe it proves there is no god therefore they can make up the rules as they wish.</comment>

<comment>that statement makes absolutely no sense. if you believe that, why do you have a computer to type such ignorant dribble?</comment>

<comment>I believe that Christian principles of peace and tolerance and forgiveness are what allowed humans to develop science to the point that I can do this.  I am grateful to both.</comment>

<comment>and yet christianity through out its entire history has not once ever exhibited those values.you're a fool</comment>

<comment>That is true of humans in general.  Christianity actually has a better record than most.  I think that you are angry at God for some reason.  That's ok, He loves you.</comment>

<comment>im not angry at god, as it doesn't exist. i'm not angry at the ignorant masses either, but what i am tired of is the bs that religion has wrought on the human race for thousands of years. it's time for humanity to grow the F up!</comment>

<comment>I'm tired of the violence and suffering wrought by atheists who misinterpret Darwin and other scientists.</comment>

<comment>welp, you're an idiot b/c that never has ever happened</comment>

<comment>take it easy truths.  Many believers are on the side of Good and Reason.See: Jimmy Carter, Pope Francis</comment>

<comment>Were Mao, Lenin, Pol Pot, Hitler, et al all Christians?</comment>

<comment>mao came from toaist tradition originally, lenin was orthodox christian, hitler was a catholic and there are historical pictures of catholic priests visiting hitler and praising him for his actions. pol pot was actually a buddhist. aka none were atheists... that's a fallacy perpetrated by religious idiots who can't accept historical fact</comment>

<comment>They were all darwinian atheists.  Yes they got some churches to support them, but most didn't.</comment>

<comment>wrong again! boy, you really need to read a book</comment>

<comment>no, no, no.  You can't call Soviet Communism Christian just because Lenin's mother took him to church when he was a kid.  Totally intellectualy dishonest and you know it.  Regardless, Stalin was the butcher, and he was definitely atheist.</comment>

<comment>They were all maniacs who thought they were bigger than God.</comment>

<comment>yeah funny isnt it</comment>

<comment>Hitler was hardly religious. Nazism was developing its own religion, with Hitler as Messiah and Jesus a non-Jew.</comment>

<comment>Hitler was a Catholic. Not widely known, but he was. He actually had ties to the Catholic church and the Church help many Nazis escape to South America after the war. Im not making that up. just google "rat lines, catholic church"</comment>

<comment>Absolutely correct. Pius XII had been the Papal Nuncio to the Third Reich.</comment>

<comment>Mass killings occurred under some Communist regimes during the twentieth century. Estimates of the death toll vary widely, depending on the methodology used....In his summary of the estimates in the Black Book of Communism, Martin Malia suggested a death toll of between 85 and 100 million people..... the highest death tolls that have been documented in communist states occurred in the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin, in the People's Republic of China under Mao Zedong, and in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge. The estimates of the number of non-combatants killed by these three regimes alone range from a low of 21 million to a high of 70 million https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>you're not really what anyone would call a good reference of source material are you?</comment>

<comment>You are a narrow-minded bigot.</comment>

<comment>sorry but religion creates that. i can cite numerous examples of such that are recent, as in within the past year, which would highlight the bigotry exhibited by the religious</comment>

<comment>his un-favorability rating maybe</comment>

<comment>Its pretty spot on.  A LARGE bloc of Americans wouldn't vote for Trump for love or money.  Remember brown people get to vote too, and I think the 65% Romney got is pretty much a ceiling for white people.</comment>

<comment>If you can swallow a Hillary nomination, you can swallow that.</comment>

<comment>Just swallow like you usually do.</comment>

<comment>Yuge</comment>

<comment>A match made in heaven.</comment>

<comment>Christie was in the "establishment lane", but did anyone seriously think he would endorse Rubio? It's pretty obvious he has no respect for him. We know Jeb! isn't going to endorse Trump, but I bet he won't endorse Rubio either, at least not while he's trailing in the polls. The only way Jeb! endorses Rubio is if he wins enough delegates to win the nomination, at which point the endorsement is worthless. After next Tuesday, assuming Trump wins big, I bet you'll see a lot of endorsements roll in. Not because anyone wants Trump as President, but because they want jobs in his administration if he does win.</comment>

<comment>I always figured he's end up endorsing establishment Trump</comment>

<comment>Was there a big meeting before the debate last night in which the key media decided on the themes for post-debate coverage?  Trump's great loss was a very good performance despite the wishcasting.  Not that I'd want to give any of those idiots (Kasich maybe excluded) the keys to the White House.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Jon Stewart is going to resist this....He may be already negotiating for a new comedy slot....</comment>

<comment>Shit, if Trump became president, his first legislative proposal would be a Bill of Attainder against Bill Maher. Some of his top lawyers, brilliant lawyers really, say that it's perfectly constitutional.</comment>

<comment>Trump is facing some very serious fraud charges</comment>

<comment>If you are a Republican conservative, the endorsement of Christie means zero.His endorsement of Romney was a knife in the back,First was Christie's keynote speech at the 2012 GOP convention where he spent the entire time talking about himself and only mentioned Romney's name at the very end.And then there was the hug with Obama on election eve which was not necessary and if Christie thought about anyone but himself he would have known how inopportune the timing was.Clearly Trump had to have offered Christie something such as a promise to be Attorney General or maybe Director of Childhood Nutrition.I cannot think of another more useless endorsement than Christie's. He would not even have influence in New Jersey.</comment>

<comment>He does not have influence in New Jersey.  And Trump is at 31% in NJ.  You are correct, Christie's endorsement will have no noticeable effect.</comment>

<comment>Really?Just watch the super Tuesday results.....</comment>

<comment>Trump will let Ted Cruz suck up to the 10% of the party that's so obsessed with being Pure Conservatives. Christie is a big (in more than one) get.</comment>

<comment>You know what sucks about being a conservative? The line keeps moving. If you were a conservative 20 years ago, the people to the right are telling you you are no longer conservative enough. So you have to swing farther right to remain a "true" conservative. I think people are getting sick of trying to play that game. Now they want jobs, they want to be in control, they want someone who speaks to their issues. They are sick of the party telling them what issues are important and what they should be speaking about.</comment>

<comment>Really??? .... Really??? ....Trump University was just another scam? ... say it ain't so</comment>

<comment>This stunt has served its transient purpose, taking Rubio and Cruz out of the headlines.</comment>

<comment>One of these Trump rallies is going to get violent, for real. I can't wait.</comment>

<comment>What's your plan?</comment>

<comment>Midget-tossing Bushes' wife into the crowd?</comment>

<comment>Wee Man would like that.</comment>

<comment>Brown Shirt and Jackboots.</comment>

<comment>The Black Shirts were cool too. </comment>

<comment>You're not the only one.</comment>

<comment>get the popcorn!</comment>

<comment>Is going to? Already happened.</comment>

<comment>Agree. Someone is going to get killed on national TV.</comment>

<comment>May the next mass shooting be at a trump rally.</comment>

<comment>It looks more and more likely that Trump will win the nomination.  As with the other Republicans, he is several orders of magnitude superior to Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders.Trumps stated positions include being pro-life, pro-2nd Amendment, anti-government bureaucracy,  pro strong military, pro protecting our border, etc,  He has promised to replace Obama Care and get rid of the Iran agreement.    Further his is the only candidate with a rational position on China's trade war against the U.S.  He may not be a movement conservative, but certainly positionally he at least a pretty conservative Republican.   So time to cool down the rhetoric and focus on the real enemy to our country - whoever wins the Democrat nomination.</comment>

<comment>I'm really hoping Bernie wins the nomination, if for no other reason than the attack ads.</comment>

<comment>"Hi I'm Kim Jong Un with a message for America. Support my Communist Brother, Bernie Sanders!"</comment>

<comment>The Bernster desperately needs Trump's hair stylist and Hillary's plastic surgeon.</comment>

<comment>Maybe Jimmy Fallon and Justin Timberlake could take him out shopping for a sharp suit.</comment>

<comment>Include Bieber and its a date!</comment>

<comment>Bieber can choose the tats and nose-ring while the other two pick out the suit.</comment>

<comment>There's plenty of great imagery from the Soviet Union. Hammer & Sickles. Marx/Engels quotes. It'll be yuge.</comment>

<comment>In fairness, it's not that much more embarrassing than a Ted Nugent endorsement. Pederasts for Trump, 2016.</comment>

<comment>I think the Democrats have the pederasty vote locked up already, wouldn't you agree?</comment>

<comment>I can just hear Trump's next primary victory speech: "we won with the old, we won with the young, we won with the well-educated, we won with the poorly-educated, we won with pederasts, I loooove the pederasts." Seriously though, I bet the pederast vote breaks down in a bunch of different ways. I'll explain if I get a chance (I'm late for a man-boy love society meeting). Have a nice weekend.</comment>

<comment>Trump has no plan.  He's just shouting empty promises.  What is he going to replace Obama Care with?  He had no answer last night because he has no solutions.</comment>

<comment>Since when is a true free market in health insurance "no plan?" That's the point of the selling across state lines proposal that Rubio was so baffled by.</comment>

<comment>"Hey Donald! Draw a circle around THIS!!"</comment>

<comment>the free market is what got us into this healthcare messtoo much greed</comment>

<comment>The healthcare market has not been anything like a free market since the advent of large health insurance providers. It's why medical technologies never get any cheaper, despite being decades old. Plus, there is no federal law, and certainly not under the ACA, which says that insurers in one state can't sell to patients in a different state. What Trump's proposal ultimately means is using the Supremacy Clause and a new federal law to curtail or even re-write existing state laws regulating the kinds of insurance that may be sold within their borders.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I think that Donald could get a better deal than spending one billion dollars on a website that didn't even work.</comment>

<comment>Valerie Jarrett's daughter and son-in-law had big executive jobs with the website developer.</comment>

<comment>When you elect a community organizer with no business experience, you generally don't get efficient results for your buck.Oh well, OPM ( Other people's Money).</comment>

<comment>god, you dumb fox news kids are funny</comment>

<comment>nobody on that stage has a replacement for obamacarethat complaint amounts to zero</comment>

<comment>Trump is pro TRUMP. The rest is expedience.</comment>

<comment>If he were only pro TRUMP, he'd be on some island somewhere enjoying the sun.</comment>

<comment>His EGO is basking. The rest is detail.</comment>

<comment>the fact that you believe anything trump says just shows your ignorance</comment>

<comment>Oh this is getting good now.Listening to Rubio, I still see a short kid running for high school student body president.I know he's the one the money men are putting up there now, but they could have picked someone a bit less callow.</comment>

<comment>They tried. . . but the electorate wasn't having any of it. Perry, Walker, Bush. . . Rubio's basically their last stand.</comment>

<comment>One bully endorsing another, nothing to write home about this. </comment>

<comment>Loud talk is nothing compared to the use of policies foreign and domestic which have devastated this country's citizens--look who promotes and perpetuates global corporatism/big government.</comment>

<comment>The more I think about (yes I actually think), the next endorsement is Guiliani. Probably just when Trump needs another boost in the media cycle.</comment>

<comment>The cross dressing adulterer won't help Trump.</comment>

<comment>When Trump is President, he's going to come after his online critics. Good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>Okay?</comment>

<comment>Christie decided he wants to be VP, eh?</comment>

<comment>Naw, he wants one of those Chinese donuts that are topped with fatty meat.</comment>

<comment>I'm certain of it. I think things have moved very quickly in the last week. Im pretty sure there is a detente between Rubio and Cruz. My guess is that they agreed that whoever loses to the other will be the VP candidate. Trump obviously has picked his.</comment>

<comment>Trump truly is a talent. Less than 12 hours after Rubio was widely thought to get the better of him, the story of the day is now about the man who crushed Rubio endorsing Trump.</comment>

<comment>And it's all instinct! Imagine what he could do as President...</comment>

<comment>I shudder.</comment>

<comment>This is beautiful to watch.  After the most minor of stumbles in the debate yesterday, the entire media jumped on it to try to take Trump down.  And here he just went and changed the whole news cycle again.  Say what you want about his politics, etc., but he plays you guys like a fiddle every single time.</comment>

<comment>It has changed. Instead of CNN being Trump all day, today Trump is taking second fiddle to Rubio, who is attacking him relentlessly.</comment>

<comment>interesting, isn't it, how Cruz crows that he'll let people "die on the street' and the media exclaims, "Ha! He showed Trump!"</comment>

<comment>Brilliant, fri afternoon news cycle.</comment>

<comment>Yep. Genius move.</comment>

<comment>Didn't Trump say a TEMPORARY ban on Muslims entering the US until a proper vetting process is installed? The media always leaves that out..gee, wonder why!</comment>

<comment>Didn't you hear? The New Yorker who is friends with tons of minority celebrities and whose daughter is a married to a Jew is actually the AMERICAN HITLER!!!</comment>

<comment>I thought that was Ronald Reagan..uhhh...I mean George Bush? Hitler has an heir now?</comment>

<comment>no, no, no, Trump is Mussolini, not Hitler.</comment>

<comment>Here's the vetting process question :"What kind of execution method do you support for infidel cartoonists who slander the Holy Prophet?"</comment>

<comment>Now see I have no problem with that.</comment>

<comment>Temporary or permanent, it's inimical to American values, or at least those of crazy kooks like James Madison and Thomas Jefferson.</comment>

<comment>SHAME Chris Christie</comment>

<comment>You assume he can feel shame.</comment>

<comment>He went beyond shame when he cuckolded Gay Barry on the beach.</comment>

<comment>Are you a closeted gay adult, or a 15 year old boy? It's one or the other. If you're 15, don't worry, the gals will start to notice you soon.</comment>

<comment>I really don't see how Trump's performance was particularly bad. He held his own pretty well, dominated in talk time, and let's be honest, how are any of these attacks going to push his voters away from him? Not a lot of people watched this debate and the whole thing was a total mess. Trump has been attacked with all of Rubio's points from the beginning and it has done nothing to stop Trump.And, let's be real honest here. Not a single Republican Nominee didn't win one of the first four primaries. This race is over.</comment>

<comment>Trump looked like an unhinged kook last night</comment>

<comment>He always does.  Do you remember the first two debates?  Yet he only got stronger after them.</comment>

<comment>He hasn't had a single good debate. Hasn't mattered.</comment>

<comment>Cruz looks like that daily.</comment>

<comment>Ok, he's always looked that way. What's different now? How is it this time that he's going to lose from it?</comment>

<comment>I'm gonna wait to see how Ben Carson does on Super Tuesday before I call anything.</comment>

<comment>Ben Carson will probably get 4-5% of the votes. He'll likely be taking them from Cruz or Trump pretty evenly, so he won't be much of an effect.</comment>

<comment>I like it.  I think this country needs an end to the PC.  The PC is killing us.</comment>

<comment>I think we need to repeal the First Amendment so the Second Amendment becomes #1.</comment>

<comment>You are a window into the conscience of a Trumpkin.</comment>

<comment>Libs would love to control free speech.What they would approve of would be such things as "I feel totally victimized by the white man, gimme some free money, free schooling, and a bunch of expensive things for free."Also, when Muslims commit honor killings, mass murder and atrocities, libs would declare Muslims should be free to use such speech as:  "I feel victimized by the white man, and therefore I need to kill and commit piracy - take land, take lives, go anywhere I like, and take any damned thing I want."</comment>

<comment>Do you ever read your posts AFTER the peyote has worn off?</comment>

<comment>I guess I'm not very politically correct, huh?</comment>

<comment>Anchor baby is a fluent idiot.</comment>

<comment>Muz, I wasn't born here.  Don't you have to go pray on some dog rug or something?</comment>

<comment>Oh, you swam over and are an illegal. By bad!</comment>

<comment>What about any of our exchanges has ever given you the impression that I care about political correctness? The problem with your comments is not that they are un-Pc. It's that they are poorly reasoned, tend to indulge giant straw men (as in the post above), and, in many cases, reflect an outsized fear of Islam and genuine malice toward Muslims, born of abject ignorance and a stunningly narrow worldview. Political correctness is your obsession, not mine.</comment>

<comment>I have found that logical fallacies are used by everyone, and that the "straw man" conveniently seems to be whatever argument THE OPPOSITION is making.I don't have an outsized fear of Islam.  Every country is suffering because of Islam's violence.  Islam has never NOT been violent.  I find it shocking that you are so willing to overlook the violence inherent in Islam, and (because I'm female) I find it disgusting that you don't care a rat's behind that Islam is the most misogynist cult, group, organization, politics, in the world.  The atrocities committed upon women from the beginning of this religion to the present, are so shocking, so as to take one's breath away, but you seem to be just fine and dandy because you met a Muslim somewhere and he had arms and legs and he wasn't hacking a female to death.Well, I'm sure that a lot of Nazis never hacked anyone to death, but that did not mean they did not share the same belief as those who did hack people to death and gas them and torture them and perform horrific things on them.Same applies to Islam.  Those who aren't out there hacking anyone to death still believe in their religion/culture/faith/people, and the "movement" of violence that gives it the current role as perpetrator of violence upon the entire earth today.I find you shocking, that you're so cool with it.</comment>

<comment>You are correct that the term straw man is overused on these boards. A straw man argument is a mischaracterization of your opponent's position or argument as one that appears facile or to contain offensive views, such that it may be easily refuted or knocked over (like a straw man). If you'd like an example, read your prior post, since it does not reflect any of my views (for example "you seem to be just fine and dandy because you met a Muslim somewhere and he had arms and legs and he wasn't hacking a female to death."). Religion doesn't kill people; people kill people, and only a person who is totally ignorant about world history thinks that Islam is unique in inspiring fanaticism and violence or that the sorts of violence it inspires is unique in itself. History teaches me that the world has often (typically) been a nasty place, that sectarian violence has been quite common, and that violence against women and deeply offensive patriarchal attitudes have prevailed in virtually every culture in human history. Thankfully, we live in a place (and more importantly a very recent time) when the patriarchal attitudes indulged to oppress women have been torn down to a significant degree, based on our own movement away from traditional, often religiously-inspired, ideas about a woman's place in society.</comment>

<comment>Something which I'm sure you do as well, but that you only point out in others.Religion is an ideology.  No two religions are the same.  Buddhism is the antithesis of Islam, for example.  Christians are not flying planes into buildings, and have not spent 1400 years dehumanizing, torturing, maiming, and murdering females, whether they are family members or not.  Islam has.The entirety of the Middle East was converted from pagan and Christian to Islam via Islamic savagery.All of that comes from instructions in the Koran.No, all religions are not the same, and all Abrahamic religions are not the same.  That's a lie that's become quite popular recently among liberals, and which they enjoy repeating.Please stop repeating the same BS to me.  I've heard it already, and it's pure lies.  Your repeating it again is not going to make it truth.</comment>

<comment>Dude, after reading your response I could not stop laughing for a long time :-p</comment>

<comment>Hilarious :-)</comment>

<comment>when you say you "think", you only flaltter yourself</comment>

<comment>Anchor baby speaks</comment>

<comment>Gacy? DIdn't they execute you or something?</comment>

<comment>Quit being so PC. Just pointing out the anchor baby.</comment>

<comment>Ah, the Muzlime is in the house.</comment>

<comment>Anchor baby is whining</comment>

<comment>That's why I have a Mac. But Apple better cooperate with the encryption or I am tossing it.</comment>

<comment>lol  Stop!</comment>

<comment>Orange supremacists are now endorsing a Trump.</comment>

<comment>That's actually decent. Did you come up with that by yourself?</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure Trump needed to be "rescued". Seems to be doing fine.</comment>

<comment>Trump thought he needed a fat white knight to rescue him.</comment>

<comment>I gave you an up-vote, because I love your avatar and username... can't we all just get a bong?</comment>

<comment>I got the papers if you got the weed.</comment>

<comment>Keep watching. Read what Barbara Res had to say about the great man. </comment>

<comment>Rubio got torn apart today.It was nice.</comment>

<comment>Sir, Senator Rubio has resorted to unsavory behavior,  mocking you and questioning your continence.   Maintain the high ground.</comment>

<comment>I'll let Christie be attack dog.</comment>

<comment>More like attack hog?</comment>

<comment>After next Tuesday Rubio will matter even less than he does today.</comment>

<comment>Anything that helps Trump at this point is close to treason. Doesn't Christie care about America?</comment>

<comment>How the hell do you figure Christie is capable of riding to anybody's rescue? Just not an imagine I want to envision. The rescue better not be on horseback or ice. Losers</comment>

<comment>He rode in on a Hover-Round.</comment>

<comment>Can Trump win in Texas? If he can, he will be hard to beat. If not, and Cruz takes it, its a whole new race.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is ahead in Texas but the delegates there are allotted proportionately.</comment>

<comment>Im aware they are, but there are so many, if Cruz crushes it, or even does really well and Trump and Rubio have to split the rest, Cruz will be right back in the hunt.</comment>

<comment>Only kinda sorta.</comment>

<comment>Dammit!  I've had enough of Texan presidents.  LBJ sucked.  GW Bush sucked.  Cruz would really suck.  NO MAS!!</comment>
