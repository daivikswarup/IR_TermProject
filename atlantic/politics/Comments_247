<comment>Americans want (and need) a President who cares more about American citizens and less about Wall Street and their global elite friends!Donald Trump for President - 2016!</comment>

<comment>So you're feeling the Bern?</comment>

<comment>Sanders represents populist nationalism; Trump represents populist nationalism.  There's a major realignment happening.There's probably a lot more overlap between the two than the globalist establishment (Dem and Repub) are able to admit.</comment>

<comment>Sanders represents populist socialism.</comment>

<comment>National Socialism.</comment>

<comment>I'm not positive, but I'm pretty sure that presidential candidate Bernie Sanders isn't a nazi. Hold on, let me check. Nope. Not a nazi. I'm not even sure it'd be accurate to call him a nationalist.</comment>

<comment>Those damn Commie Jewish Nazis are the worst!</comment>

<comment>Except, despite what Fox News says, Sanders is proposing realistic plans. Some of them are bad plans, but they're realistic. Trump is proposing completely unrealistic plans that no one with any power supports. Trump picked up two endorsements from Reps; one said he doesn't support Trump's Muslims ban and plan to deport all illegal aliens and the other (Duncan Hunter) won't return my email asking if he supports those plans. If he did, no doubt I'd get a form emailing saying he's a full-on Trumpist.Trump voters who are concerned about mass immigration, trade, etc. deserve to be represented. They're their own worst enemies by falling for a charlatan like Trump who has no way to follow through on his promises. It's also not in the U.S.'s best interests to have President Wise Guy giving shout outs to other casino magnates at state functions.In case anyone wants to do something, urge anti-Trump leaders to use http://stumptrump.us/ Everything they've tried so far has only helped Trump, it's time to do things the smart way.</comment>

<comment>This is what's happening.  The previous paradigm that Bush/Cheney oversaw coupled with the unyielding ideology that has become entrenched in not just mainstream politics but the fabric of our society is being rejected.  The 'establishment' has yet to even begin the mastication process much less begun to  digest.</comment>

<comment>Sanders has no mathematical way to beat Hillary and the super delegates have it rigged in any case.   On the GOP side, Trump is mathematically assured of the nomination.  He is competitive with Cruz in Texas, meaning Cruz will not get 50% of the vote and thus will not get 100% of the delegates there.   In Florida, Rubio is far behind.   The race is over.  You are not being told this because the networks like ratings.  Thus your choice in November will be Trump or Hillary.</comment>

<comment>>Sanders has no mathematical way to beat Hillary and the super delegates have it rigged in any case.That is some strange math you are doing. Superdelegates only count for less than 15% of all delegates in the democratic nomination process. Even assuming 100% of all superdelegates went to Hillary (a very unlikely scenario in a race where Bernie won more conventional delegates), Bernie Sanders still has plenty of available delegates necessary to win in the coming state primaries. He certainly has an uphill battle, as has been the case since day one of his campaign, but to say it's "mathematically impossible" is outright false.</comment>

<comment>Bernie isn't competitive in the major states.  You are dillusional </comment>

<comment>What makes a candidate "competitive"?</comment>

<comment>And even if it's 50/50 you conceded 15%  that's enormous and insurmountable </comment>

<comment>Love it - so many ppl fail to realize the crossover that both Trump & Bernie share.</comment>

<comment>Yes! Billionaires don't care about Wall Street and the global elite. They care about you! </comment>

<comment>Trump, for all his money, is a patriotic American.  He's a good fit for American nationalism.Our elites used to care about the nation, and not just as a place to strip-mine.  It can happen again.</comment>

<comment>Assumes facts not in evidence. </comment>

<comment>Billionaires who quite literally have their names on Wall Street properties - look up 40 Wall Street.It's like a mad god of chaos has descended upon the electorate, and left everyone talking gibberish and dancing the St. Vitus shuffle.</comment>

<comment>Donald is just like us* !*Statement excludes his economic status, inheritance, wife made from imported plastic, social circle, number of bankruptcies, army of lawyers, fame, reality show experience, lack of normal human emotions, "hair", unnatural coloring...</comment>

<comment>http://thearchdruidreport.blog...</comment>

<comment>He also differs in his ability to effect change on our behalf.</comment>

<comment>Yup, he'll do far  more damage to the country than most of *us* could.</comment>

<comment>Not to worry, no one will ever rival OBummer in the damage department.</comment>

<comment>If you really think that this man - who struts about like he's trying to summon Mussolini's ghost - wouldn't do immeasurable harm, you probably deserve this racist, misogynist charlatan.</comment>

<comment>He reaffirmation of the First Amendment alone is sufficient to get my vote. And if you think US laws cannot be changed to encourage manufacturers to stay in the US, and bring some businesses home, you need to do some more research. I'm sick of these idiots who purchase their votes and self-righteousness with eye watering trillions in debt and taxes. How about a businessman who will focus on creating more businesses and jobs instead of leading the race to the bottom for personal glorification?</comment>

<comment>I like the way you think and your screen name is perfection.</comment>

<comment>You sir, are a gentleman and a scholar.</comment>

<comment>What reaffirmation of the First Amendment?  I don't like political correctness, but given the choice is between political correctness and unvarnished racism, I'll choose political correctness.And I do believe there are real, positive steps that could be taken to improve America's competitiveness.  Trump hasn't shown me any evidence that he understands what those steps would be, much less that he'd be able to accomplish them.</comment>

<comment>What is so hard about what Trump is saying.  The Mexican side of the border is bought and paid for by drug cartels and human traffickers.  Why should we honor any agreements with such a corrupt government or be shy about renegotiating or demanding they pay for their inadequacies.  The muslim religious fanatics and the Islamic world in general are presenting the world with a level of violent terror that is the most horrific element on offer in the modern world.  Why should we not request and require that they clean their house up before we show them favor?  Neither of these things are racist.  That is a red herring used by reactionary, weepy children who know nothing of the real world.</comment>

<comment>Wow - it seems you see Mexico as nothing more than a bunch of drugrunners and Muslims as nothing more than terrorists, and propose our dealings with them treat them accordingly. Then you insist you're not really racist.</comment>

<comment>No, I think your assumption that hard-working Mexicans are content and satisfied that  Mexican people are being murdered by drug cartels at a rate that would make Hitler blush is suspect.  I think your assumption that Muslims are content and satisfied that people are committing murder in the name of their religion is suspect.  You might want to ask yourself who you are defending.  Are you content and satisfied that Mexican drug cartels are murdering people in the streets?  Are you content and satisfied that muslim religious fanatics are blowing themselves up and wreaking havoc in the world in the name of Islam?  How about putting out a fatwa for the murder of Salman Rushdie?  I assume it would be racist to call that a bad thing ... huh?  Where do you stand on that?  You're just a part of the pc police crowd without a clue about the real world.  Stick your thumb back in your mouth and pull your blanket back up around your chin.</comment>

<comment>You're not even close on any of my assumptions, but thanks for playing!Again, the VAST MAJORITY of the world's Muslims are not terrorists or extremists.  The VAST MAJORITY of Mexicans are not drug runners.  (The Hitler comparison, by the way, is both laughable and revealing.)I'm defending whomever is deserving of being defended.  Religious extremists are contemptible and should be wiped out like scum they are.  But that doesn't justify treating the vast majority of peacable Muslims like they're all terrorists - in fact doing so probably hurts the cause of moderate Muslims.  Ditto Mexican drug dealers - they're subhuman, but most Mexicans are victims of these gangs.Taking the worst elements of a foreign culture and painting the entirety of that culture with that brush is textbook racism. If not being racist qualifies as 'pc' in your book, I'll happily accept the label.</comment>

<comment>No. You're purposefully misrepresenting what I wrote.  In a word you're a liar.  I am saying just the opposite of what you are trying to twist my words into saying.  It is the VAST MAJORITY of latinos and muslims who are horrified and deserve defending by the misdeeds done by a vanishingly small number of their own people (for whom there is no defense - it does not exclude them from being what they are whether muslim or Mexican) whether for purposes of greed or fanatical religious beliefs.  Your belief that you are "defending whomever is deserving of being defended" is solipsistic and delusional.Again, because you are so confident in your position I would like you to contextualize the horrific violence done by drug cartels in Mexico and the murder done by muslim religious fanatics and fatwa's on writers.  If you can defend all of that you are capable of olympian feats of pretzel logic.  You're just a self-righteous little pc thug.</comment>

<comment>Ahhh, you're really hurting my feelings now.But the fact remains that, even if though you acknowledge that terrorists / drug dealers are but a tiny proportion of these populations, you're OK formulating policy that treats them as if they're all there was.  And your candidate is OK painting with these same broad brushstrokes.  To paraphrase someone who once showed a similar level of intellectual depth as you've demonstrated:  "racist is as racist does".</comment>

<comment>What you are failing to realize or acknowledge is that in order to talk about these issues it is impossible to avoid using the labels "muslim", "latino", "hispanic", "Mexican".  When a person uses these labels it is neither an attempt to attack the entire population that label names nor is it a sly way to gather the mob together with the objective of disabusing the people the label names.  There are real issues in the world.  "White" racism was and to an extent is a problem.  I doubt you have any problem using that label.  But, I am sure you don't mean "all" white people are racist.  Black on black murder is a problem.  Should I consult you as to what words and what kind of language is ok to talk about this issue?  I still don't understand what you're defending and/or to what your objecting.  It does seem you have a broadly general and vague sense of indignation born from sophomoric political correctness.</comment>

<comment>Recent history is littered with unfavorable trade agreements.  Middle class America has been gutted.  What is so hard to understand that if the US - under a Trump presidency - makes it an objective to deal with bad actors - China - with strength rather than capitulation that middle class America (ns) would benefit.  Benefit how, you ask?  Jobs.  Henry Ford was famously asked why he paid his workers so well.  His response, "I need someone to sell my cars to."  Now you may reprimand him for ending his sentence with a preposition but you just might miss his point.</comment>

<comment>Oh Lord, the universal "racist" epithet. Check out donaldjtrump.com positions and issues, and I'd be happy to discuss any considerations you might have.</comment>

<comment>You're right, I left out sexist. Trumps own words indict him.http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/b...</comment>

<comment>Still waiting for substantive discussion.In other marie claire news:http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/n...</comment>

<comment>No. A racist, misogynist charlatan cannot possibly do the amount of damage that Obama has done to this country.I wont vote for the charlatan, but Obama and the Democrats have been actively undermining our constitution, economy, values and standing in the world.</comment>

<comment>Why is Trump a racist?  Believing that our border laws should be enforced or that our immigration laws should be enforced is not racist.  These are legal matters that have nothing to do with the color of skin.  Muslim religious fanatics have been doing atrociously inhumane acts of murder and terror all over the world.  Is it racist to want to deal with an extreme problem in an extreme manner?  You are much too simplistic in your thinking and you should maybe sit alone and rethink before you spew simple-minded garbage in public.</comment>

<comment>If you can't see the racism and sexism Trump doesn't even try to hide, you need to reset your racism filter.</comment>

<comment>No, you need to reset your race filter ... it's my ball ... no it's my ball ...</comment>

<comment>When people make arguments based on "effectiveness," they usually point to a person's record or other empirical evidence.  The Donald has done nothing to effect change on your behalf.  All he has are slogans and adoring fans who love slogans..</comment>

<comment>Well, all of the other candidates have to be very careful and owe a lot of favors. Trump is in the unique position of being able to do what he thinks is right. He is often criticized for not articulating his positions and issues, but they are published: https://www.donaldjtrump.comEven his bizarre claim of having Mexico pay for a wall appears tenable. We give Mexico around $560 million per year https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/... . This amount is indeed sufficient to build a wall. In a final twist of irony, the project will probably ultimately prove popular with hispanics who dominate the construction industry in Texas.</comment>

<comment>> Well, all of the other candidates have to be very careful and owe a lot of favors. Trump is in the unique position of being able to do what he thinks is right.So instead of being under the thumb of a billionaire, he _is_ the billionaire. Sounds good to me!</comment>

<comment>So true. A man who's ego has shifted from accumulation of wealth to making a difference for his legacy is uniquely qualified. A yuge ego is great if it is directed in your best interest. Ironically, the super-rich Republican supporters are shunning him due to his populist platform.He is also the only one remotely qualified to oversee the largest economy in the world. The amateurs have squandered about 20 trillion dollars to provide the slowest economic recovery in our history and left us with an extra 10 trillion in debt. Now little old ladies have to sacrifice with no return on their savings so we can afford it. Someone that actually understands how to run the business of the country is long overdue.</comment>

<comment>> A man who's ego has shifted from accumulation of wealth to making a difference for his legacy is uniquely qualified. A yuge ego is great if it is directed in your best interest. LOL, because he told you? The guy that wanted to kick out a "maggot" to make room for his casino?> He is also the only one remotely qualified to oversee the largest economy in the world.Yeah, who better than Mr. Bankrupt-O-Rama. How do casinos declare bankruptcy? That's like Alaska unable to produce any cold weather.  And he told us the people who lent him money were suckers, but of course you're not one, wink wink ;);)But I would rather have him than Cruz or Rubio. A grab bag is better than a crap one.</comment>

<comment>We all have a past, if my resume was based on stunts I pulled in my 20's ...Check out his website, donaldjtrump.com where his policies are written in detail.</comment>

<comment>The Secure Fence Act of 2006 cost about $2.4 billion to build an ineffective fence over about a third of the border, so it's reasonable to assume an equally ineffective fence covering the whole border would cost about $7.2 billion.</comment>

<comment>Classic example of a bad deal. They spent most of the money installing unproven super high tech technology which never worked and then had to go back with off the shelf electronics. All this to avoid the appearance of an actual wall. I'm fine with plain old razor wire supported with cameras. Its worked for years.</comment>

<comment>Donald cares about Donald.</comment>

<comment>Trump is seventy years old.  He has been a businessman in this country his entire adult life.  It's a certainty that he has accrued a vast amount of experience during that time.  Why is it impossible that he might sincerely believe what he is saying and that his motives are anything but pure.</comment>

<comment>He'll certainly be having anyone who dares criticize him killed.... so I guess he's exactly who the Republican base has been waiting for - a violent egomaniac who'll literally kill unpopular people for them.Seriously, imagine him in charge of the Oregon standoff, and one of those guys insults him too much? Trump would have had the whole area nerve gassed.</comment>

<comment>Great article!  </comment>

<comment>Not surprising that progs are already writing nonsense. </comment>

<comment>It's not really surprising that the GOP establishment is still claiming this. Repeating falsehoods in hopes of making them true is one of their favorite activities.</comment>

<comment>I really hope Trump and Sanders are out of the picture a few months from now. There are so many important topics to discuss as a nation, but those two are radicalizing their ignorant worshipers and tearing the country apart.</comment>

<comment>I disagree.  There are so many important topics to discuss as a nation, and they're surfacing those topics in a way that "mainstream" candidates never would.</comment>

<comment>Yes. Perhaps we're getting beyond the days of a candidate being elected based on promises to outlaw abortion?</comment>

<comment>It isn't Sanders tearing the country apart. It is and has been conservatives since 2010. Trump is where he is because republicans in congress  have done nothing but say no since 2010.</comment>

<comment>Obama was the start of this divide. He explicitly announced that he was here to fundamentally change America, and that is exactly what he's tried to do. It's the job of the Republicans to represent the people who elect them, and the people who elected them did not want to reshape America in Obama's image.Now Sanders and Trump have massive cult followings who live in fantasyland. It's just hate and anger and blame from both of those mobs. Democracy is a joke.</comment>

<comment>Some people like Pepsi some people like CokeThe wacky morning DJ says democracy's a joke--Cake</comment>

<comment>It seemed to them a good idea at the time.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is tearing apart the bourgeoisie.</comment>

<comment>The GOP establishment catered to the fears and prejudices of the folks who are now Trump voters for years.  They are reaping what they sowed. I have no pity for them, but I'm very worried for the country.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a mutant Frankenstein virus comprised of the Southern Strategy, Religious Right, and Tea Party strains.  The Republicans have been taking advantage of the rubes for years, decades, but now they've created a monster that they can't control.  As you note, the chickens are coming home to roost.  There's a lot of schadenfreude there, except that the US is really screwed if Trump is elected.</comment>

<comment>Because the U.S. would be so much worse off electing an independently wealthy businessman, than the corporate-owned political hacks that we usually have to chose from. Riiiight.</comment>

<comment>I don't disagree.  It's just that Trump doesn't really offer any long-term solutions to the current broken system.</comment>

<comment>There is no political Messiah who has all the answers to America's thorny problems, ranging from the national debt to ISIS. So the question then becomes: Would Trump surround himself with good advisers, and would he make wise decisions?  Being in business is all about analyzing information, making decisions and crafting strategies, so I think his experience would stand him in good stead.</comment>

<comment>Which great business puts Trump in good stead? Trump's great at self-promotion but he's a business mediocrity.Trump lost investors over a billion in his massive and record breaking bankruptcies, they were a result of Trump mis-managing and over-borrowing, just like the US govt does. Then there is Trump Steaks, the three failed Trump Magazines, the failed Trump board game, the failed Trump airline with it’s gold toilet seats, Trump Ice, GoTrump the dotcom bust, Trump Vodka - all failed. Trump Steakhouse in Las Vegas shut down after 51 health code violations, including expired yogurt and five-month old duck. Then Trump's failed football ownership and horrible judgement that resulted in killing the entire football league. Trump f'd it up.If you go by Trump's track record, he will make BIG promises and then end up delivering .... failure.</comment>

<comment>I'm guessing you're working from this list: http://time.com/3988970/donald...Why no mention of the successes, though?</comment>

<comment>This independently wealthy (thanks Daddy!!!) businessman?  Yes, they would be much worse off.</comment>

<comment>It appears Trump has greatly increased the fortune left to him by his father, who was a self-made man, the son of immigrants. That's commendable, IMO.You are, of course, entitled to your opinion.</comment>

<comment>self-made? yeah, if you include getter millions in govt grants and milking them illegally. Then getting $400 million in tax abatements from NYC.Trump's a self-made crony capitalist.</comment>

<comment>I have no problem with anyone using existing government policy to their advantage. For instance, I work only part-time, make the max contribution to my IRA to reduce my AGI, and hold my income down to the point where the government buys me health insurance. Does that mean I approve of the ACA? No; I think it's horribly flawed and largely a giveaway to the healthcare and insurance sectors. But my job, as a private individual, is to figure out how to use government policies to my advantage. (And to vote for a better government whenever possible.)</comment>

<comment>You, too are entitled to your opinion.  However it's a fact if Donald had just taken Daddy's money, invested it in an indexed fund of stocks, or in an indexed fund of Manhattan real estate, he'd be far wealthier today than he actually is.  Don't believe the hype Trump spews about himself - the man is a shameless liar and self-promoter, but a pretty lousy businessman.http://www.economist.com/news/...</comment>

<comment>Except that his "Daddy" kept the vast majority of his own money until he died in 1999, when Trump was already in his 50s and filthy rich himself. So are you suggesting that he should have found some way of bilking his father out of his money so that he could take it and invest it in the S&P 500? Trump took an early loan of $1 million and turned it into a vast fortune and an international real estate empire.</comment>

<comment>I assume you have abundant, reliable sources to back that up?  Maybe you have access to the books of Trump's notoriously opaque businesses?  Because the article I linked starts in 1985, the first year we have any information on his assets apart from Daddy's.  If you have something better by all means present it.And by the way, the estimation of Trump's sub-par performance as a businessman doesn't even take into account all the creditors' money he's lost along the way in numerous bankruptcies.  Trump may be able to bluster his way through an episode of The Apprentice, but there's no good reason to believe he could successfully manage the American economy.</comment>

<comment>So, let's get this straight.  You claim to be worried on behalf of the American people.  You then go on to say that the American people are what threatens their country.  OK.  We are in crazyland now.</comment>

<comment>In 2008, the people were misled by a lying campaign full of empty promises. Too many people fell for it.  The worst president in decades resulted.In 2016, sick of the worst President in decades and his policies, people were looking for a change.Along came a man great at self-promotion. The people were misled by a lying campaign full of empty  promises. Too many people fell for it.... the cycle repeats.</comment>

<comment>You act as though the democrats are blameless: I don't consider myself a republican and I hate defending them, but how do you watch this cycle play out and think: the democrats are absolutely blameless here? </comment>

<comment>Look at the respective debates; it's like night and day. The Republican primary is built around a bunch of myths and falsehoods . . listening to the GOP debate you'd think ISIS is executing attacks in the U.S. weekly and that Mexican immigrants are storming across the border en masse; whereas this country hasn't had any coordinated terrorist attacks outside of lone wolf losers in 15 years and immigration south of the border has largely stabilized; you now have as many Mexicans RETURNING to Mexico as coming here. Trump even mentioned Japan as a trade enemy. His hair dye must give him flashbacks to 1988, and the rest of the GOP candidates are stuck in the 80s and 90s as well. Even Rubio's quasi 1995 Christian Coalition schtick "the music and movies around today denigrating the American family" . . . .at least Sanders and Clinton are actually talking about actual public policy proposals besides the GOP's ridiculous tax plans which would crater the country into endless debt or their dreams of invading yet another Middle Eastern country.</comment>

<comment>Night and Day.Agreed.Democrats whining and blaming others for everything, and Republicans acting like adults.</comment>

<comment>"Republicans acting like adults."LOL OK. See you in November.</comment>

<comment>Sanders magic "pay for everything by taking it form the billionaires" and the black lives matter nonsense are as silly and unrealistic as some of the garbage the Republicans come up with.</comment>

<comment>Hilary for President!Glad that we all agree on this.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is a grownup but for various reasons I'd prefer Kasich.  I'd even prefer Rubio to Hillary, if he had Kasich as a babysitter.</comment>

<comment>Kasich does seem like the only adult in the race, but he has zero chance of winning.</comment>

<comment>"Hillary is a grownup"Granny warmonger is Too Big To Jail. But its nice to know a Democrat doesnt have to be President to undermine our national security. She can do it in the comfort of her own server room.</comment>

<comment>I'm certainly not a fan of Hillary's but she is not offering magical solutions and has a record of substance (not a good one, but a real one).</comment>

<comment>Record of substance? What legislation did she introduce?  Her foreign policy substance?  What was her landmark accomplishment there?</comment>

<comment>She was a senator and a secretary of state.</comment>

<comment>I'm aware of that.  Can you name anything more specific that a job title?  I will ask again: What legislation did she introduce as a Senator?  What was her landmark accomplishment as Secretary of State?</comment>

<comment>She was bad in government, with few real accomplishments.  I would take, for example, Kasich in a heartbeat over her.  But she has been in government for many years, in important positions.  She is not an amateur.  For this reason I would trust her more than, say, I would trust Trump.To repeat myself, on the one hand you have a surgeon with malpractice cases pending and numerous complaints.  On the other hand you have a guy off the street who bought a surgeon costume from a novelty store and some sharp knives and insists he'll do a "great" job.You wouldn't want either one to operate on you, but you'd still rather have the former operate on you than the latter.</comment>

<comment>"You wouldn't want either one to operate on you, but you'd still rather have the former operate on you than the latter."That would be true if those two were your only choices.  If someone is bad at their job "She was bad in government" (which btw, is really the only job she's ever had.  She never really practiced as a lawyer.) , they should either get demoted or fired, never promoted.</comment>

<comment>Right, the 'substance' of such failure, mendacity and non-accomplishment that people are turning to populist demagogues like Sanders and Trump to escape such nonsense.</comment>

<comment>If Hillary is a surgeon with a record of license suspensions and malpractice cases, Trump or Sanders are children who bought a surgeon costume at a novelty store and have some sharp kitchen knives.You wouldn't want any of them operating on you, but clearly the latter two would be worse than the former.</comment>

<comment>I would concur Sanders' tax plans feature unrealistic projections but at least he proposes actually paying for things; the Republicans just soldier on with the trickle-down voodoo tripe . .we'll eliminate capital gains, eliminate estate taxes, cut the rich's rate by 15-20%, de-regulate Wall Street and voila! everyone is a winner!!! All while we shuffle another trillion into a Middle East land war.Republicans are NOT the party of fiscal responsibility by a long shot.</comment>

<comment>Sanders' tax plan are a recipe for another Great Depression.He will crater the economy.And the people he is catering to are NOT the taxpayers. Same old BS. It's funny who Trump is the worst person in the world for catering to the anti-'muzzie' voters ... but Sanders does the EXACT same thing in his own way, by attacking the 1%. All Sanders would have to do is throw in a few comments about Jews and it would be straight out of nazi playbook.  The main difference is Sanders would enact real economic pain on the producers and top in the economy. To the point of killing the goose that lays the eggs.Sanders and Trump are more alike than either side would want to admit. Its populism, and populism thrives on creating enemies.</comment>

<comment>So increasing taxes on the rich and railing about Wall Street = the Nazi scapegoating of Jews.And who says your modern Republican Party is out of touch? Lol . . .</comment>

<comment>national socialists and other socialists are pretty much mind-numbed collectivist peas in the same pod, and the politics of jew-envy then and 1%-envy now are not far apart.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats aren't blameless, they've cravenly let the GOP push peoples' buttons without calling them out on it,  but Trump is running as a Republican and is winning Republican primaries and caucuses.  I doubt the Republicans can stop him from getting their nomination, I only hope the Democrats can prevail in November.</comment>

<comment>LOL. You're acting as though the Democrats do not do exactly the same thing.You're such a partisan hack.</comment>

<comment>I guess it's easy to insult people when you don't bother to read their posts.</comment>

<comment>You literally just blamed the Democrats for not blaming the GOP. You're an Idiot.</comment>

<comment>You literally just proved my point.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry you're a moron.Truly.</comment>

<comment>Brilliant analysis, there.</comment>

<comment>I thought so. Tell me more about how it's not ever the democrats fault. *snicker*</comment>

<comment>FWIW, Trump is winning because of Democrats and independents who have voted in GOP primaries. Trump got 50% of the independent vote in the NH primary, and independents were 50% of the vote. had it been Republicans only in NH, Trump would have gotten under 20%, ie barely above Kasich.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump-he's got what plants crave.</comment>

<comment>Carbon dioxide?sorry...</comment>

<comment>see above, replied to wrong comment</comment>

<comment>Sunshine? Rain? He is a sunny rainmaker.</comment>

<comment>If by sunny rainmaker you mean populist rabble rouser, then yes! You know though, even though he is legit crazy, it's good that he gets the civic juices flowing.</comment>

<comment>Just my daily Idiocracy reference.</comment>

<comment>Good timing with that. Idiocracy writer now thinks the movie has become reality.http://www.thedailybeast.com/c...</comment>

<comment>Thanks. To be clear though, I am applying this only to the candidate. Even though I so totally disagree with his supporters, I assume they can all read.</comment>

<comment>must be the electrolytes:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Looking forward to the State of the Union:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Godwilling we should be so lucky.</comment>

<comment>Oh look, it's almost like every meme is retarded.Of course there's not a ceiling.I run to the left of Hillary on foreign intervention.I run to the right of Hillary on gun control.I run to the left of Cruzio on abortion.To the right of Cruzio on immigration.To the left of Cruzio on religion.To the right of Cruzio on migrants.I won.</comment>

<comment>So sez the meme ....</comment>

<comment>That's actually not really that innaccurate.  The running to the left of Hillary on foreign intervention is situational, and he hasn't really been very clear on how he would assassinate the family members of ISIS.  This generally accurate list is why I've come to the realization that Trump may just be the least horrible choice left in the GOP field.  Not that there is any chance in hell that I would vote for him in the general, but if the republican primary is still open when it gets to New York, I will go vote for him.  Trump is just disgusting and frightening, Cruz and Rubio are disgusting and terrifying.</comment>

<comment>A candidate who hasn't explained the details behind any of his significant "policies" isn't running to the left or right of anyone.At this point, the Donald is all slogans and no substance.  In a sense, he's running with or beneath substance-less blowhards like Anne Coulter.</comment>

<comment>NoSubstance.jpeg. Slogans.gifAny more talking points?</comment>

<comment>Ok, wake me up when you get to the part where you argue the Donald's "policies" do, in fact, have substance.</comment>

<comment>Most substantive policies of anyone in the race. Thank you for asking.</comment>

<comment>Zzzzz...</comment>

<comment>LMAO. You poor baby.Please keep using the "Non substance" meme.It looks stupid, and makes you look ignorant.Yet you insist upon using it.</comment>

<comment>Zzzzz...[Still waiting for you to explain how, precisely, the Donald would implement his magical thinking]</comment>

<comment>Notice how it's only Republicans who have to give specifics. Hillary wants to continue a failed Obama foreign policy,  but I say she's a disaster, and you whine about specifics.Solid.Come back when you're ready to be educated.</comment>

<comment>Zzzzz...</comment>

<comment>I love your trolling. Thank you. Please continue to show how ignorant you are.I have the most substantive policies of any candidate.</comment>

<comment>Zzzzz...[I could have sworn I heard something, but that something absolutely wasn't a description of Donald's specific policy proposals.  There was a bit of screaming, and some random frustrated utterances, and something about Obama.  Yawn.]</comment>

<comment>Dude, you literally don't care.That's the thing. I've given specific policies. Over and over.And yet you keep whining."Hurr durr, how is wall going to be built?"At some point you have to be an adult.</comment>

<comment>Zzzz...[Such thin skin.  Oh lord, you're too easy, pretend Donald. And still no substance.  Keep freaking out.  And please, for the love of all things holy, don't actually provide policy details.  I'd hate for this to end.]</comment>

<comment>Please keep whining. Love it.</comment>

<comment>Zzzz...[Where can I get a good sombrero around here? This blazing orange sun is totally harshing my nap.]</comment>

<comment>So the very specific policies don't work for you?Got it.Later, troll!</comment>

<comment>Zzzz...[I wonder how ling this guy will keep going? And still no policies]</comment>

<comment>I wonder how long you'll keep whining. Probably forever.You can't even say what you want specifics about.</comment>

<comment>You can read more about his key policies on his website (donaldjtrump.com).</comment>

<comment>There's a very good chance Trump's tax returns will show huge deductions claimed for orange dye, Russia mail order bride exchange fees and  annual payments to bone spur specialist expert witnesses.</comment>

<comment>The article quotes Cruz as saying, “Donald Trump … has a passionate, committed base of supporters, but he’s got a ceiling—between 60 and 70 percent of Republican primary voters.”  This has cut the quote off at a crucial point.  The rest of the quote from the link says ,"between 60 and 70 percent of Republican primary voters recognize that Donald is not the best candidate to go head-to-head with Hillary Clinton,"</comment>

<comment>I noticed that too! The way they cut off the quote changes the meaning to the exact opposite of what he actually said.</comment>

<comment>Still, Trump has an incredibly high unfavorability rating amongst the general populace. What worries me is that that too will start disappearing if Trump can successfully pivot after the primaries. Facing Clinton in the general, he has a real shot at winning. He can't beat Sanders, but a Bloomberg entry in that scenario might doom everyone.</comment>

<comment>Bloomberg-because every Republican wants to limit soda sizes and take away all our guns.</comment>

<comment>A pretty detailed piece - but the author surprisingly failed to note a key point : that establishment Republican pundits claimed that after Bush dropped out - his votes in Nevada would go to establishment candidates like Rubio or Kasich - thus narrowing the gap with "Mr. Ceiling" Trump.Nothing like that happened at all - as we know, the establishment candidates failed to increase, while Trump increased significantly.</comment>

<comment>"Most remarkably of all, Trump almost ties Rubio among former supporters of Jeb Bush."Well he mentioned it with respect to polling if not the actual Nevada results.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - I agree, that is a related observation.</comment>

<comment>We agree on something! Ha! (Well I also agree that Trump is better than Cruz).</comment>

<comment>I am actually a lot less disagreeable than I appear to be. Often, when I agree I say nothing.</comment>

<comment>I'll say that I've noticed that...can't prove it though.</comment>

<comment>Political journalism needs to grow some balls and say what's needed to be said for quite some time: the American people, and GOP voters in particular, are morons.I know that's not nice, and comes off as elitist, but at a time when egos rule and not apologizing shows strength, it's a badly needed truth. It's also already a core unsaid assumption in political reporting where political strategies and messages are analyzed for their impact on the "average American voter."By pussyfooting around the idiocy of the populace, we not only treat them like children in need of participation trophies, but we've emboldened them to believe that their views are equally valid and that their voice should be just as loud as people who know what they're talking about. They don't understand shame or embarrassment because nobody is willing to call them out, and instead they have a whole echo chamber of pandering media specifically designed to provide them emotional comfort.Sure the GOP is responsible for Trump, but so is the political media who've given equal weight to well-thought-out nuanced ideas and ideas that are the intellectual equivalent of a crayon smear on drywall.</comment>

<comment>TBH, I'd like to institute a test for voting:  a four year college degree from an accredited institution, i.e. not University of Phoenix, and ownership of a passport that had a stamp from at least one foreign country *in addition to* Mexico, Canada, or any of the Caribbeans islands.</comment>

<comment>I would exclude you from voting on the basis of low intelligence - since you apparently think that setting foot on foreign soil magically makes you smart.</comment>

<comment>No, but travel abroad indicates that one has some basic level of curiosity and interest in the world around him, and experience with other cultures could certainly inform one's worldview.But thanks for playing.</comment>

<comment>Spud, you're the lowest common denominator in any deck.  You calling someone of low intelligence is pretty silly.Know thyself.</comment>

<comment>Not magically, and not smart, but it can grant you a degree of awareness. Even if you spent a lot of the trip inebriated.;)</comment>

<comment>After college I went on a bus tour of Europe with some American "students". We visited almost every country in Europe.While I was checking out museums and castles, the other tour members were going to McDonalds and then getting drunk and vomiting.They were just as dumb after the trip compared to beforehand,</comment>

<comment>I'd be happy if they could simply demonstrate that they understand that WWE style tough talking is not leadership, public spending is not automatically socialism, and that countries should not be 'run like a business'.</comment>

<comment>That would take us down to like 10% of the population. Keep in mind that most Americans who've traveled abroad are military veterans or dependents. Neither necessarily get a passport stamped on the way (though it's more common with the dependents.)Make yours an either travel abroad (civilian passport or military travel) OR let's say two year degree, and I might agree. Otherwise it's way too narrow.</comment>

<comment>Deal!</comment>

<comment>Can't do that, it's in the same category as GOP efforts to raise the voting age to 35 or ban the poor from voting. You're trying to put a voting restriction in place on a group that doesn't vote the way you want them to.</comment>

<comment>what an elitistHow about: no one can vote unless they've visited the Deep South and immersed themselves in the culture of the South AND visited NYC or San Francisco. This should give American citizens a better perspective on their country than visiting foreign countries.Foreign countries are nice, but they are foreign... Traveling abroad won't make you understand why Montanans who live 100 miles from the nearest Police Department "cling to their guns" or why NYC that has such a dense population is so opposed to the idea of owning guns.And college isn't for everyone. First, it's expensive, and second some people just don't like it, they'd rather learn a trade. Are these people less worthy of a voice in our democracy?</comment>

<comment>My post was tongue in cheek.  Sort of.The point is, being a citizen and voting in elections is actually an incredible responsibility.  And there are a lot of stupid people who are fncking up our Republic because they vote based on what they "believe."  It doesn't matter what you "believe."  Evolution is real.  Climate change is real.  Tax cuts for the 1% and "trickle down" economics don't work.  Only people who are educated, curious, and willing to learn, and who demonstrate those characteristics, should be allowed to vote.  Hence my benchmarks.</comment>

<comment>I understand. But I think it's a bit preposterous to suggest that there is an absolute truth and that you know it. That evolution and climate change are real may seem like rock solid facts, but where do you draw the line dividing what's true and untrue?How do you know that trickle down economics doesn't work for sure? That transgenderism is a real thing? That guns cause more or less deaths? That people oppose Obama because they're racist? Or that Obama governs with a more left-wing agenda than the average American president because he hates traditional America?I can find arguments in favor or against all of these issues. These questions are mostly a matter of opinion, and I trust the majority to get to the right conclusions, or at least to a good compromise, because of the diversity of the electorate.In education there is an element of indoctrination, mostly subconscious. In my experience, most professors are liberal and find conservative views ridiculous and they pass their biases on to their students. So more education does not necessarily mean better informed.I think it's pretty neat that people who live on a farm in Montana, or in a posh apartment in Manhattan or in a ghetto in south Chicago can all come together and decide what is best for everyone in the country.</comment>

<comment>I have come across far too many college students (including some that I taught), who seem almost incapable of thinking for themselves and who barely follow what's going on in the political world at all. I would rather have an increase in the minimum age to vote than some sort of college requirement. I've met many skilled workers who never went to college with far more common sense and knowledge than those who have. (This isn't a blanket condemnation of our university system, however; I have a Ph.D. myself).</comment>

<comment>So who is smart, then? You? Any proof of that?</comment>

<comment>Anyone that acknowledges that logic is useful, that empiricism is better than feelings, that data trumps anecdotes, that vocabulary can expand intelligence, that intellectualism should be valued, that substance is more important than volume, that expertise is better than wild guesses, and that conclusions should follow their premises.You don't have to be intelligent to grasp these concepts, but if you reject them, as many Americans do, then you're a moron.</comment>

<comment>Yep, incredibly low standards. Don't have to know anything, don't have to have any analytical ability, don't have to have any intellectual curiosity, just have to meet with the approval of the guy doing the counting. How dreadfully unsurprising. </comment>

<comment>Reading comprehension is important too.Oh, and so is knowing when someone is clearly incapable or unwilling to understand basic points and ending the conversation.</comment>

<comment>Reeling off a list of platitudes is about as useful and insightful as basing your list of The Right Sort Of People on what God told you in your dreams. Keep up the self-congratulation, though; if there's one surefire sign of intelligence, that must be it.</comment>

<comment>Right.  What one "believes" about, e.g., climate change based on one's preconceived ideological worldview is not equally valid with a view based on empirical evidence.  One may not "believe" that 2+2=4 but that doesn't make it any less true.</comment>

<comment>Did you just say something profound here?  Oh, let me add a few platitudes.Water is wet. The sky is blue. I wish they all could be California girls.</comment>

<comment>>the American people, and GOP voters in particular, are morons.Not including you and your friends and family, I'm sure.Oh, and by the way: do you have political science, sociology and media studies PhDs? Cause if not, where do you get off running your mouth? </comment>

<comment>I've had the luxury of being able to excise the racists and simpletons from my circle of friends over the years.I've also been lucky to have a family that instilled in me a strong curiosity and thirst for knowledge. I don't always agree with them, but they value thinking and intellectualism.</comment>

<comment>Prove it. I suspect your standards are too low, and you've just constructed a comfortable echo chamber. </comment>

<comment>Dear Republican Party, The good news is that you're getting another registered Republican voter, a diligent one who makes it a point to vote in every election.The bad news is that I'm only switching my affiliation from Independent in order to vote for Donald Trump. Make of that what you will!</comment>

<comment>That's only bad news for establishment insiders with a vested interest in the success of someone like Rubio or Kasich.</comment>

<comment>I make it out to be low info</comment>

<comment>I read The Atlantic and listen to NPR all day long; how uninformed can I be? lol</comment>

<comment>I don't blame you. I'm the only person worth voting for.</comment>

<comment>I'm someone who would have shown up as against Trump in early polls and for Trump in later ones. My reservations from early polls (that he doesn't have relevant experience, that deporting 11 million people is unrealistic) are more than compensated for by what Trump has become. This is less about Trump the man now and more about Trump the movement. Trump recognizes that. His rhetoric on the campaign trail has changed. He knows he has become the figurehead of something much bigger than him.The left is built on an endemic hatred of men, of white people, of Western civilization, of capitalism, and the values therein. The anti-left is uniting behind Trump in the first counterassault against all this hatred. The Trump campaign at this point is a movement about the people who create wealth retaking control of the country from the people who consume it.</comment>

<comment>pretty sure anyone who votes from trump is squarely in the not-creating-too-much-wealth crowd...</comment>

<comment>Remember, he loves the "poorly educated."  They are his base.  Pretty sure that they're not "job creators," in the parlance of the last election.</comment>

<comment>Yeah - the Dem base are not "job creators" either.</comment>

<comment>The job creators are such a small group compared to Americans with less than a four year college degree, that it is only logical to claim the less educated. Romney didn't get this. Trump does. He's a marketing genius if nothing else.</comment>

<comment>Well, you know what PT Barnum said.</comment>

<comment>Well said. Bravo. Trump happens to be the leader of the movement because he had the foresight to seize the reins when the opportunity presented itself - but that is also true of many leaders - right place, right time.</comment>

<comment>right place, right time, wrong candidate</comment>

<comment>So long Trump keeps throwing the Overton Window towards stupid, the more normal and electable he will seem.</comment>

<comment>Consider the collateral damage a Trump nomination would inflict.The Trump campaign claims it is benefiting from cross over democrat votes.Trump may have secured these democrats votes but he hasn't flipped their ideology.These democrats WILL NOT be voting for Republicans or conservatives in your local and state elections.Trump is a dream come true for the lying, scummy democrats.</comment>

<comment>By Rubio and Cruz's logic, that would mean 80% of the Republican Party (respectively) does not see them as fit to be President.I love how Trump is making the George Wills and Erik "I'm too scared to see Star Wars because of ISIS" Eriksons of the world eat their words. He's single handily exposing the "Republican intelligentsia" for what it is  . . a bunch of hacks and 3rd rate losers.</comment>

<comment>Anyone with a brain would reject Trump out of hand.  What's disturbing is how many brainless Americans there are.Trump is a racist, misogynist, hater, without a substantive idea in his head except his own self-promotion.</comment>

<comment>Yep .... Trump is your typical racist, misogynist, hateful democrat</comment>

<comment>You are a brand new kind of stupid.  Check your diarreah-mouth.  Saying a lot is not the same as saying something clever.  Quite the opposite.</comment>

<comment>Cruz and Rubio will hammer Trump tonight on his tax returns and Trump University.</comment>

<comment>and his bank fraud charges</comment>

<comment>I sure hope so. They don't have any real issues so they have to do that.</comment>

<comment>It won't matter. Every republican candidate has the same old worn out ideas and lines.</comment>

<comment>a lot better than the stone age ideas the stupid democrats keep coming up with</comment>

<comment>And Trump's supporters won't care.  Their lives are crap, Trump addresses their real grievances (no matter how unrealistic his solutions)  and in this context Trump's tax returns are irrelevant to them.</comment>

<comment>The media has stressed his outrageous statements but Trump's actual positions are more mainstream than the traditional Republicans. If you want to take him down, you need to go after him on character issues.  Look at his casino bankruptcies, Trump University, and the pyramid schemes.  Go find some of his more outrageous reality TV antics and ask if this is the temperament of someone you want in the White House.</comment>

<comment>Mainstream = Liberal Democrat</comment>

<comment>Trump is a moderate on most issues. Forget immigration he can't do anything about that w/o congress. The republicans in congress have promised prosperity for the middle class for yrs and delivered disaster. Even the people who vote for him know he's full of sheet however he isn't a lying member of congress who simply wants a slice of Wall St's campaign money. The republicans created Trump and now he scares them to death. I won't vote for Trump because I'm not sure he would appoint as a SC justice.All the rest of the Republican candidates are just more of the same trickle down that doesn't work except for a few. I'd vote for Bernie but that probably won't happen so i'll hold my nose, try to avoid the stench and vote for Hillary simply because of the SC issue.</comment>

<comment>another one issue voter .... that's how we ended up with that uneducated moron Obama</comment>

<comment>another uneducated voter led easily by misinformation.</comment>

<comment>Only a blind Republican could look at a former law professor with degrees from Columbia and Harvard and call him uneducated. </comment>

<comment>Obama doesn't have ANY degrees ... show me the transcripts that prove me wrong.</comment>

<comment>Want the long form?</comment>

<comment>I'd be happy with any form</comment>

<comment>Schools don't release transcripts just because some fool wants them. Go back to reading your conspiracy weekly mag.</comment>

<comment>"Collages" .... they don't release educated people either these days if that's how you spell "Colleges"</comment>

<comment>Affirmative action, according to BHO.</comment>

<comment>AA help gets you in. It doesn't get you through out and up.</comment>

<comment>Trump says he's going to build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.In other words .... no wall will ever be built.</comment>

<comment>I wonder how many Trump groupies are unaware there are already hundreds of miles of fences, roving armed border patrols, IR cameras, armed checkpoints, etc.</comment>

<comment>yep ... that only require enforcement</comment>

<comment>And you will be no doubt upset when the lax security gets tightened up.  No logic there - but upset you will be nonetheless. Maybe you will miss the extra illegal dem voters.</comment>

<comment>Those dimwits are actually saying "Mr Trump can build the wall, he built skyscrapers!"  Oh the stupid, it hurts.</comment>

<comment>Trump builds all kinds of things for government - successfully and under budget, and cost-effective.</comment>

<comment>Like what?</comment>

<comment>Wollman Rink.</comment>

<comment>A skating rink? Very impressive accomplishment. I guess he should be president or something.</comment>

<comment>The Democratic-run city government tried and failed, so they asked him to do it and he succeeded  - profitably - according to the NY Times.Obama never accomplished anything more than flapping his lips and making speeches before he was elected.</comment>

<comment>Like I say...he clearly should be president. Skating rinks for everyone.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you understand the scale of the project. It cost 2.2 million dollars! It was basically a second Panama Canal.</comment>

<comment>Trump's current project on Pennsylvania Ave. between the Capitol and the White House (a luxury hotel in the Old Post Office Building) is two years ahead of schedule and significantly under budget. There have actually been several examples of Trump building more cheaply and rapidly than almost everyone else in the same business.</comment>

<comment>I guess we're just waiting for Mexico to pay up.</comment>

<comment>He could not even build a resort in Mexico.  His Baja project failed, was never built and investors had to sue him to recover costs !</comment>

<comment>Maybe that's why he's p*ssed at Mexico.</comment>

<comment>Most I would imagine realize we already have partial and sporadic border protections. Many Republicans have been talking about finishing the wall since the 1990s. In his 2011 book, Time to Get Tough, Trump wrote about the effectiveness of the walls and fences we already had, but called out our lack of strong leaders willing to finish the job. He especially focused on the high-tech triple wall in the Mesa, AZ sector of the border, which he saw as a great success.</comment>

<comment>It's like you really don't realize what tariffs are.</comment>

<comment>He has several strategies listed on his website under "positions" on how he will get Mexico to pay for the wall.</comment>

<comment>"We're going to be so busy winning that you're not even going to notice you're still broke and unemployed" - Trump</comment>

<comment>Well, not necessarily unemployed. Maybe we'll get the sorts of high quality jobs that they have in China, once we start our trade war with them. Anyone interested in a nice Foxconn gig? 12 cents and hour AND Sundays off.</comment>

<comment>"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN .... for me" - Trump</comment>

<comment>Has anyone tried polling Italians who supported Benito Mussolini?  I'm sure the level of support would be high.</comment>

<comment>Il Duce Donald made the beauty pageants run on time.</comment>

<comment>You are right. It is a safe bet that supporters of Mussolini supported Mussolini.</comment>

<comment>Apparent support for Mussolini was very high - until just before they strung him up.His granddaughter was a fascist in their parliament for years.  Apparently she was confident that Italians would be more forgiving is she ever gained power.  I know a few Italians and I doubt it.</comment>

<comment>I bet if you dug further they simply don't agree with a dictator like Lincoln who tore apart the country.</comment>

<comment>You're breaking character and mixing your own stupid views with Trump's. He would never say that about Lincoln, whom I'm sure he'd describe as a fabulous, super-talented, terrific president.</comment>

<comment>Someone who tore apart the country and is responsible for the loss of life bigger than any on this soil?No. I think he was a joke.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you do. Now get back in character.</comment>

<comment>Whine less.</comment>

<comment>There you go. Now you're back on track, speaking in off-topic generalities.</comment>

<comment>You realize all of my policies are specific right? </comment>

<comment>It's not a question of what I realize or don't. They aren't specific. Government policies are about the how? far more than the what? Only dullards confuse the former with the latter. Fortunately for Mr. Trump, the country is full of dullards, and we know he "LOVVVES the poorly educated."</comment>

<comment>Presumably Donald Trump would have negotiated his way to freeing the slaves without a shot being fired.</comment>

<comment>Like Lincoln wanted to free the slaves lol </comment>

<comment>So what would Donald Trump have done in Lincoln's place. Other than not go to the theater.</comment>

<comment>By the way, liberal slate.com points out that the same poll found that five percent of blacks disagree with the Emancipation Proclamation.Or else maybe there is something confusing about the format of the questions?http://www.slate.com/blogs/the...BTW, according to CNN - a significant number of Trump supporters are former Obama supporters - so I guess they must be very intelligent, right progressive?http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/08/...</comment>

<comment>"...and Ted Cruz claim that, as the field narrows, a more traditional candidate will emerge to overcome the Trump phenomenon. They’re wrong."Thats only darwanism.AKA, the truth.</comment>

<comment>The wall just got ten feet taller.And Mexico is going to pay for it. Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Be sure and send them a past due notice for what's already there.</comment>

<comment>No thanks. Not interested in having them pay for others' failures.</comment>

<comment>One pound of cocaine per mile of fence.  Deal?</comment>

<comment>More concerned about the hundreds of billions lost in trade deals with them.</comment>

<comment>2000 pounds of cocaine for your wall.  That's a big volume of trade right there.</comment>

<comment>In other words Trumps fans have been right from day one and his haters have been wrong.</comment>

<comment>Doomed. We're all doomed.</comment>

<comment>I fear that, unfortunately, we may not be as doomed as we are fated to be.</comment>

<comment>NYT report today shows trumps' Mar-a-Lago in Florida has not hired Americans for years !  The resort made 500+ work visa applications for mainly Romanians because... cheap labour !  This chump is a two-faced liar.</comment>

<comment>Prior to being a politician. Thanks though!</comment>

<comment>That's an interesting idea.  Nothing you did prior to being a politician counts.  You got a clean slate the first time you announced your candidacy.</comment>

<comment>I agree. Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Who gives a flying fart when it was?</comment>

<comment>Voters, dear.</comment>

<comment>Not me.  Once a shyster, always a shyster.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz? Agreed.</comment>

<comment>Haaaaaaaaa. Yeah the attacks on Trump are gonna start working any minute after failing for 7 months. Keep spinning those wheels loser.</comment>

<comment>It is called a fact.  I suppose that if one cared about Americans having jobs, it could be considered an attack.</comment>

<comment>I'm just curious, do you reject negative reports about Trump's own business practices, especially pertaining to the hiring of illegal immigrants, because you don't believe them, or because you don't care if they're true or not?</comment>

<comment>These are temporary seasonal jobs filled by European college students. This has nothing to do with permanent jobs that are filled to replace Americans, like on H1-B visas.My kids' camp has some foreign counselors - also Americans go abroad to do temp jobs, too. They balance out.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that also true for trade in general? We gain export jobs, while losing some internal market jobs?</comment>

<comment>Nope.</comment>

<comment>Nope? We don't gain any export jobs through trade?</comment>

<comment>China is taking Trump seriouslyhttp://freebeacon.com/politics...http://dailycaller.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>That's because an actual man is saying he will be tough on them.Obama's not really a man,</comment>

<comment>Bad as Trump is, he sure beats the "normal" Republicans who have been trying to turn the country into something like the Confederacy and starting unnecessary wars.</comment>

<comment>Non-interventionist foreign policy.Let Russia deal with ISIS.Actually get along with Russia.Be tough on China (tariffs, currency manipulation, etc.)Strong on immigration (actual wall, actually enforcing border laws, mass deportation, stop the drug flow, make Mexico pay for the wall).Strong on Second Amendment. Strong on Migration, Freeze visas to Muslim Migrants. End the marriage visa loophole, punish those who overstay visas.Pro America trade deals. No TPP.Rip up the Iran deal.I'm not sure what's not to like. Trump haters are kind of stupid.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. The issue is that we have an entire generation that has been brainwashed in government run schools to believe that free trade and open borders is actually good for them. </comment>

<comment>That's the other thing. Common Core is a trainwreck. The education system in general is a clusterfuark.</comment>

<comment>The Trump Train says otherwise.  People feel it in the suffering of their families as jobs are shipped out.</comment>

<comment>Some shipped out, others were automated, others lost to competition, others had wages and benefits cut when factories moved to the southern states that lack unions.Bringing back manufacturing jobs is like trying to bring back farm labor jobs. The economy doesn't support very many of them any longer.</comment>

<comment>"The Economy" is just some mystical force over which we have no control.</comment>

<comment>The government has very little control. It doesn't invent much outside aerospace, doesn't decide where to manufacture products, can't force someone to hire or fire.We can levy tariffs, but its a 2 way street. I think this mythology that Trump can bring lost manufacturing jobs back here is just that. And I'm not a free trade advocate by any means.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, those damn schools teaching kids about history. Here's one that I remember from high school. Go look up "Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930."</comment>

<comment>There are no open borders in the US. You can prove this to yourself by leaving your passport behind, then try and get back in.</comment>

<comment>There's something there for anyone who isn't a total freak, and we don't want those people around anyway.Trump is Americanism in action.</comment>

<comment>I keep forgetting some.Remove Obamacare.Remove Common Core.Allow China to deal with North Korea. Not be the world's police.Really simple stuff.</comment>

<comment>Awesome.  I haven't been this excited about politics in 30+ years.</comment>

<comment>There's a few more. Me personally? I want to roll out a few more ideas. Tearing up NAFTA (By the way, that's yet another thing Hillary can be nailed on)Removing foreign aid.I realize the House has the power of the purse, but we can publicly shame members of the house saying "hey, let's give billions to countries that hate us".Etc.So much more we can do.</comment>

<comment>There's much to be done.  If Trump gets three things accomplished, it'll be more than 50 Brigades of Establishment Republicans ever did for middle- and working-class Americans.</comment>

<comment>Wall, Mass Deportation, and Ban Muslim Immigration/Visas/MigrationAnd that's more than Obama/Bush/Clinton accomplished.</comment>

<comment>Wall. Tunnel. Ladder. Boat. Airplane.</comment>

<comment>Words you just learned?</comment>

<comment>Words you apparently have not encountered yet.</comment>

<comment>If you think Mr. Big Stick does not have world police wet dreams, you are a fool of the first order.</comment>

<comment>Was that his program last week or this week?</comment>

<comment>It's been the consistent platform throughout the campaign.</comment>

<comment>Has it? One week he wants to take oil fields in the ME, the next he wants Putin to do all the fighting for us. Stop the drug flow? WTF?</comment>

<comment>there could be possible upraising, possible civil war in the USA if the Republican party establishment attempts to shut out Mr. Trump anoints one of their referred choices to lead party.  Mr. Trump is the man of the people, the choice of the people who have suffered most in the USA poltical system of corruption</comment>

<comment>He's the choice of about one third of the people registered with one political party.</comment>

<comment>*Ceiling Meme*Like clockwork</comment>

<comment>Mr. Trump, let's Make America Great Again.</comment>

<comment>That's the plan.I love how it's been since June and the "No Substance" meme still persists. It's adorable.Apparently "Free Stuff for Dindus" is substance" but a variety of issues to deal with foreign policy aren't.</comment>

<comment>Like a land war paid for by oil wells, and Guatanamo filled with torture.  Why is it you hated the Bush family so much, Amateur Hour, with your goto John Bolton as a chaser?</comment>

<comment>YES "John Bolton" meme.Anything else?</comment>

<comment>Cause Bolton foreign policy is substance, eh? Substance abuse, more like, light weight.</comment>

<comment>(((John Bolton)))Memes</comment>

<comment>a good clear message that resonates with Americans people who have lost their freedoms and wealth</comment>

<comment>Is he going to re-enable labor unions?  Maybe mandate sick leave and maternity leave for all Americans?  You know, things that would actually help working Americans.Or is just going to shovel more meaningless pablum about "winning".</comment>

<comment>Another policy wonk?Good lord.</comment>

<comment>Pablum it is then!</comment>

<comment>I don't know what he can or cannot do.  He probably can't do it all, but he'll make a great start on stuff that 75% of Americans find reasonable, which probably includes stuff like what you're talking about.My Union Epiphany was when I noticed a large aerospace company had an engineer's union.  As an engineer myself, I found that appalling.  A company whose management was so bad it would drive professionals  (in the old sense; like lawyers and doctors) to form a union.I've been generally pro-union since then.  Most establishment politics is just trying to make us line up with what Big Business expects of us.</comment>

<comment>AMA is to an extent a union for physicians.</comment>

<comment>A high school educated (or less) guy doesn't have a job on which he can support a family, because the factory moved to China, and the remaining work has salaries driven down by competition from hungry Mexicans willing to work for less.  Mandated sick leave and maternity leave are low on the list of his priorities.</comment>

<comment>Moreover, the choice of marginalized and powerless people.</comment>

<comment>And a year ago, he was nobody's choice.</comment>

<comment>Last time I checked he hit 46% in Nevada - but maybe you slept through that.</comment>

<comment>That was a caucus, not a primary.</comment>

<comment>Shhh don't tell anyone.</comment>

<comment>46% of what....2% of the eligible voters?</comment>

<comment>that is what the USA media/political system wants you to believe but if you see the actual facts Mr. Trump had wide support amount amount the 99% who have been left behind economically in the USA during past decade.   Mr. Trump also does well in among all peoples including Latin Americans, the blacks, women and USA military troops.  Much can be said of Mr. Sanders as well for same reasons.</comment>

<comment>It's not a question of belief.  It's what the results of the elections have shown.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  A majority that does not make!</comment>

<comment>We see that majority supports Mr. Trump and or Mr. Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Proud liberal? That's an oxymoron if I've ever seen one.</comment>

<comment>I don't engage with knuckle draggers such as yourself.</comment>

<comment>USFL owners? Atlantic City casino goers? A man of the people, Donald Trump: Gotta a wall from coast to coast you are interested in purchasing, my friend? Bridge to nowhere, thrown in.</comment>
