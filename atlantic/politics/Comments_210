<comment>Bernie is never going to win.</comment>

<comment>The collective American Citizen loans banker's money at the rate of .25% through the Fed.Those same banker's now sell the money back to the American Citizen at the rate of 3.25% to  29.99% pocketing the profits from the access to cheap capital from the collective American Citizen through the Fed.This is actually already the money of the collective American Citizen being loaned back to the American Citizen through the Banker's.The American Citizen should be able to get loans directly from the Fed at the rate .25%The Government Accountability Office should audit every dollar ever spent by the federal government including the Fed.The Government Accountability Office should audit every dollar ever spent or received by any political candidates or organizations.</comment>

<comment>Right, when those banks failed they should have been folded into the Fed as a 'direct-to-consumer' national retail banking arm.</comment>

<comment>Personally, I'd vote for Bernie if he had more foreign policy experience. I just think in this day & age, with all that's going on in the world, we need someone who has experience in that area.</comment>

<comment>What's needed is someone with knowledge and good judgement. That's senator Sanders. Hillary had her chance as Secretary of state and made a mess of the middle east. No more regime change. It takes more than flying around the world to develop good judgement. #goberniego</comment>

<comment>the Bushies made a mess of the Middle East with their arrogant, feckless invasion of Iraq, wishful-thinking American Foreign Policy - i.e. spreading democracy - made a mess of the middle east.  Instead of pushing for the strongmen to "step down", we should have been supporting them and finding ways to work on their human rights issues.  Instead we sat on our hands when Mubarak fell and... chaos. Quadaffi - chaos and we keep insisting Assad has to go. Ok, who comes in after him?  Chances are not an entity who wants to play nice with the West.  we never seem to learn.</comment>

<comment>The Iraqi invasion and the Arab Spring were two different things.How should we have responded to the Arab Spring?</comment>

<comment>maybe by trying to work with the various strongmen on their human rights issues, not by insisting they all must go and go now.  Mubarak served us well for what, 40 years?  then we showed him the door.  their tourism industry is in the terlet now - bringing poverty and sending people into the arms of extremists.</comment>

<comment>I agree Bush started the mess. Hillary voted for the war and recently pushed for toppling Gaddafi in Libya and she still wants Assad to go.  Her foreign policy goes hand in hand with the republicans and the military industrial complex.</comment>

<comment>Radical Islam started the mess.</comment>

<comment>We started the mess by trying to put our puppets in place.  We need to let them work out their own issues.  And stop trying to push our agenda.If we focused on renewable energy we could get away from the middle east and be true leaders.But instead we meddle in their countries so oil companies can continue to make money.</comment>

<comment>Well, if we are going to be truthful, our foreign policy in the middle east starting back in the 60s, created much of the hatred of the west. You need to remember, we were the oppressors.</comment>

<comment>The worst part about her is the political ideology that she will have to serve, "Are women tough enough to protect the United States?"  ...and she will make her bones by starting another war to prove that women can handle the office of the president and make war.It is guaranteed she will have to do this.</comment>

<comment>Which is why I couldn't support her.</comment>

<comment>I was agreeing with you until you brought up Mubarak.  Obama did not sit on his hands.  Rather, he gave billions to the terrorist organization Muslim Brotherhood.</comment>

<comment>I don't think Hillary "made a mess of the middle east". I think the middle east was well on it's way to being a "mess" before she even took over. Nothing that was done there would have ever saved that place.</comment>

<comment>I agree parts of the middle east were a mess, but her pushing to topple Gaddafi and now saying she wants Assad gone too? That's Iraq all over again. The middle east was a mess. Bush made it worse by taking out Hussein. Then Hillary pushed for taking out Gaddafi, now Libya is a mess. Now she wants to take out Assad. IMO her foreign policy, made it worse.</comment>

<comment>He voted against the Iraq War, that shows good judgement</comment>

<comment>He exercised the best judgment in Congress, when it came to:- Trade Policies- War in the Middle EastAnd, Sanders worked with Republicans to pass the most sweeping VA legislation in a generation in 2014.</comment>

<comment>That's an interesting statement. He has been watching, commenting on, and participating in foreign policy for many years. Furthermore, what is noticeable about his decisions in the past related to foreign policy is that his predictions for our actions are almost always accurate. This is in stark contrast to Clinton, who is quite often just as surprised as the rest of us by how thing end up actually working out. He is also very good at working out deals and bargains with people who disagree with him. It was a staple of the many projects he has done. His ability to find consensus and rally people behind those points, in my opinion, is exactly what we need at this time globally. </comment>

<comment>Like who? Also, as much as it sucks, there are a many leaders of countries that don't respect women in politics like we might in the USA.Anyone who votes for Iraq is off my short list. That's the wrong kind of experience, my friend.</comment>

<comment>Foreign policy is about judgment. Dick Cheney has a lot of foreign policy experience. Do you trust his judgment? I am confident that whatever decision Bernie makes, it is not for the benefit of the military-industrial complex.</comment>

<comment>He strongly urged Congress not to invade Iraq, when most of all the other politicians were caving to the political winds of the day. They should have heard his pleadings, his wisdom, that there would be unintended consequences (read: ISIS), it could be very costly (read: over $2,000,000,000,000), and result in much loss of life (over 6000 U.S. servicemen and women killed, tens of thousands injured, tens of thousands or Iraqis killed, untold grief and sorrow and indefinite ramifications for years to come). Foreign policy wisdom: war should be a LAST resort.</comment>

<comment>Just like Obama?</comment>

<comment>2.5 million individual donations(the most of any candidate in American history) says otherwise...</comment>

<comment>Right wingers and their hack journalist enablers want to hear more war and terror rhetoric, yawn.      Search "How mainstream is Bernie Sanders?" or read the polling results. Prepare to be shocked if you think he "can't win" the Democratic nomination.  He's already ahead of Obama's pace and the same pundits were insisting HRC, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Big Banks was "bound to win" in 2008.  Go Bernie!</comment>

<comment>Good luck. Obama at least was stealing delegates at this point, Bernie isn't.</comment>

<comment>You're in for quite a shock when you see the widespread Sanders support relentlessly minimized by the corporate media materialize and vote --- enjoy!</comment>

<comment>ugh you sound like a Trump supporter.Just as with Trump, that a lot of people won't vote for Bernie might just mean that a lot of people won't vote for Bernie, as opposed to it being a huge media conspiracy (in this case "corporate media" as opposed to "PC media"). And this is coming from someone who would vote for Bernie (if he wasn't going to already be out of the Primary by the time my state votes.)</comment>

<comment>There's NO EVIDENCE the fragment of voters who would rule him out by that criterion is more than those who would rule him IN precisely because of that same criterion.  None. And the role of corporate media is obvious: to protect profits generated by their ad revenue, not to cover the news with any objectivity, much less do something that's in the public interest for its own sake. You sound like a nitwit.</comment>

<comment>Calm down. You're trying to make enemies where there are none. My only point was that the most likely reason sanders doesnt seem to have enough support to win the primary, let alone the general, is that he doen't have enough support. Not enough people are willing to vote for him. The evidence is the only evidence we have, the polls. </comment>

<comment>There are problems with the polls that were not true in the past.  Many people have only cell phones which cannot legally be reached by random digit dialing the way line phones are.  That means it's much more expensive to do a telephone poll on cell phones than line phones.  Pollsters try to compensate by weighting those responses they receive on the admittedly underrepresented cell phone users but there is no way of knowing how good these corrections are.  The other factor is that a much higher proportion of those contacted refuse to answer the pollster's questions and are different in other demographic characteristics from those who do answer them.  The pollsters have methods to correct for this error also but there is no way to know how good they are.  The most responsible pollsters worry about these points.As far as Bernie is concerned it is generally agreed that his best support is among young voters who are the most likely to have cell phones.  It is possible but less certain that young voters are more likely to refuse to answer pollster's questions.  It is quite possible for these reasons that the polls may underestimate Bernie's support.</comment>

<comment>of course they aren't perfect but they are the best evidence available. And contrary to the collective memory lapse we seem to be having, Obama had overtook Clinton by early February 2008, so its not like they weren't predictive.</comment>

<comment>Yes the pollsters have been lucky so far in general, although there have been occasional wild outliers.  In general random errors tend to cancel out, but the real concern is that there might be a systematic bias.  We have had a few surprises of somebody winning by a lot more than the polls predicted and a few unforeseen upsets like Eric Cantor.  I have suggested a possible mechanism which would lead to polls underestimating the Sanders vote but we won't know whether that is the case until we get some actual election results.</comment>

<comment>What are you, comatose? Try actually reading about what's going on in the early states, Iowa and New Hampshire, because he has PLENTY of support and it will only grow larger as the campaign continues.  Go to the Des Moines Register site, for instance, and consider what it means for people to travel hundreds of miles to attend his events. HRC, Incorporated is in for a huge surprise!</comment>

<comment>You have been babbling about "not enough support" based on absolutely no evidence whatsoever, it's farcical. He has more donors than anyone else, broke Obama's record for that, and is  well-situated to beat HRC in both Iowa and New Hampshire, as well as drawing support in other early contests. You've been snowed by pundits talking out of their wazoo, the same pundits who dismissed Obama in 2008 in some cases.</comment>

<comment>http://www.realclearpolitics.c...I'll let you point to the poll that Bernie is leading Hillary outside of New Hampshire. Nationwide, he hasn't made much ground on her since august. She was roughly 10 points up on him then and she's roughly 10 points up on her now. Of course he could overtake her, its just unlikely especially since it seems she's learned lessons from 2008 about messaging.Like I said I'll be voting for him if he survives to my late primary. I just doubt that he will. You might want to temper your expectations is all. Hopefully an economic populist comes around the next cycle that is younger, savvier with media manipulation and doesn't have the weird baggage from the 70s that Bernie does. That would be a much stronger candidate.Edit: do you really think things like "babbling", "no evidence whatsoever" (when there is clearly evidence that is at least contradictory), indicating that I'm just brainwashed, comatose etc is at all persuasive? I want Bernie or another Bernie type of candidate to win. I actually think that you zealot types lower the chances of that happening. </comment>

<comment>I'm starting to be very disappointed in the left, almost as much as the right.  Well, not even close to be honest, but much more than I've ever been. I think it's the "opposite reaction" law of Physics, the wingnuts are driving normally sensible people way to the left.. and they are acting a little crazy. *sigh*</comment>

<comment>It is a paradigm case of BABBLING to cite "national polls," since they rule out all first-time voters as well as millions who have never previously supported any politician at all, and use the results to "prove" that Sanders trails Clinton. Those polls are almost completely meaningless. Your beaten down defeatism is what "lowers the chances" of him taking the nomination, which will be done state-by-state, precinct-by-precinct, not in some imaginary "national poll" conducted using dubious and/or irrelevant methods.   Your reference to "weird baggage from the 70s" is totally bizarre given ongoing federal investigations of HRC, Incorporated, as well as her more recent claim to have landed in Bosnia under fire etc. Sanders is BY FAR the more trusted candidate, across the board, in both parties among all currently running.</comment>

<comment>"National" poll based on 414 voters? Really? The confluence of scientific and other logical blunders which came together to tout that as a reliable predictor of the various races deserves study, with most of the participants over 55 to boot! No 18-34 year-olds, no first-time voters/caucus attendees, etc. It's farcical.  And even given the biases, the trend shows the race tightening, with the five point "margin of error" they allow.</comment>

<comment>Nina Turner.</comment>

<comment>So, the Atlantic journalists are right wing enablers?</comment>

<comment>You worked out the syllogism, congratulations!</comment>

<comment>You left out "hacks" though, so deduct points on that part.</comment>

<comment>Other than in NH, Bernie is well behind in the polls.  Your point?</comment>

<comment>Uh, which polls are those? He's beating every GOP candidate and leading Clinton among voters who are generally overlooked by the standard polls. Watch.</comment>

<comment>"Prepare to be shocked if you think he "can't win" the Democratic nomination."If I were you, I'd prepare for disappointment.</comment>

<comment>way to bury any actual reporting under some forced opinion about what Americans care about. We're not in danger from foreign attacks, we're in danger of succumbing to a dismal economic reality if we don't turn this ship around.why didn't you mention any of the in depth policies sanders purposed (for the first time) yesterday? it's the first anyone has heard of them.. wouldn't that be, you know, news?</comment>

<comment>False choice. Both terrorism and economic security are concern.</comment>

<comment>Taking these figures into account, a rough calculation suggests that in the last five years, your chances of being killed by a terrorist are about one in 20 million. This compares the annual risk of dying in a car accident of 1 in 19,000; drowning in a bathtub at 1 in 800,000; dying in a building fire at 1 in 99,000; or being struck by lightning at 1 in 5,500,00. In other words, in the last five years you were four times more likely to be struck by lightning than killed by a terrorist.https://reason.com/archives/20...http://www.theatlantic.com/int...Terrorism is an exaggerated threat to us and is used in fear mongering to support perpetual warfare and the erosion of our rights. If you paid attention lately, you would know that the Patriot Act did not help stop a terrorist attack, but violated the Fourth Amendment and threatens the First Amendment by taking away our privacy which facilitates the right of free association, speech, and the right to petition the government. If we wanted to stop terrorism, we would quit selling arms to both sides of conflicts over the past 20 years and hold Saudi Arabia responsible.</comment>

<comment>Brilliant, you sum it up perfectly. Be my friend.</comment>

<comment>The body count from terrorists is a poor way to measure the risk.It's the friction and cost involved to manage the risk, unless you are OK with bombs going off at the Mall of America and on 767s.</comment>

<comment>Exactly John, that's the point. The risk is managed, or we would be seeing a lot more attacks presumably. Therefore, since what we are doing is working, why is the fear of it a huge political crisis? Because fear is a huge motivator and people know this, regardless of how illogical the fear is.</comment>

<comment>We are not managing the risk at all. We are actually inciting and exacerbating it for resource control and geopolitical positioning against Russia. Our regime change and arms deals have increased the risks of terrorist and costs us trillions of dollars. In the 50s, we (the CIA) overthrew a democratically elected prime minister and replaced him with the Shah. After that, Iran had an Islamic revolution and went from secular to a more extreme religious government. In Afghanistan in the 80s, the CIA trained the first Al Qaida operatives including Bin Laden and gave weapons to the Afghans to fight Russia in a proxy war. We also helped to install Saddam Hussein in Iraq. When he did not want to cooperate with us we toppled him on false pretenses even though 9-11 was committed by Saudis, our staunch ally who helps fund terrorism, is in the Islamic extreme Wahhabism, and does not help to fight ISIS in Syria. The void left in Iraq was swallowed by extremists because we allowed a vacuum and support a certain sect of Islam over the other and the others joined ISIS. We gave arms to those Iraqis and the arms were taken by ISIS. We gave weapons directly to ISIS to fight Assad. Give me a break. We have done nothing to manage terrorism. All we have ever promoted is instability.</comment>

<comment>Listen bub I'm not interested in getting into a debate about the existential causes of terrorism. I'd probably largely agree with you.But the best way to debate people is to accept their premises and then drive them off their position within those premises, IMO. I've spoken with John alot and know his position is the common US conservative one: that regardless of terrorists motivation, terrorists are responsible for their actions and must be confronted and its "crazy" to do nothing about it. They use that position to support fear mongering. Accepting that we have a terrorism problem now, (regardless of why), I argued that the lack of attacks is evidence that our means employed to suppress those attacks is working, and that therefore the fear mongering is misplaced. Ya dig?</comment>

<comment>My point is we have been spending vast sums of money while increasing the threat of terrorism and eroding freedoms here at home. That is not managing risk plain and simple. You also cannot remove causation and context from the conversation. History is to be learned from so we can make the best use of our risk management even if that involves accepting hard truths about ourselves. Besides there was never a great risk in the first place that we mitigated with our efforts. We have only increased the risk. There is no evidence that we have suppressed attacks. None, the NSA cannot name a single case. In fact, for all of the surveillance, they couldn't even get the Boston bombing despite being warned by foreign intelligence.Maybe you would agree, maybe you wouldn't.</comment>

<comment>"You also cannot remove causation and context from the conversation."That's exactly the conservative approach to the issue though. So if you can accept that premise for the sake of the conversation and still show that their position is wrong, then you are going to have a much stronger argument.I would suggest that you are a little too eager to find disagreement too. Though I do disagree with you that the increased security measures since 9-11 have had no effect. Hard to quantify plans that were never even started because people know, for instance, that we increased security at air ports. Also there's the argument that by forcing the conflict to the Middle East, those that would do harm here are preoccupied. I agree that is flawed thinking because its probably creating more discontent then anything else (thus fueling terrorist motivation), but again a lot of conservatives think that the motivation is irrelevant, so that arguments not going to hold a lot of water with them.I prefer to try and engage with the people that don't already agree with me on their level. Else-wise you just end up with a self-reinforcing closed information loop. </comment>

<comment>Maybe in terms of connecting with people, but the stronger argument is in facts. I lay factual information and I will let the other people judge who's side is better debated.</comment>

<comment>N.A.S.A. STS-75 mission, "cable tether incident," when calculated the one inch steel cable was generating enough electricity to power the entire planet for three days every hour.Metal absorbs cosmic radiation until it goes plasmic when in outer space. Unlimited electricity, limitless heat.</comment>

<comment>I am not really sure what that has to do with this conversation, but I am not sure if that would work or not. Being an engineer, I am thinking about the stresses of the cable which reaches out into/past the ionosphere. Maybe you are trying to connect the fact that energy independence frees us from the need to be involved in the Middle East and provides a National Security we do not have now.</comment>

<comment>No, clearly I believe that we must invest in wind power since that's replacing oil so quickly...</comment>

<comment>Just seemed odd and non-sequitur... possibly with intent to make the thread look cookey. I am all for energy independence though, just don't understand the purpose in this thread.</comment>

<comment>Not only that it worked for the Republicans in 2014.  Ebola was sensationalized even though anyone who knew public health realized that it was under control in this country.  I remember posts which expressed the fear that Ebola victims would come over the unguarded Mexican border and infect us all.  It's probably a coincidence that the Ebola scare died down after the election.  Now we have terrorism which as Shayne pointed out is an unrealistic fear.  Yet the Republican Presidential candidates with one or two possible exceptions are claiming that terrorism is a major threat to this country to which many of them add it's Obama's fault for not doing more to fight ISIS.  Already many in the public are expressing apprehension about going into public places because of terrorists.  In the past we could be assured that we had nothing to fear but fear itself but today fear works.</comment>

<comment>Right now terrorists are killing Americans at close to the same rate per year as spiders.</comment>

<comment>And, as Bernie said on Larry Wilmore last night, he and the American people are smart enough to chew gum and walk at the same time. He said destroying ISIS doesn't mean we have to take our eye off of the need to rebuild the middle class and many other things.</comment>

<comment>If you are actually worried about terrorism, you're an idiot.</comment>

<comment>It is Bernie or Hillary, or the forces of darkness.  The GOP has really become the dark side of the Force.  Sane GOP candidates don't even fog the mirror.  The insane ones do nothing but fearmongering.  More Americans died from dead batteries in their pacemakers in 2015, than died at the hands of ISIS.</comment>

<comment>So, you like Hillary.</comment>

<comment>I am not feeding trolls any more, John.</comment>

<comment>Best set your account to private. You've got a long and suspicious history of getting votes from what I'm pretty sure are your sock puppets. But not today, no Esther or Anita... hmmm..Maybe you should come clean?Ok, I'll go first. I'm a 59 year old man living in an upscale suburb of a large Oregon city (there's really only one). I make ~50k/yr., wife makes ~50k. I have two adult step kids, own 70% equity in a 500k house, two cars, and a cute little doggy. Well, to be honest, he owns us.  I vote dem, but am centrist enough to be alarmed by the pretty severe left tack that is now going on in the party. I have three disqus accounts. You?Edit: Liked your OP here BTW.</comment>

<comment>From Bernie Sanders' Wall St speech:It is no secret that millions of Americans have become disillusioned with our political process. They don’t vote. They don’t believe much of what comes out of Washington. They don’t think anyone is there representing their interests. In my view, one of the reasons for that deep disillusionment is the widespread understanding that our criminal justice system is broken and grossly unfair – and that we do not have equal justice under the law. The average American sees kids being arrested and sometimes even jailed for possessing marijuana or other minor crimes. But when it comes to Wall Street executives, some of the wealthiest and most powerful people in this country, whose illegal behavior caused pain and suffering for millions – somehow nothing happens to them. No police record. No jail time. No justice.We live in a country today that has an economy that is rigged, a campaign finance system which is corrupt and a criminal justice system which, too often, does not dispense justice.Not one major Wall Street executive has been prosecuted for causing the near collapse of our entire economy.That will change under my administration. “Equal Justice Under Law” will not just be words engraved on the entrance of the Supreme Court. It will be the standard that applies to Wall Street and all America.</comment>

<comment>Ever wonder why Obama and Holder didn't prosecute anyone?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>"Democrats love Wall Street. " Only since Bill Clinton - his 1996 re-election campaign made history because it was the first time that the Democrat received more campaign donations from Corporate America than the GOP candidate did.But then, that was the whole raison d'être of the DLC.</comment>

<comment>Think a bit more about why both parties "love Wall Street." Baby Boomers are retiring. Most expect to fund at least a major portion of their retirement with 401k and other retirement funds that are invested on Wall Street. Even pension funds are invested. Ask an adult what impact the last few days of market declines have had on their portfolio. Now ask them if they want someone like Bernie to drop that DOW another 400 points. Bernie is trying to make up for that by promising to increase social security benefits (by taxing young people more- taxing the rich won't pay for his plan). Eliminating the savings of those near retirement and screwing the young to partially compensate for it is neither a coherent economic policy nor a pathway to electoral success.</comment>

<comment>"The Holder Doctrine" was developed under Clinton when Holder was Deputy AG in 1999. It basically said hands off any financial execs because their incarceration could cause problems for ordinary folk.</comment>

<comment>Thank You for the info!http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/g...</comment>

<comment>Probably because it would have made poker night over at Geithner's house really awkward.</comment>

<comment>Holder is a partner in the criminal defense firm retained as outside counsel for Goldman Sachs. In fact, he is their lawyer as has been reported in the press.</comment>

<comment>Did you hear the latest?If police can find a group of three or more African Americans together and one of them is in possession of more than one packaged amount of crack ALL of them are charged with conspiracy to sell and deliver which is a mandatory five years in prison first offense with no record unless the others willingly testify against the one holding.Can you imagine police at a Manhattan high-rise party doing that to investment bankers?</comment>

<comment>That's because Eric Holder worked for the law firm he went back to that did the bailouts.</comment>

<comment>For those actually interested in the new proposals that Bernie Sanders outlined in his speech, here's a link to the full text:http://www.marketwatch.com/sto...</comment>

<comment>This is why Americans should vote for Sanders.Ultimately, everything else is a secondary issue compared to this - does America live in a plutocracy where Wall Street does whatever it wants, or does society choose to live in a place where the big banks have limits to their power?The other question is, do people want to vote for a society where the rich have everything, while most struggle to get by, or do they want a Nordic Social Democracy? Clinton will give the former, as will most Republicans, having being long bought for by the big banks in their campaign contributions. Sanders will take the first steps (if he can overcome Congress) in the later.I think I understand why the American mainstream media has censored Sanders largely and blacked out his campaign. They fear him, and what he stands for.A lot of people are angry, very angry at the big banks. This is for good reason - the very nature of justice in America has been destroyed by incidents like this, as has the basic social contract of society due to rising inequality.I think that there is a lot more support than this article implies. Perhaps the mainstream media fears the truth, or the very wealthy do, anyways? </comment>

<comment>I like your comment, but let me add some thoughts.Our most primary concern is campaign finance and lobbying in this country. Citizens United and corporate personhood giving them the rights to free speech (equaling money) and the ability for corporate interests to lobby with money not only advocating, but actually writing legislation which goes in front of congress is a prerequisite to pretty much every other major issue in this country.You will find this is the source of the crony capitalism we face and what is helping to build the fascistic movement and oligarchy. This is why it was possible for Glass-Stegall to be removed, why no bankers went to jail for fraud, why only milquetoast wall street reforms have occurred, and why the banks have been allowed to grow even after the bailout. Without fixing the primary issue and codifying it into law as an amendment, even if we achieve temporary victory, it can be easily undone. Of course this issue is also the cause of corporate subsidies and low effective tax rates for corporations and the wealthy, of the perpetual warfare and arms deals, of the trade agreements, even of welfare of the poor as this is an indirect way to subsidize the labor of corporations.This primary issue is quintessential to preserving our republic. Without it we have no representation and moral and ethics go out the window. If we cannot fix it, it will eventually get bad enough that we will scream "no taxation without representation" once again and throw the proverbial tea in the river.</comment>

<comment>Money is over-rated.  Jeb Bush raised lots of it.</comment>

<comment>You are spamming this thread with nonsense. Your posts look like the typical paid comments to derail conversation. No substance; just sound bites.Money is so overrated that these corporations pour millions into lobbying and campaign contributions. They do it out of care for our political process (sarcasm). They have gotten a big return on their investments. Jeb Bush may be failing, but that's why they donate to campaigns to multiple candidates on both sides. They hedge their bets to ensure the party vetting process ensures a corporate candidate. Mac on that.</comment>

<comment>No, he's right.Look at Rubio, all of the establishment money but his ground game is so weak that Ted Cruz is beating him.You're right that money is important but all the money in the world can't save a bad candidate.</comment>

Lack of money matters even more and the share of that money in campaign contributions vs. SuperPACs along with the average donation amount is a key indicator of more broad public support.Nobody even knows who Jill Stein (3rd Party) is because of her lack of funds and coverage ($217,351) although she would be a much better, or at least honest and having integrity, president than almost everyone else running.ClintonTotal - $    98,363,283.00 527 - $-   Campaign - $77,471,604.00 Carey - $4,615,691.00 Super PAC - $16,275,988.00 % from Campaign = 79.0%Average Donation - won't disclose, but many of her fundraisers are the max $2,700 at the door.SandersTotal - $41,488,828.00 Campaign - $41,463,784.00 Leadership PAC - $16,249.00 Super PAC - $8,795.00% from Campaign = 99.9%Average Donation = $30There are various factors which affect a campaign and the polls, but the statement I said is completely true. Establishment money hedges their bets on both sides to ensure the party vetting process produces a corporate candidate. That is why Bernie Sanders get a media blackout and why the DNC does not want him to be the nominee. 99.9% campaign funded and average donation of $30 (i.e. funded by the people, for the people)</comment>

<comment>If you want a financial meltdown that will make 1987 and 2008 to look like blips on the radar.   let Bernie have his way with Wall Street.</comment>

<comment>Good thing then that taxpayers own the Fed and can print unlimited money to lend to the poor and middle class while Wall Street goes belly-up!</comment>

<comment>One doesn't have to believe in a "Nordic Social Democracy" to hold Wall Street accountable.Freshwater economists (Cato Institute types) thought that TARP was a terrible idea.</comment>

<comment>I don't think the whole aim of this speech was to gain every undecided voter. This seems to me as a speech with the goal to re-energize and motivate his current voters while possibly garnering some new ones. We are approaching the Iowa and NH caucuses, mobilizing your voters is a necessity in order to win... so don't act like it was a fruitless venture.Not to mention, Bernie also put forth several new courses of action that he has planned for decreasing the gap between fraudulent Wall Street and the hardworking middle class.I've seen Hillary and the GOP get more praise from less specific and less effective work. Your bias is duly noted.</comment>

<comment>First of all - I should be clear that I am a Trump supporter.That said - there are some key points about Bernie that make him 1000 times more attractive than Hillary Clinton  ( who I consider to be the absolute worst-case scenario as POTUS ) .It boils down to his support for average workers and his 100% opposition to Wall Street - which are obviously interrelated issues, two sides of the same coin.Bernie has been a long-term opponent of H1-B visas and investment bank bailouts- the Clintons have scooped up 75 million in speaking fees alone from big corporations and Wall Street.The sad thing to me personally, is that Bernie is heavily boxed in by the SJWs who form his base. Which means that he has to oppose deportation of illegals-  even though he knows that illegal and mass immigration hurts ordinary workers.  His progressive base are economic illiterates, and that is not going to change any time soon.Also, he is a prisoner of progressive racial politics - affirmative action, apologizing to Black Lives Matter, etc. etc. etc.It's really a shame that Bernie is going to lose the primaries and tell his supporters to go vote for Hillary.</comment>

<comment>You give SJW too much power for no reason like 99% of conservatives.Racial politics is a thing used by every politician in the US, you're a Trump supporter, you know this.Bernie really shouldn't win because he never was designed to win, he just wants to shift the DNC's conversation and he is succeeding. The younger generation realizes that government isn't inherently juxtaposed to growth and success, that the free market being seen as a deity has done nothing but enrich the wealthy, that the US isn't the greatest country in the world by numerous measures and that democratic socialism can work.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately Bernie is an economic illiterate.We already have one of the worst corporate tax codes in the world.$50/hour jobs for turning a wrench aren't coming back.And - you and I won't be richer if JP Morgan can't underwrite debt or equity deals.</comment>

<comment>That's why Bernie wants to basically rewrite the tax codeAnd when did he say he want's "$50/hour jobs for turning a wrench"?And you will be richer is he regulates Wall Street, first, there won't be an economic collapse, so you won't lose your money. Second, banks like JP Morgan won't be able to rip you off by charging outrageously high interest rates...</comment>

<comment>Taxing stock trades moves trading and high pay financial sector jobs to markets like London.Raising already high corporate taxes moves corporate jobs to any other 1st world country. Promoting high cost union jobs moves manufacturing jobs to places like Mexico or causes people to flee states like IL. </comment>

<comment>I dunno. There's a reason Silicon Valley stays in Silicon Valley and Wall Street stays on Wall Street instead of moving to, say, the Isle of Jersey. People like where they live.</comment>

<comment>London is already the #1 or #2 global center of finance.  It ain't Yuma, AZ.And - it's really easy to have multiple listings for a stock.</comment>

<comment>My guess is that you have no idea whatsoever as to the details of the corporate tax loophole closing legislation he introduced in April........or that he said on Charlie Rose a few months ago that he would not be 100% against lowering the 35% corporate tax rate as long as there would still be substantial extra tax revenue raised when done in combination with closing the loopholes.</comment>

<comment>More tax revenue from corporations = higher effective corporate tax rates.</comment>

<comment>That's good with me. Why should they pay an effect tax rate lower than middle class Americans?</comment>

<comment>Right. The effective rate paid in federal corporate income tax last year was about 19% (about $420 billion on $2.1 trillion).....well below the 27% or so average effective rate paid by the 30 OECD countries. Some sources will say the U.S. effective rate paid was 28% but they are counting foreign taxes paid (which are deductible from U.S. federal corporate taxes owed), deferred taxes not paid on foreign earnings, and state corporate income taxes paid (which are also deductible from federal corporate income taxes owed).The multinationals that would be seeing their loopholes closed are, on average, paying well below that 19%. Companies like Walmart who are already paying, effectively, about 32% would not be affected.</comment>

<comment>Companies like CVS that have no NOLs and earn their profits here pay an effective rate of 35%+.And - we are one of the few countries that taxes overseas earnings. It's the reason companies like AAPL are incentivized to stash cash overseas.</comment>

<comment>Most countries really use a hybrid between a worldwide and a territorial tax system for......many are moving toward our mostly worldwide system as they see they are losing too much revenue. Not sure what a NOL is, but yes, as I said, many pay very close to 35% and would not be affected by the loophole closures..</comment>

<comment>He can't stress it too much publicly now because of how it would be misrepresented in the media, but he has long called for much stricter enforcement of the laws against the employers of undocumented workers (the ending of the jobs magnet).The legislation he has proposed to drastically reduce the number of H1B and other work visas is actually more important since that is the real source of jobs competition. Net immigration from Mexico (both legal and illegal) is actually close to zero since 2009.........but that could change if real employment here ever improves.</comment>

<comment>"...since that is the real source of jobs competition...".You are only partially correct. H1-Bs are a problem for white-collar jobs.But illegal immigrants are a problem for working class jobs - for some reason, you fail to see that.</comment>

<comment>By "other work visas" I meant lower paying jobs and by ending the jobs magnet I meant those too.</comment>

<comment>" The crowd erupted into cheers.  Bernie, Bernie Bernie.  What remains unclear is whether that  the strength of that appeal will be enough."Enough is enough.</comment>

<comment>Why don't they cover how bored everybody is at Hillary Clinton's events? More signs than supporters at some, people carry posts holding 3+ signs. Pitiful.</comment>

<comment>     The collective American Citizen loans banker's money at the rate of .25% through the Fed.Those same banker's now sell the money back to the American Citizen at the rate of 3.25% to  29.99% pocketing the profits from the access to cheap capital from the collective American Citizen through the Fed.This is the same exact money of the collective American Citizen being loaned back to the American Citizen through the Banker's.The American Citizen should be able to get loans directly from the Fed at the rate .25%The Government Accountability Office should audit every dollar ever spent by the federal government including the Fed.The Government Accountability Office should audit every dollar ever spent or received by any political candidates or organizations.</comment>

<comment>here's another happy detail -- after borrowing the cheap money, the banks park it w/ the Fed as an offshore entity and receive tax-free interest on it....</comment>

<comment>Bernie means well and I admire him for being principled.But trying to help the economy and working people by putting more layers of government atop Wall Street is like trying to put out a forest fire by spraying it with gasoline.Wall Street IS government, Bernie. That's precisely the problem.</comment>

<comment>Regulation is what we need.For example, only in the US do we think its a good idea to speculate on derivatives, a tool the financial industry admits no one understands and China and Germany has already banned them.</comment>

<comment>An interest rate swap is a "derivative."So is hedging out contracts for things like oil or wheat.So is hedging ForEx risk.So is buying a put on a stock.Which of these would you ban?</comment>

<comment>Why would you want to waste your time talking to a financial illiterate?Anyhow - banning any kind of financial tools is just stupidity.Intelligent people support the free market - meaning ONLY government regulation for finance that deals directly with average people.So, for example - we need FDIC backstop for our personal bank accounts.  Therefore, FDIC-insured banks must follow certain regulations to protect the public.On the other hand  - if Goldman Sachs and Chase want to have some complex deal involving derivatives - they are big boys - and should assume all risks - CAVEAT EMPTOR.It should not be the job of the government to regulate NOR TO BAILOUT the loser of that casino bet.If a dispute arises - they can always sue each other in a court of law.</comment>

<comment>yeah except we saw how the NOT bailing out bit when the gamble fell through worked out. where do you think that money came from?</comment>

<comment>Well part of a 21st century Glass-Stegall is adding back the divisions between the consumer (average people) banking and loans and the higher risk speculation style trading so when they make bad investments, they can fail and we don't have to bail them out in the fear that the consumer side will fall with it. Glass-Stegall is like putting bays in a freighter or large ship so when a leak springs in one bay, it can be sealed off and fixed rather than taking down the entire ship. A free market could then work, but without Glass-Stegall we have socialism for the rich (bailout with tax payers money or we all suffer a loss due to a concentrated few). Most of the regulations being proposed are more about preventing fraudulent activity through transparency of ratings and accountability through not having a conflict of interest at the FED.</comment>

<comment>You really don't get it.  You believe in "too big to fail". You think that the government "needs" to bail out a large investment bank in trouble, because otherwise the failure of that firm would endanger the whole economy.TBTF is bogus propaganda. When Paulson and Bernanke did that song-and-dance in 2008 to snowjob a gullible public - people like you lapped it right up.</comment>

<comment>Actually, no I don't believe in it because many economists were against it. Many sought to let them go into bankruptcy instead and their profitable assets bought. I would have much rather them revalued the assets and adjusted the loans on the mortgages to match the realistic values and then if a stimulus was absolutely needed, give it to the home owners as mortgage vouchers so the tax payers who were going to stimulate the system would actually see some benefit.All I was saying is that not having Glass-Stegall in place made the fear-mongering rhetoric easier to pass on the public in fear that they would lose everything if they didn't do the bailout.Look at this letter signed by many economist in 2008:http://freakonomics.com/2008/0...</comment>

<comment>"...All I was saying is that not having Glass-Stegall in place made the fear-mongering rhetoric easier to pass on the public in fear that they would lose everything if they didn't do the bailout....".That was not so much a function of Glass-Steagall repeal - more of a function that the average person does not know the difference between a savings bank, a commecial bank and an investment bank.They heard that a "bank"  ( Lehman Brothers, for example ) went insolvent - so they think that the ATM at their local bank will stop giving out cash - because fearmongers like Paulson and Bernanke were on TV saying "Everything is interconnected!".</comment>

<comment>Well the fact is everything had become more interconnected due to the repeal of Glass-Steagall, but that doesn't mean we had to hand Wall Street a blank check and incentivize the fraudulent behavior which caused the crash. We can both agree that most people are ignorant of the issues and the bailout was not best solution.</comment>

<comment>the way the chanting crowd completed the line for him...</comment>

<comment>Removing the government layers that FDR added is precisely what lead to the crash in 2008</comment>

<comment>Government being able to shut down bad employers and cheats = public service</comment>

<comment>I'm a former bank VP, btw, (very big bank that has paid big fines). I've always stood for responsibility, transparency, lawful conduct, ethics. Theoretically, it's possible to run a perfectly clean bank, you just have to hire & fire correctly.</comment>

<comment>I admire Bernie for being consistent and principled.Unfortunately, he is an economic illiterate.  This isn't 1952.</comment>

<comment>It isn't 2015 either, "This isn't 1952"  isn't an argument</comment>

<comment>Ok then how about IF by some miracle he were to get elected  he would never get ANY of his pet projects passed by Congress.The guy is just blowing smoke.</comment>

<comment>Well if a new invigorated public stays involved beyond the presidential election, the incumbents can be thrown out and a new congress put in its place. A defeatist attitude will only get you defeat. That is not for me. I am tired of being on the sidelines.</comment>

<comment>Sorry shayne but realism is not defeatism.</comment>

<comment>I am sure the founding fathers were being realist when they decided to take a stand against the greatest empire on the earth at the time too. Sometimes you have to have standards to fight for rather than accepting things will never change.</comment>

<comment>Let's raise the highest corporate tax rate in the world even higher!Let's promote more high cost, low value add union jobs!</comment>

<comment>Some would disagree with that first statement. We're not much above average when you look at effective rates.http://www.forbes.com/sites/ta...</comment>

<comment>You need to look at the effective rate amigo, we're in the middle.Its like the 1950's "90% tax rate", yes it was a thing on paper but the wealthiest Americans paid around 40%-45% maximum.</comment>

<comment>You missed the point of the speech. Bernie needs to contrast himself with Clinton on Wall Street reform, an area where she is weak, being widely seen as being too closely tied top Wall Street and the Financial Services Industry.This speech served two purposes:1. To give some granularity, clarity and specificity to his heretofore general calls for reform, and2. To clearly define the difference between himself and Clinton.He attained both these goals beautifully.</comment>

<comment>But Sanders lacks the balls to directly call the Clintons out as Wall Street puppets.That makes him look scared of the Clintons and weak.</comment>

<comment>If you had listed to the speech, you would know he directly went after her on a few things.Excerpts from his speech:Now, my opponent, Secretary Clinton says that Glass-Steagall would not have prevented the financial crisis because shadow banks like AIG and Lehman Brothers, not big commercial banks, were the real culprits.Secretary Clinton is wrong.Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act.Secretary Clinton says we just need to impose a few more fees and regulations on the financial industry. I disagree.As former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has said and I quote: “Giant Wall Street banks continue to threaten the wellbeing of millions of Americans, but what to do? Bernie Sanders says break them up and resurrect the Glass-Steagall Act that once separated investment from commercial banking. Hillary Clinton says charge them a bit more and oversee them more carefully … Hillary Clinton’s proposals would only invite more dilution and finagle. The only way to contain the Street’s excesses is with reforms so big, bold, and public they can’t be watered down – busting up the biggest banks and resurrecting Glass-Steagall.”Secretary Reich is right. Real Wall Street reform means breaking up the big banks and re-establishing firewalls that separates risk taking from traditional banking.My opponent says that, as a senator, she told bankers to “cut it out” and end their destructive behavior. But, in my view, establishment politicians are the ones who need to “cut it out.” The reality is that Congress doesn’t regulate Wall Street. Wall Street, its lobbyists and their billions of dollars regulate Congress. We must change that reality, and as president I will.Read it here:http://www.marketwatch.com/sto...Watch it here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Glass Steagall would not have prevented AIG, G-S, Bear, Lehman and Merrill from failing.Only one traditional bank failed - Wachovia.  And - that was a good old fashioned, poorly-timed bet on CA real estate - which has nothing to do with G-S.Bernie is an economic illiterate.</comment>

<comment>Although not the proximate cause of the financial crisis, the repeal of Glass Steagall made the financial crisis worse than it would have been. The banks merged into more complex and more leveraged institutions. They were the customers of AIG, Bear Sterns, Lehman Bros., etc.and contributed to these firms bulking up on their holdings of sub-prime mortgages.Bernie knows this. He never said that the repeal of Glass Steagall caused the financial crisis but only that it was a contributor to its severity. He also never said that breaking up the big banks alone will prevent another crisis.......he knows other things need to be done too to lessen that probability and/or lessen its severity should that occur.</comment>

<comment>Glass Steagall repeal was a mistake - agreed. But it is silly to put so much emphasis on it relative to the events of 2008.Glass-Steagall prevented commercial banks from doing investment banking.  Robert Rubin, Clinton's secretary of the Treasury pushed for the repeal together with both democrat and  Republican allies in Congress such as Senator Phil Gramm.Rubin left office to become Citigroup CEO. Not coincidentally, Citigroup was a commercial bank which wanted to do investment banking.But looking at something like the AIG situation - that had NOTHING to do with Glass-Steagall.   There were so many other issues - people focus on Glass-Steagall because it is an easy name to remember.</comment>

<comment>From his speech:"Shadow banks did gamble recklessly, but where did that money come from? It came from the federally-insured bank deposits of big commercial banks – something that would have been banned under the Glass-Steagall Act."Other economist agree with this assertion. But there is also no reason not to bring back a modern version of Glass-Steagall which also deals with some of the shadow banking you are talking about. Some of the proposals I like best about the speech is eliminating the conflict of interests in the FED by eliminating the appoint members of the committee who are Wall Street insiders (one does not have to have been a past CEO of Goldman-Sachs to have expertise in the FEDs mandate) and the non-profit rating agencies. Also, I sincerely believe has Glass-Steagall been in place the threat to our economy would have been lessened by the partitions and may have prevented the rhetoric for the bailout.</comment>

<comment>I think it would be very instructive for you, for example, to actually go through the series of events that occurred with the AIG crisis - and ask yourself how exactly Glass-Steagall would have stopped AIG from its behavior or prevented the bailouts.I think you will find it not relevant.The crisis of 2008 had many moving parts. Glass Steagall repeal was only one of dozens of issues.</comment>

<comment>I will definitely do that. Thank you for not being like JohnJMac on this thread. You sincerely seem to have differences in opinion and a genuine interest in conversation. Aside from Glass-Steagall, what do you think about the proposals on the FED and Rating Agencies?</comment>

<comment>Clearly, it would help to appoint Fed members who are serving in the public interest instead of the invesment banks' interest.You may have noticed that Bush and Obama were put into office with investment bank cash.Also, the Fed is too powerful - they have the discretion to create money and put it right into the accounts of big investment banks - they did a lot of that in 2008.   Rand Paul also talks a lot about the power of the Fed, but nobody cares.The rating agencies?  There needs to be LESS government regulation of the rating agencies.  These firms are real scumbags ( S + P, Moodys, etc.)They produced fake ratings on derivatives in the lead-up to 2008. But that is OK - now the world knows not to trust them. That is the free market.The problem is that if YOU want to set up your own rating agency - the government will roadblock you - this is crony capitalism - favoritism towards the crooks ( S + P, Moodys).</comment>

<comment>I rail against crony capitalism all the time. I was a Ron Paul supporter in 2008, but the RNC shut him out just as they are trying to shut Bernie out. I don't believe they will give Rand a chance either. He is the best choice out of the republicans if you ask me. I am very libertarian especially on social issues. The left and the right want to tell people what to do with their lives. Thank God the Founding Fathers knew not to set this country us as a pure democracy or we would be an ebb and flow from religious fanaticism and politically incorrect do not offend me police. On the economic side of Libertarianism I find myself at conflict with some things. The main things being:- I don't think a truly free market has and will ever exist allowing us to operate under real laissez-faire capitalism; However, it is an ideal to aspire close to. We should be rid of subsidies, unfair tax practices, fractional reserve banking and currency manipulation, possibly even get rid of the fiat currency itself.- I am not anarchist and I believe government can act in the public interest through proper regulation, but not the crony kind we see today. I am not for corporations as people, and money as free speech. I see much of this as the cause for the crony capitalism, but I do understand that the bigger the government involvement in the various industries and life in general increases the incentive for the government to be a medium for these actions to take place; however, I do feel that if there is an imbalance in place (wealth inequality and power inequity), even in the anarchist situation and purely free market, powerful players would come together in collusion rather than competition to own the means to production and take away a man's ownership of himself and the fruits of his labor. That in itself would remove the freedom of the market even without the government's arm acting. The government should be primarily focused on fraud and preserving the property rights of the individual against other individuals and of the commons. The federal government should protect states' rights and judge on interstate conflict. They also should provide common defense and promote general welfare (however, this is a hard one to define). I think the EPA, FDA, and some of the other agencies are needed to protect those rights and the commons, but they have become seriously corrupt.- Lastly, I believe education is a necessity to a social and civil life. The same goes with healthcare. These commodities can never be traded in and regulated by a free market system. Free markets have a basis in choice and free association. Choosing to die or suffer in pain rather than get healthcare or choosing to be in poverty by ignorance and lack of skills rather than getting education are not true choices at all. These commodities should not be viewed through the context of pure capitalism.Anyway, just some of my thoughts.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't attack Hillary because he doesn't want to, he wants a clean campaign, winning on the issues not personal attacks</comment>

<comment>You sound very naive.  Pointing out the truth of the Wall Street- Clintons connection is not dirty - it is exactly what the public needs.</comment>

<comment>If you watched the last debate, you would have heard Sanders telling Clinton to her face that she is backed by and beholden to Wall Street and that Wall St. loves her, unlike himself.He doesn't stoop to name-calling (calling them Wall st. puppets??), so if that's what it takes to 'look' strong to you....well, consider him weak.</comment>

<comment>I did watch it and I don't think he said what you think he said.</comment>

<comment>Your memory must be slipping then. From the second democratic debate (point #3):http://www.politico.com/story/..."Both Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley tore into Clinton over the support she enjoys from Wall Street donors. Her explanation—that she has a record of pushing reforms on financial institutions, and has a tough plan to further rein in Wall Street, so her donors know what they’re getting into—is “not good enough,” Sanders said.“Why, over her political career, has Wall Street been…the major campaign contributor” to Clinton, Sanders asked. “Maybe they’re dumb, they don’t know what they’re going to get, but I don’t think so.”And from the transcript of the 3rd debate:http://www.cbsnews.com/news/de..."Secretary Clinton, I don't have a super PAC. I don't get any money from Wall Street. You have gotten a whole lot of money over the years from Wall Street. But most importantly, when you look at what happened in the 1990s, go to berniesanders.com.""MUIR: Secretary, thank you. Senator Sanders...(APPLAUSE)I want to stay on this and ask you how big a role does corporate America play in a healthy economy and will corporate America love a President Sanders?SANDERS: No, I think they won't.(LAUGHTER)(APPLAUSE)So Hillary and I have a difference. The CEOs of large multinationals may like Hillary. They ain't going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.(APPLAUSE)"</comment>

<comment>3. To get MSM attention at this time. That's working beautifully, too.</comment>

<comment>The problem with Sanders is this; he talks a good game as far as reform. But he doesn't have enough like-minded legislators in Congress to implement his reform. You don't get banking or campaign finance reform just because you are the president.There is a real question as to if Bernie can get legislative support for his proposals.</comment>

<comment>Yawn. The Street vs. The Bern will not be a headlining fight event anytime soon.</comment>

<comment>As long as my dividend increases are okay, I don't actually care about this story. But I realize there's an "if" here.</comment>

<comment>Just to be safe, start moving out of your bank, insurance and multinational stocks and into domestic manufacturing and retail stocks :-)</comment>

<comment>Sanders and his supporters are just the flip side of Trump and his supporters - angry conspiracy theorists.</comment>

<comment>there is solid macroeconomic support for the proposition that the increasing concentration of wealth is bad for the economy. unfortunately, there are too many people like yourself who don't understand economics at a time when greater understanding of economics is needed. the republican attack on public education has achieved its goal of dumbing down society; and a dumbed down people are easier to manipulate.</comment>

<comment>Wrong, I'm not angry and I'm not a theorist. The conspiracy is an open secret its just that you haven't put the pieces together yet like Donald Trump and myself along with about 200 million other Americans. You might want to catch up.</comment>

<comment>I have a theory. We will have an economic meltdown due to the real estate bubble brewing...oh, yeah, that happened already. I have a theory. U.S. corporations will buy or merge with international businesses to avoid paying their taxes...oh, wait, that is happening already. I have a theory. Health insurance will continue to rise in cost and be unaffordable for individuals and businesses...oh wait, that is already happening. We need somebody who will fight against the inequalities due to corporations not serving their employees and communities as well as their shareholders.</comment>

<comment>What conspiracy? Bernie's citing hard numbers and cold facts.</comment>

<comment>Bernie is saying all the right things and majority of Democrats and maybe a few others agree with him on Wall Street. He's also right about Citizens United but those seem to be the main issues he talks about but there are other issues like foreign policy which is important that Hillary has far more knowledge about. So as great as Bernie is and I wish him all the best, at the end of day he will not be the nominee that will be Hillary. When being interviewed her knowledge of all things far outweighs Bernie's plus she looks presidential to boot. So as much as I love Bernie the man I don't think he is as qualified as Hillary to become POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Typical  lefty low information voter = "plus she looks presidential"</comment>

<comment>Not only does Hillary look presidential she has the knowledge to be POTUS. Unlike her GOP opponents. All they do is talk about Hillary and President Obama. Which is what they always do when have no real solutions on anything. All of the GOP wannabee's say on their first day in office I'll do this that and the other, like they even could! Plus the fact none of them are going to get the chance to have a first day in office. That will be Hillary's day.</comment>

<comment>And what exactly will Hillary get accomplished with a Republican House and Senate?</comment>

<comment>All the more reason for Benie's supporters to make their voices heard in the primaries, so there's a real, genuine choice in the general election to drive a wave election to unseat that Republican majority. Because of gerrymandering, just "solid campaigning" isn't going to solve the problem of the GOP's stranglehold on the legislative (and judicial) branches--that will take a "wave" election that brings millions of new, younger voters to the polls for the first time.Still, because the GOP is so good at gerrymandering (their timing on their last gerrymander was excellent, coming as it did at a time when big data and computer processing power made it possible to draw districts based on where specific voters (that they know support them or don't support them) live, we basically need a massive wave to make any real difference.</comment>

<comment>Ahh the tired losing liberal lament . there is no way we could lose unless the other guys cheated and stole the election from us.BTW according to Wiki 8 of the 10 most gerrymandered districts are held by democrats.</comment>

<comment>"Ahh the tired losing liberal lament . there is no way we could lose unless the other guys cheated and stole the election from us."Please cite where I said that.What I said was that a merely "campaigning well" won't be enough to unseat the GOP's colon block in congress, that a wave election that overcomes their (legal but disgusting) gerrymandering schemes in the majority of congressional districts.You might have a serious reading comprehension program--no part of that implies that "we'll only lose if the other guy cheats." Check out "Hooked on Phonics."</comment>

<comment>After you check out "Sore losers"</comment>

<comment>You do realize that EXTREME gerrymandering is not a positive for the party that holds that district, right?The whole point of gerrymandering is to concentrate all your opponents into single districts, so that you can win MORE districts with a small majority.Saying that the Dems have the most extremely gerrymandered districts is equivalent of saying the GOP has effectively titled the table.</comment>

<comment>The prevention of the agenda of the Republican House and Senate? That ain't small beans.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't be so sure about a Republican Senate if Hillary wins, she probably also takes a Democratic Senate majority along with her.</comment>

<comment>Hillary will get a lot accomplished because all the Republicans will be booted out and replaced by Democrats. Then we will get some real work done.</comment>

<comment>Like I said earlier, knowledge is worthless without wisdom, foresight and integrity.</comment>

<comment>Obama was in the same place as Sanders is at this point in the election process.  He had a double digit deficit to Hillary in 08 just like Sanders. He came from behind and trounced her.  Bernie has more grass roots support than any candidate out there just like Obama did. His individual donations far exceed any other candidate thus far.  If he was to go head to head with trump in the election he would far out perform Hillary at the voting booth. He's not bought and paid for by corporate America unlike Hillary but you can say he's bought and paid for by the people who have been shut out of democracy by Citizens United and corporate dictatorship. He's leading in New Hampshire and Iowa and when he wins these primaries, and he will, his message will be heard loud and clear that corporate America can't buy the people's will and vote.  The race is only beginning and with each primary victory people will take him more seriously and start to listen to his succinct and clear message about the demise of the middle class while the top 1% continue to make record profits that end up in Cayman Island bank accounts and not in the American citizens pockets by way of better paying jobs, benefits, financial security and taxes paid fairly to support the freedom that neocon puppets so love to tout in their hypocritical rhetoric.His interview today on Morning Joe even had conservatives agreeing with his message and intentions.  He is finally being taken seriously and people will come around quickly once the press starts to take him seriously.  He will be the only candidate who will endure the constant scrutiny that's for sure to follow.  No other will be able to hold a candle to his honesty, consistency and integrity.  This will impress people on both sides once they start to see him more.The game has only begun and I see hope for a brighter future for the people in this country who have been forgotten, forsaken and impoverished  by the corporatocracy.  The end of this tyranny will be the beginning of a new Renaissance of reason to take hold of this country and bring us forward to the level of all other great societies that listened to the people's needs and acted to fulfill them and not only the needs of the most greedy among us. </comment>

<comment>Bernie has a huge following and his message is great but regardless of all that I don't feel he will not be the nominee. Like I said Bernie may even win over conservatives for now. If he does by any remote chance become the nominee he will have a huge voting block and that will be great and I most certainly will be one of them. At the end of the day only time will tell and we will all have to wait and see what the outcome will be.</comment>

<comment>I think the whole election process needs to play out before you can make a decision.  A lot can change in a month or two.  It always does.  Who knows what new revelations will come out about any candidate?  All of these things make the politic environment extremely fluid.  I hope you are wrong and I hope you will see that.  I feel like whatever comes out Bernie Sanders will endure it all and be victorious. </comment>

<comment>Like I said we will all have to wait and see what happens whomever we like now may not end up being the nominee. Far as I'm concerned though any Democrat is far better than any Republican. The only thing they really excel at is running the country into the ground. That's what President Obama has spent the last seven years trying to put right.</comment>

<comment>She will only use all that 'knowledge' and 'presidential look' to further hers and her Wall Street/corporate backers' interests if she is elected. She is only saying all the things she is saying now to get elected. Do you really think someone as corrupt and dishonest as she is, gives two hoots about the common man?? All the knowledge and looks in the world are worthless without integrity, foresight and wisdom, none of which she possesses.At least with Bernie, you know he will try his best to keep his promises and ideas. He has fought his whole life for regular folk like you and me. He does not accept money from corporations/lobbyists/wall street, so he is beholden to no one except the American people.</comment>

<comment>This is the speech Progressives have been waiting for for 40 years.</comment>

<comment>Folks, this is the only candidate running AGAINST the Oligarchy.  IF you want more of the same, vote for Hillary or any of the rum-dumbs from the GOP.  Trump included.In my estimation, we are around 5 to 10 years past due for a switch away from supply-side economics (which has done what it set out to do...transfer wealth to the top) and back to the Keynesian policies that made the 50s and 60s so strong for the middle class.Even Bruce Bartlett, former adviser for Reagan and supply-side EXPERT, admitted as much not too long ago.It's time, folks.</comment>

<comment>Do you think we have the same kind of economy we did in the 1960s?</comment>

<comment>Of course not, it's now a global economy, driven by corporations trying to find cheap labor to keep profits high to make them attractive to investors.The decades I eluded to were when we invested in OUR PEOPLE, and not just investing in corporations and its shareholders.</comment>

<comment>I'd love to know how you think it's going to work in a global economy and one where the 401(k) has exploded making everyday folks investors. I'm not saying you're wrong that things need to change, just that Keynesian policies of the past may not yield similar results in the future.The bright spot in the sea change may be tech where many are investing in their people (certainly not all though, especially Uber).</comment>

<comment>Do you think we have the same economy we did in the '80s?</comment>

<comment>We also don't have the '86 tax code in place - the tax code got tangled again.And - marginal rates for individuals are > 28%.  </comment>

<comment>I think everyone who doesn't currently benefit from the structure -- which is most of us -- is on board with a change, and if that means changing the corporate tax structure, that's fine. I'm not wedded to "progressive tax structures uber alles, given that some of the most effective ones at implementing policies I like are mildly regressive.</comment>

<comment>Progressive > regressive.Socialism for the rich, capitalism for the rest needs to end.</comment>

<comment>Sarge - the bottom 60% of taxpayers gets more benefits from federal income taxes than they pay.And a guy who makes $25K a year pays 1/10 of the lifetime cost of his-her Medicare benefit than a guy making $250K.People have no idea how progressive our code really is. </comment>

<comment>Federally its progressive, state and local no, especially here in Texas.</comment>

<comment>That's a proven lie.</comment>

<comment>Well when your class steals all the money using fraud at the Fed AND gets bailed out when you fail in business or investing;http://www.politifact.com/trut...</comment>

<comment>Kind of sad that you think all successful people "stole all the money."How about the notion that many of those successful people are smarter than you are and worked harder?</comment>

<comment>Keep shilling for the fraudsters.</comment>

<comment>The rich are rich despite the government? You guys are delusional. By definition the rich receive more from government than they benefit. Without a government the rich wouldn't be able to make and keep millions or billions of dollars. Apart from physical and legal infrastructure, patents, military protection, regulations, contract enforcement, and stuff like that what has the government done for us?</comment>

<comment>I challenge that first sentence. One (one!) factor in the success of social democracy in Europe is its regressive tax structure (i.e. VATs).</comment>

<comment>I think we should discuss this over dinner and movie. Those VATS have significant controls bae so they don't annihilate the poor.</comment>

<comment>Sure, and they go to fund things Americans think are the mutant spawn of Stalin and Satan, so it's not like I'm comparing like things, but it's enough to challenge militant progressivism.</comment>

<comment>Militant progressivism isn't a thing outside of maybe San Francisco.</comment>

<comment>I am being rhetorical. And San Franciscans are congenitally incapable of being militant about anything.</comment>

<comment>People are mostly idiots on the subject of corporate taxes - like they are on most arcane and complicated subjects. </comment>

<comment>At least I know I can't pretend well enough to not sound like an idiot on the subject.</comment>

<comment>Bernie is obviously more comfortable talking about domestic policy than foreign policy. And as long as that's the case, Hillary will always be seen as stronger on the latter. But she isn't. What Bernie needs to do is tie Hillary's record on foreign and domestic policy together to show what so many of us already see, which is that she's nothing more than a moderate Republican running as a Democrat. The Hillary vs. Bernie debate is really a debate over what the Democratic party stands for. Are they the party of FDR or the party of Bill Clinton. If Bill or Hillary had been President in the 40s, we would have no social security. If they had been President in the 60s, we would have no Medicare. Why? Because the Clintons don't believe in progress. They, much like Obama, only believe in incremental change.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that most Democrats have been what used to be moderate Republicans since the '90s when all the moderate Republicans were raped and murdered -- metaphorically speaking -- by the Gingrichian apocalypse.</comment>

<comment>the problem with the foreign policy "hawks" is that they offer up a lot of tough talk about what other nations have to do, but the reality is that this country has decreasing influence over international events - the much of the rest of the world realizes that. the problem is that people in the US are so ignorant about the world outside of the US. that's because politicians feed an uninformed US public on the pabulum of "american exceptionalism" and that americans need only worry about what is "good for america" and the rest of the world will fall in line if we are "tough enough".for example, hillary clinton's talk of "imposing" a no-fly zone over syria on our own is completely ridiculous, and she know it. there is no way that the US could get such a resolution passed through the UN security council. chris christie claims that he would shoot down russian planes that violated a US imposed no-fly zone over syria - in reality, he would do no such thing; it's just "tough talk" for a political campaign. on this point, i must also criticize bernie sanders, because while i agree that middle eastern countries need to put some of their money into stabilizing the middle east, the reality is that those countries realize that if they don't have to do any such thing, it is not a politically tenable position (given internal partisan politics in this country) for the US to say: "well, if you won't do anything here, we won't either - see yah!". so it becomes a game of chicken in which the middle eastern countries won't do anything and will dare the US to call its bluff for inaction. the US will not call the bluff...</comment>

<comment>What I find especially hilarious is how selective the right wing is on this idea that America must lead. When it comes to fighting the war on terror, they all say America must lead instead of waiting for other countries to take action. But when it comes to climate change, the few Republicans who actually believe it will say that America shouldn't bother doing anything since countries like China and India won't either. Gee, what happened to America taking the lead on a global crisis?But I do agree that Republicans are good at talking tough. This is why Hillary is a Republican in my mind. She talks just like one.</comment>

<comment>The right isn't sold on wrecking our economy in exchange for non-binding pledges from China and India. </comment>

<comment>Too bad you haven't shown how the economy would be wrecked. Then again, why should I expect right-wingers to understand economics? These are the same idiots who still believe in trickle down.</comment>

<comment>Trickle down is a straw man, but you're referring to is really bad supply side economics and that is real.</comment>

<comment>Prove it.</comment>

<comment>Thomas Sowell wrote something on this:http://www.nationalreview.com/...</comment>

<comment>Ah yes. A common right-wing tactic. When you tell a lie, just claim you never said it. I guess that's easier than admitting you lied in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Hilarious. He's a liberal, but he's smarter than you. </comment>

<comment>Hilarious. The article he linked doesn't actually support his argument and you look like a fool for praising him. Then again, you're used to embarrassing yourself around here.</comment>

<comment>Even being an economic conservative I don't fear Sanders or Clinton.  Why?  It's all hot air.  None of their leftist policies have a prayer of getting through the House which the GOP is almost certain to control for as far as the eye can see.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  Partisans of all stripes are advised to remember this.  Otherwise, the same unfulfilled irrational expectations that dislillusioned many to Obama will simply happen again.Same for the extreme right partisans...  even if the GOP wins the presidency, they are likely to lose seats in the senate.  Repealing Obamacare would have the same impact they complain about now...  dislocating millions from the insurance plans they have and like...  it simply won't happen.Change in America is almost always incremental.  The revolution, whichever way you want it, is unlikely at best.</comment>

<comment>I agree with everything you said with one qualifier.  The vast majority of those that actually like the insurance plan they ended up with due to Obamacare are those newly enrolled in Medicaid.</comment>

<comment>I love my new employer-provided plan post Obamacare.  My rates have been increasing at roughly 5% per year vs, 15% pre-ACA, and my coverage is better too because of the ACA mandates on preventative care, maternity coverage, etc.ACA plans in general are costing less than projected when the bill passed.</comment>

<comment>Congratulations as you are in the minority.  As the stop loss provisions expire and the largest insurer exits the program, the result is predictable to any non-biased person.  Since you shared your personal story, I will as well.  I was one of the people lied to and lost my 17 year policy due to not including some mandates that I would never use.  Rather than subsidize this scheme VIA a 300% premium increase, I am uninsured for the first time at 46 and avoid the tax penalty by making sure I don't have a refund coming.  I just wanted to be left alone but that was obviously too much to ask this corporatist/socialist.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that not having a refund has nothing to do with the applicability of the penalty, right?  The penalty might reduce your refund, or increase you tax bill...  but it isn't non-applicable just because you are net positive/negative in your tax balance before filing.Also, if your policy increased by 300%, you probably had lousy coverage before...  or need to shop around some more.  Or, it may be true...  but in that case, pretty much all nonpartisan analysis would say that you are the minority, not me.If UHC does indeed pull out of the exchanges, that will be interesting.  But I'm not sure even UHC can afford to ignore the millions of potential customers in the exchanges, and even still that won't prevent them from offering ACA compliant plans to employers (e.g., like the one I currently have that is a UHC administered plan, and which will still be in place next year).Anyway, your apparent lack of understanding of tax law makes me dubious of your understanding of the ACA.</comment>

<comment>My understanding of tax law is, respectfully, clearly better than yours.  Yes, they can charge me but the ACA provides them no legal method to COLLECT it other than attaching refunds.  They can't levy my bank account, put liens on my property, etc.  With respect to my 17 year policy being lousy, who are you to decide?  I was happy with it and it served my needs.  Yes, I did have to pay the first $5,000 annually regardless but it was more than worth it for the extremely low premium.</comment>

<comment>Obamacare works much better in competitive, urban markets. It works very poorly in rural areas where, say, one hospital system dominates.Plus - recall - taxpayers are covering, on average, 75% of the premiums. </comment>

<comment>Obamacare in general works better in States that have made a good faith/strong effort to make it effective.   Those mostly have been the more blue/purple "urban" states, but it works fine in the rural areas of my state, and by everything I heard improved on the old status quo.  It worked quite well in KY.  Those state governments that wanted it to not work well kind of had a self-fulfilling prophesy.The number of hospitals, etc. doesn't matter as much as the number of insurers competing.   Healthcare access (either actual physical access or acceptance of plans by the sole healthcare provider)  in rural areas will always be an issue, but it isn't really the issue the ACA was trying to fix.Given the vast majority of US citizens live in urban areas, a policy that is good for them is still probably on net a positive for the nation.  That doesn't mean we should think about ways to make it work better for rural areas, but we shouldn't scrap a policy that works for more folks than it doesn't just because there are some folks that are "losers" in the policy change.</comment>

<comment>You have to separate the Medicaid expansion from the exchanges. </comment>

<comment>Why?...  we're talking about the whole system.  The whole point of the ACA was the different parts worked together.  The mandate allows the universal coverage/pre-exisitng conditions changes.  The medicaid expansion allowed the mandate (by giving folks that couldn't afford it a way into the system).  Why would we judge the individual parts and not the net effect of the whole?</comment>

<comment>This is a shamefully biased, downright stupid polemic. Hillary Clinton's so-called foreign policy expertise is her needless war on Libya that turned it into a failed state, costing thousands of lives; her near destruction of Egypt and her support for Syria's Sunni Islamist revolt. All that, and her support for smashing the status quo in Ukraine--installing a rightwing regime that extols Nazi collaborators--in order to menace and further the breakup of Russia--a mad objective.</comment>

<comment>You'll have a very hard time finding an average American who doesn't agree with Bernie Sanders 1000% on this. Trying to marginalize him to merely being 'populist' is frankly pathetic.</comment>

<comment>Using populist as an insult is idiotic on its face, all politicians are populist at some point, they need to be in order to win in any functioning democracy.</comment>

<comment>It's always my favorite article when they say things like populace position won't win you elections, when all elections are, is a popularity contest. It means the candidate they want isn't popular. If you're worried about foreign affairs, Clinton's record is atrocious. She wants a no fly zone, which means we are back in Iraq. Sanders has a sane plan, regime change has never worked. We have to let the people of those countries choose for themselves. We need to lead BY EXAMPLE. The better foreign policy plan has to be to get off of fossil fuels as fast as we can. Not to mention its good for the environment. This race isn't really about how bad s president Clinton would be it's really about how much BETTER the outcome for Democrats if Sanders is the nomination. He gets independent votes that WILL NOT vote for Clinton otherwise. He gets the enthusiasm which would bring the Senate back to the Democrats and at very least make it possible to get the House back in the midterms. A strong domestic policy effects us directly. We face NO existential threat to our country from the middle east. I want to be tough on terrorism but really the only way they will get us is if we go over there to let them shoot at us again. We DO have existential threats with climate change. We DO have existential threats with poverty and we NEED criminal justice reform. All these things will make us BETTER at handling foreign affairs. We need to get our house in order first. We don't like to say it, but we need to clean up our own example to lead the rest of the world by our example. Otherwise we continue to look like hypocrites.</comment>

<comment>A "populist" position is not the same as a popular position.Trump is a populist, and spouts populist policies.  Populist policies are often one that are emotionally satisfying, but may not be practical or supportable in the institutions of government/society.  "Populist" doesn't mean those policies will ever be POPULAR with enough people to win an election.  They will be very popular with some folks, but that may just be a biggish minority of voters.Now that said, a little "populist" fervor could certainly do the Dems some good in terms of motivating their supporters and .  The biggest issue the Dems have faced since the 1990s when they triangulated the GOP and moved to the center is that they have become of party of "wonkish" rather than "populist" policies...  the policies aren't emotionally satisfying, necessitate tradeoffs and costs, and are complex but they are intellectually rigorous in terms of cost/benefit, etc.  But many "populists" don't like tradeoffs or complexity...  they want the easy answer, regardless of practicality or potential downsides.Wonkish policies can transcend their lack of popular resonance with charismatic individual candidates like Bill Clinton and Obama, but the same policies flounder a bit when presented by a less compelling spokesperson (Gore, Kerry, HRC?).  Which is probably why Bernie and Hillary are both adopting a more "populist" tone.</comment>

<comment>The DJIA is sliding lower.  China may be going into a recession.  The economic bounce enjoyed by the Obama administration may be over.  Scrap steel fetches 1/6 the price it enjoyed a few years ago.  And Bernie wants to break up the big banks.  If we slide back into a recession, banks will consolidate further.</comment>

<comment>That's the problem - whatever happened to the law that kept these giant corps from consolidating?  I thought that went out with Ma Bell but here it is again.  Guess that's why we need Glass-Stegall, because they weakened the original one.  And now no Glass-Stegall unless Bernie.</comment>

<comment>All you're actually laying forth is that Americans are a people manipulated by propaganda and fear into supporting the goals of the class of great wealth.</comment>

<comment>It's definitely time for Bernie to discuss foreign policy.  I'm already on his side about everything else, but am floundering on this and I think most of his fans are too.  I'm one of those who will not vote for Hillary so I will vote for Bernie anyway, but I'd feel more comfortable if I could know he's not some kind of lunatic on foreign policy.</comment>
