<comment>Americans love you when both political parties hate you.Pivotal moments of history don't happen often, enjoy this one tonight.Trump 2016!</comment>

<comment>You mean people will actually watch the debates w/o trump? Wha wha what?</comment>

<comment>1. Trump issued his Muslims plan >1 month ago. Has anyone with any power come out in favor of his plan? Has anyone in Congress pledged to make it into a bill?2. If Trump had proposed *stringent* checking of refugees and immigrants, had mentioned it in every speech in addition to what else he does, and had mobilized his fans to demand it, isn't it likely that would have forced Obama and Congress to do what he demanded or close to it?3. Has Trump or a Trump fan ever shown anyone wrong about anything? I don't mean mocking their disability (allegedly) or calling them names, but intellectually engaging that person's argument and showing their argument wrong to the person's supporters?</comment>

<comment>" 1. Trump issued his Muslims plan >1 month ago. Has anyone with any power come out in favor of his plan? Has anyone in Congress pledged to make it into a bill?"No, because virtually everyone in congress is bought and paid for by an establishment who controls both parties and want unfettered 3rd world immigration. The left used to complain about the corporate and international money influencing our politics. Seems Trump is the only one doing that now." 2. If Trump had proposed *stringent* checking of refugees and immigrants, had mentioned it in every speech in addition to what else he does, and had mobilized his fans to demand it, isn't it likely that would have forced Obama and Congress to do what he demanded or close to it?"No. Same answer as above." 3. Has Trump or a Trump fan ever shown anyone wrong about anything? I don't mean mocking their disability (allegedly) or calling them names, but intellectually engaging that person's argument and showing their argument wrong to the person's supporters?"Have you ever one asked a question that wasn't willfully disingenuous? Or framed in hostile and mocking tone?</comment>

<comment>1. Money is a big factor, but they also know that supporting a plan to ban people of one religion from the U.S. would be the end of their political careers. And, if Trump is elected, all that means that they aren't going to sit idly by if he tries to keep out all Muslims: they're going to pull his funding, censure him, etc. etc. IOW, Trump's plan is meaningless as a way to keep out terrorists: his plan will never happen. Instead, we'll have Obama's agenda for 12 more months.2. You're wrong about that, because Congress is considering (and might have passed) more stringent checking. More stringent checking isn't as controversial as keeping out all Muslims and if someone doesn't want it then it's easy to portray them as soft on terrorism. Trump could have easily done that - perhaps by calling out individual Congressmembers at his events - but - surprise, surprise - he pandered to mouthbreathers instead.3. Thank you for illustrating one of my points.</comment>

<comment>I don't think it has to do with worrying about their political careers. Its just that they have some form of morals or conscience (i.e. while lots of people talk about it, most people don't actually want to be like Hitler).</comment>

<comment>" 1. Money is a big factor, but they also know that supporting a plan to ban people of one religion from the U.S. would be the end of their political careers. And, if Trump is elected, all that means that they aren't going to sit idly by if he tries to keep out all Muslims: they're going to pull his funding, censure him, etc. etc. "There's so much wrong with that sentence I don't know where to start, so...1. Provide a quote from Trump where he said " I will ban all Muslims forever. " A least dig it up and look at the quote so you can be honest about what he actually said. Most Americans , even ones who hate, him find it prudent and reasonable to put moratorium on Muslim immigration in light of recent events.2 Unlike every other candidate, Trump is NOT dependent on donors $$$ , so who exactly is going to " pull his funding? "3.  "More stringent checking " as you put it, shows how little you understand about where most these refugees come from. Background checks are impossible for someone coming from a country that keeps no records on it's citizens. Furthermore what Europe is learning right now is that most "refugees" are providing false documentation, often claiming to be from a country they've never even visited.5. "...it's easy to portray them as soft on terrorism" You are living the past.  You need stop referring to others as " mouth breathers "Obama  " The future does not belong to those who insult Islam. " Obama on the morning of the ISIS Paris attack " ISIS is contained "Obama 2 days before the San Bernardino attack, regarding the state governors who will refuse to settle Muslim refugees " These people are afraid of widows and orphans "</comment>

<comment>Hello Simon Corso. I've written thousands of posts about immigration since 2002. Unless you can provide evidence of you have thousands of posts about the issue, I think everyone can safely assume I know a whole lot more about it than you do. I've seen all of this before.One of those posts is about Trump's Muslims plan, so I'm quite familiar with what he said. Whether his ban is temporary or permanent, it's still a ban. And, a ban on one religion entering the U.S. is not practical and will never happen. Trump's "solution" to terrorism is no solution at all because it won't be implemented.People like you are dangerous because you aren't smart enough to realize it won't be implemented. So, instead of promoting realistic plans that would solve the problem, you take up a lot of space promoting completely unrealistic plans. That means more potential terrorists will enter the U.S. and amnesty fans will continue to get their way. Mouthbreathers like you and all the other Trump/Teaparty types have consistently helped Obama, Hillary, and other amnesty supporters. You're part of the problem.</comment>

<comment>" 3. Has Trump or a Trump fan ever shown anyone wrong about anything? I don't mean mocking their disability (allegedly) or calling them names, but intellectually engaging that person's argument and showing their argument wrong to the person's supporters?"Quoting this again because I've responded to you thus far without insult or derision. Meanwhile you've done virtually nothing but attack with insults. " mouthbreathers ,tea party, part of the problem "etc.You say..."I've written thousands of posts about immigration since 2002."Which basically says..." I've been posting outright lies and disingenuous bullshit about immigration for 14 years so that means I'm right about everything."Let me introduce you to Public Law 114http://www.bu.edu/lawlibrary/P...Start on page 182 for the relevant parts." SEC. 212.(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Act, tile following classes of aliens shall be ineligible to receive visas and shall be excluded from admission into the United States:(1) Aliens who are feeble-minded;(2) Aliens who are insane;(3) Aliens who have had one or more attacks of insanity;(4) Aliens afflicted with psychopathic personality, epilepsy, or a mental defect."Sounds like they're talking about Muslims to me... But wait, there's more."(F) Aliens who advocate or teach or who are members of or affiliated with any organization that advocates or teaches (i) theoverthrow by force, violence, or other unconstitutional means of the Government of the United States or of all forms of law; or(ii) the duty, necessity, or propriety of the unlawful assaulting or killing of any officer or officers (either of specific individuals or of officers generally) of the Government of the United States or of any other organized government, because of his or their official character; or (iii) the unlawful damage, injury, or destruction of property; or (iv) sabotage "The Qu'ran, Hadith and Sharia law require complete submission to Islam.The Qu'ran and Hadith require violent overthrow of any governmental system that stands in the way of Sharia Law or submission to Islam. Thus it is perfectly legal to deny Muslim immigrants entry to the US.</comment>

<comment>"Simon Corso" appears to be an OFA/Hillary mole. Otherwise it wouldn't falsely claim that I've posted "outright lies and disingenuous bullshit about immigration".The fact is that over thousands of posts I've only had to issue a few corrections. No one else has had to issue so few corrections and there are those (like Gateway Pundit) who rarely issue corrections even when they're outrageously wrong.If "Simon Corso" weren't a likely OFA/Hillary mole it would help me with my campaigns rather than lying about me. For instance, it could help with these many posts showing Obama wrong:24ahead.com/s/obama-immigratio...Obviously, OFA/Hillary volunteers aren't likely to help me undercut Obama or Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Oh, and by the way he's raised over 5 million for vets with his special event tonight.</comment>

<comment>Uh uh. For the Trump Foundation. The Foundation gives some money to vets. It donated more to the Clintons, It's disgusting to treat vets like props.</comment>

<comment>The game has changed. Trump is most likely to win doing exactly what he is doing. Congress will do nothing until he forces their hand. In fact, as we have seen, Congress is currently facilitating the importation of thousands of invaders out of spite. They are bussed to random states whose executive branch is not informed of their presence. They are immediately given access to welfare programs.I'm not sure how asking more nicely will stop this.</comment>

<comment>No Donald, no viewers.</comment>

<comment>LOL!  Huckabee is at The Donald's event.</comment>

<comment>No way -so sweet. I love Huckabee, but that's hilarious! </comment>

<comment>First question is about Trump's absence. 👏👏</comment>

<comment>I was sure it would be.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz opens up with a Trump joke.  That's a bold strategy Cotton, let's see how it plays out for him.</comment>

<comment>Crowd loved it</comment>

<comment>Can't you just let me enjoy quoting a movie?</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I didn't catch the reference </comment>

<comment>It was a decent answer. I hope Cruz wins the nom and Trump goes 3rd party!</comment>

<comment>Faking </comment>

<comment>Cruz not funny though---poor Cruz :(Trump raised $5M for Vets- Go Trump!!</comment>

<comment>He'd make a great president, for Canada.</comment>

<comment>Trump is now listing the names of his rich billionaire friends....Oh, wait is this the wrong debate?</comment>

<comment>All candidates should have to list their billionaire friends, and then list all their friends who make under $50K.</comment>

<comment>Protesters at Trumps rally wait for the exact moment that Fox goes to commercial to disrupt.  What a bunch of posers.</comment>

<comment>Marco Rubio wants to play army.</comment>

<comment>Killary voted for the Iraq war "with conviction."</comment>

<comment>That's why we're supporting Bernie.</comment>

<comment>He is no moderate. He is as far right as Cruz or Trump. If he gets the nomination, he'll try to pivot away from the incendiary statements he's made, but they are all recorded for posterity. Plenty of material for Hillary to use against him.</comment>

<comment>Breaking !!! Trump winning debate without even attending.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Is Ben Carson on quaaludes?</comment>

<comment>I think he puts himself to sleep.</comment>

<comment>This comment section is dead without The Donald debating.</comment>

<comment>Yes - because everything, everywhere, is about Trump, even the number of comments in a thread!  Trump 2016!</comment>

<comment>Bush is 6`3 or 4 but has the body language of a very short, intimidated man.Weird.</comment>

<comment>I bet big bro kicked the shit out of him alot when they were kids.</comment>

<comment>The Bush family is more genetically deficient than the Habsburgs.</comment>

<comment>"anyone is welcome "if they want to accept our values and our laws." Chances are, that answer probably won't comfort the aforementioned mother too much.Why would it bother anyone if they would accept our values and our laws???</comment>

<comment>It's a party tonight with a debate no one should bother watching and Trump on the other channels.</comment>

<comment>I'm not watching, but from what this article says, Trump is talking more about himself and his campaign than about the veterans? Is anyone surprised at that behavior from this narcissist?</comment>

<comment>That's 100% not true. I'm watching and it's all about the Vets with Green Beret speakers and Trump thanking all the big donors. </comment>

<comment>I was referring to Trump's opening statement, as referenced in this article. You're saying he talked only about veterans, and didn't make the statements referenced here?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I never attacked anyone. I was just clarifying whether you all are saying the Atlantic is lying in this article. You want an attack? You're one of the shittiest trolls on this site, and that's saying something.</comment>

<comment>*Edit *Correction: Trump did a brief intro and it's been all vets since.</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic was referring to a 25 minute "Stump speech" at around 9:30.</comment>

<comment>It was Trump, then some billionaire friend, then Trump again, then Santorum and Huckabee, and for some reason his wife was called on stage, then one Vet (who avoided politics unlike Trump) then it was over.</comment>

<comment>I wish one of the well-heeled moderators would ask the GOP candidates what they think about the Obamacare provision covering people with pre-existing conditions. Do their "free market" solutions deal with that? Cruz's response about Obamacare was detail-free, and the "journalist" moderator did no follow-up.Btw, I turned this "debate" on about 20 minutes ago and there's been 10 minutes' worth of commercials.</comment>

<comment>"I wish". What a pathetic thing to say. Instead of wishing, figure out how to get what you want or at least help those who know how to do it.Instead of wishing fake-journalists would do something, go undercut them by asking the question yourself. Or, find people in Iowa who can do it.Every 4 years the stooges in Iowa let down the USA by failing to *really* press the candidates on policy. Call them out individually. Shame them into doing their jobs as citizens.</comment>

<comment>I wish I were as smart and brave as you.</comment>

<comment>You, like almost all other "conservatives" or those in their sphere I've had the misfortune to encounter, aren't helping with my smart, effective plan that would stop Obama's immigration agenda. The reason is because you and they aren't smart and rational.For that reason, I'm sure you reflexively object, without a moment's thinking. Since that's the case, please tell us the best way to stop Obama's immigration agenda right now.</comment>

<comment>Someone is about to get beaten up at Trump's rally.</comment>

<comment>Yes!</comment>

<comment>Some of the vibes at his events are scary. With one word he could have someone kilt.</comment>

<comment>Throw them out and take their coats!</comment>

<comment>That's how stupid the American electorate is.</comment>

<comment>We are the new Germans.</comment>

<comment>Better than the cuck Germans who are being raped and charged with crimes if they speak out against the rapes.</comment>

<comment>Never heard of them.</comment>

<comment>I wish one of them had worn a white seersucker suit.</comment>

<comment>A couple of black women are talking smack about the other candidates at Trumps place. You cant make this stuff up.</comment>

<comment>I felt like I was watching da da theatre . . .we live in strange times.</comment>

<comment>I thought i had flipped to Basketball Wives of Hotlanta.</comment>

<comment>Maybe Black women have seen how they have been replaced by Mexicans in neighborhoods around the country and fighting between groups has affected their men. When you think of Compton, who do you think of? Check the latest census.Unless promoting the interests of American Blacks was never really about them, but just anti American Whites. Nah.</comment>

<comment>Jeez, talk about a photo of the "B-Team."  See top lol.</comment>

<comment>I like the way Cruz is holding up his tummy. Strangely, it's not Christie.</comment>

<comment>It's called a man-girdle, dude...old Hollywood trick.</comment>

<comment>If Christie is wearing a girdle it should get combat pay.</comment>

<comment>Nah, nobody else is.  Just Cruz.----Edit:  And if Christie wore one, he'd probably pass out lol.</comment>

<comment>I'd really like to hear what Kasich has to say...</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure you have to be in a diner in Iowa or NH for that to happen.</comment>

<comment>How can I bait trolls there?</comment>

<comment>You cant</comment>

<comment>The echo chamber is very boring.</comment>

<comment>Youre just mad you got banned</comment>

<comment>Not really.So are you a racist, or not?El Jefe calls you a racist.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Have you visited their echo chamber yet?You should go and drop a deuce on their circle jerk.</comment>

<comment>I opened my profile for him to find any racist statements   he disappeared</comment>

<comment>So you feel a need to justify yourself for a pukehead like El Jefe?Interesting.Why can't you just say:"I'm not a racist."I do it all the time.</comment>

<comment>I did he then called me a coward for having my history closed so i opened it up and said put up or shut up  he never said another word</comment>

<comment>So you didn't just have the balls to say:"Shut up, Jefe, I am not a racist!"Maybe you are a coward since you played his game and cowered to his demand.</comment>

<comment>You are entitled to your opinion ;)</comment>

<comment>As long as you play Jefe's stupid game, you deserve to be ridiculed.Go back to your echo chamber to see if the goat will give you an upvote and to see if Sherri approves of your contributions.Embrace the suck, Limoboy.</comment>

<comment>I see why you got banned .</comment>

<comment>No, you don't.</comment>

<comment>Youre roadkill  over there dude.</comment>

<comment>I think it is amusing when "liberals" create an echo chamber and pat each other on the back while they do it.Censorship is all you have, loser.Flame on, Liberace.</comment>

<comment>You dufus Im not a lib i am just for civility .</comment>

<comment>Badump.. Tish</comment>

<comment>Oh WTF!!! No one said Paul was going to be in this one...</comment>

<comment>He made it worth watching.</comment>

<comment>Indeed he did. Wasn't going to watch but just turned it on.</comment>

<comment>God Almighty, this sounds boring ... and vapid. How many people are watching this?  How many from Iowa?</comment>

<comment>Rubio up on Christian horse again.</comment>

<comment>He's going to lead the New Crusades.</comment>

<comment>Christie is such a pathetic scumbag with his "talk straight into the camera" gimmick and his sad "catch phrases" ("Clinton blah blah public housing").</comment>

<comment>Sadly, we know what all of them are going to say. And how poorly they say it.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't mind seeing Rubio try to walk on water.</comment>

<comment>Preferably after he's dropped into really deep water from a helicopter or something. Can't believe how many people are falling for this slick cardboard cutout.</comment>

<comment>Rubio seems like a smart and kind person. Not much to dislike.</comment>

<comment>Good one!</comment>

<comment>That amnesty answer though, what a slime.</comment>

<comment>Yes Gang of 8 did him in. He'd be a good VP though. </comment>

<comment>Marco Cuban Mafia Rubio would know all about gangs.</comment>

<comment>Ha he's seems too teddy bearish</comment>

<comment>He looks 16.</comment>

<comment>Ha that's really young </comment>

<comment>I thought he was a Senate paige the first time I saw him.</comment>

<comment>Lol He seems sweet-hearted, almost too much for the job. </comment>

<comment>You keep saying that. Why would the vapid little sanctimonious warmonger-wannabe make a good VP?</comment>

<comment>To get the Establishment to not become traitors (for Hillary) and he knows his stuff....and he's a rising star. </comment>

<comment>He has memorized a bunch of talking points. That is not knowing his stuff he's lost when taken off topic.</comment>

<comment>He's Hillary's lost and equally vapid son.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Megyn pulls for him and still Jeb. She tries to be slightly deceptive but she's now just open about it. Too bad he's a puppet. VP material maybe.</comment>

<comment>It is really odd the way Rubio speaks.</comment>

<comment>Bullshit always sounds that way</comment>

<comment>Memorized BS at that...</comment>

<comment>How so?</comment>

<comment>robotic and sterile and canned, and rote, and scripted, and insincere, and douchey.</comment>

<comment>Ha not that bad. He makes good points though. </comment>

<comment>His coaches have prepared him.Total douche.</comment>

<comment>A nice VP though- just a little young perhaps. </comment>

<comment>He's a sellout.Only racists want him as a VP choice.</comment>

<comment>Racists? </comment>

<comment>Yes.People who want a "minority" as VP in order to placate the racist attacks from the left.Racists.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is not very convincing as a minority.</comment>

<comment>He's pre-pubescent.Wait until his nads drop and he might become more persuasive.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he's very convincing as pre-pubescent.  I'll wait for the press release on the nads.</comment>

<comment>So Racists want Rubio so they aren't called Racists by other Racists?Man, Right-Wing politics is so confusing.</comment>

<comment>Not really.Moronic racists who judge Rubio as qualified just because he is Latino are just as stupid as the people who voted for Barry because he is black.Racists.</comment>

<comment>English coaching lessons really paid off.</comment>

<comment>That immigration question with AUDIO clips of his lies was a punch to his throat.He never recovered.</comment>

<comment>I didn't watch the debate so Rubio got busted on his immigration stance?</comment>

<comment>HARD!</comment>

<comment>Rubio sided with Schumer.  Did he think the people would not remember?</comment>

<comment>That's Fox's fault not Rubio's.</comment>

<comment>The media and the political elite are one big happy family.</comment>

<comment>Just like the Clintons.Mutual parasitism.</comment>

<comment>Clintons had to marry into Goldman Sachs.</comment>

<comment>Still can't fix Chelsea's teeth.That's a genetic horse face.</comment>

<comment>Or how Murdoch the main shareholder of Fox is co chairman of a pro immigration organization which at least half of Americans are against. I am sure the percentage is way higher than 50% of Fox watchers are against immigration.</comment>

<comment>America for the Natives!Isn't Murdoch himself Australian? </comment>

<comment>Isn't it common knowledge that these debates are completely scripted?</comment>

<comment>Jeb is spoon fed questions by Fox.  Fox is filled with former Bushies.</comment>

<comment>It is.</comment>

<comment>People have daughters who work?!!!! What century is this! What ever has happened to the idle rich...</comment>

<comment>It sounds like Marco got sucker punched and Megyn isn't happy about Trump's awol.</comment>

<comment>Cruz demanded time to respond because a question mentioned his name.Sorry, poindexter, it doesn't work that way.</comment>

<comment>Christ Rubio...or Rubio Christ?</comment>

<comment>Given the popularity of the hunger games, I hope the next debate involves swords and crossbows.They all start at their podiums and race toward the center to get the crossbow.  The slowest ones get the swords.</comment>

<comment>Would the hosts be involved?</comment>

<comment>Eventually.They can only ask questions to the survivors.</comment>

<comment>Does Ben Carson get stupider every day?  Extrapolating backward, he may have invented calculus and the theory of relativity as a toddler.</comment>

<comment>trump using appreciation of the vets, which most americans have already, to avert saying  how he is going to achieve any goal he has stated</comment>

<comment>And one must wonder if the vets this draft dodger really means are the russians he used in his ad.  New Yorkers know that he has continually turfed disabled vets off the pavement in front of the gauche trump tower, refusing the one opportunity these men have providing for themselves.</comment>

<comment>He's no dummy! If Obama had told us going in what he was going to do and how he would do it we'd have hung him on the spot. Trump knows this and is following suit. Let's put it this way, Trump IS going to do what he's said he will do and when he does you will be screaming; "Bloody murder!"</comment>

<comment>a good businessman doesnt show his handhave a look at the liberal side - what they've achieved either takes the country backwards or just isn't worth mentioning</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic threads have really gone downhill in the past year...At least the worst offenders have finally left.Now we can get down to some good conversation while the echo chamber absorbs the cultists who used to infest this thread.Where is Deus Iguana?</comment>

<comment>Yes.He posted some faggy "get-to-know you" post on their echo chamber.He revealed where he lives , works, studies, and his name as "garrett."I don't remember the other details, but I thought knowing his real name would be fun to actually mess with his schizophrenia.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>MD.I think that's what he said.He might have taken it down by now, but he posted a bunch of crap.He doesn't understand how much he is hated over there.</comment>

<comment>Not as much as you though</comment>

<comment>You're just mad because the mods over there banned several of your "incarnations". Everyone is having a good chuckle about that.</comment>

<comment>I was banned earlier today.Are you keeping track?Is that your task in the circle jerk?Your echo chamber is so boring that you try to keep track of which alternative voices you have banned?Weird.</comment>

<comment>So Trump really pulled a fast one on Santorum and Huckster by making them stand behind a TRUMP podium.Can't believe they fell for that.</comment>

<comment>Christie sounded like a real douche tonight saying that America needs to defend the intelligence community and law enforcement.They are not the ones who I think of as victims in any of this mess.</comment>

<comment>the Trump is actually moving the process along.He's got his spot.The remaining candidates need to fight among themselves to challenge him.Its actually good darwinism.</comment>

<comment>The last debate should allow guns on stage. Last man standing wins!Sponsored by the NRA of course.</comment>

<comment>That will be a last resort.And liberals dont want that.Their slums of goons dont shoot straight.</comment>

<comment>Say, are these debates Gun Free Zones? I'm surprised no one is bringing in AKs... seems very unsafe.</comment>

<comment>Nah, I'm not buying it.  This isn't credibly 'accidentally comedic',  this must have been scripted as a comedy.  Aaron Sorkin and Tina Fey were in a meeting yesterday, and they decided to scare the bejesus out of Estonia and Finland.We are onto you America.  We know the nation that brought us the lightbulb, the aeroplane and the moonshot isn't this stupid.  It's a ploy.  Just like when you scared the USSR senseless by electing an awful actor suffering from dementia so that you could convince them you really were mad enough to launch a nuclear war.If I was to write a play pastiching US politics, nobody would read it if I took it to such extremes.  Stop with all this larking about, show us who the real candidates are.</comment>

<comment>Naturally.When you pretend to be authoritarian, you really suck.It's probably not your nature.That's why you get bullied into being an authoritarian censor in your echo chamber.If  you had more backbone I would respect you more, but for now I will just say that I like some of your posts.</comment>

<comment>Pat is here and it's not Trump</comment>

<comment>No shid!Trump and I have very different reasons to detest Garret, but our common ground is detesting Killary more and enjoying the mockery of Bradan/TAdghmor,Brain-fFeces, Naidm.</comment>

<comment>See, you're identifiable by the Killary Klottin line. </comment>

<comment>I don't mind if Trump uses Killary Clottin' in his posts.He seems above that, though.</comment>

<comment>Pat is the only one who uses it, you. I forget your older aliases. </comment>

<comment>Solid gold.</comment>

<comment>I'd be willing to give Bradan a second chance if he gets his ѕhit straight, but I doubt he will. I think he has actual psychological issues.</comment>

<comment>YA think?</comment>

<comment>Wow, you've been stalking quite a long time haven't you my dear?  What does your shrink think of that?</comment>

<comment>No.  I bumped into Trump here on the Atlantic Thread about a month ago.He legitimately likes Trump and I don't.We have had our falling outs, but our mutual disgust with Bill's wife keeps us civil.</comment>

<comment>Rubio got destroyed. Bush did OK. Kasich tried. Christie came off as a creep.</comment>

<comment>Are those growths on the side of Christie's mouth getting larger?Moles?Food chunks?Hard to distinguish.</comment>

<comment>its a sand dune that washed up from Jacob</comment>

<comment>I agree.  But Cruz and Rubio got all the face time and Paul and Kasich weren't allowed to speak much, Bush and Carson fell asleep</comment>

<comment>They both used their time wisely.I wish Paul would have landed a few more punches with trump off the stage.</comment>

<comment>i really expected he would.  but he seemed too reasoned and calm i think</comment>

<comment>I don't know if that was due to strategy, or if someone is coaching him to play it so mellow.I look forward to the result of the Iowa vote.Maybe that will get Trump humbled a bit.</comment>

<comment>Interesting.Tell me about the substance of hillary?</comment>

<comment>M O N E Y</comment>

<comment>Okay.Who's money?</comment>

<comment>Anyone who will give it to her .</comment>

<comment>But theres more to it then that,its not just a matter of throwing money at hillary for no reason...</comment>

<comment>Have you been reading??  The FBI is done with her e mails  they are now only  looking at the contributions and the contracts handed out from state after contributions to the foundation</comment>

<comment>Thats not the point I was making.All that money is an investment in her becoming president.And paying all that back 100 fold like wallstreet.</comment>

<comment>Yes thats  the new money its the foundation money thats going to be her downfall . Another story today that FBI Director Comey will resign if Loretta Lynch refuses to indict her</comment>

<comment>Fools and their money...soon part ways</comment>

<comment>I suspect that the undermining of the GOP into the military branch of the hollywood agenda began with ragun.</comment>

<comment>Can you Explain what you mean? I am no fan of Reagan and think he was over rated in a few respects.</comment>

<comment>I was looking at how the supreme court monopoly became this way, and it started with ragun.Ragun appointed 2 new yorkers/new jersey/california,Clinton appointed 2 new yorkers/new jersey/california,dubya appointed 2 new yorkers/new jersey/california,obo appointed 2 new yorkers/new jersey/california,And there are no conservatives in hollywood.Its a dang darn coinky dink.</comment>

<comment>So you are saying that his appointees had something to do with the start of the decline of the military? I do not see the military tie in you were referring to.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say anything about military.But now that you mention it, it seems to me that ragun and the neo-cons was the beginning on the conversion of the GOP into the military branch of the liberal agenda.In exchange for support in the new york times and a profit.</comment>
