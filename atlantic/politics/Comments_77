<comment>They are tripling down on stupid. If Obama was so bad for the country, where was Jeb? What cool stuff was he doing the past decade he's been MIA? The ineligible Cubans have an excuse. They were growing pubes. No more Bushes!</comment>

<comment>Everyone agrees that another Bush is not what the country needs, especially since they always seem to want to avenge themselves against the country that their Bush predecessor was unable to level.</comment>

<comment>It's a long list, too. Jeb during the debate started talking up his grand plans to topple Assad and we would be greeted as liberators and stay there until the government transitioned into a peaceful and stable one. I think Trump spoke for all of us when he said, "Shut up, dummy! We're still stuck in Iraq, a mistake that cost us $5 trillion and countless lives. You'll have us stuck in the ME for another 15 years."</comment>

<comment>How do you explain the "policies" of the Democrap Party?</comment>

<comment>Trump is our murder weapon for the GOP.  He will win and clean out the globalists who have decimated the middle class.</comment>

<comment>Exactly, 100%, correct.</comment>

<comment>Oh please, not back to claims of a "One World Order."  OK, time to dust off oldies but goodies such as the Council on Foreign Relations and black helicopters.</comment>

<comment>You know, the funny thing down here in this part of Louisiana is that my conservative relatives who had been Republicans but now consider themselves Tea Party types made that transition because they realized (correctly) that the GOP establishment has been playing them for fools for decades.This has not been difficult since many are, in fact, fools.Now that they've decided that those people have been lying to them, though, they can't quite wrap their heads around the concept that, maybe, the things those people have been telling them were lies.So, they're still fully loaded up with that welfare queen, New World Order, Obama's coming to take your guns, Obamacare is socialized Medicine, all immigrants are illegal and they're all from Mexico so let's build a wall, and gay people are coming to rape your puppies and burn your Bibles crap.They know it's true because they heard it from....oh, yeah, the Internet.  That's the ticket!If they didn't constitute a small, but significant, minority of the country they'd be funny.  As it is, we've got a chunk of the population that's just not living on the same planet as everybody else.</comment>

<comment>One of the best sentences I've heard to describe the current GOP. We've got a sizable chunk of the population that simply isn't living on the same planet as everybody else. Thumbs up.</comment>

<comment>Add to that a goodly number of them are also fundamentalist evangelicals (which Ted Cruz bragged were his constituents), and you have the ultimate in gullible rubes.  Just ask the followers of Sarah Palin, who after 8 years FINALLY have repudiated her for her endorsement and campaign speech for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Hey, they don't have to listen to Republicans to learn about Obama's welfare queen, New World Order etc.They only have to listen to Obama and keep their eyes open.In 2000, 17 million people were on food stamps. Now it's 50 million. The wonders of Obama's so-called recovery: welfare instead of work.</comment>

<comment>Foxbot.</comment>

<comment>Dupe. What's your grand plan, to put everybody in America on foodstamps and bill our grandchildren?When we become Greece, there will be no Germany to bail us out. 20 Trillion in debt already, half accumulated by Obama.But you libs claim Obama's 10 trillion of debt doesn't count, because Buuuuush is to blame.</comment>

<comment>you understand that the debt and the deficit are not the same thing right?</comment>

<comment>I do, do you? I said $10 Trillion of new debt and that's what I meant. That's what the total will be by the time Obmaa leaves office.</comment>

<comment>How much of that National debt you are pinning on Obama is interest that had to be paid on the 10 trillion that was run up when Reagan TRIPLED the National debt and Bush DOUBLED the national debt? How much war spending did Obama have to put forth for the TWO wars Bush was running OFF the books?</comment>

<comment>Of course it isn't.  Quit feeding back the garbage that you're fed. You do realize that, by the time you say it, we've heard from dozens of other people before?Here's a hint:  When you can't talk about your own plans (assuming they make some degree of sense), and can only talk about other people's descriptions of other people's plans, it generally means that you ain't got nothin'.</comment>

<comment>LOL .. right .. food stamps is what is breaking the bank.. not trillion dollar wars and trillion dollar defense contracts for planes that can't fly .. or if they can fly .. park them in the desert because the airforce can't use them... keep spouting the nonsensehttp://www.military.com/daily-...</comment>

<comment>According to USDA stats. the snap program in 2008 had 33 million people in it, and in 2015 there was 45 million. The numbers you site are off,  but not by much, so i still get the point your trying to make. The only thing I would add, is that a large contributing factor, as to when there was a significant increase in people needing food stamps, coincided with the greatest loss of wealth and income in the country,  since the great depression.Now if you want to argue that the recession was caused by President Obama, who was not elected until after the crash in the economy, well that is another matter.</comment>

<comment>49 million is the latest number. And you can't even find the 2000 number so you have no business saying it's off."coincided with the greatest loss of wealth and income in the country,  since the great depression"Otherwise known as the Obama "recovery".  Obama took office in the trough of a recession, which ought to have given him easy comparisons. But instead welfare has skyrocketed, while the labor force participation -- even adjusting for an aging population -- has dropped to numbers not seen since Jimmy Carter was in office.</comment>

<comment>Sorry about that, I was not implying that your 2000 # was incorrect, just the 50 mil. one. Actually i went back and looked and my first # was off, the total of 33 mil. was for the year 2009 not 2008. The reason I start there instead of 2000 is because those numbers show the increase during Obama's time in office.To reiterate, your correct to say that Obama came into office during the recession. The point I was making was that he did not cause the recession, so therefore was not responsible for the growth in people needing assistance.It's akin to claiming the rise in people applying for and receiving FEMA loans is related to who was in office at the time the hurricane struck, rather than the hurricane itself.Re: labor force participation, i will refur to an excellent article on that subject in u.s.news:http://www.usnews.com/news/the...In their analogy of whats causing the decline, they mention many factors, but the President is not one of them.I am appreciating the civil back and forth.</comment>

<comment>Charles Murray often quotes the stat for white working-class males in their 30s and 40s. Their participation in the labor force dropped from 96% in 1968 to 79% in 2015.The middle class is being hollowed out as middle class jobs go away. It's very hard to make out that Federal and trade policies have nothing to do with this. One striking feature of Obama's "recovery" is that the growth of small businesses which usually leads recoveries is absent. Business ends outnumber business starts. Regulations and taxes have a lot to do with this.As for US News not blaming the President, permit me to believe that if the President was named Bush, it would be his fault. But under Obama, economic bad news always happens "unexpectedly".Charles Murray article:Trump's Americahttp://www.aei.org/publication...</comment>

<comment>Y'know, I have a theory about all this, and it takes into account another factor that no one's yet talked about in this thread.I consider the lion's share of the debt amassed under Bush to be money that was spent on... well, it wasn't spent in a broad-based, productive way. I tend to characterize it as money that's thrown into a pit and effectively torched.At this point, I make out two inducements to this kind of economic management behavior--and I think they're both ill-considered. One inducement is what I call "economic bloodletting". The idea is that if you drain away vital fluids from the ailing patient, his/her body will instinctively rally in a bid to survive; economically, this means an inducement to increased productivity.If that fails--and,at this point in America's productive history, it is failing--at least you get a secondary "benefit"; a follow-thru on the post-War "rollback" of global socialism, right back onto our own shores. If the money "just isn't there (we have to be adult about this!)", as the politicians paternalistically chide us, then it will of course be impossible even to effect traditional Keynes-style stimulus programs to keep blood (money) delivering oxygen (enfranchisement) to the cells (the American people) that need it.Obama's spending should be seen in this light. While it's important to be able to cite numbers, it's also important to remember that we're talking about people, their livelihoods, and other stuff that more qualitative in nature. In light of qualitative factors, you could roughly say that Obama is spending money, while Bush torched it. Both activities add to the debt, but thinking in the long term should make you feel a little better about Obama's management style, vs. Bush's, uh, non-style.</comment>

<comment>Well hell just get rid of the minimum wage and no one will need food stamps anymore</comment>

<comment>2000 was well before Obama.  In 2009 there were 45M on SNAP vs 51M in 2013.  It's probably less today though.</comment>

<comment>Wasn't there another president in there? I don't think Obama won a 16 year term (although you have to keep your eye on him).</comment>

<comment>ya the economy didn't fall off a cliff either .. sheesh</comment>

<comment>you mock us, but the trilateral commission is a real thing. I read about it on the internet</comment>

<comment>That's the kind of stuff that makes me hot.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure I understand.Many of the globalists are companies that export goods and services ... did you want Trump to "murder"all those companies?Trade is vital to the US economy and hundreds of thousands of US workers and their companies depend on foreign customers for their living.Just how big?On an annual basis, the US Exports total about ~$2,100,000,000,000  (~$2.1 trillion) in goods and services.  The US exports $1,500,000,000,000 in goods (~$1.5 trillion)--makes sense since we're the worlds #1 or #2 manufacturing economy (depending on the exchange rate).  And we export ~$600,000,000,000 ($600 billion) in services. (FWIW, $2.1 trillion is more than triple the amount we spend on social security annually).And we're not talking simple consumer products, the biggest slice of our trade in goods is very high tech industrial machinery and equipment and speciality chemicals.</comment>

<comment>Frum induced me to come up with a catchphrase re this debate issue: "Trump Rips Off the Band-Aid(tm)."</comment>

<comment>Frum's right on the money. I remember reading a piece by a guy who in 2008 infiltrated one of those "Christian" political action organizations that anoints the next "godly" Republican candidate.And already, right out of the gate, they 1) refused to say the 'B' word and would quickly tut-tut you if you had the temerity to do so, 2) incessantly spoke of the futility of looking backward, and 3) had the same old cookie-cutter organizational mandate, to "get a good, Christian man into the Oval Office."The reporter couldn't believe what he was hearing. How decidedly un-self-aware can people collectively be?He famously responded, "So.... George Bush was actually a Wiccan Priestess, and we just didn't know?"</comment>

<comment>The GOP nominating process is more and more like some Dystopic sci-fi movie where blood sport reality game show host Ruchard Dawson eggs on the howling, baying and bloodletting. Welcome to the new Feral Republic of North America. </comment>

<comment>Colbert nailed it with his take on the Presidential race, "The Hungry for Power Games."</comment>

<comment>Not a fan of Trump, but in this instance at the GOP debate, he spoke the truth about GW Bush lies that led to the Iraq war. He exposed the elephant in the room (pun intended).</comment>

<comment>It's not only vicious slander, but drooling stupidity to seriously think Bush lied.That would mean Bush deliberately and knowingly set himself up to be massively humiliated and discredited on the domestic and global stage.</comment>

<comment>Seems like what many reasonable people have acknowledged that W lied about WMD in Iraq has somehow escaped your dumb azz. Keep playing the ostrich with your head in the sand - but that's typical of the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Bush Lied.  American Boys and Girls Died...for what?The 911 hijackers were 15 of 19 Saudis.If we were going to bomb the hell out of someone it should have been Saudi Arabia.</comment>

<comment>You might as well have attacked Sri Lanka. they were just as guilty of 911 as Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Right?</comment>

<comment>Right. Hence the need to lie and fabricate 'evidence'.</comment>

<comment>The Bush family have had a relationship with the House of Saud for a very long time. GW felt that 9/11 would give him a mandate to finish what his father started, and that Saddam tried to kill his daddy. Two birds with one misdirected stone.</comment>

<comment>You are an unpleasant reminder of how libs argue foreign policy like eight year-olds.</comment>

<comment>If we had attacked Saudi Arabia as you suggest, we would have been doing EXACTLY what Osama bin Laden wanted us to do.  The PURPOSE of the 9111 attack was to drive a wedge between us and the Saudi Royal family."You should read more history, Ensign!" --Captain Picard.</comment>

<comment>LMFAO!So why did we attack iraq instead?</comment>

<comment>You laugh, but by laughing you show only your ignorance.  Every report on 9111, and bin Laden's own writings, show that his goal in arranging the 9111 attacks was to alienate USA from the Saudi Royal family.We attacked Iraq because W wanted to look tough.</comment>

<comment>So why did the Saudis financially support him?</comment>

<comment>The Saudi government didn't support him.  He was their enemy.  They tried to catch him.  He mostly funded himself with his inherited wealth.  He had some furtive support from some individual Saudi citizens, but that would not justify attacking the country, which would have been exactly what he most wanted us to do.</comment>

<comment>The sanctions on Iraq were breaking down. Colin Powell had gone to the UN to try to shore them up in Sept 2001, to no avail.At some point soon the US would have had to back down, end the sanctions, end the no-fly zones, let Saddam get his oil money back and massacre the Kurds and the Shia again. In 2001 the Arab League was already kissing up to Saddam in anticipation of his newfound freedom and "triumph".In the wake of 9/11, backing down to Saddam was an unacceptable option to GW Bush.</comment>

<comment>RE: "In the wake of 9/11, backing down to Saddam was an unacceptable option to GW Bush."  Saddam had nothing to do with 9111.  Your statement is like saying "in the wake of 9111, backing down to the ruler of Sri Lanka was unacceptable."  Makes just as much sense.</comment>

<comment>Saddam wasn't behind 9/11 but that didn't mean he had nothing to do with it.It's a mistake to regard the Arab world as separate countries. Countries are artificial impositions there; they are tribes with flags and ideologies. The Islamism of Al Qaeda was and still is a rising tide throughout the Arab world. In his latter years, Saddam strove mightily to coopt this wave, building 50 giant mosques, displaying his piety etc. He even had a Koran written in his own blood (supposedly).What Bush was trying to was provide a different future for the Arab world besides the no-win choice between al Qaeda/ISIS and the old Stalinist dictators like Saddam.As for an official casus belli, we were spoiled with choice, as the US had been at war with Saddam since 1990. Bush made a mess of things when he listened to Tony Blair and went to the UN. If he was going to do it, he should have gone straight in.</comment>

<comment>What's 9111? Do you mean 9/11?</comment>

<comment>I mean 9111: the full date was 9/11/'01.  That date was chosen in reference to the Koran, Sura 9, Chapter 111 ("9-111") which praises religious warriors.  ("Allah hath purchased of the believers their persons and their goods; for theirs (in return) is the garden (of Paradise): they fight in His cause, and slay and are slain....")So 9111 is a more accurate term than "9/11".</comment>

<comment>Because Bush Jr. thought his dad should have done so back during Kuwait, although his cabinet was responsible for planting that seed. Basically he was looking for an excuse and told people to go out and find him one.</comment>

<comment>Basically you argue like a little child.America was left holding the bag when Saddam didn't fall after the Gulf War. America had to maintain the sanctions and the no-fly zones, while every America-hating leftist in the world claimed we were killing 500,000 Iraqi kids a year (an absurd number which if true, would have wiped out entire age cohorts). Meanwhile Saddam played hide and seek with his WMDs, and played the poor widdle victim to Left, who gladly accepted his bribes to back him up and call him an oppressed victim of Imperial America.You want to know who caused the Iraq War? Look in a mirror, lib.</comment>

<comment>Well, that's original.  Bush invaded Iraq because liberals left him no choice.  Brilliant!Do you think President Al Gore would have invaded Iraq?</comment>

<comment>Who knows what Al Gore would have done? The man is a real dummy, he would have been led by the nose by somebody.</comment>

<comment>Not sure about Gore, huh? I guess you're implying we might have been saved by Gore's stupidity!Anyway, it doesn't appear to have been a fait accompli foisted upon Bush by liberals, as you earlier suggested, if Gore could have gone in a different direction than Bush's ill-fated path.</comment>

<comment>Like Bush was led by Cheney?</comment>

<comment>You have cartoons in your head, little boy. No wonder your support Obama.</comment>

<comment>Most Republicans treat this like time travel in a bad science fiction movie, you cannot change the Flow of Time, so if Gore won in 2000  he would've somehow found himself invading Iraq anyway.  Because reasons.</comment>

<comment>So what I'm hearing is that Donald Trump was the real liar in the most recent debate? You're claiming he's a liberal plant, sent to infiltrate the GOP and plant disinformation that there were no real WMDs worth invading over?OK man, you go that route, but I tell you, those Trump fans are a bunch of neo-nazi anti semites. I didn't think you were brave enough to stand up against them</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sympathetic to the conspiracy theory that Trump is a liberal plant designed to turn the republican contest into a trainwreck. I don't think it's true by any measure, but I really can't think of a way to ratf*ck the GOP harder than he already is</comment>

<comment>You lie more than Cruz and Jeb! combined</comment>

<comment>http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12...</comment>

<comment>No the purpose was to put a divide between us and muslims in general, which invading Iraq did.  I agree that bombing Saudi Arabia would be a bad idea, instead we should have found a way to go after them economically, and to cripple their ability to fund al qaeda and other sunni terrorist groups.   In recent events, the Saudis and turkey are talking about invading syria to attack ISIS- don't be fooled, they don't plan on attacking ISIS, but on preventing syrian forces from utterly wiping ISIS off the map.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the purpose was to drive a wedge between US and Muslims generally, but specifically the Saudi Royal family.  Bin Laden hated the "westernization" of the House of Saud, and its alliance with USA was a key component of that.</comment>

<comment>Bomb Israel.</comment>

<comment>You sound like the MSM -- everybody we know thinks it, so it must be true.WMDs were chosen as the cause of war precisely because the US, British, French and German intelligence agencies agreed on them -- even though France and Germany opposed the war.For gosh sakes, go read Bob Woodward. Or read what Bill Clinton said about Saddam Hussein in 1998. The facts are well documented, but the Dem-media complex has just chosen to believe otherwise and flush contrary information down the memory hole. Now they recite "Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia" in unison.</comment>

<comment>Oh God. Here we go with the liberal corporate media again. You know, as soon as you preface an argument by claiming that the corporations that own 95% of the American media are leftist your argument is dead in the water.</comment>

<comment>Listen, Red, the corporations are very happy with left-wing government that will provide them trillions in corporate welfare. Conservatives would demand they compete in the free market.</comment>

<comment>How many times did Clinton invade Iraq again?</comment>

<comment>Clinton just responded by feckless shows of bombing, Wag the Dog style. That's what convinced Osama bin Laden that he had nothing to fear after a successful second attack on the WTC but a few cruise missiles.</comment>

<comment>That was in Afghanistan genius.  not Iraqyou keep comparing Clinton's actions to Bush's but a few bombs or cruise missiles are pretty different from a decade long occupation with over 100k troops</comment>

<comment>And trillions of dollars</comment>

<comment>In fairness, we did know that Saddam had certain WMD's, that's because we gave him chemical weapons when he was in our good graces for fighting Iran. Bush II obviously didn't want to bring up that particular plot point in his little WMD charade</comment>

<comment>Gee...ya think?</comment>

<comment>Reporting by this magazine has made it clear that the Bush Admin. "fixed the facts around the policy" (as a contemporary assessment by British intelligence put it). Bush himself did not lie (probably) but indulged in morally culpable self-deception about the merits of the case for invasion. Figures like Cheney, Rumsfeld, and their deputies probably did meet the threshold of lying, however - and at the very least, they should be indicted so that we can make a judgment on this.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.  At worst, after the enormous shock and humiliation of 9/11, Bush and his team were overwhelmingly determined never to be  caught napping again, never again to fail to connect the dots.  That's why they went the extra mile, looked under every rock, seized on even the most fragmentary and questionable evidence, distrusted soothing assurances from pro-Arab "lifers" in the State Department and intel community and insisted on seeing the raw intel, etc.</comment>

<comment>Nah, he had wanted to invade Iraq since before Nine Eleven.</comment>

<comment>You have swallowed the revisionism.  To quote from National Security Council terrorism coordinator Richard Clarke, who had been trying to warn the Bush administration about al-Quaeda since inauguration:"The first response they discussed was invading Iraq. While the Pentagon was still burning, Secretary of Defense Don Rumsfeld was in the White House suggesting an attack against Baghdad. Somehow the administration's leaders could not believe that al-Qaeda could have mounted such a devastating operation"http://www.washingtonpost.com/...See also http://www.ontheissues.org/Arc..."I expected to go back to a round of meetings [after September 11] examining what the next attacks could be, what our vulnerabilities were, what we could do about them in the short term. Instead, I walked into a series of discussions about Iraq. At first I was incredulous that we were talking about something other than getting Al Qaeda. Then I realized with almost a sharp physical pain that Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz were going to try to take advantage of this national tragedy to promote their agenda about Iraq. Since the beginning of the administration, indeed well before, they had been pressing for a war with Iraq."</comment>

<comment>Oh, please.</comment>

<comment>http://www.iraqwatch.org/persp...</comment>

<comment>Half his cabinet were people who wanted to invade Iraq again since the first warAll the same justifications too.  Plant a seed of democracy in the region and it will spread nonsense.  Their arguments barely even changed 911 just gave them the excuse</comment>

<comment>He thought he'd get away with it, obv.</comment>

<comment>Since Hillary had the same evidence and voted for the Iraq War, she lied too with your faulty logic! Of course she's a serial liar, so not a surprise if she had, but it's absurd to claim Bush lied. A mistake and bad intelligence is the truth, but Hussien was in blatant violation of UN sanctions and war could have been justified on that alone. Trump just lost SC with his left wing assault of W on Iraq and 9/11 and probably the nomination. </comment>

<comment>Your attempt to change the subject is noted but it's a fail - nice try. The problem with you right-wingers is that you'll always fail to notice the truth even if it hits you in the face.</comment>

<comment>I was right on target, but it's an inconvenient truth you hate to admit. </comment>

<comment>Yeah, you're "on target" just like W's "Mission Accomplished" banner - an embarrassing fail.</comment>

<comment>You mean Obama and Bidens celebration of winning Iraq and how it would be the administrations greatest accomplishment? Lmao. </comment>

<comment>No change of subject at all. Nearly all the leading Dems in Congress voted for the Iraq War. But when it became unpopular, they thought they could use it to win the 2004 election. But how to cover their butts for their own support of it? "WE WUZ DUPED!" they wailed in unison, starting in June 2004 (though they had seen the exact same intelligence as Bush). They also waxed hot with phony outrage over the "outing" of Valerie Plame.It was all an election year ploy, a premeditated falsehood.That was the last time the Dems even pretended to care about national security. They certainly don't give a damn about Hillary's massive intelligence spillage. 1666 classified emails on her non-secured server...and still counting.</comment>

<comment>Clinton's speech at the time made it clear that she wanted the UN inspections to finish and reveal the truth about WMD's. She stated that the resolution was a threat of force to prevent Saddam from stopping them as he had done before.Bush ignored that provision and expelled the UN to start the war before his lies on WMD's could be exposed.</comment>

<comment>She voted for it and that's campaign revisionist history. She has a lot more damaging issues to deal with at the moment well beyond WMD at this point. I was only mentioning it to point out that the Iraq war was declared by Congress on a bipartisan basis. </comment>

<comment>The speech is on the record, as is the text of the resolution. It not revisionist. Bush should have been impeached for 9/11 and then for that invasion but it would have been politically impossible.  </comment>

<comment>bush pardoned himself, just google thathttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>He deserves worse than impeachment. He should spend the rest of his life in a cell.</comment>

<comment>The decision to invade Iraq is one thing. Bush's actual invasion and occupation are another. Bush can't blame his failed occupation on anyone other than himself and Republicans can't hang that failure on the senators who voted for the war. Hillary Clinton didn't de-Ba'athisize Iraq, she didn't fire the Iraqi army, she didn't foment a civil war between Shia and Sunnis and she didn't elevate Nouri al Maliki from complete obscurity to 'president' of Iraq.You can keep going on about who said what about evidence at the time. Bush presented that evidence to congress to get the war he wanted. Bush then invaded Iraq and f@#ked it all up. On Point A, there's little room to hide. On point B, there is NO room to hide.</comment>

<comment>The Republican doublethink after the Iraq debacle reminds me of the movie "Air America" where a US Air Force officer tries to assure a contract pilot that, since Nixon assured the world the US government had no force in Laos, a US military air crash on an air base in Laos hadn't happened. The contract gestures at the dead victim of the crash as says: "Maybe it didn't happen for you or Nixon, but I'm pretty sure it happened for Doug."A reckoning, with the cost the loss of life, the knock-on consequences of Bush's ruinous policies is long overdue. It appears to have arisen at a very very embarrassing time for the current US Republican Party.</comment>

<comment>It cost her the presidency once, and it might again.</comment>

<comment>Bush lied, Hillary lied, Kerry lied, Cheney lied. They all lied. Do you really think Senate Democrats didn't know there were no WMDs? Do you thing Cheney didn't know there were no WMDs? Ron Paul was against the war. He suspected it would be a waste of time. Why didn't other Congressmen? They were all in on it.</comment>

<comment>I think there was too much political pressure to go to war but you are correct that people like Rand Paul, Barack Obama and Bernie Sanders were courageous enough to resist that pressure. But the answer to your question is that Democrats only knew what the administration told them and the administration was lying.</comment>

<comment>I meant Ron Paul, I don't know about Rand. Obama SAYS he was against it, but I have yet to see any proof of that. He was so much against the war that both his Secretaries of State voted for it (Hillary and Kerry). And I guess this is ONE thing I agree with Sanders on...well, that and the fact that our politicians are bought and sold (we see the same problem, but have different solutions. Cruz said so himself, even). And Trump was against the Iraq War too. And it was obvious there were no WMDs in Iraq. Like I said, why did people like Paul see right through it but the rest of Congress didn't? Either they're all morons (highly possible) or they were in on it. Both parties. It wasn't easy to be against the war as a conservative back then...that's the reason I voted for Paul in 2008 and 2012. We both stuck by our conservative values against the neocons.</comment>

<comment>Ron Paul had the same information, and didn't "see through it" he's an isolationist who is against any foreign involvement. He's really not that smart or prescient.</comment>

<comment>He's against over involvment in foreign affair. He's against getting into fights where we have no dog in said fight. He's against nation building. He's against toppling governments. Are you in favor of that? If so, what do we get out of it? Don't come to me with "oh, but the people were oppressed!". I don't care. I want an AMERICAN President who puts AMERICAN interests above ANYTHING. Anyone who wants to be overly involved in foreign affairs does not get my vote, period. Never will.</comment>

<comment>I may not be a redneck but I'm with you 110%.</comment>

<comment>Well you don't need to be a redneck lol. Just have common sense.</comment>

<comment>I apologize, I meant Ron Paul. Obama was not in the Senate yet but was very vocal against the war.</comment>

<comment>Well then Obama's a hypocrite because he did the exact same crap in Libya.</comment>

<comment>Obama sent tens of thousands of troops into Libya based on claims that they had weapons of mass destruction? Why didn't I hear about this?</comment>

<comment>The same nonsense of intervening in a country's internal problems leaving instability behind. I don't care if he justified it differently or if we just bombed it. The result was the same. And then there was Benghazi after that.</comment>

<comment>Trump's opposition against the Iraq war prior to the invasion is about a credible and 4,500,000 of the 5 million who were at Woodstock.</comment>

<comment>??? Are you saying Trump not being for the war ain't credible? Based on what?</comment>

<comment>On the basis of no contemporaneous reporting of him saying anything about invading Iraq prior to the invasion. Whatever he thought or felt, or remembers, or imagines what he thought or felt, he did not go to any length, take any public stand, make any noise in opposition to the war.</comment>

<comment>Repeated fact checks have verified that the only records of Trump opposing the invasion of Iraq came after it had already happened. He was strongly opposed to it quite a while before the majority of the country but it was still after the fact.</comment>

<comment>Well, he wasn't in politics, so he probably wasn't asked about it. Doesn't mean he didn't oppose it. And as soon as he had a chance, he came out against it. He even supported impeaching Bush (he kinda lost me there, what do you want, President Cheney and VP Pelosi?), and he has yet to back down from those statements.</comment>

<comment>Trump went on the record in the summer of 2004, exactly when all the other leading Democrats turned on a dime against the war.</comment>

<comment>Obama was in the Illinois State Senate at the time.</comment>

<comment>The Bush administration stirred up the war fever and the only intelligence gathering the feckless congress was concerned with was their polling on public opinion.</comment>

<comment>How could anybody know there were no WMDs when Saddam acted guilty as hell and the CIA swore there were WMDs?To this day we don't know what was in Iraq in 2001. Remember, by going to the UN, Bush gave Saddam 14 months warning. During that time, hundreds of truck convoys went to Syria. Assad certainly has no shortage of poison gas.</comment>

<comment>"To this day we don't know what was in Iraq in 2001"You don't commit thousands of American troops to a war if you "don't know what was in Iraq in 2001"!!! We need to ALWAYS remember all the families that lost sons, daughters, fathers, mothers, brothers, friends, for "faulty intelligence".</comment>

<comment>Hillary had the same evidence that the Bush administration made up. I don't think this is even debated any more. You are right, though that Hillary should have been able to see through the lies as both Obama and Sanders did.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is right of Trump on Iraq and the ME. </comment>

<comment>True. I'm a Democrat and not a Hillary supporter. She is no liberal and is most definitely a hawk. Outside of Paul who dropped out, Trump is the most reasonable of the Republican field on international relations and at least he is not a hypocrite about Iraq.</comment>

<comment>Interesting view and I certainly would vote for Trump over Hillary or the Socialist. Trump however is not my first choice as I prefer Rubio then Kasich. </comment>

<comment>The Bush administration acted on the bad intelligence the CIA gave them. Tenet swore it was a "slam-dunk case."That's why the CIA set out to destroy Bush. Somebody had to take the fall for the bad intelligence, and it wasn't going to be them</comment>

<comment>That's an interesting slant on the situation. It was a little more like the CIA was goaded into backing up the administration and later admitted they had not had any proof. If we could have an investigation we might be able to figure out who blew it but I'm not holding my breath - are you?</comment>

<comment>But the CIA wasn't goaded. Tenet was right out front persuading Bush that he had a "slam dunk case." Bob Woodward (not a partisan conservative) has chronicled the discussions. At this time the British, French and German intelligence agencies said exactly the same thing. Saddam's own generals thought he had WMD -- and why wouldn't they? Saddam had a track record of not only having, but using WMD on the Iranians and the Kurds.</comment>

<comment>That doesn't even make sense moron. Hillary, and every Senator, was given lies by Bush, Cheney, and Rice. She herself didn't lie about anything. Thefcuk are you talking about??</comment>

<comment>You say lies partisan. Lies like Obama spins about the cut and run in Iraq despite Panetta saying we easily could have stayed had Obama committed a sizable force. </comment>

<comment>The Senate Foreign Intelligence Committee (Hillary & Kerry) saw the same evidence Bush got. Exactly the same.They just started lying about when they decided to do a 180 on Iraq in 2004. That's when the Dems began working hard to make us lose.</comment>

<comment>99% of Republicans in Congress voted for the Iraq war, only 45% of Dems did.  ALL of them were misled by biased reports filtered through Bush's cabinet team.According to PolitiFact, Hillary Clinton tells the truth 71.5% of the time (Sanders only slightly less), and the GOP presidental front runners tell the truth less than 35% of the time (Cruz 34.2%, Trump 22.8%).</comment>

<comment>Politifact is staffed by liberal Dems, what do you expect.</comment>

<comment>It was not a mistake. It was deliberate. The Bush administration told the intelligence to find evidence, any evidence, to support invading Iraq. They ignored the many, many people who said it was a bad idea, and worse, they implied that anyone opposing the war was a traitor.  Bush will go down in history as one of the most despicable war criminals in American history.</comment>

<comment>Oh, please.  You claim that a Senator, who was assured that the invasion would be on hold until the WMD inspections were finished, and who then voted to allow GWB to invade Iraq as long as those provisions were honored, is more culpable than the sitting President who called himself The Decider, who agreed to honor the provision of waiting, but who then ignored that provision and invaded anyway?  Wow!</comment>

<comment>I think you missed my point. </comment>

<comment>Yep, it was Hillary Clinton's fault that W invaded Iraq!</comment>

<comment>The worst part is folks saying he ain't conservative because of what he said. News flash: wasting billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of american lives in a useless war IS NOT conservative! Neocons have been trying to redefine conservatism ever since they infiltrated the party, and they need to go! We need to go back to fiscal responsibility, protecting American lives, having a steady hand in foreign policy, etc. I'm not saying Trump is the guy, but he stood WAY above the rest of the pack (except for Cruz) in that instance.</comment>

<comment>News flash from all of history: war is an expensive & risky bet. Lost wars are ALWAYS a bad bargain.Had Bush's victory been maintained (and yes, it was a victory, costly and partial as it was), there would be no ISIS and probably no Syrian civil war either.</comment>

<comment>Had Bush picked a team that understood the first thing about occupying a ME country the outcome might have been different. The damage done by the team he sent post invasion was irreversible by the time President Obama was sworn in.</comment>

<comment>Funny, then, that the Obama administration spent its first three years boasting of Iraq as a success. What was not irreversible, unfortunately, was the stable Iraq that Obama inherited from Bush.Boy every other politician on Earth would like to get Obama's Teflon. Seven years of disaster, and it's STILL Bush's fault -- everything is Bush's fault, the bad economy, the world in flames, you name it. Obama is never responsible for anything!</comment>

<comment>What I don't understand is why it was so important that Saddam fell (he mostly kept the peace in Iraq and contained Iran), and why it is so important that Assad falls now. If Assad falls, we're gonna have Iraq and Libya all over again, only this time with the russians saying "I told you so". And our respectability (is that even a word?) as a nation would keep falling after another foreign policy f-ck up.</comment>

<comment>What do you mean, Saddam kept the peace? He repeatedly invaded the neighbors, when he wasn't slaughtering the Kurds and the Shia.</comment>

<comment>Inside his country. After the Gulf War, I don't think he was particularly likely to try anything again. If he did, THEN we could have gone in. And regime change is usually a stupid idea. Do you think that going in and toppling a government and replacing it with SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY is just easy? No, it's not. And sorry, but how does it affect America that he was slaughtering the Kurds and the Shia? We're not the world's police. Using taxpayer dollars and American lives to "protect" (ask them now how safe they feel) foreigners is dumb and wrong.</comment>

<comment>What victory?</comment>

<comment>One of the political pundits on TV this morning argued that Trump was mistaken to say this before the South Carolina primary, where many view the war favorable.   Nobody batted an eye at the blatant presumption that everything every politician says is pandering to what somebody wants to hear, and the only question is whether they gauged their audience correctly.  Trump and Sanders are a huge breath of fresh air.  We need a president to lead, not follow, now more than ever.</comment>

<comment>It was a mistake because Trump repeated one of the lies of the Left. Bush did not deliberately lie about WMDs. They know this in South Carolina, where 1 in 5 of Republican primary voters is a veteran.Trump is free to say the war was a mistake, which after Obama's fp went down in flames and lost Iraq, nobody can deny. But repeating slanders about GW Bush, who is well respected in SC, will win him no friends.</comment>

<comment>Bush totally lied about the wmd threat I'm sorry</comment>

<comment>That is a Democrat slander. Bush used the intelligence the CIA gave him. The exact same intelligence that Hillary and Kerry saw when they voted for the Iraq war.But in June 2004, the Demos needed to cover their asses for their support of the Iraq War. So they turned on a dime and began wailing "WE WUZ DUPED!"Dems lied, people died.</comment>

<comment>Bush looked for the intelligence that fit his narrative.  thats why Ahmed Chalabi was his priamry for of information.</comment>

<comment>Sure he did.  He was looking for an excuse to invade Iraq from the day he took office.  It may not have been a lie to repeat the intelligence estimates that were most favorable to his aims.  It was a lie to argue that was the reason we must invade Iraq, which had be pre-ordained.  In retrospect, even if the WMD intelligence had been correct, invading was the wrong way to address that issue.It will win him friends among people who respect honesty.</comment>

<comment>The CIA gave Bush the data he wanted to see. That gave him the proper cover to say it wasn't a knowing lie.</comment>

<comment>Except he's totally full of it when he says he always opposed the war </comment>

<comment>There are still portions of the 9/11 report that are redacted because of possible Saudi ties.</comment>

<comment>David Frum is one of the more moderate Republicans in recent history. His is a dying breed as the GOP takes the cray train over the cliff. I used to be a Republican but the party decided that governing wasn't a worthy goal and began to pursue a policy of intentional sabotage to cripple the ability of government to function properly. To retain political power, the GOP entered into a death embrace with the far right Evangelical Christians on social issues and the extreme anti-government Libertarians on the role of governing. Now this toxic brew has bubbled up to contaminate the party's ability to function. All the GOP can offer now is fear and anger. As much as I disliked Dubya, he at least tried for the hope aspect of governing. Now the GOP has ditched the whole hope thing going all in on fear mongering. I remain dubious that the Republican Party will find its way back from crazy town anytime soon. They need to be taken to the woodshed by the electorate to impress upon them the need to reform their reprobate ways.</comment>

<comment>The supreme irony is that Obama is in very general (no pun) terms, closest to an Eisenhower republican, and look how they treat him! Like they turned into zombies or something. I would offer two explanations: 1. he's black and the smartest guy in the room...really tough to look down on if your IQ is ballpark normal. His distracted, thoughtful aloofness is translated as "uppity", and we're off to the races. 2. Fox News and right wing radio, where no one is responsible for what they say/distort, and only ratings count, based on working the listeners into a froth. Time was, we got reasonably balanced news from the big 3 networks to start the day. Even those who disagreed, and ran to their special sources for news, at least had a sense of what we all were working from. Today, the right wing is offered pure political masturbation with no reality checks from the likes of Walter Cronkite or Huntley Brinkley. Now we're feral.</comment>

<comment>I agree, historically speaking Obama would be in line with moderate Republicans or conservative Democrats. The right-wing corporate media/entertainment industry paints him as a Marxist/Socialist/Secret Muslim who is either too weak to lead our country or is so strong that he is sending in the Black Helicopters with UN Troops to round up God fearing White 'Muricans and put them in FEMA reeducation camps. They vacillate on how they want to portray him. The one salient point they want to hammer home is that Obama is different from the average American and can't be trusted. I get frustrated with Obama's calm, measured tone but I understand that America can't handle an angry black man as their President. So he channels much more of Spock rather than going Kirk on these obstructionist Republicans. I'm old enough to remember when we had three reliable sources for news brought to us each evening. Even the early days of CNN were excellent as they worked hard to bring us multiple perspectives on world events like during Gulf War I. When Reagan ended the Fairness Doctrine, evidence-based journalism became de-emphasized as networks cut their budgets. Finally, the independent news departments were absorbed into the entertainment side of the broadcasting business and it became a chase for ratings. Fox News didn't even pretend to be objective as Roger Ailes wanted a Republican Party Propaganda outlet that advanced the right-wing narrative. This coincided with the rise of right-wing hate talk radio where partisans like Rush Limbaugh, Neal Boortz, Hugh Hewitt, Laura Ingraham, Alex Jones, etc., all battled to see who could push the envelope the furthest on appealing to the extreme conservative Republican base. They developed an alternate reality that would have felt very familiar to George Orwell or Joseph Goebbels. Just keep repeating the big lie over and over and people will come to believe. The more outrageous the lie, the more likely people are to accept it as gospel. It's confirmation bias run amok. The GOP will have to implode and allow the adults to pick through the ruins to rebuild what was once a proud and meaningful political party. Right now, they are in a race to the bottom and no one is willing to hit the brakes.</comment>

<comment>Yes. Rs are schizophrenic about him. Evidenced by Micro insisting he was devious and brilliant in his scheming to destroy the republic and the others equally insistant that he's a bumbling fool. Priceless. It depends if you are a callow first term senator trying to justify your candidacy or you are a crusty governor going after him, traditionally, as a boob. They project all their hopes and fears on him, and he just looks back at them with a wry smile, and shakes his head. Drives them berserk. Wait'll he nominates Sri to the SCOTUS. Brilliant moderate who was unanimously confirmed to the circuit court by the senate. They'll throw there backs out contorting the reason for obstruction. </comment>

<comment>Because nothing says "Eisenhower Republican" like racking up $10 Trillion in debt?</comment>

<comment>As always, you offer nothing worth reading.  It's a comment from a willful ignoramus.  It's a comment worthy of a 6th grader, not an adult.You simply do not belong here.</comment>

<comment>Who knew Trump was a Code Pink man?</comment>

<comment>The argument between Trump and his supporters and the GOP mainstream isn't about the George W. Bush presidency--it's about whether the blue-collar and business wings of the Republican party can negotiate a common platform when their interests are in profound conflict. The Democratic party elite long ago figured out how to pay off their lower-class minority constituents with racial preferences and incendiary rhetoric. The GOP had been doing something similar by embracing blue-collar cultural values, but post-economic-crisis, culture has taken a back seat to economic concerns.  That Trump's supporters are sticking with him despite his bizarre behavior is a testament to the depth of this internal schism.  Whoever ends up leading the GOP will have their work cut out for them resolving it. (More here: http://icouldbewrong.blogspot.... )</comment>

<comment>Trump supporters just want to hear more racist shyt. Trump has dispatched white supremacy groups to robocall on his behalf.</comment>

<comment>The white supremes the groups are no doubt all in for Trump. However I think the jury is out on whether he is actively directing it or passively accepting it. He is probably the most reasonable Klown in the Klown car though.</comment>

<comment>This is why Santorum's muzzling by the RNC and Fox is such a self-destructive act.  Santorum's program is for the large part compatible with the donors and business interests, but he wrote "Blue Collar Conservative", his tax plan explicitly favored domestic manufacturing, and he had demonstrated appeal to the Rust Belt and Midwest blue collar whites who did not believe McCain or Romney were on their side economically.As Mickey Kaus has said, the GOP elite and Fox is fanatically clinging to amnesty at the cost of everything else.  If they had let that go they would have gotten everything else they wanted.</comment>

<comment>Don't say "Santorum"!  Give him his true name, which is "Man-on-Dog".</comment>

<comment>A 1950s conservative warning that laws against racial discrimination would lead to "gay marriage" would have been accused of paranoid slanderous demagoguery, and shunned for even mentioning homosexuality, which was regarded across the spectrum as unspeakably disgusting perversion.</comment>

<comment>Last night, Trump proved how easy it is to get under his skin. World leaders are taking note, and will have a field day if by some slim chance he wins the presidency.</comment>

<comment>At this point I'm beginning to believe Trump would be worth it if he destroyed movement conservatism for good.</comment>

<comment>We need to "burn down the village in order to save it."</comment>

<comment>It took about 30 seconds for Senator McConnell to turn Justice Scalia's death into a political sideshow.  He and the other Senators were to be legislators and to perform the duties outlined in the Constitution, not to be political party operatives whose only job is to play political games.  We appear to be descending into some sort of mob rule...just look at the Republican debate. The candidates and the crowd can't even be civil to fellow party members.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think that the Founders' original intent was to obstruct for a year, Senator McConnell?</comment>

<comment>McConnell is under intense pressure.  The Cruz and Trump candidacies are fueled in part by a base enraged by the idea that the GOP congressional leadership is supine and easily rolled by Obama.  If McConnell had said nothing he'd have been besieged by demands he comment, and any delay or silence would have been portrayed and perceived as more weakness or even active behind-the-scenes plotting to hand Obama another victory, further boosting Cruz and Trump.  If McConnell had actually talked in anything like a conciliatory fashion or expressed openness to an Obama nominee, it would have been gasoline on a fire that in part is directed at McConnell himself.</comment>

<comment>McConnell reaps what he sows.  He could have said he'd talk about politics after Justice Scalia was decently buried or at least till after the 3 day weekend. Some sign of basic decency is called for.</comment>

<comment>Well, that's the GOP problem right there.  They are ruled by the right wing media that ultimately cares most about ratings.  Or, are you picturing the rank and file base spontaneously rising up with outrage if McConnell said nothing?</comment>

<comment>I'm not convinced the crowd was angry so much as it was a bunch of cheerleaders. Really obnoxious. This is a debate, not a convention. The moderator should have stopped it.</comment>

<comment>It was an absolutely disgusting display.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>These guys who wrap themselves in "constitution", "liberty", "patriot" like no one else has a claim ought to check out Federalist 10 on the perfidy of factions. Yikes! I know what the Founders would have thought of that debate.</comment>

<comment>Frum is right about the dysfunction of the Republican field, but he's wrong in suggesting that the party's long-term viability was better served by refusing to air disagreements about the Bush years. There are huge swathes of the GOP, especially in what passes for its intelligentsia, who have learned exactly nothing from the disasters of that administration, above all the Iraq debacle, and those people need to be discredited before the GOP will be anything approaching a decent governing party. Grotesque as he is, I appreciate Trump breaking down the taboos surrounding the poisoned legacy of 2001-2008.</comment>

<comment>Trump is killing all the GOPe's Sacred Cows.General Patton said, "Sacred Cows taste the best."</comment>

<comment>In many ways, the Republicans HAVE been wrestling with George W Bush's failed presidency and its legacy for the past 8 years. The Tea Party was effectively a rebranding operation - an attempt by Republicans to claim that, while they wanted the exact same things, they were somehow divorced from Bush's presidency and by extension its failures. In 2012, Mitt Romney couldn't bring himself to call invading Iraq a mistake but he never called it a success either. He danced around the issue and Romney was a skilled and savvy politicians and professional flip-flopper.This years crop of candidates lacks Romney's gravitas or skill but facing the same dilemma (wanting to sew up the 'Party of Bush' while being apart from its legacy and stink) they end up looking like a bunch of people doing their best to ignore an elephant in the room. Donald Trump is saying what every Republican basically agrees with but doesn't want to say out loud or even think in their heads. George W Bush's presidency was an unmitigated disaster. Invading Iraq was a terrible idea and the way he went about invading and occupying Iraq was even worse. The economy remains soft and well below the expectations of Americans and that too is a product of terrible Bush policies. Its hard - perhaps even impossible - to distance yourself from Bush and embrace him at the same time. Naturally what you get is a food fight and a lot of pi$$ed off Republicans voters who are going to be unhappy no matter who the nominee is. Their only hope is to run against someone they hate even more and hope that hate galvanizes the party.</comment>

<comment>The Republican front runner came out with guns blazing in support of Planned Parenthood, in support of Government seizure of private property, in full support of universal government healthcare "better than Obamacare". He supports higher taxes, and supports Nancy Pelosi, (who he gets along with fabulously), in believing that Dubya should have been impeached. In fact, Trump is a borderline 911 truther.Bernie - HRC - Trump... The Democrats are running three candidates.Democrats cant lose either way.</comment>

<comment>Except for that little bitty problem of stinking fascist nationalism.</comment>

<comment>Trump may have just lost not only South Carolina, but the nomination with his far left talking points about George W. Saying W lied about WMD as opposed to making a mistake, will not sit well in SC nor the base. Then going on to say 9/11 was his as well and impeachment at a GOP debate will finally implode The Donald. Rubio breaks through this week. </comment>

<comment>Trump's numbers will go even higher.George W. Bush is an embarrassment.</comment>

<comment>I'm not defending Bush, but Trump blew it and why? There was little to be gained by going after Jeb at this point and then slandering George W in front of the GOP base. What's the upside? Zero! Downside? HUge.</comment>

<comment>Upside is to blunt W.'s effectiveness campaigning for Deb! in SC.Trump opened a can of worms and imbued the notion in people that W. wasn't only a bad POTUS, but had ulterior motives as to why we invaded Iraq........ think PNAC.Another thing Trump is setting up is the obliteration of the GOPe Apparatus.He's going to make them defend the indefensible Iraq War and the resulting disaster that is the Middle East.Trump is the only guy running that's not a blood thirsty warmonger and therefore clearly distinguishes himself from the other 5 candidates.He's up by 20-22 points in the polls in SC and can afford to lose a couple in order to win the long game.What he said has massive crossover appeal for the General Election as Hillary is a NeoCon.</comment>

<comment>All true. But I cannot imagine he is that strategic. More like off the cuff telling it how it is. Refreshing.</comment>

<comment>You should read Scott Adam's Blog and his 'Master Persuader Series' on Trump.Here's the blog  - http://blog.dilbert.com/Here's the background on how Trump persuades people in a 3 dimensional way.http://blog.dilbert.com/post/1...</comment>

<comment>Trump is very strategic. Don't let his style fool you.</comment>

<comment>Upvote for "Deb!" I'm still chuckling. Well-played, sir.</comment>

<comment>Thats a huge stretch Heinrich and I don't think blaming W for 9/11 and accusing Bush of lying will net any additional votes from the far left which are about the only folks that actually believe those sentiments. You sir are talking your position!</comment>

<comment>anything to left of far right crazy is far left to you, kid</comment>

<comment>Not true and I'm no far right idealogue by any means. </comment>

<comment>Because Trump does not calculate how best to pander, he says what he believes.  I don't think this is any special integrity.  He just stumbled into it, it worked, so he keeps doubling down.</comment>

<comment>South Carolina is an open primary. Trump is pursuing working class Democrat and independent voters.</comment>

<comment>far left?? damn, that's funny, dumb as hell but funny</comment>

<comment>To say 9/11 was GWB fault is an extreme position only a left zealot would hold. </comment>

<comment>the problem is all the warnings he had leadingup to 9/11 that he ignored, that's a fact</comment>

<comment>Bush had eight months of warnings, none of them actionable.Clinton had five years of warning, including offers from the government of Sudan to turn bin Laden over. He did nothing.</comment>

<comment>is that what fox news told you?</comment>

<comment>You mean "left zealots" like the writers of the American Conservative?http://www.theamericanconserva...</comment>

<comment>It's a beautiful thing to watch. Trump, most awesome Trojan Horse ever.</comment>

<comment>Trump's trashing of first McCain and now Bush makes it clear that his is a hostile takeover of the Republican Party, and he is saying to its various governing elites--You're Fired.If he gets the nomination on these terms it will be a different party. This suggests that if he does get the majority of delegates, the rest of the party will walk out and nominate an independent to run against him.</comment>

<comment>Good. The GOPe is corrupt to the core.An insurgency is taking place and we will win.Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>If there is a conservative independent candidate, Clinton or Sanders will win. Unless the vote goes to the House, then the  conservative will win.</comment>

<comment>That's what they said about Reagan in 1980 when Republican John Anderson ran as an Independent.Try again.</comment>

<comment>This isn't then. The independent would be running with the help of the regular Republicans at all levels and with all that money can buy. Maybe, Romney/Ryan.</comment>

<comment>You're delusional.</comment>

<comment>Do you think Romney/Ryan in a three way race with Trump and either Clinton or Sanders would win any states? Trump maxes out at 35% of Republicans/independents.</comment>

<comment>Romney/Ryan ticket is a proven loser.They might get 10% of the vote.Trump will more then make up for that with Reagan Democrats through the Rust Belt and the South.</comment>

<comment>Whose votes would they get? Trump's or Clinton/Sanders?(I think they would get 35% in some states and win 6-12 which would be enough to put the election into the House where they would win.)</comment>

<comment>They'd get GOPe votes which is about 10% of the party, not one Dem.</comment>

<comment>If they win some states then no one gets a majority and the House of Representatives decides--which means they win.</comment>

<comment>reagan democrats, damn you kids are too funny</comment>

<comment>kids?How old are you?</comment>

<comment>hey, goober, republicans are so afraid of crazy man cruzthey'd rather trump lose to hillary than give cruza shot at hillary or be first in line for 2020they know trump will lose, it seems your one ofthe fools who don't get it</comment>

<comment>How old are you?</comment>

<comment>obviously more grown up than you kid</comment>

<comment>I thought Trump maxed out at 25%? Oh wait, that was last year.</comment>

<comment>I think it will be the same party and after Trump they'll go back to voting for the type of candidates Republicans always vote for. Conservatives are, by nature, a group that always returns to what they know. Conservatives prefer simplicity and clarity to exciting new political ideas. George W Bush's presidency is such a dilemma for Republicans specifically because it went against what conservatives see themselves as being for. Open-ended wars, much less two of them, ballooning deficits and financial sector meltdowns are not what Republicans want on their resume. Remember Bob Dole going on about 'Democrat Wars'? So they'll simply erase those heresies and in four years they'll be looking for Ronald Reagan 5.0 - not Donald Trump's heir.</comment>

<comment>I think they will want Trump to lose if nominated so as not to lose control of the message and appointments and so forth. He would be a wild card in a way that even the Tea Party has not been. And the current owners of the party do not give up. They have resources and willingness to do whatever it takes, in my opinion. The test will be if there is any talk of Trump maybe being acceptable after this episode.</comment>

<comment>Well, Trump, assuming he gets the nomination, can throw a few bones and few slabs of red meat around and probably keep the party from openly revolting. He can pick a good VP nominee and that would go a long way towards more or less unifying the party. Ted Cruz behind him in the polls actually helps Trump because most establishment Republicans hate Cruz far more than Trump and that includes McCain whom Trump insulted. Ted Cruz is the @$$holes' @$$hole. If Bush was the guy everyone wanted to do a backyard barbecue with, Ted Cruz is pretty much the last guy on Planet Earth anyone wants on their property. Both guys will more than likely loose a general election unless the Democrats nominate Bernie Sanders. Sanders would instantly galvanize the Republicans and Trump could call Bush a rapist and come out as gay and no Republicans would care. They'd all show up to save America from socialism.In the end, its not who you are that counts - its who you're running against.</comment>

<comment>I agree the party hates Cruz and has been divided over whether Trump is acceptable if he can win. I think Trump is upping the anti and making it clear he expects them to grovel if he gets the nomination. I bet lot of the oligarchs behind the scenes are probably saying I can buy and sell Trump ten times over and I don't have to take him on his terms.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is for sale if ever a guy was. You could buy that guy off for a half million dollars. Donald Trump is hard to buy off because he has a long history of walking away from contracts, declaring bankruptcy, lawsuits and counter-lawsuits and being a general deadbeat. He's also a clinical narcissist so any agreement you make with him is about as reliable as a deal with Loki.The oligarchs in this country are as unhappy as everyone else these days, having to spend more of their hard earned money for less just like the little people. They too are lamenting the old days when you bought a politician off and he stayed bought and you could rig an election for the price of a luxury car. In a way, Trump has unified the country into being grumpy and pi$$ed off all the time together.</comment>

<comment>There was a saying-- I bought that guy but he didn't stay bought.Trump isn't really really rich and he is looked down upon for his pretensions. There is plenty of money to pay for an independent candidate. If that seems their best option my guess is that is what they will do.</comment>

<comment>If Hillary is the nominee on the D side, they have little to lose. One can be assured that she'll keep the country steady-as-she-goes.If Bernie is nominated, though ... all bets are off!</comment>

<comment>I think the old guard would run an independent if Cruz or Trump gets the nomination and Sanders does too, hoping to put the contest into the House if no candidate wins a majority of electoral votes. The Republicans would win there for sure.</comment>

<comment>I like most of your analyses here, but what do you see as the battle cry against Sanders?  I think the tax issue may have lost its potency, when nearly half of Americans pay no income tax, and wages have been stagnant.  Not sure they will keep buying the trickle down arguments after seeing how rapidly Wall Street was back to business as usual while Main Street still struggles.  I have heard very little talk about taxes on the Republican side.  Or, what else would get people to rise up against Sanders?  Fear of terrorism would be a big mover if we have another significant event, but if 2016 remains peaceful, not so much.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders would represent to Republicans the embodiment of leftist 60's radicalism. 'Socialism' I understand is not a bad word among liberals. Its practically 'lucifer' to Republicans. To moderate-independent ears, it sounds like bad news. The polling data is clear on this just based on word association alone. Dig deeper and with Sanders you see a guy using a lot of 60's vernacular - 'establishment', unions, replaying the Kissinger/Nixon food fight - and he's 74 years old with a floppy, stoned-professor look. So far, we're just talking sound and optics here.A billion dollars of Koch-cash can turn this man into a ready made caricature of the 60's New Left.With Sanders, his background reveals a guy who dabbed in youthful neo-communism and college campus, new age theory stuff. That's where the (soon to be) famous "women fantasize about rape" comments come from. Its actually totally understandable and involves campus research on gender role issues - BUT come on man! That quote combined with that look and that background and that 60's bull$#!T and you have a guy who makes George McGovern look like Chuck Norris.Finally there's the simple analysis of his voting record. He's not the rock solid principles-man he claims to be. In 1994, facing the coming Republicans midterm landslide, Sanders pivoted hard right on the gun issue to keep his house seat. He voted against background checks and waiting periods for handguns - practical, completely constitutional gun control measures - and managed to barely hang on and win reelection. In 2008, he voted against the Bank Bailout. That looks good to his supporters but its disaster in the general election. When Sanders voted against that bailout bill, the economy was in free fall. There was a very real possibility of a bank run and absolute ruin for the economy. Sanders chose to grandstand over duty to his country. That vote WILL come back to haunt him if he makes it to the general.I can't stress what a poor choice for Democratic nominee Bernie Sanders would be. There's a lot to admire him for but he'd lose badly and the county would suffer for it.</comment>

<comment>I think you are neglecting the significance of the worst recession since the Great Depression.  Half the 2016 voters will have been born after 1970.  The defining events of their lives have been the rise of the Internet, war in the Middle East, and the economic collapse of 2008.  Republicans have traditionally managed to divert attention away from declining middle class fortunes toward big government inefficiency or unrelated cultural issues, but I don't believe that will fly when so many people watched how quickly Wall Street bounced back to business as usual while they still struggled.  That is what is driving Trump's popularity.  People are pissed off.  If anything, Sanders vote against the bailout will be a positive for him in the general election.  We could have bailed out the bank customers rather than the banks.  That will play well to the people who lost their homes and/or retirement savings.  It will play especially well in the Rust Belt swing states--Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin--that will probably decide the election.  The economies of California and New York have bounced back nicely, but they will go Democratic in any case.I see Sanders as a hard leftist on economic issues, but more of a libertarian than typical Democrats on most other issues.  He may have a hard time getting the nomination, but will be a stronger candidate in the general election.  I also think his non-pandering authenticity will be a big draw, like we are seeing with Trump.  Participation in social media has made people a lot more savvy about how easily an image can be manufactured, and how different it may be from reality.  They would rather support someone who they disagree with on 30% of the issues, than someone who says everything they want to hear but they suspect is actually driven by back room deals.</comment>

<comment>You're kind of revealing Bernie Sanders weakness in your pitch for his strengths. His strengths as a candidate are predicated on the assumption that he's high minded, principled and goes with his convictions over the prevailing political winds. But in a general elections, there will be NO assumption that he is impeccably honest. No one really knows the guy outside of Democratic circles and it won't be hard to use his rape comments, his 1994 gun vote and his 2008 bailout vote to cast into serious doubt his honesty, judgement and character.You're assuming that a billion dollars worth of negative advertising can have no impact on a man's reputation. You're assuming young voters aren't easily swayed by lies, misleading adds and general bull$#!T politics. If Sanders is the nominee, there's no guarantee the young voters flocking to him now will be there in November. You can guarantee the conservative and moderate voters Obama and Clinton attracted will NOT be there. Bernie Sanders would struggle to carry California and New York and very likely lose to ANY Republican by a wide margin. I know its not what Sanders supporters want to hear, but it looks obvious to me.</comment>

<comment>I really knew little about him until I watched a few of his recent speeches.  His policy prescriptions are easy to understand:  medicare for all, free K-16 education, break up the big banks, raise taxes on the rich, avoid foreign intervention.  With most politicians, including Clinton, it is not too hard to imagine they could just as easily make a speech for the opposing view.  Sanders speaks with a passion that makes him totally believable.  It is probably not wise to elect a president on gut level assessments, but a good portion of the electorate does exactly that.  And the kind of media that drives it--quotes, images, sound bites--is spread easily by social media.  Republicans spent more than 60 million on TV advertising in New Hampshire, almost all of that by Bush, Rubio, Christie and Kasich.  Mainstream media pundits have been discounting Trump and Sanders ever since they appeared on the scene, and they just keep rising in popularity.The rape comment, gun vote, and bailout vote will be bigger problems in the primary than the general election.  Surveys repeatedly show that around 30% of women admit to fantasizing about being raped, with higher numbers for coercion.  This is evident from popular literature.  Of course, it does not mean that anyone actually wants to be raped, but it is also non-sensical to banish mention of that fact from discussions about how to reduce the incidence of rape.I  think you make strong arguments why he will not win the nomination.  If he can't carry CA or NY in the general, he will not win their primaries.  Your suggestion that people who go to the trouble of voting in a primary will then not bother to vote in the general is non-sensical.  It is true that moderates tend not to vote in primaries.  They are dominated by the party establishment.  If Sanders were merely "more Democrat" it would be dangerous to trust the judgment of primary voters.  But, I think he opens debate along a different axis, that focuses on the economy and the middle class, rather than traditional Democratic identity politics.That's all assuming the opposition is one of the current crop of Republicans.  If there were a truly moderate opponent, like a Bloomberg, then Clinton would be a much stronger candidate.  But, I trust the Democratic primary process to choose the right candidate.</comment>

<comment>You make very fair points and like you, I trust the process. I'm not the least bit moved by Bernie Sanders and view him with a lot of suspicion. Part of that is that I've grown very cynical when it comes to politics and part of it is that I'm still really angry about the 2000 election when what would have been the most liberal president in decades - Al Gore - lost to George W Bush because of leftists voting for a man I consider to be a fraud, Ralph Nader. I'm probably a moderate Democrat now though I still think I'm pretty liberal - I just have no tolerance for anti-capitalist screeds, neo-communism and/or appeals to the 1960's New Left. I like centrists, moderates and people who want to compromise. Bernie just manages to not check any of my boxes so that's that.For the rape comments, I agree with your take, only I think those words would be twisted (completely unfairly) into painting Sanders as pro-rape by the Republican attack machine. Bernie simply has not faced the true music yet and he's getting defensive about Hillary's rather kid gloves. Its horrid, but like I said I'm very cynical about politics. I assume the worst. I remember John McCain and the black baby smears in South Carolina; endless, repetitive anti-Clinton smears and of course 'Obama  being both a Muslim and an atheist. And I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the potential for college voters to lose steam and/or change their minds between now and election day. As kids get closer to graduation, they start thinking about work and out of self interest change their opinions to reflect their new environments. In short, a 'burn the banks' leftist is one job offer away from being a Republican. Not to mention, young voters are flakey and have short attention spans. I was at their age. I simply don't trust the youth vote and besides, they don't vote in midterms and rarely if ever vote at all.</comment>

<comment> We could have bailed out the bank customers rather than the banks.That's what Iceland did.  Then they prosecuted the bankers and put them in jail.</comment>

<comment>Indeed:"In the event of economic crisis, a country’s banking system is saved at all costs. When Iceland made the decision to go against the grain and let its banks fail, no one could have predicted the relatively fast turnaround that the economy has since experienced."http://www.worldfinance.com/in...</comment>

<comment>One problem with your theory, demographics don't line up for you. No matter who the dems. nominate, they have the advantage of running against a party that insults and denigrates the exact groups of people they need to try to win a nationwide election. i.e woman, african americans and latinos.</comment>

<comment>I wonder though, are these conservatives in the classical sense of the word?  They're not supporting incremental change or slow change to get what they believe should exist.  They're going for the big bang version of change.  That's not a little c conservative trait.  That's a Movement Conservative trait where conservative is just a word they use to contrast themselves with liberal (whatever they mean by that).</comment>

<comment>Conservative means keep what I have and get more.</comment>

<comment>"The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldestexercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superiormoral justification for selfishness." - John Kenneth Galbraith</comment>

<comment>I think it's more accurate to label them as "reactionaries".</comment>

<comment>Trump said about Bush what most Republicans have been afraid to say for a long time for fear of being called unpatriotic, a liberal, anti-semetic...etc...George W. Bush messed up big time and it's time he and his buddies own up to it.The NeoCons need to be cast out into oblivion, never to be heard from again.</comment>

<comment>Many Republicans openly admit Iraq was a mistake. Saying Bush intentionally lied about WMD as opposed to faulty intelligence, takes it to a place only the extreme left goes. Then throwing blame for 9/11 at W's feet is over the top, and incredible at a GOP debate. South Carolina Republicans hold George W Bush in high esteem and has a huge military voter base. This will end poorly for Trump. </comment>

<comment>And if it doesn't then what?</comment>

<comment>Well that's an excellent question to be honest if Trump still wins. I think Rubio has the best chance of beating Trump, but if Trump comes through with a big win in SC after this debate Trump will be in the driver seat. </comment>

<comment>Politics is about what have you done for me lately. Bush hasn't done anything for anyone in SC or anywhere lately. Trump has already said most of this stuff.</comment>

<comment>W. Bush's record looks worse and worse as the years go on.The supposed love for him is way overrated.</comment>

<comment>It was never love, but rather team spirit and media.</comment>

<comment>The military and evangelical base loves W and his approval rating among registered Republicans in SC is above 70%. Trump made a big tactical mistake and what was to be gained? Only downside if you ask me. </comment>

<comment>No he didn't.The military loves Trump too and W. isn't as popular as you think.That 70% number was pulled out of Karl Rove's behind.</comment>

<comment>Well your boy Trump really rolled the dice on this and we shall see who's right in a week. As I said, I just don't see the logic of his attack. </comment>

<comment>I see Trump's logic. The legacy of GWB is toxic. The longer the melee continues on the GOP side with Jeb?, Cruz and Rubio still in, the more Trump benefits from the "self-evisceration" of the GOP, as Frum aptly describes it.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps as long as Trump wins South Carolina and convincingly. I think he blew it obviously, but he's proven everyone wrong so far so...</comment>

<comment>I suspect Trump will win SC handily, even if he loses a few supporters. GWB's legacy is toxic. That's why Jeb? can't buy a vote anywhere.</comment>

<comment>Bush is toast, I agree as the expiration on Jeb and the Bush name is long over. I disagree on Trump, and I think he can lose. He had a big lead in Iowa too and lost. </comment>

<comment>Trump's lack of a ground game hurt him in the Iowa caucus. Primaries are a bit easier to get out the vote and Trump exceeded some polls estimates in New Hampshire and demonstrated a wide base of support. The Bush attack is unlikely to hurt him much in SC, but the damage to the GOP presidential prospects is undeniable.</comment>

<comment>Actually both ground game and TV ads are important in SC. Trump doesn't have a big game in SC like he had in NH and he is not buying a lot of ad time. </comment>

<comment>Trump managed to scam a bunch of hard headed New Englanders. SC may prove to be even more vulnerable.</comment>

<comment>The debate is televised nationally, though. I see his stance on the Iraq War as an olive branch offered to Democrats and Independents who really, really loathe the mistake we made in going to war. Thus far, anyone who feels this way has had little choice but to vote for the Democrat. Now ...</comment>

<comment>South Carolina isn't New Hampshire and if you don't think his comments won't impact Trump with that electorate, you are kidding yourself. It won't help Jeb, I agree with that, but it will hurt Trump! What was Trumps strategy for swinging down at Jeb anyway as he's done, unless Trump actually thought he was a threat? Makes no sense and it was a Huge mistake. </comment>

<comment>I think Trump wants Jeb out of the way because he thinks Rubio and Cruz are easier to beat. But I also think it was a test.It was a risk to find out how hard he can play against the old guard. He can back off and find some new tactic.If Bush or anyone keeps the issue open they lose since it isn't what they want to talk about.</comment>

<comment>I think it a very flawed and risky strategy by Trump. Bush is done regardless and actually if Bush gets out, it helps Rubio in particular. </comment>

<comment>I think Trump thinks he can beat Rubio. He wants to win it all on his terms --or nothing. Taking a risk has the benefit of creating uncertainty and fear..Rubio can't take that.</comment>

<comment>We shall see, but Trump had a big lead and took a high risk approach with little upside. He may have actually kept Bush in the race after SC now. Trump had a terrible debate and now is going to get slammed with a ginormous amount of negative adds including those from old Mitt Pac set up to hammer him. Trump has a lot of baggage and if he loses SC he will be in a crisis as he also will have to open his wallet big time. </comment>

<comment>I am not a prophet. But Bush in hurts Rubio and Bush can't win by defending 9/11 and Iraq. Rubio might be drawn in to that topic and that would not be good for him either.</comment>

<comment>Keeping Bush, Rubio and Cruz in the race as long as possible benefits Trump. Let the self-evisceration continue, as Frum describes it.</comment>

<comment>But Trump wants Jeb to stay in -- the division of the 'establishment lane' is great for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Watching Trump over these past few months makes me think he has little actual strategy.  He reads the crowd (and the polls) and then goes with his gut instincts.  Sometimes it works, but when it doesn't, he just moves on to the next thing so quickly that the other candidates are always scrambling to play catch up.I also think Trump has some long time grudge against Jeb Bush probably over something that happened in Florida while Bush was governor.And last night, with Rubio and Cruz duking it out, Trump didn't have to bother with them, so Bush was next.  </comment>

<comment>Bush runs as sober technocrat and attacks Trump for knowing nothing about world affairs and national security. Trump says Jeb owns the failure in Iraq and 9/11 and so does the old Republican party represented by Rubio. It is a strategy. It sounds true because it is. It skips the part where Trump actully does know nothing about world affairs.</comment>

<comment>What is truly frightening is that about half the electorate is going to vote for one of these guys no matter who it is.</comment>
