<comment>this author seems to know nothing the issues at stake.  There's no "decline" when Cliven Bundy still walks free with this $1million debt and with his cattle still trespassing.  There's no "decline" when the strategy of the Feds is to allow the continued occupation and destruction of the Refuge, and every indication is that they'll allow the occupiers to stay as long as they want and then walk away free.  The occupiers have actually accumulated MORE power and attention to the issue of federal vs local control of land.   Yeah, rational people disapprove of the situation, but our politics are not run by rational people.  There will be a bill in Congress any day now to "return" federal lands to the states</comment>

<comment>Cliven Bundy's cattle are worthless to him. Since the government has put a lien on them, he can't sell them as no one will buy them. No one will truck them as they could stand to lose their vehicle. All he can do is let them roam in the desert.The cattle are all low grade since they subsist on scrub and have to do a lot of traveling. They were all destined for hamburg anyway. The government are wise to let the crazies get distracted before arresting Bundy.The occupiers have been outed as welfare queens. They want to take MY land for their own purposes. I doubt they will win many friends over to their side.BTW, the land can't be "returned to the States". It was never the State's property to begin with. Every Western State Constitution, except California, carries a section acknowledging that the Federal Government owns the land that hasn't been homesteaded.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. That was a short but informative comment, I never knew that about the cattle.</comment>

<comment>They're taking YOUR land?</comment>

<comment>Well a lot of people carry on about "spending MY tax dollars on free lunches for other people's kids" so what's good for the goose......</comment>

<comment>NEWS FLASH!!!..your tax dollars are constantly being wasted..</comment>

<comment>BFD. Nothing is perfectly efficient. Waste is everywhere-- In the private AND public sector. So what? It's called "entropy". It's embedded in the laws of physics. Get used to it. Your own body is an illustration of entropy. If you don't expect that there is waste within any system, you're drunk on dreams.</comment>

<comment>So what you're saying is that you cherry pick which issues of waste to confront.</comment>

<comment>And we also see a lot of benefits - they just aren't very sexy benefits, but if these mundane actions by public officials suddenly stopped - you'd notice.  And notice fast. We take a lot for granted in this country because it has become part of the environmental wallpaper.</comment>

<comment>As in, land owned on his behalf (and on behalf of everyone) by the federal government.  Just like you own a tiny, tiny fraction of every aircraft carrier out there via your tax dollars in common with your fellow taxpayers.  And just like I own a piece of the whole Iraq fiasco W cooked up even though I opposed it from Day One.</comment>

<comment>Just because you pay for something doesn't mean you own it, don't let them fool you. </comment>

<comment>Actually it belongs to the Northern Paiute nation.</comment>

<comment>They should be given control over it. I'm sure it would be better cared for and not occupied the the HeeHawdi's that are now there.</comment>

<comment>Thank you!!! I keep saying the same thing!!!</comment>

<comment>Yes MY land.</comment>

<comment>Well then, stand up and fight for it. </comment>

<comment>How is your life affected by cattle grazing on land you'll probably never step foot on, again? I guess you prefer the GMO corn fed beef over organic free range beef.</comment>

<comment>The land belongs to the United States, that would be everyone, including Mr. Fusion. It is not the property of a few whack jobs with guns who are occupying it for reasons that they can not even articulate.</comment>

<comment>Yep - held for the American people.  Not just the Bundy's et al.</comment>

<comment>It's yours, too. You should be outraged.</comment>

<comment>But the problem is, this encourages other crazies because they're starting to realize they can get away with it.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>They are free to provide the government with an extensive case...  Sure.Personally,  I would prefer this not play out Waco or Ruby Ridge style.   No martyrs,  thanks.   Let them talk...  They're sinking their own movement. </comment>

<comment>Thanks for the background information.</comment>

<comment>What lien on his cattle?  No you are imagining this.  The Justice Department has yet to take action.</comment>

<comment>There is a Federal lien on the cattle. It has been there since April last year when the government attempted to round up the cattle.That means the government may seize them at any point, at their choosing. If you buy Bundy's cattle, the government may still come in and seize them. If they are on your truck, they may take the truck too. If they are in your feeding pens, they may still seize them and leave you with the feeding bill.So now Bundy is stuck with the cattle that he can't sell anyway. Or, would you risk buying them knowing the government could come in and just take them? What would you do then, sue Bundy?</comment>

<comment>No apparent Tax Lien on the cattle according to Clark County records nor charge to be filed vs Mr. Bundy. Unless we wish to argue that liens on property within a particular state no longer need to be filed in the correct jurisdiction in that state, no recognizable liens appear to have been filed. Source after Quote."No criminal charges have been filed against Bundy, and a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's office in Nevada, as a matter of Department of Justice policy, declined to say whether any were being considered. Clark County records showed no tax liens levied against Bundy or his ranch.""Cliven Bundy still owes the U.S. $1 million.

<comment>The lien is on record in Las Vegas Federal District Court. Yjay was why the BLM started rounding up the cattle in April 2014, before all those Bundy Terrorists came to town.https://docs.justia.com/cases/...Federal orders aren't posted in State courts.</comment>

<comment>I stop paying my student loans the govnt sure as shi* comes after me.  Why do these parasites get a free ride?  It is unbelievable what they are getting away with...</comment>

<comment>It's unbelievable that government would charge ranchers to graze on land that requires no maintenance, now that's unbelievable.</comment>

<comment>It does require stewardship and long-range planning,  however. </comment>

<comment>Just like all the necessary planning that took place to ensure that the wild buffalo, that once roamed in the millions, didn't destroy this country's landscape?.. I think nature's got this one, it doesn't need our intervention to create Eco systems.</comment>

<comment>Your response appears to completely contradict your first post.   The Feds will do a far better job letting nature work than any private entity.  Mother nature can only do so much as fragmented as the land has become and with invasives incroaching.   If you think letting it go unmanaged and unmonitored you've no real knowledge of ecology.  Even if the prescription is "do nothing"  it still must be descided because it is not certain to yield the results that are needed. </comment>

<comment>You do not know the difference between the grazing habits of bison over the entire Great Plains and the grazing habits of cattle in the current habitat? Or the difference between the ecology the bison subsisted within and the current ecology, utterly changed by decades of agriculture? If not, enjoy this informative study: http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/...</comment>

<comment>Yeah no kidding huh!  The poor ranchers only getting a 93% discount on grazing fees as compared to the cost to the ranchers if it were privately-owned lands!!1!!1!!1!one!!1!</comment>

<comment>Umm, it costs money to do maintenance. Vastly more than the grazing fees. You cannot let nature handle it, one of the reason for this entire mess is evasive species of plants that would take over if left to nature, well atleast the modified nature due to human involvement already.</comment>

<comment>So nature is no longer capable in managing its own ecosystems? It's only been in the last 100 years or so that man has adopted this mentality. Ironically, with the start of the Industrial Revolution dating back to around the same time period, man has done more damage to this planet in this short amount of time than he has in all the recorded years of man's existence. Maybe we should worry more about us and let nature do what it does best, just like the millions of buffalo that once roamed and didn't destroy the landscape, I doubt these cattle would either.</comment>

<comment>It seems that you have neglected to take many things into consideration... Such as how many more people are in the world using your own example... In 1916 the population of the US was 102 million people, today, 100 years later in 2016 the population is almost 321 million... Yes, man has done a horrid amount of damage to this planet so WHY would you want it to continue??? WHY would you give these criminal actions a pass???</comment>

<comment>If it is left alone to nature yes, however we are not talking about leaving it alone to nature. first of all cows are not native to the west, they came from Europe, so we have that non native speices that man has added. As for doubting that these cows could destroy the landscape, it has already happened once, in that area. In the 1930s due to cows overgrazing the area was a dust bowl.Mother nature works, if left completely alone, but that is not what they are wanting here.</comment>

<comment>Actually, there has been research conducted that shows the mimicking of herds reverses desertification of the land. All of this discussion over land usage and rights is masking over the real issue at hand, which is the injustice brought upon the Hammonds. To be tried and sentenced under a "terrorist" act, come on man. The mainstream media is purposely ignoring the fact that Bundy has allegedly uncovered evidence that the BLM had discriminated against this family, from pulling permits from them in the middle of contract and issuing them to others, to alleged evidence of video and eyewitness accounts saying that BLM actually started the fires that were ultimately the cause of the Hammonds being convicted. Allegedly, this prosecuter knew of and withheld this evidence. Whether these claims are of any merit or not, they should be fully investigated by the media and they're not? I wonder why?</comment>

<comment>why do people keep spreading this lie, over and over again. They were not tried and sentenced under a "terrorist" act.  They were tried and sentenced under 18 US code chapter  5, ARSON. It happens that the terrorism act under 18 IS code chapter 113B sets the minimum penalty for ALL arson, terrorist related or not, tat 5 years.As for Bundy ALLEGEDLY uncovering evidence of wrong doing, if it is wrong doing then sue them. If they actually have evidence of wrong doing then they will win a lawsuit, since you can get a lawsuit by jury.Also there were no such eyewitnesses, the family has admitted to setting the fires, but claimed a different reason. Stop reading fringe conservative conspiracy sites.</comment>

<comment>They keep spreading the lie because they are either profoundly stupid or Bundy family. Or both. </comment>

<comment>Bundy and his allies, instead of occupying federal buildings and land, at great cost to the taxpayers -- $70k/day to the county alone -- would be better advised to raise money for the defense fund of the family they intend to stand up for. They are alienating many of their supporters by their dubious tactics, people who essentially agree with them on this issue, but prefer to work within the constitutional framework that's in place already.</comment>

<comment>One herd. In Africa. Not in the US. Many believe that wouldn't work here. Including the man from TED talks. </comment>

<comment>Blm didn't start those fires. Your tin foil hat must be on too tight. </comment>

<comment>False, the dust bowl was caused by mechanized farming that the unanchored soil combined with a drought and high winds created the dust.</comment>

<comment>They'll need to return to work at some point. Or will they leave when government benefit checks hit the mail?I feel bad for local residents who have to tolerate this stupidity. Armed protest is a powder keg waiting to explode. They should study history, insurrection in this country hasn't been met kindly. See Whiskey Rebellion and Shay's Rebellion.</comment>

<comment>There was one of them who wanted to go but couldn’t because his disability check wouldn’t cover the trip. If the government just gave him more money he could go protest the government.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes I think these people live only to confirm our most uncharitable characterizations of them</comment>

<comment>Thereby creating truth.We owe them.</comment>

<comment>He should be given housing in a Federal Prison.</comment>

<comment>See Whiskey Rebellion and Shay's Rebellion.Add in John Brown's Harper Ferry rebellion. Most of the rebels end up dead.</comment>

<comment>Yet taxes were cut and a debt moratorium imposed, the whiskey tax was repealed, and slavery abolished. "I hold it that a little rebellion now and then is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical." -Thomas Jefferson</comment>

<comment>This country was built on an insurrection.</comment>

<comment>But not a patently stupid insurrection.  All insurrections aren't equal.</comment>

<comment>This is not the 18th century.  (Although the Bundys and their ilk are trying to send us back there.)</comment>

<comment>We only needed one to do it too. The time for insurrection is long ago.</comment>

<comment>and the righties did nothing</comment>

<comment>Washington complained up and down about the disorganized militias that fought alongside his trained, organized troops.  The militia may  have played a role in the Revolution, but it was won by plain old military training and organization.  What the brothers Bundy, et al are doing in Oregon looks nothing even close to what the Revolution looked like.  And we'd still be part of England if the continental army was made up of Bundys.</comment>

<comment>Yes -- AGAINST THE BRITISH EMPIRE LED BY A MONARCH. Not a republic, elected by voters in the several states.</comment>

<comment>See American Revolution.</comment>

<comment>Um, not remotely the same. And these clowns don't have the majority of the US population on their side. Heck, not even enough to take over the small town, let alone Oregon itself.LOL.</comment>

<comment>Neither did the folks who started the American Revolution (or, actually, separatist movement).  My recollection is that they had about a third of the population; a third opposed and a third were indifferent until the war itself galvanized them.  And as Paddy should know, the  Easter Rising was considered the work of violent fools by most Irish people in 1916.  It was the response that turned the tide.  If you can pull it off, it's better to make your opponents laughingstocks rather than martyrs.</comment>

<comment>The Easter Rising was an independence movement against foreign British rule. It was quickly quashed, but led the way towards eventual independence for the Republic of Ireland. However, there is still little comparison to this Bundy protest.The Irish had been subject to centuries of British rule, starting with the 12th century Norman Invasion. Their beef was more legitimate, in my humble opinion. The Irish were for independence from foreign rule, the Bundys are for independence from domestic rule.Or, more accurately, staging an insurrection to justify their false preconceptions of the Federal Government's land ownership. Even local Oregonians suspicious of the Feds are growing tired of this brouhaha.</comment>

<comment>Yes because being a greedy entitled freeloading prick who steals from American citizens is just like being a Founding Father..</comment>

<comment>You'd do best to read a little more about the Revolution than the nationalist mythology about it.  It wasn't won by a bunch of rag-tag militiamen.  It was won by an organized military force led by a full military heirarchy.  A heirarchy that was annoyed to no end by 18th century Ammon Bundys that kept running from the battlefield, screwing up plans, and generally causing problems for the continental army.  In the end their role may have had some importance, but we aren't the US because of an 18th century Ammon Bundy, we are the US because of an 18th century George Washington, Ben Franklin, and a big pile of well-trained, regular troops, uniforms and all.</comment>

<comment>As I understand it, a big part of this stems from another rancher being sentenced for arson because he did a controlled burn on government land that he was leasing...and then being sentenced to more time because his original term in jail didn't meet mandatory minimum standards. That right there is some stone cold bullsh!t and is worth addressing. This, however, isn't how you address it.</comment>

<comment>A jury made up of local people found the Hammonds guilty of arson to cover up illegal hunting. They were convinced of this beyond a reasonable doubt. So, it was NOT a controlled burn, it was a crime.</comment>

<comment>Oh, I realize that. The point I was trying to get to was the mandatory minimum rules, which is a problem all across the justice system. Sentencing someone to more time after they've already served time.</comment>

<comment>Oh, okay. I was confused by your reference to arson as a controlled burn. A substitution like that can make a person think you are trying to minimize the crime that was committed.</comment>

<comment>well they always knew they would probably have to serve the time, the prosecution cannot help it that the judge made an illegal ruling on the length of the term.</comment>

<comment>That is incorrect. They did illegal hunting and set the land on fire to obscure that fact. It was not a "controlled burn".</comment>

<comment>Again, the point I was trying to get to was regarding the mandatory minimums.</comment>

<comment>OK. I can agree with that, but it certainly seems that they should have had a longer sentence than they originally got for arson. That is the fault of the court, but the courts should have some discretion in sentencing. Minimum sentences, especially for minor drug charges have caused prison overcrowding. </comment>

<comment>He burned the land when the lease said he had to get permission first, and the government kept telling him no, because there was a drought and a risk of the fire getting out of control, on and a state/federal block on fires because of the drought. In one of them it also caused 400k of damage to other ranches nearby. Also that is if you take the best case scenario and ignore the witnesses who said it was because of illegal poaching they were trying to cover up.</comment>

<comment>Bundy: "We'll leave if the locals tell us to."Locals: "Leave."Bundy: "We're here for the long haul."I know consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, but for Pete's sake, Bundy, you're trying to appeal to people for whom honesty and keeping your word still have some meaning. Idiot.</comment>

<comment>Corollary:Bundy: "Don't Tread On Me!"Rest of planet: "Okay, cool. See you later...Have a nice day!"[Rest of planet turns and walks away]Bundy: "W--Wait! Where ya goin'? Don't you wanna tread on me???"</comment>

<comment>"No, don't think so we already have enough cow pie on our boots". What a sorry group of wannabes.</comment>

<comment>Bundy: "And please send some snacks."</comment>

<comment>"And what's up with all these dildos we keep getting in the mail? Don't people know we're heroes?"</comment>

<comment>I think their 'revolution' lost credibly almost exactly when they requested French Vanilla Coffee Creamer in their list of demands.</comment>

<comment>Why are they allowed a list of demands anyway? All communication with the outside world should be cut off. If there is WIFI, shut it down. If they have cell phones, the FBI can have the carriers shut them down. These guys are engaged in criminal activity and need to be treated as criminals.</comment>

<comment>Seems as if they would cut off utilities, WIFI....However, maybe the FBI has tapped their phones, etc., and is gathering information that can be used against them in a criminal case.</comment>

<comment>Good thought. That's a possibility. </comment>

<comment>And tampons.</comment>

<comment>If there is anything funnier than a bunch of wannabe revolutionary tough-guys begging the public for supplies like French vanilla creamer, conditioner, shredded AND sliced cheese, slippers, and mayonnaise to maintain their "occupation," I don't know what it would be.</comment>

<comment>The whole thing's a farce."Live off the land" my a**.</comment>

<comment>I remember reading about Washington's men at Valley Forge and their desperate requests for pillow cases.</comment>

<comment>Pillow cases?  They didn't even have shoes!(for real, some didn't- reading a history of the Revolution right now)</comment>

<comment>I believe that was sarcasm.</comment>

<comment>I know, I was trying to go with it.</comment>

<comment>They wanted the pillowcases so they could make shoes out of them.</comment>

<comment>Ah, very resourceful!</comment>

<comment>ROTFL!!!</comment>

<comment>Live off the Burns Oregon Safeway.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, it seems like they didn't actually look at the land in question before they decided they'd live off of it. The Oregon High Desert/outback is pretty harsh; it's no Eden.</comment>

<comment>Fair point.</comment>

<comment>So true. This needs to be fact checked but if memory serves; this particular area was purchased back by the US because conditions were too harsh for ranchers of the day to survive. I've  done road trips and hunted in the region, beautiful country but you'll have better luck writing the "great American novel" than raising cattle in "dem thar parts"</comment>

<comment>The US Government bought it off a cattle baron who had run all the other wannabe ranchers and farmers off a vast tract of the territory.  He probably got a sweet deal from the Feds.</comment>

<comment>No, it was purchased back as a result of a tax swindle. Wealthy easterners accumulated property by fraudulent homesteading, and then farmed the hell out of the land until it was exhausted. Then they went bankrupt and begged the federal government for a bailout. Uncle Sugar purchased their land.</comment>

<comment>They're living off the political landscape of Murica.</comment>

<comment>French (should really be FREEDOM vanilla creamer) vanilla creamer? Why, if it weren’t for America, that damn creamer would taste like German chocolate!</comment>

<comment>Now that was funny.Just as an aside though, German Chocolate was named after the American that invented (created ?) it. It is not named after the country.</comment>

<comment>Then why is it not called AMERICAN or FREEDOM chocolate?!?Durn SJW libturds. Always trying to take the glory away from the White man.</comment>

<comment>GAWD !!! I just imagined some American chocolate in the same vein as American cheese. Plastic chocolate just doesn't appeal to me.</comment>

<comment>Hershey's isn't bad, I don't know why.</comment>

<comment>People think Budwiser isn't bad.And... it's not. It's just not good. If you like beer because beer is interesting, it's boring as shit and weak. I'll drink a cold bud if nothing else is there, but a cold Budvar (the company that *stayed* in Barvaria when Bud hit the US) is miles better.</comment>

<comment>Were I in the neighborhood I'd drop by, set up a little miniature catapult twenty yards or so from the front door, then lob some individual little packets of creamer outside the door, just to be able to watch a "militant" waddle outside, pick up the creamer, and waddle back inside to safety.</comment>

<comment>American Cheese was invented by a Canadian.</comment>

<comment>...and if it weren't for France, America would not exist at all.</comment>

<comment>"begging the public for supplies like French vanilla creamer, conditioner, shredded AND sliced cheese, slippers, and mayonnaise"Just like George Washington at Valley Forge /sarc</comment>

<comment>Ha!  Great minds think alike.</comment>

<comment>Revolutionary War birth control consisted of keeping 'em pregnant in the summer and barefoot in the winter. I have no idea of who ever thought that would work with men.</comment>

<comment>What happened to ordering from Amazon?  Oh, wait...then they have to pay for these things themselves.</comment>

<comment>Watching them open packages sent to them that are full of "bag of dicks" candy and dildos.http://www.rawstory.com/2016/0...</comment>

<comment>That's fantastic.  And I do think it's telling that he thinks spending twenty bucks to make fun of them is someone spending "all their money."</comment>

<comment>It is to him, being on Federal government welfare.  Altho as he said, he's "fortunate to have a wife who works."  Guess she doesn't want to hand over her paychecks to him.</comment>

<comment>Asking that it be sent by US Mail?  That is funnier!</comment>

<comment>Slippers? Are they gay?</comment>

<comment>Really? Sounds like something from Emo Kylo Ren's Twitter account.</comment>

<comment>Them getting dildos and bags of dicks instead of the requested supplies, is my submission for something funnier.</comment>

<comment>Don't shred their cheese for them, teach them to shred! Send them a cheese grater! With instructions!</comment>

<comment>You forgot tampons...</comment>

<comment>But there's a certain brand. It's called, "Sovereign Citizen Tampons." They absorb grazing fees.</comment>

<comment>Will someone please send them an espresso machine and a box of assorted syrups? It's time that they got into the barista game. They should whip up some lattes, get that milk all frothed, get wired on caffeine, and then sit around and pontificate. It's a great pastime. Hours seem like minutes.</comment>

<comment>As someone else commented, it seems more like a sleepover for teenage girls than a revolutionary occupation.</comment>

<comment>"The militia members say they are staging an occupation, but if the local population doesn’t back them, it’s really an invasion."uh? I suggest to the author to read the dictionary.</comment>

<comment>Compared to the BLM 'peaceful' protests, these are really peaceful and non disruptive.</comment>

<comment>The BLM should have been armed then. That would have gone great.</comment>

<comment>They were, but didn't want bloodshed.  More's the pity.</comment>

<comment>The thing is that weren't even armed, yet they burned down cities. LOL</comment>

<comment>Burned down cities?No, San Francisco was burned down in 1906, Tokyo was burned down in 1945. A handful of the millions of protesters have been linked to arson and they burned how many buildings?</comment>

<comment>It took me three readings through this thread to figure out what it was about.  I was reading BLM as Bureau of Land Management, in context,  and wondering if there was some bit of Western history I'd missed (The Department of the Interior burned Tokyo?  Uh, wasnt it the Air Force?)Silly me. (And silly Molly...)   I should have expected the off topic racist comment.  Especially after reading Yahoo threads.</comment>

<comment>Can you list a few of the buildings the BLM occupied while armed?</comment>

<comment>It's like when I peacefully walk up to people, point a gun at them and ask for their money. They are so kind and generous and always give it to me. And it's all done peacefully, not like some thugs would do it!</comment>

<comment>Did they aim any gun at anyone or threaten to shoot anyone?</comment>

<comment>You think they brought their guns for no reason?At the Bundy ranch, they did point guns. This is largely the same group, and they have threatened by doing the occupation while armed.</comment>

<comment>Blm, also pointed weapons at unarmed protesters. </comment>

<comment>I don't call rampaging through the Refuge computers, using their vehicles and tearing down part of a legal fence "non disruptive."  I kind of doubt they're going to go for the "You broke it. You buy it." philosophy either.</comment>

<comment>That is it? Compared to the arson, looting and riots in big populated cities, that's nothing. Yet you feel "terror" for the treatment of that poor fence. LOL. Hilarious.</comment>

<comment>I feel terror that our country could be taken over by angry armed overweight men.</comment>

<comment>This idea may shock you, but isn't it just remotely possible that the Ferguson rioters and the militia wanna-bes are both in the wrong?</comment>

<comment>I certainly think that's the case.</comment>

<comment>HEY LOOK IT'S STUPID!</comment>

<comment>The Bundy Bunch Yihad at the Malheur refuge is a perfect illustration of the world the 2nd Amendment fanatics are bringing us. They have said for years that they need to arm up to fight off the "tyranical" government. Well here they are, all armed up, taking over a Federal wildlife refuge, and daring the feds to come shoot it out with them. And what we get is basically anarchy, with yahoos from all over showing up with THEIR guns and their own agendas. Biggest gun wins? Who knows?I don't know how or when this will end, but I dearly hope these guys end up in cuffs, prosecuted to the full extent of the law, and that not a one of them is ever allowed to own a gun again in their natural lives.</comment>

<comment>I will be very disappointed if the LEOs allow them to just drive home. That would send the wrong message to all the other armed hot heads out there.</comment>

<comment>Yes the Bundy Yall Queda must be wiped off the map so all white people will understand who is really in charge in America.</comment>

<comment>I like Vanilla ISIS myself..</comment>

<comment>Trailer Daesh.</comment>

<comment>When it comes to enforcing the nations laws, the governmnent of the people and by the people is in charge. And yes, from time to time some people like the Bundys need to learn that lesson the hard way.</comment>

<comment>I'm partial to the Bundy Talibanjos.</comment>

<comment>Didn't Robert Crumb play with them, once?</comment>

<comment>I don't care if they make it home as long as a warrant is waiting for them.</comment>

<comment>I'd rather have them arrested at home than in a public building.  It could make a mess.</comment>

<comment>Yeah but we are laughing at them. Not with them.</comment>

<comment>These guys want to boot the federal government out so they can carve up, burn, pollute and mine the west into a toxic wasteland. Its shortsighted greed run amock driven by decades of radical propaganda vilifying the federal government. Rush Limbaugh, Fox "News", Breitbart and the rest of the constantly outraged fringe right have 1st Amendment protections, but their call to open rebellion is going to be one of the primary challenges of the coming decades.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  Now the gloves are off.</comment>

<comment>Oh, so then he's a traitor too. </comment>

<comment>Traitor says what?</comment>

<comment>They want mandatory minimum sentencing for everyone in the country except for two guys who look like them.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and their full-throated appeal for release of nonviolent marijuana offenders deeply moved me.</comment>

<comment>Did the Oregon squatters ever get the snacks they were desperately begging for?</comment>

<comment>Yes. A truckload of Hostess cupcakes and twinkies. We on the left sent it complimentary, figuring if they are going to stay a long time we could kill them off this way.</comment>

<comment>Ah yeah....a diabetes trap!</comment>

<comment>We are hoping for clogged arteries. Its quicker.</comment>

<comment>Bottled water from Flint?  Not that you'd notice the decline in cognitive capacity.</comment>

<comment>We wrote "fresh, possibly slightly contaminated springwater from heavily grazed watersheds" on the labels. We didn't mention Flint.</comment>

<comment>Nice.</comment>

<comment>They went straight away for the twinkies until they realized they were a food.</comment>

<comment>I question this premise. Are Twinkies really food??</comment>

<comment>Not the lower case kind.(my apologies for the gay slur)</comment>

<comment>No, but they're cheaper than food.</comment>

<comment>This so called rebellion should never have been allowed to go on this long just like the first one where the same kind of armed thugs were pointing guns as federal agents! This was never about land. It was just the don't tread on me anti- government crew wanting a showdown with the government. How ridiculous we look in the eyes of the world where armed citizens can control a situation where in reality they should have been arrested straight away! 2nd amendment is the excuse they always use to come armed and dangerous to rallies or anything else that ticks them off. These people need to be brought back into reality that they don't run the country the government does.</comment>

<comment>They need a drone strike to stop their white privileges of being able to safely rebel.</comment>

<comment>Its not worth a shootout that makes martyrs of them and underlines their arguement that they face a "tyranical" government. A tyranical government would have vaporized these guys a week ago.Let them have a few weeks or months making utter fools of themselves and their movement, and then when they leave serve them with arrest warrants once they have dispersed back to their homes.Sometimes you best demonstrate power by not jumping to use it.</comment>

<comment>Where else in this nation has the government ever turned its back on enforcing the law when there are guns involved?</comment>

<comment>Its not turning its back if it follows up later. Its biding its time. And this tactic has been used before, recently even. IN Utah a bunch of these yahoops staged a "protest" by driving ATVs all over a parotected area. Afterwards they were prosecuted and the leaders are now doing time.</comment>

<comment>its an old-timey cop tactic.  You defuse the situation, but make sure you find out who was involved.  You let them go, and then cruise by their homes and arrest them later.  That's what should have happened in the Walter Scott case.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  The cops should be following these guys and arresting them one by by as they go out for supplies.</comment>

<comment>How along ago was the Bundy Ranch situation diffused? Cliven Bundy still owes his grazing fees and is still grazing his cattle in restricted areas..</comment>

<comment>That situation was only diffused when the Feds went home without the cattle they had come to take. I was talkling about a different incident.</comment>

<comment>I remember reading recently, in the NY Times I think, that the Bundys are having trouble because no one will buy their cattle because there's a federal lien on anything they sell to pay those back grazing fees. No slaughterhouses want to deal with the legal trouble. I suspect they're living on past savings or fellow wingnuts are contributing to them.</comment>

<comment>I found only one person was arrested, a county commissioner. Do you have any links to other people being charged?</comment>

<comment>No, I had read that it was the leaders. But don't recall where I read it.</comment>

<comment>Serve them with arrest warrants and garnish their checks as restitution for the damage they've done. They are in people's workplaces, and public property.</comment>

<comment>Indeed.</comment>

<comment>It is not in the government's interest to give anti government types the showdown they crave. Let them make their statement. Charge and fine them for any damages incurred. End of story.</comment>

<comment>The federal land is not for the use of the locals. It is owned by all the people theoretically. Letting Bundy graze his cattle is a sign of how pathetic the bureaucrats  handle  business.But the best lesson here is how to deal with Trump: ignore him. He'll leave for greener pastures where the flock waits for inspiration from a mentally challenged individual with whom they have no social connection.</comment>

<comment>Allowing the ranchers to lease the land is a holdover from last century when any land not homesteaded was open range. To protect and manage the environment, the government, through the BLM has forced the ranchers to lease land they want to use. The leases are all largely below market prices.Most ranchers do respect the land and treat it well. Those like Cliven Bundy abused their leases and caused a lot of damage.</comment>

<comment>I don't know about forcing.  The land was and is owned by the US.  What landlord allows anyone free reign over property without charging rent?</comment>

<comment>KILL THEM ALL.</comment>

<comment>Maybe we can evacuate the town for a week and let the 2 groups of vigilantes kill each other.  </comment>

<comment>The author is clueless and i have nothing but instant regret reading this crap. Clueless is a understatement. The over reach of the feds is at an explosion point,</comment>

<comment>Yeah, who do the feds think they are managing federal lands?  The nerve!</comment>

<comment>The federal government is not allowed to own property other than government buildings and infrastructure. Try reading what the constitution says,</comment>

<comment>I see.  So no military bases or testing facilities, then?In any event, could you point me to the portion of the Constitution which limits the federal government in this way?</comment>

<comment>Article 4 Section 3 Clause 2 of the US Constitution begs to differ.</comment>

<comment>NO, SpawnofGoats, Article 4 Sec. 3 Clause2 of the Constitution does NOT beg to differ - see my previous post - it says "Congress shall have the power" to regulate "Property owned by the United States" - let me repeat that last phrase, nit-wit "PROPERTY OF THE UNITED STATES". Now . . . once again, WHERE in the Constitution does it say anything different?</comment>

<comment>It says US government can own property and land.  Are we in agreement?  What are posting in response to?</comment>

<comment>The constitution was written by racists. It is as valuable as toilet paper.</comment>

<comment>Of course you cannot understand freedom and liberty because you are a simple mind and will do what you are told</comment>

<comment>I think you might want to re-read the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Does               the Constitution Grant the Federal Government the Power to Legislate               over Land within the Several States?              By Robert Greenslade © Nitwit Press          Mission             Statement            Revised             8.04.04            Editorial Policy Revised             3.19.04          See             Reader's          Feedback          Reader's             Forum          Looking             for Health NEW          Commentary            on the News          Return             to Home PageFebruary         06, 2006        If the federal government had been granted general legislative authority,         as many believe, then that government would have exclusive jurisdiction         over all persons and things throughout the United States. That would include         all land within the several States. The American people might be surprised         to learn that the Constitution bars the federal government from exercising         legislative jurisdiction over any land, within the several States, unless         it first obtains permission from the legislature of that State. This little         known fact is simply another component of the federal system of government         established by the Constitution.In order         to understand the federal government's limited power concerning land within         the several States, it is first necessary to review the proceedings in         the Federal [Constitutional] Convention of 1787. On September 5, it was         proposed that Congress should have the power:"To         exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever over such district         (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states         and the acceptance of the legislature, become the seat of government of         the United States; and to exercise the authority over all places purchased         for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and other         needful buildings."The primary         purpose of this clause was to establish a seat of government and transfer         legislative jurisdiction over this land from the States [Maryland and         Virginia] to the federal government. Since all the land within the United         States belonged to the individual States, or their citizens, and the States         had exclusive jurisdiction over all land within their borders, a constitutional         provision was needed before it could be ceded to the federal government.         This provision would also allow the federal government to purchase land,         within the States, "for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,         dock-yards, and other needful buildings." In addition, this clause         would grant the federal government "exclusive jurisdiction"         over any land acquired for these five (5) federal functions.When this         provision was under consideration, a member of the Constitutional Convention         asserted "that this power might be made use of to enslave any particular         state by buying up its territory, and that the strongholds proposed would         be a means of awing the state into an undue obedience to the general government."         In response, a motion was made to "insert, after the word 'purchased,'         the words, 'by the consent of the legislature of the state.' This change,         as asserted by the delegate who proposed it, "would certainly make         the power safe. This provision, with the consent provision added, became         Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the Constitution for the United States.In 1956,         a congressional committee prepared a report entitled "Jurisdiction         over Federal Areas within the States" The Report examined the         consent requirement of Clause 17:"The         debates in the Constitutional Convention are also of interest in the light         they cast on the purpose of the consent requirement of clause 17. There         appears to be no question but that the requirement was added simply to         foreclose the possibility that a State might be destroyed by the purchase         by the Federal Government of all the property within that State. Could         the Federal Government acquire exclusive jurisdiction over all property         purchased by it within a State, without the consent of that State, the         latter would have no means of preserving its integrity."As stated         above, the consent requirement was added to protect the States from the         federal government. Without the consent provision, the federal government         could theoretically destroy the States and supplant their authority.The significance         of the consent requirement is important for another reason. Clause 17         and the above report use the phrase "exclusive jurisdiction"         in conjunction with federal land acquisitions. This term is also referred         to as "exclusive legislative jurisdiction." The 1956 committee         report defined this phrase as follows:"The         term 'exclusive legislative jurisdiction' as used in this report refers         to the power 'to exercise exclusive legislation' granted to the Congress         by article I, section 8, clause 17, of the Constitution, and to the like         power which may be acquired by the United States through cession by a         State, or by a reservation made by the United States in connection with         the admission of a State into the Union. In the exercise of such power         as to an area in a State the Federal Government theoretically displaces         the State in which the area is contained of all its sovereign authority,         executive and judicial as well as legislative. By State and Federal statutes         and judicial decisions, however, it is accepted that a reservation by         a State of only the right to serve criminal and civil process in an area,         resulting from activities which occurred off the area, is not inconsistent         with exclusive legislative jurisdiction.When the         federal government acquires "exclusive legislative jurisdiction"         over any land within one of the United States pursuant to Clause 17, it         divests the State of authority over that land. As stated above, after         such a transfer, "only Congress has authority to legislate for the         area." Thus, state law is ousted and replaced by federal law.There are         two other methods for the federal government to acquire legislative jurisdiction         over land within a State. It should be noted that neither of these are         found in the Constitution. They are judicially created methods. The first         is for the States to pass a general cession statute. These statutes allow         the federal government to purchase land and acquire legislative jurisdiction         without seeking formal permission from the state legislature each and         every time it wants to make an acquisition. Since these statutes are voluntary         acts on the part of the States, they are viewed in the same light as a         Clause 17 transfer because the statute satisfies the consent requirement.         The second method is for the federal government to reserve jurisdiction         at the time statehood is granted to a territory. This does not involve         a transfer of legislative jurisdiction because the State never had jurisdiction         over the land in the first place. This is how the federal government gained         control over so much property in the western United States.It should         be noted that the majority of all purchases and transfers of legislative         jurisdiction have been through State cession statutes, not Clause 17.         This continues to be rule rather than the exception. Every State in the         Union has adopted general statutes relating to the purchase of land and         the acquisition of legislative jurisdiction by the federal government.         These statutes, as stated above, allow the federal government to purchase         property and acquire legislative jurisdiction without petitioning the         legislature of the State where the land is located.</comment>

<comment>"Nitwit Press" That's so perfect.</comment>

<comment>With all due respect "theworldlaughs* ( which in your case is ZERO), I'll take the word of the author of the following link, who actually has some expertise in the matter, as opposed to your un-informed opinion. As he points out, this is a matter that has been settled by the Supreme Court several times - the Federal Govt. most assuredly CAN (and does) own land. NOTHING in the Constitution says otherwise. Sorry to pop your fantasy bubble with facts, but as they say . . . . reality has a decidedly left-wing bias.One need not read the link, actually - all one need do is read the Constitution - have YOU tried that? Here's the clause usually cited by you whack-a-doodles (Article 4, Sec. 3, Clause 2): The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States; and nothing in this Constitution shall be so construed as to Prejudice any Claims of the United States, or of any particular State.Note, please, note the phrase "Property belonging to the United States" - use what ever definitions you like - it says PROPERTY BELONGING TO THE UNITED STATES, sport - BELONGING TO THE UNITED STATES. How can the Constitution say the Federal Govt. can't own property when it clearly says "property owned by the United States (are you saying that, according to the Constitution the Federal Govt. of the United States is NOT the United States?)Now, show us where the Constitution says the Federal Govt. "is not allowed to own property the than govt. buildings and infrastructure". I keep seeing that posted, have yet to see WHERE it's written in the Constitution. Enlighten us, please.Link to several Supreme Court rulings that say the Federal Govt. CAN own property - dating from far back in the Nation's history:http://www.lectlaw.com/files/c...</comment>

<comment>Why is it suddenly becoming an issue now, if this has been the case for more than a century?</comment>

<comment>Please read my reply to jim chaplin and tell me what you think</comment>

<comment>Short version: "I pooped my pants and need cleaning up!"</comment>

<comment>There is a good reason camp fires are prohibited on federal lands, but the fed reaction was way out of proportion. No wildfires raged, no damage was done, a simple fine would have been just fine.</comment>

<comment>Living out West has taught me that fires are unpredictable and uncontrollable in many situations.  Deliberately setting a fire is a serious matter.</comment>

<comment>I still remember the fire safety lesson my Dad gave me when I was a kid, when he showed me that the ashes from a fire can be hot enough to boil water 12 hrs after the fire was out.</comment>

<comment>This armed occupation has gone way beyond whatever grievance might exist over the sentence handed down to the Hammonds. In fact the occupiers don't even mention that issue any more. They want to take federal land at gunpoint. Full stop.</comment>

<comment>You do realize we're not actually talking about campfires here, right?  And there absolutely was damage and wildfires as a result.  The 2001 fire burned 130 acres before it was put out.  The second fire threatened firefighters that were battling a lightning caused wildfire, and found themselves caught in between two major fires.Apparently nobody was actually hurt in the end, so five years was probably excessive.. but trying to portray this as an argument over placement of a campfire is a bit disingenuous, at best.</comment>

<comment>You obviously don't live out here in the West. Setting uncontrolled fires in the wilderness is gambling with people's lives, particularly firefighters'.</comment>

<comment>I understand not wanting an armed confrontation but this is obviously what the occupiers want. Why are they allowed to have food dropped off and come and go as they please and now destroy property? All I can think of is the 12 year old boy in Ohio who was shot by police 2 seconds after they arrived and was carrying a toy gun. Here officials are sitting down and trying to reason with the unreasonable who have now occupied a federal building for 11 days with ZERO repercussions!</comment>

<comment>So....  When will the law finally be enforced on Cliven Bundy?  Hmmm?</comment>

<comment>Gotta love the Irony-Free Zone. A bunch of heavily-armed carpetbagging "militia" Walter Mittys from places like Arizona and Idaho show up in Oregon to DEMAND that the feds "return control" of public land the "the locals." And, they go to the POST OFFICE to pick up supplies.</comment>

<comment>Because the USPS has a monopoly on such services in the town perhaps?</comment>

<comment>nonsense.  anyone is free to open a competitor if they think they can make a buck  out there</comment>

<comment>Part of the reason that the USPS is not profitable is because it operates in pretty much every town in the country, even rural spots like this that no private enterprise would find it economically feasible to serve.</comment>

<comment>The USPS is struggling with profitablety because of the work of lobbyist and the politicians that voted for guaranteed benefits for the employees. Which is good however 150 years per person is excessive and was intentional to undermine the service in favor of the private sector.  I  have yet to hear of any one living 150 years in this country.</comment>

<comment>And let's be clear: not only is the federal ownership of land Constitutionally-sanctioned, it's a longstanding tradition in the country that goes back to the time of the founding. The federal government has owned land since the inception of the republic. This is not some sort of new, modern day encroachment.</comment>

<comment>Right, it goes back thousands of years. Royalty had "the King's lands" where they could do anything they wanted, particularly hunt.</comment>

<comment>The feds have always owned that land. They never took it from private citizens unless you count the Native Americans who they stole it from.</comment>

<comment>They didn't "steal" it from the Native Americans so much as they murdered the owner's.Killing everyone with a claim to the land seems a smidgen more horrible than just outright stealing it...</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but at least the private property owner wanted them to it, right?  And I'm sure they did the removal with their own equipment, and not stolen government tools, right?</comment>

<comment>That's lovely! It looks like a beautiful place. We had some birders ask to use our church parking lot one winter a few years back (long story). We thought there'd be a car or two, and that they might wait for a break in the weather. The next thing I knew, there were 20 people standing on the median strip next to the parking lot, in over 2 feet of snow, and temps in the single digits. They were VERY serious about their birding!</comment>

<comment>Yeah "bird people" are not to be screwed with.</comment>

<comment>I think the author here is correct that the sheen of the Bundys is wearing thin.  My concern is that this will only make them madder and more likely to get violent.  Tough guys (their idea) who become laughing stocks generally need to prove how tough they are.  They're unlikely to go with their tails between their legs.  And this could be ugly.</comment>

<comment>These self-styled militia are not protesters or patriots, they are domestic terrorists who have engaged in seditious conspiracy in Nevada and Oregon.  They should be forced to lay down their guns and surrender, and then arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  No way they get to say "oops" and go home.</comment>

<comment>In addition to not paying (incredibly cheap) fees to graze, the bundy clan degraded public land from severe overgrazing (over double the number of cattle per acre of grassland) in NV, much as the OR family damaged land through arson and illegal hunting.  These sort are looking for a free ride at the public's expense and won't leave property - either their own or publicly owned - in good repair.  These carpetbaggers are textbook cases for publicly managed land to remain publicly managed.</comment>

<comment>These people are not dangerous like Nichols and McVeigh.  I don't know what everyone's so nervous about.  If a jayvee team puts on Lakers uniforms that doesn’t make them Kobe Bryant.</comment>

<comment>If they don't eventually arrest every single one of these terrorist, they will only do it again in the future.  Take them out by any means possible.</comment>

<comment>Of course I understand the Atlantic is all pro leftist media, what a drag are you all with your PC words and all that shit from your marxists minds.You think you can influence people but you can't, the hearts of the people are more down to earth based than your comfortable farting minds</comment>

<comment>Voters in western states oppose the federal government turning over control of its western landholdings to states or private entities: https://www.coloradocollege.ed...</comment>

<comment>Polls ? Don't make me laughAnyways you start giving up the private property and end up giving up your own self, which is what governments want.Public land, Bureau of this ,bureau of that, come on, you  all listened to This land is my land...and bought a lie</comment>

<comment>There's no lie behind public lands. As someone who has utilized public lands all my life, I recognize the incredible value they offer. And I will defend them, because I recognize their value -- much like those in the western states that have consistently expressed support for federal public lands.</comment>

<comment>You can even fart in it for all I care.</comment>

<comment>What's more sinister than zombies? More zombies?</comment>

<comment>SSM zombies.</comment>

<comment>Yes, because the zombies used during the fall of Constantinople are returning. How high were you when you made that comment?</comment>

<comment>That, as you state, is true which is the reason why if Constantinople was the second Rome, Moscow will be the third.</comment>

<comment>Wait, what?</comment>

<comment>LSD is a helluva drug, son.</comment>

<comment>Where the hell is Rome, Moscow?  Are you still high?</comment>
