<comment>Executive summary:War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery, Diversity is StrengthWith apologies to George Orwell for the substitution at the end there.</comment>

<comment>When you knuckleheads quote Orwell, do you realize you're quoting an unapologetic, lifelong socialist?</comment>

<comment>And that invalidates the quote how exactly?</comment>

<comment>Well, among other things, socialists are not generally opposed to diversity.</comment>

<comment>That is precisely what makes it so powerful, because it is something they believe, but I've placed it after two other statements we recognize to be lies.  In other words I'm saying diversity isn't strength and that quite the opposite it can be dangerous when you have a society composed of different elements with fundamental ideological differences.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I got it. It just isn't quite as "powerful" as you may think.</comment>

<comment>White people must listen to Obama's unique perspective.</comment>

<comment>The guy who grew up in the upper middle class, and went to private school.</comment>

<comment>Corruption and deception is not a unique position for democrats.  The only reason he is not in jail is because of black privilege.Obama will go down as the worst president in history hell bent on destroying America from within.</comment>

<comment>Unique means:  Only Muslim Socialst American President.Don't worry, we have been listening.</comment>

<comment>Along with most Americans I will not be watching this farce tonight.</comment>

<comment>I won't.  It will only anger me.</comment>

<comment>Tell us when we've been better off under a recent Republican president?</comment>

<comment>Terrorist  and criminals have no better friends than Obama and the Democrat Party. They prove to be the biggest threat this nation has ever faced.</comment>

<comment>I am going to go out on a limb here and say you support the terrorist in Oregon.</comment>

<comment>I don't need to watch the State of the Union to watch him lie. He does that during every interview.</comment>

<comment>So how were we better off under recent republican presidents?</comment>

<comment>Because Silly Liberals believed those lies.</comment>

<comment>So you have no examples.  Thanks for agreeing.</comment>

<comment>The poster above is called "Silly Liberals."</comment>

<comment>I know.  That's why it's so amusing, and telling.</comment>

<comment>Highlights of the last year? Are they joking?</comment>

<comment>I should have known.  The comment thread has already featured a string of nasty, racist, paranoid expressions.Unlike these willfully ignorant people, I will watch President Obama and reflect upon the hysteria that greeted each wave of American immigrants.  People were terrified of the Irish.  The Irish would destroy America.  Italians would destroy America.  Jews - forgetaboutit.  And so forth.Now we're convinced that Muslims and Mexicans will destroy America.  Superpacs are running ads declaring that we need "white" immigrants, not, Those Other People.I am ashamed of this backwards element in American society.  Flat out ashamed of you guys (you know who you are.)Also, my ancestors suffered the depredations of bigots who thought we were sub-human.  People used to look at America with hope and respect.G*d knows what the world thinks of us now.</comment>

<comment>Don't lump Christian Mexicans with followers of the Islam cult.</comment>

<comment>Excuse me, I'm not the one who is lumping Mexicans of any faith or no faith in with ISIS terrorists.That would be Trump and Cruz and their followers, who need their heads examined.For that matter it is absurd to lump Syrian or Iraqi or North African or other refugees in general in with the terrorists who have destroyed their countries.</comment>

<comment>White people just need to stop. They need to stop and realize they are on the wrong side of history. The future of America is diversity. Diversity will make us so strong.</comment>

<comment>Racist?  Racist how?  If someone is black, it's impossible for them to be corrupt and inept?  Is that what you're trying to say here?I'm a minority as well, and my view of this man is that he's done everything humanly possible to promote the wrongs of Islam throughout the world.And, hello, I'm not Muslim.  </comment>

<comment>Oh for heaven's sake.  Of course it is possible for ANY person of any color to be corrupt, inept, whatever.  Obama is none of the above and you darn well know it.And as for "promoting the wrongs of Islam," that's a bizarre thing to say!Obama has, and he's right in this, tried to promote tolerance, peace and understanding.Meanwhile, though, we have cheerleaders for all-out war here in the US.That's a real big help.Not.PS gee.  You're not Muslim?  Who would have gotten the idea that you are Muslim?  You've made so many bigoted comments it never occurred to me that you are Muslim, to be honest.  You sound like a "Christian" to me.  Please note the quotation marks.Jesus is rolling in his grave at what's become of "Christians" under the banner of the far right wing.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm an agnostic.  And I'm also female, and don't find it amusing that at my expense, at the expense of women, liberals are singing kumbaya with Muslims, humoring their Koran, looking away at the horrors and atrocities they're committing worldwide, and ignoring the fact that wherever these people have gone, women have ended up victimized at their expense, on the women's own dime.Right now, the only ones who give a damn about preserving the freedom of women in the West, rather than bringing in the sick influence of the Koran and inviting in Muslim hordes, are conservatives.  Liberals have gone nuts or no longer stand for women.</comment>

<comment>The women in this world need to work together in order to make the world we women live in, a safer place. If one person is not safe then none of us is safe.I will be happy to have a Kumbaya moment with any women of any culture and that would include a muslim woman. Now if you want to talk about terrorist behavior that is another issue and I can assure you that the muslim population did not invent it.Remember the Irish do not go to a fight with out a big gun.Now work with me here because I have been and still am working for you and every women younger then myself and you.You need to pull it together because you and all women need me and others like me.I am your unknown best friend and I am fighting for your rights and you are keening toward fascism.I am one women who kicks (expletive deleted) for any women in my presence that gets messed with.</comment>

<comment>OOOPS - didn't mean this response to you!!!  Was for that other person who hates Muslims, etc:)</comment>

<comment>Is your opinion directed at me or Sarita?</comment>

<comment>Sarita - my apologies.  I copied it and linked it to her comment.</comment>

<comment>I get passionate and am serious about justice.  Thank you for your contribution. We just need to keep working together.</comment>

<comment>Thank YOU.By the way President Obama's speech was phenomenal and moving, I think.</comment>

<comment>I agree and the others can not stand that he does not take their bate lol.</comment>

<comment>Did you see the "debate" last night?</comment>

<comment>Shame on you for standing behind people whose very goal is the destruction of the Jewish people.  You obviously are completely ignorant about the history of Israel, and everything that has happened since.  Perhaps you're aiming to becoming a sort of Mother Teresa.  I'm pretty shocked to find this out about you.I have watched Obama, and not only is he inexperienced (though an excellent thespian), but I'm more convinced than ever that it was a huge mistake that I voted for him twice.</comment>

<comment>Oh brother.  Like I believe you give a hoot about women, Jews, or that you are an Obama voter.C'mon man.  Stop your lying.You know darn well who has actually come close to exterminating the Jewish people and it isn't Muslims.Stop lying.  Just stop it.</comment>

<comment>Oh!  Now that's interesting!  I guess now I'm not female, huh?  Neo-Wacko-Liberalism has gone to your head</comment>

<comment>I will be very happy to have you move yourself to a Muslim country and train them there to be civilized.  Not f up my country, and endanger my life.</comment>

<comment>Well I'm a woman too, also an agnostic, and a feminist, and I'm worried about the future of women's rights also. However, I think the way to confront this is not to be fearful and biased against everybody who is Muslim - because a great deal of this is cultural, predates Islam, and transcends religion in many regions of the world. Also there are paternalistic woman haters in every religion and every culture; we have them here too.So, I think we have to keep working to educate people about human rights. One of the Scandinavian countries is doing precisely that because they're concerned that cultural mores and signals are misread by recent immigrants and immigrant communities, especially toward women. In some parts of the world it's considered very risque just to show female hair, so the sight of Western women in short dresses is misread as an invitation.I think, with respect, you're mistaking a desire for tolerance and a desire to avoid the terrible aspects of bigotry with "kumbaya."My people are Jewish. We got almost wiped out in Europe because people said this and said that about us, and stereotyped all Jews, some people in fact still do that - I read and hear antisemitic comments all the time.So, when I hear blanket stereotypes of Muslims or any other group of people I stand up against it.That isn't singing kumbaya or ignoring women's rights or anything else - it's simply standing up for decency, for being a human being.And I think you should watch the State of the Union with an open mind and an open heart, bearing in mind what I'm trying to say here.</comment>

<comment>No, YOU take your "open heart" to a Muslim country, and carry out your little experiments there.  "Educate" Muslims over there.  Do your "social works" there.  And leave the rest of us Western women here with our freedoms.  We will not allow you to take them away simply because you've declared yourself Mother Teresa II.</comment>

<comment>Nobody is going to take away your "freedoms," unless you inspire other Americans to be hateful and full of fear.That's a fact.By the way I wish you'd watched President Obama.  He spoke far more eloquently than I ever could about American ideals.Please, take the cotton out of your ears and the fear and hatred out of your heart and listen to him.</comment>

<comment>You betcha nobody is going to take away my freedoms here as a female, because if I have any say in it, Islam and Shariah will remain in the hellholes it belongs in the Middle East.I know he speaks well.  He's a true thespian.  In fact, that's the only reason he was suggested to run for office.  Everyone heard the speech at the DNC Convention where he gave the famous speech, and gave it so well, that people suggested he should run for office, and the rest is bad, bad history.  I've been a lib all my life.  He impressed me with his speech-giving skills.  </comment>

<comment>Kim Davis, the religious whack job that defied a US Supreme Court Court Order to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and subsequently went to jail for contempt is claiming he is attending the Presidents State of the Union Address How is this so???</comment>

<comment>Obviously invited by some whackjob Republican.</comment>

<comment>Kim Davis is a woman.  She is probably invited to attend as a guest of a tea party member of Congress.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps Congressman Steve Russell could show up with the shredded records from Jaster's ranger class.</comment>

<comment>Jut out of curiosity, does anyone know if Refaai Hamo is an Alawite?</comment>

<comment>"As my colleague Russell Berman noted, Tuesday night’s State of the Union address will highlight the administration’s accomplishments, in an effort to bolster the Democrats running on his record in 2016. But it’s also the start of a “long goodbye.”"Accomplishments?  I see them as Muslim accomplishments.  Goodbye?  I see it as good riddance.  And obviously this man is an expert at surrounding himself with feel-good people.  He's an ace at it.</comment>

<comment>Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound? What on Earth can you possibly mean by "Muslim accomplishments?" Nevermind, your answer won't make any sense. And before you get going, yes, I approve of Islamic terrorism and hope that ISIS blows up my place of business while gang-raping me because I approve of gay marriage.</comment>

<comment>He's done a great deal of damage.  Enjoy fooling yourself about it.</comment>

<comment>Well let's see, last time a president turned over the keys we had two significant wars going and the economy was in shambles. So if I'm fooling myself by thinking things are better now, I'm ok with that. BTW, why don't you ever respond to what's actually written in the comments? I asked what are "Muslim accomplishments?" Or is that just one of those things like "The Alinsky Playbook" that you people spout without having any idea what the hell you actually mean, because it sounds sinister?</comment>

<comment>But now after 8 years of Obama we're doing swimmingly well, huh?  There's poverty, lots of fast food jobs and not much else, but we're doing great.  Is that what you're impressed by?  No war, and HEY, we've got fast food jobs out the wazoo.</comment>

<comment>The fact that Republicans act as if a slow recovery is as bad as driving the economy to the brink of total ruin with a combination of tax cuts for the wealthy, deregulation that abetted massive fraud in the housing market and two thoroughly unfunded wars is just crazy. Let me guess... you aren't actually one of the people in poverty, or working a fast food job, right? I'm guessing you've only heard about how bad the economy is. As your comments below suggest (politically aware people watch the State of the Union regardless of party affiliation, btw), you shelter yourself from information that contradicts your political perspective. Thus, you are gleaning that information strictly from people whose entire political future rests on convincing voters that everything is going into the toilet. In 2008, as you may recall, people didn't have to hear about the carnage wrought by failed Bush-era economic policies because everybody felt the pain at least a little. By contrast, you are sitting here lamenting the plight of fast food workers, but I bet you don't support many policies that would help fast food workers out, and I'd also bet that you aren't personally acquainted with any of the fast food workers whose plight you lament.</comment>

<comment>And the moving of jobs abroad, thanks to Clinton's signing of GATT and NAFTA, which, of course, never gets mentioned because he's a Democrat, least of all by you.As for the fast food jobs (which are literally everywhere - hooray Obama!), where are the good jobs going to come from?  Or are they here already and hiding?</comment>

<comment>Well, if I joined your sentiment that GATT or NAFTA hurt the economy in the same ways that abetting fraud in the housing market or starting massive unfunded wars did, I'd point out that NAFTA was initially negotiated and signed by Bush I and passed both houses of Congress under Clinton, but with more support from Republicans than Democrats. GATT is actually a series of multilateral agreements dating back to the 40's and, the WTO (which was the major outcome of the GATT round under Clinton) is ineffectual, but hardly can be said to have harmed devastated our economy. Nope, there's a pretty broad consensus that we have the banking industry to thank for that (along with ourselves, irresponsible borrowers that we are), and that wild spending coupled with tax cuts compounded the problem. We are part of a globalizing economy. I realize that going back to the gold standard or reinstating the tariff may appeal to some people, but to me it's about as reasonable as the Navy starting to build wooden ships again.</comment>

<comment>And if it were reversed, and a Republican had signed GATT and NAFTA, all of a sudden your view of things would be that GATT and NAFTA are responsible for most of our ills.The fact is, corporations finance BOTH, Democrats and Republicans.  In fact, both parties depend upon corporate financing to run for office.  What we have, in essence, is a third and far more powerful political party in this country: corporations.Democrats and Republicans are beholden to corporations because they depend on them to run for office, since the cost of running for office in this country is prohibitive.That said, these days I find that while Republicans are not exactly the height of compassion, Democrats are just outright batsh*t CRAZY, insane, and irrational, which is why I re-registered as Republican.  The Islamic problem brought it all home for me.  The way that Democrats are behaving with regard to this issue (treating them like helpless little victims, willing to embrace as many as possible into this country) is simply sick and unacceptable to me.  In the 1400 years Muslims have been around practicing their Koranic beliefs, not 1 year have they treated females as human beings.  Unacceptable.  At this moment, for me, nothing, and I do mean nothing else matters politically to me, so I will be voting Republican across the board until liberals continue to behave that insane way.</comment>

<comment>I do not generally change my views on particular policies based on who is advocating them, so no, I wouldn't think GATT and NAFTA were bad if Republicans had supported them. In fact, what I pointed out is that Republicans were more in favor of NAFTA than Democrats, yet I think both were probably good ideas overall. I certainly don't blame either treaty for ruining the economy in 2008 (though you do, if your comments are to be believed), though the extent of global interconnection that they represent was reflected in the crisis of 2008, which highlighted the way in which something like the US housing market could impact every corner of the global economy. I think that GW Bush is one of our worst presidents, not because he is a Republican, but because I consider the invasion of Iraq to have been premised on outright lies to the American public and, more importantly, part of a disastrous foreign policy. I also think that significant tax cuts are a bad idea when they (a) disproportionately benefit the wealthy and (b) are enacted at a time when the debt and deficits are soaring due to an unfunded (ill-advised) war.  Look, we don't disagree about the extent to which both parties are bought and sold by corporate interests. I think that the Republicans have traditionally been a bit more inclined to abet corporate sellouts on policy issues than Democrats, though there are vocal minorities in both parties that object vehemently to corporate dominance of Congress. For example, the largest corporate interests in the world are oil companies, and there's no denying how firmly in bed they are with the Republican status quo.As for Muslims, I think your concerns are irrational given that I'm not sure what Obama or other democrats have actually done to inspire such consternation. As far as I can tell, the policy objections are basically that Dems tend to favor the admission of small numbers of refugees from Syria (10,000 is the current number, and very much in keeping with our past practices under both D and R administrations concerning refugees and asylum-seekers) and that the administration negotiated the nuclear deal with Iran. The rest is rhetoric, and while I don't have any particular aversion to calling Islamic terrorism "Islamic" I also understand what commentators mean when they say ISIS does not "represent" most of the Islamic world. That's true. Most of the Islamic world does not feel the way ISIS does about the west, nor does it embrace their barbaric views about how society ought to be structured. I also think that we live in a free society that is large and vibrant enough to contain people of any number of religious perspectives, including those with which I strongly disagree. The founders of this country who wrote the constitution agreed with me, if the first amendment can be taken at face value. As an atheist, I frankly have no dog in the fight. But it seems that some people like yourself will not be satisfied until a politician says all Muslims ought to be deported, or that Islam is an evil religion and all of its practitioners are awful people with backward views of society, or, let's be honest, that you'd prefer that they were all dead. I know and am friends with Muslims who don't beat their wives, or make them wear burqas, or look down on me for a Friday night cocktail or think that my atheism makes me a subhuman. The Islamic world has many problems, including the retrograde attitudes that concern you. But this country was literally founded, more than anything else, on the principle of religious freedom. It's why people came here in the first place. So acting like invocations of religious tolerance are an endorsement of ISIS or al Qaeda, or an expression of hatred for gays, women or any other group, is just nuts. And, if it makes you feel any better, the president has superintended the killing of many, many Muslims during his 8 years in office, so if that's what you look for in a politician, maybe you should look at the record rather than some cartoon version of what Democrats believe or endorse.</comment>

<comment>I think it's truly unbelievable the extent to which you will go to pretend that Islam, its history, the Koran, and the behaviors of Muslims in the 1400 years since mohammed invented this sick cult, are just like anything else.  You will do or say anything to defend Muslims, and for the life of me I cannot understand why, unless you're a Muslim yourself.I'm an immigrant.  My country of birth has always had intervention, most of it bad - the Spanish, and then the U.S.  Horrible things happened in my country.  Horrible.  Deaths, hunger, poverty.  However, we do NOT take our anger and learn to fly planes and fly them into high rises to kill Americans.  We do not shoot cartoonists.  We do not throw gays off roofs.  We do not treat women like beasts of burden that should be beaten, tortured, stoned, their genitals removed, etc. etc. and etc.   If we have anger (which we don't because we look upon life differently from the way sicko Muslims do), we proceed forward with our lives, enjoy them, love our family members, and marvel in the thing called life.Meanwhile, Muslims are different.  Psychopathically different.  Even the ones that commit no murders or tortures, were raised with what is the sickest, most sadistic cult on the planet, so their minds tend to side with the hatred of non-Muslims, hatred of non-Jews, violent view of life.  The list of atrocities Muslims commit and have committed in the 1400 years of their existence, is interminable, and the terrorists aren't camel riders with no education.  These are often highly educated.  Please stop pretending I'm an idiot who can be talked into joining you in your support of a truly sick ideology which is fighting a war against EVERYONE on the planet.  I find it insulting that you should 1) pretend Muslims are just like anybody else; and, 2) try to shove that bs idea down my throat.</comment>

<comment>You got some froth on your shirt. But thanks for the lesson on how Cubans have never done anything violent or nasty because of their generally sunny dispositions and love of life. I mean, reading your posts, who could mistake that live and let live attitude? P.S. I'm not pretending that you're an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Are you denying that Cubans do not attack the U.S.?  Are you STILL entrenched in your justification of modern Muslim atrocities by blaming it on the U.S.?  And btw, how do you justify Muslim atrocities prior to the existence of the U.S.?  That certain creates a conundrum for you.</comment>

<comment>Why on earth would I need to justify anybody's atrocities? I haven't committed any atrocities so I figure I'm cool on that front. Get some help. You have an obsession at best, and some serious pathology at worst.</comment>

<comment>Isn't that precisely what you have been doing by defending them?</comment>

<comment>If saying that I don't blame all 1.57 billion Muslims for the actions of extremist groups like ISIS or al Qaeda (preferring to blame, y'know, ISIS or al Qaeda), or pointing out that this country was undeniably founded on religious liberty, or refusing to label one of the world's largest religions a "death cult" amounts to justifying atrocities then sure, I'm justifying atrocities. Look, you obviously can't see past your own irrationality on this subject, so I'm gonna sign off here. Good luck getting through your days believing that 23% of the world is part of a murderous death cult. And that's not even counting all of the other terrible people out there running around, who wouldn't know the Koran from Dianetics.</comment>

<comment>I know Muslims who aren't wearing any bomb belts.  However, they were raised learning the Koran, which says some pretty horrific things that no other religion quite compares with.  This is quite a cult.  Its treatment of females in all 1400 years has continued being savage.  I'm not even counting how it treats its gays, etc.And FYI, the terrorists we hear about who spent time in Western countries were considered very friendly by Westerners prior to these Muslims' committing of atrocities.Again, I don't comprehend the need to defend a religion so heinous, to which so many have been exposed to.  And by the way, I don't know about you, but Nazis who didn't actually kill people, still believed in it, and not all spent the whole time mouthing off about it.You have a very understanding way about Islam that I'll bet good $ you do not have about Christianity and myriad other institutions, groups and people.</comment>

<comment>I'm an accepting person as a general matter and I spend almost none of my day worrying about terrorists of any ideology because, as a general matter, there are much more imminent dangers to worry about. As for how I regard other groups or institutions, I am a huge believer in both prongs of the first amendment's religion clauses. Everyone should have the right to believe and practice as they see fit, so long as those practices do not offend the religiously-neutral law of the land, and the state should not act for or endorse any particular religion. IOW, I'm for free exercise, with no establishment of religion. As for Muslims and their history, I've spent a fair amount of time studying it, and studying world history in general, and I can say with confidence that Islam is hardly unique or uniquely prodigious in inspiring extreme violence on the part of its adherents. Any serious examination of world history leads to this conclusion. Does it have it's own peculiarities or offensive doctrines? Sure. But the reason western values appear to conflict with much of fundamentalist Islamic dogma is because western values conflict with harsh religious dogma as a general matter. Those ideas were formed, in large part, as a conscious rejection of our own rigid oppressive brands of religious dogma (read up on the Thirty Years War if you want some gruesome examples). Women haven't even had the vote in this country for 100 years yet, based in part on suppositions about women's roles and abilities dating back to at least St. Paul. Yet to hear you tell it, Islam is unique in its mistreatment of and disdain for women. A serious appraisal of human history should lead you to conclude not that those traits you identify in many Islamic societies are acceptable or that Islamic societies have typically been enlightened, free places by modern western standards, but rather that modern western standards of how humans ought to treat one another are shockingly new in human history, and that we've often fallen shockingly short of living up to those ideals in our own right. Thus we have things like (as you point out, without any apparent irony) the rise of fascism in the heart of modern Europe and the death of 50 million people as a result, the development of technology purposely designed to destroy much of life on the planet, yet you will sit there and act as if Muslims invented or perfected violence and human misery. The point is not apologizing for Islamic terrorism or even some of the more retrograde practices common in their culture. The point isn't even that our own failings as a society mean we can't be critical. The point is that writing-off a quarter of the world's population simply because some portion of them hold backward, terrible views is an act of supreme forgetfulness about what damage we in the west have wrought on the world in the last 200 years or so, enlightenment values notwithstanding. Now please, try to understand the difference between justifying Islamic fanaticism and violence (since I abhor fanaticism and violence in all it's forms, including the Islamic variety), and pointing out that our society is strongest when it seeks to convince people of a better way rather than killing those people who hold wrong beliefs. In any case, the answer to hatred is not more hatred and, make no mistake, you are peddling hatred.</comment>

<comment>You said:  “I'm an accepting person as a general matter and I spend almost none of my day worrying about terrorists of any ideology because, as a general matter, there are much more imminent dangers to worry about.”Oh really.  Only if one sees Muslims as just ordinary run-of-the-mill, which is what you’ve been trying to convince me of throughout several posts in which you’ve engaged in bs lies to promote your favorite people, the sadists, Muslims.Then you said:  “In any case, the answer to hatred is not more hatred and, make no mistake, you are peddling hatred.”Oh?  It’s hatred to hate sadists? Do you suffer from deep-seated wish to have been born Mother Teresa?  I don’t.  I happen to like my life and don’t want the likes of you attempting to destroy it by bringing in sadist hordes.Then you said:  “As for Muslims and their history, I've spent a fair amount of time studying it, and studying world history in general,  and I can say with confidence that Islam is hardly unique or uniquely prodigious in inspiring extreme violence on the part of its adherents.”I doubt you’ve studied anything.  You’re either Muslim,or you’re one of those liberals who adore chaos and destroying the Western country you enjoy.  (Because for sure you will never move to a Muslim one, will you? Oh nosiree, you’re not that dumb)!Even if one were so kind as to disregard the sheer violence in the Koran, the acts of Muslims from 610 to the present, acts which are committed by Muslims upon people worldwide are enough to condemn it.  Stop the lies.The rest of your response is pure lies and false equivalencies.  Muslims have had a violent history from beginning to present.  The countries they acquired (the entire Middle East, for ex.) were Christian and Pagan, and these were acquired by some of the most gruesome atrocities known to humanity, which is why the current ancestors of those people are now Muslim.Seriously, I read through your entire false equivalencies essay, and it is nothing but that.  Liberals use that all the time.  “Oh but other people have been violent too!”   Well, I live in 2015, and the people who were committing atrocities back in 610, are committing them today, only far more widely spread than ever.Let me say this now.  Every time a liberal starts with the lies and moral equivalencies to defend Muslims, it has one effect - to reinforce the fact that I have distanced myself from liberals.  In fact, if it frustrates me at all, it is to anger me that I did not switch to Republican sooner than I did.  It's likely I will never again vote for a liberal, as long as liberals continue to spew the pro-sadist, pro-misogyny, pro-Koran, pro-chaos crap.  Perhaps I ought to thank you for assuring me that my decisions are well taken.And on that note, since I have seen you do nothing but commit yourself to taqiyya, this conversation has now ended.  When I see you move to a Muslim country so you can back up just how incredibly civilized Muslims and non-sadist Muslims are, perhaps I will listen.  If you decide to do that, please don't forget to write!</comment>

<comment>You are ignorant and unwell. Good day.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that description applies to you.</comment>

<comment>Amen.</comment>

<comment>sg77,The hatred in the comments I read  is a reflection of the wounded souls writing.I had my share of challenges growing up.  However I realize that some of the commentators have been wounded beyond their own ability to recovery at this time.  People born in the forties and fifties experienced a lot of home chaos and negative parenting and are hurting as a result.Many people back in that time did not recognize the damage and effect of emotional abuse. The emotional abuse of yesterday and today, is the family disfunction of today.Family disfunction is the gift that just keeps on giving. Have a pleasant weekend sg777.Thank you for your compassion and understanding about the human condition.Susan</comment>

<comment>Back at you Susan!  Take care - hope to see you again.PS you have a point about the forties & fifties.  Thanks for your insights and your wisdom.  I hadn't thought of this phenomenon in those terms before.</comment>

<comment>I'll be watching. Sounds like a different, and interesting, approach to a state of the Union speech. I'm going to have a much nicer evening than some of the sad, bilious posters below.</comment>

<comment>The nerve of this man... going up there and giving Congress information of the State of the Union and recommending to their Consideration such measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient. Now is as likely a time as any for him to refuse to lay down the presidency, name himself dictator for life, and declare that the US is now going to engage in solar-powered jihad against Western civilization.</comment>
