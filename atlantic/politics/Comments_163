<comment>The GOP elite are clueless and they are about to get what they deserve.</comment>

<comment>For once I agree with you, but as a liberal. David Frum curiously detaches himself from the Republican establishment. The GOP mainstream largely caused the middle-class economic decline that Frum now calls on the party to exploit in order to win.</comment>

<comment>In terms of his odd sense of detachment from the thing he's part of, Frum didn't apply for US citizenship until after 9/11.</comment>

<comment>Frum isn't running for President.</comment>

<comment>Not my point. My point is that Frum has a way of pretending his not part of something he's actually substantively a part of. Like the GOP establishment. Like the American government (he was part of the White House staff, and had lived in the USA for over 20 years, before it took something like 9/11 to trigger a "oh, it's time to become an American citizen" epiphany. Except one wonders if it was more to avoid the awkwardness at dinner parties having to answer the question "When did you become one of us, David?".... (Very awkward when you're part of a communications campaign that's devoted to separating loyal sheep from disployal goats.) Still hasn't really embraced the reality of his profound errors in judgment over the Iraq War, and pretends that he doesn't need to. He's one odd duck.</comment>

<comment>Not my point.Then it must be a SQUIRREL point. You might try looking up what an ad hominem is.http://www.nizkor.org/features...</comment>

<comment>Actually, your point is, "I have nothing useful to add to the discussion so I'll attack the author with irrelevant personal details."</comment>

<comment>David Frum is a mainstream Republican, but smarter. His vision of an ideal world is some imagined 50s utopia where everyone listened to the rich white men is suits and ties and nothing was complicated or hard and everyone felt happy and secure as worker bees. He's smart enough to realize, though, that the current GOP is so greedy that they're threatening the vision they try to sell.The more they squeeze the working and middle class to create cartoonish levels of wealth for themselves, the more they invite a populist uprising. We're used to think of that as coming from the left (socialism, communism) but as Trump is showing, there's a rich vein of that on the right, and it's even more dangerous, because then it comes with racism or end-of-days religious fantasies, or something more extreme.</comment>

<comment>Both you and Frum are missing the real story.Disenchantment with Obama and his policies to "fundamentally transform" this country prompted Americans to vote out Democrats and put in Republicans who were supposed to curb some of Obama's wilder ambitions, such as importing hundreds of thousands of Syrians who couldn't be vetted.The GOP Congress could have used the power of the purse to defund the refugee resettlement program, among others. Instead, "leaders" like Boehner, McConnell and Ryan cut backroom deals with Harry Reid, approving omnibus bills that basically gave Obama everything he wanted.So Trump's popularity isn't about Republicans "squeezing the working and middle class," because Obama and the Democrats have already done that for the past 7 years. That's why the median household income is worse today than when he took office.What it boils down to are policies that, among other things, treat immigrants better than citizens -- resulting in, for instance, military veterans, waiting months and even years to be seen at a VA hospital, while illegal immigrants get government benefits.A vote for Trump is a middle finger in the face of the political establishment -- not only the Obama administration, but the Vichy Republicans who've demonstrated that their election to Congress was merely a case of "Meet the new boss, same as the old boss."</comment>

<comment>A vote for Trump is chopping off the nose in an effort to spite the face of the political establishment.The thing is, way too many people from across the entire polical spectrum feel like the "others" are having their way and "we" are losing out, when in fact a tiny number of people are playing a massive game of misdirection and sneaking off with the prizes.  If we could scrape together a few hours of honest civility and compare notes we'd probably find that most folks are mad at the same group.</comment>

<comment>Could be, if the group in question consists of the political elites of D.C.I don't know that Trump is the answer, but on the other hand, if every other politician seems to be bought and paid for -- or acting according to their own party's agenda, as opposed the the will of the people -- I can't blame the populace for flipping off the establishment candidates, as the voters of both parties appear to be doing with Trump and Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>There's so much wrong in this paragraph its hard to comprehend. Please don't vote.</comment>

<comment>Is there a point hiding somewhere within your post, or is throwing spitballs from the cheap seats the extent of your ability to fashion a counterargument?</comment>

<comment>Well, Obama never had any plans to take in "hundreds of thousands" of Syrian immigrants and there are no policies that treat immigrants better than citizens (despite that being a wildly popular facebook meme). Trump appeals to the id of his supporters with empty, but tough-sounding, proclamations, placing the blame for all their woes (both real and imaginary) on the easiest, most powerless targets. He's a faux populist who is clever enough to keep his propaganda simple enough for everyone to understand.</comment>

<comment>1Pokey4 said: "Well, Obama never had any plans to take in "hundreds of thousands" of Syrian immigrants ..."Well, that's interesting, since that great conservative radio network, NPR, reported the following last September: http://www.npr.org/sections/th..."Secretary of State John Kerry is pledging that the United States will significantly increase the number of migrants it accepts over the next two years, ratcheting up to 100,000 annually by 2017."Hey, I'm a doctor, Jim, not a mathematician, but it seems to me that "100,000 annually by 2017" would fit the description of "hundreds of thousands."1Pokey4 said: "Trump appeals to the id of his supporters with empty, but tough-sounding, proclamations, placing the blame for all their woes (both real and imaginary) on the easiest, most powerless targets."I wouldn't describe the average Muslim refugees as "powerless targets" -- especially the young men with a predilection for forming mobs that treat the women and teenage girls like squeeze toys in Western cities like Cologne.Seems to me that the real "powerless targets" here would be the females with handprints all over their intimate areas, but gee, maybe you can pose a credible argument that by not dressing in burqas, they secretly wanted it.</comment>

<comment>Your claim was "hundreds of thousands of Syrians". Your linked story doesn't support that. It quotes Kerry as saying 100,000 total refugees per year, not 100,000 Syrians. The US takes in refugees from countries across the world, many more than just Syria. If you read more than the very first paragraph of your linked story, you would have seen the total annual count of Syrian refugees will be less than 40,000 by 2017.</comment>

<comment>Where do you get "less than 40,000 a year"? If you'd read more than the very first paragraph of my linked story, you would have seen this report from the Associate Press: "Many, though not all, of the additional refugees would be Syrian, American officials have said."So Kerry is already talking about 85,000 to 100,000 refugees a year, and his own staffers are saying that "many" of them will be Syrian. I can't define "many" in this instance and neither can you, but there's no reason to put that figure at 40,000.Besides, Kerry puts no end date on the acceptance of Syrian refugees, and by discussing 2017 policy, he's already talking about the post-Obama era. So the next president could choose to continue the program through January 2021, which could easily add up to hundreds of thousands of Syrians.Rather than split hairs over the numbers, however, I'd suggest paying more attention to the fact that Obama's own intelligence directors say we have no way of properly vetting Syrian refugees.* James Clapper, Director of National Intelligence: “I don’t, obviously, put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among these refugees, so that’s a huge concern of ours.”* James Comey, FBI Director: “If we don’t know much about somebody, there won’t be anything in our data. I can’t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this."If only 9 attackers could kill 130 people in Paris and wound more than 300 others, and our government can't do background checks on Syrian refugees, then what sane nation would consider taking in tens of thousands of them?</comment>

<comment>The US takes less than 10,000 Syrian refugees per year, out of the total of approximately 70,000 refugees per year the US takes in. So even if all the additional 30,000 were Syrians, that would be less than 40,000 per year.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but Kerry talked about 100,000 refugees a year, "many" of them Syrians. Again, I don't pretend to be able to quantify "many."But in this day and age, no sane leader of a Western nation would take 40,000 or even 10,000 so-called Syrian refugees, given the fact that the majority are young men, our intelligence agencies can't vet them, and the Cologne experience shows how incompatible their misogynistic culture is with Western societies.</comment>

<comment>No, you are misreading. He said many of the ADDITIONAL refugees would be Syrians.And I completely disagree with your second paragraph. The "Cologne experience" demonstrates nothing of the sort. It demonstrates that work absolutely must be done to acclimatize refugees from societies that haven't had the benefit of sixty years of feminism. Canada, with a population 1/10 of the US is on track to take in an average of 12,500 Syrian refugees for last year and this year without problems. The notion that the US couldn't safely absorb the same number of Syrian refugees as Canada is ludicrous.</comment>

<comment>OK, but as the New York Times states with more clarity, the number of "additional" refugees would rise to 30,000 if Kerry has his way:http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09...If "many" of those are Syrians -- or people who claim to be Syrians -- that's still a dangerously high number of refugees whom Obama's own intelligence officials admit that our government can't vet.To wit: Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said: “I don’t, obviously, put it past the likes of ISIL to infiltrate operatives among these refugees, so that’s a huge concern of ours.” And FBI Director James Comey said: “If we don’t know much about somebody, there won’t be anything in our data. I can’t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this.”Sure we could take more Syrians -- but why should we? You say that "The 'Cologne experience' ... demonstrates that work absolutely must be done to acclimatize refugees from societies that haven't had the benefit of sixty years of feminism."Come off it, do you seriously think that people who've been born and raised in the misogynistic culture of Middle East Islam -- where women are subjugated and gays are executed -- can be brought into 21st century Western society with a two-week diversity course?And in the meantime, how many additional rape and molestations of American women (and teenage girls) are you comfortable with? Virtually every Western European nation that's accepted thousands of Islamic refugees has experienced an increase in the number of sexual attacks on women.So why are Syrian refugees our responsibility, particularly since about 60 percent of them are young men? They should be fighting for their own country, not looking for a ticket to ours. If we want to help them, let's create a safe zone in Syria, buy them supplies and let them work it out.You wouldn't argue for the U.S. to take tens of thousands of KKK or Nazi refugees, so why should we accept thousands of refugees from a 7th-century religious culture that abuses women and gays? Let them evolve on their own time, not ours.  </comment>

<comment>It's a gross generalization to compare all Syrians to the KKK or the Nazis, and not worth debating.</comment>

<comment>Fine, don't debate that point, but it doesn't negate the rest of my post -- unless you simply can't handle the truth.Do you seriously believe that America needs tens of thousands more people who believe in female genital mutilation, honor killing, execution of homosexuals, a ban on alcohol, a prohibition on any speech that disparages Mohammed and other aspects of Sharia law?Because that's what you get with Islam. You may think you can send Middle East Muslims to charm school and transform them into hip Westerners, but there's plenty of evidence in Western Europe that would knock the PC stars out of your eyes if you were paying attention.Look at the growing number of Sharia courts in the UK (wow, what assimilation). Look at the increased rape rate in Sweden and how much of it stems from Muslim immigrants, not to mention the sexual abuse of women and little girls in Cologne and Rotherham, to name just two. Look at the Global Terrorism Index and the fact that the majority of all terrorism deaths can be attributed to Islamic groups.Feel free to cling to your PC myths if you like, but when the Obama administration's own intelligence directors say they can't vet Syrian refugees, only a naive fool (or a person who hates the United States) would want to import 10,000 of them.</comment>

<comment>The irony is, that IS the beast the GOP created. I.e. slander the president/opposition with crazy distortions, lies, and strawman arguments to keep your electorate angry. They got so angry, that... well now they're nuts. There's no way out of this for them. They built and stoked an electorate that hates the government. The best thing they could do to try and remove Trump is to embrace him. Convince people he is a politician and has been a politician for years. Maybe they'll turn on him then (but it'll be tough to convince anyone a person who says the things Trump says is a politician).But better yet, just take your lumps and split the party. Take the non-crazy people with you and move. You'll lose in 2016. You'll probably lose it badly, but you'll prevent a national disaster and actually be useful in 2020. Heck you'll be useful again between 2016 and 2020. Stop letting racists, anarchists, and theocrats hide behind your party name just to court their votes.</comment>

<comment>You spell better than most of the ill-informed trolls but you spout the same nonsense.  You'll get what you deserve, come November.</comment>

<comment>Ooh, sounds ominous!But why should I believe you're not an ill-informed troll, since all you've done so far is go playground on me? I don't see any thoughtful counterarguments in your post.</comment>

<comment>Partly, anyway.  And they definitely worked as hard as they could to create the distrust, fear, tribalism, and social fracturing we now see.</comment>

<comment>And pray tell how did they do that? It seems to me that the most immediate reason why our economy isn't doing well is because of the MORTGAGE DEBACLE, which, like FAILED OBAMACARE, is another failed Democrat initiative. Oh yeah, Republicans loved to talk about helping people buy houses and all that, but this lamebrained idea started inside the offices of HUD during the Clinton Administration.Own it.</comment>

<comment>The Democrat elites are about to anoint a lying crook former wife of a pervert President as their candidate.  I guess they were given the clues but failed to act, indicating the Democrats are definitely not clueless.</comment>

<comment>Says who?Go Sanders.:)</comment>

<comment>I am by no means a HRC fan, but "wife of a pervert?" That's one of the more lame and assinine attempts at smearing someone I can think of. Not to mention an accusation that is by no means unique to HRC.Give the smearing a rest and try approaching the conversation intelligently for a change.</comment>

<comment>Pervert? Try disbarred, impeached, disgraced, perjurer and serial adulterer.Throw in grifter, goniff, money-laundering racketeer and those are his good sides). (That doesn't make him a pervert, though.  Let's be fair about this.  The Clintons, both of them, have only done what any white-trash scum would have done if put in their places.</comment>

<comment>??? I am wondering what YOU think is a pervert. You seem to have ruled out all perversions.Oops. I forgot the one absolute perversion. He is not homosexual. I guess he is okay, then.</comment>

<comment>Project much?</comment>

<comment>W. and company lied to get us into a war that has cost us trillions. But we impeached a peacetime President for cheating on his wife. That tells us everything about Republican values. Religion harms.</comment>

<comment>he was impeached for lying - he should have just told the truth - but that does not run it that family - liars all of them.</comment>

<comment>Lying to get into war for the profit of Bush admin allies vs Lying about a blowjobOnly conservatives find those analogous. Stupid is as stupid does.</comment>

<comment>What does the Iraq war have to do with anything? This isn't a debate about the Bush presidency vs. the Clinton presidency. Besides, you can't defend one reprehensible action by saying, "Well, other people did worse."If Bill Cosby is scum for abusing women, you can't change the rules for Bill Clinton or dismiss all his accusers as trailer park trash. Nor can Hillary get away with claiming to stand for female victims of sexual abuse and piously stating that they deserve to be believed. Hypocrisy is as hypocrisy does. </comment>

<comment>Bush and allies made nothing from the war.  Total Democrat BS.  You just make yourself look stupid saying it.</comment>

<comment>Impeached and found not guilty.</comment>

<comment>Impeached and disbarred.</comment>

<comment>Clinton was not disbarred,. He surrendered his license for five years.  HUGE difference.</comment>

<comment>Right, huge.</comment>

<comment>He was impeached for committing perjury.</comment>

<comment>But he did not commit perjury.</comment>

<comment>AKA: the most beloved former president alive in America today according to every poll.</comment>

<comment>There are plenty of trash out there who are totally on board with Clinton's behavior.  What would be the point of being governor of Arkansas, they feel, if you couldn't have state troopers bringing you women for BJ's?</comment>

<comment>This is a democracy and the grown ups who don't see his private marriage as having anything to do with how well he performed as president outnumber you.He did better by the numbers than anyone before him since FDR.   You have no idea what his and Hilary's agreement is concerning their fidelity.  That's because it's none of your business.  He was hired to be president and he presided over peace, prosperity, surplus, and growth. He was successful.</comment>

<comment>He did almost nothing.  He reaped the benefit of Reagan/Bush winning the Cold War and the computer tech revolution.</comment>

<comment>Yea.  Reagan is dead, and beating out Carter wow.  There are a lot of stupid Democrats in this county. That is the problem.</comment>

<comment>I don't totally disagree with you. But I'm also mature enough to not give shit about what her husband may have been guilty of, when I'm evaluating her.  My entire point is - let's look specifically at HRC. And let the chips fall where they may, but not because of whatever Bill may have been guilty of. Let's try and be a little more intelligent than that.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget he associates with pedophiles. </comment>

<comment>How about this?  Bill deregulated the prescription of narcotics and I had to watch the fallout as my high school class got addicted to the prescription pain killers he doctors gave them when they were injured playing sports, and then I have to watch them die as they moved on to heroin.  This was in an affluent white town of 40,000 too.If Bill and Hillary ever get the handcuffs they deserve, I'm cashing in all of my vacation time for a huge party.</comment>

<comment>InfoWars is fun!</comment>

<comment>Don't go to that website, and even if I did this is ad hominem.  If someone from infowars says 2+2=4, is he wrong because he is from infowars?  Completely irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>Seriously dude? Clinton deregulated narcotics? The last I looked, you still needed a script to get pain killers. So your buddies were over prescribed by their doctors and somehow that is Clinton's fault?Geeze, you morons never quit.</comment>

<comment>You're a fool.  Doctors hand out prescription meds like candy now.  Some kid trusts a doctor, takes his medicine, and gets hooked.  I guess it's okay: the pharma made their money and Bill got some of it.  After all, we were all born to serve the liberal elite.</comment>

<comment>Dude, take your meds. Bill Clinton did not de-regulate narcotics. Bill Clinton did not tell any physician to prescribe narcotics. Bill Clinton did not make any person take their narcotic pain medication. Yet, you blamed him because some of your buddies became addicted. Try blaming your friends for not seeking help when they became addicted.People like you are why Obamacare mandates mental health treatment.</comment>

<comment>Not my buddies, but people around me.   Liberals always show how compassionate they really are when forced to choose between reality and their ideology.  This country has a prescription pill epidemic, where pharmaceuticals prey on people who have no idea what the drugs they are being prescribed are with special interest backing hiding their wrong doing. I need no meds, I have a degree in biochemistry and produce more for the world in a day than you do in a month.  You are merely trying to medicalize dissent for the status quo, a fitting role for a liberal, the group that so often falls for worshiping the elite.Obamacare is a paid response to a created crisis by the insurance companies.  They had a law passed that allowed them to regionalize their services in agreement with other companies, which is price fixing and collusion.  Then doctors tried to use themselves as an intermediate in selling insurance to go around this problem, so the insurance companies used the government to make this illegal as well.  Since the price was fixed, they could just keep driving up the cost until a government response was mandated.  Then the government made it a requirement by law to buy the insurance companies' product.  It was a rigged game from the start and you fell for it; the big businesses win. There is a reason the three largest health insurance companies rose 50+ in the stock exchange after the ACA was passed.</comment>

<comment>Take your meds.</comment>

<comment>I always take people resorting to one liners that they repeat as them having no argument.  Glad to see you are at that point.  Slick Willie also allowed commercial and investment banks to combine, allowing them to hold peoples investments and savings hostage and causing the 2008 financial crisis.  But hey, he looks good on TV, so I guess this is alright.</comment>

<comment>How about it? Again - I'm not defending HRC by any means, but these smear tactics of trying to bring her down because of allegations of what her husband did, just smack of desperation. Let's get off this bullshit and look specifically at the candidates themselves - not what their spouses may have done, not what their children did, not what kind of pets the have. All of this is just silly.And, at the end of the day, I'll probably end up agreeing with you that she's a horrible choice for a candidate, but not because of where her husband may have chosen to park his cigar almost 20 years ago. Please...</comment>

<comment>When a candidate dispatches that spouse as a representative of her campaign, then his past behavior becomes a legitimate item for discussion.  Particularly when one of that candidate's favorite talking points is how poorly the oppositions treats women and wages a war against them. Neither Bill or Hillary Clinton have a pristine reputation in that area.</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying that either of them have "pristine reputations." Pointing out the stupidy and logical fallacies of some critics of HRC doesn't necessarily equate to a defense of her - it simply means that if one is going to criticize, at least do it intelligently, relevantly, and with some degree of intellectual rigor, rather than this stupid BS about what her husband may have done.</comment>

<comment>And yet, Bill Clinton is still the most popular living former President. Well, I'll assume that that is among those who can differentiate between what the man did for America and what he may have done in his private life.</comment>

<comment>OK.Hillary lied about Benghazi to the deaths of Americans.Hillary blatantly compromised national security and is trying to avoid prosecution.Hillary has bragged about tampering with evidence when she was a lawyer to get her clients off.Bill's rap sheet is longer, but birds of a feather flock together.</comment>

<comment>Google Cigar Clinton Vagina.  You are a naïve idiot.</comment>

<comment>And why would I do that? Googling such a thing would truly prove one to be a 'naive idiot,' dontcha think?</comment>

<comment>You have more than proved your idiocy.  You are saying Bill is not a pervert.  Well, shoving a cigar up an intern's pussy and then smoking it would qualify.  Smears are lies,  Perversion is bad behavior, and blaming the victim, as HRC did, is just as bad.  And really, other than being married to the pervert President, what has she ever accomplished?</comment>

<comment>I never said any such thing. And you continue to, adeptly or ignorantly, miss my point - what "she has ever accomplished" has nothing to do with Bill's extramarital affairs. And before your next inane response - that statement doesn't automatically equate to a defence of HRC. It merely clarifies that if you are going to ask the question, "what has she ever accomplished" then maybe you should actually focus on the substance of the question, rather then periphal trivia.</comment>

<comment>And the Republicans are going to nominate Trump-  he of multiple bankruptcies and divorces whose ex wife accused him of raping him and says he wants to f@#k his daughter. GREAT foil to what you call a corrupt wife of a pervert. The party of Dennis Hastert and David Vitter should maybe look in the mirror before calling anyone perverts and crooks.</comment>

<comment>It's OK if you do it while wearing diapers.</comment>

<comment>Out of curiosity, why is it worse to cheat on your wife while the President of the United States and then lie about it than to cheat on your wife while a United States Senator and then lie about it?</comment>

<comment>Wow, still? The best you can say against the Clintons is Bill cheated on his wife?Besides, why the anger. The Clintons are basically Republicans, in terms of their policies.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but today's Congressional Republicans are basically Democrats, in terms of their acceptance of the Harry Reid-approved omnibus bills.</comment>

<comment>Republicans hate the Clintons,to say otherwise makes you look stupid.  No not just cheated, serial rapist, pervert.  Want more, Whitewater, Marc Rich, etc etc etc. Just Google Clinton scandals, there are dozens.</comment>

<comment>How far did any of them go? Sure he was impeached, but came out stronger.The funny part is none of the RWNJs will defend Bush II, Bush I or even Reagan. Yet they think Clinton's crap stinks.</comment>

<comment>Did not come out stronger. He accomplished very little.  He was disbarred and disgraced and many of his cronies went to prison.  The fact he is popular with a bunch of ignorant people does not make him a great President.</comment>

<comment>Ya, I didn't think your hatred and low IQ could see that Clinton was the last President to see higher votes for his party in a mid-term election.</comment>

<comment>So the sneaky Bush fooled wise old Hillary.  That's hilarious.</comment>

<comment>Two factors no one seems to consider when predicting elections, but which are very important: the quality of the candidates' voices, and, the question of how much FUN the candidates are likely to have as President.  Bush the Elder lost his reelection bid largely because of his nasal, reedy, irritating voice and because he didn't seem to enjoy being President very much.  Reagan had that silky low bass-baritone voice, and everyone knew he would have loads of fun playing the role of President, so he won twice (three times if you count the election of his VP as a victory for him.).  Clinton had a husky heldentenor voice, and had more fun as President than anyone, so he won twice (three times if you count Gore winning the popular vote as a victory for Bill).  One of the main reasons Trump is winning the Republican primary is he would certainly have more fun as President than any of the other Republican candidates.The vocal question bodes ill for Ted Cruz.  He has the same grating, nasal, prissy, reedy sound as Bush the Elder.  No way will Americans vote to listen to him for four years.Hillary's voice is irritating, but she would obviously have a great deal of fun being President.</comment>

<comment>The time for a positive program was three years ago, at least. It may be too late now.</comment>

<comment>The GOP did such a great job of selling economic malaise and cultural doom to it's base it's a little rich to think they can now sell to the same people that the guy who is running on a platform of reversing the malaise and doom isn't the answer they seek.Isn't that called irony?</comment>

<comment>Spot on. The republicans are now reaping what they have sown. Weeds growing in sh&t. </comment>

<comment>It's also social media.  Our culture has literally revolutionized how we interact with each other in just a few years.  And the change has made our national discourse more course overall, and perceived senses of injustice (whether justified or not) become viral much more easily.The sentiments that Trump is tapping into have always existed.  But it's never been so easy for supporters of those ideas to organize themselves.  It's not like these people are geniuses who are capable of creating an online social network.  They rely on the innovations of the successful people they loathe to spread their message.</comment>

<comment>Idk about that. Social media is faster and more visible (to the rest of us), but other than that it's not new. Back in the day there would be underground newspapers and pamphlet parties and all sorts of ways to organize. </comment>

<comment>Which required a lot more effort, reached a lot fewer people, but weren't as easy to track.</comment>

<comment>The effort thing actually is good news. Before people actually had to grab their pitchforks for a cross burning. Now they just sit in their mother's basement. Other than being loud they're too lazy and cowardly to be a threat.</comment>

<comment>But Trump is a greater threat than the Bundys.  Of course Americans, outside a fringe few, are going to reject lawlessness.  But a lot are willing to support Trump's toxic populism.  I still have faith that it will ultimately be less than half of the voting public in November, but I am not certain.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but my claim is that those means were less effective than social media.  Social media allows you to spread hysteria with a bare minimum of effort on the part of both propagandist and member of the general public.I'm not sure that I'm right, but I do think the effectiveness of different media outlets is relevant.  Pamphlets don't go viral in the way that hyperlinks and tweets do.</comment>

<comment>I've found with social media people just find the few outlets they agree with and never read anything else (unless it comes from one of those outlets secondhand, as in "look what this moron who believes the opposite of what you do said! Isn't he a moron?")And if you think Trump is the first time the working-class followed a charismatic proto-fascist who promised them the world and told them their problems were because of a different ethnic or religious group you haven't read much history.</comment>

<comment>I agree with both points.  It's the combination of Trump's message and the effectiveness of spreading it through social media that is problematic.It's similar in nature (though not morally equivalent, obviously) to success of ISIS.  Jihadism has long existed, but the power of social media has transformed the ability to spread the message more effectively.</comment>

<comment>Frum notes of the Republican base that "Almost 9 in 10 say the country is seriously off on the wrong track, and more than 8 in 10 are dissatisfied with the way the federal government works..." - but how much of that is from the non-stop propaganda of the Republican party telling them so? Republicans have fed their base a steady diet of lies and fear. The reality is that our military is the strongest in the world by far, our diplomatic standing is better than any time since the invasion of Iraq, and the US economy is one of the best performing economies in the West after the great recession. But when all the base hears is that we are weak, collapsing, and the President literally hates and wants to destroy America, the base will turn to a demagogue like Trump.</comment>

<comment>The media is dead set on insulting the voters. Even George Will, someone I admire greatly, has played the "nuclear triad" card.  This term was not even mentioned in Eric Schlosser's massive book on US nuclear weapons policy, Command and Control.  The media takes everyday humor (shooting someone on fifth avenue) and pretends it has never heard of hyperbole before. Think if Colbert had made that same joke, Would anyone not get it as a joke?  Trump is very funny on the stump and people get him quite easily.  People realize the media takes them for fools and they hate it.  Trump is right to skip this last debate.  Megyn Kelly made an unfounded accusation to kick start her career in the first debate. It was not a question.  She is disqualified.</comment>

<comment>You appear to be as thin-skinned as Trump.  If he is afraid of moderately tough questioning from a reporter, how is he going to *win* against Putin (who is already manipulating Trump), Kim Jong Un, etc?</comment>

<comment>Fox was planning an ambush of Trump and stood to make millions of dollars in profits.  Trump has won every debate and is far and away the frontrunner.  I concede this was a bold and risky move, but at this point it is already being hailed as yet another master stroke.  Trump wins every one of these fights with the media.   He is always several steps ahead.  I like Kelly.  I watch her show.  But she made a vicious and unfounded accusation.  Last night even Michael Moore was drooling over her femi-Nazi tactic. She is clearly biased and this is a presidential debate about choosing the leader of the free world.  It should not be about a moderator.  She could easily have recused herself.</comment>

<comment>So your argument boils down to "How dare someone quote Donald Trump's own words to Donald Trump!?!?!  It's a vicious tactic that shouldn't exist in a country with freedom of the press!!!!!"</comment>

<comment>Your argument boils down to this....  (It is not just you, it is the entire media and GOP establishment.): "We have license to lie and attack and destroy the reputation of a candidate, and attack his supporters, and abandon all the accepted norms of journalism.  Our reason for this is based on nothing really, we just do not like him.  He is not one of us.  If the candidate objects, we will call him "thin-skinned" and mount new attacks.  We will turn the tables and claim that by defending himself he is 'insulting his way to the White House'."Trump is expected all along to just take this and go into yet more ambushes and have yet more talking heads to declare him the loser of debates that any objective observer can see he easily won.</comment>

<comment>No lies were told except the ones in this post of yours.  Trump has an incredibly thin skin and authoritarian tendencies.  Give me a break.  If Obama tried to boycott Fox News (instead of granting them the first interview after he won the presidency), you'd be screaming at the top of your lungs.</comment>

<comment>You have no arguments. Only lies.</comment>

<comment>[holds up mirror for Iguana]</comment>

<comment>You come here an attack people and lie.  Nice try.</comment>

<comment>"We have license to lie and attack and destroy the reputation of a candidate, and attack his supporters, and abandon all the accepted norms of journalism.Isn't that how the Republicans have been playing for the past 7 years? How many times have the RWNJs writteen that Obama is a communist (he isn't), or isn't natural born (he is), or Obamacare has "Death Panels" (it doesn't), or Obamacare will "make doctors civil servants" (it doesn't), or Obama is coming to take all yer guns (he isn't).You Right Wing Morons have done nothing but attack Obama and Democrats. Since most of the time you had nothing, you invented crap. When, as in Fast and Furious, the RWNJs complained that  a straw purchase gun killed a Border Patrol agent, they refused to close the loophole.Now you attack Democrats for what you morons have been doing. Get a life.</comment>

<comment>Both questions Kelly has asked him were basically "Here's a quote from you or your twitter account. Do you still stand by them?" Heh. Trump's response to one of them ("You've called women fat pigs") was literally "Only Rosie O'Donnell". But you're right. Nothing about reading his quotes to him is based in reality, and he isn't insulting people. He's just not politically correct. Those terms aren't related in any way. Its really all a conspiracy by the elites to take down your billionaire elite. They're probably outside your house right now trying to come up with ways to take you down too.</comment>

<comment>Voters can judge for themselves.  I think it is quite obvious what is going on.  Being attacked by the media is one big reasons Americans are rallying to Trump.  We are sick of it.  Something has got to change with our snowflake media elite.</comment>

<comment>"This term was not even mentioned in Eric Schlosser's massive book on US nuclear weapons policy, Command and Control"You all keep playing this card, forgetting that the questions was framed to explain what the triad was. Trump failed to realize that, which IS utterly hilarious.</comment>

<comment>Aw, is the big mean media mean to poor little Trumpy wumpy?</comment>

<comment>Well, this advice assumes the GOP is a coherent rational organism, whereas it's a syndicate that's not geared towards success at the top-most level but merely to exist to satisfy the parasitical needs of the infotainment-policy-industrial circus.</comment>

<comment>LOL</comment>

<comment>No, it's incredibly rational and so successful the Democrats basically abandoned all their political beliefs (except abortion and same-sex marriage) back in the 90s. Not many political parties are so successful they can make over the opposition in their own image.</comment>

<comment>Actually, there was. FDR ushered in the New Deal after an abysmal response to the Great Depression (sound familiar Republicans?) and Republicans absolutely fell in line behind him. You may remember Dwight Eisenhower who governed as a centrist Republican. It angered Daddy Koch to the extent that the Birchers called Ike a communist. Then you have Nixon. He was quite the liberal in so many ways including the formation of the EPA. Reagan turned the tide and Clinton had no choice but to govern from the right. That tide is now turning sharply to the left and you Republicans can see the path ahead.</comment>

<comment>1. I think it's hilarious you think anyone who says anything besides "Democrats are super and everything they do is great!" is a Republican.2. Yes, things were different from the 30s to the 60s. But no, don't act like poor little Clinton had no choice but to abandon all his principles just for access to power. Even if that were true, it makes him look horrible. And the tide might be turning to the left (economically) but the Dems aren't taking advantage of it as they abandoned the working class 25 years ago. Now everyone is paying attention to the right-wing (racist, crazy, religious nuts) economic populists. Because when the Democrats became Wall Street bootlickers (in exchange for a respect they never got) what do you expect?And it's way too early to say anything about whether the country is moving leftward. Let me know when someone besides Sanders is proposing real New Deal-esque policies, not just immigrant-bashing and fascism. Because right now, all that's happening is people are comparing Bush and Reagan to Trump sand they come out looking pretty good.</comment>

<comment>Sorry but I had mixed up conversations here. You are right. I should not guessed at your affiliation.Parties just respond to the people when they make loud noises. That has been the case since politics has been around which is a really long time. There was no way that Eisenhower could have been president if he promised a return to the politics of Hoover. Never would have happened. Clinton calculated that he needed to move right to match the mood of the country and he was right. He won two terms on his hunch. That's the way the parties evolve.As to the current shift left....Women in the militaryGays in the militaryWider acceptance of global warmingUniversal health careEnding our involvement in IraqIgnoring the noise to invade another countryNuclear deal with IranChemical agents out of Syria with a warSeems much more moderate if you ask me. Besides, aren't all the thought-leaders on the right telling us how socialist Obama really is? Very confusing, don't you think?</comment>

<comment>-Yes to the first two. -If people really believed in global warming there would be serious efforts to curb emissions and energy usage. Instead, we're using more energy than ever and it's not coming from nuclear or geothermal. -Obamacare was originally designed by the Heritage Foundation and was Bob Dole's preferred healthcare plan in '96. Single-payer (what we SHOULD have) isn't even brought up any more. -We're out of Iraq (sort of) but engaged in multiple wars (or "military actions" or whatever) against plenty of groups. We have no game plan for those, either.Oh, and Obama is terrible on civil liberties (although to be fair, nearly is everyone else).Being a bit to the left of Bush is nowhere near good enough. The left shouldn't be satisfied with the ever-shrinking middle class and the ever-decreasing social mobility just because it doesn't also come with a side of not killing gay people in the street.</comment>

<comment>People in Iowa (and other white Christian conservatives) don't care about Common Core or the location of embassies. These are people who still believe Obama is Muslim and hates America. They are out for blood.  And the easiest pickings are immigrants and Trumps tells them what they want to hear.  Simpletons like simple statements and simple solutions.</comment>

<comment>You represent simpletons quite well with your comment , and the fact that you have no idea you did.</comment>

<comment>I know, facts hurt a-holes like you.Des Moines Register polls:71% of Trump Republicans either do not believe or are not convinced that Obama was born in the United States.69% believe Obama is waging a war on Christianity43% believe Obama is a MuslimYou see, those are the facts.  Deal with it.  The typical Republican today is an uneducated racist xenophobe.Trump feeds off that, throws them a few sharp one-liners, and they lap it up like puppies.</comment>

<comment>100% of J.A. Larson's posts are idiotic</comment>

<comment>you just told someone else that 100% of his posts are idiotic, and then told me to lighten up... does this sound consistent to you?</comment>

<comment>It's not so much that they're unintelligent, rather that they're severely misinformed. They're connected to a steady stream of lies and BS from the far-right media. Even smart people can be taken in by that crap if they get too much exposure to it.</comment>

<comment>excellent point, and one that needs to be made more else we will never get the right and left to cooperate.</comment>

<comment>Southern Strategy in a nutshell: take the legitimate rage and grievances of the people, and turn them against the weak, powerless and disenfranchised. Those Trump Republicans do have very legitimate reasons to be outraged, as their economic security over the last 40 years has fallen precipitously both in absolute terms and (more importantly for these individuals) relative to racial and ethnic minorities. Once upon a time, they may not have been rich, but they could thrive as working-class, and they could also look down their noses at black people who were definitely worse off. Now they're about equal in every way, and it drives them nuts.Obviously, I look at that and find it appalling, even as a person who has barely managed to get into the working class myself. But it is the world that they knew and hope to regain. The writing should have been on the wall when the "free market" explanation for the Great Recession amounted to "Don't blame us! Things were going great until those dumb Democrats started letting those shifty poor blacks buy homes. Oh and by the way, we can totally pencil you black people in as voting Republican, right?"</comment>

<comment>Don't forget the Democrats abandoned the working-class (of every color!) to placate Rush Limbaugh. They caved on everything so the GOP wouldn't call them mean names and look where it got them. Now the right-wing is successful pretending to adopt left-lreaning economic and foreign policies. Meanwhile Obama refused to punish Wall Street AT all, and has killed more Muslims than any President in history and half the country STILL sees him as a member of al Qaeda/a black panther.We wouldn't be in this mess if the Democrats hadn't been useless toads since Johnson.</comment>

<comment>I have no reason not to believe that Obama wasn't born in the US.  What does matter, and is undeniably true, is that he didn't really grow up in the US,  having spent his most formative years outside the US, leading to what I would describe as his "citizen of the world" mentality.I don't believe his a Muslim either, though he does seem to have some sort of strange affinity for it.  I can't necessarily blame people who think he is a Muslim.  He has said some strange things over the years that would fuel that (purposely?).  In the end, it wouldn't even make much difference to me.  Black Liberation Theology is bad enough.As someone who is racist and a "xenophobe," I can assure you that your generalization about Republicans is unfortunately not true.  I spend more time battling NRO cuckservative types than you people these days.</comment>

<comment> What does matter, and is undeniably true, is that he didn't really grow up in the US,  having spent his most formative years outside the US,False. As is the rest of your comment. Obama spent four years living outside the country.I don't believe his a Muslim either, though he does seem to have some sort of strange affinity for it.  I can't necessarily blame people who think he is a Muslim.I can. Obama has never exhibetid more of an affinity for Islam than he has for any religion outside his own. Stoking flames that says he supports Muslims over Christians is part of what is wrong with the RWNJs.As someone who is racist and a "xenophobe," I can assure you that your generalization about Republicans is unfortunately not true.That is typical RWNJ.  Most are racists and xenophobic. You do get creds for admitting it though.</comment>

<comment>Yeah so from age 6 to age 10 he lived in Indonesia.  Those are extremely important years, your first few years of school and becoming a young adult.  Then it was back to Hawaii, which quite frankly is "America" only as a matter of statute."I will stand with the Muslims should the political winds shift in an ugly direction." To his credit, he does seem to be sticking to this, which is why he invokes muh crusades in response to kebabs blowing things up and killing people in the present day.</comment>

<comment>"Most formative years" = ages 6-10. "Muslim affinity" = attended church for years, married in church, both his children were baptised, But look at me, trying to use logic with someone who uses the word "cuckservative".</comment>

<comment>Like I said, Muslim or not, it makes no difference to me.  Burger Americans operate under the premise that his Marxist Black Liberation Church is preferable to being a Muslim.  I don't.</comment>

<comment>Believing Obama is a Marxist is somehow even dumber than believing he's a Muslim. He didn't punish Wall Street, lowered taxes for nearly everyone, the economy grew under his administration and employment went down, he's bailed out businesses and he appointed Janet Yellin to the Fed and had Summers and Geithner as close economic policymakers. And that's when he's not busy publicly insulting Cornell West.</comment>

<comment></comment>

<comment>Don't forget those "simpletons" put Obama in the running. LOL. Nice try.</comment>

<comment>Obama appealed to people's intelligence, not their stupidity.</comment>

<comment>hahjahahahahahahaha OMG that was funny</comment>

<comment>The stupid went for Trump.</comment>

<comment>The people in Iowa voted for Obama, in the 2008 caucus and both Presidential elections and it wasn't close. And their only industry (agriculture) depends very heavily on immigrant labour. All the massive lobbying the farm lobby does on Iowans' behalf is aimed at keeping the sorts of immigration regulations that Trump is now talking about.</comment>

<comment>If getting rid of working class anxieties over immigration was enough to stop Trump, how do you explain the recent election victory of the far-right nationalist party in Poland, which has the fastest growing economy in the EU, has no immigration, and in fact has seen massive emigration as its working class benefits from and takes advantage of open borders? This is just a nationalist moment, driven by media and momentum rather than rational concerns.And the GOP should not embrace protectionism if it wants to be a serious opposition. Nearly all economists agree that free trade is good for the country. FDR, the great hero of the working class, massively cut tariffs during the Great Depression because it was obvious that those tariffs were hurting more than they were helping, including working class members who had to pay higher prices and deal with retaliatory tariffs from abroad. Pandering to protectionists would be like pandering to creationists or climate change deniers--maybe a good strategy in the short run, but as soon as you have to enact policies, they will not work because they are not supported by the science and you will suffer in the long run.</comment>

<comment>Although the majority of economists support free trade - most of those are beholden to the corporate establishment, and thus biased.Here is economist Ian Fletcher who strongly disagrees:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...By the way - establishment economists typically argue about what is good for the nation as a whole- but they choose not to point out that disproportionate benefit for the elite combined with the bad effect for the middle class.</comment>

<comment>Spud!! you are linking to Huffpo??? (shudders)j/k</comment>

<comment>Get with reality. Trump and Sanders share some of the same philosophy.Protecting the little guy against the crony capitalists.I support the free market.  The Chinese and similar countries do not give a KRAPPE about the free market and a level playing field.We cannot have free trade if our product prices are disadvantaged by worker safety, enviornmental protection and a million other good things about America.We need tariffs back the way they were in the good old days.Free trade has encouraged offshoring of jobs.</comment>

<comment>I am all for taking on China and its Trade policies. They need us more than we need them . They know it and Trump knows it. Obama and Hillary? Not so much.</comment>

<comment>There is more to it than just that. If a US company is overshoring jobs to China, they need to have massive tariffs slapped on their products.</comment>

<comment>And when the millions of poor people who shop at WalMart suddenly have a 50% increase in everything they buy... you'll see how fast they would want their products manufactured in China.</comment>

<comment>Millions of poor people are already seeing price increases at Walmart due to leftists forcing Walmart to raise wages.  Not to mention the millions of poor that will not have a Walmart to shop at at all because those same higher wages are forcing Walmart to close over 150 stores.</comment>

<comment>Most of the store closings are in the south. And there is no minimum wage increase there...Maybe, just maybe, WalMart overexpanded with SuperCenters, Sams Clubs, Neighborhood stores, etc.</comment>

<comment>I thought Republicans believe in an unfettered marketplace and free enterprise — which would presumably mean that when Walmarts close other businesses will open to fill the void.Also, aren't Republicans supposed to support small business? You're constantly spouting its virtues, but when push comes to shove you prefer billion dollar mega-corporations?</comment>

<comment>Don't  put words in my mouth.  Yes, if there is a need others will fill the void.  Until that void is filled though, these poor that JA refers to will be out of luck.  And I'm not anti-walmart.  They have added thousands of jobs to local economies and millions if not billions to the tax roll.</comment>

<comment>Your average WalMart employee gets food stamps, housing assistance and other low income government benefits. WalMart's low wages are subsidized by tax dollars.Now, if we count that as subsidizing WalMart or not, the undeniable fact is that, without those subsidies, WalMarts wages would have to rise - no one can afford to live on that level, unless the US is willing to accept third world level poverty as a price we pay for "Low Low Prices".On the other hand, the Walton's wealth has been increasing in 'yuge' numbers . They continue to make more every year than they did before. Waltons wages go up, WalMart Employee wages stay flat (which is a decrease if you factor in inflation)This is literally what Trump voters are angry about, isn't it? Flat wages?</comment>

<comment>And what do you think the $15 minimum wage is going to do to poor people ?</comment>

<comment>Why don't you make a list for me where the minimum wage is $15/hr</comment>

<comment>Typical cliche corporate propaganda.People with better jobs can pay slightly higher prices.</comment>

<comment>And you are in some fairyland where you believe corporations don't pay as little as possible to increase margin as much as possible.  Corporations would run over their mother in the road to gain 1/2% on the bottom line.</comment>

<comment>WTF? As if I did not know that. You seem to be replying to the wrong post.</comment>

<comment>Not exactly. If the clothing factories came back to America, then many of those Walmart shoppers would have jobs. If the plastic storage containers were made here, then a town would have an open factory. And so much more.I still buy the cars my neighbor makes.</comment>

<comment>Glad you had a moment to post before heading over to Wal-mart to fill your basket with another load of Chinese made crap.</comment>

<comment>Actually I only buy groceries at Wal Mart. ;)</comment>

<comment>I think you got me there.</comment>

<comment>Free market doesn't mean a level playing field. It means prices are set by supply and demand. The problems you point out are flaws in the free market theory, which is why it's bunk. No economy will ever exist in a magical free market vacuum which doesn't have additional forces outside the market acting on it.</comment>

<comment>"...Free market doesn't mean a level playing field. It means prices are set by supply and demand...".No, acually it means BOTH those things. We are merely arguing about word definitions.</comment>

<comment>We're not. The free market is completely amoral. It doesn't care who wins or loses. You seem to think supply and demand are fair or guarantee a level playing field. They don't. Supply and demand aren't fair. Nor do they stop economies in one region with some competitive advantage  (whether it's a particular city, state or corporation, or a particular country) from outcompeting another. A true free market doesn't care whether everyone in one region is unemployed due to a shift in demand to products produced elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>You completely misunderstood my post - your reply has nothing to do with what I posted.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, the bit I was responding to was this:"I support the free market. The Chinese and similar countries do not give a KRAPPE about the free market and a level playing field.We cannot have free trade if our product prices are disadvantaged by worker safety, enviornmental protection and a million other good things about America.We need tariffs back the way they were in the good old days."It's hard to tell if you're being sarcastic about tariffs, but for the rest of it you seem to be saying that it's not fair that the US has constraints, worker protections etc that China doesn't, and that if we all played by the same rules the free market would somehow mean the US had an opportunity to compete. That's not necessarily true.</comment>

<comment>How could you deny something like that? Denying the obvious is just being absurd and silly.</comment>

<comment>The issue I have is that it seems like you're arguing for some imaginary ideal of free market capitalism that doesn't exist, and never has. There are always social and political constraints on economic systems, whether it's regulation or religion or whatever. I agree there's a disparity in regulations, but even if you took those away the Chinese should still in theory outcompete us in sectors like manufacturing because they have such a massive workforce, and competition for jobs would drive wages down to near zero in ways that just won't happen in the US. Your argument for competition within the manufacturing sector at least seems to be "If only social conditions in the US were as bad as China, we could compete!" That seems like an absurd and silly argument, even if it's correct, it's meaningless.</comment>

<comment>"...even if you took those away the Chinese should still in theory outcompete us in sectors like manufacturing because they have such a massive workforce...".That is not logical.  By your logic, all manufacturing should only take place in countries with large populations.In reality, there is absolutely no reason that a country with a smaller population cannot out-compete a larger one - given a level playing field of regulations and infrastructure - by choosing to specialize in certain industries."...Your argument for competition within the manufacturing sector at least seems to be "If only social conditions in the US were as bad as China, we could compete!"...".There is some truth to that.  ONE way to compete would be to lower our social conditions and have an authoritarian government.  The OTHER way to compete is MY preference : protectionism.</comment>

<comment>We may actually agree on something here, I'm generally in favor of protectionism as well. :)</comment>

<comment>Trump and Sanders do not share anything in common, except, that both put their shoes on one at a time. Trump sees people as a cash source and Sanders sees them as people.</comment>

<comment>you wish.</comment>

<comment>Plus, "free" trade is not really "free."  It depends on a secure global environment where property rights are respected.  It is why we spend 600B annually to "defend" a country that is separated from the rest of the world by large oceans.  The economists are still probably right that this is a net win, but it is a gross economic distortion for the US domestic economy to shoulder the tax burden that enables it.  A truly free market would fund our overseas military commitments with import/export duties.  Surely, assets that exist within our national borders are much cheaper to protect.</comment>

<comment>Tariffs are bad. But so is offshoring your manufacturing sector. I don't know how to fix this. But I'm equally suspicious of the fat cat capitalists and the conservatives walking around with their magical solutions like, bring back the Gold Standard and End the Fed.</comment>

<comment>Tariffs are not "bad". They protect native industries against predatory practices of foreign governments who are trying to destroy them.Tariffs were very common during America's greatest period of prosperity.</comment>

<comment>What about the tariff wars which helped along the great depression?</comment>

<comment>Nope. Tariffs did not cause the depression.</comment>

<comment>How do you define a generic phrase such as "Greatest Period of Prosperity"?</comment>

<comment>Roughly the period from WWII until free trade and Wall Street started taking power.</comment>

<comment>You do not understand that you undercut the benefits of a first world society like the USA ( worker protections, environmental protections, etc.) when you force products produced under these expensive protections to compete with foreign products produced WITHOUT those protections.It is like having  one team on steroids playing another team without.</comment>

<comment>You clearly do not get my last few posts at all.</comment>

<comment>Also during the Depression.</comment>

<comment>We haven't offshored our manufacturing sector. We have fewer manufacturing jobs than we used to, but much more manufacturing output: http://mercatus.org/publicatio.... That means job losses are happening because we are getting more efficient, not because we aren't making as much stuff.I'm not sure how many fat cat capitalists support bringing back the gold standard and ending the fed. That seems to be a Ron Paul-type fringe view without much mainstream Republican support.</comment>

<comment>There's an article this week in Bloomberg.com about economists now re-thinking their lock-step support for free trade.</comment>

<comment>The absolute best representation of the GOP, it's values and it's voters is in fact Donald Trump. What he's done with his life, how he treats people, and how he expects people to treat him is the aspiration of pretty much every Republican here. They don't just want to elect Trump, they want to be Trump. They want his power, his wealth, and his inability to he harmed by literally anything he says.</comment>

<comment>Just your private fantasy. In reality, we like Trump's policies. Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Well, OK, perhaps I'm wrong, and you're content with what you have, and don't think that Trump, by virtue of wealth, is basically a better, more "alpha"person than you, worthy of more respect, and that you wish you could get away with being less "PC" in your life.I mean, you like having to think about what you say, while Trump does not, right? You like not having a billion dollars? You don't basically think he's got a better life than you?OK, so I was wrong. Basically, you love Trump's policies. What I love here is that he's basically got people like you literally tearing down the entirety of the Republican party that does not bow down to him, as well as Republican boosters like FOX news. You're basically making the entire Republican party into the Trump party. That's great. I love it. Keep going. Trump harder!</comment>

<comment>Alphas are overrated.</comment>

<comment>Here, let me offer the Trumpista/Gamergater/MRA response: That's just what a beta cuck would say!</comment>

<comment>It's interesting how many progressives seem to fantasize about having only one powerful party - "destroying" the other party.No wonder they liked Stalin so much in the 1930s.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I think a pro-capitalist party is a useful counterbalance to the liberal pro socialist leanings, and that a system full of actual "honorable adversaries" would be a great thing for the US.But at the same time, I am greatly enjoying watching the Frankenstein's monster that is Trump literally take over the GOP.You do realize that's what's happening, right? There's no room for a GOP in which Trump is as popular as he is, and anyone else who questions him.  He's literally incapable of taking criticism without going all out and destroying anyone who questions him.</comment>

<comment>When is the last time Barack Obama EVER admitted to making a mistake?</comment>

<comment>Don't get out much do you?This is the top hit of 'mistakes Obama has admitted to'https://www.washingtonpost.com...So, at least in Nov '15.  Not recent enough for you?</comment>

<comment>ROFLMAO!"You can’t separate good policy from the need to bring the American people along and make sure that they know why you’re doing what you’re doing...".Yup, Obama has done this "admission of error" shtick dozens of times."I came up with this great policy - but the American people are too dumb to understand  why it really benefits them.  I cannot seem to explain it well enough- I am too intellectual to descend to their low level and make them get it".</comment>

<comment>I'm curious, what does that have to do with what I'm talking about? I say Trump is taking over the GOP, or at least trying to, and that he's not just failing to admit he's made a mistake, he's trying to internally crush, in a very loud, very public way, anyone who criticizes him from the right wing.BTW this includes FOX news, which he's actually turning more Republicans against than has ever happened before. The WSJ seems to be on his side, and the National Review is trying and failing badly to take him down.I'm talking about a literal Republican civil war type event. It's interesting if nothing else.  And all you can respond with is "When is the last time Barack Obama EVER admitted to making a mistake?"Aren't you at least interested in what's going on in the GOP?</comment>

<comment>Spuddie erects wobbly strawmen whenever he is incapable of answering a question.</comment>

<comment>I am paying just as much attention as you are.   You tried to nail Trump for some alleged fault which your own progressive leader has demonstrated in spades.</comment>

<comment>Which alleged fault? I said he strongly attacks anyone who dares to disagree with him.He actually admits that himself. He sees it as a virtue, not a flaw. If you go after Trump, Trump goes after you twice as hard, and tries to ruin you. He talks about people who disagree with him or oppose him in simple, belittling language, basically insulting them in simple terms in front of an audience, daring them to do it again, because he'll hit back twice as hard.And he's dividing the GOP. That's not even necessarily him. It's the GOP attacking him more than they attack Hillary.These are not flaws I'm pointing out in Trump. At least not the way he expresses it. If you've got a problem, you've got a problem with Trump, not me. He's the one who says these things are part of what makes him great.</comment>

<comment>Whatever.</comment>

<comment>Whatever to what? That Trump is trying to remake the GOP? I mean, do you not agree? Agree? Not care at all? I can't tell what you're saying.And remember this is for posterity, so be honest.</comment>

<comment>Fine, maybe he wants to remake the GOP. In any event - the GOP is getting a major kick in the azz that they didn't want to get.</comment>

<comment>Obama's constantly says he deserves blame for things. Did you even google "Obama admits mistake" before writing this?</comment>

<comment>No need to- I am already informed on this topic. But go ahead, find me an admission of error by Obama that does not involve "admitting" that he failed to more vigorously promote his superior understanding to the brain-dead public.He reminds me of a job candidate who is asked his weakness and replies "I am too accurate in making sure that my work is always perfect".</comment>

<comment>Who is the "we" you speak of when speaking about Trumps "policies"? Who are these Stalinist progressives you point to? If anyone's living a fantasy, it's you, little one.</comment>

<comment>You don't know the history, buddy. Educate yourself first - and then come back and post.</comment>

<comment>Ok, lil bud.</comment>

<comment>I don't find that common at all. The most common sentiment I hear from progressives is like this:http://kfmonkey.blogspot.com/2...Except with less concern about tyranny and more about anarchy than during the Bush years.</comment>

<comment>Phony concern trolling, crocodile tears. When Nixon was President - you had a guy who was actually more liberal than Bill Clinton- yet progressives, tried to paint him as the Devil - even before Watergate,</comment>

<comment>Nixon is underrated! His environmental reform and diplomacy were top-notch. (And while I disagree with his use of price controls, certainly many liberals would support price controls).However, he was a wildly paranoid racist criminal who permanently damaged America's social trust. I see him as a tragic figure rather than an all-out villain, but do understand why most progressives hate him.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget that Nixon signed OSHA into existence and had a top marginal income tax rate of 70% and top marginal long-term capital gains tax rate of 35%.</comment>

<comment>Noam Chomsky called Nixon - America's last liberal President:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...Yet progressives still reflexively demonize him. Therefore I take your blog post about 'Where have the good old Republicans gone to?" with a massive grain of salt.</comment>

<comment>I'd say most progressives look back fondly on Nixon, and wish any mainstream Democrat had his policies instead of those of the more right-wing Clinton or Obama.It's relative. Just as Bush looks pretty good with Trump on the table, someone like Nixon, who would be considered a left-wing Sanders-like pipe dream if he ran for office today. But it's more about the era he was from and what policies were mainstream rather than the man himself (who, like you said, was a paranoid racist criminal).</comment>

<comment>So you support abortion and universal health care?</comment>

<comment>The presidency has nothing to do with abortion. I don't have the time to deal with universal health care right now - too complicated.</comment>

<comment>LOL!! There's nothing complicated about it. Trump supports universal health care and the right to abortion. You stated you support his policies. So do you, or don't you?</comment>

<comment>As it happens, I do support the right to abortion. Universal health care is very complicated - and I am not sure.</comment>

<comment>"I am not sure."See... you don't support Trump's policies, merely the persona he pushes in public.</comment>

<comment>You are about as superficial a "thinker" as exists on this board.</comment>

<comment>Lol, says the guy who supports a man and doesn't even know their positions. You had no idea he advocated for universal healthcare. Bet you don't know about his "wealth tax" idea either. He also supported the auto industry bail out, stating the US govt. "can take over companies, and, frankly, take big chunks of companies," affirmative action, and has also consistently championed eminent domain (well at least when it favored his interests he did). For God's sake until recently he advocated for increased immigration!In short, you're a fool.</comment>

<comment>I know enough about his positions to be comfortable with my choice. I don't care about his position on abortion or Universal health care.Trump on affirmative action "I don't think we need it so much anymore."So you don't really know as much as you claim to. Who's the fool, fool?</comment>

<comment>Lol that's his position today, despite supporting AA for over two decades... LMAO!! You truly believe what trump says, don't you? My god you are dumb</comment>

<comment>I find that people like you who use "lol" and "lmao" in the same sentence are usually among the lowest of the low-intelligence posters.</comment>

<comment>I find people that who can't distinguish between one and two sentences are usually among the lowest of the low-intelligence posters. LOL, LMAO!!</comment>

<comment>Trump speaking to "DREAM" immigration advocates in 2013 (this is less than 2 years ago):"You know, the truth is I have a lot of illegals working for me in Miami. You know in Miami, my golf course is tended by all these Hispanics — if it wasn’t for them my lawn wouldn’t be the lawn it is; it’s the best lawn."Trump said he knew the work of undocumented people is what makes his golf courses and hotels great.“At the end of the day, what we’re looking at is a value proposition for America,” Tijerino said to Trump at the end of the meeting, referring to immigration legislation.“You’ve convinced me,” Trump said to the delight of the activists in the room.</comment>

<comment>Lol, it's the best lawn.</comment>

<comment>You know what's funny, is if Trump dropped the right wing and racist rhetoric and stood by what he used to he'd get a good bit of support from minorities and soft democrats. He supported single payer, affirmative action, and wants to enact a large tax on the wealthy. This would of course require him to be consistent about anything so... Never mind I'm dreaming I guess lol</comment>

<comment>Trump will say anything that makes him sound good. He's feeding his ego not his ideology. </comment>

<comment>Slight correction, Trump will say anything that brings him attention. I don't think he cares about looking "good" per se lol.</comment>

<comment>Trump supported Abortion and universal health care in 2000, maybe spud is just behind the times?</comment>

<comment>Which policies?The banning of all Muslims from entering the USA?The border wall?The house to house search and seizure of illegal immigrants?The reintroduction of waterboarding?I will say, I appreciate Trump's support for our veterans, including his apparent willingness to scale back foreign interventions and offensive deployments. He also seems to have the right ideas on campaign finance and policing. But his fortress America mentality is shocking in its lack of attachment to any sort of reality. He doesn't fully understand the consequences that would result on the ground from attempting to implement certain policy proposals, notably the above mentioned.</comment>

<comment>Everyone wants power and wealth and invincibility. At least sometimes. That's human nature. Not limited to Republicans.</comment>

<comment>And the devil, taking him up into an high mountain, shewed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.And the devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.If thou therefore wilt worship me, all shall be thine.</comment>

<comment>What's your point?</comment>

<comment>That yes, we all want power and wealth. But our greatest icons talk about rejecting it for love and compassion.</comment>

<comment>Again with the broad strokes.  I don't want power or wealth.  I want hope, health and happiness.</comment>

<comment>Trump has those on sale too I'm sure, but that's really not why people look up to him.</comment>

<comment>That story is made up.</comment>

<comment>That is a minority opinion</comment>

<comment>So is evolution.¯\_(ツ)_/¯</comment>

<comment>There is a case to be made that a lot of the improvements to society flowed from a growing willingness to prioritize one another's needs.  I believe there is a biological imperative to follow strong leaders that flows from ten thousand years of living in small tribes.  I also believe there is a biological imperative to racism, allowing us to better kill the tribe next door and take their hunting grounds.Most of the last two hundred years has been about learning to overcome this wiring.  It is certainly possible there is a higher force guiding our development, sending us messengers to steer us down the right paths.  But what isn't really debatable is that we are a much more compassionate race than we were when our nation was founded, women weren't allowed to vote, and slave-owners were granted 3/5ths of a vote for every slave they had.</comment>

<comment>Then the Devil jumped up on a hickory stump and said boy lemme tell you what.I guess you didn't know it but I'm a fiddle player too...</comment>

<comment>I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soulI think I'm better than you</comment>

<comment>Everybody wants security.  Beyond that, you might be surprised to find there are huge swaths of people that don't structure their life with the goal of having the biggest pile of shiny crap at the end.  The idea of standing astride a hill of other people who are subservient also has little attraction.  You can blame people's basic nature or even Jesus' teachings.  Right next door is an article about Ted Cruz that reinforces a coarse point that what floats to the top isn't necessarily cream.The wealthiest people aren't necessarily the smartest or most able, they are simply the ones that really liked the trappings of wealth.  Certainly many of them may be intelligent, but they aren't necessarily the smartest.  They just happened to the smartest in their field.</comment>

<comment>That's a pretty broad stroke your painting there son.</comment>

<comment>Not a bit. You'll watch over time where the GOP electorate leans more and more towards Trump, because he's saying what they all want to say themselves. He's the embodiment of what literally every GOP spokesperson has said is the American Dream.The GOP has been told stories for decades about what they should aspire to. And Trump is that final pinnacle of what a Republican success story looks like.  According to himself, he's self made, he always wins in "deals" he has beautiful women whenever he wants, he can say non-PC things and no one can stop him or censure him.How is that NOT what the GOP has been pointing to as what any American should want?</comment>

<comment>Not EVERY conservative, or registered republican, this the same.  Just like not all Democrats are socialists.</comment>

<comment>Looks like it's enough of them to get him the nomination. But point taken. You might be one of the "honorable adversary" types who's just there for lower taxes, less regulation and so on. Like Bloomberg. God I wish the GOP could just pivot and nominate him.</comment>

<comment>I'll give you a thumbs up for disagreeing agreeably.  Peace JJ</comment>

<comment>Peace to you too. May you have health and happiness, but I fond that hope is something we make ourselves as much as is given to us.I hope you'll excuse me for enjoying the Trumpocalypse's effects on the GOP/FOX news.  Feel free to point and laugh at similar horrible Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Why do I have the feeling come November IF Trump wins instead of admitting you were wrong you will be on here saying that the voters were more stupid than even YOU thought they were?</comment>

<comment>I expect him to win the GOP nomination, or be the second runner up. Based on current reliable metrics, I expect Hillary to beat the GOP candidate.If Trump wins a general election, it will be because Hillary did something so remarkably stupid we'd deserve Trump.I don't know that Trump voters are stupid. They are, by the numbers, less educated, less well off, and more white.None of that translates to stupid. I think they're incredibly angry, and were expecting someone like Cruz to do some sort of legislative jujitsu that would make Obama lose. I think that's at least part of the anger, coupled with flat wages, and an economic recovery that didn't really help them much. I think they buy what Trump is selling: that he's such an amazing dealmaker that he'll be able to get a better deal *for them*.What they really are is like poor people buying a lot of powerball tickets. I don't think those people are stupid either. Just out of hope and willing to take a very long gamble.It's sad because there really are good ideas in the Republican party about things like government regulation, and a bipartisan group working on them could unlock a lot of potential in our economy.</comment>

<comment>Bloomberg is more of a Democrat than a Republican.</comment>

<comment>In NYC, he's a Republican.</comment>

<comment>True, the generalization does not literally apply to everyone and there are other issues involved, particularly the stagnation of wages that has inevitably occurred due to globalization.But at the same time, Josh's point has a broad level of truth to it as well.  Trump is like the Powerball -- he appeals to people's desire to get everything they want, even if the actual result of getting what you want would not be as good as you think it would.  Greed and lust for power are parts of human nature.  While Trump courts people who exhibit these traits in excess and engages in rhetoric that heightens people's susceptibility to these traits, I think they exist in almost all of us, regardless of political views.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is running for the people huh?</comment>

<comment>Nope. That's more Sanders. Hillary is a neo-liberal much like Obama and Bill Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Way to throw Obama and Bill under the bus! Nothing can stop this body count!</comment>

<comment>Oh, right, Obama is a socialist kenyan muslim, and Bill was a philandering crook who killed Vince Foster. Better?</comment>

<comment>The left is running scared of Trump.  He may dethrone Hildabeast in Nov election.</comment>

<comment>"You take the lies out of him, and he'll shrink to the size of your hat; you take the malice out of him, and he'll disappear."~~~Mark Twain</comment>

<comment>"Oh Sh**! They're using Twain!  We're dead for sure!"</comment>

<comment>That was FDR, right?</comment>

<comment>What you fail to realize (in your bubble) is that all the metrics point to Trump getting brutally slaughtered in the general.  Every time HRC thinks of him as her opponent, she gets a little giddy.  He's popular in a majority of R primary voters.  That's about 12% to 15% of the actual population.  However, in most elections, about 40% of the voters sit them out.  If even 5% of those voters were horrified enough by Trump to vote, that would be Game Over.  His negatives are stratospheric.  There are people that like him, but the people that don't like him LOATHE him.  Hispanics, who are tepid in their turnout, would walk ten miles to vote against him.  That's a LOT of votes right there.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but remember how sure people were that Romney would trounce Obama?</comment>

<comment>All the way down to the wire. Oh, I remember.</comment>

<comment>You mean after the first debate?  I will always wonder if he was genuinely that bad, or if he threw the first debate to keep the race close.  By doing that, he kept money in the presidential race and out of a myriad other races.  He protected his team.  I'd have to go back and loot at Nate Silver's predictions, since I can almost guarantee that's what Obama did.  Or were you referring to Karl Rove's (rather hilarious) 'certainty'?</comment>

<comment>Trump is only down 2 points nationally to Clinton. Trump is also looking at an electoral map that has white rust belt states going red.Also Hispanics. Are Hispanics Americans first or Hispanics first? I think we know the answer to that one. They have more solidarity with their old countries than their new ones.</comment>

<comment>Nope. What's going on is that the Hispanic Americans are looking at the conservatives posting about how the 'real' number of illegals in the USA is 30/35/40/45 million, and they're scared that if Trump gets elected, makes policy based on the 'real' numbers but can only find 10/11/12 million, he's going to make up the difference by going after the citizens.Hispanics aren't doing this for Latino pride, they're terrified of a government pogrom.</comment>

<comment>"Make America hate again"-Donald Trump </comment>

<comment>You seem the guy pedaling hate on here fibber.</comment>

<comment>Or you could break the jar.</comment>

<comment>That's what America is doing. F*ck that jar.</comment>

<comment>A vote for Trump is a protest vote.  Full stop.  Trump is not some maniac, and he's certainly not Hitler. He's a rational person who has years of executive experience and actually listens to the people he is supposed to represent.  If he is able to manipulate policy as easily as he has manipulated the media up to this point, I think he could be a decent president.  Let's not sit here and pretend that Obama was some super-wonk with tons of experience when he took office.  Trump may not be the best choice, but I would vote for him 1000 times before I would ever vote for Jeb! or Hillary or that weasel Cruz.</comment>

<comment>You totally contradict yourself.  Trump has ZERO experience in running a governmental program.  ZERO.  He is nothing more than a 21st century PT Barnum.  He presents no viable solutions.  None.Rational?  Are you f-ing kidding me?Executive experience means nothing.   Government is not a business.</comment>

<comment>I never said he had experience running a governmental program... Where is this contradiction?</comment>

<comment>ZERO experience is what we've had for 7 years, a street thug "organizer" who never had a real job.</comment>

<comment>"Street thug?"Seriously?!</comment>

<comment>Hand picked by Richie Daley  and his buddy Bill the Bomber.</comment>

<comment>Someone who hangs out on the streets of Chiraq, smoking weed. I'd say that qualifies.</comment>

<comment>Law professor, US Senator.  I'm sure you have a better and more lucrative employment record, oh dog-whistling anonymous internet commenter.</comment>
