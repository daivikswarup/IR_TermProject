<comment>Well, sure - what's bad for the GOP is often good for the Democrats. But in this case, the Republicans have nobody to blame but themselves. This is a simple choice, and it should not be in question at all: a part of a Senator's job is to consider people for new Supreme Court appointments. Republican senators don't have to confirm anyone *quickly*, nor, indeed, at all, if they dislike all the appointments on offer from the President. But they do have to at least address the duty of reviewing those appointments; at least entertain the possibility that someone might make it through. Their foot-dragging on this matter only makes them look bad, and if Democrats pounce on it, that's only to be expected - it's not often that a political party dumps a free PR disaster into the lap of its opposition.</comment>

<comment>WHAT OF O'S SCHUMER'S AND BIDEN'S PAST STATEMENT OF NOT? HOW DOES THE DEMS GET AWAY WITH THIS HYPOCRISY AND THE REPUBS NOT?</comment>

<comment>Just because two Dems have an opinion doesn't mean the rest do. Do you believe in contradicting views in Republicandum? There's a squirrel in your yard, better yell at it, gramps.</comment>

<comment>NO JUST POINTING OUT HOW THE DEMS GET AWAY WITH THEIR HYPOCRISY---JUST AS THE NUKE OPTION --WHEN THE REPUBS WERE TO USE ALL HELL FROM THE DEMS TO STOP YET THEY AS USUAL WERE THE ONES DOING IT---NOT A BIT AGENDA DRIVEN ARE YOU?</comment>

<comment>Just like the Republicans did. You screaming about hypocrisy while ignoring your own is hypocrisy.> NOT A BIT AGENDA DRIVEN ARE YOU?Not even half as you. Try a mirror sometime.</comment>

<comment>I DID NOT START THIS HYPOCRISY NICE BUT CRAP TRY AT DEFLECTING---IT HAS BEEN YOURS LYING ABOUT ALL WHILE HYPOCRITING THEMSELVES---</comment>

<comment>Actually, what they missed is the rest of Biden's speech.http://thinkprogress.org/justi...https://youtu.be/P1erqNm9nHc</comment>

<comment>What goes around, comes around, Dude.</comment>

<comment>AGREEING WITH ME?</comment>

<comment>GUESS YOU DID NOT SEE IT WAS 3 OF THE DEM LEADERS--NOT THE ONLY ONES SAYING THIS--NOTE HOW 2 ARE THE CURRENT PRES AND V PRES--</comment>

<comment>Ohhh, 3 instead of 2! And filibustering something is different than not considering them at all. You morons do love your equivocation.</comment>

<comment>THOSE LEADERS SAID NOTHING OF WHAT YOU MENTIONED WHEN MAKING THE COMMENTS STILL STUPID MUCH?</comment>

<comment>Clearly each side takes advantage of the other's gaffes, but right now, it's the Republicans who are in the hot seat.</comment>

<comment>HOW SO? SINCE THE CONSTITUTION DOES NOT SAY THEY HAVE TO EVEN DISCUSS THE PICK MUCH LESS AFFIRM IT? THEY CAN DELAY AS LONG AS THEY WANT---BUT WERE STUPID TO SHOW THEIR HAND --MITCH FOR PR REASONS CRAPPED ON ANY DELIBERATIONS DONE ---BUT IT IS TELLING HOW THE DEMS WANTED NOT TO CONSIDER BUSH'S [ EITHER ONE ] MORE THAN A YEAR OUT BEFORE THE NEW PRES WAS TO TAKE OFFICE---</comment>

<comment>A statement made by a single senator in 1992 (1992!) does not, in fact, constitute a "Rule," no matter how much the GOP would like to call it so.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans misquoted Biden. They are using the first couple of sentences and ignored the rest. Biden was arguing for moderate, qualified candidates. http://thinkprogress.org/justi...</comment>

<comment>You're absolutely right.  I just figure the low-hanging fruit is pointing out that it wouldn't matter if Biden Hulked out on the Senate floor while bellowing "Biden SMASH NOMINEE!"  He was one senator, talking in a year that didn't even see a vacancy (more than 20 years ago now).  The idea that anything he said or did then would constitute a "Rule" is just laughable on its face.</comment>

<comment>I believe Biden was chair of the Senate Justice committee when he made that speech. BUT, it remains that he was misquoted.It makes so little sense that the Republicans would quote Biden out of context when the whole speech as well as the transcript is readily available. They should have known they would be outed.</comment>

<comment>WHAT KIND OF STUPID ARE YOU? NOT JUST ONE BUT BOTH THE PRES O AND VP BIDEN AMONG OTHER SAID THE SAME--WHO SAID ANY OF IT WAS A RULE? NOT ANY I POSTED ---TYPICAL PROGRESSIVE LYING ABOUT THINGS TO "WIN" THE ARGUMENT NO MATTER THE COST!! YOUR POST ILLUSTRATES HOW CORRUPT YOURS ARE --</comment>

<comment>Oh my.</comment>

<comment>YOUR POINT?</comment>

<comment>Where are you posting these missives from and what language translator are you using? You are coming across as a bit "barefoot in the head". Perhaps dropping the caps and paying better attention to grammar would make you look less like a right wing space cadet.</comment>

<comment>PEOPLE DO NOT THINK NOR TALK IN COMPLETE SENTENCES ----REALLY LIKE HOW ON POINT YOUR ARE ABOUT ALL THE WRONG THINGS AND NOTHING ON TOPIC---STUPID MUCH? OR JUST A WANNA BE BARNEY FIFE OF THE NET--YOU KNOW ANDY'S IMPOTENT DEPUTY WITH THE 1 BULLET HE WAS NEVER ALLOWED TO LOAD IN HIS GUN---IN OTHER WORDS A F'ING JOKE!</comment>

<comment>Actions speak louder than words, I've heard.  Have the Democrats ever refused to hear and vote on a candidate for any reason, much less the specious excuse that it's the president's last year in office?</comment>

<comment>YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW? SINCE ITS BEEN ALL OVER THE NET--GUESS YOU JUST READ ONLY THAT WHICH COMPORTS WITH YOUR IDEAS--BUT LET ME TRY AND REMOVE SOME OF YOUR IGNORANCE---TO START WITH IN 1992 I THINK IT WAS BIDEN THAT SAID THAT A YEAR AND 1/2 OUT FROM GHWB'S TERM ENDING THE SAME DAMN THING--AS DID O IN 2006 I THINK AS WELL AS SCHUMER---SO GET OFF THE SELF RIGHTEOUS HORSE YOU RIDING AND STOP BEING A HYPOCRITE---ON A SIDE BAR 2 OTHER POINTS OF NOTE---THE DEMS HAVE PROCLAIMED THEMSELVES THE PARTY OF THE LITTLE GUY WHILE TAGGING THE REPUBS AS THE PARTY OF THE RICH----HAD ANY BOTHERED TO CHECK THEY WOULD HAVE FOUND THE DEMS HAVE BEEN THE PARTY OF THE RICH FOR DECADES--NOW ON TO ANOTHER ISSUE-THAT OF SOC SEC AND MEDICARE WHICH FOREVER THE DEMS HAVE SAID IT WAS THE REPUBS WANTING TO GET RID OF THEM--YET THE REPUBS HAVE CONSISTENTLY FUNDED IT AS BEST THEY COULD---FOR PROOF OF THE DEMS LYING ON THE ISSUE JUST LOOK TO THE FICA REDUCTION OF 2009- A DEM BILL THAT TOOK MONEY FROM BOTH PROGRAMS--THE CUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TO THE INCOME SIDE OF THE PAY ----FOLLOW THAT WITH THE DEMS STEALING OF THEN $515 NOW $878 BILLION FROM MEDICARE TO MAKE O CARE LOOK FISCALLY SOUND--ADD MORE GAS TO THE FIRE --IT WAS THE DEMS SAYING WE "THE VOTERS" WERE TOO STUPID TO MANAGE OUR MONEY HENCE THEY DID IT FOR US WHEN SOC SEC WAS CREATED--ONLY FOR SOME 65 YEARS LATER FOR LBJ TO SIGN THE BILL ALLOWING THE THEFT TO FUND THE WAR ON POVERTY FROM THE SOC SEC TRUST FUND---SO NOW JUST WHAT SPECIOUS EXCUSE WERE YOU REFFING TO? OR JUST HYPOCRITE MUCH? HAD YOU READ MY OTHER POSTS YOU WOULD NOT HAVE MADE A FOOL OF YOURSELF WITH THIS CRAP ARGUMENT---</comment>

<comment>Perhaps I didn't make my queation clear, dd, because you didn't answer it.Have the democrats ever refused to consider and vote on a supreme court nominee in an election year?Perhaps you can concentrate a little better now that you have all that other stuff off your chest.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats have nobody to blame but themselves.  When Reid used the nuclear option, he turned the Senate into a majoritarian power bloc.  Well, the Democrats are not in the majority anymore, and they don't have the power.  Get over it.  There is absolutely no constitutional requirement that the Senate confirm anybody, or even hold hearings, as the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 last year.</comment>

<comment>I'm not claiming one side is inherently less susceptible to making a foolish blunder than the other - just that the GOP did it to themselves this round.</comment>

<comment>I think what was foolish was announcing it. That's like putting a target on your back.</comment>

<comment>Supreme court justices were excluded from the nuclear option,preston.  The nuclear option was introduced because republicans refused to confirm lower court judges.</comment>

<comment>Obama should do what he actually can do, which is to name a recess appointment if there is a Senate recess of more than three days.If his choice was a moderate one, he or she would likely be confirmed by the next Senate. </comment>

<comment>So you are saying, just accept the fact that GOP is a bunch of traitorous nincompoops?I disagree.  I feel quite strongly that GOP will be out of power pretty quick with this kind of philosophy.  Dems will play it to the max.</comment>

<comment>Where did I say that?Don't worry, I think the GOP are "nincompoops" too. I'd rather Obama just name a sensible recess appointment (if the chance occurs) and make their precious little heads explode.</comment>

<comment>My apologies.He already missed the chance at a recess appointment, but I believe it would have been a mistake that would have given the GOP a reason to howl.  Recess appointments are for emergencies.Instead, the GOP is once again going Full Idiot, and in a way that will hurt them for a long, long time.  This is the GOP's biggest self-inflicted wound since Trump.  And the list of self inflicted wounds is getting impressively long....</comment>

<comment>When aren't they howling?The Senate loves it some recess and more than three days of it between now Jan. 20, 2017 means Obama can make his choice. Why not really make them howl?</comment>

<comment>Which would last until the end of his term...</comment>

<comment>Yep. Crab people such as yourself demand we all inhabit a world of meaningless gestures, so hopefully you can admit the greatness of this strategy.</comment>

<comment>Cry me a river you Pogue </comment>

<comment>Where does this anger come from, son?Did your truck stop dependapotomus leave you for dark green Jody?</comment>

<comment>Once the GOP said on Saturday, Feb 13th, that they wouldn't allow the vacancy to be filled, no matter who was nominated, I'd argue that's an emergency. And they were in the middle of a recess that lasted at least a couple weeks.Besides, the Constitution doesn't require there to be an emergency. Just that the Senate be in recess, which it was. He should have filled every vacancy in the federal government once they said that. Every District, Circuit, and Supreme Court vacancy, and every Executive Branch vacancy, too, just for good measure.And then, when they cried foul, he could simply have responded that if the Senate isn't going to fulfill its constitutional duties, then the President is free to exercise his constitutional powers to bypass them. Teach them that it would've been better for them to play ball than to take their ball home with them when they know they can't get their way.</comment>

<comment>SEEMED TO WORK FOR THE DEMS WHY NOT FOR THE REPUBS? DON'T LIKE IT FAIR EH??</comment>

<comment>How do you get so much STUPID into two non-sentences?Impressive.</comment>

<comment>GET EDUCATED AS TO WHAT THOSE DAMN DEMS HAVE SAID ON THIS MATTER--JUST AS THE LIES THE DEMS HAVE ALWAYS CLAIMED ONLY THE REPUBS WANT TO HARM SOC SEC AND MEDICARE WHEN ONLY THEY PASSED A LAW DEFUNDING THEM AND THEN CONTINUED THE DEM THEFT FROM MEDICARE WITH A STARTING SUM OF $515 BILLION TO MAKE THE POS O CARE LOOK FISCALLY SOUND--ALL LIES --STUPID MUCH?

<comment>LOL...silly progressive.</comment>

<comment>LOL...popcorn.  Premature ejaculating popcorn.</comment>

<comment>Why is that whenever the republicans do something the democrats don't like, the first words we hear are "traitor" and "racist."? Get a life.</comment>

<comment>Only when you SHIT ON THE CONSTITUTION, traitor-boy!</comment>

<comment>And your little weasel President hasn't? Apparently according to you, you nit wit, anyone that doesn't agree with you or does something you don't like, they are a traitor. Kind of a two way street to my view.</comment>

<comment>That move would just further feed into the "lawless Obama" meme (even though it is perfectly legal), and would only fire up the Republican base.</comment>

<comment>THOSE WITH YOUR IDEA SAID THE SAME BEFORE THE 2010-2012-2014 ELECTIONS WHERE ONLY THE PRES WAS THE DEM VICTORY--</comment>

<comment>The GOP will keep the Senate open.</comment>

<comment>I agree... I guess we'll know the game is afoot if the Senate does just that. Could get awfully silly around the holidays.</comment>

<comment>I wish he would hurry up and do that.</comment>

<comment>"GOP BETRAYS COUNTRY AGAIN."Anyone who supports this kind of behavior is a traitor to the nation.  Do your job, Republicans!  The Party of NO cannot be tolerated any longer.</comment>

<comment>Well then, how about President Obama doing his by ceasing to lie about, inveigle, and obfuscate the Constitution? He has clearly over-stepped his authority by attempting immigration law (a clear violation of article 1, section 8) and our Democratic Senators haven't said a peep about that. Obama has made numerous attempts to bypass Congress with his "Executive Orders" which are making law and those Bozo's won't say a thing as apparently they have zero problems shirking their responsibilities as elected representatives. This is political bullcrap and I'm really really getting tired of it. This country has gone to the flipping Dogs in the last seven years, specifically as Congress can't seem to do the job they were elected to.Keep complaining you bloody fools, it only makes you look as retarded as much of the country believes you already are.</comment>

<comment>Change the subject much?No one is fooled.  Half your problem is that you think everyone else is as stupid as you are.</comment>

<comment>So, essentially you are saying "lets talk about this subject and ignore the other subject." Though they are inextricably mixed. Sounds logical to someone without logic.</comment>

<comment>There are other articles on your topic.   They are OLD AND NO ONE CARES ABOUT THEM, but they are there.   Go comment on those, you freaking knee-jerk ideologue.See how my comment saying "no one is fooled" has many thumbs up?  See how yours has none?  Know what that means?  It means NO ONE IS FOOLED.  Except the fool, and that be you.Go ahead, embarrass yourself some more.  You are a laugh riot.</comment>

<comment>Your "Thumbs up" come from fools like yourself that agree with you. So what? America is full of deluded nit wits these days that also believe life, society, and the government "owe" them a living and a perfect, safe, and long future without having to do anything for it other than opening their mouths and complain."Knee jerk?" At least I spent half a lifetime defending and earning my right to my thoughts, unlike you, you goddamn bitchy little fool. You're welcome big mouth.</comment>

<comment>Consider it with whatever weight you like, but God Almighty seems to have hit the nail on the head, and you seem to have... embarrassed yourself some more.  That's just what he predicted.Can you do it again, please?</comment>

<comment>> lets talk about this subject and ignore the other subject.Wow, after about 530 comments Eric finally learned how online comment boards work! Tell your mommie you earned a cookie.> Though they are inextricably mixed.It seems just everyone else can talk about the topic at hand.</comment>

<comment>ROTFL, you are a winner! "It seems just everyone else can talk about the topic at hand." All I've seen is sniping, bitching, and insults. Yea, sure, that's "the topic at hand."Race relations are at the worst I've seen in 50 years. The economy is in a shambles. The entire world is dealing with a refugee crisis not seen since World War Two. Muslim radicals murder people seemingly at will. Many people seem to believe that society owns them a living and not that they owe society. Some people can riot and burn city blocks and be hailed as "Hero's" while another person gets shot dead realistically speaking for camping without a permit while carrying a firearm. Our very own President has been attempting to circumvent the Constitution on a daily basis since he took office.So I'm a jerk because I think that is messed up and that our current President is responsible for these issues. Well, no accounting for rational thought.</comment>

<comment>What about the fact that you don't know what an executive order is, or what the Constitution says, suggests that the Senate does not have to do its job?</comment>

<comment>Ester, I've read it more than ten times. How many times have you read it? "Executive Orders" have the weight of law, however trying to make an "End Run" around the responsibilities of Congress just doesn't make the act legal.</comment>

<comment>Yes, "obviously."Funny how what lawyers and judges have to carefully weigh through the elaborate process called judicial review is always "obvious" to nut-jobs like you.Learn to read for understanding.  And learn to spell, for goodness sakes.   You are making a fool of yourself.</comment>

<comment>Oh, good, he's typing....He can't figure out what word he misspelled.  What a hoot, Esther!Easy to bait, this one is.</comment>

<comment>If a single misspelled word is more important to you than content, then that merely defines and accentuates exactly how callow you are Anita.</comment>

<comment>Callow?Maybe you should stick with the words you do know.</comment>

<comment>"Callow" used to describe a young person who does not have much experience and does not know how to behave the way adults behave.I believe my context was exactly what I intended. You might try "cruising" a dictionary yourself "Mr. Helper."I may point out that your insistence on anonymity and a refusal to use an actual name merely demonstrate your arrogance and self righteous attitude and is far more telling than anything I have to say. You are a "wonderment" and a perfect example of deluded and warped thinking yet have no personal clue as to the matter. Realistically speaking "Mr. Fusion" you're nothing more than a "chicken shit coward" with a big mouth and an attitude. </comment>

<comment>Yes, I know what it means. That though was not the proper place to use it. It doesn't make any sense to call someone making a proper and honest observation, "callow".</comment>

<comment>I believe "attitude," "narrow thinking," and "small minded opinions" deserve the appellation.It is very apparent that your continuing desire to make snide comments yet totally fail to address any of the issues of the original comment suggest you too deserve the same.</comment>

<comment>You don't know content when it smacks you in the face.</comment>

<comment>Please point out one misspelled word. And if that is your biggest problem, well then, tough."Funny how what lawyers and judges have to carefully weigh through the elaborate process called judicial review is always "obvious" to nut-jobs like you."What's funnier yet are people like yourself (apparently) that have no problem with the Democratic obstructing the process, but the other party are "Evil" if they use or promote the same tactics. If that is "you" in your picture, you sure haven't learned much in your life.Oh, and the sentence structure of your sentence is awkward.</comment>

<comment>You really can't find it?  Not surprising, since apparently you missed the larger half of Esther's post too.You really are a piece of work.  You are not helping your side.</comment>

<comment>There is a difference between "missing" and "ignoring" part of Ester's post. Of which your behavior and responses set the example for me.</comment>

<comment>How many times have you read it? "Executive Orders" have the weight of law,Nope. But then I wouldn't expect you to understand that.</comment>

<comment>"Executive orders have the full force of law when they take authority from a legislative power which grants its power directly to the Executive by the Constitution, or are made pursuant to Acts of Congress that explicitly delegate to the President some degree of discretionary power (delegated legislation)."And you accuse me of not being able to read or understand? Right.</comment>

<comment>The Senate does not have move on an Obama nomination.</comment>

<comment>Well said.  I like the way you have absolutely no support, and the stunning way in which you avoided using a complete sentence.You are a perfect example of the mindless, uneducated GOP base.  Do you drive a Cozy Coupe?http://www.littletikes.com/con...</comment>

<comment>Cupcakes, you could beat me in a political debate.</comment>

<comment>Pretty sure I've already done that several times.</comment>

<comment>"Pretty sure I've already done that several times."Where? You have made zero points and have merely reduced your debate to "name calling" and innuendo. Maybe you should run for office, you already have all the correct "moves" and method of political debate locked down solid.</comment>

<comment>Quite entertaining (in a macabre  sort of way) how people like you can completely support the actions of one party while condemning the other party for doing the exact same thing.Democrats can refuse to entertain a SCOTUS nominee while a Republican President is in office, yet it is unacceptable for Republicans to do the same to a Democratic President. Can you say "Hypocrisy" Anita?</comment>

<comment>Except that did not happen. Are you on drugs?</comment>

<comment>Obama has utterly rained destruction on the Republicans.  The death spiral they're in is a joy to watch as they are forced by their batshit crazy base to make dumber and dumber politics moves while tea baggers froth at the mouth.   It almost makes every moment Ive had to watch fox news or listen to dumbaugh worth it.  Thank you Obama. </comment>

<comment>Enjoy your delusion. I don't think it will last much longer.</comment>

<comment>You don't think, do you?</comment>

<comment>Yup. There has only been a single President elected into office from the same political party as the former President after that President served two terms or more in office, and that was Harry Truman. Barrack Obama wouldn't make a good pimple on Harry's butt.</comment>

<comment>hee hee. </comment>

<comment>Well come back here in November and we'll discuss  who is delusional then.   😁</comment>

<comment>Ya ya, Obama sumptin', sumptin'. That ends every argument about the Republicans being such self serving a$$holes.</comment>

<comment>Your ability to write succinctly and cogently is astounding Bubba. You have a big mouth but you haven't show much otherwise."Self serving a**holes?" Sure thing Bubba, like "Black Lives Matter" isn't a self serving and bigoted organization? An organization that focuses on a single race and not humanity is a bigoted and prejudiced organization. Period. What ever you have been smoking, I'd stop. It's ruining your brain.</comment>

<comment>Snore. Come back in Jan as neither side expects a new judge to be appointed in a election year. </comment>

<comment>What half is that?</comment>

<comment>What's your idea of non-batsh!t-insane?</comment>

<comment>The population unlike you.</comment>

<comment>Why do you say that?</comment>

<comment>OK, so you're part of the batshit crazy segment of the population. Most of us aren't like that.</comment>

<comment>What makes me crazy?</comment>

<comment>It has happened before, but that was the old days, when Republicans were not treasonous, and they did their jobs.  Now the GOP is too bent upon self-immolation to be bothered with the Constitution.I don't know about "half," but the ones that want the Constitution to be ignored are traitors.</comment>

<comment>And the Democratic Party hasn't ignored or twisted the content of said document during the last seven years? Silly boy.If you haven't read it throughly yourself you are just relying on the good intentions of others to be truthful, right? Sure, seems logical.</comment>

<comment>Any other parts of the Constitution you don't like?</comment>

<comment>You should try reading it. It says the President can appoint a nominee. It doesn't say he /she has to be immediately approved.</comment>

<comment>The "do your jobs" thing is amusing. I voted for my congress critters to block Obama at every turn. In doing so, they are doing their job exactly.</comment>

<comment>You know, if I could only find someone to vote for who swears to do as little as possible, I'd probably start voting again.</comment>

<comment>More anecdotal evidence that the GOP's base is no longer a conservative party or one interested in governing the nation.  Meet your destroyer: his name is Trump.</comment>

<comment>Why don't they just title this article "When Will The Whites Just Go Ahead And Die Off Already So We Can Have Our Hsppy Brown Country?"?To be fair, half the articles on this site could have that title...</comment>

<comment>I just wish I could believe that about Obama, but his actions no longer have much of a relationship with his words.</comment>

<comment>Would you feel better if they held the hearing, then said no?</comment>

<comment>Their duty is to obey Obama and not the Constitution?</comment>

<comment>Article 2 Section 2 - The Senate doesn't have to give consent but at the very least they need to advise the president and the president needs to nominate.  Flatly stating they won't consider anyone is a breech of their oath of office to uphold the Constitution.He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.</comment>

<comment>Where does it say WHEN they have to do it?</comment>

<comment>It doesn't lay out a specific timeline, you are right about that.  Of course, reasonable people would probably make assumptions about how long they should take based on historical precedent but they certainly can take as long as they want.... they just have to do it at some point.</comment>

<comment>The same Dems piously bloviating about Constitutional duties are the ones who pledged to filibuster Justice Alito's nomination in 2005 - including Obama.</comment>

<comment>You mean the same Alito now sitting at the Supreme Court?  Well at least the Dems are bad at obstruction; they need to read the Republican play book.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you could hold off on your whinging until HopeyChangey actually nominates somebody.</comment>

<comment>We both know that, even if Obama were to resurrect the corpse of Robert Bork and send it shambling into the Capitol as his nominee, the only Senate hearings would be for impeachment on charges of necromancy.</comment>

<comment>No comparison whatsoever... Obama has not even nominated anyone and the Republicans have already sworn to ignore their duty to advise and consent, no matter who is nominated.McConnell jumped the gun and now the GOP has been exposed for what it is: the petulant party of "No".</comment>

<comment>What with McConnell and Kimberly Jean Bailey Wallace Davis McIntyre Davis, I suspect that something in the water in Kentucky leads its elected officials to believe that they can go ahead and cash their paychecks while refusing to do the work that they hired out to do.</comment>

<comment>And don't forget their completely inexcusable treatment of Robert Bork and what they tried to do with Clarence Thomas.</comment>

<comment>Is holding full Judiciary Committee hearings and a vote on the merits in committee and then in the full Senate "completely inexcusable"?How so?</comment>

<comment>Bork was among the most qualified jurists in history.  He had a thorough understanding of the Constitution.  I believe every or nearly every majority opinion he had written for the D.C. Circuit been affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court on appeal, every DISSENT on the DC Circuit court he had authored  resulted in the Supreme Court reversing the majority and adopting Bork's dissent.He and Thomas got an up-or-down vote in the Senate  but only after severe character assassination by Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Bork was among the most qualified jurist in history.  He had a thorough understanding of the Constitution.“I’m not an expert on the Second Amendment, but its intent was to guarantee the right of states to form militia, not for individuals to bear arms.”Robert Bork, 1989"The National Rifle Association is always arguing that the Second Amendment determines the right to bear arms.  But I think it really is people’s right to bear arms in a militia. The NRA thinks that it protects their right to have Teflon-coated bullets. But that’s not the original understanding.”Robert Bork, 1991“The Second Amendment was designed to allow states to defend themselves against a possibly tyrannical national government.  Now that the federal government has stealth bombers and nuclear weapons, it is hard to imagine what people would need to keep in the garage to serve that purpose.”Robert Bork, 1997</comment>

<comment>And your point is???.....</comment>

<comment>That if Bork had actually been seated on the Supreme Court, he'd currently be reviled by the contemporary NRA-driven right wing.  You know, the kind of people who respond to the election of a Democratic President with upside-down flag logos and conspiracy theories about the imminent destruction of America.I thought it was pretty clear.</comment>

<comment>He had stated repeatedly that he wanted to overturn recent precedents... that is the sign of a bad jurist.  I have been disappointed how activist the Roberts court has been.  Respect of precedent is one of the core issues Obama has had in selecting judges.</comment>

<comment>Bork was a fascist and a racist and Thomas has proven himself to be a total moron. Next.</comment>

<comment>Typical juvenile liberal behavior:  name-calling, slandering and showing a complete lack of reasonable thought.</comment>

<comment>How about the fact that Bork was found in court to have illegally fired the Watergate special prosecutor?  The Attorney General refused to do it and resigned; his deputy refused to do it and resigned; this made Bork acting AG.  He then fired the special prosecutor, for which - and this is in Bork's own memoirs - Nixon promised him a Supreme Court seat.You know good and well that, if the "R's" in that story were "D's," you'd have been there in 1987 demanding that such an obviously venal political tool never be allowed near the Supreme Court.Not to mention that you probably wouldn't have been very happy with him if he had been confirmed, as he believed that the Second Amendment only guarantees the right of Americans to serve in a militia.I get it, though.  The right-wing media has been preaching the Martyrdom of Saint Robert since 1987.  Why would you care about what actually happened, when you've got a story that just feels like a great man got railroaded by those wascally wabbits on the other side of the aisle?</comment>

<comment>Oh, yes.  Watergate.  Liberals are still obsessed with that while while they ignore the far worst things that Hillary and Obama have done.By the way, any thoughts on Ted Kennedy's disgraceful behavior during the Bork nomination process.  Kennedy's detestable comments and slander of Bork was quite an act of hypocrisy coming from a man who was drunk when his car went off a bridge and let his female passenger drown. He then ran a hid while he sobbered up and then used his family's influence to get out of it.  Yes,  there are 2 America's, an America where a liberal Democrat get away with behavior resulting in someone's death and where other man is  vilified for being faithful to our founding and laws.Ted Kennedy was such a despicable person intellectually, morally, ethically, spiritually.  That his supporters allowed such a slob to represent them for more than one term shows their lack of depth and their gutter ethic.  The Left's attack on Bork remains a low point in American politics approached only by their attempt at Justice Thomas and their attacks on nominee Judge Janice Brown.By comparison, Robert Bork was genius at many levels.  His loss to the court was a dramatic blow to U.S. justice.</comment>

<comment>I love how the first half of your post sneers at being "obsessed" with a criminal conspiracy conducted with the documented full knowledge of the President that happened in 1971-72, and then quickly pivots to your obsession with one person's crime that actually went before a court and then a separate grand jury in 1969-70.I know Watergate is "ugh, ancient history" here in 2016, but it happened just fifteen years before Bork's hearing.  You know for a fact that, if a Democratic President's Solicitor General had broken the law to be promised a Court nomination (and remember, this is discussed in Bork's own memoirs), and was then nominated for the Supreme Court by a future Democratic President, you'd be cheering for any Republican Senator making a speech as overwrought as Kennedy's during the confirmation hearing.Yeah, Kennedy was full of s**t when he said that Bork dreamed of a resegregated America, when he'd "only" stated that the federal government was "overreaching" by using the federal courts to ensure minority voting rights in states that had consistently violated those rights.  Then again, you support a political movement where multimillionaire entertainers regularly allege that the Obama Administration is a fifth column for Islamic terrorism, so maybe you can quit pretending that only one political faction has a monopoly on bulls**t speeches.Any thoughts on Bork's Second Amendment views?  If he were a Supreme Court justice, you'd be assailing him as a RINO traitor after his first gun rights case.</comment>

<comment>I love how people like you ignore Hillary's violations of the law with regard to national security and Obama's near-total hostility to the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>I love how you can't help but change the subject to whatever you've been reading on Breitbart lately.  It's OK, it's obvious you don't actually know anything about Robert Bork's actual opinions or career.  It's just silly that you keep trying to conceal this by basically jangling your keys and saying "But...but...look over here!"</comment>

<comment>I didn't know that.  If the promise of a SCOTUS nomination was quid pro quo for the firing that Elliot Richardson and William Ruckelshaus had already refused, then Bork should have been disbarred and imprisoned.</comment>

<comment>The promise came after the firings, according to Bork's posthumously released Saving Justice.  His willingness to break the law to please his boss was venal; a straight-up transaction would have been utterly criminal.He also revealed that he never regretted it, believing that he made the best possible decison for the sake of the Justice Department.  You know, instead of for the rule of law.He was a legitimately brilliant man in many regards, but the episode revealed a weakness of judgment that should have disqualified him from any sort of bench, let alone the highest one.  He would have been a titan of legal academia had he devoted his career solely in that direction.</comment>

<comment>Rubio did not have any of his facts straight.  He is fighting a losing battle and cannot possibly win the Republican nomination.  His demeanor is childish and he needs to go back to be the mayor of some town in Florida.</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court can function at less than full strength, but that is an undesirable situation.  To my understanding, there is a tradition (not a hard and fast requirement) that where the Court is evenly divided, the case is often put over for reargument.  That often involves some of the most consequential of cases.  (Most decisions of the Court are unanimous or are decided by lopsided margins.)  Here that could include cases argued at any time in the term -- possibly the Texas abortion rights case that will be argued next week.If confirmation of a new justice must await the inauguration of a new president, the earliest practicable date of assuming office would be in the spring of 2017.  By then, oral arguments for the 2016-17 term of court will likely have been completed, (such that the new justice will not participate in the decisions) and the docket of two complete terms will have been adversely affected by the absence of a full strength Court.</comment>

<comment>Me and the Stache man agree.</comment>

<comment>Sometimes they just have a narrower ruling that can get a majority.... but yeah, I think there will be a handful of cases they wait on.</comment>

<comment>Can Democrats get Republicans to move on Scalia's replacement?Sure.  Let the Republicans pick the nominee.   Otherwise, the Senate is under no legal obligation to anoint any of Obama's leftist picks for the Court.</comment>

<comment>No they don't have to give consent, they do need to at least consider the nominee though.  Besides, most of Obama's picks have all been considered judicial centrists.  Obama has specifically said they he doesn't think jurists should be creating law on the bench in reference to the Roberts court.</comment>

<comment>Considered by whom?</comment>

<comment>By legal scholars.</comment>

<comment>Liberal ones.</comment>

<comment>One of their most disingenuous statements, and there are many, is that "The American People should choose the next justice". In the Nation's History, the American People have never chosen a Supreme Court Justice. It has always been the responsibility of the sitting president to appoint a nominee and the responsibility of the Senate to hold hearings on that nominee, with an up or down vote. President Obama is doing his job, the Republicans in the Senate, as usual, are shirking their responsibilities.</comment>

<comment>Schumer told the American Constitution Society in 2007 that Democrats "should reverse the presumption of confirmation," because the court was "dangerously out of balance." At the time, George W. Bush was president.</comment>

<comment>Point being?</comment>

<comment>You guys are hypocrites.</comment>

<comment>He was referring to the rather radical judicial philosophy of recent Republican picks... they didn't have many problems when more center-right people were nominated.  Alito is pretty far outside the mainstream in terms of jurisprudence though.</comment>

<comment>Following the Constitution is radical?</comment>

<comment>I have read the constitution, pretty much all of the issues that come before the Supreme court are not directly assessed.... that is why we have judges in the first place.  Part of our judicial constitutional understanding is precedent... so overturning many precedents is considered pretty radical.  I assure you that every judge honestly believes they are following the constitution.</comment>

<comment>Would overturning Korematsu v. United States be radical?</comment>

<comment>It would not be radical, but how likely is it that a similar case will reach the Court?</comment>

<comment>The Dems have a way of over reach.</comment>

<comment>Were there a vacancy, Biden argued, Bush should “not name a nominee until after the November election is completed,” and if he did, “the Senate Judiciary Committee should seriously consider not scheduling confirmation hearings on the nomination until after the political campaign season is over.”</comment>

<comment>He was wrong to say that.</comment>

<comment>In June 1992, as the Senate was about to enter a prolonged recess, Biden made a speech bemoaning the politicization of the confirmation process — hence his suggestion of not holding a hearing in the heat of a presidential election —  and what he saw as George HW Bush’s refusal to properly consult with the Senate in selecting a nominee. In fact, just 10 minutes after calling for temporary inaction on Bush’s hypothetical candidate (there was no court vacancy at the time), Biden actually promised to consider a moderate Supreme Court nominee.“I believe that so long as the public continues to split its confidence between the branches, compromise is the responsible course both for the White House and for the Senate,” he said. “Therefore I stand by my position, Mr. President, if the President [George H.W. Bush] consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.” Watch it here:http://thinkprogress.org/justi...Of course, Myrtle McConnell, et al, don't want a moderate Justice.  They want someone as reactionary as Scalia.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for providing that context.</comment>

<comment>Holy chit!   Who are you trying to convince?   Those POSs don't have the mental abilities to understand  a rudimentary argument like that.   They use that clip of Biden because their idiotic base can't discern facts because they've been eating tbeir own shit for decades.   I have been delighted by their stupor and confusion over what they have become.   But a reasonable argument  like the one you presented seems like a waste of time brother.  But thanks and it makes a ton of sense. </comment>

<comment>Who has Obama nominated?</comment>

<comment>He is, as he should, looking at a list of possible nominees, and will choose one to put forward. He never said he'd nominate someone on the day Scalia died. He will put forth a nominee. The question is whether or not the Republicans will act on that nomination, or continue to drag their feet like two year olds having a temper tantrum.</comment>

<comment>You guy whining about the obstruction of the non nominated.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans have already publicly proclaimed that they will obstruct. This is not an abstract argument.</comment>

<comment>Until Obama nominates someone, it very much is.</comment>

<comment>OK wait a few weeks when it will no longer be hypothetical. </comment>

<comment>What I'm curious about - if the GOP argument is "let voters decide" will they acquiesce to whoever Clinton nominates if she is elected? After all, the voters will have spoken.</comment>

<comment>I have to think this was just a huge stumble by McConnell, perhaps based on wishful thinking that Trump won't be the nominee.  But Trump probably will be the nominee.  And Obama will absolutely nominate a telegenic, impeccably-credentialed individual (and yes, likely one from an electorally-significant ethnic population).So McConnell wants the debate to be over "Obama's nameless nominee," which it will be for another week or so.  After that it becomes "the GOP won't even meet with [actual, well-credentialed, human being's name].  They'd rather put the choice in Donald Trump's hands!"  And on that, the Republicans will lose huge.</comment>

<comment>I fear, so will America with a Trump living in the White House.</comment>

<comment>It is a "no brainer" between (a) getting one moderate justice confirmed by the Republican senate and (b) highlighting Republicans' disloyally unconstitutional obstructionism as a crucial reason for electing Democratic president, senators and Congresspersons [who will be filling at least two seats on the Court].Obama should nominate a solid liberal who is inoffensive to independent "moderates" and Democrats should decry "Republican treason" from now until November.</comment>

<comment>Why, why does The Atlantic keep applying Betteridge's Law of Headlines?</comment>

<comment>Refusal to consider SC nominees is a breach of the Separation of Powers. The Senators engaged in this unconstitutional obstruction are violating their oaths of office.</comment>

<comment>no it's not .....smarten up</comment>

<comment>Republican Senators are thwarting the President's constitutionally prerogative (and constitutionally obligatory) appointment-power. It's an open-and-shut attempt at a power-grab by the Senate, and it is a violation of  the Separation of Powers. </comment>

<comment>Yes. Except no, it's not.“The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee receives a vote.”— Sen. Harry Reid, May 19, 2005</comment>

<comment>What Reid says is true enough. If the President doesn't actually seek the consent of the Senate - as for example, Bush didn't, in his Harriet Myers nomination - then no vote need be taken before the President withdraws the nomination. But it is the President's unique power to appoint; and if he insists on a vote for consent for his nominee (no matter if the Senate tells him they intend to reject the nominee), it is their constitutional duty to uphold the President's prerogative, and affirmatively respond to the nomination. To do otherwise, is to stifle not merely a nominee, but the nomination-PROCESS. This is tantamount to a denial of the President's appointment power, which is unconstitutional - and in fact a breach of Separation of Powers.</comment>

<comment>'it is their constitutional duty to uphold the President's prerogative, and affirmatively respond to the nomination'So you want the Senate to be a rubber stamp. Why even have the requirement in the constitution to have the Senate consent if that wasn't the goal?</comment>

<comment>And by the way... the President doesn't need the consent of the Senate to nominate someone. He could nominate you or I without asking anyone what they think. Now actually confirming his nomination... I suspect neither of us stands a chance.You have a rather bizarre interpretation of the constitution.</comment>

<comment>The statement of the President's appointment-power in Article 2 Sec. 2 is very compact, and it requires close reading to unpack the logic of the appointment-process.I said that the Senate has the prerogative, and also the obligation, to 'affirmatively respond' to the President's nomination. "Affirmative response" does not mean simply accepting the nominee. It means giving a positive response - an answer: yes or no. If the answer is no, fine then - the initiative shifts back to the President, where he can select another nominee and try  again.Withholding consent, on the other hand, stifles the entire appointment process; it is logically the same as the situation where the President has nominated no-one at ALL; which is not only contrary to the facts, but is the effective nullification of his Constitutionally-enumerated power to appoint. This is a violation of the Constitution, and in point of fact a power-grab.</comment>

<comment>“The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote.

<comment>Suddenly all the liberals are strict Constitutionalists.When Friar Cuck (aka Francis) shoots off his mouth, you're all papists, too.</comment>

<comment>Where are the liberals getting their crazy talking points?</comment>

<comment>From Rubio's liberal counterpart handlers.</comment>

<comment>President Obama is shrewdly exploiting the Senate's unwillingness to do its job regarding the Supreme Court vacancy.  The vacancy occurred while the Senate was in recess, but the President prudently declined to make a recess appointment without first submitting a nominee and giving the confirmation process a chance to work.  The President now appears to be exercising the due diligence that the task of selecting a nominee calls for.If, as Senator McConnell promises will be the case, the Senate abdicates its responsibilities after a nominee is submitted, it may be appropriate to revisit the prospect of a recess appointment.  From what I have read, I understand that the Senate is scheduled to recess on July 15 and reconvene in early September.  No Senate business will be transacted in the interim.  A recess appointment at that time would allow the Supreme Court to begin its October 2016 term at full strength.The Senate leadership may try to frustrate a recess appointment by holding pro forma sessions every three days, during which only a few Senators will appear and no business will be transacted.  If they attempt that kind of subterfuge, that should come at a price.A quorum of the Senate is a minimum of 51 Senators.  By rule, a quorum is presumed to be present in the absence of inquiry as to whether that is or is not in fact the case.  If a quorum is shown not to be present, the only action that can legitimately be taken is adjournment, or alternatively, the presiding officer can direct the Sergeant-At-Arms to compel the presence of a quorum by rounding up absent members.At the first pro forma session following the July 15 recess, Vice-President Biden should gavel the Senate to order, whereupon a Democratic Senator should seek to ascertain the presence of a quorum.  If no quorum is present, the Vice-President should direct a roundup of the absent Senators.  Beginning with the twenty-odd Republicans (pun intended) who are running for re-election, who will likely have returned to their home states.</comment>

<comment>Democrats can keep a light a on the issue via the media, and heat on the issue via political advertising,  but only voters can get the GOP to move.  July polling in the five swing states will impact the outcome a lot more than any dog and pony press conferences on the court house steps.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans would be committing  political suicide if they approve a left wing Obama candidate who would join the other 4 to eliminate the 2nd Amendment.</comment>

<comment>They would be committing suicide by agreeing with the 80% of Americans who want common-sense gun control measures?</comment>

<comment>100% of Americans agree that there should be common sense gun regulations.  There is nothing, however, that Obama has proposed which even remotely falls under the definition of "common sense".</comment>

<comment>Is that because common sense doesn't contradict that any criminal or mental case can go to a gun show and buy whatever they want with no background check?  Or is it because of Mr. Obama's skin color?  Maybe black folks can't have any common sense, what do you think?</comment>

<comment>Ah... the lie of the 'gun show loophole'.No-one, be it at a gun show, basement, parking lot or internet sale, may buy a gun from a licensed dealer without a background check. It is, and has been for years, a felony.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that the point of calling it a loophole is that guns are sold on the private market (a lot of them at gun shows) by people who are not licensed dealers right?There is no lie about it.  No background checks are occurring in these transactions.</comment>

<comment>Calling it something it is not... is a lie.A smidgen of honesty would have people calling it the 'private sale exemption'. But that doesn't sound as scary... now does it?</comment>

<comment>It sounds like an obfuscatory way around the fact that, depending on the state, a large minority of gun show sales are "private sales."</comment>

<comment>You're basing your flaccid argument on semantics? </comment>

<comment>If not for NRA-supported laws, we might actually have some idea as to whether your comment actually has any effect on gun transfers to criminals.  The WaPo fact checker accepted that 80-90 percent of criminals obtained firearms on the secondary market.  But it is apparently true that if you're looking for a gun illegally, you're less likely to go to a licensed dealer.</comment>

<comment>https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Just wanted to point out that you're either unaware of how gun shows work, or are being deliberately obtuse.  Maybe your state requires an FFL to sell guns in any quantity at a gun show, but everywhere I've lived allows "private collectors" to set up tables at gun shows, and they couldn't - and are not required to - access NICS even if they wanted to.  Throwing "licensed dealer" in your post elides the simple fact that there are many legal ways to by firearms without passing a background check.</comment>

<comment>Ok, most of Obama's candidates so far have been centrists.  I don't think anyone is arguing that a judge can eliminate the 2nd Amendment.  Now, plenty of people do probably think that it is fine to go back to how the 2nd Amendment was interpreted for most of our history until the Rehnquist and Roberts courts but that is another argument entirely.</comment>

<comment>All four liberals on the Court have said explicitly that they don't think the 2nd Amendment protects an individual right and Ginsburg said that SCOTUS should overturn Heller.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that is how the second amendment in its full was viewed until the Rehnquist court.  I mean, heck, even Bork agrees with the four "liberals":(“[T]he National Rifle Association is always arguing that the Second Amendment determines the  right to bear arms. But I think it really is people's right to  bear arms in a militia.  The NRA  thinks  that  it  protects their  right  to  have  Teflon-coated bullets. But that's not the original understanding.”</comment>

<comment>Justice Scalia's opinion in Heller left considerable room for regulation of firearms consistent with the Second Amendment.  How do you surmise that a case to modify the individual right determination would reach the Supreme Court?The gun rights proponents would not argue for Heller to be overruled on that point, and the State or local government whose regulation is being challenged would likely argue that the statute or regulation falls within the "presumptively lawful" range of regulation to which footnote 26 of Heller refers.Can you give a hypothetical example of a governmental regulation of commercial sale or carrying of firearms which is likely to be upheld only if the individual rights doctrine of Heller is overruled or modified?</comment>

<comment>You do realize that the concern that SCOTUS can 'eliminate' the 2nd Amendment can at best be described as ignorant, right?Overturning Heller is a valid concern, but that simply returns us to how the 2nd Amendment was interpreted and enforced for well over 200 years.  Hardly seems a threat to the Republic.Becoming hysterical about something that can't happen hardly helps your case.</comment>

<comment>What real world SCOTUS litigant is likely to argue for the individual rights component of Heller to be overruled?</comment>

<comment>The only pressure that matters to the GOP senators is from the approximately 30 private citizens who put out AM talk radio propaganda for the base.I hope that this matter puts to rest permanently the myths that (1) the GOP "reveres" the Constitution and (2) that the Supreme Court was "liberal." Both are flat-out falsehoods.</comment>

<comment>Reid says it best...“The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee receives a vote.”— Sen. Harry Reid, May 19, 2005</comment>

<comment>When the words "Both Sides Do It" come out of a conservative's mouth, their position is garbage and they know it.Also - you're taking the statement completely out of context. There was no pending nominee at the time, and it was a call for moderate center-right nominees, not an embargo on nominees and hearings altogether.Nice try, though.</comment>

<comment>Nothing out of context about it. It was simply Reid pointing out the obvious.And if you think only conservatives say 'both sides do it' then you're a political hack.</comment>

<comment>BSDI is a conservative thing. The MSM likes it too because they appear "impartial."</comment>

<comment>'BSDI is a conservative thing.'What an foolish/incredibly lame thing to say.</comment>

<comment>President Obama can choose who he wants for the next Supreme Court justice. It is decision to make and if Republicans don't like it that's too bad. They have had their way on the  Supreme Court for years and it is about time that was changed. Liberals need to have the deciding vote for a change. Enough of this conservative crap we have had to put up with for years from Republicans across the board. Republicans love the Constitution until it doesn't favor their agenda like President Obama not being authorized in their eyes to appoint a new justice. They know full well it is President Obama's duty to do that and theirs to allow him to do so. Imperative that voters come out in droves and vote out all these obstructionist Republicans so we can get things done for the good of the country.</comment>

<comment>Obstructionist Republicans?In recent history Democrats have obstructed Robert Bork, Miguel Estrada, Priscilla Owen, David McKeague, Carolyn Kuhl and launched vicious attacks on Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito.In 2006 Obama voted for John Kerry's filibuster of Bush's nomination of Justice Alito.In 2007 Chuck Schumer told Bush (with 19 months to go in office) that Bush could not appoint any more justices because it should fall on the next President.At least today's Republicans are only looking at 10 months.  But hey, why let little things like facts get in the way of an agenda?</comment>

<comment>The Democrats did not obstruct Bork, Uncle Thomas or Alito.  They held full hearings before the Judiciary Committee, a Committee recommendation and a full vote of the Senate.And there was no filibuster of then-Judge Alito.  That has become the Big Lie du jour.  A filibuster begins with an unsuccessful vote to invoke cloture.Both Presidents Bush submitted nominees as to each SCOTUS vacancy occuring during their tenures.  That didn't harelip the devil, and neither will President Obama's submission of a nominee for the instant vacancy.</comment>

<comment>So, you add up a bunch of lies and call them "facts"? </comment>

<comment>'Republicans love the Constitution until it doesn't favor their agenda like President Obama not being authorized in their eyes to appoint a new justice.'Except they never said he wasn't 'authorized'. He's free to nominate any person he wishes.There is simply no timeline mandated either by the Constitution or by law in which the Senate has to act."“The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee receives a vote.”— Sen. Harry Reid, May 19, 2005".</comment>

<comment>The Constitution states it IS the duty of the President to nominate a new justice. The Senate said they would NOT entertain anyone the President nominated even before the President put forth anyone! That is disgraceful and disrespectful but not surprising. So they are NOT doing their Constitutional duty by announcing their intent to obstruct right off the bat.</comment>

<comment>'So they are NOT doing their Constitutional duty by announcing their intent to obstruct right off the bat.'Utter nonsense. Until the duty arises, there is no obstruction.And even when there is a nomination, there is no mandated time frame.</comment>

<comment>How can they object to someone without even knowing who he or she is?  Not even giving that person a fair hearing is dereliction of their patriotic duty. They can choose not to go along with the Presidents choice. This whole business shows how un-American Republicans are. Their hatred for President Obama far outweighs true patriotism. That's not only sad it's disgusting.</comment>

<comment>They haven't objected to anyone. They objected to everyone. Right, left, middle.Until it actually happens, your comment is pointless.Plus, as Harry Reid said on May 19, 2005...“The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee receives a vote.”Of course that paragon of fairness Schumer said on July 27, 2007...'How do we apply the lessons we learned from Roberts and Alito to be the next nominee, especially if—God forbid—there is another vacancy under this president? … [F]or the rest of this president’s term and if there is another Republican elected with the same selection criteria let me say this: We should reverse the presumption of confirmation. The Supreme Court is dangerously out of balance. We cannot afford to see Justice Stevens replaced by another Roberts, or Justice Ginsburg by another Alito. Given the track record of this president and the experience of obfuscation at the hearings—with respect to the Supreme Court, at least—I will recommend to my colleagues that we should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee except in extraordinary circumstances.'Sorry, but the anguished cries of despair from those on the left don't have much of an effect on me. Always remember... if the right has done it, the left likely has as well (and vise versa). Sad, but true. Would that both 'sides' acted like adults. However, until they do, the whining from one side or the other is rather amusing.</comment>

<comment>Technically correct, but at least admit it's a total dick move. Follow the thread of that end logic and eventually we'll have a stalemate until there is a president who also has a majority in the Senate, in which case any civilized, rational human would and should respond with WTF?!?! </comment>

<comment>I don't understand why they need all the posturing when all they have to do is twiddle their thumbs for a few months.</comment>

<comment>If I was to hazard a guess, it's so they can sit back and laugh while the 'left' melts down.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps because the Court does not function as well with eight members as with nine.  The most important decisions of this term have not been decided (some have not yet been argued), and an evenly divided Court may result in important decisions being held over for reargument.  If the Court goes until the spring of 2017 without a full component of justices, that reargument may not occur until fall of next year, with decision sometime in 2018.Confirmation of one appointed by the incoming President will not likely occur before spring of 2017, after all of the next term's plenary review cases will have been argued.</comment>

<comment>The idea that this is somehow non-partisan on the part of the Democrats is the best laugh I'll have all week.     I'm a staunch supporter of the Democrats in Congress and of Obama on most things, but don't stretch my credulity with silliness about not having a partisan motive in a Supreme Court nomination argument.    The Democrats want a liberal on the court to tilt it away from the 3 decade run conservatives have had, and I am completely behind them in that wish.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your comment, but I'm not aware of anyone claiming that the Democrats are "non-partisan" on this issue.</comment>

<comment>As per the article, the Senate Democrats are.</comment>

<comment>Ah, very good, thanks.  Of course, in addition to their partisan interests, Senate Democrats are defending decades of senatorial custom and norms.  (Every Supreme Court nominee since 1875 has received a vote---up or down---from the Senate.)</comment>

<comment>“The duties of the Senate are set forth in the U.S. Constitution. Nowhere in that document does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote. It says appointments shall be made with the advice and consent of the Senate. That is very different than saying every nominee receives a vote.”— Sen. Harry Reid, May 19, 2005</comment>

<comment>But surely some nominee should receive a vote. And McConnell and others have said that no nominee will receive a vote, that it doesn't matter who is nominated, what his or her qualifications are, what his or her ideology is, etc.</comment>

<comment>Of course, we need the Supreme Court. It should eventually be fully staffed.My post was aimed at the morons who think the Constitution demands the Senate act and act now... despite the fact that there's no-one to act upon.</comment>

<comment>But if this Senate can delay indefinitely, then so can any future Senates. Six constitutes a quorum, so the Senate could de facto eliminate the Supreme Court through attrition and claiming there's no requirement to vote on anyone.Besides, the Constitution says thatUS Const., Art. II, § 2, cl. 2It refers to the President. Who is the President? President Obama, of course. It doesn't say anything about the President-elect, or some future President, getting to do this. If President Obama has the power to do this, then it must, necessarily, be accomplished while he is President, during his term. To delay it beyond then is to deny him his constitutional powers. There is no explicit deadline, but there is a practical, implied one. Come January 20, 2017, if Scalia's vacancy hasn't been filled, the President will have permanently, and irrevocably, been denied his constitutional power.Beyond that, the Senate must give its advice and consent on his nominee. Come January 3, 2017, this Senate will cease to exist. So, in order to uphold its duty, the Senate must act by then. There's no explicit deadline here, either, but, once again, there's an implied, practical deadline. If it fails to act by the end of this Congress, then it will permanently, irrevocably, have abdicated its duty to act.There's no explicit deadline, but logic tells us, if the President is required to perform some act, and the Senate is necessary to allow that President to perform that act, then, necessarily, the deadline is the earlier of when the new Presidential term begins and when the new Congress begins.The Senators don't have to act now, as there's not even a nominee for them to act upon. But, once there is a nominee, I would argue that they're required to act prior to January 3, 2017.</comment>

<comment>'But if this Senate can delay indefinitely, then so can any future Senates.'Yup.'But, once there is a nominee, I would argue that they're required to act prior to January 3, 2017.'Then surely you can point to that in the only document that applies. The US Constitution.Should there be a time frame? Sure. Yet there isn't. We're all free to argue what we wish... yet no matter who does the argument, it carries no weight until the constitution or the courts say otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Okay, good to know you were only addressing that tiny minority of Americans who think the Senate should act on a nominee who hasn't been named.  (And that, presumably, you don't have---or are saving for a later date---any argument in favor of what Senate Republicans have declared they will do.)</comment>

<comment>-Sen Mitch McConnell, May 19, 2005-Sen Jim DeMint, April 20, 2005-Sen Chuck Grassley, May 8, 2005Sen Jim DeMint, May 22, 2005</comment>

<comment>So you agree that politicians, the media and commenters on most topics are hypocritical assholes.Good for you.</comment>

<comment>Ayotte was foolish to back this as well. The commercials misleading the public into believing we have a voice in the nominee so delay is just ridiculous. If that is the case, we voted four years ago to keep Obama, he is still the Pres. Furthermore since Justices are nominated and voted on by the representative government, the founding fathers never intended us to have a voice other than our government representing us. Ayotte got my vote, and now no longer has it. I hope that is the stance many Americans take on obstruction.</comment>
