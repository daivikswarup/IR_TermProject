<comment>The flag in my front yard is racist. Suburbs are racist. Private schools are racist. The name of my town is racist. Gun ownership is racist. Expecting our immigration laws to be enforced is racist. I tuned these liberals out a long time ago and I'm not alone.</comment>

<comment>Everything's racist to these people. So what does it matter either way?</comment>

<comment>It doesn't, unless you have some sort of internal code by which you live your life.It doesn't, if your sole moral barometer is "will this piss off libruls?"</comment>

<comment>Communitarianism is a code.</comment>

<comment>Jimmy. Jangle  If a black person commits crime/pedophile, we lock him up or banned him from going near to school areas: are we being racist? Just because he is black?We ban Muslims because they commit world wide terror bombing planes, Boston event, 911 etc etc. We ban them because they are terrorists. Yes, not all Muslims are terrorists but they all believe and pray on their Quran 5x per day daily since childhood. What do you think will happen? Muslims self radicalized BECAUSE they recite these doctrines thousands of times over a life time. Please spend time to read below. Your stand is causing more undocumented terrorists from terrorist strongholds to come into your streets to bomb and kill your children and family. These people DO NOT HAVE ID. No amount of checking can screen them because there is NO DATA on them. They can buy a passport just as easily as a bottle of coke.Here is the Quran:"Allah is the greatest of the deceivers." - Qur'an 3:54The Messenger of Allah said: “I have been commanded to fight against people till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah”. - Muslim (1:33)"Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, even if they are of the People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued." - Qur’an (9:29)Allah loves those who fight in his way."- Qur’an (61:4)"Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah” Qur’an (4:76)"Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward." - Qur’an (4:74)"Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not." Quran  (2:216)"Not  equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt, and those who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home. Unto all in Faith Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive andfight Hath He distinguished above those who sit at home by a special reward" - Quran (4:95)"The holy war is a religious duty, because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force"- Ibn Khaldun  Allah’s apostle said, "I have been made victorious with terror."- Bukhara (52:220)"Every Muslim should be a terrorist."- Dr. Zakir Naik, Islamicspeaker "Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers.” Qu'ran (3:151)"Strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them" - Qu'ran (8:12)“Kill the disbelievers wherever you find them.”- Quran (9:5)"Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us."- Tabari 9:69“Allah said, ‘A prophet must slaughter before collecting captives. A slaughtered enemy is driven from the land. Muhammad, you craved the desires of this world, its goods and the ransom captives would bring But Allah desires killing them to manifest the religion.” - Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 484</comment>

<comment>Samuel 15:3 Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.'"</comment>

<comment>Nice try, but Jews did not force Judaism on other cultures and there is no history of that happening.</comment>

<comment>Wars of extermination of those who adhered to their  non-Judaic religion are referred to in several of Judaism's biblical commandments, known as the 613 Mitzvot. Scholar Carl Ehrlich states the rules of extermination provide guidance to modern Israelis as models for reclaiming the land of Israel. Rabbi Manis Friedman  in 2009 was quoted as saying: "The only way to fight a moral war is the Jewish way: Destroy their holy sites. Kill men, women and children"</comment>

<comment>Still didn't try to convert them, and really, what culture does not destroy its enemies or invaders.   The rest of your response is just ancient academic trivia and BS.  Muslims invaded Europe and tied to establish a caliphate, and it wasn't over 3,000 years ago.</comment>

<comment>If it was ancient academic trivia, extremists would not be using the tomes to validate their deeds in modern times.</comment>

<comment>they just killed off everything to preserve their own culture. it's ok--it was god's word</comment>

<comment>That stock Liberal answer only shows that you are as ignorant of Judaism and Christianity as you are of Islam -- and as a liberal in good standing, you can't take any religion seriously, or believe that anybody else does.</comment>

<comment>I was referring to domestic terrorism. The few examples you gave of domestic so-called Christians, like the KKK, is ridiculous. Most of the domestic terrorism is perpetrated by Muslim radicals or liberals.– Jared Loughner, the Tucsonshooter – Leftist, Marxist.– Nidal Hasan – Ft Hood Shooter:Reg­istered Democrat and Muslim.– Aaron Alexis, Navy Yard shooter –black liberal/Obama voter– Seung-Hui Cho – Virginia Tech shooter: Wrote hate mail to President Bush and to his staff, registered Democrat.– James Holmes – the “Dark Knight”/Colorado shooter: Registered Democrat, staff worker on the Obamacampaign, #Occu­py guy,progressive liberal, hated Christians.– James J. Lee who was the “green activist”/ leftist took hostages at Discovery Channel – progressive liberalDemocrat.– Amy Bishop, the rabid leftist, killed her colleagues in Alabama, Obama supporter.– Andrew J. Stack, flew plane into IRS building in Texas – Leftist Democrat– Ohio bomb plot derps were occupy Wall St leftists.– Harris and Klebold, the Columbine Shooters – families registered Democrats and progressive Leftists.– Bill Ayers, Weather Underground bomber – Leftist Democrat.– Lee Harvey Oswald, Socialist, Communist and Democrat – killed Kennedy…</comment>

<comment>The KKK are Christians in name only. Everybody knows that their behavior violates just about every Christian value. Besides, the organization has progressively dwindled over the decades and we don't hear much about them anymore (unlike radical Islam) who we hear from all the time.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>If the KKK were still active like they were many decades ago, the mainstream liberal media would be all over any negative behavior the KKK would engage in. The mainstream media jumps at the chance to report ANYTHING that fits its agenda.A very, very small number of Christians engage in any sort of terrorism in the U.S. and most of the attackers have been proven to be deranged people anyway, which is why the attacks have occurred to begin with. And in these rare instances, the Christian community immediately and publicly condemns these attacks since the overwhelming majority of Christians do NOT support terror of any kind.When Muslims attack, the rest of the community is often conspicuously silent. There have been relatively few public condemnations from Muslims when these attacks occur.Even "moderate" Muslims, those who don't personally engage in terror, very often condone and support jihad and terror perpetrated by radical Islamic extremists. The surveys show that the number of "moderates" who support terror are in the millions. Check out the following:http://louderwithcrowder.com/m...</comment>

<comment>The rare instances of Christians attacking in the U.S. are individuals who have no affiliation with any terrorist organization. And yes, with the possible exception of Timothy McVeigh, they have all been proven to be deranged individuals.The Muslim attackers in the U.S. have been largely doing so based on an ideology. They are members of (or at least supporters of) radical Islamic extremist organizations like Al Queda or ISIS.</comment>

<comment>Jimmy Jangle - there's one problem with that.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of Muslim terrorist attacks every single year and have been for centuries.  Show me this many Christian terrorist attacks.</comment>

<comment>i am Muslim i would never use those verses you took out context to harm anyone. One very important thing you need to know is you cant interpret the quran literally. You need the Hadith or book of traditions. Only highly learned scholars can do that.</comment>

<comment>You know they read the Bible literally too, right ? As a staunch Secularist, and Atheist, i have plenty of issues on Islam. Women's rights, for starters. But i'll do you the justice of conceding your point. It's a symbolic text.</comment>

<comment>The Quran is not a symbolic text to Muslims, but the literal, final revelation of Allah. Muslims never adjusted to the idea of reading scripture symbolically like most Western Christians did.</comment>

<comment>Well , in that case, do you mind explaining your Authoritarive knowledge to the Muslim guy i was talking to ? Apparentely, he's got less knowledge of his own religion than you.- NOT !</comment>

<comment>That Muslim guy never called the Quran a "symbolic text". You did. And he only talked about his own religion, which I must take at face value; however, his implication that peaceful interpretations of Islam are the only true Islamic interpretations is falsified by a quick look round the Islamic world. The fundamental Islamists are in the ascendant and the moderates are cowed or on the run in most of the conflict zones.</comment>

<comment>The Muslim Brotherhood and ISIS have their own scholars, do they not? Millions of people follow Yusuf Qurudawi on TV. I believe Abu Baghdadi, the self-proclaimed Caliph, also has a Ph.D. in Islamic Studies.So it's not an answer, is it? ISIS quotes Sura, verse and Hadith for everything they do.</comment>

<comment>Those names you just mentioned are not scholars. The Scholars don't lead armies and force other faiths to convert to Islam.  For example ISIS leader is Takfiri-google Takfiri and check their history.  How about if say trump who is Nazi like is Christian scholar? It wont make sense.</comment>

<comment>I presume that Muslim Imams are classified as Muslim Scholars.Then Google "Imams deported" and see that there are many Imams preaching "Hate speech" & "Encouraging terrorism"</comment>

<comment>No imam is just someone who leads prayers, Mufti is the one that Muslims ask for guidance on matters regarding legality of doing or not doing. There are some Imams that may incite violence but same goes for Christian clergies..it is human nature, human beings are not angels some are sinners and use their authority to manipulate young people who follow them</comment>

<comment>HogwashDictionary Definitions for Imam1. a Muslim leader of the line of Ali held by Shiites to be the divinely appointed, sinless, infallible successors of Muhammad2. any of various rulers that claim descent from Muhammad and exercise spiritual and temporal leadership over a Muslim region.3. the prayer leader of a mosque</comment>

<comment>Shiite Imam  different, they are not like Sunni imams. like i said  'Mufiti' is the your guy fo knowledge not shiite imam  or SIS (i omitted  the'  I 'for bec i dont recognize them as ISlamic)</comment>

<comment>You're wasting your time arguing with an anti-intellectual zealot.</comment>

<comment>Just so we are on the same page, do you think giving out welfare, affirmative action, reparations, etc., based on skin color, IS NOT RACIST?</comment>

<comment>It's not based on skin color it's based on what happened to people with that skin color</comment>

<comment>Right, 150 years ago.  Racist a whole.</comment>

<comment>What is racist? Thinking your race is superior to another .  I think , who cares .  </comment>

<comment>wait - what's your point?  you're tired of people complaining about racism, so you're going to support a racist?</comment>

<comment>You're way behind . It's not racism to protect your country </comment>

<comment>Who do you think you're protecting it from, and how do you plan to protect it?  The answers to those questions are what determines if you are acting in a racist fashion.  The Germans thought they were protecting themselves from the Jew's, and that was most certainly racist.  Trump is using the exact same rhetoric as fascists from the 30s.</comment>

<comment>I just don't see the nazi comparison.  I'm not into sharia law either and it's already here ( Loretta lynch)</comment>

<comment>You're blind if you don't see it.  The man is literally calling for  mandatory registration of religious minorities.  He blames all the countries problems on immigrants.  His slogan "make America great again" is the same call to restore the nation to an idealized past greatness that fascists used to take power.  He encouraged his followers to physically assault protesters at a rally.  His "foreign policy" if you can call it that is to bomb everyone he doesn't like.  The man is a cheap thug in an expensive suit.The only thing he's missing is a red arm band.</comment>

<comment>Trump never called for registration of Muslims.'Make America Great' is fascist? So what is acceptable, 'Make America Weak and Go Round the World Apologizing'? That's been BHO's program, all right.</comment>

<comment>No I don't see what you describe , it's just a lot of far left tripe .     This country needs to protect its interests and not listen to the leftist / Marxist  bullshit .  The USA is fascist already , look at the statue of Abe Lincoln with his arms on two bundles of sticks .   Taking things by force to preserve the nation of their belief .   Obama and company have not helped the cause of peace with their droning campaign killing innocents either .   We need a leader that stands for the citizens of the USA , not bringing in foreign voting blocs to retain power .  Also , one with principles and scruples .   Not like the dem party who is calling half the country their enemies n trying to destroy them and putting people on welfare on the middle classes money . We need someone who helps all classes succeed and doesn't Play class warfare , gender warfare , race warfare. Etc.  Get my drift .  Of course the left is going to demonize anyone who stands in their way , it's the Marxist playbook .     The whole plan is to destroy the middle class to destroy capitalism, the only system that did bring some prosperity to all peoples and gave business people a slice of the wealth that before had only been going to government </comment>

<comment>Oh, please...</comment>

<comment>By the way , I haven't heard anything about the citizens of the USA. I heard a moratorium on visas Etc </comment>

<comment>What are we protecting it from? Did you notice what happened in San Bernadino last week? How many times must something like that happen before you will notice it?</comment>

<comment>See, this is my point.  I'm aware of the San Bernardino shooting, but most mass shooting sprees in this country are not committed by Muslims, most are committed by white supremacist types who buy into Trump's narratives.http://timelines.latimes.com/d...This is why I say it's important to understand exactly what you think you're trying to protect us from, because going after Muslims isn't going to solve the mass shooting problem in this country.</comment>

<comment>Crap. The last few mass-shooters were registered democrats including the nut cake that shot up Planned Parenthood. The male half of the shooting team in San Bernadino described himself as "very liberal" in his profile on an online dating website.And do you think those violent crimes that are committed in the most violent cities in the U.S. (like Chicago) are perpetrated by people who voted for Romney?I suggest you turn the channel. The liberal mainstream media has betrayed you.</comment>

<comment>What about Jimmy Carter, who banned Iranians from coming into the country and deported 15,000 from the U.S. By your definition he should also be a racist. But I suppose he gets a pass because he's a liberal, huh?</comment>

<comment>Fortunately, you are representative of a pretty small segment of society.... maybe 10% at best... Sane people know that racism actually is still pretty bad. The GOP had a chance when their stance was "Sure there's still racism.... it will never completely go away, but the cure can sometimes be worse than the problem itself....". They stand ZERO chance when their message is "There is no racism... and let's round up Muslims and put them in camps!" We're looking at an electoral landslide in 2016 for the Democrats, and very possibly the split of the GOP into two parties....</comment>

<comment>Have you checked the polls lately? Go see how treating terrorist attacks as a gun control problem is polling. Hint: Not Well.</comment>

<comment>You forgot to mention, the name "Chicago" can also be racist.</comment>

<comment>"The flag in my front yard is racist. Suburbs are racist. Private schools are racist. The name of my town is racist. Gun ownership is racist." Said nobody ever.</comment>

<comment>Surely you mean Winston Churchill not Adolf Hitler.It was Churchill who banned all immigration of potential enemies into the UK during WW2.

<comment>Thoroughly supporting Trump and Winston Churchill before him.We are at war with the Islamic State and ation shoulld be taken accordingly.</comment>

<comment>That's the OP's main point.Just about anyone that is even slightly conservative gets called a Nazi by progressives.  The Republican base just doesn't care anymore.</comment>

<comment>but I thought that was just about exactly his point. Liberals used it as such a weapon that we picked it up as a joke in the office.</comment>

<comment>Not in any office owned by a Fortune 1000 company.... Not in very many offices in Boston... or New York... San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Austin, Santa Fe, Philadelphia, or even Chicago....You're also losing women at an astounding rate. Hispanics, blacks and Asians have already left...You guys need to learn how to count. 20% of the country isn't a 'silent majority'.....</comment>

<comment>You're a clown?  A sheep ?  Most likely </comment>

<comment>So that last election, the Congress, State Houses, Governors etc. all a fluke?  People see the phony war on woman is just BS and are sick of being called racist every time a minority wants a handout.  Wake up.</comment>

<comment>Au contraire. Given what conservatives post on the Internet, I think liberals have underestimated the depth of their prejudice towards anyone who isn't exactly like them.But maybe the subset of conservatives who hold forth in the digital arena is skewed.</comment>

<comment>Prejudice is just human nature. Racism is systemic. Are we talking about the same thing here?</comment>

<comment>Something being 'human nature' doesn't make it acceptable. Racism still is widespread. It still needs to stop. People who actually preach pro-racist views need to be identified and called out and rejected. They need to be punished not by the government... as they have freedom of speech... but by the people... the marketplace....</comment>

<comment>So should we have affirmative action based on race?  Don't answer, Liberals like you are born liars anyway.  Color seems to matter very much to you idiots only when handing out welfare grants etc. Doesn't it?  What ever happened to equal opportunity under the law.  Guess that didn't work out for you the way you wanted it to.  YOU RE A RACIST AND A JERK!</comment>

<comment>You can't judge conservatives by internet trolls.</comment>

<comment>Liberals are bigots by definition</comment>

<comment>That's convenient and childish and shows a lack of critical thinking skills.</comment>

<comment>So, when you call a racist person a racist... They're not racist anymore?  I don't follow.</comment>

<comment>When you call people racists because they don't buy into the left wing liberal agenda, the traditional meaning of the word has no meaning anymore. It is like when a gentleman is called sexist by a woman's libber, even though a gentleman would hold the door for anybody out of common courtesy.  You see, the libber thinks everyone but her and her friends are sexist.  Got it?  You and your liberal friends are stupid.</comment>

<comment>a 'woman's libber'? Really? Is this 1972?</comment>

<comment>Apparently it is, ask Hillary about the War on Women.</comment>

<comment>Are you Archie Bunker?</comment>

<comment>Are you Edith Bunker, dingbat?</comment>

<comment>Are  you exaggerating for effect or because you're silly enough to actually believe that tripe?</comment>

<comment>Trump is establishing an initial negotiating position, while collecting oodles of free media -- and making the other GOP candidates side with the liberals, as Erick Erickson has pointed out. Only Cruz is smart enough to abstain.There is method to Trump's madness. Conor should read The Art of the Deal before writing more nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Or perhaps they now embrace it as a badge of authenticity. I mean, the whole justification for Trump's racism is that he's "tellin' it like it is!"</comment>

<comment>When actual white supremacists are cheering for Trump you can assume it's racist .</comment>

<comment>You're right. And the same thing has happened with feminists screaming "sexism" every time they can't get their way. We're just not taking these bogus charges seriously anymore.</comment>

<comment>The author is absolutely right. America is watching Trump, and deciding. He may have had a surprising amount of Democratic support at one point. He lost any chance with me on the insult to the journalist. I saw that as a true shot at seeing who he was when nobody's looking and I didn't like it one bit. It's interesting to see Ted Cruz support rising while Trump is making his gambles on what he thinks Republicans want. I guess that means I better find out who Cruz is, with his rising stock. I don't even know yet.</comment>

<comment>I appreciate the glimpse you provide of a decent Republican's thought process. When evaluating Cruz, consider his grating personality. His fellow GOP senators generally dislike him.  http://www.politico.com/story/... As a law student at Harvard, Cruz refused to study with anyone who had not gone to Harvard, Princeton or Yale as an undergraduate. http://www.thecrimson.com/flyb...He would not wear well as President.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is no more grating than Obama, who has for years sounded like a scolding schoolmarm.  Clinton, likewise, and in addition she has a harsh voice.If you want foreign policy knowledge, patriotism, and nice manners, vote for Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Rubio talks a great game, that is certainly true. But I think he is not mature enough. I don't sense depth in him. He ran with Tea Party support but is happy to be an Establishment candidate now that Bush is failing...but what does HE believe?</comment>

<comment>He believes in getting Marco Rubio elected.</comment>

<comment>Rubio isn't my first choice, but virtually all politicians believe in getting themselves elected.  What's your point?</comment>

<comment>Mostly to insinuate casually that he is not of strong convictions, and has shifted them several times in his political career. Now, in some cases this can be good, if it means that the person has a willingness to compromise or to reassess conclusions in light of new developments. In Rubio's case, I would associate it more with political cowardice than leadership.</comment>

<comment>Cruz may be even worse than Trump. Trump says things to shock the public, stay in the headlines and rile up the bigots, whether he believes what he says or not. Cruz, on the other hand, is a true believer.</comment>

<comment>If you are looking for who Cruz is...read here-- http://www.vox.com/2015/12/8/9...</comment>

<comment>"He isn't implying that you're racist to stigmatize you. Rather, he’s implying that you're xenophobic bigots with no regard for a minority group in order to win you over."You won't convince Trump's followers. They believe they're righteous.</comment>

<comment>You mean Trump's dwindling list of followers.</comment>

<comment>Trump thinks he can apply market economics to politics.... he's wrong.In a highly competitive marketplace, saying something that ostracizes 80% of the public but locks in 20% of the market is a HUGE win... most companies never lock in 20% of an overall market.Politics is more like the Coke/Pepsi market. Sure there are other companies, but Coke/Pepsi are so huge that between them they have an enormous majority of the market. So Coke NEVER unveils a marketing plan that would ostracize 80% of the market. To them that would be a catastrophic loss! Dr. Pepper recently did a soda aimed at 'men' (Dr. Pepper 10), figuring their share was so low, even if NO women bought it they could still increase market share overall by getting 20% of males to drink it.... A similar campaign by Coke or Pepsi would result in immediate dismissal of the Advertising management...That Trump is so dumb to not see this seems impossible.... which is why many people keep saying he is actually trying to find a way out of the race....</comment>

<comment>They won't even acknowledge bigotry - they will just say that discrimination against Muslims isn't prejudice it is "common sense." Common sense being defined as the sum of their fears and hates...</comment>

<comment>I've no idea what your point was. Please, spell it out in full. Interval train on.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is clear. No it is not accurate. Muslims feel morally entitled to rape their conquests. Catholics know that rape, even pedophilia, is morally wrong. Even the priests who were committing pedophilia knew it was morally wrong. Rape happens throughout the world. That some Catholics rape, does not make it a rape culture. When you have a culture that morally justifies rape, then you have a rape culture...Clear enough for you?</comment>

<comment>Speaking of the Catholic church, it has/is compounding it's wrongfulness by calling homosexuality and pedophilia childbirth aberrations. While the church hierarchy realizes its priests have committed morally vile acts, it wants to believe that those priests were somehow made homosexuals and/or pedophiles in utero - so it's not really their fault. The Catholic Church has overlooked one of God's greatest gifts, which is free will. Man and Woman have free will to be anyone they choose to be. They should be careful, however. Some choices have pretty bad consequences.</comment>

<comment>Pretend that it's the TEA Party that is committing world wide terror and Trump is going to bar the TEA Party members from coming here until he can assure they are safe. That should make you feel a lot better...But you won't. You want to be outraged about Trump.</comment>

<comment>America's popular ignorance of the rules of the game imposed by the Constitution is not a new phenomenon.  But it is extremely rare for a popular spokesperson who touts the flouting of some rules of the game to isolate himself so emphatically and permanently within that demographic, and to extend his apparent reach to "all" rules of the game.He is a marginalized candidate at this point, but his demographic is likely to stay in place, sidestepping their candidate's excesses by insincerely characterizing them as a rejection of political correctness.</comment>

<comment>Ethnic and by-country quotas for immigration have never been Unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>I'm fairly certain he's advocating a religious test.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately the same ignorance (not just of the constitution, but overall ignorance) being discussed comes into play because 80% or so of Trump's supporters think that 'Muslim' is a race or nationality....</comment>

<comment>Turning people back at the border by reason of religion is in fact unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>Trump is keeping most of the journalism community gamefully employed. Ah, well, back to tech and sports news. Here's looking forward to the new Star Wars movie. </comment>

<comment>My son is going to the Star Wars H'wood premiere! I AM SOOOOOOO JEALOUS!!!!!! And he's taking his wife, instead of the person who spent tens of thousands of dollars raising him! Such ingratitude!</comment>

<comment>The old story of political kabuki. Dance about the stage for the vote. Be the candidate that is wanted, needed by the electorate.Because for too long, they've repressed themselves and finally a breath of fresh air and some room to shout out what they really are about and not get ostracized for it.Every human is like this. Always editing, what they say, what they do, so they can belong. Now a national actor prances about giving new life to their répertoire. And when categorized as something negative,  an eruption of outrage, consternation, condemnation, denial, and then finally back to editing what is said and done. It won't last, it can't. The seething racism and discrimination will be squelched and America will go back to its normal routine of pretending to be a free, equal and liberal country. </comment>

<comment>I was watching a TV show a few weeks ago that to me was a good analogy of what is happening in the US. The show was about abused spouses, and one of the counselors said "The most dangerous time for an abused spouse is when they finally decide to leave the abusive relationship. The abuser will see that as an unacceptable loss of control, and will often act out in extreme and dangerous ways...."If that isn't a great analogy for what we are seeing among older, white, European-descended, Christian males.... then I don't know what is. For 200 years they have been 'in control' of the country, and have often 'abused' those not in their group.... women and minorities... and now they finally feel the country getting ready to 'leave them'.... and the results are pretty predictable....</comment>

<comment>For my part, I'm seeing the same thing with a friend of the wife's. The husband in that toxic mix just got arrested the other day for violating a protection order. Hope the wife's friend comes out of this alive. Her husband is a piece of work. Hell, I hope he comes out of it alive. I wouldn't be terribly surprised if he eats a shotgun blast. If he does, I hope he does it before killing his wife and 3 kids rather than after. That's an all too common event.</comment>

<comment>Oh, sure.  They're demanding control of the cops and more whites-only courses on campus, invading study halls and throwing blacks against walls with invectives and threats, disrupting commerce with mass marches, calling for more white employees and white-owned companies.     Try a theory that matches reality.</comment>

<comment>I think the fact that he blazed ahead after calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals may indicate that his is a correct assumption.</comment>

<comment>OK, Conor. Seriously. F*ck you.I am a proud Trump supporter and I fully support the ONLY candidate with the cojones to stand up for regular American people against elitist progressive bullies like you.To start with, considering the unstable situation our country is in - Trump's statement is pretty moderate. He said he only wants a pause on Muslim immigration until he can figure out what the hell is going on.And even Obama just admitted that the visa-waiver system under which the Berdino terrorist wife breezed into the country was broken.The fact is that we DO NOT EVEN NEED an explicit religious test. It will suffice to stop unneeded, unnecessary immigration from the Middle East, Pakistan, Sudan and a few similar countries.  Trump knows that - he could have chosen a more PC formulation to say it, but we need some action on this problem, and the status quo is just not good enough.Finally, we must reject the coming progressive talking-points onslaught to try to paint Muslims as victims here, and invert the reality of who is the bully and who is the victim.1. Opinion polls, even from the liberal Pew Research group, have shown a significant portion of Muslims as supporting terrorism. In Pakistan, according to Pew surveys, a horrifying 72 percent couldn’t bring themselves to express an unfavorable view of ISIS: http://www.nationalreview.com/...2. No Muslims in the USA have been assaulted in bias crimes since the Berdino terrorist attack - yet there has already been a Muslim assault on a Jewish bookstore in New York city.3. No Muslims have EVER, in the USA, been forced to go into hiding from threats - yet five years after the FBI told her to go into hiding - Seattle cartoonist Molly Norris is STILL in hiding, fearing for her life from Muslim threats to her life - for the "crime" of drawing a cartoon that Muslims find offensive.</comment>

<comment>You're delusional if you think Trump is out for you. He's laughing all the way to the bank at you for believing his shameless nonsense.</comment>

<comment>He's the only guy out there speaking honest truths.But you are truly delusional if you think the Clintons have any agenda to carry out besides the one of their Wall Street paymasters.</comment>

<comment>"Honest truths" -- i.e., he tells you what you want to hear. </comment>

<comment>Well, DUH. I already know the truth.I just need a politician who cares about somebody else's opinion besides that of Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein.As a Hillary supporter, you don't have that - unfortunately for you.</comment>

<comment>"honest truths" like latino immigrants are rapists and drug dealers (they're not), blacks are responsible for most white murders (they're not), China is going to destroy us through the TPP deal (China wasn't involved), Muslim-Americans celebrated 9/11 (they didnt't)?  honest truths like that?</comment>

<comment>Since you are, out of ignorance or malice, misrepresenting Trump's words - you are not worthy of engagement.</comment>

<comment>Apparently you are not listening to your demagogue.</comment>

<comment>I think they all have an agenda.</comment>

<comment>A useless observation, even if it were true.</comment>

<comment>First of all, how is the country unstable?Apart from that, Trump has only lately latched onto banning Muslim immigration into the US.  His original immigration ban was on Mexicans, as you undoubtedly recall.  Basically, he wants to ban immigration of, and, ideally, kick out brown people of whatever inclination.  Hence the whole "bigots" thing.  Trump simply has the "cojones," as you put it, to say out loud what the rest of all y'all think.</comment>

<comment>It's unstable since you have increasing numbers of Muslim immigrants who do not support the Constitution, but instead Shariah law - which is incompatible with American values."... and, ideally, kick out brown people of whatever inclination...".You  just outed yourself as a liar and someone not worth engaging.</comment>

<comment>What, have you polled every Muslim immigrant to determine whether they "...support the Constitution...?"  Yer man has advocated kicking out both illegal immigrants and Muslims, so how have I "outed" myself "as a liar?"  *That's* what you support, if you support Trump.  At least be honest about it.</comment>

<comment>Since no one is worth engaging, why don't you go back to Breitbart.com where you belong?</comment>

<comment>There's plenty of Jews in NYC who openly practice Talmudic lawShould we kick them out too?</comment>

<comment>Ha, based on this response I'd say Connor nailed it.</comment>

<comment>If you want to advocate banning or limiting entry to people from certain countries, that's one thing. I might disagree with you, knowing that plenty of foreign Muslim university students would benefit greatly from a few years here, and that quite a few people who put their lives on the line translating for American soldiers are in the queue for entry. But it's at least Constitutionally defensible. A religious test for entry is not. The details matter.</comment>

<comment>"... knowing that plenty of foreign Muslim university students would benefit greatly from a few years here...".That's the problem with you progressives.  You seem to think that the wants  of foreigners matter more than the needs of Americans.  The job of the US government is to put the needs of Americans first."...quite a few people who put their lives on the line translating for American soldiers are in the queue for entry...".I would make an exception for those who helped out the US military in a substantive way, whose lives are plausibly in danger, and who have an impeccable background.</comment>

<comment>The first part is not a zero sum game. A young Pakistani who owes her education to an American university and its surrounding society is less likely to radicalize, compared to one who studied at an ultra conservative madrasa in Pakistan like the twisted terrorist who left her infant daughter to go shoot up a Christmas party. I hate terrorists...</comment>

<comment>You are flat out wrong. In fact, the Times Square bomber, Faizal Shazad came over from Pakistan on an H1-B visa ( even though he was a poor student who got F's in mathematics - proving that the program was being illegally abused - which is typical).Still, he managed to get a US degree and a middle-class job- had a family and bought a house.And then he complained that he wasn't being paid enough, and started to shuttle back and forth to terrorist training camps back in Pakistan.</comment>

<comment>Constitutional protections apply to American citizens and residents only. There are no Constitutional grounds which prevent screening immigrants based on religion or creed. For example, for decades we refused to even let Communists into the country.</comment>

<comment>Communism is not a religion.</comment>

<comment>More class from the Spudmeister.  You represent America's lowest common denominator.</comment>

<comment>Trump could have said, stop all immigration, and then at least he wouldn't look like a man who is willing to violate the Constitution.  There's no way to know whether a person is a Muslim.  If you were actually able to make such a rule, every immigrant would suddenly "convert" or become an atheist.</comment>

<comment>trump is a businessman i am sure at the end of the day he is making deals with muslim businessmen or companies on the other hand he is saying what bigots want to hear and he will keep on saying as long as there bigots and racists and uneducated ppl out there to support him</comment>

<comment>I've never been a Trump supporter, and have long questioned both his viability and sanity since he entered the ring.At first, my thought was "I'm glad he brought up sanctuary cities - that's something I didn't know about, and something I'd like to see change." He added to the discourse (albeit in an ugly way), but having something meaningful to bring to light is more than some.Over time, it progressed to something more like "He says some really foolish things. It's downright amazing that he seems to be immune to his gaffes and ignorance. How are people still taking him seriously?"Now, it's just "...you've got to be kidding me." It blows my mind that anyone with any kind of conscience or even a passing knowledge of history can even pretend this man should lead a trash collection team, let alone the United States.</comment>

<comment>You yourself do not seem to know much about current events or history - you even admit that you just learned about what sanctuary cities are.Perhaps you need to get some more education about current events and history before considering yourself qualified to pass judgement on Trump's proposals.</comment>

<comment>I'm from a region where these cities are almost unheard of. While I follow current events, I hardly think I'm alone - even among much more educated people - in having learned something when that came to light.I guess I'm curious what you think you bring to the conversation by being condescending, rude, and unpleasant?</comment>

<comment>I think that YOU are rude. I am a Trump supporter, and you condescendingly say that he is not good enough to be a trash collector.  That implies that people like me are stupid.Why don't you read your own posts?</comment>

<comment>He has explicitly endorsed banning people based on a religious test. That's fundamentally unamerican. He has run a campaign that has lived on rhetoric, misinformation, bombast, and vague platitudes. His few concrete suggestions of policy have been plausible, but he's bullied his way through debates and made a mockery of the process at nearly every step. I don't think Donald Trump is qualified for the office, and I don't think he'd do a good job. I stand by that statement.I had the humility to admit that sanctuary cities aren't something I was aware of. I fixed that weak spot, and happily admit I'm better for having learned and not just pretended I understood. The man you support for president, by all accounts, lacks the humility and wisdom to do either.</comment>

<comment>You have no reasoned arguments in your posts - merely assertions that you don't like Trump - so there is nothing to argue about here.  As far as your religious test assertion - I have dealt with that in other posts on this thread.</comment>

<comment>I"m yet to see you present one actual argumentheck three posts ago you said you're a Trump supporter out of spite</comment>

<comment>Sanctuary Cities are not as big an issue as the right makes them out to be.  it's basically a policy of cities making the best of a bad situation.  It's less a big "welcome!" sign out front than the city government and police realizing they can't do their jobs if the report every suspected illegal immigrant.Like you think the LAPD would be able to do their job if every Latino they spoke to was worried about being reported to immigration?  It'd be a recipe for disaster.</comment>

<comment>From the standpoint of pure pragmatics I do understand local governments being overwhelmed. I think what bothers me is that it's gone from a pragmatic to a public statement, formal policy, and declarative of local leadership completely defying federal law and *welcoming* those who've broken our laws in how they enter the country. I certainly understand the realities of the situation, but I think that the tone and the mindset (mind you, that's as I understand them to this point) go against both wise principles and against the government's best interest. If I'm incorrect, please let me know - by my own admission I'm far from an expert.</comment>

<comment>I live in a sanctuary city.  There are multiple reasons (some I don't necessarily agree with).There is simply not enough enforcement.  "Rooting" people out also subjects American citizens and legal-residents to state aggression.  Where I live, people usually have refugee status from Central America.  My former housekeeper was illegal (her common-law husband was a legal resident).  Her sister was a victim of systemic rape by the unconstrained gangs in her town (gangs that have their origins in CA penal system and flourished abroad with deportation, not to mention US destabilization of their democratically-elected governments).  The last time we spoke, she (the hk) was released from custody and had applied for asylum.  The American public pays no attention to the anarchy to the South.  Many rational, responsible parents will leave their kids in the US where they are likely to remain alive.  It is a matter of public policy (safety) to keep families intact.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your insight. Like many issues with illegal immigration, the legally right thing to do and the emotionally bearable thing to do certainly seem to be in conflict. However, at least from this outsider's perspective, sanctuary cities seem to only encourage the problem by providing a "safe place" that might entice future illegals. I certainly am not wise enough to propose a solution that protects families and still preserves what I still believe to be important laws and our borders. I hope someone out there is able to find that solution.</comment>

<comment>"That implies that people like me are stupid."Not necessarily.  It also implies that such people are ignorant, poorly educated, xenophobic, scared, etc.Although, when it comes to a lack of education, the polling data support that it's actually true - his biggest chunk of support coming from those without a college education.  In fact, Trump's core base are the same middle-aged, uneducated, white men who can't seem to cope with modern life in general,  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11...</comment>

<comment>Several interlocking clauses, [multi]syllabic words, I think you just called him stupid again. ;-)</comment>

<comment>Not only Trump supporters, but other candidates are mostly reacting against people like YOU - as exemplified in the condescending tone of your post.We dislike progressives like you - and we want to get rid of your type from government.  The last election was a good indicator.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  By all means, add anti-intellectualism to the list.  It just reinforces the "We're afraid of everything not like us" theme.  Worst part is, Trump supporters still want the benefits of the labor and ideas of those they hate.</comment>

<comment>Three sentences. Three unsupported b*llsh*t assertions.You are not even an opponent worthy of serious engagement.</comment>

<comment>"Three unsupported b*llsh*t assertions."The text of your posts are sufficient support.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  People who proceeded past the third grade are your enemy.  You need a Stupidocracy.</comment>

<comment>Ok so you support Trump out of spiteyet you don't want to be called an idiot?</comment>

<comment>You can't very well decry discrimination of moderate Muslims while condemning uneducated white middle aged men. My dad was one. And one of the best people I've ever met.</comment>

<comment>Trump supporters are not particularly ignorant, poorly educated or xenophobic but the progressive, neo-liberal new world order that has emerged since 1968 with its endless wars and totalitarian tendencies has certainly scared the hell out of us.Why Trump?  Why not Trump?  He is no more dishonest and unethical than Nixon, Bill and Hillary Clinton, GW Bush or Barak Obama.  Trump bashes illegals and muslims but you have been bashing the native born whites and christians for a generation now.  You have sown the wind and you may be about to reap the whirlwind.If the imperial presidency is a problem, then why not elect Trump, the candidate who is least likely to be a successful president of the new world order?  At the very least, that might force Congress to reclaim its constitutional functions and actually represent the people who elected them.I could go on but you should realize that Trump's candidacy is most similar to Andrew Jackson's in 1828 and in the tradition of Thomas Jefferson's in 1800.See you at the polls - I think we're gonna' win this one.</comment>

<comment>"Trump supporters are not particularly ignorant, poorly educated or xenophobic"Both the data and the comments of his supporters suggest otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Spudsie, you are pretty dumb...</comment>

<comment>I agree. I remember when he suggested he might run in a previous election. He wasn't serious then so why was he serious this time? Did it have anything to do with Hillary, and how so, exactly? So, at first he mentions the sanctuary cities and sounds like he might enforce our immigration laws but he has morphed into something verging on obscene. We have a constitution which I take is this: it says we are to have religious freedom, unless that freedom infringes our constitution. If being Muslim means bringing Sharia law in, then it's unacceptable. As mentioned, Trump has lost me. He could be just as bad to my way of thinking as Obama is, who I disagree with on so many levels, except this. I only now start to wonder if a combination of indirect fighting against ISIS doesn't have its own merits.</comment>

<comment>WE have a Constitution. OUR Constitution doesn't apply to foreigners just because they want to come to our country. WE get to decide who can come based on what is best for OUR country.Get it now?</comment>

<comment>Sorry, Republicans. You created Trump. You own him.</comment>

<comment>Dems created him. Republicans created him. We all own him.</comment>

<comment>Is there a warranty on him?</comment>

<comment>Did we keep the receipt? </comment>

<comment>Hardly! Trump is pretty much a self-funded egomaniac with little to no mainstream GOP support.</comment>

<comment>except he's the party's frontrunner</comment>

<comment>He's got maybe 30% support, but that's almost certainly where he'll top out. The other 70% is split between a half-dozen other candidates. He's got almost no support from Republican insiders (donors, party officials, etc.) or real ideological conservatives. He's running on a brew of racism and populism that will collapse once the opposition settles on an actual conservative.</comment>

<comment>I think he meant that the GOP whipped up the Republican base demographic to respond to Trump's kind of rhetoric, and now the GOP has come to the realization that it no longer has control of those voters.</comment>

<comment>The GOP Elite is clueless, and has treated the GOP voter base with contempt for decades now. Trump is just taking advantage of the opportunity they gave him.</comment>

<comment>Well, it's certainly true that he's whipped up some segment of Republican voters. I'd argue that most of Trump's supporters aren't true ideological small-govt conservatives, though.</comment>

<comment>Trump is going to make America great again.</comment>

<comment>Trump's ceiling is about 25%, I see no reason for these comments to change that when his previous words have not.  The man obviously is addicted to the spotlight and understands the value of outrageousness to keep that spotlight shining on him.  If there is an appeal, it's that the President and his supporter's statements about Islam minimize that Islam has a real problem with intolerance, bigotry towards religious minorities and violence towards nonbelievers. Trump's answer is to go completely in the other direction, which is not a good approach either.  Unfortunately, when the President and one of the two political parities is in complete denial about Islam's Jihad problem it leaves the door open for demagogues like Trump.Republicans will almost certainly nominate someone with a less demagogic and realistic of view Islam, like Cruz, or Rubio.  The Democrats will almost certainly nominate someone who won't even be able to admit that Islamic terrorists are motivated by their Islamic religion.  Trump's greatest sin here might be changing the conversation from Obama's failed response to ISIS and radical Islam to Trump.</comment>

<comment>I would believe you Tyfereth, but you think an Iranian kid turning out his lights to masturbate is evidence of their nuclear program.Obama's right, when did Islam become the issue?How does Islam have a jihadists problem if no one can legally call for one?Ted Cruz is as much a demagogue and Rubio's statements are barely better You say "never again", but it's happening to Muslims now and they need our support.</comment>

<comment>Islam began Jihad against the Infidels in 632, although an argument can be made that Jihad began in 624.</comment>

<comment>The First Crusade was called in 1095 so miltiant Christianity has been an issue since then too?</comment>

<comment>The Crusades petered out in the 13th C, Jihad never did, its been integral to Islam since its inception.</comment>

<comment>Christain conquest and conversion didn'theck the Ottomans and Europe fought each other all the way up to WW1</comment>

<comment>Then we can both agree that liberal terrorists like obama, hillary, cheney, the bushs, and a host of republican war lover are motivated by their liberal beliefs.not much difference from islamic terrorists dont you think?</comment>

<comment>OK, Tyfereth. Let's hear some straight talk from YOU.The liberal Pew Research polls found out that 72% of  Pakistanis refused to express an unfavorable opinion about ISIS.There are hundreds of countries containing people who want to immigrate to the USA.  Must Pakistan be one of those countries?  And if you think so - how many immigrants should come from there - given the fact I cited?</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump is spot on when he says he wants "to figure out what is going on".Certain GCC countries themselves have stopped issuing visas to pakistanis & bangladeshis. You must be aware of the fact how few existing non muslim bloggers in bangladesh were brutally killed by a group of muslims. Their mindset has always been the same.A considerable number of indian muslims left India  to join ISIS. Those who have been brought back or returned on their own volition did so not out of revulsion . Their grouse being they " could not access & enjoy as many Syrian women as the ISIS could...." .  The hierarchy in ISIS where these "south asians" are not instantly crowned as caliphs bruised their egos. But none of them have a wee bit of remorse. Many have joined their families. Few are kept inside useless Indian prisons & fed enormous amounts of biryani.The other day some Indian muslims have been arrested by Indian Sleuths ( including some serving in Indian Army) for having passed on all vital information of internal security to pakistanis across. Reason- both share the same religion / ideology. They do not believe in values like loyalty , allegiance to any country save their ideology which is highly detrimental to non muslims like us. Period.Read the following :-http://www.theatlantic.com/mag...When 9/11 happened lots & lots of muslims in India etc were jubilant.When Indian Airlines flight was hijacked by muslim terrorists  (tautology) from Pakistan to kandahar Afghanistan , my two Indian muslim neighbours were unabashedly HAPPY. And justified the hijacking. They & their families are now residing in Canada.  Their relatives in America. They benefit immensely from Western education & all comforts. However have nothing save unspeakable contempt & murderous hostility , spite towards Americans , Jews , Israel , Hindus -practically all non muslims.</comment>

<comment>Great post Rajalakshmi. Non-Muslim Indian have more than 1000 years experience with dealing first-hand with Islamic intolerance of non-Muslims.Americans are naive and have very little understanding of Islam.Muslims know this and are cleverly taking advantage of the trusting nature and naivete of Americans. They are banking on the fact that when the majority of Americans finally wake up to the truth - it will be too late.Just like what happened in Europe.</comment>

<comment>Please read the following written by NS.Rajaram attentively:-” The average educated person today, anywhere in the world, is likely to be both confused and frightened by Islam. On the one hand, it is supposed to be a religion of peace that preaches equality and justice for all, while on the other, it is hardly possible to escape the sight of the most unspeakable acts of violence being committed by individuals and groups in its name.To make the situation more confusing, there is no shortage of ‘experts’—Eastern and Western—who tell us that Islamic terror is an aberration that has nothing to do with the ‘true’ Islam.It is fair to say that a majority of the people in the world has swallowed this explanation while remaining ambivalent about Muslims and their behavior.If there is one book on Islam that a concerned person should read, it is Sita Ram Goel’s  ‘The Calcutta Quran Petition’.Sita Ram Goel, one of the world’s most incisive students of Islam, blows away this confusion by giving an unvarnished, scholarly yet highly readable account of the theory and practice of Islam.By a detailed analysis of its scripture and history, he explodes the charade that Islamic terror can somehow be separated from its teachings. In the process, the prolific and erudite Mr. Goel has probably written his masterpiece.To return to the confused state of knowledge about Islam, there has long been a need – more urgent today than ever before – for a work that can explain the theory and practice of Islam for the average reader. This void is now effectively filled by the book under review – ‘The Calcutta Quran Petition’ by Sita Ram Goel.The book could with equal justice be titled ‘Islam for Nonbelievers: Its scripture, history and practice’. The reason for the unusual title is historical.On 29 March 1985, one Chandmal Chopra filed a writ petition in the Calcutta High Court seeking a ban on the Quran under Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code because it “incites violence, disturbs public tranquility, promotes, on the ground of religion, feelings of enmity, hatred and ill-will between different religious communities, and insults other religions or religious beliefs of other religious communities of India.”The Calcutta High Court disallowed the petition, but the issues raised by it remain relevant, especially now when the need to understand the causes of terror in the name of Islam is greater than ever.More significantly for the present discussion, it led Sita Ram Goel to write the volume under review. The sordid details of the case in question would probably be of little interest to the average reader today though they shed much light on the ignoble conduct of the Governments of India and West Bengal in the face of real or perceived Muslim threats.Out of a total of 345 pages, the author devotes no less than 230 pages to a general discussion of Islam that has little directly to do with the Calcutta Petition. These pages, covering Chapters 2 through 10, constitute for all practical purposes an independent manual on Islam, beginning with the message of the Quran. This is what is reviewed here.Quran and the HadisThe first point about the Quran is that it does not stand alone. The Suras (verses) of the Quran were created in specific situations arising out of specific military, political and sometimes personal needs. They invariably reflect the convenience of the Prophet who found it expedient to invoke Allah as authority to have his own way with his people.Seeing this, his favorite wife A’sha once observed, “I find that Allah is prompt to proclaim commandments in accordance with your desire.” This means that the context in which a Sura was created is all-important. Taking Quranic passages out of context can lead to outlandish interpretations like Sir Abdullah Suhrawardy’s sayings of Muhammad, which Mohandas Gandhi hailed in his Foreword as among the “treasures of mankind.”The all-important context for interpreting the suras of the Quran is provided by the Hadis. They may be described as the record of the activities of the Prophet. They are so detailed that it is possible to obtain a more or less complete picture of the private and public life of the Prophet.It may fairly be said that the Hadis rather than Quran form the basis for Islam, for without them the Quran becomes virtually incomprehensible. As Goel makes clear (Chapter 3) there is practically no difference between Allah and the Prophet; Allah does the Prophet’s bidding.This made the great Maharshi Dayananda Saraswati observe, “Allah is the Prophet’s domestic servant.” As Goel explains, this makes the Quran (the ‘Word of Allah’) and the Hadis (‘Acts of Muhammad’) interchangeable.In other words, the Hadis describe the Quran in action, meaning the acts of the Prophet. These in turn became the model of behaviour to be emulated for every true Muslim from the highest to the lowest. As Goel observes:“It is this fixed and frozen image of the Prophet which is meant when a Muslim proclaims his Din (fundamental faith). In fact the Prophet produced a ‘revelation’ (33.21) presenting himself as the perfect model for those who look forward (with hope) for the Day of Judgement. For a pious Muslim, human life is best lived when it conforms to Muhammad’s conduct even in minor matters such as defecating… , cutting one’s beard to a specific size and so on. Islam leaves no room at all for individual initiative or judgment…      In case of doubt, a pious Muslim must go to a mufti (jury-consultant) and obtain a fatwa [ruling] about how the Prophet would have conducted himself in a situation which, according to all sources, the Prophet is not known to have faced.”Needless to say, this is not a climate conducive to progress.This also has a sinister side with far-reaching implications. Since the later part of the Prophet’s career is full of war and bloodshed in the name of Allah, religious war or Jihad is seen as the highest goal of Islam.What the world is faced today – from Kashmir to Kosovo (and now West Asia and Syria, pushing into Europe) – is Jihad or religious war to bring the whole world under the sway of Islam.This reality cannot be wished away as is done by liberal academics in East and West, by giving an abstract interpretation of Jihad. As Walter Laquer, an American expert on terrorism observed,“Many interpreters of jihad in the Muslim world, and an equal number in the West, have explained that jihad has a double meaning: it stands for jihad bi al saif (holy war by means of the sword) and also for jihad al nafs (literally, struggle for one’s soul against one’s own base instinct).Both interpretations are true, but Islamic militants have rejected the spiritual explanation as dangerous heresy. …The Taliban in Afghanistan and many militants (especially ISIS today) are not impressed by the speeches and writings of more moderate exegetists about the ‘poverty of fanaticism’ and the ‘spiritual mission of Islam,’ and this fact is what matters…”The fact of the matter is that influential Muslim leaders see the violent version of Jihad as the only valid one. Jihad to them is “the most glorious word in the vocabulary of Islam,” and by this they don’t mean striving for inner perfection.Goel explains this vital fact with clarity and thoroughness with profuse illustrations from the history and scripture of Islam. As he points out, the Quran studied alongside the Hadis is a nothing but a manual on Jihad – or religious war. Just as the Prophet became the model for Muslim behavior, his blood soaked career became the model for a succession of Muslim leaders down to the present.While the Hadis are indispensable for understanding Islam, they present a bewildering mass of detail to the uninitiated. In Chapter 4 (‘The Prophet Sets the Pattern’), the author takes the reader through the Prophet’s career by presenting a systematic picture of the historical background and the key events.He describes also two interesting episodes that are not widely known: the Prophet’s invitation, in a time of distress, to the Christian Abyssinians to invade Mecca, claiming that his teachings were no different from theirs; and the famous ‘Satanic verses’ inspired by the need to regain the support of the Meccans.In Chapter 5 (‘The Orthodox Exposition of Jihad’), the author produces evidence from primary sources to demolish the claim of modern apologists that Jihad has – or ever had – a spiritual meaning. This ‘spiritual’ interpretation is exhumed only when they feel insecure – as in India today, or when faced with powerful opponents like the United States – to be buried again when conditions turn favorable.Chapter 6 (‘Jihad in India’s History’) may be read as a practical demonstration of Islam in action. It is to be hoped that every policymaker in India as well as the West will read this capsule account of the ‘bloodiest story in history’ – as Will Durant called it – and learn its lessons.Indians in particular must face this historical truth and not seek escape in fantasies written by soothsayers calling themselves historians. This chapter should be made required reading for students in India, if mistakes of the past are not to be repeated.In some ways, the most interesting as well original section is Chapter 10 (‘A Close Look at Allah of the Quran’). In this, Goel compares Allah of Prophet Muhammad with the Mongol sky god Tengiri who inspired Chengiz Khan on his world conquest.Sita Ram Goel shows how from the Jaxartes (Syr Darya) in Central Asia to the Nile, the soldiers of Allah were no match for Tengiri’s Mongols. Baghdad along with its Caliph were reduced to dust literally under the hooves of the horses of Chengiz’s grandson Huelgu Khan and his ‘Devil’s Horsemen’. This fact though is rarely found in history books in use in India. (Tengiri had a redeeming feature though – he was tolerant of all religions.)In summary, Sita Ram Goel has produced a manual on Islam that is a ‘must read’ for everyone concerned about the threat posed by Islamic terror in our time”.– NS.Rajaram.</comment>

<comment>Obviously a disturbing number of Muslims sympathize with Jihad and radical Islam.  I'd favor a vetting process that screened for Jihadist and radical Islamist sympathies.  I'm not sure a blanket ban on Muslims is a good idea though, those 28% might be the kind of Americans we want.</comment>

<comment>"... those 28% might be the kind of Americans we want...".Let's see your "vetting" plan for separating the "bad guy" 72% from the 28% that are anti-ISIS.Oh, and I would like to know how many of that "good guy"  28% support the current stabbing Intifada in Israel. Probably more than a few.</comment>

<comment>You raise a very valid concern about vetting.  I think we'd need to hook them up to a polygraph and ask a series of questions to vet for views incompatible with American values.  For example,1.	If someone converts from Islam to another religion, should they be punished? How so?2.	Should it be legal to insult the Prophet Muhammad?3.	Should Islamic Law (Shari’a) be the law of the land?4.	Is suicide bombing justified in the defense of Islam?5.	Does the Jewish State of Israel have a right to exist?6.	Should a woman should have the right not to wear the veil, divorce and inheritance?7.	Must a woman obey her husband? Can he beat her if she does not?8.	If a woman dishonors her family, for example by having sex out of wedlock, what should happen to her?9.	Should homosexuality be legal? What should be one to homosexuals?Views incompatible with American values would suggest that the migrant could not assimilate and would not be a good fit for America.</comment>

<comment>Sounds reasonable to me.</comment>

<comment>Because the Obama administration is so supportive of the Muslim Brotherhood, any reference to Islamism, Jihad, etc has been stripped from government procedures, at the instruction of Muslim Brotherhood members working for Homeland Security.So the questions we should be asking are exactly those questions that government workers are not allowed to ask.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, you are right.</comment>

<comment>Obama is too busy bombing jihadists to say the words "radical Islam."</comment>

<comment>7 bombing sorties per day isn't inconveniencing them too badly. And they are quite safe in the cities due to rules of engagement.Even their oil facilities are safe due to concern for environmental damage.</comment>

<comment>"Even their oil facilities are safe due to concern for environmental damage."Not since the Russians starting bombing, they aren't.Not that the Russians are really going to fight ISIS for us. But Putin couldn't resist the opportunity to show the Middle East that Russia is a country with a serious leader whose support is worth having.</comment>

<comment>At least he warned them ahead of time!</comment>

<comment>Trump's assumptions may be correct, have it in mind that the first requirement to becoming a republican is to be stupid.One is brought to remember netanyahu's rhetorics about palestinians which won him the election, there aren't much difference between israelis and republicans.</comment>

<comment>That's true. But economics is also relative. They can see or at least sense that minorities are advancing while they are mostly stagnating. That this is because minorities are starting  at a much lower point doesn't change the sensation of relative immobility. Or the underlying actual immobility. These are the things we need to address as a society. Economic security is vital to a functioning polity.</comment>

<comment>Hey bae, I think you're better than calling them PWT.I think they're understanding that the sense of privilege whiteness gives them is less useful than before, especially as wealthy whites leave them behind.Notice the raising white death rate and how demographically, these victims resemble Trump supporters. I think Trump might be the beginning of a loud, New, more open, racist and bigoted GOP unless the GOP can get it's stuff together.</comment>

<comment>The problem is that those who cheer Trump's suggestion are failing to distinguish between banning the entry of people from problematic countries, which would be legally defensible and not unprecedented in American history, if somewhat ungenerous, and imposing an actual religious test for entry into the United States. That would be unconstitutional, un-American, and more than a little police state.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>A religious test is not necessary. Trump, his supporters and anyone who cares about America would and should be satisfied with an improved nationality test - and nationality quotas have been law since the beginning of American immigration law.</comment>

<comment>Why should we be satisfied by policy that takes us 60 years in the past if we're being honest?How could Trump even get this done if he were to become President?</comment>

<comment>Not all policy change is for the good.Go talk to the formerly middle class people whose share of the pie has been eaten by the one-percenters.</comment>

<comment>Then everyone needs to push back and explain this is what they advocate. </comment>

<comment>Trump is not a lawyer ( thank God). The legal niceties can be worked out later.BTW, I salute your military service and you are no coward for sure.  But you seem to lack the intellectual courage, on this topic, to admit that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with American values.It is uncomfortable, since you have Muslim friends, and respect them and all that - but you need to take an honest look at this.</comment>

<comment>It is not incompatible. The version which accepts no law but sharia, and a rather narrow view of sharia is incompatible, of course. But I've talked to Muslims who are more than content to carry their sharia in their hearts, same as the rest of us do our religious precepts in an government born of the Enlightenment's great compromise, and who not incidentally reject the insanely harsh versions pushed by ISIS. And Saudi Arabia. You want to talk about incompatible with American values.</comment>

<comment>"... But I've talked to Muslims who are more than content to carry their sharia in their hearts...".They are lying to you: taqqiya.  Opinion polls show the opposite.Your friends -  if they take Islam seriously and are not secular - must support attacks on cartoonists : Charlie Hebdo, Mollie Norris, the Danish newspapers, Rushdie, etc.They will not say it to your face - but privately - if they are not secular, then they support it.You are deluding yourself.</comment>

<comment>You some kind of psychic? I mean, I guess I'm not either. Maybe they were all lying to me, and their generosity and endless cups of tea were a front. It's not impossible. Just unlikely.</comment>

<comment>It's not unlikely. You are merely unwilling to examine the contradictions in all of your assumptions.</comment>

<comment>Not just a mind reader a mind reader of a billion human beings all at once!</comment>

<comment>This buzzword gets annoying. There's no religious test, and even if there is? It's codified in our immigration laws.</comment>

<comment>The "buzzword" comes directly from the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>It's codified in our immigration procedures. Please stop whining.</comment>

<comment>Trump is proposing banning Muslims. Islam is a faith, not a nationality. Not everyone in Syria is Muslim. And most Muslims are not even from the Middle East, let alone its conflict zones. So we are talking about a religious test to entry.</comment>

<comment>You need to deal with the points that I made in my post - and not keep hiding behind the specific words that Trump happened to use.You know that the real issue is not the religious test.</comment>

<comment>They love them some buzzwords.Religious test.That's not America, bro.It's just childish.As if they have some idea of what America is.Is America the country that banned immigration for forty years? Specifically screening for anarchists from Europe?Is America the country who had a Klansmen lawyer on the SCOTUS? Who upheld FDR's internment camps during war time?It's idiocy, rhetoric, and cheap buzzwords. Trump is going to be even more popular after this. Especially given the fact that the media is hammering him, and people love him. "Temporary immigration freeze until we figure our country out."But they're losing their damn minds.</comment>

<comment>It is for me. But I'm a bit of a Constitution nerd.</comment>

<comment>It's a bogus issue, and you know it. Legally, it cannot happen ( unfortunately).So why do you latch on to this fake issue as a way of avoiding dealing with the problem on a nationality basis?</comment>

<comment>You can't be a Constitutional nerd and think that there is any constitutional limitation on Congress's authority to bar entry to the US of anyone for either god, bad or no reason.  To my knowledge, the Supreme Court has never found any immigration bill unconstitutional.Over the years, Congress has barred whole classes of people based on race, health, national origin and their political opinions.  Religion would be a first since 1789 but in colonial times, Catholics were quite unwelcome in New England.</comment>

<comment>Until the Constitution came  along and they could no longer do anything judicially about the Catholics.</comment>

<comment>96.6% of refugees we accept are Muslims. So no, it's not a religious test, because if it is, it's against Christians.</comment>

<comment>"Donald Trump is betting that his supporters are xenophobic bigots. . . . [A]fter Monday, the conclusion is hard to escape."That conclusion was hard to escape after June.</comment>

<comment>But at least Hillary's wife is out prostituting off her religion! Thanks, Huma!</comment>

<comment>This really seems to be pointing to Trump actually wanting 'out' of the election process. He keeps doing things that literally guarantee he can't win the election. He has moved at least 10% of centrists onto the Democrat side in 2016. Hillary will win the popular vote by 8-10 million.... No way there is an electoral path that works with those numbers....Most likely scenarios now are:1) Trump drops out after a few primaries.2) Trump goes all the way to the convention with a solid 28-30% of delegates and loses to Rubio in the 3rd or 4th ballot.</comment>

<comment>He'll lose to Cruz at this rate.</comment>

<comment>"Lots of GOP voters get furious when liberals declare or imply that conservatives are racist. They feel that label is wielded cynically as a cudgel for ideological gain.If an MSNBC host had said three days ago that conservatives secretly want to ban all Muslims from America, right-wing commentators would’ve erupted in outrage."You mean the people that get paid on Fox news? Because no one cares about them.Savage, Rush, Mark Levin, and Mark Stein? They'd all be so damn proud of MSNBC if they said that.</comment>

<comment>Progressives are cowards who do not have the guts to admit that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with American values.</comment>

<comment>Go back 50 years people said the same thing about Catholics</comment>

<comment>B*llsh*t. Catholics were not handing out and carrying  out death sentences against American cartoonists.</comment>

<comment>They sort of muffed it in africa with the whole birth control thing.</comment>

<comment>The Klan considered them as much a threat as black peopleas late as the 60s JFK had to plead with people that he wouldn't be taking orders directly from the pope if elected president.</comment>

<comment>Yes - 50 years ago.And - there was no Catholic doctrine of jihad.Maybe there was a story of Vatican-trained pilots performing kamikaze missions on the Empire State building that I missed?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure back in the day they used Guy Fawkes and the IRA as an excuse</comment>

<comment>Interesting. Crazy, but interesting.</comment>

<comment>No, Trump assumes that the majority of ALL voters are "silent" bigots.</comment>

<comment>It's a double standard. Every Muslim country protects Islamic values, and are praised by progressives.Any American who tries to protect American values against Islamic attack gets called a "bigot" by progressives.</comment>

<comment>That is doubtless true.Had a nice conversation with a former liberal who converted once he saw that his side wouldn't call out Muslims for their severely retrograde policies against women because it was too much fun to gang up with them against U.S. conservatives (there is actually an unholy alliance in Europe of the progressives and the Islamists).</comment>

<comment>If conservatives were smart, they would court the socially conservative Muslim vote.I see no reason not to put refugees in Alabama, they can go and hate gays with the locals. COEXIST.</comment>

<comment>They're less than 1% of all voters. Why bother being nice to them when it will alienate your base? Let liberals make an alliance with an illiberal minority.</comment>

<comment>Many blacks are so-cons as well, but, they stick to Democrats no matter what (even though they've gone backward economically in the Obama economy).</comment>

<comment>Many people in general are actually conservative, thrifty, libertarian even, but they stick to Democrats because no matter what the Republicans want to blame everyone but themselves, get away with consistently incompetent, not to mention lazy governance, often with tone deaf misogynistic, homo and ethnophobic and racist commentary, all the while protesting with a false equivalence they never ever recognize, not to mention a brand of penny wise pound foolish anti science, pro gun running, corporate and financial industry welfare, and trade, wage, and tax policies determined to fossilize an ever growing historic wealth inequality no matter what.  But they do like Jesus. The resist not evil, and render unto Caesar parts, the camel through the eye of the needle part, best of all.  We know them by their fruits.</comment>

<comment>Have you ever said such hateful things about people who crash planes into buildings or set pipe bombs (that didn't go off thankfully) for first responders, having already shot around 30 innocents?What was the REAL problem on 9-11 - the 3,000 dead?  Or the (non-existent) backlash against U.S. Muslims because, hey, the dead were probably "little Eichmanns" who got what was coming to them?Have you ever called out Islamic culture - and the way they treat women - with the same contempt you have for American Christians?</comment>

<comment>Not sure we are down for FGM, honor killings, and pouring acid on school girls.</comment>

<comment>That's how it used to be. Bush got 80% of the American Muslim vote in 2000.</comment>

<comment>Every Muslim country is praised by progressives. Really?</comment>

<comment>That is your doctrine. Multiculturalism. Progressive dogma says that all cultures are equally valid, except Western culture which is evil and imperialist.</comment>

<comment>Is it?Got a citation for that?</comment>

<comment>Simple-minded and short-sighted is the issue; not political correctness.  There are 29 Million Muslims in the US.  We do not have the capacity to inter them all.  There are 1.6 Billion (with a B) Muslims in the world.  Aside from a nuclear option, how would you win the Trump Crusades?</comment>

<comment>Not a Trump fan.  At best, he'll run 3rd Party and hand the election to Hillary, who could win with 45% of the vote.But - Conor is missing the important context here - there ARE REASONS that Trump's message is resonating with working class whites (his poll numbers are 3x with non-college educated Rs than with college educated Rs).The government and the economy have left them behind, and there's no one speaking for them.  The President thinks they are bitter clingers.Exhibit A was Obama's prime time speech Sunday night where - based on word count - he spoke more about the dangers of the (so far non-existent) backlash against Muslims than he did about the government, you know, actually doing its job with respect to public safety.  We have the biggest jihadi killing since 9-11 with guns bought LEGALLY in a tightly-regulated state, and Obama, the NYT, etc. want to talk about...more gun control.</comment>

<comment>I have two Masters degrees. I am not uneducated. I support Trump.</comment>

<comment>What does this say about the value of higher education in this country?</comment>

<comment>Then you are smart enough to know that the plural of anecdote is not data :).My wife is to the right of Genghis Khan, but she is also a fierce (common sense)  environmentalist.  I think the EPA is sometimes the spawn of Satan, but it doesn't mean I want to have a bonfire on the Cuyahoga.People are a mess.</comment>

<comment>I am also an environmentalist. I am very concerned about habitat destruction and overpopulation.If progressives actually cared about the environment - they should acknowledge that open borders is counterproductive to saving the environment.Keeping the Mexican border open, for example, enables the Mexican government from taking any responsibility for population, pollution, worker safety and many other issues that progressives are supposed to care about.This book, by liberal professor Philip Cafaro, explains it :http://www.amazon.com/How-Many...</comment>

<comment>Still waiting for a single person to tell me what "open borders" are</comment>

<comment>They're bad, we know that much!</comment>

<comment>sure sounds bad whatever they are!someone ought to tell the 21 thousand border patrol guards!</comment>

<comment>Nobody ever said that educated people couldn't love being pandered to by bigoted demagogues.</comment>

<comment>There are better ways to lower gun violence like the CEASEFIRE program:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wik...Obama's bad ideas on guns are smothering good ideas. His list idea is only going to promote more profiling of Arabs and Muslims. It also isn't pragmatic in today's violent government.We also need to fix the stupid judicial/police system. Most shootings are done by a handful of people, despite the location, Southside Chicago's murders are done by only 1,000 men who are generally repeat offenders. Get the police to actually solve murders in poor areas, their unsolved rate is higher, making punishment for murder low. Bad policing and high crime are two sides of the same coin.</comment>

<comment>The context is the non stop Republican propaganda about half of America not being really American, and it has been going on for some time now.  The Republican party seems to believe if we just live in a gated community, prohibit abortion, or any form of birth control, actually any discussion whatsoever about birth control, and keep providing corporate welfare, farm subsidies for their Republican representatives, accept governance so dysfunctional they have a major trauma every time they are asked to pay the bills, have no constructive proposals on how to deal with health care, what to do about climate change, what to do with millions of people working and contributing to the American economy who have fled Mexico and Central America as a result of our disastrous foreign, trade, and drug policies, not to mention being the source of arming cartels, because Second Amendment fanaticism, or Middle East policy, except to complain about the President and for godsakes some form of sensible arms regulations so insistently that from top to bottom from JJMac to Spudwhisperer, one and all mouth the same musheaded kind of critique of the President that enables Trump and Cruz, the whole nine yards to not only blather on, but for them to lather up and foam with Limbaugh-like dittoheadedness.The Democrats among the political class may not be delivering in a way that suits you and yours, but you and yours are an absolute on going disaster reality tv show that you never, ever, will take one bit of responsibility for.  Pointing the finger at the other, just look in the mirror with that pose once in a while.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I know E - another tiresome screed - Dems get a pass because Republicans are really really bad.How then to explain then NC's recovery under McCrory, a state every right-thinking progressive assured me was a hellhole once the Rs took over?According to the latest federal statistics, North Carolina’s economy is surging and has become one of the nation’s pacesetters. This is not a political claim. It is simply a fact. If not for the partisan implications, it might well be front-page, top-of-the-broadcast news.Over the 12-month period ending in August (the most recent federal data available at this writing), employment in North Carolina rose by 2.6 percent. That’s the 10th-highest rate of job growth in the United States, and about 25 percent faster than both the national and regional averages. In the Southeast, only Florida (No. 3 in the nation) and South Carolina (7th) are adding jobs at a higher rate.http://www.gastongazette.com/a...</comment>

<comment>Tiresome to hear the truth and your own so called Christian and American principles thrown in your face.  It is always the other for you--American blacks protesting the violence of institutionalized police brutality, poor people on food stamps while you dine in fancy hotels, Muslims with a broad brush while you never ever take the time to condemn American Christian missionaries in Uganda, perhaps you work with some of these folks, and so on.  Yes I am sure you find me tiresome: I find you an extremely ignorant hypocrite of the first order. And no state turnaround has occurred like that in CA when a Dem became governor and instead of the old gerrymandered need for a super majority all it took was a plain majority to get a budget enacted. What, by the way, is the matter with Kansas?  Bible spouting, financial industry, tnn lemming, yes I am sure you find me tiresome.http://www.bizjournals.com/tri...Lukewarm=amazing in JJspeak.

<comment>He yelled on CNN and then MSNBC this morning and both led the next hour with their fabulous coverage. If he didn't exist they'd have to create him. Other candidates complain he gets too much coverage which is more of an admission that they don't know how the game is played.</comment>

<comment>The fact that he is so popular among some Republicans proves his theory that they are racist and xenophobic.</comment>

<comment>Trump sees the country as it is. Not as others wish it could be. He is basically running a campaign of common sense against the elites of both parties.</comment>

<comment>He panders to the right better than his competition. If he wins the nomination he'll go back to being a Democrat and people like yourself will get to be angry all over again.</comment>

<comment>I love Trump, but I won't vote for him. I have too much money to be angry about anything. Liberals always confuse anger and fear and common sense.</comment>

<comment>People who say they have a lot of money usually don't and even when they do it never stops them from hating. The owner of Home Depot gives money to fundamentalists because he's full of hatred.</comment>

<comment>People who act they know everything, usually don't. </comment>

<comment>I agree.</comment>

<comment>Republicans are all about anger and fear. They intend to keep the country angry and afraid. It's their one true mission in life in hopes it will gain them back the White House. The people have far more common sense than to fall for it.</comment>

<comment>You can't really walk back the things he's said.  He's made his bed with the Hispanic vote, and there's not getting them back.  He's proposed banning all Muslims from entering the country, for jebus' sake.  You can't shift that in the general election.</comment>

<comment>Of course he will, he does it in every interview, but that doesn't mean he'll win the general election.</comment>

<comment>Running a campaign on common sense!  Are you serious? Trump doesn't know the meaning of commons sense in this situation! He is talking hateful and simplistic nonsense and sadly his supporters lap it up which doesn't paint them in a good light. Trump supporters are also are an embarrassment to the country by supporting someone who is so out of control and taking the country down a dark dangerous road.</comment>

<comment>What a lying bunch of hypocrites. The audacity of a party that started an illegal war which murdered hundreds of thousands of innocent women and children talking about integrity.Sickening.</comment>

<comment>What Donald Trump is proposing is a complete assault on the constitution. He is proposing that the US effectively become a theocracy in permanent war with Islam.Way to equivocate Conor F. Just can't help getting in a dig at Hillary Clinton even as Donald Trump has moved past pandering and into the realm of taking away civil liberties and destroying our way of life in the name of racism, xenophobia and religious intolerance. Proof that Libertarians are frauds and failures who've sacrificed their principles and even their basic human dignity because they're afraid to divorce the Republican Party.</comment>

<comment>Religious litmus tests are unconstitutional. They violate the first line of the first amendment to the constitution. Republicans are in fact proposing that we destroy the foundation of our free society. In effect, republicans want to impose THEIR Sharia Law on Americans.Donald Trump and his cowardly supporters (and Ted Cruz who's actually worse) need to move to a place that shares their values - like Iran - and get the f@#k out of MY country.</comment>

<comment>Having a government that uses religious tests for immigration does affect citizens though. It means the government has announced a religious preference, something which it cannot do. It means Americans are represented on the world stage as having an explicit religious preference, something many do not want. It means there is precedent for other religious based exclusions: Hindus, Catholics, Jews, Orthodox, Anglicans, you name it. That means citizens are separated from their co-religionists and it can inhibit the practice of their faith. It means people in business in those religions cannot come here to make deals, affecting citizens' ability to make money and participate in commerce.And at any rate, a Trump spokesman claimed it would apply to Muslim citizens living abroad, so they would obviously be affected too. </comment>

<comment>Trump proposed no entry to American Muslims who live abroad.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a temper tantrum in a teapot. The level of discourse of his supporters reminds me of myself in high school, except they're in their 40s and 50s. He seems to have decided/realized that he's not going to be America's President so he's going down swinging as their Great White Hope. It's probably another business venture.I don't have the time or the stomach to go through all the old comments, but it would be funny to watch his supposed base of support get winnowed away. Latinos love him! Well, legal Latinos love him. Blacks are gonna vote for him because they're tired of Mexicans taking their jobs! Rank-and-file Dems will defect because they're sick of the party coddling the blacks! And on straight down to the bottom of the barrel.</comment>

<comment>Trump's saving grace is that he is too stupid to do what he had the potential to do.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. I'm convinced that a good portion of his supporters have never actually heard the man speak. They just like what they see in the press releases. He manages to be simultaneously vague and dimwitted in his delivery, not to mention the nature of what he's saying. </comment>

<comment>Actually, I think the opposite: Trump's speaking style is critical to his success, saying that as someone who has spent a lot of time listening to his speeches. I don't think he could get away with his half brained proposals if he weren't so skilled in delivering to the Great Unwashed.</comment>

<comment>Well then it takes a special kind of person to find his delivery appealing. He says things along the lines of "when I get in office things are gonna be turned around so fast it'll make your head spin," or "we'll seal the border so good you're not gonna believe it," or "these other guys are losers. Nobody wants them." Bear in mind, of course, that these aren't quite direct quotes. But they very easily could be. Such a lowest-common-denominator way of talking makes the mind reel. But you're right. It apparently appeals to enough people to keep him in the headlines. H.L. Mencken would have a field day.</comment>

<comment>I will say that Trump probably would be a lot less appealing if he didn't make such a stark contrast to our ruling bicoastal elite. It's only possible because they have largely failed the people over the last 15 years and yet still demand that we kiss the ass of their Weltanschaunng. Trump is in no small part a backlash against what politics has become.You'd be surprised how many Trumpistas will say in private that the man is a jackass, but seeing Karl Rove and the Washington Post squirm is worth supporting him.</comment>

<comment>Does the bicoastal elite still rule though? I feel like this a bit on the order of Protestants railing against the Pope; the battle is largely over. I personally despise the whole Washington "consensus" crowd, to be sure. But to talk of an "East Coast elite" (with California added in once they started voting Democratic in the 90s) seems a bit anachronistic. Circa 1965, really.So much has happened in the favor of the so-called Heartland in the last several decades. Witness Southern president after Southern president, Nixon's Silent Majority, the Reagan Revolution, the only recently diminished Evangelical factor, Gingrich in the 90s, and the Bush years in general. I'm not sympathetic to the coastal liberals, but I'm not looking for a champion to go combat them either. It's hardly necessary anymore.</comment>

<comment>I think so, though "bicoastal" probably isn't the most accurate word in the world. Our elite (corporate, media, and political) is more heterogeneous in ethnic background and location than ever. More meritocratic than ever, too, to be fair, and more globalized than ever. But more relatively homogeneous than ever in thought and in *Weltanschaunng*, and that's taking in both the Republican and Democrat sections (and there exist both, hence the Bushes. There are differences between them, but they are getting less sharp, to be honest) of them. That's dangerous.</comment>

<comment>Trumpettes are the Seventh Day Adventists of Stupid.</comment>

<comment>The GOP needs to stop Trump, and stop him now. He is Perot with the rhetoric of Wallace. If they don't, it's going to be 1992 all over again on steroids electorally, in spite of the fact that the wife Clinton is far less strong of a candidate than the husband Clinton. Too bad that this would actually require addressing the causes behind his rise among working and lower middle class whites.Anyway, are most GOP base voters bigots? My answer is "yes and no"(part of it depends on who you are. I don't think many progressive journalists realize that they are still a minority, no matter how diverse the US is getting), and would take multiple paragraphs to explain. But I don't think that's the right question to ask so much as what is the Pavlovian behavior. Because if progressives call them bigots, they'll respond by doubling down. Right or wrong(and I'd argue again that there is a kernel of truth to both), they largely believe that charges of racism or bigotry are politically motivated from the left.</comment>

<comment>You'll care when he shifts the parameters of the debate, as he has done with Mexicans.Trump's policies are never going to succeed. I doubt he believes that himself. But he's getting the bien-pensants to freak out, and he reaps the political benefit from that. The Donald knows what he is doing in a limited sense.</comment>

<comment>The question is are Republican the bigots Trump thinks they are or are they the bigots Ted Cruz thinks they are.</comment>

<comment>The only people who benefit from Trump policies are bigots across the world. Trump supporters and ISIS, who have a lot in common.No one else wins this attempt at a "clash of civilizations".</comment>

<comment>Do Trumpistas regularly behead people and burn captured pilots alive?</comment>

<comment>No, they just beat BLM protesters and Hispanic men they dislike.They're a loud, vocal and ultimately powerless minority driven by hate and greed. Incapable of reasoning with politically who follow a guy who only cares about himself.Lashing out at powerful American/Saudi elites who they see as traitors but don't have any answers themselves and feel the only way to maximize their power is to promote fear and ignorance against groups they don't like (Yzaidis, Hispanics, Shi'tes, Muslims as whole, Blacks, Kurds).ISIS is fat more violent, but their logic is the same and both end up at an authoritarian but crumbling police state where they still wouldn't have what they wanted.</comment>

<comment>And seethe at their powerlessness in the modern world.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump with his hate filled rhetoric toward Muslims is the biggest recruiter for ISIS. He either doesn't understand that or he just couldn't care less! He's going totally against American values with his latest nonsensical unconstitutional idea of banning ALL Muslims from coming here. This man is a buffoon and certainly one that has no place in the White House. He may well win the GOP nomination which will put an end to the Republican Party but they have no one to blame but themselves. Adored by them all by being the master of the birther movement against President Obama and now they are stuck with this joke of a man.</comment>

<comment>You're very silly.The jihad began in 1990 when GHW Bush began stationing US military formations in Saudi Arabia,  Since then, every US administration has been stationing more and more non-muslims in SA. In addition, since 1996, the US has been recklessly bombing and invading muslim countries.  That has been al Qaeda's and ISIS's biggest recruiter.There is nothing unconstitutional about barring immigrants based upon their sex, race, nationality or religion.  The Constitution only operates on those Congress choses to allow to immigrate to the US.The White House been the home of many buffoons in the past, one more won't make any difference.Those of us who support Trump know perfectly well we are aiming at destroying the GOP controlled by the Chamber of Commerce and Wall Street.BTW, who is a bigger joke at the moment than Obama?</comment>

<comment>I'm silly! You must be joking.  Those who are voting for Trump are the silly ones here. Sad to say that those who will or who are thinking of voting for him cannot have the best interests of the country at heart if they are prepared to let this ignorant man anywhere near the White House.</comment>

<comment>#Make America Hate Again#trump 2016The low info voters to whom trump appeals (see comments from spudwisper and johnjmac et al) may be enough to win him the republican nomination, but not the election. trump has always known this. His ultimate goal is that these same critters will be buying the trash he markets for years to come.  He has taken palin's strategy to another level by using the US Presidential nomination process as a marketing tool.  One might feel sorry about the predicament of honest conservatives, but they've done everything to bring this on themselves.</comment>

<comment>Why Japan doesn't have a single problem with muslims???http://toprightnews.com/japan-...</comment>

<comment>Trump thinks that he can run the country like he is running a business or Corporate America.He has the mindset that human beings are like software packages. They can be deployed, downgrade, upgraded, enhanced, postponed, put on hold, put in a pending state, developed, and programmed.Human beings deserves respect.We do not support VIOLENCE of any kind or on any level.We do not support Trump or ANY presidential candidate, Republican, or Democrat openly attacking Blacks/African Americans, Mexicans, Hispanics, Latinos, Muslims, Disabled people, Poor, Homeless, Middle Class or Religious Freedom.We don't not support any presidential candidate that is Pro-war, Pro-violence, Pro-bombs, Pro-guns. When our children, family members, friends, and neighbors are being destroyed by gun violence on our streets and in our communities.</comment>

<comment>Where was the "Moderate" Muslim fury when 20 Christians were beheaded on a beach in Egypt? Or the Moderate Muslim fury when the ISIS had rounded up the Yazidis like cattle on a mountaintop? Where was the Muslim fury when the UK protected the Human Rights of Hate Imams in the UK? Where was the Muslim fury after the Paris attacks? Where was the Muslim fury after the California attack.Yet Trump says the US should freeze immigration until the problems are resolved and the "Moderate" Muslim fury comes full force. Interesting.</comment>

<comment>Every country should learn from Japan.http://toprightnews.com/japan-...</comment>

<comment>He certainly has proof that no less than 30% of the GOP base are frothing bigots who are eager to lap up whatever bile he can spew.  It remains to be seen whether that additional 21% is willing to come along.</comment>

<comment>"Heil Donald Trump - THE ULTIMATE SAVIOR. Make America White Again!"- Andrew Anglin, publisher of the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer</comment>

<comment>Hey Bored - the President on Sunday night called the shooting in San Bernardino an act of terrorism.  The FBI confirmed that the couple had been radicalized for "some time," and that their plan to set off pipe bombs to kill the First Responders miraculously failed.Why didn't he listen to you when you suresuresure within 24 hours it was "workplace violence?"Did I miss where you retracted your obvious idiocy?</comment>

<comment>The shooting occurred in the shooters workplace. Should we just ignore that fact?</comment>

<comment>Then - 9-11 was also workplace violence amiright because people, like, worked in the World Trade Center and everything!The Paris shooting venues included a soccer stadium, a restaurant and a theater.  Is that "entertainment violence?"</comment>

<comment>The 911 hijackers worked at the towers they flew the planes into? I don't get your logic here.</comment>

<comment>ok, muslims + terrorist action = what is it called? by your liberal logic?</comment>

<comment>Workplace terror? We've seen a lot of that over the years. Pretty tough to predict and stop.</comment>

<comment>Beside it happended at a workplace, there are a lot of other factors that can indicate otherwise, same style of the Paris terrorits, isis praises the couple... use your brain</comment>

<comment>ISIS said that they weren't members and did not claim responsibility for the attack. What's with that?</comment>

<comment>Just to be clear - the Ft. Hood and San Bernardino shootings were acts of Islamic terror that just happened to occur in the workplace.It's a signal of jihadi depravity that they murder their co-workers - in the case of San Bernardino - their co-workers had recently hosted a baby shower for the lovely couple.</comment>

<comment>Not every piece of violence committed by Muslims is terror.Terror requires a political component this shooting really doesn't have much of.</comment>

<comment>You know that - how?They clearly had outside financial support.  </comment>

<comment>re depravity and murder People murder family members every day so co workers is not more depraved than average.</comment>

<comment>You are looking for logic where there is none.</comment>

<comment>Every action has logic. You just have to look hard for it sometimes.</comment>

<comment>I was referring to the logic you were looking for in the comment you were responding to, not the "logic" behind some nut case shooting up his co-workers.</comment>

<comment>When someone makes the conscious choice to slaughter co-workers it is workplace violence no matter what guise they try to put on it. Real terrorists do not kill friends and acquaintances, crazy people do. This just proves that Da'esh is nothing but a cult seeking power and wealth. It is lead by a charismatic man who uses religion to inspire fear and hate among his followers. Oh, I just described TRUMPy!</comment>

<comment>u suks like obama does</comment>

<comment>You prove why a reality TV caricature of a pandering GOP candidate is leading the GOP circus parade.</comment>

<comment>You were doing fine until you're stupid false equivalence at the end.Let's assume Trump is as bad as you say is and should be rightly reviled  his retrograde views. Should we not also revile the black lives matter movement for their clearly hateful views towards white people?  Should we not call out the Islamic world for their incredibly poor treatment of half of the population?Your side will have more credibility when you take the blinders off</comment>

<comment>First of all, the "false equivalence" was a joke, but then we know regressives have no sense of humor when it comes to their heroes.I know several people involved in the Black Lives Matter movement and it has nothing to do with hating white people. Many of them happen to be white. It has to do with cops slaughtering black men and children. How many videos of cops pumping 16 bullets into someone do you need to see before YOU take your blinders off and see there is a problem?We do call out the muslim world for their discrimination against women, and there are many progressive muslims who do as well.The binders are on the right. It is they who have put a reality TV caricature of a pandering GOP politician at the head of the GOP circus parade.</comment>

<comment>So - therefore we know that you make stupid comments with no information, and when obvious contradictory information comes to light, you turtle.You are part of the problem.</comment>

<comment>You're such a moron. You're too old for those tired talking points.</comment>

<comment>Are you still willing to vote for Trump if he gets the nomination?</comment>

<comment>I'm guessing majority bigots, but that's not a slam dunk for Trump because the bigot vote has plenty of options this year.</comment>

<comment>Conor Friedorsdoff is a xenophobic. Donald Trump is the ONLY politician BRAVE enough to face the reality. Discriminate people based on color of skin is xenophobia. We are discriminating Muslims based on terror history world wide.How many crimes of indiscriminate bombing, shooting and killings of tourists and the public should be done before we target criminals and ban them???True that not all Muslims are terrorists. BUT ALL Muslims obey the Quran and prayed on these doctrines 5x per day daily since childhood. These are orders from the Quran based on their prophet and Allah:"Allah is the greatest of the deceivers." - Qur'an 3:54The Messenger of Allah said: “I have been commanded to fight againstpeople till they testify that there is no god but Allah, that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah”. - Muslim (1:33)"Fight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, even if they are ofthe People of the Book, until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued." - Qur’an (9:29)Allah loves those who fight in his way."- Qur’an (61:4)"Those who believe fight in the cause of Allah” Qur’an (4:76)"Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward." - Qur’an (4:74)"Fighting is prescribed for you, and ye dislike it. But it is possible that ye dislike a thing which is good for you, and that ye love a thing which is bad for you. But Allah knoweth, and ye know not." Quran (2:216)"Not equal are those believers who sit at home and receive no hurt, andthose who strive and fight in the cause of Allah with their goods and their persons. Allah hath granted a grade higher to those who strive and fight with their goods and persons than to those who sit at home. Unto all in Faith Hath Allah promised good: But those who strive and fight Hath He distinguished above those who sit at home by a special reward" - Quran (4:95)"The holy war is a religious duty, because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force"- Ibn Khaldun Allah’s apostle said, "I have been made victorious with terror."-Bukhara (52:220)"Every Muslim should be a terrorist."- Dr. Zakir Naik, Islamic speaker "Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers.” Qu'ran (3:151)"Strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them" - Qu'ran (8:12)“Kill the disbelievers wherever you find them.”- Quran (9:5)"Killing Unbelievers is a small matter to us."- Tabari 9:69“Allah said, ‘A prophet must slaughter before collecting captives. A slaughtered enemy is driven from the land. Muhammad, you craved the desires of this world, its goods and the ransom captives would bring.But Allah desires killing them to  anifest the religion.” - Ibn  Ishaq/Hisham 484</comment>

<comment>One thing I'll take as a good sign:  Weeks ago there would've been dozens of Trump defenders here.  Now we're down to a handful and they're not even trying to cover up being bigoted hacks anymore</comment>

<comment>It's early, my friend.  It's early.</comment>

<comment>It is a small handful who's working awfully hard to spin Trumps terrible agenda. And, they usually resort to extreme trolling or spamming when they get called out.</comment>

<comment>YES BUZZWORDS.Bigot= Someone who wants to make America safe</comment>

<comment>If immigrant Catholics at the turn of the last century had slaughtered over 2,000 Americans, you can bet your a$$ the door would have been closed to them as well.</comment>

<comment>Revised headline: "Donald Trump Correctly Assumes That a Majority of Republican Voters Are Bigots"</comment>

<comment>Does the Trump campaign even realize that there's a general election after the primary?</comment>

<comment>Does he even care?At this point his brand is so trashed Trumps next business is going to be right wing radio or a Palin book tour.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't take a majority of bigots to get the nomination. It takes a committed core of bigots and a enough of the rest who are willing to go along with that coalition. So far Republican candidates are matching Trump one step back, rather than taking a position against.Recent news reports about advice given to candidates by Republican party strategists is to shadow Trump in his appeals in a less abrasive manner, with out inviting the bigots to choose someone else.CF has done his part, with his triangulated attacks on 'political correctness'-- aka opposition to tolerance for bigoted speech-- as a defence of free speech without regard for consequences. Now he has Trump to disavow.As a side note, the GOP base has grown on the basis of bigotry since the 1960 election.  Here is the evidence:http://www.salon.com/2015/12/0...And for contemporary evidence on anti-Muslim sentiment:http://www.slate.com/articles/...</comment>

<comment>"I think this whole notion that somehow we can just say no more Muslims, just ban a whole religion, goes against everything we stand for and believe in. I mean, religious freedom has been a very important part of our history and where we came from..."=======When the most evil figure of the previous decade is the sensible voice of reason refuting a statement, you know that Donald has gone way too far.</comment>

<comment>It's a natural extension of the extremism from both parties:On the one hand, we have people who tell us we're bigots unless we support the government forcing Christian bakers to bake cakes for same-sex weddings.On the other hand, we have people who are telling us we have to give up our rights because the threat from radical Islam is so great that we have to spend billions of dollars to invade and remake their countries.In such an environment, is it any surprise that the sanctimony from both sides in response to Trump's anti-Muslim bigotry falls flat?</comment>

<comment>Demanding equal protection under law for gay people is the same as banning all Muslims from the nation?!?! Wow! That's some reasoning there!</comment>

<comment>The government shall not infringe on a religion's right to discriminate in the name of it's supreme being.</comment>

<comment>That is some heroic false equivalence.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump asks for a freeze on immigration, and people lose their minds. We've done that before.We can do it again. Why are you all so upset?</comment>

<comment>We have done this before. We forced the Japanese citizens into camps during WWII and we've regretted it ever since.</comment>
