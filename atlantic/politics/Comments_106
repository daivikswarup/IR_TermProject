<comment>Woooo! Medical research getting funded! Wooo!</comment>

<comment>Nothing about how the funding will serve the public good. Congress is not concerned about accountability at NIh-nor the public good. Less then two years ago Dr Collins indicated efforts at ensuring reproducibility of research is hobbled. So much for accountability at NIH. In 2014 a GAO report found little correlation between nih funding and disease burden. Last year, we found out that over a billion dollars was wasted on the child study. The first decade of the brain- a failure- that didn't stop NIh from a second decade of the brain. There is no pause for thought or critical reflection or concern with accountability at NIH. The Nartional Pain Strategy created by NIH received 6 serious criticisms from the IASp- in addition Dr Terman- who was on the oversight committee said he dodnt know how or when the plan would be implemented. Dr Collins promised in 2000 by the year 2010 all kinds of new treatments would be developed by mapping the genome- in 2010 he admitted it might take another ten years for such.NIH needs to be overhauled-and the American public needs to hold their legislators accountable for the lack of oversight over a careless and non results oriented  ands unaccountable NIH.</comment>

<comment>The NIH needs a 10 year budget with the ability to fund long term projects. I worked in a lab during the NIH boom and bust of 2009-2014. We were forced to spend the grant money in a single year and the result was buying lots of fancy equipment one year with no budget to buy even gloves or petri dishes the next year. Many PhD students start their program with full funding and ended up without the money to finish the project.  No private company would spend 100% of it's investors money in the first year, so why do we require this of the NIH funded labs?</comment>

<comment>Yes. My sister in law, who is now a faculty member at the U of MD School of Nursing, had an opportunity once to take a position at NIH, and turned it down largely for this reason.</comment>

<comment>One possible explanation:  Congress is full of old men who are afraid to die.  It's a bipartisan concern.</comment>

<comment>If there's one thing that's undoubtedly worth spending tax dollars on, it's research, both clinical and basic.</comment>

<comment>The hidden costs associated with NIH-funded research are large and potentially grave.</comment>

<comment>I have the privilege of knowing a woman who has lobbied hard for increased funding for Alzheimer's research for the last 15 years. I am so proud to know her and very grateful that her patience and hard work will be rewarded with this latest increase in NIH's funding.</comment>

<comment>Even some conservatives are coming to their senses, realizing that all the private sector pharma and biotech is good for is cold remedies, hair loss treatments, diet pills, and schlong enlargement elixirs.  Come to find out that NIH is quite useful, after all; in fact, essential.</comment>
