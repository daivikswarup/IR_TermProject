<comment>Can it be?  Paul Ryan no longer a useless gadfly?  A GOP   House willing to spend money to do its job?  Oh, happy, happy day.On the other hand, how disappointing that suddenly not-completely-worthless is good enough.</comment>

<comment>Ryan could just be trying to woo the nation into supporting his run for President.</comment>

<comment>Ryan and his congress decision to go "on the cheap" is not surprising and a dereliction of duty.  Vote for 6 years, but only fund three, and authorize 140 billion less than what is really needed.  They want to show that they really care, but not really.</comment>

<comment>Typical liberal reaction.  You will never be happy with any level of spending.</comment>

<comment>I would be delighted with spending adequate to bring our aging bridges, overpasses, and water mains above a letter grade D.</comment>

<comment>There is always money for war and wasteful defense contractors, but when it comes to domestic investment, every penny has to be counted.</comment>

<comment>Dude, roads are pretty basic.  I can understand arguing over funding for entitlements, but really...it's roads.</comment>

<comment>RIIIGHT. Pave 'em with good intentions and you have the perfect route to hell.</comment>

<comment>Why should Michigan get it all?</comment>

<comment>True enough. Liberals always damn the light, no matter its source. They spent nearly five years since the GOP House takeover whining over infrastructure and when handed the best transportation bill since 2004,[ and one that Reid never pursued or Pelosi when they were running the show ] go immediately to moaning and bellyaching.</comment>

<comment>How much of this bill is pork?</comment>

<comment>All of it not directly aimed in your direction I would guess.</comment>

<comment>One good solution to our roads is if we privatize them and whomever owns certain roads or sections of roads should be in charge of maintaining that road.It worked for Cosmo Kramer.</comment>

<comment>I was one of the interns :)</comment>

<comment>your internship diary indicates you've been... doing laundry, mending chicken wire, and attending high tea with mr. newman???</comment>

<comment>Road and bridges have needed fixing forever. President Obama has called for this for the past few years! The no show Republicans refused to jump onboard with his jobs bill. Money can always be found for the war machine but when it comes for anything that benefits the people as in decent roads and bridges it must be done short term or just a little bit of money here and there. It's ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>While I am no fan of federal spending I support a bill which attempts to repair our deteriorating highway system.  Naturally of course Americans want something for free.The gas tax should be raised by $.25 immediately.  Gas is cheap right now and a quarter per gallon is a pretty easy price to pay by Americans who realize they have to pay for what they get.The conservatives get all bent out of shape over raising taxes but raising it is better than driving our nation into yet more debt.</comment>

<comment>Yet you fail to make your own case when these very Republicans SUPPORT a raise in gas taxes. Indeed, this very rag, the ATLANTIC, immediately dispels this nonsense in a March 2015 article headed:''Gas Taxes Are Going Up In Republican Led States''.That's not all.The Wall Street Journal Jan.09,2015: ''Senate Republicans: Gas Taxes Are On The Table''It should be pointed out that 25% of these taxes go nowhere near transportation or infrastructure. However, you are entitled to your opinion.Not your ''facts''................</comment>

<comment>Good.  Then I do not feel so bad since I support an immediate rise in the gas tax.  And yes, some of it probably does not go to transportation.  That needs to be corrected.</comment>

<comment>And bear in mind, that as with past taxes, even the imposition of such a tax will do nothing except to act as a driver for more debt. [ look at where liberals used the device in their own states. Debt only got worse]. This is due to the fact that these revenues simply were not used to pay down debt. [ unlike Texas, which used its revenues to do just this and thus create a vast budget surplus, using a ''Red State'' fiscal model as comparison ]                   Californias Jerry Brown made the attempt after an increase to 17.7% [ 45 cents on the gallon when state fuel taxes are included ], but made not even a dent in that states new spending which parks its unfunded liabilities in the ''hundreds of billions''. [LA Times, Sacramento Bee Oct.23,2013 ]. Nobody is certain. All agree that it is the worst ever experienced. Here, in petrie-dish experiment, Brown as Democrat governor, must tangle with the free-spending Legislature as Democrat, which owns a veto-proof supermajority. As it now stands, not a single blue state in the nation has control of its spending, despite registering the highest taxes in the nation, as expected, led by states including California, New York, Illinois, and Connecticut.</comment>

<comment>Well, it's better than nothing. But it is annoying that the politicians are going to wait until interest rates go up before they pay for all needed infrastructure repairs. Buy and borrow low, as everyone knows. And then they will probably wait until the bridges are actually collapsing, further adding to the price tag. Tragedy of the commons, Exhibit A.</comment>

<comment>Passing bills and then refusing to pay for them is becoming this Congress' modus operandi, so I can't say that I'm surprised that they passed 6 years of appropriations and only approved of 3 years of payment.That said, it's better than I expected!</comment>

<comment>The US highway in front of our house is in rough shape. It was rebuilt 15 years ago and since, has one coat of chip seal laid down four years ago. Unless the State can fill the cracks and holes, come spring there won't be a road. Even just another chip seal would help this road last another couple of years. But they can't afford even that.Chip seal = $40,000 /m. Rebuild = $1,000,000+ /m.</comment>

<comment>It's close enough to the end of Obama's term that I guess Republicans are ok with spending money to build things in America. Since 2010, any useful spending might have helped Obama's poll numbers, and keeping those down is still the number one Republican priority (well, number two, behind cutting taxes for the rich).</comment>

<comment>Will all go smoothly till someone adds a rider to defund Planned Parenthood...</comment>

<comment>Shovel ready?  Depends on what is shoveled.</comment>

<comment>raise the gas tax. It is really simple. If you drive on the roads a lot, you use a lot of gas, you pay more tax, therefore the roads are paid for by folks who drive the most.If you don't drive a lot, you don't pay the tax. Right now if you don't drive you still pay for roads and the folks who drive are getting a handout from the folks who don't drive. Doesn't that go against republicans ideals?</comment>

<comment>And, a free ride (literally) for the Tesla owners?</comment>

<comment>Americans love handouts that they receive ... they just hate the handouts other people receive.  Isn't our culture great?</comment>

<comment>Yes and no. Most of the damage to roads and bridges come from heavy trucks. Because trucks, however, are the boon and backbone to commerce then they are virtually untouchable. If we wanted to be fair, we would tax trucks much more heavily.Balancing that, however, with cars there is the volume. Cars require all the extra lanes. As costly as it may be to society to have a truck delivery delayed by traffic, it is even more expensive to have all the workers delayed while sitting in a traffic jam.The gasoline tax is just one source of revenue that most see as fair. It isn't. A fair system would charge by the damage done to the roads while paying for the roads out of a general fund.</comment>

<comment>So charge by weight?</comment>

<comment>That's built in to the gas tax, as heavier vehicles require more fuel to travel the same distance.  Just raise the damned gas tax.</comment>

<comment>Except that the amount of damage to roads varies with the fourth power of the weight per vehicle axle. If vehicle A weighs twice as much as vehicle B then Vehicle A does 16 times as much road damage as vehicle B. This only gets covered if Vehicle A burns 16 times as much fuel as vehicle B</comment>

<comment>Since most heavy tractor-trailer combinations weigh around 60,000 lbs and the average car is closer to 3,000 lbs, that is around a 20 fold weight difference. Even empty, they weigh around 30,000 lbs.Roads are expected to flex some. The heavier the weight the more they will flex past the road's carrying capacity. That causes cracks in the road. In the northern two thirds of the nation, water gets into those cracks and then freezes when the temperature drops. That freezing expands the cracks, making them even worse and developing potholes.Cars simply are not damaging paved roads. Trucks are. Raising the gas taxes uniformly won't put the cost on those doing the damage.</comment>

<comment>I am usually in agreement with you,  but would offer here that you seem unaware of the use taxes that the trucking industry pays.   I'm sure you've noticed the weigh stations along your highways.   They exist to heavily tax trucks by the weight that they carry.  HEAVILY tax.And the gas tax needs to be raised to pay for a trillion dollars in infrastructure through low interest bonds,  and it needs to be done right now.   But it won't be done.   We have no responsible Republican leadership.</comment>

<comment>"...lawmakers never seriously considered raising the 18.4 cents-a-gallon gas tax, which hasn’t been touched in more than two decades... and so the search for funding goes on."What a joke.</comment>

<comment>Losers, all of them!  The bill's just horrible, and by the way, Trump is leading in all the polls ... by a lot (except the ones he isn't, which are obviously biased hit jobs).  He's also really, really rich, worth over $10 billion (as long as your math skills lead to believe a number somewhere in the 2 to 4 range is bigger than 10).  When Trump is president, the highways will be terrific and we will keep taxes low and we'll have more health care and the debt will be gone (along with those pesky immigrants that didn't comply with our simple and fair immigration system).  Plus he'll get us some really great deals like this magic carpet cleaner for just 19.95!  Call now and Trump will throw in two more bottles of the cleaning solution that will make all your troubles go away.  That's three bottles of magic carpet cleaner for just 19.95!!  You'll never have to worry about a dirty carpet again, and now you can carry an extra bottle with you in case you want to try to blind someone you think is an illegal immigrant.  Make America great again!</comment>

<comment>Isn't that rug cleaner also delicious as a topping on ice cream?</comment>

<comment>When do you think both houses will poison the bill?</comment>

<comment>The Ex-Im bank has nothing, nothing, to do with transportation.  Adding unrelated amendements has killed the United States political process.Russel lost me with the cheap, untrue, shot at conservatives, some of whom opposed the bill not on its merits, but due to the Ex-Im reauthorization (which happened due to a parlimentary maneuver supported by every single house Democrat).  Nonetheless, saying many, rather than most, conservatives is very unfair; the bill passed 363-64, supported by supermajorities of both parties.This is not political reporting, it's damned opinion (based on a false assertations) masquerading as news.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I agree.  Wasn't the Ex-Im killed in the same manor, as an amendment to a larger bill?</comment>

<comment>The Ex-Im needed to have its charter nenewed by Congress.  Congress refused to reauthorize it, as it was blocked by the Republican leadership, after considerable public debate and discussion, in June 2015.  There wasn't a single issue vote taken on the Ex-Im bank, which is unfortunate.Both Republicans and Democrats have abused the power of the ruling party to prevent votes on issues that a minority of the ruling, but majority of the whole, support.</comment>

<comment>Close. The House leadership couldn't bring it to the floor because the Bagger wing was against it. Yes, the minority of the majority blocked it.</comment>

<comment>Why would paying for this be an issue???</comment>

<comment>The problem with infrastructure financing is the lack of disinterested analysis.  Everyone advocating for higher spending directly benefits from that higher spending, and so there is little reason to believe that any sorting of useful projects from wasteful make-work is taking place.</comment>

<comment>It's actually incorrect that it's only funded for three years. this explains how the funded it. Still a bandaid, but ... http://usa.streetsblog.org/201...</comment>

<comment>this will help a lotshould have happened long agodesperate, coward republican politics are the reason it didn'tit's easily proven political math</comment>

<comment>wonder how high speed rail figured into all of this?u want to talk about jobs</comment>

<comment>Can California have the old bridge in the picture to replace the new Bay Bridge?  We'd need the sign too.</comment>

<comment>It's in Pittsburgh; come & get it. That's also where the components of the Golden Gate Bridge were manufactured, so must be a way to get it there.</comment>

<comment>Ahhh, the GGB---my favorite man-made structure.  Built back when public works projects came in ahead of schedule and under budget.  Those were the days.</comment>

<comment>"And perhaps most significantly, the legislation does nothing to identify a long-term, sustainable funding source for highway programs going forward. Despite an improved economy and low fuel prices, lawmakers never seriously considered raising the 18.4 cents-a-gallon gas tax, which hasn’t been touched in more than two decades."Thank you,  Grover Norquist,  for getting your buffoons in line.   It's a shame that Democrats and some Republicans wouldn't go all in for a tax holiday for your benefactors.If this is what qualifies as leadership,  Bernie Sanders is right.   We need a revolution.   And with it,  a Federal Fuel tax that adjusts annually to actual budget needs.We have a revenue problem,  and it clearly exposes the leadership problem in Washington. </comment>

<comment>If this is what qualifies as leadership, Bernie Sanders is right. We need a revolution. And with it, a Federal Fuel tax that adjusts annually to actual budget needs.===================Why do you want a revolution to pay more in taxes?  You silly progressives.</comment>

<comment>I use 9 gallons of gas in a Dodge Caravan each week.   It would be less than a dollar a week to raise the tax to a sustainable level.   I cannot do a  wheel alignment for what it would cost me to support better roads.Silly Conservatives.   You flunked math and keep trying to pass yourself off as a budget genius.No wonder Ryan's budget plan is a a laughingstock.   No wonder Republican Presidential candidates are howling at CNBC for their temerity in asking why none of their budget plans add up.You have a math problem,  a revenue problem and a leadership problem.  Silly Buck Rogers needs to take off his space helmet and take a long look at the real world. </comment>

<comment>Silly Conservatives. You flunked math and keep trying to pass yourself off as a budget genius.==================lets talk about the budget.</comment>

<comment>No wonder Ryan's budget plan is a a laughingstock.========================What parts of the budget to find  objectionable?</comment>

<comment>The part where he starts out saying he wants to balance the budget and then proposes a whopping tax cut for the ultra wealthy.  That part.Doesn't make sense.  You don't decrease revenue when you want to balance the budget.</comment>

<comment>You have a math problem, a revenue problem and a leadership problem.============================Since WWII..the US has seen 7 or 8 budget surpluses.  What did each one have in common?</comment>

<comment>Bucky, we've only had ONE budget surplus.  It was under Clinton.  All other administrations have witnessed an increase in the Federal Debt.The thing that drove that budget surplus?  Higher taxes and a robust economy with high employment.</comment>

<comment>Someone shouldn't strap Norquist into a car with broken shocks and drive him around on potholed roads until he allows his lackeys to raise the gas tax. I am fairly sure most of the rational ones would like to do this so very sensible thing.</comment>

<comment>Sen. Jim Imhofe, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, is actually going to help move a major boost in infrastructure spending through Congress? I'll believe it when I see it.His buddy Jeff Sessions is going to protest that "we're not made out of money" until the roof caves in. Or until a Republican is elected President, in which case he'll moderate his views.And- raising the gas tax???Quelle horreur!</comment>

<comment>Maybe they should cut the $18 billion gift to the banks. That will help pay for some of it. Also what happened to the Freedom Caucus and their fiscal responsibility? Just giving $18 billion away without paying for it. Turncoats. I see Ryan is giving our money away faster then Boehner ever did.</comment>
