<comment>"revenues of nearly $19 million and more than 100,000 employees"Not very efficient, are they?</comment>

<comment>It's because they're running stories instead of stores.</comment>

<comment>"Dollar General Corporationâ€”a huge chain-store enterprise with revenues of nearly $19 million and more than 100,000 employees"I believe that should have read "$19 billion", with a "b", rather than million.</comment>

<comment>The error has been corrected.</comment>

<comment>" the local store agreed to bring young tribal members to work as interns"I know this wasn't the point of the story, but the idea of an unpaid internship at a dollar store just blows my mind.  It might be one thing if we were talking about college students interning at the corporate headquarters... but at the store level?</comment>

<comment>Good point - taking out the trash at a Chocktaw Dollar Store ain't exactly being a page at the 30 Rock Rainbow Room - and, while let us hope that these kids can learn *something* about commerce and the working world in an area that is pretty bereft of both, would it kill Dollar General's bottom line too much if they flipped the interns a few bucks?</comment>

<comment>Whom can tribal court try!</comment>

<comment>That last comment is perfect! "For the past 30 years, the Court has fretted over the idea of tribes having their own courts and laws. But more and more, it seems, it finds that wealthy corporations need a special set of their own."</comment>

<comment>Pretty close to 100% of tribal court judges are Democrats.  So we know how the Supreme Court will decide.</comment>

<comment>When's the last time you ever heard a republican talk about native Americans outside of the apple pie narrative of Thanksgiving? </comment>

<comment>When is the last time you heard anyone talk about native Americans other than relating to betting or substance abuse?</comment>

<comment>Been a while,  that's for sure</comment>

<comment>The Indian tribes should be declared "defeated nations" and incorporated into America.  Their courts and casinos are scams to suck money from the innocent so the "tribe" can rent out their lands and move to New York City.  Don't blame them but enough is enough and we should put an end to all this</comment>

<comment>come on there are only a few of us indigenous people left after all of our 100,000,000 ancestors got wiped out. Now you want to "Americanize" what little of us there is left???? How selfish can you be..... Shame Shame Shame</comment>

<comment>In war, winner takes all-we won, you lost live with it.  Besides, admit it, you rent out the Casinos to Donald Trump and moved to New York City decades ago</comment>

<comment>The whole concept of the Indian courts is weird. I understand the history of it, and why it still exists, but I think it still occupies a rather strange position in American policy and jurisprudence, as the various tribes are, like Puerto Rico, both part of the United States and their own entities. Perhaps we should just eliminate the courts and put everyone within the borders of the country under one set of laws?</comment>

<comment>One country, one legal system, no exceptions and no "special law" for different groups.</comment>

<comment>"A New York-born Anglo . . .  Pommersheim"The use of "Anglo" as a synonym for "white" really needs to end, it is just idiotic. Not every white person is English-descended.</comment>

<comment>WHOM</comment>

<comment>What's an "Anglo?"</comment>

<comment>To suggest that indian tribes have sovereign authority over anything or anyone but their own tribal members in their relations with each other is preposterous and illogical. Tribal land is owned by tribes, it is not sovereign territory. The Choctaw are not a sovereign authority over people who do not wish to be tribal members and who they do not claim as tribal members. </comment>

<comment>US gov't is an engine for distributing Indian property to American nationals. Tribal gov't and lawyers tend to participate in the extinguishment of remnant tribal sovereignty. Shoshone stopped $10 billion dollar nuclear waste repositpry because the US cannot prove ownership due to Treaty of Ruby Valley. Shoshone are pressing inherent sovereignty consistent with Organic Law of many western states. No portion of Indian country is to be included in any state or territory. Therefore, tribes must realize their original trust relationship to the US...trust relationship is ours too, again. We came to America's aid through treaty and resulted in this nation that we are apart of.</comment>
