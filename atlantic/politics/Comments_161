<comment>Well, if you do live in SF can't you just go hang out at some Berkeley coffee houses or something instead of making a fool of yourself on-line? If you are a degreed person you're not using your education to good advantage by posting B/S that adds nothing to the conversation. Or you're just a troll with anti-social traits, and so are pretty much destined to fail.</comment>

<comment>Please stop encouraging this guy.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I know it does no good to feed them, so I don't know why I tried to reason with him. He appears to be infesting The Atlantic's threads which is a strange place to troll. The threads here are mostly populated by intelligent, reasonable folks that are not susceptible to trolling.</comment>

<comment>"The threads here are mostly populated by intelligent, reasonable folks that are not susceptible to trolling."hmmm, I want to agree with you...</comment>

<comment>I guess it's all relative. Over the last few years I've visited political sites like National Review, Politco, HuffPo,  as well as the NYT and WaPo threads occasionally, and so forth. The comments there are a cause for real despair in this country's future. The GOP base has fallen completely off the edge of the flat Earth that it believe exists, and the level of anger shown there is really quite frightening. The articles and threads here don't seem to attract the same level of ignorance and shouting that are seen elsewhere. And sometimes you can actually engage in an intelligent and reasonable conversation.</comment>

<comment>This is true.  If you stay away from the Trump threads, the quality of commenters here is pretty high.</comment>

<comment>You missed the boat. This  used  to be the highest quality news comment board on the internet until about 2 years ago when The Atlantic let go of their moderators and allowed the site get linked to Breitbart and etc. Been downhill ever since.</comment>

<comment>Breitbart!!!!?? Holy Mother of God, if the web has an overflowing septic tank that site would be it. Breibart is the last stop before one starts reading the stuff on Stormfront.  And, yeah, I wish I had been here sooner.</comment>

<comment>Haha, I definitely know what you mean but I think he's right.  Even most of the trolls here write in complete sentences.  Definitely seems to be less hatred here than in other publications' comboxes (which, I admit, is not setting a high bar.)</comment>

<comment>Have you looked in the mirror lately? Please explain what you added to the conversation? Douche!</comment>

<comment>A leisurely look at your comments shows you have a lot of pent-up anger that you like to hurl. Those blood pressure spikes are not healthy.</comment>

<comment>French is a white language. Be strong be diverse.</comment>

<comment>Does your user name refer to things that have be quickly looked at by Toby or that Toby speeks because Toby can't speell?</comment>

<comment>I must constantly remind white peoples to get their act together before they become a minority and then they will pay.</comment>

<comment>Stop encouraging "Troll" King Curmudgeon II. He's so far up the ass of the Republican Party, he can't help but be a parrot for the extreme right.</comment>

<comment>"White trash" Lol! You don't really believe in diversity do you? And Hillary supports the working man you say?  WTH do you think does the work that gives you all the goodies that makes your latte swilling, corian counter life so full of pretentious self-actualization?</comment>

<comment>White trash is the opposite of diversity. Diversity is strength. What does that make white trash?</comment>

<comment>It makes you the Racist for using the term.</comment>

<comment>You can't be racist against white people. White people dont even qualify for equal protection under the law. In fact, the original intent of the Equal Protection Amendment was to protect POC, not white people. We just need to get a few more liberal Supreme Court Justices, then we can give white people what they really deserve.</comment>

<comment>Sunscreen?</comment>

<comment>But sometimes you have to call white trash "white trash", for the same reason that you have to call panda bears "panda bears".</comment>

<comment>He's just a racist kid with a troll account.</comment>

<comment>The dude you're responding to is a troll that changes his handle more often than he changes his underwear.Just flag the moron and ignore him.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the alert but sometimes I just need to push back, troll or not.</comment>

<comment>For what it's worth, Paul LePage was about as marginalized as it was possible to be for a child growing up in Lewiston, Maine in the 1950s and 60s.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_LeP...</comment>

<comment>He's still a racist, drooling, knuckle dragging, mental midget.</comment>

<comment>Look in mirror.  See the Racist.</comment>

<comment>All whites are racist. The difference between us is that I recognize my racism and work super hard to repent of my white privileges. </comment>

<comment>Would that this were true. Privilege doesn't need to be repented of (unlike racism, which does), but it does need to be recognized and used appropriately. I guess even a troll, like a stopped clock, can be right occasionally.</comment>

<comment>"courageous" Mr. J is a conservative troll wearing a mask of the nonexistent anti-white racist.  It's all pretend.</comment>

<comment>Whiteness is a mask. Remove it and see the light!</comment>

<comment>Does your oppo-trolling ever work?</comment>

<comment>Sometimes he gets other conservatives mad at him</comment>

<comment>Conservatives are always mad unlike liberals who never ever riot.</comment>

<comment>The word "racist" no longer means anything, libtard.</comment>

<comment>"Libtard"? What are you five years old?</comment>

<comment>He is still white so no matter how poor he is, he does not deserve any help whatsoever.All white people have it so good. They should stop complaining.</comment>

<comment>I'm curious: why do you think that?</comment>

<comment>Don't feed the troll (I mean, you can if you like, I suppose...)</comment>

<comment>All white people have it good?  You clearly have not traveled around the US.</comment>

<comment>"All white people have it so good. They should stop complaining."___Lots of white people have sucky lives... but not because they're white.no reason that white people shouldn't complain, as long as they complain about the right things. For example, it's perfectly legitimate for a white person to complain along the lines of "I hate that I'm so stupid that I can't take advantage of being white".</comment>

<comment>No one should ever feel sorry for a white person. First we will take their guns, then their equal protection, then their property. </comment>

<comment>"Maine needs a margarinalized person to be governor."___In theory, a margarinalized person would be butter.</comment>

<comment>Thus have I spoken.</comment>

<comment>Why did Maine voters put this chump in Office twice?</comment>

<comment>There are a lot of hicks up here.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't the "hicks" that voted for him. It was the southern part of the state that thought they would see tax reform that would enable the rich to get richer. That didn't happen either though.</comment>

<comment>You'd get richer if you could, wouldn't you?</comment>

<comment>That's astoundingly untrue.</comment>

<comment>http://www.politico.com/2014-e...</comment>

<comment>Geez, I wish I was as cool and hip as you are.  I guess "diversity" will rid Maine of the hicks and ensconce a truly enlightened electorate.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, a lot of racist hicks up here who think scum like LePage should hold public office.</comment>

<comment>Does your mom know you're on the computer again? Stop using all her AOL minutes.</comment>

<comment>Oh - you burned me. Grab the bandages, folks; call the burn unit.</comment>

<comment>It didn't help that there are also a lot of homophobes, and his democratic opponent was uncloseted early in the race.  It's also a shame that Maine lost a democratic senator as a result.</comment>

<comment>It was sort of the same situation as Ralph Nader siphoning enough progressive votes to expose the country to George Bush for eight years. The first election had low attendance and the second had a bear-baiting referendom that brought all the rednecks out of the back woods.</comment>

<comment>Bear baiting, of all things. lol</comment>

<comment>Yes, I learned during the election that Maine black bears are particularly fond of Dunkin Donuts as their last meal.</comment>

<comment>Both races had three major candidates, so LePage won with less than 50% of the vote both times.</comment>

<comment>They could really use instant run-off voting.</comment>

<comment>We all could.</comment>

<comment>Well, it was pretty weird how it happened actually. He is pretty hated in Maine.http://www.politico.com/magazi...</comment>

<comment>Thanks. Perhaps Maine should think about making the majority a win, not a plurality.</comment>

<comment>The same reason Trump is doing so well. He appeals to those with little education and fewer teeth.</comment>

<comment>Blame the gerry mandered districts around Portland</comment>

<comment>Gerrymandering does not affect statewide races such as governor.</comment>

<comment>Yes you are correct - I am using the term to derisively refer to them, but I can see the confusion</comment>

<comment>It was the ones who don't vote who help put someone like LePage, Jindal, Brownback or Abbott in office.Or who keep "re-electing" someone as worthless as Charlie Rangel.</comment>

<comment>From second hand information given by some Maine residents.  Maine has a serious problem with welfare roles, a large drug user population, and not enough cash to cover the costs.  LePage was elected to make the hard call over how long/much/who/etc people would qualify for welfare.  No one wants to admit it, but this was popular for those not receiving welfare payments.</comment>

<comment>Plot?  I've heard the news clips.  The guy is a disgusting bigot.</comment>

<comment>And all the drug dealers coming to Maine are French Canadian, right?</comment>

<comment>For what it's worth, there's no shortage of French-Canadian drug dealers in Maine.  (For that matter, there's no shortage of English-American drug dealers whose ancestors first came to this country centuries ago.)</comment>

<comment>I just hope they're not impregnating your lovely white Maine girls.</comment>

<comment>Some are, especially in the cocaine and pill market.  Most, especially in the heroin trade, are white and black people from the Boston and New York areas.  Which makes it really mystifying that the governor decided to speak as though they were all black.Nah, just kidding.  It's no mystery at all why he has a very specific image of a drug dealer in his mind.  Or, for that matter, why some people feel compelled to defend LePage.</comment>

<comment>Yeah there is no reason why you wouldn't want your daughter to have a black child. Black people are exactly the same. Evolution stopped at the neck!</comment>

<comment>For such a bunch of rugged iconoclasts, it sure is funny how you neckbeard Nazis rely so heavily on the repetition of simple slogans and inside jokes.  I mean, come on, it's [current year].  Work on some new material.</comment>

<comment>You think those girls who got mass diversified were right wing before their groping? Remember that you're my entertainment not the other way around.</comment>

<comment>There's two ways you can tell when someone is fascinated by something.  They find ways to shoehorn their fascination into any conversation, either to gush over it, or to express disgust for it.  It's like how you can always tell which right-wingers are closeted gays, instead of just run-of-the-mill bigots: They just can't stop discussing and describing gay sex acts, although they're very careful to remind you how awful those acts are while doing so.This is why you "alt-right" clones are so funny to the rest of us.  It's obvious that you spend a lot of time jacking it to interracial porn, and twistedly resent the rest of us for the shame this makes you feel.Oh well.  At least you have pseudoscience and childlike cartoons to make you feel that, despite being just another carbon-copy Internet crackpot, you are at least superior to anyone from a different race, even if they happen to be wealthier, better-educated, and more able to have adult conversations.So, yeah...you're the entertainment here.  But it's a guilty pleasure, like laughing at a child trying a cigarette.Now, do you have any comments on the impeachment of Paul LePage, or the drug trade in northern New England?  Because that's what the grown-ups are discussing here</comment>

<comment>Like laughing at a retarded chicken.</comment>

<comment>I believe the term is "developmentally challenged chicken."  But I'm not sure; I'm old and didn't go to a very good college.</comment>

<comment>That's mentally-challenged chicken, please!</comment>

<comment>There's one way to sniff out a liberal; i.e. by observing that his comment runs to book length and is incomprehensible.</comment>

<comment>Your life must be pretty rough if you think eleven sentences of plain English are like an incomprehensible book.  I hope things get better for you.  Good luck!</comment>

<comment>"mass diversified" ! Excellent!</comment>

<comment>"neckbeard Nazis" now there's a very complex slogan!</comment>

<comment>Above or below?</comment>

<comment>You mean to tell me Mainers are too lazy to be drug dealers themselves?</comment>

<comment>Yeah what a disgusting bigot! I can't believe he cares about white girls! Don't worry Carol, I can assure you that no one wants to protect you. You should take a vacation to cologne...</comment>

<comment>Perhaps Maine's legislature can appropriate funds to send LePage to Oregon to join the Bundy Boys' insurrection. He seems to be of like mind.</comment>

<comment>All the other states in New England could easily fit within the borders of Maine, so not really a "small state".  Low Population?  Yes, at 1.3M.  White?  Yes, with 95% of the population.  Conservative?  Depends on where you live and IF you got your lazy a** to the polls to vote.  We live in a 70% Red voting area, but our population is low so we unfortunately couldn't keep this slob from office....twice!  People need to realize their actions, and inactions, have long term results and if they want to improve their communities and/or personal welfare they need to vote for the candidate that can deliver for them.  LePage is a corrupt, bigoted, bullying pig of a politician but at least I have the right to complain because I voted against him.  It's easy to sit in Portland around a coffee shop table grooming your lumberjack hipster beard and waxing on about our horrible governor, but maybe that same group should look around the table and ask who actually made it to the polls on election day.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, I ran some back of the napkin calculations last week, and determined that Maine's ~16.7 million acres of privately owned forest roughly represent an area the size of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont put together.  Maine is a deceptively large state.  It's also has the fewest residents per square mile of any state east of the Mississippi, if I am not mistaken.</comment>

<comment>You know what the author meant. Maine is a "small" state. Alaska is a "small" state too.</comment>

<comment>So you blame Portland "hipsters"? Portland, in one of only two counties that LePage LOST? If Portland was at fault, then why did LePage lose by nearly 12% in Cumberland County? If you really need to blame someone, blame the voters in Androscoggin, Franklin and Oxford. </comment>

<comment>Trump/La Page '16! "Make America Sh!t It's Pants Again!"</comment>

<comment>OMG! Best comment ever! :D That would be it. We would be DONE as a country. I say let China buy our country if that happens. We would be better off Communist at that point! :D</comment>

<comment>Trump nomination means Bernie would win in a landslide, so you're not far off :)</comment>

<comment>We all thought that up in Maine when Michaud ran against LePage - that's dangerous thinking.</comment>

<comment>At least it's entertaining.</comment>

<comment>I think you all are missing the real point.House Speaker Mark Eves, a Democrat, accepted a job as president of Good Will-Hinckley.  Why would this very powerful opponent of the school accept this job at a school he said he wanted to close?  .Answer: as a bribe to take their money and stop his attacks in the state house against them.  A quid pro quo.  They pay him money and he stops his and his fellow democrats attacks..Eves needs to be impeached!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</comment>

<comment>Why don't you just join up now and save yourself the wait?</comment>

<comment>How dare a white man be concerned for white girls! What a monster! Doesn't he know that white girls must embrace diversity like in cologne and Rotherham???</comment>

<comment>You sound like courageousmisterj's slightly damaged twin brother. Love the irony of calling yourselves "strong and courageous". So not happening for you guys. Ever.</comment>

<comment>You sound like a snarky teenage girl. What are you even taking about?</comment>

<comment>Wow Courageousmisterj. You thought you weren't effective enough trolling under one handle so you go and create a sock puppet? Bravo!</comment>

<comment>I know it's hard for you to comprehend but there is more than a few people that disagree with you. Look through my disqus history for yourself.</comment>

<comment>If what the author says about The LePage-Eve's controversy is correct then why shouldn't the governor object to Eve's appointment which sounds like a great big package of political pork if there ever was one. If Eve didn't support the whole charter school initiative (as according to the article) then why should he even want to be involved.  This is just the liberals setting a trap.</comment>

<comment>Yes. I blame Obama too!And yet, Eve was hired by the school despite his public opposition. Maybe he simply was the best qualified person for the job. Perhaps some of his critiques were valid and the school thought that by hiring him they could avoid those pitfalls because this guy Eve was well informed about them already?Or "liberals! Argh! Scourge of the flat earth!  Argh!"</comment>

<comment>I guess I'm sort of saying that if he was in opposition from the start that disqualifies him.  It would be somewhat if I applied for an accounting job and said that I was really against accounting standards or something like that.</comment>

<comment>I can only speculate as to what nature his opposition took. Perhaps he thought they would be great but didn't trust the government to do it right so he opposed on that principle.What I do know is that the school actually wanted him to be their employee. The person who was best qualified to determine the nature of the opposition felt that it wasn't enough to disqualify Eve.Again, this is a private corporation hiring a person to fill a vacancy and not a government appointment so the rules and procedures are likely different.</comment>

<comment>Obviously LePage didn't like him but that's just politics and, in fact, that's just the way the world works and to treat it as a political death blow is exactly how the liberal press would spin it.</comment>

<comment>And if the Obama administration told GM it wouldn't back the bailout unless it fired/refused to hire a political opponent of the White House? You think Fox news and Breitbart and the Blaze would think that was just hunky dory? Using the threat of government money to influence private hiring decisions is unethical no matter who does it.</comment>

<comment>Trump will pick Lepage as his running mate.  A brave man who knows what America needs.  And black people love him.</comment>

<comment>LePage is too nuts even for Trump.Trump is an ass, of course, and completely wrong about immigration.  But he is FAR more liberal than LePage.</comment>

<comment>That is not what the three of us were talking about at breakfast this morning.</comment>

<comment>Are you being ironic?</comment>

<comment>I am not smart enough to be ironic.  All my comments mean exactly what they say.  Go Trump!  Go LePage!</comment>

<comment>Okaaaay</comment>

<comment>Good.  It makes me happy when people agree to vote for the Great American.  America for the Americans!</comment>

<comment>It's someone mocking our dear old friend spud.  Real spud is not capitalized, this guy's name is.  It threw me the first time I saw one of this guy's comments, too.</comment>

<comment>Oh, that makes more sense then.</comment>

<comment>This man said something truthful about a problem in his state. Start the shaming brigade!</comment>

<comment>White girls getting pregnant from transient black drug dealers is a problem in Maine? I'd love to see the stats on that one.</comment>

<comment>It's really weird that, sixty years later, we're back to talking about miscegenation.</comment>

<comment>One time some guy called my daughter a mulatto and I had to hold my wife back. Lol.</comment>

<comment>Really? I'd have let her kick him so hard his dick would replace his tonsils.</comment>

<comment>playin' all the oldies</comment>

<comment>No, he really didn't.  I lived in the North Country for the last ten years, and most of the out-of-state pill and heroin are white junkies (men and women) from Boston and New York.  Plenty are black men, but it's weird* that LePage would only focus on them while talking about the drug trade.* Just kidding, it's not weird at all.  It's drearily predictable.</comment>

<comment>republicans do trash talking crazy so well.  They should manage their nomination process like a reality tv show.  Oh, wait....</comment>

<comment>I blame statins and blood pressure medication.  Without those two medical advances, foaming-at-the-mouth ragenuts would be self-solving problems.</comment>

<comment>Say it with me, everybody:  Maine: New England's very own Alabama.</comment>

<comment>Kind of true.</comment>

<comment>Sad but true.  Of course, pretty much the only thing keeping New Hampshire from becoming Maine is the fact that most of the population of NH lives within commuting distance of white-collar jobs in Massachusetts.  New Hampshire isn't wealthy because of the rural libertarians who live in the northern 2/3 of its land.</comment>

<comment>The sad thing is you don't even recognizes this as bigotry..</comment>

<comment>You might take a look at election results from the last couple of decades.  Northern New Hampshire is a lot more liberal that you give it credit for.  Coös County, the northernmost in the state, has voted for the Democrat in every presidential election since 1992 except one.  Grafton county, the next northernmost, has gone for the Democrat every one of those elections.On the other hand, the most Masshole-infested counties in the state, Hillsborough (where Nashua and Manchester are located) and Rockingham (where Portsmouth and Derry are located) have gone GOP in 3 and 4 of those elections, respectively.I suspect that you misunderstand the influence Massachusetts has on New Hampshire.  It is primarily sub/ex-urban conservatives who leave Massachusetts for New Hampshire, where they can live tax free and commute to their high-paying jobs in and around Boston.  It's not urban or rural liberals.Northern New Hampshire is much more like Vermont - historically progressive, and historically a supporter of liberal Republicans.  Liberal Republicans died off in the past couple of decades, so New Hampshiremen and New Hampshirewomen have found the candidates that most line up with their values are Democrats.</comment>

<comment>You may well be right; my NH knowledge isn't the strongest.  Mostly just a place with a few nice lakes and a really sweet seaside city to me.  Thanks for the info.</comment>

<comment>He's right. By nearly every statistical measure, Maine is the poorest, most backward state in the whole Northeast.</comment>

<comment>I know, I live there! </comment>

<comment>For how long?</comment>

<comment>Born and raised. Left for about 16 years and just came back about a year and half ago.</comment>

<comment>*nod* welcome back then.</comment>

<comment>Thx.</comment>

<comment>Define backwards.</comment>

<comment>Cute... and no.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that's a pretty bone headed statement. Maine has it's own distinctive culture (several actually) and as a member of the state that served up Margret Chase Smith, Ed Muskie, Bill Cohen, Olympia Snowe, George Mitchell, and Susan Collins, I think we hold our own against any other state in the union and are as corruption free as anywhere.Have we got a governor who's rough around the edges. We sure do. Do the Dems in the state have a problem as they couldn't field a candidate that could beat him? Yep.  Do we live in rough political times, we sure do but does one ignorant, bigoted statement deserve to be answered with another? (I assume you're looking down your nose at Alabama here too).  No. It only further coarsens an already broken political debate in this country. It makes for cute tweets but at the end of the day it's just another demeaning empty statement.</comment>

<comment>If it is found that there were laws broken, I support LePage being impeached. Until then: I stand with LePage, and I call on all conservatives countrywide to do the same! If this man is impeached without any laws being broken, it sets a precedent, and conservative governors countrywide are vulnerable. Stand with LePage!</comment>

<comment>Maine should probably start gathering together in community groups across the state and try to figure out why they voted for a Republican governor. That's the problem that really needs solving.</comment>

<comment>Because white people. That's why. We just need to find out how to take care of the white peoples.</comment>

<comment>Easy! We can just bring in a few million "migrants" from Islamic countries. Problem solved!</comment>

<comment>Illegal immigrant is divisive. Undocumented Democrat is the preferred nomenclature.</comment>

<comment>Which  government used it's executive authority to have political opponents fired from their civilian jobs.A: RussiaB: ChinaC: MaineD: all of the above. Answer: D: all of the above.</comment>

<comment>Um...  What government on earth hasn't done that?  Even in a Democracy politics is a full contact sport. </comment>

<comment>Lepage has been calling up private companies and telling the owner he will "withdraw his support"  unless the employer fires anyone who isn't a Lepage supporter.</comment>

<comment>Since the state is these company's top customer, they need to keep him happy.Much as I hate to defend an idiot like LePage, strong-arm tactics like this go on in every country at all levels of government. If you choose a career in which your job depends on political connections, you should know how this game is played and don't cry when you lose.</comment>

<comment>You sell your freedom cheap.</comment>

<comment>You don't really believe that Democrats have never engaged in this kind of thing  and worse do you?  http://www.washingtontimes.com...</comment>

<comment>How does that make it OK?</comment>

<comment>Sorry Maine.  You elected this idiot.  Now live with the consequences. Next time pay attention when you vote.</comment>

<comment>Potential Trump voters, pay heed. Let's not repeat this on a national scale.</comment>

<comment>I thought this is what they want? If anything LePage is too moderate for them.</comment>

<comment>If he can be vetoed all the time what's the problem.  It sounds like the voters for legislators are all smart people like you.</comment>

<comment>Oh, thanks for advice; I'll just cast my vote for Hillary and everything will be just fine and we'll be guaranteed no more lies, no more scandals, in fact everything will be "RESET" to multiculti goodness.  Oh, the White House dry cleaning Bill will go up!</comment>

<comment>At this point, the alternative to "Trump" isn't just "Hillary." There is a broad spectrum of crazy on the ticket this year, most of it on the GOP ticket. (most...but not all.) The vast majority of the experienced candidates, regardless of party, including Clinton, are going to be far, far better than Trump and his pack of inexperienced demagogues.</comment>

<comment>How dare a white man be concerned for white girls! What a monster! Doesn't he know that white girls must embrace diversity like in cologne and Rotherham?!?!</comment>

<comment>The best reason for not impeaching LePage is that we'd then have another republican governor. We don't have a Lt. Governor in Maine. The next person in line is the Senate leader, a republican. Given that he'd be a major upgrade to LePage, (as anyone would) he'd probably get elected in 2018. I'd rather put up with 2 more years of LePage, who is so unpopular that he can't do much more damage. His scores of vetoes last legislative session were mostly overridden by nearly unanimous votes.</comment>

<comment>That's helpful to know. As I was reading the article, I was wondering why the Democrats weren't jumping at the chance to impeach this clown, but you've given a good explanation.</comment>

<comment>It's a silly explanation. Impeachment is serious business and should not be subject to whether partisan advantage can be gained or not. If Le page has to go he has to go, who his successor is should not matter.</comment>

<comment>I agree with you that it shouldn't matter. But, to many politicians, it does; and this explains the Democrats' hesitation, which I hadn't been able to fathom. I'd personally like to see LePage gone, regardless.</comment>

<comment>"Impeachment is serious business and should not be subject to whether partisan advantage can be gained or not."______________Assassination should be subject to this rule, too. But assassins are rarely big tent consensus builders.</comment>

<comment>The explanation the article gives is probably persuasive enough: if impeachment won't pass the Maine Senate, which appears doubtful, then the risk of alienating Republicans who have been cooperative in what appears to be a fairly congenial legislature seems serious enough.For a legislature focused on legislating instead of politics, impeachment proceedings may look like inviting politics to take over the stage.</comment>

<comment>It could indeed. The Democrats in the legislature may conclude they've got a good thing going, so why upset it? On the other hand, they may be facing pressure from constituents who want to get rid of this laughingstock.</comment>

<comment>So if the Maine Dems can consistently veto LePage you don't really have a legislative problem at all do you?</comment>

<comment>The veto overrides were bipartisan. The senate has a majority  of Republicans, the house a majority of Democrats. For the most part, they all get along pretty well and are willing to compromise to get stuff done.</comment>

<comment>Or the idiots of Maine, and they do appear to be mostly idiots, could vote him out.  Why are the Canadians just a few miles away so much smarter than the dumb rednecks of Maine? </comment>

<comment>Given the popularity of Trump and Cruz, who are in good company with this Le Page moron, I wouldn't limit my criticism to just Maine. It appears to have spread from sea to shining sea.</comment>

<comment>Not where I live </comment>

<comment>I wished I lived in a state with no Trump supporters. I envy you.</comment>

<comment>I get that the Republicans don't want to lose the governor's office in Maine, but they should be embarrassed by this clown. Not that the party has any shortage of people making them look bad, but they could certainly do with one less. If they had any sense they'd get behind this, too.</comment>

<comment>That's a very nice Democrat avatar you have.</comment>

<comment>Keep it in your pants</comment>

<comment>I don't live there and so don't have any skin in Maine's game, but I do feel sorry for the State having such a nut for Guv.. I mean they have all those cool lighthouses, fishing villages, L.L. Bean, lobster rolls, and so forth.</comment>

<comment>Now I'm hungry for some lobster :(</comment>

<comment>This isn't Maine's 1st Governor who's a KKK member and it probably won't be our last!We have a long heritage of KKK racism in Maine and the klan's numbers are growing in the state.Sadly, LePage demonstrates how far we have fallen on equality and how inept the Democrats have become by basically moving to the right Vs sticking to its values and fighting for EQUALITY: racial, religious, sexual, and economic.  Instead, Maine and the US have become more unequal since Reagonomics and the Republicans refusing to defend Democracy over greed and fascism.</comment>

<comment>Yeah he expressed concern for white girls! He may as well have lynched Emmett till's grandson. It's exactly the same!</comment>

<comment>Not exactly. He expressed the white supremacist view of blacks in this country. That might fly in the deep, red south, but it shouldn't be tolerated in the educated north.</comment>

<comment>One wonders why it's only white girls he's worried about. Shouldn't he worry about all young citizens of Maine?</comment>

<comment>Hah look up where racist phrases are mostly Googled. Plenty of racists up north too.</comment>

<comment>All across the country there are Tea Party nimrods f$&king up the government from the state house to the US congress. When stupid @$$holes vote and rational voters sleep in, American democracySuffers. People need to take voting seriously and not see politics as reality tv.</comment>

<comment>So,after an investigation found that whatever he did was legal, all we have is allegations.</comment>

<comment>Am I supposed to know who this guy is, let alone this "Maine" place they keep referring to?</comment>

<comment>Its where lobsters come from.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yes! Didn't he know that only black lives matter??</comment>

<comment>I say keep him, he's doing a great job of showing everyone what Republicans actually are.</comment>

<comment>Mr. LePage! Welcome to the Atlantic!</comment>

<comment>Any comments on your pending impeachment?</comment>

<comment>OK, but why would anyone appoint someone opposed to charter schools to run one?  Was this an attempt to destroy the school at the expense of the public or is the assertion that he opposes charters incorrect?  LePage may be loud but his critics seem to be playing a crooked game as well.</comment>

<comment>Good, Charter schools are stupid.</comment>

<comment>The parents who want to get their kids out of the failed public schools think differently.</comment>

<comment>Hooray for them</comment>

<comment>Not "appoint" but "hired." the school hired him. They interviewed people and chose Eve. Maine has a part-time legislature and this was Eve's full-time job.There are any number of reasons why he might have been hired. One reason is that his opposition to them had valid points and the school may have thought this qualified him to run the school in a way that would avoid those pitfalls.</comment>

<comment>Guy's clearly kind of an angry prick who chooses his words poorly, but get real. There's palpable frustration about heroin in his state, and his words reflected that.The PC police want to scream bloody murder over what he said, yet turn a blind eye to the problem itself, since it doesn't affect them.The people who elected him ARE dealing with the societal scourge that heroin is, and don't really give a shit how he describes the problem, just what he's going to do about it.</comment>

<comment>Actually his comments are a distraction from the fight against heroin. Blaming it on someone else, an outsider, is a typical conservative tactic to do nothing.</comment>

<comment>Sure. Blaming outsiders instead of burning all those poppy fields in Maine really doesn't make any sense.</comment>

<comment>Maine's drug problem is because people are consuming it there.  It has nothing to do with where the drugs are coming from.</comment>

<comment>Right. As long as there's demand, drugs will magically appear out of nowhere. I forgot that fact.</comment>

<comment>Don't be silly. Don't you know that diminishing the supply will do nothing to learn the demand? People don't care about cost.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like he won the last election because there were too many people eager to take his spot and get rid of him.</comment>

<comment>I voted for LePage the first time around because...get this...he claimed to be a consensus builder that worked well with both parties. Even for a politician, that turned out to be a pretty big whopper. The majority of people in Maine now see him for what he truly is - a schoolyard bully. After one of his infamous incidents, he said he would change...but he didn't. And he won't. Research shows that the right way to deal with a bully is to stand up to him. I hope the legislature remembers that.</comment>

<comment>Fool me once shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Tell that to your neighbors who reelected this guy.</comment>

<comment>I thought it was, "fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, and... Um... You won't fool me again."😂</comment>

<comment>That's the saying we have in Texas, maybe it's Tennessee (or something like that).</comment>

<comment>Completely agree.  By the way, Maine will have a referendum on the ballot this year to use ranked order voting for candidates for Congress and governor.  This system would have prevented LePage from being elected in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Holy cow, that Toronto mayor paraded his insanity and bad behavior around like an honor badge and the people loved it!</comment>

<comment>I hope they fail in the impeachment. This guy is far to entertaining to just go away. Seriously, when has Maine ever received this kind of attention? The guy is a tyrant, but he was elected by the people. </comment>

<comment>Is what the governor said true?</comment>

<comment>don't be silly. Truth doesn't matter. Trust the media to give you the truth they think you need. Like in cologne.</comment>

<comment>"D-Money" is literally the nickname that the black murderer used. I don't know about half.  Probably just hyperbole.  But it's typical of the mainstream media to be more outraged about calling out the murderers instead of outraged at the murderers.  The MSM thinks the white victims deserve it.</comment>

<comment>Do you think drug dealers have sex with women in exchange for drugs???Do you think the Pope is Catholic?Do you think a bear shitteth in the woods?</comment>

<comment>Good.  That would give him more time to campaign with Trump.  He would make a perfect VP.</comment>

<comment>If only the legislators in Albany had as much gumption as those in Maine.  </comment>

<comment>He must be doing something right.</comment>

<comment>LePages cross-state superhighway to Canadian logging groups was a big joke, universally railed against by Mainers and out-of-staters. They had their hands deep in his pockets</comment>

<comment>Paul LePage is a bigot just like many in the Republican Party. They just can't help themselves it's who they are and always have been. How some voters can't see that by now is beyond me.</comment>

<comment>Those five "darlings" who raped that girl in Central Park, what race were they?DC Metro has a plague of teenage gangs that assault and rob people, what race were they?That's just a piece of the local news last night.Is the truth racist?Notable Democracy Now covered BLM last night and didn't mention these two attacks.Because WHITE PEOPLE BAD, BLACK PEOPLE VICTIMS. That is your game.So this old fool slip-up and says a truth that outrages you.Drug dealers do like to have sex with their customers on occasion. The governor noticed that. He said the wrong thing. The truth.Now, like COSBY, HE MUST BE DESTROYED.</comment>

<comment>The Democrat controlled media only want certain perpetrators.  They yell about rape culture but blame the victims in Germany and tell them to put on more clothing and keep their distance from men.  They ignore the Bill's - Cosby and Clinton and let them get away with serial rapes.  That's why they made up the UVA rape.  They had their perfect perpetrator.  A white frat boy.  It didn't matter that it was entirely fiction or that a black rapist/murderer actually killed a UVA student in the same time frame.</comment>

<comment>Hey, Rupert, embracing diversity I see.  You hate African Americans and Jews.</comment>

<comment>I don't hate people.You are the racist moron.Not all Jews are warmongering racist ZioNazis.Not all African Americans are fools, thugs, Jim Crowsor any other stereotype you get from HOLLYWOOD.You however are STUPID, no matter what color you are.Only stupid people hate."Hate corrodes the vessel which contains it."  - MeYou are leaking.</comment>

<comment>I really hate to burst your bubble here, but having lived in the North Country for a long time, I can assure you that the majority of drug dealers involved in the interstate heroin/pills trade are white junkies from Boston.  Funny how LePage didn't bother to mention them.  I guess he's just not as offended by white drug dealers impregnating Mainers, for some reason.  I bet you can use your super-augmented brain powers to figure out that reason, if you just apply yourself.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they just stand out because they follow the music industry an hollywood's stereotypes.If you white heroin dealers are discreet, well behaved and not playing HOLLYWOOD so they don't call attention to themselves, don't blame me or that fool governor.It makes you look like an ass.I have seen white heroin dealer . . . On TV and in Movies. Demographics do change - not so much in DC, Baltimore, New York or S.F. But that is just my observation.The three white heroin dealers I know of operated and operate night clubs in DC. One got busted. The other quite successful.None of them were street dealers or transporters, but the clubs had staff ready to provide.OK with DC cops too.At the time I was an anti hard drug spokesperson for the Yippies, so I did not get any gigs because I was bad for their side business.Then one of their thugs broke my wrist. You don' t want to know his race.</comment>

<comment>Damn, man.  I've lived in the area for a decade, and you're trying to tell me my experiences are wrong on the basis of some shit you did elsewhere decades ago.You really have no idea what you're talking about here.  The real giveaway is when you act as though pills and heroin move in different markets, because you seem to think it's 1975.  Maybe this is still true in urban environments, but the place I'm talking about - and that the article is talking about - is rural northern New England.In the real world, where grinding rural poverty often gives rise to opioid abuse, the same crowd of people switches back and forth between heroin and prescription pills, depending on price and availability.  And heroin doesn't come from slick dealers, but from junkies who manage to get enough money together to drive up to the country and sell baggies and/or oxys at 4-6 times the retail price in the city.None of these people are "discreet" or "Hollywood."  They're skeezy kids who get pulled over for expired tags, get their cars searched because of open containers or visible drug paraphernalia, and get sent to jail for amounts of heroin and pills that sound huge to the general public, but wouldn't raise an actual drug dealer's eyebrow.Sorry for the reality check from someone who actually lived in the area and still knows people affected by this issue.  You can now return to the exciting movie that you apparently inhabit.</comment>

<comment>Guess you don't have an HMO.Sorry Pal.If it is so bad up there why don't you move to Detroit, Baltimore , or DC???</comment>

<comment>I don't live there anymore, but I miss it dearly.  It's not like living in New York keeps me away from druggies.</comment>

<comment>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Looks like a great movie.  I loves me some Charlize Theron and Fran McDormand.</comment>

<comment>Pills? Different drug culture.</comment>

<comment>30 pills of oxycodone or OxyContin for 10 bucks from you HMO.Somehow interstate trafficking doesn't add up unless this is high level operation, don't you think?Now heroin is different, understand?</comment>

<comment>Vote for a republican doochebag that spews hateful exclusionary rhetoric on the campaign trail, and you get spiteful governance, a la LePage. Im talking to you, Trumpsters. Vote for a dooochebag republican that condemns government, and has no interest in governing, you get criminal governance, a la Rick Snyder, who poisoned a whole city in his state. </comment>

<comment>What you talkin about Willis? Shawn Moody was the Democratic candidate in 2010. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>The real plot against Paul LePage is the Democrats here in Maine were furious that he won over their pet choice Mile Micheau who would have been the first gay governor. They want to get LePage out any way they can. They constantly berate, demean, call him names, insult him, hate him everyday. They are just plain jealous that he won twice. Go Paulie!</comment>
