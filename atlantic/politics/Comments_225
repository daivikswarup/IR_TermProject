<comment>Cooperation is okay. Political gridlock works too. Whichever does more for me and mine is how I'll vote.</comment>

<comment>You're a great citizen.</comment>

<comment>I agree. To each their own.</comment>

<comment>I serve freedom, even against my own interests.  If Bernie Sanders got elected and implemented free healthcare for all and a guaranteed minimum income I'd quit my job immediately and spend my life fishing at the lake, but I'd never vote for him because I don't think other people should pay for me to do what I want.</comment>

<comment>Your preference for a hierarchical, individualistic politics is a trait of your Aryan race. It's hardwired in there.</comment>

<comment>America is already two very different countries, not one nation--which actually requires a common culture and heritage--as opposed to a country. It would be best if we could somehow negotiate a peaceable split so both sides could pursue their own ideals more successfully. It would be extremely difficult, but the consequences of the alternative may become far worse.  </comment>

<comment>Best you'll get is secessions. Or one side utterly dominating the other. Or genocide.</comment>

<comment>Ron Brownstein is already a passive eliminationist*, please don't give him any ideas. Splitting into two wouldn't work too well since it would have to be done on a county-by-county or city-by-city basis and even that would leave many behind enemy lines. CA would be a patchwork quilt with Modoc and Kern counties in Real America and the coastal counties in CommiePinkoLiberalLand.* Ron Brownstein is a passive eliminationist: he (at least so far) doesn't support putting non-liberal whites in cattle cars. He does, however, cheer the declining power of non-liberal whites and attempts to demographically reduce their percentage of the population.</comment>

<comment>au contraire, there is no sound reason why division has to be by political boundaries. Physical and cultural boundaries made it quite feasible to divide. We don't expect couples who have irreconcilable differences to stay together these days. We should simply extend it to its natural conclusion.</comment>

<comment>Naw. Caucasians will struggle under a communitarian or conformist society (as that is against their biological nature), but it will fall far short of genocide. The worst you'll get is a couple dozen Dylan Roofs a year.</comment>

<comment>Some will. Some won't. I'm quite white, Irish/German, and I'm very communitarian.</comment>

<comment>Most white liberals are highly individualistic in other ways, even if their politics are communitarian.</comment>

<comment>My family fought in the first war for Independence and I'll be quite happy to take up freedom's cause in the next one.</comment>

<comment>We have it; it's embedded in the Constitution; and it's called the 10th amendment. The reason for our divide is the massive growth in control of the federal government. There are many good things from that, like the Civil Rights Act and such, but that can't be an excuse to use the federal government to dictate everything in each of the states. The overuse of the Commerce Clause is also fostering anger. This is not limited to one party. It has been happening under both parties for 40 years.</comment>

<comment>Do you believe in State Supremacy at all times, or only when it supports the actions of conservatives?</comment>

<comment>Terry, America is already pretty balkanize already based on income, race, educational level, political affiliation, and religion. </comment>

<comment>Some of this is due to the rise of mass media.In the 60's, there were only 3 channels and they more or less said the same stuff. In the 90's, you saw more and more alternative media rise with the growth of the Internet so now people get their news from a variety of sources and many of them are highly partisan.I want to see how the GOP tries to reach out and expands. They're going to nominate Cruz hopefully, I want to see conservatism fail and people to see the failure of contemporary conservatism, not this "people fail conservatism" logic that popped up after Romney and McCain. This ethnocentric, nihilist conservatism we have today.</comment>

<comment>The idea the GOP or conservatism is "ethnocentric" is hilarious. Southern Yahoo isn't an ethnicity.</comment>

<comment>The GOP practices white identity politics. However, not all fair-skinned Americans of European descent cling to a "white" identity.</comment>

<comment>The Caucasian race is larger than just pale skinned Europeans.</comment>

<comment>It's not too long ago that southern and eastern Europeans weren't considered "white".  Ditto for the Irish.</comment>

<comment>There are also real differences among Caucasians. Celts and Slavs like you mention.White is a social science term that can mean whatever you want it to.</comment>

<comment>"The GOP practices white identity politics".The BNP practices white identity politics. The GOP leadership practices long green identity politics. The GOP base can't spell any of the words in "practices white identity politics".The GOP and conservatism aren't even pro-white. For an example, look at sociopathic efforts like #IAmThe53 (smearing tens of millions of whites), the Randroid/Teaparty habit of calling their fellow Americans "moochers" (ditto), etc. I could provide lots of other examples.The GOP panders to Real Americans using Southern things like country music. That's not pro-white or "white identity politics". That's just crap designed to appeal to Southern Yahoos.</comment>

<comment>Lol. A TNC believer chiding others for being "nihilistic" and "ethnocentric"? That's precious. When that toxic conservatism dies, can I bury the Regressive Left with it?Also I just want to point out how you bailed like a typical shallow religious apologist when I responded point by point to your sophistry on Indonesia last week.  You can't handle a real debate.  You function solely on vapid platitudes about religion. </comment>

<comment>Girl bye. TNC is only nihilistic and ethnocentric to conservatives who blatantly ignore his hopeful ending. I know you operate on the Bernie Sanders socialist logic where class is more important with some socially conservative views on how black Americans are to blame for their own situation but TNC is hardly either. To add to this,  you're the only minority I know who uses the term "white guilt" like its a real thing.Bailed? Fam, I got more to do than argue on the internet and honestly, I didn't see it until around now.You make vague platitudes about Islamic supremacy in nationalist invasions, have no real knowledge of Nigeria and how the ethnocentrism plays a much larger role than religion. Now, ethnic identity and religious identity interplay in Nigeria but they are not the same and in many cases, Nigeria's issues are mostly ethnic.Boko Haram r Muslim! ISIS r Muslim! Islam r issue! Come on, its simplistic.How about both Northern Nigeria and Iraq suffer from weak governments, military repression and are both failed states with no social services or jobs. Boko Haram is a large response to the poverty, corruption and lack of social mobility in Northern Nigeria.Less than 30% of East Timor was Catholic before the invasion, many of them were animalists.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesi...Which country? I see it as the reality of these country's situation. Now, Nigeria has a secular criminal system but people can opt into the Sharia based code. Personally, I see it as a reality of their situation, you have a 50% Muslim population that is largely poor with a weak federal government and legal system. This is going to happen.Indonesia has a secular criminal code. Sharia law is the law in Aech and Muslims can opt into Sharia law for civil matters.I'm saying that this logic of "the X ideology/religion did it" is bullshit logic. Glad you agree with me.How can the religion be the fault of something when it has no agency?But I'm never going to change your mind and I got shit to do.</comment>

<comment>" you're the only minority I know who uses the term 'white guilt' like its a real thing"Not only do many white people admit to feelings of white guilt openly (just search for personal essays on the subject), but the term has been used in sociology since at least the 1970's.  The only people I've seen deny it so utterly are the extreme CRT acolytes like you who despise the term because it sullies your self-image by imparting irrational aspects to your worldview.As usual when faced with an argument that makes you uncomfortable, you lash out with racial or sexually-charged personal attacks that belie your professed values.  If I really am "the only minority" you know who discusses the term, I suggest you cultivate a wider circle of acquittances.  Even black activists who share your general worldview complain about white people who try too hard, i.e. white guilt in action.Your attack reminds me of something I wanted to point out to you, a sociologist studied white supremacists and white 'anti-racists' and came to the conclusion that you resemble one another:http://www.sup.org/books/title...You're not using "platitudes" correctly but thanks for letting me know that label got under your skin.As for East Timor, thank you for finally admitting, however, inadvertently that the population was overwhelmingly non-Muslim, just like the Chinese and West Papuans targeted by an overwhelmingly Muslim central government. The key word in the statistic you cite is "registered" as Catholics.  It's a developing country whose structures were forged by the neo-colonialist assault of Indonesia.  No populace converts that quickly to a religion, rather people who were de facto part of the religion, formalized that status."Sharia law is the law in Aech and Muslims can opt into Sharia law for civil matters."As usual you are disturbingly wrong:http://bigstory.ap.org/article..."people can opt into"This is a hat-trick of white, male, and Western privilege on display.  In conformist social environments, it is not as simple as exercising a choice, something you Islam apologists fail spectacularly to grasp with female-only head coverings.  It doesn't mean that it is fully coercive either.</comment>

<comment>Of course white people use the term. That's obvious and I’m sure you knowthis.Girl bye isn't an adhominem, its more a meme. If you don't like it, I won't useit.https://www.google.com/search?...I have a pretty large circle and no one uses the term white guilt. Its reallymore conservative whites who use the term. I've heard more "I don't havetime for white/male tears" in my circles.You should read this book. I have, it does not say what you think it does. Agood part of his argument is how some anti-racists ignore how racismis systematic. He's arguing that by individualizing racism among other things, people inadvertently support white supremacy. Which is true.You would benefit from this too. Like how your belief that its culture that holds black people back supports white supremacy, he talks about that too.Again, since the government was majority Muslim it was had to be religious right? I mean come on fam, its pretty well established that the government forced these people to convert to one of the "accepted religions" in the name of Indonesian nationalism one of which was Catholicism. If it was Islamic supremacist, why not force them to convert to Islam?The racism against the Chinese in Indonesia is well documented, I don't disagree. However under Suharto it was again nationalism as the Chinese were sort of the "Jews of Indonesia". They were seen as "disloyal" and that they "owned everything".You should listen to Muslim women:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/... Considering its for Muslims only, I'm sure they have a degree of freedom in choosing. Minorities face the secular federal criminal code. Remember that Aceh is also a bargain politically for Indonesia, if they're allowed to have Sharia law, the separatist violence subsides.</comment>

<comment>I saw this and it reminded me of our debate. Moderate, secular Indonesia in action:http://www.asianews.it/news-en..."I'm sure they have a degree of freedom in choosing."For all your bombastic 'anti-racist' rhetoric, your comment is pretty much the epitome of white male privilege.  People often do not have any real choices in non-Western cultural contexts and yet you leftwing Islam apologists base your ferocious defense of Islam on that false premise, rather than listening to ex- or reform Muslim women who tell you the reality:http://www.nytimes.com/roomfor...You prefer to have your self-comforting rationalizations confirmed by believers with a vested interest in protecting Islam from criticism.The personal abuse was not the "bye fam" but yet again your need to attack me as a minority, because I don't live up to your white idea of how a 'real' minority persons thinks, which is a narrow political orthodoxy suspiciously similar to your own views.Your description of the book is at odds with the reviews I read.  It is not that the author does not say what you'd claim, but as usual usual you are selective in your honesty.Interacting with you 'anti-racist' types is why I say "white guilt" when "liberal guilt" is a more apropos term, and more widely discussed across the political spectrum.  You've made me reinforce race as a concept in my mind with your constant obsession with it, which a point the reviews suggested that book makes.As for your "pretty large circle" that is such nonsense, where to begin?  Most people do not have these campus/Internet-style conversations in real life at all. If you behaved in your Tumblr-sequel way in real life you'd get fired or ostracized by all but like mind SJW ilk. But maybe it sounds like that is the sort of person you hang out with, but there's a reason for characters like PC Principal, because to most people that mentality is zealotry, best laughed at. </comment>

<comment>You're conflating same sex rights with secular and moderate. They correlate but not always. Israel for example or Ghana or even US until recently."People often do not have any real choices in non-Western cultural contexts and yet you leftwing Islam apologists base your ferocious defense of Islam on that false premise, rather than listening to ex- or reform Muslim women who tell you the reality:"This comment is the epitome of white supremacy.I have no guilt for anything, I want justice. Interesting article though, I've never heard of this woman.Not really, I just find it interesting. The term white guilt is generally only something white conservatives use as a slur. Liberal guilt is something I've never heard of. I focus on race because I have black child and a black wife, they face things I'll never face.You would be surprised but many of my Friday night's are with my wife and her black feminist friends, especially if Scandal is on.</comment>

<comment>,  "white supremacy"LOL. I know I hit the mark when you pull that one out. Naturally you have no rational explanation of how listening to women from Muslim backgrounds on gender roles in Islam is "white supremacy," but it makes you sound really radical, I guess.I understand why you are concerned about race, so am I am I oddly enough, but that does not justify your racial essentialization of me and my views. If you want to say the the term "white guilt" is mainly used by conservatives, that's fair.  I'm not a partisan person, so when conservatives are closer to the truth on the rare issue, I'm big enough to acknowledge it. As in the past, you chose to attack me as an Asian for defying your notion as a white person of what a 'real' Asian is like, using the unprovable and unfalisfiable claim of what your friends allegedly say.  I called you out on that.  It especially ridiculous since I know dozens of Asians outside my immediate family who. I know well enough to have some sense of their politics.Same-sex rights and secularism have a huge correlation, not absolute, but logically and politically linked. </comment>

<comment>There are two different philosophies of government being offered: A vaguely libertarian-leaning philosophy of limited government, free(er) trade, and greater individual freedom versus a more communitarian-leaning philosophy of a more paternal kind of government which emphasizes community over individual freedom. The article rather suggests that each of these competing philosophies can or should, only appeal to certain racial, ethnic, or religious groups.  Sorry, my race/ethnicity/religion does not determine my political/philosophical outlook.</comment>

<comment>In many cases they do.For example, ever wonder why the only people who are libertarians tend to be wealthy, white, males?Ever wonder why poor whites vote Republican despite high poverty and death rates in red states? There is much history on this and much of it is due to white supremacy.Ever wonder why black Americans vote Democrat in large numbers despite being socially conservative? Muslims too?I'll say this, the appeal of a small government for the sake of having on is really something that only white Americans seem to love. No black, Hispanic or Asian American seems to give a shit about the size of government like white Americans in my personal experience.</comment>

<comment>Aryans prefer hierarchical and individualistic societies. This is hardwired biologically. The differences between the races is not something that can be politically negotiated. Whites must be outbred or out immigrated.</comment>

<comment>What nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Race doesn't matter? Does anyone really believe that fiction?</comment>

<comment>What counts as "race"?  It was only a handful of decades ago that southern and eastern Europeans didn't count as "white".</comment>

<comment>The actual scientific term Caucasian as listed in the US census which describes a group of people of common ancestry based on measurable and observable physical traits. A definition that remains largely immutable through time.This is opposed to the social (pseudo) science term white. Which can mean different things at different times in different places. This leads to nonsense like 'white Hispanics' or 'racism' against a religion (Islam).My preference for terms that deal in a reality that is defined by an objective order that exists regardless of whether or not I want to believe in it is a defining characteristic of an Aryan.</comment>

<comment>With respect, that is not accurate for anyone who is white and male, which is precisely the problem.For example, strip out for a minute what you actually think about abortion, whether it is good or bad, justified or not. You simply cannot explain Republican policy preferences about abortion in any other way than that they would legislate what happens to women's bodies far more intensely than men's. Now again, for the moment, it doesn't matter whether this legislation is justified, whether it's right. The indisputable point is that they prefer to exert state power on women with far greater scrutiny than they do men.This is a distinction that tracks across gender and racial lines with almost no break. They prefer "liberty" from state interference . . . until the interference in question is police officers shooting black people. In the Democratic party, the Black Lives Matter activists have been hired by the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, where it is understood that the message of BLM is "black lives matter as much as white people". In the Republican party, Black Lives Matter activists have been beaten at Trump rallies because they understand it to mean "Black Lives Matter more than poor whites." And I'm not even getting into just how false your assumption is that the only actor which might decrease your liberty is the state (ask a domestic violence victim sometime whether having a more active police presence would have diminished their liberty).Which explains why your message was nothing but a good encapsulation of party propaganda. When the Republicans take steps to preserve liberty for white men, but are indifferent to the preservation of liberty of groups that are not white men specifically because white men see "liberty" as a zero sum good which they must lose for others to gain, Republicans do not get to claim that their most cherished and sacred belief is greater liberty.</comment>

<comment>>ask a domestic violence victim sometime whether having a more active >police presence would have diminished their libertyIf a battered woman reports to the cops the man is gone. There isn't much of an investigation. Doesn't work that way for a battered man though. And women commit about half of the partner-DV and the vast majority of total DV.</comment>

<comment>Again with respect, you've completely missed my point. The question isn't whether Domestic Violence laws privilege men or women, though your information on DV is . . . mind-bogglingly incorrect. It's whether reducing government involvement by definition increases individual liberty. The original poster takes for granted that reducing government intervention necessarily increases liberty. Because of course it does, if you assume the role of a person who can only be stopped by the government. Which is an assumption that no person who was ever beaten by their parents, only to have the government decide they don't want to be involved (hint: this is an astonishing portion of total abused children) would ever, ever make.If, however, you see "liberty" as something that can be taken away by many actors, only one of whom is the government, you might well make strong, necessary steps to root out such actions by private individuals: not because you preference some value over liberty, but precisely because child abusers diminish their victim's liberty interests. In other words, if you actually care about liberty, then you would advocate taking steps by the state to curb child abuse. But you also rapidly run afoul of movement conservatism, precisely because movement conservatism defines "liberty" in such a way that only the liberty interests of those who need fear only the boot of the government on their neck matters. Which is overwhelmingly white males.</comment>

<comment>My numbers were correct:D Women commit the vast majority of domestic violence toward children, overwhelming men committing 3% more of the DV toward partners.And an important consideration when, as you say, putting the boot of the government on some parent's neck because they yelled at their kid is....how much harm will it do for the kid to be stuffed in a shack in the woods and neglected by someone who views them as a paycheck? Vs staying with their parents?It's hardly clear-cut. And it's not so easy as "don't tolerate it" - because humans aren't perfect, we are not rational actors...or economics would be hard science.</comment>

<comment>I'm not buying that version of the divide. Each party wants more freedom and less government in some areas (the personal and social realms for Democrats, the economic realm for Republicans) and less freedom and more government in others (the inverse). I don't hear too often Republicans wanting to downsize police departments and prisons, for example. Libertarians in the Republican party got drowned out by social conservatives long ago, as have populists in the Democratic party. You need at least two axes to account for most political differences in today's electorate.</comment>

<comment>What this article fails to mention is that the democrats have to lie to get elected to bring about their totalitarian agenda where as the conservatives simply want a small government because we believe in people's ability to make their own decisions on how to live life with minimal input from government. </comment>

<comment>Yeah, yeah. Heard it before. No one who disagrees with your political views can have good intentions or also desire to live in a free society.</comment>

<comment>I care not for intentions, as they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I care about results. </comment>

<comment>That's fascinating. But your prior comment was about intentions and motives.</comment>

<comment>Not at all. I was commenting on what each political party hopes to achieve. </comment>

<comment>Team Red and Team Blue don't get along, what else is new. The American Nations have been deeply divided since the colonial era. Lol </comment>

<comment>... but what this article does not mention is both political parties are as corrupt as the sky is blue. Both parties are controlled by the unseen rich and powerful. Compare the establishment presidential candidates Hillary vs. Jeb! and there is very little difference. All politicians in D.C. stand for the same basic things and can be bought by the highest bidder ...</comment>

<comment>The Clinton campaign in South Carolina is spreading a rumor that Bernie Sanders is a secret Muslim born in Kenya...</comment>

<comment>Yes, demographics tell a lot of the story, but we need to recognize that behind all of that are serious and major disagreements about how the country should be run, how tax money should be spent, how and where wars should be fought, what rights should be and other policy issues with huge implications.The notion that underpins this entire article seems to be that there are only tribes with competing interests, rather than competing ideas.  I find that dangerous.  You don't have to be a poor, urban black man to argue for fairer police and judicial treatment for black males, any more than you need to be a rich white businessman to argue for fewer business regulations.This article just seems to reinforce the problem of tribes over ideas.</comment>

<comment>There are real physical differences between the races including (though hardly limited to) brain structure and hormone levels that influence political affiliations. These differences are uncompromisible. One side just has to win, the other side has to lose. Caucasians are being outbred and out immigrated. Society will have to change in a way that disadvantages them. The highly individualistic and hierarchical society that whites prefer will have to be replaced.</comment>

<comment>This all goes back to the split between big city America and rural or small town America. When Cruz talks about "New York values" he's referring exactly to this split. The culture of places like New York or Los Angeles is closer to the culture of London or Paris than to that of Wyoming or Arkansas. That is a problem, especially for us living far from the coasts, with the cultural and political elites seeking to further the agenda of big city America on detriment of the Heartland. That's why we conservatives are pissed.</comment>

<comment>Even the heartland has cities. Denver is quite cosmopoitan, as are Austin and Minneapolis. And the coasts have our conservative rural hinterlands, like Harney County Oregon, under armed cowboy occupation at the moment. Can't we all just get along? </comment>

<comment>You know very well what I meant. And you know very well there's a political domination of the coasts over the heartland. Don't live in denial.</comment>

<comment>My point is that people living in Minneapolis or Austin or Denver probably have more common intrests politically with people on the coasts than they do with their rural neighbors, and ranchers in eastern Oregon have more in common with Midwest farmers than Portlandiers.As for "domination," the heartland is way over represented in the Senate. 2 California Senators represent the same number of people as 15 heartland states combined, who get 30 senators.</comment>

<comment>And the opposite happens in the House. That you mentioned LIMITS the dominance of big population centers. It sure as hell doesn't eradicate it, and it still doesn't take into account the fact that some states are disproportionally dominated by one or two big cities (Illinois comes to mind).</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately no, rural areas are also over represented in the House. Because so many Democrats are concentrated in cities, REpublicans have better odds in many more districts even though they win fewer actual voters.Just about every state is dominated by one or 2 medium to large cities. Humans are social animals and modern economies depend on proximity.But again, the point is that urban dwellers have more in common with each other than they do with rural dwellers, regardless of where they are in the nation. Atlanta is a very blue place in a very red state. So is Houston.</comment>

<comment>They are not. You know how many of New York's districts are in NYC? And I'm not saying that's unfair, but saying that rural districts are overrepresented is a bold faced lie.</comment>

<comment>>you know very well there's a political domination of the coasts over the heartland.Speaking as a New Yorker, I feel the reverse. Thanks to the electoral college, the House's apportionment rules, and the Senate's by-state representation, a tiny number of rural people can outvote a much larger number of people from cities. (And yes, this includes in the house! http://www.thegreenpapers.com/... )This gives us horrors like the current House Science Committee, composed almost entirely of people who think evolution and global warming don't exist.</comment>

<comment>Bigotry will die out in the Republican Party but I don't think Democrats will ever stop spending.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry to hear that the author is a bigot that judges people based on their ethnicity.Hopefully he can overcome it someday</comment>

<comment>He didn't judge people. He is pointing out how they vote statistically.</comment>

<comment>It would be nice if Republicans modernized a bit and became more receptive to and supportive of minorities, and it would be nice if Democrats could be less beholden to minorities. But since the R party has double down on white fear and grievance in 2016, we will have to wait a while for this transition.It will take a few more presidential spankings before Republicans are ready to embrace the country we are, rather than the one they fondly remember.</comment>

<comment>Our differences are real. Our politics should reflect that.</comment>

<comment>Our differences are not based on melanin and hair or eye color.</comment>

<comment>No, they are based on different sizes of parts of the brain, different hormone levels, and different neural wiring tendencies (instincts).</comment>

<comment>Those are not dependent on melanin either. But keep trying.</comment>

<comment>Those are based on other genetics which have this funny tendency to be passed along with the genetics for melanin and hair and eye color.On an evolutionary timescale they will be passed between populations and will no longer correlate to each other, but that's not going to help them now.</comment>

<comment>There is no evidence for genetic differences that correlate with "race" in any of those.</comment>

<comment>There is plenty of evidence that it is 'heritable' according to rules generally associated with genetics.Which, really, is the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Race does not explain why minorities are left-wing in the United States. Asians tend to be more Democratic in the United States, yet the more right-wing party is dominant in virtually every Asian democracy. And Asians on the West Coast and Hawaii are actually more Republican than whites. Hispanics tend to be more Democratic in the United States, yet there are also many Latin American countries that have elected right-wing governments, especially a decade or two ago, and some Hispanic subgroups like Cubans are also pretty Republican.Minorities are more left-wing in the United States because they, on average, don't have the same economic advantages as white people. And because some parts of the Republican Party consistently make racial attacks against them. If the Republican Party becomes sincerely colorblind, assimilated minority groups would have no trouble voting for them. A great example of this is Muslims--they mostly voted Republican before the 9/11 attacks, and switched Democrat only because the Republicans started supporting racial profiling them.</comment>

<comment>Comparing racial politics in East Asian or European countries where over 90% of the population is indigenous to multicultural America isn't apples to oranges. It's more like comparing apples to beef. </comment>

<comment>Democrats - 2 old white people for presidentRepublicans - Trump - mother from Scotland, Cruz - Cuban father, American mother and was born in Canada,  Rubio - parents are Cuban immigrants, Carson - African American, Fiorina - a  philosophy and medieval history major</comment>

<comment>A women and a Jew (both would be a first), vying to succeed a black man(was the first), counts as the party of white men? You guys are hilarious.Why don't you go demand Cruz's birth certificate? The silver spoon WASP keeps demanding he is not legit.</comment>

<comment>And the Democrats aren't doubling down on minority fear and grievance? Joe Biden telling an audience of black people that Romney wanted to literally "put y'all back in chains"? Hispanic immigrants today have it far easier and see far less discrimination than the Irish and Italian immigrants of a century ago. Most white people in America at this point came from non-English speaking countries, and hear stories of their grandparents coming to America with nothing and being forced to learn English on their own and sharing a room with 8 brothers and sisters, all while not being able to be employed because of their ethnicity. They find it hard to sympathize with new immigrants complaining about things that 95% of the world would be lucky to have.</comment>

<comment>Trump is actually helping by giving Republicans an alternative to the Tea Party and the Establishment.  It's mean and xenophobic, but it's not suicidal like the Tea Party.</comment>

<comment>in 2016 the Democratic Party stands for nothing more than anti-white.</comment>

<comment>Lol another white insecurist with a black avatar.  Don't you wish you had a d*** like him?</comment>

<comment>Classy.</comment>

<comment>OK this is exactly what I said about two months ago to a group of people at dinner abut why the Dems may lose 2016 and they have all stopped speaking to me. See, it takes another liberal/secularist/atheist to see what I was seeing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Get off my lawn.</comment>

<comment>Um, now, that's tolerant.</comment>

<comment>It's also trolling.</comment>

<comment>Republicans, you must reach out to minorities; democrats, you must reach out to Bubbas. We'll all meet in the middle for a group hug.</comment>

<comment>Not going to happen. This nation is broken. Its time to break up. </comment>

<comment>When Congress and the president disagree strongly on what to do, they should do nothing. Political deadlock is a feature, not a bug.</comment>

<comment>This country is fine just as it is.</comment>

<comment>"The Republican coalition doesn’t reflect the growing diversity"Perhaps when your starting point is the most free and prosperous nation in human history diversity can only dilute you with inferior values and culture.</comment>

<comment>Increasing diversity is what made us free and prosperous.  Where would we be today if the anti-immigration no-nothing parties had triumphed in the 19th century.</comment>

<comment>Surely you understand the immigration policy of a new Country of our physical size that only have 7 or 8 million citizens needs to be different from one that has 330 million people, right?  In that era most of our immigrants came from Western Europe and restrictions like the Chinese Exclusion Act didn't hurt us in any discernible way.</comment>

<comment>Our immigration policies are setting this nation up for permanent irreconcilable division. This nation will fall apart and it probably should. Hopefully its peaceful. </comment>

<comment>It won't be, but it will be over real quick.  One side has most of the guns, can aim, and can rather easily identify the other side.</comment>

<comment>They really want to get those guns off us though, don't they?</comment>

<comment>It sure seems like it.  They keep trying to ram through various assault weapons bans even those rifles of every king kill less people every year than blunt objects (hammers, bats, pipes, etc) do.</comment>

<comment>Nice to see someone finally being honest about the right wing's genocidal agenda to impose a totalitarian dictatorship because Jesus and the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>In nations like Nigeria why does this happen? They are divided by religion and tribe. Same in Kenya, Somalia, Sudan, etc.There are plenty of examples that have nothing to do with skin tone. People like you always ignore social cohesion.When Columbus immigrated to the Americas what was the result for the natives? Was the arrival of immigrants a good thing for their culture or not? </comment>

<comment>People like you don't give a rat's behind about social cohesion.  You just want your tribe to dominate everyone and eliminate those who aren't identical to you and/or refuse to conform to your rigid beliefs.  I guess this is what passes for social cohesion in your mind.True social cohesion includes as many people in society as possible and gives everyone a set of shared positive values to work towards.</comment>

<comment>The government is the totalitarian entity that poses the only direct threat to your freedom since it is the means by the lunatics on the left and the right try and impose their schemes and beliefs on you.  I just want to be left alone and to leave everyone else alone to pursue whatever goals don't infringe on the rights of others.</comment>

<comment>Stupid.  America isn't a failed state.  The real guns belong to the government and are loyal to it.</comment>

<comment>We have always had a division between 2 competing values.  The Republicans represent today what the Confederacy represented in the 19th century.  Because we insisted at gunpoint that this will forever be 1 country, we are stuck with these people and their political voice.</comment>

<comment>Good article. Please give us more stuff from excellent journalists like Brownstein, Fallowes, etc. and less of the poorly researched and context-free bloggy stuff</comment>

<comment>YES, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY IS DEAD, FINISHED AND DONE FOR.THEY HATE EVERYONE EXCEPT RICH, OLD white MEN.THEY CANNOT WIN THE PRESIDENCY AND WILL SOON BE IN THE DUSTBIN OF HISTORY.SAY HELLO TO THE WIG PARTY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NOTE: I SUFFER FROM A CYBER STALKER WHO MOCKS ME AND POSTS SOMEHOW UNDER MY NAME AND EVEN USES THE SAME MERRY KWANZA STICKER.PLEASE IGNORE HIM</comment>

<comment>AND YES FOR THOSE WONDERING,  I HAVE NEVER WORKED A JOB IN MY LIFE AND HAVE ALWAYS LIVED ON WELFARE.IN JAIL I MET MY CELL MATE RUFUS WHO TAUGHT ME THAT OBESITY CAN EQUAL A LIFETIME OF WELFARE. .THIS IS MY BUSINESS. </comment>

<comment>All caps.Sure sign of a loony tune.</comment>

<comment>"Eth­nic groups now equal just over 37 per­cent of Amer­ic­ans."Apparently whites are not part of any ethnic groups.</comment>

<comment>Two important political facts are missing from Ron's analysis:First, Republicans have successfully employed aggressive and sometimes illegal tactics --minority voter caging, gerrymandering, bogus "voter fraud" regulations, union busting, phone jamming, etc-- to capture disproportionately greater representation in government than their dwindling numbers merit.Even though Republicans receive far fewer total votes, they end up with more Congressional seats. This tactical success, more than the racial-religious-cultural differences, is why Republicans now control districts outside major urban areas (and therefore Congress).Second, the ideological divide is not symmetrical. Democrats explicitly are the party of pluralism and inclusivity. They welcome people of all racial/ethnic/religious backgrounds and sexual orientation; they champion and celebrate equality for women. As the world becomes more interconnected and America more diverse, Democrats thrive.Republicans don't want pluralism and diversity; they want cumpulsory Christian prayer and creationism in public schools, a militarized wall on the southern border, "voluntary deportation," English-Only ordinances, subservient "helpmate" wives, the right to discriminate against gays, and a ban on Muslim immigrants. They name a Senate chamber after Strom Thurmond, celebrate Confederate "heritage," think Obama must be a secret Muslim born in Kenya, and pine for the simpler, Whiter days before the Civil Rights Movement.Ideologically, Republicans are thus incapable of finding common ground or bridging any divide. They are an exclusionary party of racial and religious identity, explicitly seeking to deny non-whites, gays, Muslims, women, immigrants, etc, equal opportunity and status in America.</comment>
