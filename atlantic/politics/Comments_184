<comment>Common Core was an awful idea.  Whoever made up those standards never spent time in an actual classroom.</comment>

<comment>It was created by state education people, and teachers. I just read through a few of the published standards, and they make sense.  I'm not a teacher but did get an engineering degree, and work within my industry's standards.Here's one of the standards from High School Algebra:Interpret expressions that represent a quantity in terms of its context.*CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSA.SSE.A.1.AInterpret parts of an expression, such as terms, factors, and coefficients.CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSA.SSE.A.1.BInterpret complicated expressions by viewing one or more of their parts as a single entity. For example, interpret P(1+r)n as the product of P and a factor not depending on P.CCSS.MATH.CONTENT.HSA.SSE.A.2Use the structure of an expression to identify ways to rewrite it. For example, see x4 - y4 as (x2)2 - (y2)2, thus recognizing it as a difference of squares that can be factored as (x2 - y2)(x2 + y2).</comment>

<comment>The Common Core Math Standards are awful and have caused children to hate math and break into tears.  They don't teach the normal way of doing math problems to children in lower grades now, like memorizing multiplication tables.  Apparently, parents are supposed to teach their children the correct way to do math at home instead.  http://www.theatlantic.com/nat...I was talking to some Middle School teachers about a month ago and they do not teach their students grammar rules, spelling, or vocabulary anymore.  Lots of literature has been removed and replaced with dry non-fiction reading.And this is before we get to the testing, which has apparently caused third graders to have ulcers and led children to burst into tears.  There is such a backlash against that in places like NYC and New Jersey that the legislature has apparently forbade schools from keeping the test on the children's permanent records or using the tests for grade level promotion.My mom used to be a teacher and she said that the teachers she know uniformly despise Common Core.</comment>

<comment>I've seen some of these new math methods helping my step-kids with their homework.  But those common core standards are not teaching methods, they're written out concepts that should be learned at each grade level.  Blaming a set of standards without actually reading them is just lazy.Same with literature.  There's nothing that says they have to read this specific book:Integration of Knowledge and Ideas:CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.7.7Compare and contrast a written story, drama, or poem to its audio, filmed, staged, or multimedia version, analyzing the effects of techniques unique to each medium (e.g., lighting, sound, color, or camera focus and angles in a film).CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.7.8(RL.7.8 not applicable to literature)CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.RL.7.9Compare and contrast a fictional portrayal of a time, place, or character and a historical account of the same period as a means of understanding how authors of fiction use or alter history.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  We can definitely blame the teaching methods and tests on Common Core.  Sorry.  As someone with stepchildren, I would expect you to be up in arms about the changes.  My understanding is that most parents are.And children should have to read specific books and should be encouraged to read Great American and British Literature.  They should also learn how to spell, learn grammar rules, and learn multiplication tables.</comment>

<comment>When a standard I work with says something like "a component used for purpose X must exceed 3 times the expected maximum load", that's not telling me how to meet the standard.When another standard says that in grade 7 students should be able to compare and contrast literature to it's movie version, it's not saying which book/movie has to be compared.Yes, rote memorizing of multiplication tables has value.  But critical thinking is needed more in today's job market than it was even when I was in high school (20+ years ago).</comment>

<comment>You cannot get to critical thinking if you do not understand the basics.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  I am dumbfounded how critics deride tests as being too basic and that we should teach higher level skills that often depend upon the skills that students are weak.</comment>

<comment>It is mostly dumb people from Red states that are up in arms about 'Common Core'.  Blue states already have high standards are superior educational outcomes, so there is little to no resistance there.  Red states dont like that the insufficiency of their systems is made so clear in comparison.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>You mean the dumb people in the red state of New York and the red city of NYC who are against the testing.  There is a huge opt out movement in New York.  http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08...</comment>

<comment>Memorize multiplication tables?  Seriously?  That really has basically no place in 2015.  If you think we should hold onto that your stuck in the past and any teacher that thinks they're doing students a favor isn't doing them any and should just retire. Mindless rote memorization of that sort serves little purpose as you can eliminate most of that table learning basic algebra.  Even in a precalculator world it was silly, but it is even sillier now.  Putting a fork in multiplication tables is a **good** thing.</comment>

<comment>So should nine year olds be using calculators then?  I think making kids work through basic math the old fashioned way is a good thing.  Kids should also be taught basic spelling and grammar.</comment>

<comment>No, I don't see the need to give 9 year olds calculators.  I think mindless memorization of multiplication tables was arguably silly even in a world without calculators because you can eliminate most of the table.  If you are memorizing even half the table you are wasting time that could be better used for higher level skills.  I know adults who know 144 values by heart, but the moment you leave that table they're clueless.  29x31 might as well be rocket science even though it is easy to do in one's head.  That's NOT good.</comment>

<comment>Need the table to do the longer process.</comment>

<comment>Right, which is why they cannot figure out how much 4 of anything will cost them.Testing is despised because it shows lac of knowledge - basic and otherwise.And now the door is open to elimination of the education for the poor.Which is what it is all about.</comment>

<comment>Strange because I know **tons** of adults that went to school before NCLB who can't multiple virtually anything if any number is above 12.  Your example of the cost of 4 items would get a deer in the headlights look at what's 4x8.99 because that's NOT on the multiplication table.  Ask them what 29x31 is and without a calculator they're clueless even though it is very simple.  I'd rather kids actually learn basic properties of multiplication than mindlessly remember 144 numbers.  The US education system has never done awesome teaching math, but holding onto multiplication tables isn't going to improve math in America.</comment>

<comment>Arne Duncan's demand that racial quotas be implemented in school disicipline is a good example on why the power of the Secretary of Ed needed to be restricted. </comment>

<comment>Why didn't the republicans do this the last 7 years? Work in a bipartisan way but still take your small talking point victories were they could. What a different political landscape it would be here.</comment>

<comment>I am irrationally optimistic that Duncan's willingness to limit the power of the secretary stems from wanting to bring education back to the states and districts, and out of the hand of the national government. If he was handcuffed into giving up this power by Congress, then we will end up right back where we started </comment>

<comment>Get your kids out of red state schools quickly...particularly deep south states like Mississippi and Arkansas.</comment>

<comment>Every teacher I know hated NCLB. I'm in favor of standards, but I am glad this is gone.</comment>

<comment>It was too ambitious.  They should have just left it as "Some Children Left Behind."</comment>

<comment>Glad to see this over-emphasis on testing is being reduced.  My Kindergartener was subject to test after test after test.  A once a year 2 hour federal test would have been good as long it was just about tracking ... not rewards.  I simply ask "what was so bad about the way I was educated some decades ago?"</comment>
