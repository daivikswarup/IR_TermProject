<comment>Reinstate the draft. This provides a constant supply of mixed talent from which the more capable leaders can be identified. </comment>

<comment>I don't think conscript based armies will be very effective in future conflicts.More importantly, vast majority of Americans are disqualified from military service, according to the article.  So even if they were drafted, they would simply be sent home immediately from the recruiting office.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but currently, we are trying to man the force with the small percentage of people qualified and willing to show up. It's necessarily a small pool of people. I'd automatically reinstate the Draft once a certain number of personnel are deployed, to try to ensure dwell time for troops who need it. </comment>

<comment>Modern soldiers need lots of training and accumulate considerable knowledge, so a backbone of long-service NCOs and a base of soldiers on 4-6-year enlistments is essential to maintaining quality.Draftees in past wars performed bravely, and after a few battles the survivors generally performed competently, but it was a far cry from the performance we see and expect today.</comment>

<comment>This is really an assertion that lacks proof, and to the extent that it can or has been tested, is wrong.  Case in point, WWII naval aviation.  Prior to WWII, the Japanese picked and trained a super-elite of naval aviators, and then used their war in China to give them combat experience.  The result was on the eve of Pearl Harbor, they had the best naval aviators in the world, with an average of over 700 hours of training before being allowed to fly combat.  We were at around 300 hours in our best units.  The problem was that the Japanese force was comparatively small and the returns they got on this training, past a certain point, was not enough to offset a larger and steadily growing force of competent - and better than average - enemies:  US naval aviators.  Once the Japanese force was broken, it was impossible to recreate.  The Brits had an analogous experience with their small, all-volunteer army in the opening part of WWI.If our forces fight competent, numerically large enemies in a sustained war, the all-volunteer force will be bled dry in no short order and soon need draftees.  Wastage in war is enormous.  The current force has fought a succession of 3rd and 4th rate enemies that it has failed to defeat.  It has been touted as the best-educated force we'd ever fielded.  There's a moral in all of that.</comment>

<comment>It is certainly true that quantity has a quality of its own, but our peacetime military has to be based on long-service volunteers.  We need a plan to expand and sustain the military in wartime, but we also need to understand that there is not a bright line between war and peace.Draftees do best in wars with massive popular support, so costs are easier to manage.  In World War II, we needed to expand quickly enough that it was acceptable to send troops into battle with a modicum of training, knowing that some would become casualties, but that the survivors would be smarter.  We bought experience in blood in North Africa, Guadalcanal, Dieppe, etc., paying prices that would not be politically acceptable in modern limited wars.Our success or failure in modern limited wars has been largely a function of strategic considerations, not tactical proficiency.  We've suffered roughly 5,000 dead in Iraq in a decade of fighting; an emotionally significant number, but militarily minuscule.  We lost almost 7,000 Marines on Iwo Jima in about a month, and the survivors were reallocated for follow-on operations, so the military can survive incredible casualties when the strategic goals are clear.</comment>

<comment>Those are largely fair points.  Keep in mind that the conscript forces have always been the exception, not the norm.  The core of our forces in the World Wars were the peacetime professional career, volunteer military.  And the men who stayed in during the interwar period, when promotion was glacial, pay was low, and the nation was indifferent, were the men who anticipated the major WWII innovations and got the strategy right.  It also placed a high value on professional military education, something not true of the current force.  The entire structure and ethos and outlook of the old volunteer military was quite a bit different than that of the new one.I'd agree that our recent failures are strategic not tactical, but I'd also note that our tactics haven't actually gotten a real test either because we're not fighting first rate enemies.</comment>

<comment>"The current force has fought a succession of 3rd and 4th rate enemies that it has failed to defeat."Maybe, we should choose better wars. Winning hearts and mines is different than blowing everyone up.</comment>

<comment>Are "defeating the enemy" and "winning wars" the true objectives of the US military?  Or, are the true objectives recruiting the enemy and increasing its own bloated budget?  Based on results, I would say the latter are correct.  Based on observed tactics and strategies, I come to the same conclusion.There is a huge emperor's clothes problem here.</comment>

<comment>Vietnam War joke:1. First, we put our South Vietnamese allies on rafts in the South China Sea.2. Next, we carpet bomb North and South Vietnam with B-52s, pave over both countries and make them into one giant parking lot.3. We sink the rafts.That's the kind of war our military is designed to fight. Destroy everything and everyone with massive firepower. We weren't worried about collateral damage when we fire bombed Dresden and Tokyo.However, the U.S. military doesn't seem to have the strategy or tactics to win a limited war, with limited objectives in a reasonable amount of time. Perhaps, it's an impossible task for a democracy.</comment>

<comment>"Winning hearts and mines."   I like that.  I'll remember that the next time I am out in the mindfields.</comment>

<comment>Freudian slip. I meant winning hearts "with" mines. ;-)</comment>

<comment>Recruiting isn't the problem.  What will the draft do to fix retention?  That's what the story is about.</comment>

<comment>If we try another very high manpower set of wars, retention becomes a problem. Many people in my peer group did not stay past one term, because they didn't desire to do ten combat deployments. Two or three seemed sufficient.</comment>

<comment>So what will the draft fix?  Retention will still be the problem.</comment>

<comment>I walked away and realized I may have misunderstood your intent.  Are you saying that if we had a greater number of people from 2003-now, then fewer people would be getting out because there would have been a more equitable sharing of time in the ME?Because when I look at my peers, I can see most have one to two years, total time, deployed.  I'm into my fourth year now. (Count years, not deployments.  Not all "deployments" are the same length).The Army at least, wasn't able to ensure that everyone shared the same amount of time in the ME, for various reasons.So, again, now that the wars are pretty much done, what will a draft do about retention today?</comment>

<comment>Nothing. I would just trigger it next time we ramp up to that much deployment time. </comment>

<comment>Weren't we at full capacity in the forces?  The issue was that Congress never expanded expanded the capacity and when they did, recruiting had no problem bringing the people in.  The real problem was they recruited everyone with a pulse which led to problems until about 2011 or so.  But the draft would have brought in the same type of people.I've always wanted to see the deployment stats.  As I said, I know many people who spent only 6 months to 24 months in zone.  And many of them spent it in Kuwait.</comment>

<comment>Also, isn't it true that only enlisted people are drafted? Officers, which is who this article is concerned with, would still need to volunteer.</comment>

<comment>Why can't you pick promising recruits or NCOs for OCS?</comment>

<comment>Because the odds are, if Vietnam was any indication, is most draftees won't want to be there and will serve their tour and get out immediately.  The best and the brightest will find a way around the draft, and we will be right back where we are now, except for a lot of people pissed at congress for making them serve when they didn't want to.</comment>

<comment>The context is different now. And I said "recruits", not "draftees" about whom you are correct.If a smart officer or even top sergeant spots a smart, savvy recruit or newer noncom, that person should indeed be considered for OCS. Not all college educated or Academy grads make good officer while some noncoms do.As for finding  a way around the draft, that certainly is Vietnam stuff. The whole thing was designed to keep the middle and, especially, upper middle classes out. If we're going to do a draft it should be for national service, not military only. And no exceptions, especially the upper tiers. We don;t need a military that large just like we don;t need 2400, crappier-by-the-month  F-35s to fight off the Warsaw Pact..</comment>

<comment>Because they have to be volunteers.</comment>

<comment>No rule that says an officer or M Sgt can't make a suggestion or offer. </comment>

<comment>You would find that the "standards" are quickly revised if a draft was re-instated.</comment>

<comment>Edward Snowden has demonstrated what you are likely to get with a conscripted force that fails to screen out those with opposing scruples.  Restart a draft, and you can be reasonably assured that a thousand Snowdens will quickly bloom.</comment>

<comment>Really, why would you draft people into the Service Academies?? They are the most competitive colleges in the country!</comment>

<comment>They are - and probably will continue to be so, even if only because doing a 4-6 year commitment beats the hell out of being stuck paying student loans for the majority of your adult life. That, and the other way to look at that 'commitment' is 'guaranteed job on graduation' (in the military).The problem here isn't getting people in though - it's retention, aka keeping them in.</comment>

<comment>most of the academy grads I knew put in early out paperwork while still in the basic course. Their attitude was that they had already "served" while at the academy.</comment>

<comment>which is one reason why academy grads often have a bad reputation among ROTC and OCS commissioned officers</comment>

<comment>What era are you talking about? I was an instructor 2 different times at the basic and advanced courses and never saw this. The only time I did was immediately following Desert Storm when there was no restriction.</comment>

<comment>I guess I should be anonymous so can I say between 95 and 99? Also, I really only know that they were talking about it a lot. Its not like I actually saw the paperwork or if they all got approved. I only ever kept in touch with 3 of them and they were out after 2 years. I felt that it was the prevalent attitude among them but I will caveat that with the top of my class was a pointer and so was the bottom so all generalizations fail when applied to an individual.</comment>

<comment>In case you hadn't heard, it's not a 4-6 year commitment anymore.  It's 8 years now.  That's the problem with some people --  still fighting the last war.</comment>

<comment>It's always been that way - but those 8 years aren't "8 years of mandatory active duty." Even people enlisting have that 8 year commitment, but they may have only signed up for 3 or 4 years of active duty.The thing is that they can recall you at any time during that 8 year period for the needs of the service, which happened all the time during the Iraq War, to where you basically had to expect that it was likely to happen. I did 6 years of active duty, and opted to go into the National Guard after finishing on active duty,  since the alternative was just getting plucked up and tossed into a random unit.Were it not for that, you just get off active duty, and are otherwise free to go about your civilian life normally, unless they ask you to come in for some reason.</comment>

<comment>Actually no, it hasn't always been that way.  During the Vietnam war and for some time afterward, a military service obligation commitment was a "burst of six" (years).   In theory, you could sometimes get away with as little as 18 months of active duty and the rest uneasily skating in the IRR or something similar, hoping not to be called back.   But I knew of people who were extended long beyond even the 6-year commitment they had agreed to,  so it helps to read the fine print and the statutes.</comment>

<comment>I meant more that it hasn't changed since they made the switch to the volunteer force, as opposed to having been some recent (OEF/Iraq war era) change.And yes, it's important to read what you're signing. There were a lot of very unhappy people that had forgotten about that 8 year bit, thinking they were only signed up for 3-4 years, that wound up with a rude awakening.Also, if I understand correctly, officers have to put in paperwork to request to get out, as opposed to enlisted who have a specific date they're going to be finished unless they reenlist or are otherwise involuntarily extended.And if you're a general officer, you serve at the pleasure of the president and can be called back at any time for the rest of your life. :)</comment>

<comment>I truly *emotionally* (from a guilt-ridden perspective: long story) get this, and I understand why: politicians would be less reckless with the lives of American boys if their own were risk. But that's not how it'll work in practice. What is going to happen if the draft were reinstated is that the well-connected kid will get a nice desk or soup kitchen job while the kid who doesn't ends up sweating it out in a night fire-fight. And that's if you can force them in somehow, which in the 21st Century among the "Snowden Generation" is going to be no pushover task to say the least.Nixon, cynical calculating bastard though he was, did the right thing. The US military actually has become a lot more tactically effective since the draft days since the soldiers are usually a lot more motivated. This tends to be obscured by our horrific foreign policy decisions, but it's true when you compare your average soldier in Iraq vs. Vietnam. No fraggings, no race riots, no drug abuse, soldiers actually go after the enemy, and the casualty rate (even taking into account the different scale of the conflict) is way down because the infantry is more skilled. The difference is literally night and day. </comment>

<comment>"What is going to happen if that happens is that the well-connected kid will get a nice desk or soup kitchen job while the kid who doesn't ends up sweating it out in a night fire-fight."I've heard the expression "US Army liaison to Naval operations in Colorado" before.</comment>

<comment>I used to deploy overseas to Camp Smith all the time.(Camp Smith is in Hawai'i.)</comment>

<comment>yeah. Camp Smith the long journey on the Like Like "interstate" and the uphill struggle to the parking lot. now if you got stuck in area xray infested with disease bearing mosquitos that the Army brought in just to test the effectiveness of our vaccines, I might actually have winced in sympathy.</comment>

<comment>There is a US Navy presence in Colorado because of some of their operations at Schriever, Buckley, PAFB, Fort Carson, etc.,  and previously at CMAFS, among others.</comment>

<comment>This is about retention of people. Not recruiting.  Recruiting is doing fine.  Retention is the concern here.</comment>

<comment>"No fraggings, no race riots, no drug abuse..."Who are you kidding?  When was the last time you had the boots and the battle-rattle on?   Because those are very real features in the services today, despite the lack of competent reporting and frequent headlines.</comment>

<comment>There is a reason why we and most modern nations stopped the draft; you wind up forcing people to join who don't have an interest in being there or wanting to fight. Furthermore, since the draft tends to affect minorities, the poor, and the uneducated more, you'll wind up getting lower quality and talented people.Also, considering that the military has high levels of training using technical and sophisticated equipment, the costs would be astronomical, training all of these people to use them.</comment>

<comment>You would obtain a good cross section of every youth was drafted or otherwise had to serve in some capacity. Boot camp would be good for the obese.</comment>

<comment>"Astonishingly, almost three-quarters of Americans from age 17 to 25 are disqualified from serving in uniform due to obesity, education, criminal records, or medical reasons."There is such a thing as being too fat to fightETA: IIRC, the issue is that to graduate from boot, you must have achieved a minimum level of fitness. You may be able to shoot the wings off a mosquito from half a mile, but if you can't run far enough, fast enough, you get to do the whole trip over again. Obese recruits might require 2 or more passes through boot, and that would result in clogging up the system. It's just not worth the military's time to thin these people down.</comment>

<comment>This why JROTC should be a federal program. The same way cadets are in Canada. You stimulate interest in the armed forces. Train the kids to be fit. Develop leadership. It pays out in quantity and quality of recruits. Even the cadets that don't end up in the Armed Forces have a better appreciation of what they do and are more likely to support them.</comment>

<comment>No, I didn't serve 29 yrs in the Army to see my children forced to take military training at the H.S. level. A year in college? I can agree with that.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and the rich, well connected, and educated will get cushy, easy positions and be out in a year, never to return, or just defer and defer and defer until they're no longer eligible which is pretty much what happened when we did have the draft.The obese aren't eligible to join the military due to basic physique requirements. If you're saying drop and eases those requirements then that drives home my point and lessens yours about quality and talent issues.</comment>

<comment>Please explain how minorities, poor, and the uneducated are more affected.  Selective Service registration happens when a person registers to vote and, last I checked, it was those very groups that had so much trouble registering.  One of these two things has to be untrue, and considering how many articles The Atlantic has run about the claimed unconstitutionality of voter registration, I'd say you're on the hook to prove otherwise.</comment>

<comment>I'm not on the hook to prove well known facts. Google is your friend.</comment>

<comment>Selective Service has nothing to do with voting. And you have to register by law, even if you're a noncitizen and can't vote. Many states also require registration for getting a driver's license or financial aid.</comment>

<comment>Actually, Selective Service registration can only be done via 3 primary avenues - 1. Post Office2. Military Recruiting Office3. High School when recruiters visit for ASVAB day if those taking the test are already over 18 years of age at the time it is administered</comment>

<comment>I registered online.</comment>

<comment>Which isn't complete until you actually sign the form & mail it in. Registering online is merely an extra step in the process.</comment>

<comment>That may be the dumbest thing posted on this article.  You havent served, or you would understand why that is a horrible idea.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>They won't do it, because the last time there was a draft the army more or less mutinied en masse against its terrible leadership. Fragging was the last time officers faced any accountability, and they don't want those days back.</comment>

<comment>This country was founded on freedom. The draft is the opposite of that.</comment>

<comment>Bad idea. First, the issue here isn't the lack of capable, talented leaders, it's a promotion system that doesn't recognize them the way the civilian sector can. Second, involuntary military service is repugnant. I'm a vet. I joined because I wanted to. I've always thought that if the country doesn't have a cause worthy enough for people to voluntarily defend, then it's not worth defending.</comment>

<comment>... and have much less money per recruit? Good thinking.</comment>

<comment>B/S! The draft was a colossal failure. You CANNOT force people to fight & die for military adventurism, all designed to support a corrupt Congressional, Military, Industrial Complex.America must learn to think out-of-the-box & realize that what we have been doing for the past 240 years or so will NOT see us through the 21st century & beyond.I would submit that we need to create "State Militias," controlled in their entirety by the individual state & not subject to federal call out.All persons ages 16-60 would be required to serve in the State Militia in some capacity as qualified, with no exceptions. Service would lead to free state education, either technical or university as tested & the State's Militia would serve that state in various functions, to include actual protection, whether against an armed invasion, borders, conservation, & civil functions.Persons who enjoyed this State Militia lifestyle could then volunteer for Federal Service, which also needs a major overhaul into "Functional Areas," eventually returning to their State Militia upon the end of their Federal Service contract.This would be a win-win solution for everyone, as we would eventually see our youth in better shape, more civic minded & aware, much better educated & employable, & developed into much better citizens with a love for THEIR state in support of OUR country...</comment>

<comment>I can agree with the idea of national service but not exclusively military.  The country simply does not need that many men and women in military uniform.</comment>

<comment>Keeping leaders is the problem, not recruiting.  Once identified, how would you force people to stay in?</comment>

<comment>Rather than the draft, let's have Universal Military Training so we don't have college students like those at Kent St. who were so stupid they attacked armed soldiers, National Guard.</comment>

<comment>Russia has a conscript army which it trusts to do--pretty much nothing.  Its wars are actually fought by a core of professionals.But it still has to pay to feed, house, cloth and equip that huge cadre of minimally-useful draftees, who leave the army none the better for their service (in both senses).We should do this too?</comment>

<comment>Why? The article was about how to retain, not identify, highly qualified military personnel.In addition, in a country where so many oppose the government and where no one wants to pay their taxes, what's the justification for forcing people to serve in the military?Finally, the "best and the brightest", by their own estimation, didn't serve during the last draft. They were doing missionary work in France, working on political campaigns, going to med school, or obtaining law degrees.</comment>

<comment>The problem with draftees is that some of them think like law abiding adults.  The US military wants obedient killers.</comment>

<comment>I recently visited West Point. Interesting place with a vast history, but over the past seventy years the US had a poor record of winning wars (or conflicts).</comment>

<comment>Not really. WWII, Korea, and the First Gulf War were handled pretty well and can be considered victories in that we accomplished the established goals, as were a fair amount of the more "minor" operations.That being said, it's artillery and airpower that gives the US the fighting advantage, and it was the case in WWII as well. Not what you'll see in a Spielberg movie with the American infantry outclassing everyone. And compared to the Wehrmacht or the Red Army, we had it easy.</comment>

<comment>WW II ended 70 years ago and was not included in my comment.</comment>

<comment>Calling Korea a victory is a stretch. Yes, South Korea was liberated. But it was also the last war in which the USA was forced to retreat, and the USA settled for a ceasefire instead of winning.If GW1 had resulted in the liberation of Kuwait, but Iraqi forces had beaten the USA back into SA resulting in a negotiated ceasefire, would that have been a victory?</comment>

<comment>I classify it as such because we came closer to achieving our goals than the enemy did, same as the Gulf.</comment>

<comment>Your assessment of what a victory is is horribly flawed at best.  Retreat has nothing to do with victory and the fact that North Korea did not sign a peace treaty doesnt mean a damn thing.  We had our objective in Korea, we achieved it and a satellite picture of the Korean peninsula proves my point.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Really, the question isn't one of strength of arms - it's more of policy, because every time the U.S. military is given a clear set of goals that are militarily achievable, we've seen success.The problem comes when the goals are not militarily achievable, or not even military in the first place - like "pacify an entire civilian population of a mostly hostile country in full insurrection supported by outside powers" or "rebuild a functioning society from the ground up amid chaos and insurrection".</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Even in failed wars, specific operations are usually successful if clear, concise, strategically intelligent, and realistic politically. Case in point: Operation Linebacker or snuffing out Zarqawi.However, tactical success means nothing without political results. The methods that would truly crush an insurgency, especially in a Muslim country, would make any state that attempted them anathema today. Even the Russians have toned it down. Thus, there are extreme limits on what force can achieve in 2015.</comment>

<comment>Agreed - Iraq was a political loss, and it was lost by the incompetency of the civilian appointees (especially Bremer first and foremost, but there were many others), that began long before the first shot of the war.</comment>

<comment>The Brits used to do it all the time, including in Iraq. If your army can only win narrow tactical victories, it's a bad army.</comment>

<comment>The Brits didn't do it with a hostile power positioned right on the other side of a porous border freely supplying weapons.The Brits also excelled at the political level of managing the conflicts.</comment>

<comment>They played a role in the complete collapsing of Russia/USSR without firing one nuke. Id say thats pretty good of ya ask me.</comment>

<comment>the brits did a lot of things that are no longer acceptable under LOAC.</comment>

<comment>Most of Britain's colonial dirty work wasn't military at all - for the largest empire in history, Britain has generally had a tiny standing army. France was routinely fielding armies twice or three times the size.The British excelled at political and economic manipulation - installing puppets, playing regional powers against each other using its massive navy to choke and strong-arm the right people.Why send your boys across the world to die when a corrupt Maharajah will do it for you for the price of a Rolls Royce and an army's worth of muskets?</comment>

<comment>But there always was a military component. They just had an actual strategy - war as a continuation of policy by other means, and all that - whereas we just think of the army as a tool to blow stuff up. And even when it was purely military, they were much better at it; their "Vietnam/Iraq" was the Boer War, and they won that in two years, rebuilt a functioning society at record pace, and had essentially no further problems. Thirteen years later South Africans were fighting alongside Brits in WWI; coming up on thirteen years later on Iraq, and we're practically back where we started. </comment>

<comment>All those conflicts were more or less skirmishes in the Cold War, which the US won handily and without nuclear annihilation.  </comment>

<comment>I thought Germany and Japan won.</comment>

<comment>It depends on if you are talking about a military victory or a political victory. Two totally different goals.</comment>

<comment>Well if it's an acronym, it must be true, right? The fact is that the conflicts we just finished (?) fighting required an abundance of clear thought and quick decision-making on the part of small-unit infantry leaders, to an extent that is pretty unique in the history of modern warfare.As a result, your average Marine infantryman is smarter than even your above-average undergrad; if only because the former has enough emotional wherewithal not to crumple under the crushing pressure of an Econ 101 final.</comment>

<comment>If I were hiring for a job I would take an experienced enlisted Marine infantryman over just about any university undergrad any day of the week. They are far more intelligent, well trained, and most have a hard-won grounding in resourcefulness and determination that will simply not be found in the average college student.</comment>

<comment>Um no, the Marine Corps is the idiot service.  Any other service would be preferable over a Marine.  Thinking is definately not one of the things that Marines are selected or trained for.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Spoken like someone who has only ever read about Marines and never met one.</comment>

<comment>I agree. The stereotype of the dumb jarhead is largely wrong.For decades the Army has had the lowest IQ-equivalent scores among the military branches (though it's still over 100). This is not surprising, as the Army is the largest branch and most liable to a regression to the mean.</comment>

<comment>And yet I still would not belittle the skills and abilities of a soldier. On the whole I put them above most civilian demographics.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't, either. As I said, over 100.</comment>

<comment>I was in the Air Force back in the Eighties. Having been stationed in Okinawa and Korea (among other places), I had the opportunity to know a lot of marines and soldiers. The Jarheads were smarter by far.</comment>

<comment>You are incorrect.  I was raised by Marines and met a great many of them in my time in the service and since.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>So you're saying you were raised by idiots?Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Everything you have said on this thread is either dumb, nonsensical, or false; as a former Marine, I'm going to go ahead and take this assertion as a compliment.</comment>

<comment>Dont mind William Diaz, he is one of the 72% who cant meet the basic qualifications.</comment>

<comment>The fact that you are willing to take time out of your day to come on here, create an account, log in, and read an article simply to insult Marines is quite sad. Haven't you anything else better to do? Obviously not, you go out of your way to cast insults in order to feel better about your sad, pathetic, and lonely life. You are one sad, sad, MoFo</comment>

<comment>Truthtellah...  every enlisted Marine is comparably smarter then you tellah... because as soon as AK47 fire would be heading in your direction ... your intelligence would be neutralized as you crumble to a fetal position & crap your pants...</comment>

<comment>There are lots of smart people in the armed forces.</comment>

<comment>This is not true in the slightest.</comment>

<comment>80-90% percent of officers have a BA, as commissioned officers in the military are required to have one. 95% of enlisted soldiers have their HS Diploma and GED versus 60% of the general population.</comment>

<comment>And then they're required to continue in their education as they progress.  Besides the internal training programs (BDE, IDE, SDE for officers), personnel are required to continue their higher education if they want to progress.  I'm not aware of many people who make E-7 without a Bachelor's or O-4 without a Master's.</comment>

<comment>All of that is complete and absolute bullshit ticket punching with no real relationship to education or intellectual capacity.  Most of those master's degrees are jokes, earned to check a box on a form rather than a real commitment to education and personal development.That isnt my opinion, but that of the most decorated US soldier until his death in 2005.  Read 'About Face' and hold a seance if you want to argue the point.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>The students at the Naval War College who spend several hours a night studying to pass their weekly evaluations might say otherwise.</comment>

<comment>The fact that people in the military pursue post-grad studies just to check a box while serving on active duty should say something about just how trivial it is for them.  You've just made your opposition's point.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, but I believe he is right. There certainly are officers who engage in serious, rigorous graduate and post-graduate study. But there are also many officers who receive check-the-box degrees. I have many officer friends with just such degrees, and even they admit it is a joke.</comment>

<comment>The Different branches of the military have their views.  Right now, higher education is valued, but not a discriminator for promotion.  That's going to change soon as the military continues to down size.</comment>

<comment>Ever heard of cyberwarfare?  Military intelligence?  Nuclear power engineering?  Aircraft maintenance?  The military is a whole lot smarter than the population at large.</comment>

<comment>Incorrect.  Most military personnel are in support roles, even including those serving in "combat arms".  As an example, most infantry NCOs and officers spend most of their time organizing training events, preparing the unit for incoming and departing staff, maintaining equipment, resolving HR issues, preparing readiness reports, attending S2 (intel) briefings, etc.</comment>

<comment>Intel is the biggest career field in the military.  You probably didn't know that since they're mostly staffing NSA, CIA, DIA, and other brainiac organizations right alongside their civilian peers who were cherry-picked from the Ivy League.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that support roles outnumber combat roles 4-1</comment>

<comment>Says the guy that is part of the 72% who cant qualify.</comment>

<comment>Your bigotry is showing.</comment>

<comment>The way the military is structured, if you want a language job, you need to go enlisted. I did. Jost would have been good as a Foreign Area Officer, but these slots are extremely competitive, and dominated by combat arms. But yes, six weeks of maternity leave is unworkable. Although it is paid, which is better than civilian standards, but civilians can take as long as they want, unpaid. To leave with an option to return, as well as making sure there's slots for specialists in Reserve units would both be good ideas. </comment>

<comment>Yep - and then go into the military's technical/subject matter expert branch, where you very well *can* continue doing your same job, be it intelligence or helicopter pilot - become a Warrant Officer.</comment>

<comment>Warrant is where it is at. </comment>

<comment>These days a Warrant is just a commissioned officer with a smaller paycheck.</comment>

<comment>I'm calling BS on that!  I once accidentally spied the battalion LES statements when I was a senior first lieutenant.  The warrant paystubs I saw were bigger than mine!!</comment>

<comment>That's because you had 6 months time in service and the Warrant had 20 years. My paycheck as an E8 was bigger than your as well.</comment>

<comment>Not all services or branches have warrant officers.  The USAF has none, the Navy and Marines use them for ex-senior NCO technical leaders; only the Army uses them in direct-entry capacity, and that is only for helicopter pilots.All services need to expand their warrant ranks and provide a technical career path for officers off the command track, if only to save on training costs for aviators, engineers, special operators, etc.  There are lots of fields where forcing someone out just to make room for a new nugget is prohibitively expensive.</comment>

<comment>All the FAOs I've met have been career officers with great promise that could no longer function in whatever physically demanding job they had been in due to injury (mostly pilots with a SF CGO or two sprinkled in).  It's not a job you start out in; it's a job you're relegated to when you're broken but still valuable.</comment>

<comment>The percentage of US youth both interested in and able to join the military is pretty small these days.It's also getting worse from the inside. The truly disturbing part of it is that military "tradition" families are often encouraging their own kids to not go in these days.</comment>

<comment>it  doesn't help that job listings in and around the federal gov't are completely indecipherable from the outside world.LDF TS/SCI CWMD sought at MD SOC com in CONUS and OCONUS.

<comment>If you can't decipher that, it's a pretty good indication that you are not qualified for the position.</comment>

<comment>You say that as if people outside the military world use these acronyms. Probably 90% of them are U.S.-government-specific acronyms for single-system implementations of common software.    It would be like installing Microsoft Office and referring to it as "our MSO/TDDP-QRV2 system" Which is probably why the military (and its contractors) have such a difficult time recruiting people out of the private sector.Oh, and for the record, I made a few of those acronyms up.   So it's safe to say you aren't in a position to determine who is qualified and who is not.</comment>

<comment>Mid-level positions require considerable domain knowledge.  If you don't have that knowledge it will take a long time for you to become productive and they are looking for someone who can be productive very quickly.  If you don't have the domain knowledge you are not qualified.</comment>

<comment>Right, and setting the bar this way excludes a lot of talented people who aren't neck-deep in federal government jargon.It is very common in the private sector to seek out candidates with high potential, and teach them the domain knowledge.  If the military is struggling to find candidates, they should take this approach.</comment>

<comment>Wrong.  Your talented candidates can apply for entry-level positions.  Don't expect to come in at mid-level when you don't even understand the domain.</comment>

<comment>Nobody with any talent is going to move from a mid-level or senior-level position into an entry-level DoD/ U.S. military position .  That's a huge downgrade.All of this would be slightly more excusable if the acronyms were actually unique systems that required the special domain knowledge you refer to. However most of them are just generic, off-the-shelf systems that are given "super special acronyms" as names.   The whole thing is farcical.</comment>

<comment>You say that as if it's a bad thing.  You ever think that that's not the kind of "talent" the military needs?</comment>

<comment>It is a bad thing. Incompetence is bad.</comment>

<comment>Great article but how about addressing the abject failures of the Commander-in-Chief, who has destroyed troop morale? Selecting an open homosexual to be Secretary of the Army after seven years of a political punk like John McHugh was a deliberate poke in the eye. The former Commandant of the Marine Corps, an unethical liar, deserves his own place in hell.</comment>

<comment>Are you suggesting that the entirety of the US's armed forces are so homophobic that having a gay Secretary of the Army has made them too sad to fight? Bit offensive to the troops, no?</comment>

<comment>politics has hurt morale. I don;t know a single soldier whose morale was negatively impacted by appointing a gay secretary, and frankly, if there are any, then they are weak and not the type of soldier we need.</comment>

<comment>There are too many career opportunities in the civilian world for really bright young officers to want to stay in the Army for any longer than they have to.The USAF, Marine Corps and Navy have better retention but the trend is evident there to.One thing that needs to be understood is that a highly intelligent officer does not automatically translate into a good leader.Leadership can be refined but it is still an inherent part of ones personality and character and cannot be taught like teaching one to play the piano.So if a smart officer leaves the service willingly or unwillingly it may have more to do with his lack of leadership skills than intellectuals skills.Also, the feminization of the military has lessened the allure of military service particularly in the combat arms where certain personality qualities are important.</comment>

<comment>what is "the feminization of the military?"</comment>

<comment>You know exactly what it means and the poster is correct.</comment>

<comment>Author is asking generals and admirals to change the system that made them top dogs. Not likely. Not human nature. These guys and gals are all about accruing all of the power and government-sponsored benefits they can muster.

<comment>"it needs smart people telling them what to do".    And there lies the rub.   The contractors don't want "smart people telling them what to do."  Do you really think that military contractor wants smart people telling the military that the plane the contractor wants to sell is really just a piece of garbage?The dumbing down of government is happening everywhere, not only in the military.The little agency I used to work for had many many Phd's when I went to work for them years ago.   But unfortunately those Phd's could evaluate what the contractor was doing what was best for the government, so there was a definite move in my little agency (by the politicos who had ties to the corporations) to get rid of the Phds.   When I quit, there were only two left - both just putting in their time to returement.  Now my little agency has to rely on what the contractor tells them - it can no longer evaluate whether or not what the contractor wants makes sense for the public, and it is now the contractors and their politicos that control what my agency does,  and the contractors are just getting richer, but you and I aren't benefiting.An example:   This wasn't my agency, but do you remember in 2010 when every airport had a special detector that gave everyone a radiation dose (for "security", doncha know?)?   There were people in that agency (now gone)  who tried to say that purposely dosing the public with radiation was stupid and in no way made the airplanes safer, but Michael Chertoff (former Secretary of DHS) was now working with a company that made these machines.  If you fly, you will notice that those machines are no longer in airports because they didn't do anything for "security", but the company that sold them made huge amounts of money off the Federal Government.</comment>

<comment>"Surprisingly, it was all about people—how to find, get, and keep the best military and civilian talent in the Department of Defense".The military's  recent emphasis on gay and transgendered military members doesn't do much to endear itself to those who would be the most likely to join and stay in the armed forces.  Catering to a fraction of a percent of those in the military is alienating the greater composition of the force.   I left the military a few years ago and friends of mine who stayed are now leaving due to the changing attitudes of the DoD.  Senior enlisted friends of mine are also noticing that fewer are opting to stay in for more years as the climate of the military is focused too much on "social issues" and less on more traditional force issues.  As much attention is given to sensitivity training as is given to war-fighting.</comment>

<comment>I would call treating gay and transgendered members with the same respect and dignity as everyone else more of an expected requirement than some sort of pandering.</comment>

<comment>Of course you would.</comment>

<comment>And you would not? Are you endorsing the opposite?</comment>

<comment>I have a friend in the Navy who's complained thata) There are too many sexual-harassment seminars,b) Some guys are so thick that they need multiple sexual-harassment seminars before they get "stop grabbing people's hair" into their head.</comment>

<comment>The military is probably pretty annoyed it has to waste valuable time and money getting some soldiers to stop harassing other soldiers.In other countries, including Israel, gay soldiers are a complete non-issue, and women have been fighting in combat for years. What does it say about the US that soldiers apparently can't obey orders, including the very simple "stop harassing your colleagues."</comment>

<comment>If the military is getting annoyed it is because of the policies its been directed to enact.  Look at retention rates during "don't ask-don't tell".  The issue of retaining good people was not as dire then as expressed in this article.  It is important to consider that the gay and trans service member is a tiny fraction of the ranks yet DoD has been devoting a greatly disproportionate amount of resources towards them.  Why is that?The example of the Israeli military is fair but not exactly equivalent.  Soldiers in Israel are conscripts, the United States operates on an all volunteer basis so making an environment that appeals to a greater majority of potential recruits is in the best interests of the armed forces.  Recruits and current enlistees who disagree with the disproportionate focus on fringe elements could potentially be put off with joining or reenlisting which further limits the pool of volunteers.Creating a utopia in the military is a pipe dream that will never come to fruition.  The armed forces should focus on building a fighting force instead of engaging in social engineering.</comment>

<comment>I'm the one who's saying that any American who enlists, passes the tests and doesn't wash out can serve his or her country in uniform. You're the one wanting to pass special rules for people spending on what their genitals are and whether those genitals like touching different or the same kinds of gentians. You would have the greatest fighting force the world has ever seen ask potential soldiers about their sex lives.You're the one engaging in social engineering here. </comment>

<comment>There is a lot more to it than anatomy.  Far more than sexuality goes towards morale, unit cohesion and camaraderie.  Forcing people to accept something that they disagree with does not promote unity.  The military is not like a job where you can just leave.  People are legally bound to serve out their enlistments.  Just because something seems to be morally right does not mean it will work when put into practice.  You seem to fail to grasp that.</comment>

<comment>The woman special forces and combat roles thing is a better example, IMHO. Study shows that critics were right after all, that it does have a negative impact on combat performance and that women generally can't hack it at the physical standards we set (surprising no one who has ever watched the WNBA)? Inconvenient, bury it, lower the standards, feel-good nonsense is more important than not getting our boys killed.</comment>

<comment>Nobody joins and stays in the military to spend their days dealing with sexual politics.  I imagine many a First Sergeant has found themselves dealing with sex issues and thinking "I'm too old for this sh*t." and put in his papers.</comment>

<comment>That's true, but the sad fact is that both in the military and the civilian world, sex issues are a problem. They have to be dealt with wherever you find them.</comment>

<comment>The environment is different in the military though.  The fallout that occurs when one ass clown decides to act inappropriately is much different in the military.  He gets his well earned punishment, but then leadership often takes splash damage.  I like being able to sleep at night instead of worrying about what new hell is being unleashed by the troops.</comment>

<comment>And to add, many officers thinking "I don't want to spend my days and nights dealing with this sh*t" and get out of the military.</comment>

<comment>First, it's not "catering." Catering suggests special treatment. There is no special treatment in allowing homosexuals to serve without having to suppress their sexual identity. We don't ask heterosexual military members to do it, so why should we ask homosexuals.Second, I'm sure it alienates some, but not as many as you might think. There are a lot of heterosexual military members who are fine with it.Third, while I respect everyone's right to their beliefs (even backwards, bigoted ones), I do not respect everyone's right to impose their belief system. The US was founded on the principle of equality before the law, and equality of spirit. That's all this "catering" is -- better aligning practice with principle.In regards to "sensitivity training" all I can say is that a lot of that training is unnecessary if you aren't an A-hole, but there are a lot of A-holes. Most people in the military will never see a war front. They will never be shot at, or shoot any anyone. They will work in an office environment, where office team dynamics are very important. Being a sensitive co-worker makes for a more effective military. But I agree, if you are in infantry, you probably don't need this training.</comment>

<comment>The military not structured in such a way that encourages innovation, free thinking or creativity. It's no wonder that there is a brain drain. The smart people use the military to get an education and work experience than then move on to civilian life where they are much better compensated and have to deal with less bureaucratic B.S.</comment>

<comment>Except when the economy goes sour; then, all of your "smart people" become awfully envious of military compensation.</comment>

<comment>The military is completely over staffed with officers who are in turn completely over compensated.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>If it's such a great deal, then feel free to trek down to the recruiting office.And why are you hiding your comment history?</comment>

<comment>Ive served, scum bag and I would have rejoined except that both cancer and diabetes have disqualified me from serving, so I serve my country in a different capacity, as an NIH researcher.  That is how I know how overpaid military officers are, based on how much more money they make than scientists with PhDs and a 20 year publication history.I hide my posting history to prevent being harassed by asshats like you.  I post under my own name with my own picture, so if anyone wants to find me, they are welcome to do so.I have also read a great many of your posts and you are exactly the kind of idiot I despise.  You are a right wing dirt bag of the first order.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>You may want to sign up for a remedial reading class.</comment>

<comment>I've never been in the military.  But to me, it sounds like the problem is less that military officers are overpaid (though they make nice money) and more that researchers are _underpaid_.This has been a problem for quite some time.  Research in the private sector has been destroyed by MBAs looking for short-term easy bucks.  Research in the public sphere seems to always have yet another budget cut.The result is a lack of funding and crappy salaries.  PhD scientists have been making peanuts for a generation now.But don't forget!  We have a DESPERATE STEM SHORTAGE!!  THE LOW WAGES JUST MEAN THE SHORTAGE IS GETTING WORSE!</comment>

<comment>The average scientist with a PhD and publication history couldn't carry an infantry platoon leaders jock strap...JS</comment>

<comment>That's just too much of an over reaching yet vague statement.  I recently ended my career as a First Sergeant in the Army Reserves.  I had just gotten my company up to a full complement of officers for the first time in about a decade.  OTOH, I was on a training exercise a couple of years ago where I had to brief over 100 full bird Colonels and a couple of Generals.  This exercise only had 4000 Soldiers in it.  I think I would have to disagree about the pay, though.</comment>

<comment>I don't want to speak for him, but I can say that my opinion is that there are a lot of grossly underpaid enlisted, especially highly skilled a senior NCOs, and a lot of overpaid O3-O5s</comment>

<comment>I don't think the pay for 03-06 is too much, but I would agree that there seem to be too many of them.  We called majors on BN staff "good idea fairies" because they seemed to be the ones who came up with all of the "good ideas" to justify their positions but add nothing to the training, welfare or readiness of my troops.</comment>

<comment>An average battalion only has 2 majors...and both were that bad? Now if you're talking the division and above level I'll agree with you.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I was generalizing.  Mobilized reserve BN's are usually heavier as well as the FOB mayor cells.</comment>

<comment>It always depends on the position and level of responsibility. A battalion commander is not over paid....an O-5 staff officer below division might be. I've known a lot of NCOs that had the attitude that officers are overpaid until they had the same responsibility....and then the tune changed.</comment>

<comment>Purely a temporary situation.</comment>

<comment>We aren't necessarily better compensated. Look at a mid-level officer in DC serving at the Pentagon, writing white papers on issues they aren't fully qualified to opine on. Let's say she has a bachelors in poli-sci and an online masters in "leadership management." She's likely making bank as compared to a civvie with a PhD in foreign relations.</comment>

<comment>Why isn't the mid level officer qualified to opine on an issue? That's a complete load of crap. You're saying that education equals intelligence and experience. Now, obviously you have a specific situation in mind, but it doesn't apply to all.</comment>

<comment>Of course there are plenty of qualified FGOs, but I know, from personal experience, that there are a lot of unqualified ones as well. Education does not equal intelligence, but it does affect how informed your opinions are.</comment>

<comment>I'm skeptical of the assertion that there is in fact a "brain drain."  The army does have a problem with retention of company grade officers but that is mostly related to the operational tempo -- wars that stretch on for over a decade tend to wear out the troops.I'm fascinated with the way perceptions of career military people vacillate over time.  When the economy is good, you'll hear people say that there are better opportunities and better pay in the civilian sector and no one with talent would stay.  Then, when the economy sours, those same people scream that military personnel are over-payed and we need to slash their compensation.I suspect that this article is in fact a passive-aggressive argument for eliminating one of the few remaining defined benefit retirement programs in America.</comment>

<comment>I don't think this article even mentions benefits. Although military benefits are certainly a target-rich environment for criticism.</comment>

<comment>Wasn't the article about retention of quality leaders?</comment>

<comment>You leave me with no doubts that the personnel system in our military is in need of review, but to tie this to the larger thesis that it is responsible for a lack of talent is not a clearly-supported theory. I would tend to point more towards this:"Which citizens the military attracts, what cognitive and leadership qualities they possess, and how many of them stay for a career are issues of strategic importance to the nation’s security."Which citizens are attracted to the military? What cognitive and leadership qualities do they possess? I've thought about military service many times, but always decided against, and it isn't because of the personnel system. It's because I know the culture of the military is hostile towards me, an intellectual and a socialist-communist-atheist-muslim. I understand the need for discipline and troop morale, but I don't want to wake up every morning to a faceful of OOH-RAH. Let's see, where's that other golden snippet you seemed to take the wrong conclusion away from?"[Millenials] dislike hierarchy, bureaucracy, and inflexibility in the workplace and private life."See, it's not that I object to heirarchy itself. I understand why it is an effective organizational structure for a military and many other kinds of organizations. It's the fact that the military takes so much pride in its heirarchical structure and emphasizes it so strongly. When you come in as a grunt, you get ritually shat upon until it's totally clear to you and everyone else that you get zero respect. When you complete basic training they give you a ceremony and a pat on the back and say "NOW we respect you" and then proceed to continue shitting on you for years on end. I don't expect or desire hero-worship in our military, I don't expect a new recruit to be able to give orders, disobey orders, or draw a hefty pension. What I look to see is people being treated like people, and every single time I examine the military all I can see is a startling absence of that exact thing. I want to serve my country without licking boots. Maybe that's too much to ask. Have fun with your talent problem.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Personally I decided not to join because I have no trust in our political leadership using me well while in service. Screw that. I'll manage my own life thank you very much.</comment>

<comment>You seem to be really angry, and not just about your perceived inability to hack it in the military. You should probably work on that rather than focusing your anger on an organization which would be better off without you.</comment>

<comment>Yes, thank you, precisely this attitude here. An unwillingness to be demeaned gets magically transformed into an inability to hack it. Being willing to put up with being told you're worthless and vile somehow is a virtue in military culture; having any pride for yourself that doesn't come from your identity as a soldier is vain, weak, and effete. Anyone who feels otherwise obviously has personal issues, because normal people and good, God-fearing Americans love nothing more than to be put in their place.</comment>

<comment>Except that, other in your mind, that isn't what happens in boot camp, and it is even further from the truth in OCS. Look, we get it. You were either rejected from service for mental problems, or couldn't hack boot camp. No need to take it out on the good men and women who can make it and serve their country proudly.</comment>

<comment>If that's not the way the environment really is in the military, I'm glad to hear it, but that's what I get from every account the dozen military members in my family give me. I know it's not Full Metal Jacket in boot camp any more (especially in the Air Force, they say), but the Marines especially have retained a lot of that old-school psychological conditioning. Mere obedience does not suffice for a drill sergeant; you must prostrate yourself and make a false show of enthusiasm and you must chant along about how the US Military is above reproach. It is, I repeat, psychological conditioning for obedience and group cohesion, and I do understand why that is useful, but I simply don't believe that it's necessary, and it's not an atmosphere I can ever be comfortable in or a face I can wear without resentment.</comment>

<comment>I question whether you know anyone that has served. Your knowledge of the subject is scant and incorrect. While boot camp "tears you down" in the first phase, it builds you up in the second. That is true for all three branches. And, once you are out of boot camp, you are given value added training in whatever specialty you have chosen. While you still have a hierarchy, as you do in any organization, it is hardly the subservient bootlicking you portray it as.That you can't even understand why "unit cohesion" is important is rather telling. Look, I get you don't have what it takes. You don't need to beat yourself up over it. Not everyone has the ambition, intelligence or talent for the military environment. You need to move on and quit blaming your personal inadequacies on those who do have those talents.</comment>

<comment>I hope you're right that I'm so wrong about military culture. It would be nice to think I could serve with dignity and respect and not be belittled and demeaned the whole way. As for me and my personality, I will be the first to admit that it makes me unsuitable for service in our military (that's my core thesis here), but I don't understand why you insist that this amounts to a massive character flaw; and your insistence that it does is paradigmatic of an unrealistically elitist attitude that military and civilians alike have about our military. If you're not suitable for service, in your worldview it follows necessarily that you are an inferior individual. Disliking authority, heirarchy, etc., cannot be, on this view, positive or even neutral traits, nor can they be legitimate rational viewpoints. On your view, the only possible explanation is that I have personal problems and I am rationalizing in order to conceal my genuine motive, which is resentment and an inferiority complex. It's a very interesting theory, but unsubstantiated, and irrelevant to the content of my critique. You'd be better off questioning the accuracy of my opinion, because all the anecdotes I hear from my father and uncles are from the 70's and are lathered in nostalgia. I've not served or had any active duty friends. All I have are popular media depictions and grisly Tales From Old-School Boot Camp. But if we want to move back to the topic of the military's talent shortage and the question of who joins and why, this is very relevant. My perception of the atmosphere in the military is not an uncommon one and the source of my opinion is not either. If the military could communicate to me that I could serve without having to sacrifice my dignity or my conscience, I might have thought a lot harder about all those nuclear submarine leaflets they sent me after the ASVAB. Instead all I saw was more of the same tired old agitprop, and frankly, that's all I see from you too.</comment>

<comment>Find some young vets or people currently serving.  The military now is not like it was when your dad was in so all of your conceptions are wrong.  I just retired from the Marines, did both boot camp AND OCS, and neither was much like what you're describing, and it is nothing like that once you've graduated from basic training.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for these less invective responses. I spoke with my cousin last night who did live on base for a few years and whose father was in for a lot longer than mine. He says that while it's theoretically possible for some butter bars to roll in and be an ass to the enlisted, afterwards they speak to their CO and Mr. High-and-mighty gets a royal ass-chewing from someone further up. And he mentioned without prompting the nepotism, career death, and etc. discussed in this article. I guess I really did make this unduly personal. Thanks again for the level-headed rebuttals.</comment>

<comment>I was harassed all through basic and most of OCS.  I can't agree with you on that one.That aside, some people just aren't good for the military. It's best they know that instead of entering a job they despise and making life hell for everyone.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it's best when people recognize their personality doesn't suit the military.  Then leaders don't have to deal with a guy with authority issues asking "why" all the time.The Army, for example, is a pretty good life for most people.  Typically, the hardest part of each day is just getting up on time for work.  But it's not for everyone.</comment>

<comment>There are plenty of intellectuals, socialists, muslims, atheists, jews, christians, black, white, gay, and even a few libertarians in the military. The thing is, when you join the military they tell you that you are no longer any of those things. You are a soldier. Some people don't like that. That's fine but the "military culture" is not hostile toward you.  I spent 25 years in the military and not once was I ever required to lick a boot. Yes, have to earn the respect and trust of your peers. There is a very good reason for that military culture. It is because your life, and the lives of your fellow soldiers depends on it. If that's not for you, I suggest you just leave it at that.</comment>

<comment>Great post.  My time was from 1963 to 1996.  Of course I encountered all the 'types' you mentioned but the only type I recognized or cared about was the 'soldier'.You did leave one group out and that is the 'jerks'.  They come in all sizes and grades beginning at E-1 level and rounded off at O-10.</comment>

<comment>Were you with group?  I was at 5th 1996-2010.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I was with a group from 1967 through 1995.  There were a couple of short breaks in between those years for other assignments outside SOF but I always returned.</comment>

<comment>How is one able to be an "atheist muslim"?I do appreciate that you understand your strengths and weaknesses.  Some people don't do well in the military regardless of their capabilities and it's best for everyone they avoid the military.  It's certainly not for everyone.</comment>

<comment>America hasn't won a war since WW2</comment>

<comment>Not true by a long shot.  I count Korea as a win, despite North Korea's intransigence to signing a peace accord after the war.  All it takes is a satellite photo of the Korean peninsula at night to prove my point.We won in Grenada in 1083 and in Desert Storm, those being conflicts that were solved with overwhelming force and conventional warfare of the kind the American military mind can wrap their heads around.  We fail miserably in counter insurgency warfare (Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq) because of how higher level military 'leadership' is selected and trained.If you have a point to make, stick to facts.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Grenada was a war? More a commando raid. :)</comment>

<comment>Lol, Im not going to argue with you on that.  As someone who was there, it is almost an embarrassment to call myself a 'combat veteran' in comparison to the men and 3women who have suffered and served over the last 15 years of ill adviserd military disaster  that we have suffered recently.On the flip side, I have a CIB, so as ridiculous as it was and sounds, it does count.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Nobody is essential to the Military. That's the beauty of the system.</comment>

<comment>No one person, you mean.  Talented people are essential.</comment>

<comment>That must be why America has not won a decisive military victory since WW2.  Because we've got such a beautiful system.  Right.  And they hate us for our freedoms.</comment>

<comment>There's a lot here that's very persuasive, but there are also a few big gaps in the case that there is a brain drain. Like: are academy grads leaving at higher rates than people from other commissioning sources? Are people who did better in their commissioning sources (like, higher on the Order of Merit List, or whatever the equivalent is for their source/service) leaving at higher rates? When we look at the enlisted side, what's the relationship between AFQT scores and attrition? Someone in DoD has this data, and finding a few high performers who left is no substitute for finding it and analyzing it.Also, why is keeping technical know-how within the commissioned officer ranks the goal? Maybe it makes more sense to hire that person as a civilian. If you have to give that officer more flexibility in order to retain them, that kills some of the comparative advantage of having them be an officer and not a civilian, anyway.</comment>

<comment>The various branches of the DoD are ruled by people, mostly men, who are well-connected to each other and many of their former peers who have retired and now work high-level advisory or BoD jobs among big name defense contractors like Boeing, Raytheon, or Lockheed. They are not particularly concerned about retention as a rule because if someone is leaving the service because they couldn't hack it for some reason then it's justified away on that basis. If someone is leaving the service because they are bright and talented and can get a better deal in the private sector then that removes highly competitive officers from the pool of people who would be competing for the same positions as the ones who stay.There is no motivation whatsoever for the DoD to focus on retention in this paradigm.</comment>

<comment>This article displays many of the problems with the military, but no in the way the author intended.  As a matter of fact, it is obvious (to me at least) that LTG Barno is part of the problem that he decries.Let me get something off of my chest right now, I view the Marine Corps as an anachronism and believe that it should be disbanded and its members rolled into the Army to reduce waste, duplication and to eliminate the toxic culture of the Marine Corps.  This goes back to one of the early 'points' made in the article, that 40% of today's Marine officer corps would not qualify under WWII standards.  During WWII, black Americans werent allowed to serve in the Marine Corps and that racist exclusionary behavior continues to this day.  Currently, less than 1% of Marine aviators are black and to best of my knowledge there is currently only 1 black general officer currently serving, a number slightly over 1%.  This also points to the larger problem of why the services are currently in such bad shape, as the officers that make the retention decisions propagate the prejudices and bigotry under which they were selected.The other problem with this article is that all the service members used as examples are officers, despite the predominance of enlisted men in service, they are not represented at all in an article on the need for intelligence in today's services.  This copntempt for the men and women that actually do the real work in the military is just another example of flawed thinking from military 'leadership'.  As a matter of fact, it is my belief that all officers should be selected from the enlisted ranks, sent to college then commissioned, to make sure that all who serve with a commission are actually committed to military service and suited for same.  This would also serve to engender understanding of the enlisted troops who serve and empathy for said same.  It is infuriating that this article complains about retention in the military and completely avoids the issue of enlisted troops, more than 20% of whom are on food assistance to make ends meet.The problems outlined in this article arent in any way, shape or form new.  A fine example of the duration of such issues can be found in the autobiography of Col, David Hackworth, 'About Face'.  It is a great story, but describes the rise of the 'corporate' mentality of the military going all the way back to the early 1950s.  As time has gone by, the military has become more and more intolerant of unconventional thinkers, real leadership and anything short of homogenization for promotion in the services.  The current services are bloated with officers (with all services having greater than 20% commissioned officers (except the Maire Corps, with just over 10%) and a flag officer component greater than that of Vietnam, when the services had 4 times as many troops in uniform.Someday maybe there will be military reform, but unfortunately it will not come from currently serving officers and will be fought against tooth and nail by the contractors that benefit from military incompetence and lack of accountability.  Like the medical field and post secondary education systems in this country, we spend more in gross or per person than any other country in the world and get less for every dollar we spend.  Until we demand better from the uniformed and civilian leadership that currently burdens our armed services, we will continue to deal with the same issues of waste, fraud, ineffectiveness and incompetence that are evident today.2/505 PIR, H-MinusHave a great day!</comment>

<comment>Anyone who writes "During WWII, black Americans werent allowed to serve in the Marine Corps ..." has no idea what he's talking about. Google Montford Point Marines.</comment>

<comment>"I view the Marine Corps as an anachronism ..."Then you don't understand the Corps' mission. And what, precisely, is toxic about the Marine Corps culture? I served 8 years as a Marine, and while I dealt with the usual Mickey Mouse stuff all the services deal with, I found nothing toxic about it.</comment>

<comment>definitely agree with your point on the Marine Corps.  sounds like an Army function, walks like an Army function, quacks like an Army function: it's an Army function...</comment>

<comment>The section on the Marine Corps is SO wrong I don't even know where to start. My guess though, is that you first saw a Marine recruiter and found out you wouldn't cut it so you went the easy route and joined the Army instead and now have Marine Envy.You also have no idea what the real mission of the Marine Corps is, nor its capabilities since you probably think all we focus on are WWII type beach assaults.My experience with the Army in Iraq was disappointing to say the least.  Generally quite undisciplined, fat and out of shape, and unable to complete simple missions.  One example; an Army convoy called us because they found a suspicious package on the road (suspected IED), so we sent an EOD team and security out to link up with them and handle it.  Our convoy arrived, and none of the Army guys (wont even call them soldiers) were outside the vehicles, none were standing guard, and none answered their radios.  We assumed the worst and rolled up ready for an ambush.  No ambush; the ENTIRE patrol was sleeping in their HMMWVs, three miles east of Fallujah.  Yes, THAT Fallujah.  If anyone should get rolled up into another service, the best and brightest in the Army should get rolled into the Marine Corps and we'll pick up your missions instead.  Definitely get more bang for the taxpayer's buck that way.</comment>

<comment>You know, when you go to one of your NASCAR races, and they support the troops, it's only because the military spent your tax dollars on that "patriotism"</comment>

<comment>". In the U.S. military, there are no quarterly earning statements, no public stock prices, no annual profit and loss numbers. However the military performs, it seems simply good enough. "Is this not an incredibly stupid thing to say?I mean, the military, whatever it is, is not a business. It's about winning wars when the peace is lost and keeping the peace otherwise.Perhaps the military ought to be measured on those criteria.Or is that just crazy talk?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Efficiency and quality may not matter in the military in the same way that it matters in the civilian world. Maybe these qualities, but I'd need to see the argument. I haven't. Granted, I'm not military and don't know how they measure these things, but the military isn't like anything in the civilian world and thus I'm not sure that the same metrics apply or can apply. Perhaps with respect to procurement of food, weapons and ammo, some metrics can apply. When it comes to devastating foes on the battlefield, eh, not so much. Also when it comes to being able to lead people to face their possible deaths, I don't know that there is any comparison.Case in point, what equivalent is there in civilian life to SAC in WWII? Where in civilian life do you tell thousands of people that 1 in 8 of you will die and that you will go forth and destroy the homes, business, and lives of as many millions of people as possible? What metric from civilian land applies? Or take the strategic missile operators whose job it is to end the world. What metric from civilian land applies? You are required to turn these keys and push these buttons and thereby end the lives of millions. You're also required to sit here and do that job knowing that when the time comes, there will be a nuclear or several nuclear warhead targeted directly at you. What civilian measure applies?That is some f**ked up shit that military folks do. What is the civilian world measure for f**ked up shit? How many years you spend in prison?</comment>

<comment>I have big trouble with the whole presentation.  Not necessarily the premise, although I wonder if they've Oxy-Moronized the matter with their clever title.And whereas his military career might be counted as a blessing, you could also make the statement that Barno is too close to the subject to provide dispassionate analysis.I believe the U.S. military (all militarys?) suffer from an inability to find, and keep, the best possible personnel.  But this article does little to address the issue.The military, like police departments, want people who will 'do what they are told,' no questions asked.  That conformity leads to a vacancy in creativity and imagination which renders the organization(s) incapable of adjusting to what has become a VERY fast-changing/developing world.  Both organizations are behind the curve and more problem than solution.Back to the article.  WAY too long.  I bailed before the half-way mark.  I thought the selection of a helicopter pilot as an example of "The Best And Brightest" (my phrase) 'peculiar.'  And why did the authors feel 'compelled' to refer to the helicopter as a 'Super' Cobra.  Yes, that's what Bell calls it, but that IS marketing, folks.  I sense a form of rigid, yes, conformity, in the authors in this case.  "That's it's name, damnit!!"  ??  And WHY on Earth would Atlantic use a picture of same firing a missile?  In support of the message?  Well then, I'd ask, "What message?"I fear my respect/admiration for this journal is more based on its past than its present.  I see them trying WAY too hard to market themselves on the internet, in the process diluting their prospect.You know, of course, who penned, "So it goes?"  One of my favorite phrases but I've 'adopted' that lady journalist's 'version,' AND so it goes.  Has a nicer ring to it although the original hits home harder.</comment>

<comment>Recruiting talent for the US Army is kind of like recruiting talent for the Columbia Lions back in the day... Going years without a win makes it a lot tougher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>That really isn't it, at all. Very few people interested enough in finding out about the military look at any of our recent military excursions as "losses" by the military, and rightly so.</comment>

<comment>The prospect of joining an organization that focuses more on social engineering than on war-fighting is off putting.</comment>

<comment>"During the darkest days of the war in Iraq, from 2004 to 2006, there was little thought given to replacing military leaders, even when the combat effort was clearly failing. Even losing a war—or nearly doing so—seems to be an insufficient impetus to objectively assess military performance and hold leaders accountable."To be fair, little to any of this was a result of MILITARY leadership per se. Most of it was a result of policy decisions made by their civilian leaders.</comment>

<comment>well, killing everyone is usually not an option but i am sure the MILITARY leadership has it on the books...</comment>

<comment>"The military personnel system must be designed first and foremost to meet the needs of the service, not those of the individual member. “Selfless service” is a value widely revered throughout the military."To me, this echos an argument I hear a lot about public school teachers. The argument goes that we don't need to make the job any more desirable, we just need to hire people who care about the work and purpose so much that they accept terrible pay and working conditions. In reality, the most talented, motivated people are the first to pursue other careers when they feel their talents are not properly utilized. They want to serve selflessly, but see other places where they can serve and feel a sense of accomplishment.I have not served in the military, but I notice a common thread in stories about military culture where there are entrenched ways of thinking and change is slow. For example, antiquated inventory methods lead to massive waste of funds. So many technologies that are clearly failing get pushed along anyway because nobody can accept the sunk cost and cut their losses. This tells me that the military needs new ways of thinking in order to adapt and work more efficiently.</comment>

<comment>Another point about this article, the idea that the military is to be some means of self fulfillment, as if everyone should have the chance to be a general or admiral, is just off.You do what you're told. You achieve whatever the state decides you should achieve and if the state decides there are no means to achieve or that you will sit around and stagnate for 10 - 15 years, well tough. This ain't your life. This is your service and your service will comport with the needs of the state.After all, the only way to really open up career paths for military personnel are to fight massive scale, full on, total wars like WWII where new divisions with all the requisite billets are being created every month and casualty rates are measured in the tens of thousands per month. In that situation, there's tons of opportunity to advance. You can't get decent leaders fast enough and every opportunity for any halfway decent person is more open (not totally open, but more open) is available.And who in their right mind wants to incur that cost (i.e. WWIII fought somewhat like WWII rather than a nuclear conflict) just so some people can have rewarding high level careers in the military and have a better chance of becoming a general or admiral? C'mon author. Give your head a shake.</comment>

<comment>What can you expect, our armed forces have become wussified.</comment>

<comment>What evidence is there of that?</comment>

<comment>The Commander in Chief's orders of talking to the enemy instead of fighting with the enemy. Reading the enemy their Miranda rights. Yea, that is tough and strong. That's the fighting spirit-(Hey, men we can suck your d icks, now...it's all the Liberal rage-you know.) Yep-wussified and pamper-fied. Just like our commander in Chief, who by the way is ready to close country club GITMO to release terrorists upon our soils! Oh, boy.   HELLO? Are you blind, deaf, or just plain dumb? Maybe all three?...eh?</comment>

<comment>That has everything to do with the policies of the administration and nothing to do with the military itself.  Maybe talk to some people who are currently serving.  You might realize that they aren't thrilled with some of the nation's policies right now either.</comment>

<comment>You must concur with my previous comment some-what. Then who and what is truly in charge?  Has  BO's law become above the constitutions law?  Then hot da mn,  which law does the Military serve? The what or the who? That is the question?  The answer is right in front of all to see. The nakedness of truth is quite revealing. Indeed! :)</comment>

<comment>You are correct about the policies but the damage is done.  The civilian policy makers have installed high ranking staff that controls the military and promulgates those disliked policies.  It is entirely reasonable to consider that the present policies dissuade many from considering enlisting.  The policy towards gay and trans service members is particularly telling.  A tiny fraction of all serving members has been given a disproportionate amount of attention.  Why?  Are they so much more important?</comment>

<comment>Cool story broYou one of those posters who's now gonna claim that the USA military has been going downhill since Truman and 1948?</comment>

<comment>With all due respect Tomas, I would stress two points: Number one...I am a sister and not a bro.  Just so you know you are talking to a woman! Number two, the cool story are the cold hard facts. Nah, our whole da mn country home has fallen down the spiral since 1913...when the department of labor was created, then came the Clayton Antitrust act in 1914 that applied to thee and me in private enterprise but not to thee in government. Then came laws that protect government but not thee and me up to and past Trueman. Also came the taxes to pay for the good ole governmental system of gov.corp and the retirees. Now my grandchildren are stuck paying for these debts and unfunded liabilities without their consent or their representation.  It is a governmental issue which includes all the Liberal wussies, their snares, and their backwards ideas that only benefit the top corporation in the world...USGov.Corp. (What a beast)</comment>

<comment>Talk instead of fight?  You mean, like, diplomacy?  And release terrorists upon our soils?  You REALLY need to get off the far right wing nut job websites.</comment>

<comment>He traded five terrorists for one deserter and that was diplomacy?  Is it diplomacy, when our military men are suppose to close their eyes when Muslims rape little boys on our bases in Afghanistan? Yea, right! You really need to stop drinking the kool-aide and stop being a wussy!</comment>

<comment>"Rolling in with rockets and cannon fire to relieve a Marine unit pinned down under enemy fire became the ultimate high."Maybe they should develop a psychological test that teases out personality traits that thrive in war. </comment>

<comment>"Maybe they should develop a psychological test that teases out personality traits that thrive in war".Why?  War is what these people are there for.</comment>

<comment>Nope. A large majority of enlistees are enlisting to get a free college education. Essentially, they're gaming the system because this is what humans do.</comment>

<comment>The smart people should be fighting the cyber wars and making drones much more accurate. The boots-on-the-ground war is so 2000.</comment>

<comment>I don't see "fire all the unnecessary brass" in there anywhere. That ought to be step one; get the redundant bureaucrats out of the way and maybe you can make some progress. Until we thoroughly purge the upper echelons we're never going to win a war.</comment>

<comment>Brain drain?  What brain drain?  When you have sociopaths going in, and sociopaths going out, you can't really argue that anyone is using their brain.  Anyone with a brain wouldn't join the DoD in the first place.just listen to all these adrenaline junkies in the article: the thought of being in the service, in a support role but not in combat, is "boring."  killing people is so much more fun, no?i am sure the military will be just fine.  it needs to be smaller anyways, so there are a lot more cuts that could take place.</comment>

<comment>People don't join the "DoD", idiot. Speaking of brain drain...</comment>

<comment>the "join" the services.  contractors and civilians also get hired.  all sociopaths.</comment>

<comment>Smart people do not become mercenaries.Patriots do not fight wars for corporations and banker's profits.Artificial limbs are a poor incentive for enlistments.And no one gives a damn about our troops, they just love the war and the defense industry and let them vets take care of themselves, live homeless and get hooked on psych meds.</comment>

<comment>This sounds exactly like the discussion people in the military are having.Much like that discussion, it's crickets chirping whenever someone asks where the resources are going to come from.  The military doesn't lack for brains; the military lacks for discretion in which money it gets or where that money goes while some disconnected politicians dictate their entirely unrealistic strategic goals.</comment>

<comment>As detailed as this article gets, the military personnel system is even worse than you would think after reading.I could give you endless stories about assignments, promotion and retention in what is effectively a random-walk process.</comment>

<comment>Some service academy applications are down.  Airforce 20% off in the last couple of years.  Probably because drone lol.</comment>

<comment>People who say that the military should do more to attract and retain the "top talent " are exactly the kind of leaders that the military needs to shed. People join the military for a variety of reasons but there is only one reason they stay. There is plenty of room for individual achievement in the military but it is not and never will be the motivating force behind the enterprise.  By the way, the other Captain in the photo with Tyler Jost has a far more impressive resume.  And she's still in the military.</comment>

<comment>If people sign up to put their lives at risk in defense of their country, then it is not unreasonable to expect that their lives will only be put at risk if the actual defense of the country is at stake. Serving the interests of politicians that want to play games overseas in support of some neo-imperialistic dream or abstract ideology is a different matter altogether. It is little surprise that they are finding it harder to convince good people to sign up and stay in under these circumstances.</comment>

<comment>Really good article. I was in for about 10 years, active and reserve, with two deployments post 9-11 and experienced similar frustrations. A lot of Carter's suggestions seem like good ones. I would add reducing the ossified bureaucracy to that list.</comment>

<comment>Maybe they should quit throwing money at defense contractors who will pay anyone with a tax payer paid-for clearance top dollar....</comment>

<comment>Regarding permeability: I've long thought there should be a way for civilians to join the military mid-career.  I mean plenty of military officers leave the military and pick up program management jobs or whatever at the DOD or various defense contractors and they're not starting at the bottome.  There's no reason someone who's spent their career as a DOD civilian or defense contractor doing those jobs couldn't go the opposite route and be an effective military officer.  There should be some accelerated path for people in their early 30s to join rather than start all the way down at O1.</comment>

<comment>The skills that allow soldiers leaving the military to enter the civilian workforce are secondary. While civilians may have technical skills or management experience that would benefit the military there is no equivalent way for them to acquire the skills necessary to be effective military leaders, except in the military.Some medical personnel or others with very specialized skills do actually enter the military well above the bottom but they are limited to jobs where they would generally have no traditional military responsibilities.</comment>

<comment>I mean that's the military's claim but I don't buy it.  There are plenty of civilians with very relevant training who could be put on some kind of accelerated leadership course to get them to O3 or O4.</comment>

<comment>That's not the military's claim, that is reality. I'm not sure what relevant training you are talking about, but I'm not aware of any job in the civilian world that is relevant to leading soldiers in war. The average O1 gets very little respect and zero trust in the military until they have proven themselves. The good ones shut up and do what they are told until they get a clue. A shake and bake O4 would be guaranteed to fail. The military is not the corporate world.</comment>

<comment>I tend to agree.  I once had a fellow O4 start talking about my poor haircut (because I'd been out to sea for two months and our 'barber' had butchered the entire crew's hair).  I could tell from his ribbons and lack of warfare insignia that he'd never been out to sea.  Needless to say, that conversation ended with his tail tucked between his legs.The experience required to be a high ranking officer validates their authority, in many ways.  It shows you've spent some time slugging it out in the trenches.  And honestly, if you aren't going to be a leader, why be an officer?  That's what officers are.  Some are better than others, but that's what officers do.</comment>

<comment>I just retired from the Marines and started a new career in the true civilian world (not a DOD contractor or DOD civilian).  My last job in the Marines was current operations officer for a 6,000 person unit.  My current job has me supervising about 20-30 people with several ancillary duties.  The scope is much smaller and theoretically should be easy for me.  However, since I have a ton to learn about the business I'm always busy and working at least as hard as I did in the Marines to keep up.  There is NO way I could do this for a year or two and then move up to an position equivalent to my former Marine position and succeed.  I just don't have the institutional and technical knowledge yet to manage a large organization here (yet).  The same would go for a civilian here that is fast tracked into my role in the Marines.  The people I work with here are smart as hell, but could not do the job I did without years of experience.  Even if they were defense contractors or DOD civilians with no prior active duty military experience.</comment>

<comment>The Navy has Direct Entry Limited Duty Officers (DELDOs) and other types of Limited Duty Officers.</comment>

<comment>DELDO? seriously? rofl</comment>

<comment>It is possible, I have a friend who did it who is working on their PHD, and an expert on nukes, Pakistan, terrorism, and who taught at the Naval War College. From what he said the program he used to become an officer in the Navy was designed for people like him (don't remember what program it was), but that it was very competitive and limited.</comment>

<comment>Especially in a desk bound support role. My father was in the Canadian primary reserve for nearly 20 years after he retired from active service in the mid 70s (his career was over because he married a foreigner) because his civilian career in logistics would have made him extremely important in the event of a mass mobilization.</comment>

<comment>I support the troops, but it's not unreasonable to question the abilities of the top brass. We've fought some long wars with little success.My concern from personal experience is that the current system promotes narrow careerism. There is only one track to success and a million ways to fall short, so the wise officer is cautious and focused on checking the odds and keeping his commander happy. American heroes like Patton and Grant would be weeded out at Company level after annoying their superiors.</comment>

<comment>don't guys like Patton and Grant emerge only after success in battle?</comment>

<comment>I'll throw a little controversy in here - I was an Army civilian for years, and part of what also keeps good people from sticking around the officer corps, based on my observations, was a lack of cultural diversity. Yes, the military is a fantastically diverse place - it has much to teach the civilian world about making race and class a non-factor in a high functioning organization. But the default expectation for officers seems to be conservative politically and Christian, the more evangelical the better. No, it's not a requirement, but it's definitely ingrained in the culture, and yes, there are commanders who keep tabs on who attends prayer breakfasts and bible studies. Nothing wrong with being conservative or a Christian, (I am at least one of those things) but it leads to a bit of group think. And if that was just not your thing, you might not gel as well with your colleagues, nor might your spouse during deployments and the other spouses are a support network. Again, that's just what I observed working for the Army. I understand from multiple sources it's even worse in the Air Force, less so in the Navy.</comment>

<comment>I'd say the religiosity of the military is actually highly overstated. There are large number of soldiers who are Christians and many fall into the fundamentalist category but that is true of the population in general. My informal survey of those who bow their heads and those that don't when it comes time for prayer actually suggests there are more military non-believers than there are in the general population. There may be commanders who keep tabs on their soldiers church attendance, but there are very few dumb enough use their position to push their religious beliefs. The occasional abuse serves more to illustrate what happens when they cross the line rather than an indication of a problem.</comment>

<comment>To some extent I agree.  But for the most part, discussion of religion or politics in a professional setting amongst the Navy officer ranks is considered bad form and generally frowned upon.Not saying the majority of people are conservative (they are, at least amongst the more senior ranks), and some are certainly religious.  But it's role in the running of an organization is sort of marginalized because we try not to talk about it.</comment>
