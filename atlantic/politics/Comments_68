<comment>We cannot trust Donald Trump.Of course, we'd be foolish to trust Ted Cruz too.  These two are the whackiest of the whackiest.And Ben Carson, well, he's a lightweight with strange opinions, and I would not trust him either.As for Bush, who wants another one of those?  And Rubio, well...Kasich might be the best equipped to actually govern, but there are much better choices on the other side of the aisle.  You can't trust Republicans.  They let the nut jobs take over their party.</comment>

<comment>What choices on the other side? A conniving liar who changes her positions for every audience or a Marxist wackjob with no understanding of economics or achievements who thinks Venezuela is a good economical model for US.</comment>

<comment>Republicans said both things about FDR back in his days. History will make you smarter.</comment>

<comment>Franklinstein Roosevelt.</comment>

<comment>That's what the upper-class white Republican anti-semites called him not long after they wrecked the economy leading to the Great Depression. They were upset that the New Deal was actually trying to fix things for the commonweal. Funny how Republican name-calling never ends and is mostly a sign of a paucity of ideas.</comment>

<comment>Paucity of ideas, and a simply stunning level of immaturity.The GOP is bankrupt, and idiots like Lev Bronshtein are Exhibit B.  Trump is Exhibit A.</comment>

<comment>None of the upper class white GOP antisemites turned away the SS St Louis </comment>

<comment>I'm not Republican.  Cry harder.</comment>

<comment>Hitler is still dead, cry some more yourself.</comment>

<comment>So your idol is being insulted?  Cry cry cry.Roosevelt gave over Eastern Europe to Communism.He was scum, plain and simple.</comment>

<comment>I hate this place.  Leaving now.</comment>

<comment>FDR was America's greatest president ever. (And the way things are going, he'll likely keep that number one spot forever.) He ought to be on Mount Rushmore.</comment>

<comment>Not so great for the Japanese Americans he locked up just for being Japanese Americans.</comment>

<comment>Lolz, what a Communist.</comment>

<comment>Communist!!! Drink!!!! Geez it's pretty early in the morning here but...</comment>

<comment>"gave over"? He owned it in the first place? No, no, wait, don't tell me, if Trump had been back in time he would have been so strong and so tough that no communist would have DARED take over.Cruz would have ...uh, government shutdowned them into peace and capitalism? Carpet bombed them? (they would never shoot back of course)Rubio would have.... gotten thirsty?Carson would have trapped them in grain pyramids.Jeb! would have grinned as if he had bad gas.And I'm sure you know exactly what should have been done better than any of them.Well, get to work on that time machine. Don't tell us how you'd have fixed history, SHOW US!</comment>

<comment>I have no idea what you're getting at that has anything to do with Franklinstein Roosevelt.</comment>

<comment>Then cash in your chips and go home. This game is not for you.</comment>

<comment>Cry me a river, and then I can kayak down the rapids.</comment>

<comment>David Ben-Gurion - He was scum, plain and simple?Led the ethnic cleansing of at least three-quarters of a million indigenous Palestinians, that created the Jewish state on land that had been 95 percent non-Jewish prior to Zionist immigration and that even after years of immigration remained 70 percent non-Jewish.</comment>

<comment>First of all FDR was a well known anti-Semite, secondly it was a global depression,  Blaming the Republicans for the recession is like blaming FDR for WW2. You are an idiot,</comment>

<comment>Smoot-Hawley was a fine piece of Republican internationalism that failed miserably.FDR sponsored Morgenthau and Frankfurter and many other Jews into government agencies.History will make you smarter. Propaganda stultifies.</comment>

<comment>Many? Right. Raising income taxes to 90% sure stimulated things.   The act was repealed in 1934 and guess what happened.  Nothing.  It was the 1930s and global trade was not that big a deal.</comment>

<comment>Oh, this is new, the global depression of the 1930,s caused the stock market bubble of the 1920,s</comment>

<comment>Hey stupid, the market reacts to the economy, not the other way around.  Duh!  Let me re-write you idiotic sentence. The stock market (smart people who owned stocks) sold their stocks, when they saw that the earnings of stocks could no longer support their prices.  Idiot politicians (FDR and others) thought they could fix the market by passing some stupid legislation, it didn't, it caused the bank failures and depression.</comment>

<comment>Hey everyone - let me announce the world record for fallacy density in a paragraph</comment>

<comment>FDR and his wife were BOTH well-established anti-Semites, and his administration was full of anti-Semites such as James Conant, the man he appointed head of the National Defense Research Council - and whose previous tenure as president of Harvard saw anti-semitic quotas established to limit access of Jews to education there.</comment>

<comment>If FDR was so great, why did Congress enact a presidential term limit right after the war?  They knew he had run America like a dictatorship, and didn't want to see it happen again.</comment>

<comment>Ha! You are at least half-right. Yet but you are forgetting that Congress of that era never put a term limit on its own members. They fully enjoyed the seniority system for themselves and the power that went along with it until fairly recently.</comment>

<comment>4 terms baby just like bradshaw montana and brady</comment>

<comment>Actually, you missed his joke. "Franklinstein" was a reference to Mary Shelley's classic character "Frankenstein," the amoral scientist whose creation wrought so much havoc.</comment>

<comment>Are republicans going to freeze dry Scalia like they did with Ronald Reagan and use them both for special occasions like this?</comment>

<comment>Yes you could visit their waxy corpses like seeing Mao at Tianenmen square. </comment>

<comment>Exactly, FDR the true 'Democrat' eating well while America starved.Trump is like Teddy Roosevelt who conservatively got things done for America and those things still are in-place.That is the kind of president Trump will be, doing his best FOR America not against her like we've had for the past 7 years.</comment>

<comment>The Roosevelts were wealthy in their own right before ever ascending to the presidency.  They had money to burn.</comment>

<comment>Trump is nothing like Teddy. Sure, Teddy was a Republican, had some views that would still be in line with conservatives today, and had a boisterous personality, but he was ultimately a progressive and did things that would be considered radically socialist by today's Republican Party. Many Republicans thought as much even at the time.Furthermore, Teddy has a resume far more impressive than Trump. He was a Navy Assistant Secretary, a war hero, a reformative police commissioner, and a governor among other things. What is Trump? He's an obnoxious wealthy businessman and media personality. Teddy would eat him for breakfast.</comment>

<comment>From Gilder Lehrmann Institute of History---" A man full of contradictions, he fought bravely in the Spanish-American War, but also proved himself a presidential peacemaker who averted wars by the skillful use of diplomacy and so won the Nobel Peace Prize. In retrospect, T.R. stands out as a unique American wonder, like Niagara Falls. But his story is larger than a one-of-a-kind personal journey from weakness to strength and accomplishment."He was dying of asthma it was so bad and went into sports for body building.That's progressive and so was his political career based on what he had learned while growing up BUT not the 'progressive' of Hillary nor Bernie which keeps us in the status quo of Establishment Rules.Trump fits quite well the notion of Progressive because everything he plans to do is to move the nation forward with ideas that have caved his opponents as well as the Establishment Congress/Big Business/Media.He and T.R. would've made a friendship with both of them putting the nation first and moving it along and both blunt (obnoxious?) by not holding anything back from the People T.R. didn't and neither does Trump dabble in deceit.</comment>

<comment>I'm not really sure what your quotation accomplishes, but I think you may need a better grasp of what progressivism is in the American context. It's generally associated with social and environmental justice, eliminating corporate and political corruption, and fighting income inequality.  T. Roosevelt certainly falls under that rubric.It's not just about "moving the nation forward." There has never been a president or presidential candidate who claimed do be doing otherwise. Clinton, Trump, Cruz, Sanders, et al. all believe and say that they will push America ahead because that's obviously what everyone wants to hear.Trump is no progressive. Sure, there is an element of populism to the things he says and progressives are often populists, but his priorities are very far away, even polar opposites, from the aforementioned. It's impossible to say how Trump and Roosevelt would have related to each other since they were different men in different times. I think they would have shared much in terms of opinions on foreign policy and little else. Even then, Roosevelt was also level-headed in this regard which is very much not Trump's style.I see Trump as a sort of proto-fascist. His most endearing quality is his charisma and his challenges to the political establishment. He finds most foreign people and governments to be deserving of at least distrust or suspicion. He has vague ambitions to "make America great again" that is rooted in a mythical past that never existed. Most importantly, he appeals to some peoples' worst innate fears and impulses. I find that to be very different from Roosevelt.</comment>

<comment>Pure Progressive is what T.R. and Trump are about, not the give-away-the-kitchen sink with free college tuition that Bernie is touting instead of refining and defining what we already have and saying it out loud.Saying it out loud is key, and that's what's making Media shake at the knees - they 'know' even though they say over and over "This has never been done before (yes, it has) or 'He's got ideas that won't work (yes, they will since they've been played before but the Left ambushed them or the GOP did,) etc.Nothing is ever new, somewhere or other even the USA has done it at least once and it either took or it went by the wayside until a later time since nothing ever goes away.This time Trump means for America to move instead of the stagnation we're in and all that he is saying, as T.R. did, is not new, is not 'maverick' but things that've always been in the works but seem 'new' to those who've not been paying attention.E.G., T.R. breaking up the Spanish Empire - that wasn't new, not maverick, he just finished what Andrew Jackson started with getting the Spanish out of Florida before going into Mobile and then into Chalmette to fight the British in 1812, and that led to more businesses, more jobs, etc.It is actually true that a true Conservative (as Trump is and T.R. was) can be the best Progressives this country has been dying without.Don't be bushwhacked by not thinking forward because Trump is, T.R. did, and once "and Women" is added to the Bill of Rights then progress will march at an unbelievable rate.You see?  It is not necessary to list everything as you started to since it's already being done again and been done ad nauseum to the point that we're not listening anymore, but things won't progress without equality for women, period, so John Adams' miserable error omitting "and Women' needs corrected first.Please do not conflict Progress(ive) with Socialism since the two are hugely different.</comment>

<comment>I know of no such term as "Pure Progressivism." You will not find in any textbook or journal about American history. Ask an expert of ideology and they will give you a blank stare. I do think "refining and defining what we already have and saying it out loud" matches the sort of proto-fascist qualities I mentioned previously though.What ideas "work" and how have they "been done before?" Not only do you not have any evidence for your claims, you don't even appear to have any specific claims to begin with. The media isn't scared of Trump, not really. In fact, it loves him. He's all it ever talks about. A true sign of media endorsement is not what is said about someone, but how much something is said. Trump is a controversial and charismatic person who has been the center of attention long before his presidential campaign.Then Trump has to wait his turn in the long historical line of people who claim they will move a nation or society forward. Clinton and Sanders propose the same. Why do you trust Trump and not them? I already know the answer. His charisma and superficial unconventionalism appeals to your basic apprehensions and suspicions about America, it's government, and other people. People who actually "pay attention" see this and throw their support behind cooler heads.????????????Perhaps you need a refresher on ideological terminology. Socialism is simply a society where the public owns the means of production. It's often touted as a means to progressive ends, but not inherently so. All of the notable US progressives (Wilson, FDR, Truman, etc.) were not socialists. I'm not sure what socialism has to do with any of this since there are no relevant socialist figures running for president (and no, Sanders is not a socialist).</comment>

<comment>"I know of no such term as "Pure Progressivism." You will not find in any textbook or journal about American history. Ask an expert of ideology and they will give you a blank stare."Well, now, duh, it's fun visualizing ll those dolts you proclaim who have been caught in headlights.because they're not aware.Trump is not an idealist but a pragmatist!He has an open mind, a movement going in this country because of it.....Americans have the opportunity once again to speak their minds and they're speaking it for Trump.The man has plans because he's substance and the plans are not 'ideological in fantasy clouds' but down-to-earth solutions to raise this nation up again and keep it there.Pure progrressivism is the ultimate in not taking no for an answer as in American Does Because It Can, Americans have always been scrappers, whatever it takes in the realm of common sense IN OUR OWN INTERESTS.If you weren't so sunk in "proto-fascist qualities" you might smell the truth which the haze of ideology will not give you.We're done here.</comment>

<comment>Dunning, meet Kruger.So in your view, something like expecting another country to provide the financial and material resources for a comical wall is pragmatic? Perhaps you have a very different definition of the word "pragmatist" than the rest of us. Trump is hardly a pragmatist. I don't even think he is an idealist. I think he is troll who loves attention and loves to say ridiculous things to gain said attention.Who is "speaking their minds" (or more accurately, who wasn't speaking their mind before Trump came into the picture)? Like I said, Trump is an arrogant troll. It is therefore expected the mind from which he speaks is filled with arrogant and trollish thoughts. It's audacious, but no more sincere than what you will hear from any of the other candidates. Regardless, sincerity and honesty hardly count for much when you only have ugly things to say.Again, what is so "down to earth" about the wall? You have yet to state what such plans even are, let alone support why they are pragmatic.Well, you certainly aren't doing a very good job of convincing me Trump isn't in fact a fascist, especially with a vaguely fascist response as this. If there is such a "haze," perhaps you can enlighten and explain to me why Trump is so qualified to lead America without just quoting him about "not taking no for an answer" and such nonsense. I'm quite open to well-supported arguments and evidence.</comment>

<comment>Couldn't miss seeing how you ran away from the topic!!!And thought you could keep your argument and yourself alive by veering off into other topics????Forget it, no time for debate losers from this side especially one who uses up all its time to put words into its opposition's mouth - Bad Form, buddy, but typical of losers in all debates.</comment>

<comment>Is it even worth it to address the ironies and contradictions in this comment? I have "ran away" from nothing, only asking you to clarify and support your claims. You have repeatedly done neither, so therefore it is you who is clearly dodging.</comment>

<comment>You are still running away.Add your blowhardiness to that of Cruz and Rubio who see themselves as 'winners' because they say they are still catching up to Trump.Go away.</comment>

<comment>And what am I running away from? Your inability to make specific statements ensures making sense of them is difficult. "Blowhardiness?" More irony from a supporter of Trump, the quintessential blowhard if there ever was one. </comment>

<comment>Teddy would punch you for that, after beating Trump down. Trump is exactly the kind of person Teddy hated the most. Read at least one biography before pretending you know what you're talking about.</comment>

<comment>Read some more.What I said is true according to history.</comment>

<comment>News flash ... FDR is not running.</comment>

<comment>Yes, thank you. Clearly you missed the point that childish name-calling in the heat of an emotional crisis is rarely a predictor of how things turn out. The vast majority of historians concur that FDR was the right guy at the right time, in spite of what Republicans in the day (who helped bring on the Great Depression, don't forget) screamed at him and published in their broadsheets.ps: Somebody should tell Rubio that Obama isn't running. He and his colleagues seem to be running against the Pres.</comment>

<comment>Ahhh, I believe it was you that threw some name calling with Kasich being a mild mannered Gingrich, as if that's some sort of negative. Newt is a constitutional scholar, who on the other side holds such credentials?And yes, Obama isn't running, but his successors are, and as such wish nothing more than to continue his policies to the 9s. So noting this does have a basis in sound reasoning.Also, what happened with either party nearly 100 years ago has no basis on who's doing what today. Using information along those lines is in no way a logical argument.</comment>

<comment>Pubio's positions that differ from Bush's (30% approval at the time of his exit) are which again?</comment>

<comment>Name calling? ... thank you for conceding the argument.Have a nice day!(PS: It's not about Bush ... it's about progressive policies. A common tactic for the left is to throw up straw whenever their point is defenseless. Oh, yes ... and not answering straightforward questions is another.)</comment>

<comment>What argument did I concede, exactly? Explain why Bush was at 30% on the way out and explain where Pubio differs? Which progressive policies are unpopular? Obama is 17% higher than Bush was on his way out the door. Wear it. Minimum wage increase - popular. LGBT rights - popular. No war in the Middle East - Popular. Path to citizenship - popular. Raising taxes on the upper bracket - popular. Criminal justice reform - popular. Want me to go on? Why don't you paste in all of Pubio's "popular" ideas? Just because you don't personally like Obama's ideas and like Pubio's doesn't make the former's unpopular and the latter's popular.</comment>

<comment>There is no such person, Pubio.  Name calling in a reply is akin to one throwing the first punch when unable to argue effectively. Your claimed "achievements" are exactly what's causing such a rise in the number of voters supporting Republicans over Democrats so far in the primaries.  You also have yet to answer either of my questions, which when answered with yet another question, admits to losing ... you simply can't respond to the questions. And raising taxes on the upper class has been tried ... and we still have a failing economy. It doesn't create wealth, it merely redistributes it, which is a road map to disaster.Oh ... and one other thing. I'm not a Bush fan, nor am I a Rubio fan. My support is with Trump ... you know, the one who has more experience making deals with foreign companies and politicians than either Sanders or Clinton combined. And he's also the one that creates wealth by hiring people. Just how many people have Hillary, Sanders and Obama hired? How many jobs have they "directly" created? ... how much wealth?Your silly replies will not be responded to until you answer those final questions honestly.</comment>

<comment>No answers. Noted and expected.</comment>

<comment>OK ... you have no answers. I accept.</comment>

<comment>You can't refute the popularity of Sanders' positions, thus the best you can do is question my nickname for the SC runner-up.</comment>

<comment>So? Reality is not based on popular consensus. Sanders is unrealistic in his positions --- economically, he's about as smart as a low grade moron.</comment>

<comment>Sanders-Claus never saw a math textbook he could get through.</comment>

<comment>Who said it was? Just wanted you to acknowledge that many of them are popular. I doubt you will though. You'll say they were liberal polls asked by liberal pollsters who polled only liberals, blah, blah, blah...Heard it all before.</comment>

<comment>Next time please reply to my post ... I don't have any idea what you are commenting about ... I never said anything like you think I did. I never disagreed with Sanders' popularity --- please show me where I mentioned anything you are saying about me. Ooops, you can't, because you prefer to argue against straw. Now THAT'S something I've seen over and over.</comment>

<comment>Based on your logic, if I compose a post using the word "Killary," and claim 1+1=2, that can't be right because I didn't call her by her proper name? Do I have this right? Everything I say subsequently is invalid, because I used a disparaging name for a candidate. Correct?</comment>

<comment>No ... your arguments are not invalid because of name calling, they are meaningless because you feel that somehow popularity trumps reason and reality. Then, instead of invoking sound economic and constitutional examples to defend your conclusions, you choose to make fun of someone's name --- 3rd grade tactics. And then I'll bet you somehow feel justified/vindicated in doing so. Just because something is popular doesn't make it right, or the right thing to do. You'll have to do better than that ... much better.And now that I've answered your question, try answering mine.</comment>

<comment>Didn't say popularity trumped anything. I simply gave you the poll #s on the popularity of Bernie's positions and you retorted with how they don't work as policies. Two entirely different discussions. You didn't want to acknowledge the reality that many of his policies are popular and then ran to the refuge of the success or lack thereof of the policies in practice. Two entirely separate discussions. No clue what your questions are.</comment>

<comment>No clue as to my questions? ..."Just how many people have Hillary, Sanders and Obama hired? How many jobs have they DIRECTLY created? ... how much wealth?"Sanders' policies are popular mostly due to ignorance about economics. Heck ... even Hillary when pressed couldn't explain the difference between her (a progressive) and a socialist. Amazing ... and it's her platform. And since you seem infatuated with popularity, it might interest you to note that GOP turnouts in the primaries so far are setting new records in number, while the Democrat turnout is on average dropping by about 22%.</comment>

<comment>I hadn't seen those questions before. No more than Ike, Cruz or Rubio I suppose. Not infatuated at all. Again, just making the point that you're calling ideas fringe that are not, based on polling. Demagogues engender great passion. I agree. Hence the inflated turnout. No arguments there.</comment>

<comment>OK, you're dead to me. You obviously can't (won't) answer the questions asked and you're too lazy to scroll up a reply or two where you would find them, which means you're not even reading my posts. Others will see you for what you are --- you can't hide my earlier posts. You're no better at debating than PeeWee Herman.</comment>

<comment>I hope you'll eulogize me nicely.</comment>

<comment>FDR was a disaster.He literally  'experimented' for 10 years on WE People on ways to end the depression while he never missed a big meal.</comment>

<comment>But that's what some candidates like to do when the prez is unpopular.</comment>

<comment>That is the normal course of 'running' - to compare their being saints to that of the devil already in office.</comment>

<comment>And FDR's New Deal extended the depression. The only thing that saved us was World War II.</comment>

<comment>The premature attempt to return to balancing the budget before the recovery was complete was what extended the depression, not the New Deal.Now where have we heard people screaming about impending doom over budget deficits right on the heels of a major economic crisis and recession lately? Gee, I wonder...</comment>

<comment>Right, when companies are going bankrupt the best thing they can do is spend more money.</comment>

<comment>Companies don't have the ability to issue sovereign debt denominated in their own currency. Trying to reduce things like an entire country's government and economy to that of a single corporation, or worse, a single household or individual, is totally wrong. It's an apples to oranges comparison.</comment>

<comment>So, all a sovereign country has to do to make everyone rich, or to solve a recession, depression, etc is to just print more money (sovereign debt?).   What a great idea. You should tell that to the Greek's Minister of Finance, they could use a great idea like that.  Your Senator should recommend you to be appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.  Hey, I got an idea too, lets raise the minimum wage to $100 an hour, that way we will not have any poor people.  Whadda ya think?</comment>

<comment>Economics 101.  Basic, simple, obvious.  People with money buy Think Tanks and put "scholars" on the payroll to generate spurious arguments against it.</comment>

<comment>Yours is a minority POV among credible historians. WW2 was a huge inflection point, as The New Deal was a process accelerated greatly by it.The rural south got electricity. Old-person poverty changed significantly. People got jobs. And so on. The Republicans of the day preferred to do nothing; hhhhmmmm...sounds familiar.</comment>

<comment>The day Pearl Harbor was bombed, unemployment was still 10% </comment>

<comment>Yeah, down 15% in eight years. Not half bad.</comment>

<comment>Please  explain how the New Deal was "greatly accelerated" by WW2, since it predates WW2.</comment>

<comment>Grasp timelines much? Christ what a tool...</comment>

<comment>Yay! I was waiting for someone to say this. And what was it about WWII that got us out of the depression? Could it have been all the GOVERNMENT SPENDING to supply the war effort?</comment>

<comment>Yup. Massive government spending, creating new industries and bolstering the ones that had already been established.</comment>

<comment>Unemployment was at about 25% at the start of the Great Depression. In 1940 it was still at 15%.	The universal consensus used to be that the New Deal was effective, though not perfect. Moreover, it saved the United States from embracing the extremes of Fascism or Communism as so many other countries did. 	But the Right has invested huge sums of money and put a great deal of effort into manufacturing and then selling the claim that Roosevelt's policies were not effective.</comment>

<comment>It was a world wide depression.  The countries with out the New Deal and all the tax increases came out of it much sooner.  Only America had a "Great" depression, thanks to FDR.</comment>

<comment>Germany came out of it sooner by massive spending on armaments which unfortunately made Hitler popular.</comment>

<comment>As usual, the party in charge when the disaster happens wants to rewrite history.</comment>

<comment>So FDR and the Democrats DID cause World War Two. Thanks for the update.,</comment>

<comment>Big tax cuts would have ended it as soon as it began.</comment>

<comment>Delusional.  In fact, the rich mostly remained rich and suffered no lack of money to invest.  The PROBLEM was... nothing to invest in!  It doesn't help to jack up the "supply side" if there is no corresponding "demand side", like trying to push on a rope with nothing pulling on the other end.</comment>

<comment>The tax cuts line was snark. Sorry you didn't discern that.</comment>

<comment>Ah, WWII, the war that isolationist Republicans tried to keep the U.S. out of (and the GOP had well-documented ties to American Nazi groups). For that matter, Prescott Bush (George H. W. Bush) made a lot of money dealing with the NAZIs and their financiers, helping the NAZI regime. The Guardian had a great expose on that history acdecade ago.</comment>

<comment>Uh... get your facts straight on who was in bed with the fascists.  That would be Joe Kennedy and William Randolph Hearst listed as known supporters of fascism.  http://www.rationalrevolution....</comment>

<comment>You didn't actually even deny what I wrote.  The Neutrality Act, which attempted to prevent America from getting involved with the brewing war in Europe and Asia, was pushed thru congress by Republican Senators William Edgar Borah, Arthur H. Vandenberg, Gerald P. Nye and Robert M. La Follette, Jr., and was opposed by FDR and most Democrats.  The Republicans of that time were the isolationists, and there are NUMEROUS documented ties to NAZI groups in the United States in the late 1930s.  A lot of details are available at http://cosmicpenguin.com/GDY/g...As for Prescott Bush, please go educate yourself: http://www.theguardian.com/wor...</comment>

<comment>WWII spending ended the depression but the New Deal spending ameliorated things.  Plus the New Deal gave us the safety net including Social Security.</comment>

<comment>Tax cuts would have turned it around instantly. Oh wait, Hoover did cut taxes. Never mind.</comment>

<comment>The developed world now follows mostly New Deal policies and global output grew massively thereupon.  Don't get your history from propaganda sources.</comment>

<comment>The guy who didn't end the great depression</comment>

<comment>FDR prolonged the depression just like Obama did.  Socialism is not a cure, it is a disease.</comment>

<comment>that's the rights lie about socialism for over a 100 years. but DEMOCRATIC socialist countries in Europe are doing far better than we are on all metrics. i'm tired of the same old lies by the right and sad you still use them to convince your lemmings er followers</comment>

<comment>Where do you people get your news? "Doing far better than we are on all metrics?" On what planet?  Is that why everyone in the world is trying to immigrate here-- legally or illegally? Is that why one of our 50 states-- just ONE-- would be the fourth largest economy in the world if they were to secede?  Is that why every kid in China, the Philippines, and every other country in SE Asia is trying to master proficient English?</comment>

<comment>You live in la la land.  Check your metrics again.</comment>

<comment>Then please stop driving the interstate highways, cancel your library card, take your kids out of local schools and universities, don't use drugs developed thru NIH grants or hospitals supported with federal monies, cancel your parents' Medicare, ask your farmers to give back their price support subsidies, don't eat meat grazed on federal lands, stop flying because the airline industry is full of federal support and subsidy, as is the petroleum industry that makes gas for your car. And on and on. You may also live in a moocher state that takes in more federal dollars than it produces in federal revenue. BTW, most moocher states are red states.</comment>

<comment>Actually what prolonged the Great Recession was all the panic about debt which cut spending.  Nevertheless, we did better than the European nations.</comment>

<comment>History shows that history will not make him smarter.</comment>

<comment>No understanding of economics?  Because trickle down is working so well?</comment>

<comment>and rich people are job creators, not demand. they don't even espouse capitalism any more, it's just dogma crafted as policy.</comment>

<comment>At least they had the good sense to change the name from horse and sparrow. "Trickle down" makes it sound so much less like "the peasants can eat our $hit."</comment>

<comment>Even left wing Keyenesians agree that Sanders is an economically illiterate buffoon who promises rainbows and unicorns.http://www.frontpagemag.com/po...</comment>

<comment>And if you can't believe a website whose top banner reads "inside every liberal is a totalitarian trying to get out"  who can you believe."weasel news... confirming your biases" comes to mind.  But hey, to each his own.</comment>

<comment>how about a CNN link, does that assuage your liberal biases?http://money.cnn.com/2016/02/1...or whats your media poison of choice?</comment>

<comment>I don't doubt that some economists think, or are at least saying Bernie's plan wont add up.  But there are others out there that think it will save most people money in the long run. The media cherry-picking economists to support a specific narrative doesn't mean much to me. Only presenting one side when there are opposing positions is just catering to the people who already have their minds made up.</comment>

<comment>That sounds so familiar, the weasel news line. What is that from?</comment>

<comment>Medicare for all, K-16 education for all, break up the big banks, raise taxes on the rich and avoid military interventions.  I don't see any unicorns.  The Republicans are the ones who live on magical thinking: cutting taxes will raise revenues, soldiers and bombs can manage the affairs of people on the other side of the planet.</comment>

<comment>Um, every time we have cut taxes revenues have in fact gone up. Just FYI. </comment>

<comment>I hardly ever do this, but..BWAAAHAAAHAAAAHAAA!!!!http://www.brookings.edu/~/med...</comment>

<comment>Sure, link me to a boring 39 page paper and expect me to comment.  No thanks, it's Friday afternoon!  But I did get a good chuckle out of your "Bwaahaaahaaahaaa!!!" So thanks for that.</comment>

<comment>Um, no.</comment>

<comment>Um, yes.  You are entitled to your own opinion, but not your own facts.  Kennedy cut taxes, and federal revenue increased.  Reagan cut taxes, and federal revenue increased.  W cut taxes, and federal revenue increased.  Those are facts.Now, you can argue, like Tim does, that the tax cuts occurred at the bottom of a recession and revenue would have increased anyway.  There is a case to be made there.  However, you cannot argue (at least not with any facts) that revenue did not increase after the tax cuts.  </comment>

<comment>That is only true because tax cuts have most often been introduced as a stimulus at the bottom of a recession.  And in the case of Reagan and Bush II, they were accompanied by massive increases in government spending.  The longest period of economic growth in recent history occurred during the 90's, after Clinton raised taxes on upper incomes.  Too bad the Republicans decided to cut the capital gains rate in the late 90's, turning a nicely growing stock market into an unsustainable bubble, and laying the groundwork for a even bigger collapse in 2008.</comment>

<comment>That may be true, at least there is a case to be made that the Kennedy, Reagan, and Bush tax cuts were done at the bottom of a recession and therefore revenue increases were coincidental.  Hard to prove, but you can make the argument.However, I can then turn around make the same exact argument for the Clinton tax increases that also led to a corresponding revenue increase.  After all, slick willy took office at the end of a recession, so who's to say those revenue increases wouldn't have occurred without tax increases?And blaming the dot com stock bubble and crash on capital gains rate cuts is a bit of a stretch, don't you think?  As Greenspan noted, the market is often defined by irrational exuberance.  The 2008 crash was caused by massive free money policies that led to home loans being made to people with terrible credit, then banks and brokers collateralizing those loans.  </comment>

<comment>That is a fair point about Clinton also benefiting from coincidental trends.  However, if you compare 1981-1992 with 1993-2000, the most remarkable difference is in spending, not taxes.  On-budget spending under Reagan-Bush averaged 17.5% of GDP, compared to 15.5% under Clinton, while Reagan-Bush revenues were 13.1% compared to 13.8% under Clinton.  GWB, increased spending only slightly over Clinton (to 15.8% of GDP), while cutting taxes to 12.5%.  The basic story is that Republican presidents run up the debt, to the tune of 309B annually, compared to 62B annually under Clinton (in constant 2009 dollars).https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb...As for the capital gains tax cut, surely the proponents were crowing in 1999 as the market shot up.  I think most reasonable people would agree it would not have shot up so fast if people were paying 35% taxes on their gains.  Whether avoiding that run up would have also avoided the crash is an open question.The easy money policies that triggered the 2008 crash were  partly due to all the investor capital sitting around with no good place to go.  Higher capital gains rates would have prevented that bloat at the top.</comment>

<comment>You have a very poor grasp of economic statistics,  Clinton did not have to spend money to win a cold war.  He also benefited from the high tech boom, but I am sure you will give him credit for that too.</comment>

<comment>The cold war was nearly over regardless of what Reagan spent.  The increasing flow of information was making it impossible for soviet citizens to continue ignoring the better lives people were living in the west.Instead of letting the USSR collapse under it's own weight, we had the "Reagan Doctrine" which made a mess of Central America as well as pumping $3.2B into arming and training the Mujahideen... who were successful in driving out the Soviets, and then turned their attention to us.  It would have been far better off to leave the Soviet puppet running Afghanistan.  Osama Bin Laden would probably have been killed back then were it not for Reagan equipping them with Stinger missiles.</comment>

<comment>Really, do you think anyone believes that crap?  Tell me when Communist China and Cuba is going to collapse under their own weight?</comment>

<comment>Tim, oh Silly Tim. Baggers gonna bag. Leave it at that.</comment>

<comment>That analysis works fine in retrospect: "introduced at the bottom of a recession."  That's like saying well those bandages only helped because when they were applied the bleeding began to stop.</comment>

<comment>No, it is more like saying bandages prevent cuts because you put bandages on 100 people and only a few of them got cuts.  In fact, inflationi corrected tax revenues have gone up in all but 16 of the last 55 years.  The only years in which revenues declined were:  61,68,70,71,72,75,76,82,83,91,92,01,02,03,08,09.  Hmm, 2 after Reagan cut taxes,and 3 after Bush II cut taxes.It is probably fair to say that revenues go up after tax rate cuts, but they go up faster if you don't cut rates.</comment>

<comment>That's not true.</comment>

<comment>Sure and Trump is a "compassionate conservative"Sanders shows all the hallmarks of a marxist, the 'rich are evil' routines, the economic populism, the insane illiteracy of basic economics. The constant calls for mandatory economic equality as forced by federal laws. This is pure Marxism.http://townhall.com/columnists...</comment>

<comment>Your habit of backing up arguments with links to RWNJ sites is ineffective but amusing.</comment>

<comment>every website or op ed has a political slant. EVERY site. At least I dont lie about my biases and pretend to be 'objective'.</comment>

<comment>Other than when you're using those sites as citations, sure, you don't pretend to be objective at all. Whatever it takes to seem right I guess.</comment>

<comment>why dont you stop looking at the slant of the source and instead look at the argument.In the words of Christopher Hitchens, 'its not what you think, its how you think'</comment>

<comment>You have to admit, you are kind of a nut-job.</comment>

<comment>why don't you grow up?</comment>

<comment>*sigh* I miss Christopher. . . . .</comment>

<comment>But your bias leans towards howling, bat-shit wingnuttery.</comment>

<comment>Why should Republican voters, misled by rightwing media, listen to us, if we only keep insulting them?</comment>

<comment>I get the sentiment here, but in all seriousness, do you really think they'd listen to us if we were as nice as we possibly can be? My sense at this point in about fifteen years of studying American history at a professional level is that you can't fix stupid, and guys like this are just stupid. There's even a psychological theory to explain it: the Dunning Kruger effect. If the rise of the Tea people has any lessons at all in it, it's don't underestimate the effect of American nationalist narcissism on intelligence levels.</comment>

<comment>Idiocracy is a utopia compared to what we'll have if the Republicans become our average citizen. At least in that movie, people were generally nice and cared about each other. And they did end up recognizing that smart people should be the ones in charge. The Republican base are hateful idiots and that's the scariest thing there is.</comment>

<comment>I hear that, especially about the "recognizing smart people should be in charge." I don't necessarily agree that intelligence in one domain should be a ticket to authority in all domains, but let's be real here: the world is far too complicated for everyone to know everything, so we have to rely on experts all the time. What scares the hell out of me is the denigration of expertise among the right (on everything from climate to fiscal policy; Gingrich is really the big culprit here, for cutting Congress's budget for its various information services, but it's been a policy of the right for a long time to pretend like the people who spend all their time trying to learn about a subject are the ones who know the least about it). There are some examples on the far left, but they're really negligible compared to the universal disdain for experts on the right. It's crazy, and it's a one way ticket to Crazytown.</comment>

<comment>Is Dunning Kruger the same as the corollary of Murphy's Law that states that people will always rise to the level of their own incompetence? *evil grin* Sorry I just couldn't resist!</comment>

<comment>Dunning Kruger resembles "too stupid to know you're stupid," but it's not quite that. The technical formulation is that you haven't reached the level of expertise necessary to knowing how much you don't know (e.g. guys who don't know math telling me I don't know anything about economics because I don't think "knowing something about economics" means "capitalism is awesome all the time, shut up libruls!!!1!!"). It's often correlated with a form of egotism combined with low intelligence, since more often than not the people who insist they know more than experts on a subject requiring years of training aren't very bright to begin with but have an enormously high estimation of themselves, but it isn't always that. For example, the case that triggered Dunning and Kruger's interest was a guy who thought, based on knowing how invisible ink works, that if he put lemon juice on his face no one would see him as he robbed a bank, but when he was caught he didn't call the cops stupid and say how great he was; he was just surprised as hell that he got caught - in other words, not knowledgeable enough to know where he went wrong, but also not insistent that he was the smartest guy in the room.</comment>

<comment>I was being facetious, sorry. The bank robber with the lemon juice is hilarious! LOL! Otherwise, your description of Dunning Kruger syndrome sounds alarmingly like poor Mr Trump is a victim, but what do I know ;)</comment>

<comment>Nail meets head on that one.</comment>

<comment>You are mistaking an internet troll for a "Republican voter."  This particular one is likely not old enough to vote.  I'd peg him as 12.</comment>

<comment>Why should Democratic voters, misled by left-wing media, listen to us, if we only keep insulting them?</comment>

<comment>you are far too dumb to be objective</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you're a proud, honest fascist.</comment>

<comment>I used to check out Townhall because they used to be a pretty good place to see a slight right wing angle on economic matters. It has been a long time since I visited and clicking on that link disturbed me. When did that happen? When did they get so off base?</comment>

<comment>"This is pure Marxism."Marxism would be social ownership of the means of production, not heavier taxation and redistribution.</comment>

<comment>stop with this Democratic Socialist nonsense. I see you lapped up the propaganda just as expected.  He is a Socialist.  He loves big government. The bigger the better.  He has zero clue as to how the economy works and his ideas will bankrupt the USA overnight.</comment>

<comment>not overnight but over several years. EU is slowly realizing it cant pay for its welfare largesse,France is reforming its economy by slapping on higher tax rates on top 20% (Hollande's socialist economic policies are what Bernie has in mind for US). Nevermind that Frances economy is stagnant, its plagued by labor union strikes, and no sane company would do business there. This is the future of Sanders America.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, Northern Europe is doing well, even with more worker and consumer protection than Americans would dream about.And yes we pay high taxes but everybody has healthcare, free access to education, etc.There is rich people here - and not many poor. But most important nobody has to fear being homeless or unable to get healthcare when needed.</comment>

<comment>He spent his honeymoon in the Soviet Union. His honeymoon for God's sake! Want a recent success story of someone claiming to be a Democratic Socialist? How about Hugo Chavez?

<comment>Ir's fun to speculate, but at this moment we've had exactly one caucus and one primary out of 50 states (plus DC and various territories and possessions). It's still a teensy bit early to predict anything. In a month we'll know a lot more.Meantime, Trump is a canny self-promoter who has tapped into an electoral gusher, but is a loose cannon (as we saw last Saturday) who would be a bad president. Anybody who is in favor of cleaning out the combination cesspool and snake pit we have in the nation's capital needs to support Cruz ASAP, because he has demonstrated that is his son intention. Plus, he is a Constitutionalist and a fighter, which the nation sorely needs in what is turning into a constitutional crisis.Cruz is the thinking man's Trump.Cruz for President.</comment>

<comment>Then, the thinking man is out-thinking himself in this instance. Trump is the only Trump of this election, not Ted H1B Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Trump and Cruz are both out-of-control nuts.  Nuclear armageddon nuts.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz... is that you?</comment>

<comment>Got any proof of that?</comment>

<comment>Kasich is simply a mild-mannered Gingrich. He's as retro as the other Republican candidates.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps.  But mild-mannered Gingrich is still better than a reality show carnival barker and the self-righteous, human-like reptilian.</comment>

<comment>That's not saying much, of course. :)</comment>

<comment>"You pays your money and you takes your choices." In this case a Hobson's Choice.    (By the way, Gingrichism is awful, as it has proved over time to be hypocritical, corrupt, anti-productive, polarizing, and self-defeating. Recall how Gingrich was ousted by his own people and had adulterous affairs because he was so busy serving the people.)</comment>

<comment>Gingrich is about 100 times better than any of these clowns</comment>

<comment>Gingrich is a miserable hypocrite just like every other GOP politician.  Preach holier-than-thou family values and the sanctity of marriage, then cheat on not one but two deathly ill wives and dump them.  If I was Mrs. Gingrich #3, I'd schedule a consult with a top divorce lawyer after every doctor's visit.</comment>

<comment>That's all true, but it's also still true that Gingrich is 100 times better.</comment>

<comment>So you are saying Gingrich is only 69 times better than Trump or Cruz?</comment>

<comment>yup he was awful on almost every levelyou misinterpret me.   I was saying how appalling it is the GOP has gotten even worse than Gingrich</comment>

<comment>Mrs. Gingrich #3, is that you??</comment>

<comment>Your profile photo, a famous image of a Syrian girl taken after a bombing, and your profile name, "Daddy's Girl", are deeply incongruous.  And not in a good, thought provoking way.I guess maybe you're making a tiresome statement about war, or something.  It's not working.  Perhaps the tone is a bit too flip for a photo of a bloody child.</comment>

<comment>Pedo, probably.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, right.  You guys are swimming in the shallow end of the gene pool.  Trump supporters?</comment>

<comment>Daddy's Girl? So of course you are for Bernie Slander's, looking for a Daddy Figure to Pay Your Way Through Life!!</comment>

<comment>Kasich has terrible policies like the rest of them.  He just hides the crazy and hatred better during debates. </comment>

<comment>Kasich is as terrifying as the rest. He wasn't to start a "Department of Judeo-Christian Values" in our military, to "spread Christian thought across the world", AKA a Crusade.</comment>

<comment>So, who's your daddy? Bernie Sanders? Or Hillary Clinton? Oh, I know. Janet Reno.</comment>

<comment>That's what's so scary. This crowd makes Romney look good. Or Bush Sr.Anyway, by next week, we should be down to four candidates. Maybe three.</comment>

<comment>"They let the nut jobs take over their party."You ever listened to Bernie describe how his tax plan "works"?</comment>

<comment>Its more detailed than Trump's !</comment>

<comment>But it's not as yoooooooge.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.Neither of them should be President.We don't need insane, screaming Septuagenarians running America</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the only smart vote is the one for Hillary Clinton, quite possibly the most corrupt, greedy, pathologically dishonest psychopath ever to run for public office. She's already proven she can sell out the American people better than anyone - while in office, no less! - with the incredibly crooked and nation-betraying Clinton Foundation. Or, of course, we can finally have the Soviet Socialist Republic of America by electing Sanders.Yep, no nuts in the Democratic Party. No sir. Trustworthy all the way.</comment>

<comment>Of course that is all a bunch of wing nut lies you are spewing.</comment>

<comment>As it stands now, the only Republicans I can see myself voting for are either Kasich or Rubio. Clinton will never get my vote, and I do not believe Sanders is going to get the nomination.What third parties are out there? I haven't voted for one since 1980 (John Anderson). Maybe it's time to do so again.</comment>

<comment>But we CAN trust Trump.  Alone among republican presidential candidates, Trump has shown he wears his heart on his sleeve.  Trump is ALONE in his de-bunking, at least among republican candidates, of the phony 5.9% unemployment government-generated statistic.  The government's own U-6 unemployment figure is nearer 17%.  Trump alone criticized the climate deal that allows China to cheat for another 19 years while mandating a host of poison pills for the American consumer, worker, and producer. Trump's followers don't like being told by cynical belt-way-insider bureau-creatures that it's perfectly O.K. to force them to give up their livelihoods in furtherance of more H1B and H1C visa opportunities for the "Kumars", "Wangs", and "el Muchacho" "sem documentacao".  Marco Rubio wants MORE H1b and H1C visas, even said so during the first debate.  Kasich is a former Lehman Brothers insider.  He is literally rotten to his scurvy core.  Carson is just pathetic, as is Jeb!, the dukeless turtle.   Cruz is not eligible, according to the U.S. Constitution to be President, as he is NOT a native-born citizen, period, end of story.  "Robio" does not compute and wears Gaylord boots to boot.  Hillary due to be indicted in March, for a slew of Federal Crimes.  They say Bernie gets some "crossover" votes.  Yeah, that's 'cause he looks as though he's about to croak from old age and pass over from this life into the next.</comment>

<comment>Do you just make this stuff up as you go along? The current U-6 rate is 9.9%.http://portalseven.com/employm...And the current unemployment rate as usually reported is 4.9%http://data.bls.gov/timeseries...</comment>

<comment>Trump's right, you're government figures are not.  Trump is winning in all the polls.  Your beltway narrative is toast, Johnny, boy, Trump is winning and it's going to be in a historical landslide.</comment>

<comment>Please do nominate Trump. It will be a historic landslide, for sure.Honestly, he does have a good side to his candidacy. He's shining a light on how completely captured by its donor class the regular Republican party is, completely ignoring working men and women.Of course, there's another party that works a lot harder for working men and women, getting health care for working folks, blocking the Repub-voted Ryan plan for destroying SS and Medicare, and not spending all the grandkids' money on tax cuts for billionaires. It's called the Democrats. As soon as y'all stop being so reflexively racist, you will realize where you belong. http://www.economist.com/news/...With all that tax cutting for the rich going on the kids' tab, of course, because Trump hasn't offered any spending cuts nearly large enough to pay for any of it. </comment>

<comment>Trump's followers are idiots.  And you are Exhibit A.</comment>

<comment> "Kasich might be the best equipped to actually govern, but there are much better choices on the other side of the aisle Bernie never ran anything other than the small college town of Burlington, and Hillary's record - though more substantial than that of Trump, Cruz or Rubio -  is mediocre at best.</comment>

<comment>Oi, Doutor,Que nada!  Kasich e Sanders sao os maiores safados!  Sem vergonha nenhum, cara.  Apoio o "Donald", pois com certeza ele vai ganhar.  Bernie thinks "global warming" is the biggest problem we face.  LOL.  And Hillary 'bout to be indicted, yo.</comment>

<comment>Better choices on the other side?  A woman who willingly exposed classified information to the Chinese and Russians and then sold limited American Uranium to the Russians.  Sanders, who suggests that the US will bejust like Denmark when he taxes the middle class into oblivion (hey when your spending that kind of money the tax on the wealthy can only bleed into a lower income range) while the leaders of Denmark explain tell him he is full of crap. http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/17/...</comment>

<comment>Wow.  You are really drinking the Kool Aid, aren't you?  I guess stupid is as stupid does.</comment>

<comment>Isn't it time everyone starts calling Trump's campaign exactly what it is - just another bond offering predicated upon exaggerated claims and inflated rates of return.  This time, however, when he fails to be able to deliver on the promises, there's no Bankruptcy Court available to cover his ass.</comment>

<comment>"...All these men are carrying grudges that losing might only inflame..."The GOP is in a bind because they didn't call out the crazies, but instead double-down on seeing who can be crazier. Toxic idiots like Palin, O'Reilly, Limbaugh, etc poisoned the GOP long before someone like Trump came along.You reap what you sow... now choke on it.</comment>

<comment>as opposed to the Democrat/Socialists?  You have the 1%er Hillapottomus buying the election, and you have the Socialist Bernie promising bigger, more intrusive government and massive tax hikes which will destroy the economy.</comment>

<comment>as opposed to the Democrats?LOL are you even watching the Republican debates or have you possibly gone deaf in the past few months due to all the shouting filth on the GOP podiums?</comment>

<comment>or you mean the traitor hillary who broke numerous laws on handling top secret data?  Or the hillary buying delegates?  or the hillary lying daily?  Or the bernie lying daily?  or the bernie offering free stuff with no way to pay for it?</comment>

<comment>Sorry I can't hear you over all the noise. Let me know when someone is found guilty in the court of law on something.Until then I'll continue to support the candidate with the most experience and grace on the field.</comment>

<comment>so you do not support Hillapottamus or Bernie, right?  Trump is by far the most qualified of any of the Repulocrat candidates.  Although Gary Johnson would be the best choice.</comment>

<comment>That kind of deep critical thinking is why the GOP is so much fun to watch right now.Please do nominate Trump, it would be a shining example of what the GOP has degenerated into.</comment>

<comment>Trump is far better than Hillapottamus or Bernie, but that is not saying much.  Hillpottamus is a lying, traitor who would be in federal prison if her last name is not Clinton.  The Socialist Bernie would be loads of laughs to watch as he craters the economy with all his "free" stuff. But hey, why let reality get in the way of your progressive/socialist/communist fantasies.</comment>

<comment>GOP talking points #1, #2, and #3.Good-job spewing the same filth the GOP candidates have been.Anyone with a brain can see through GOP led investigations into Benghazi and her email server as the self felatio fluff it is.Nothing will lead to a guilty verdict in court and nothing will stop a Democrat from taking the white house. That's the reality of the situation. I don't expect you to accept it though, as the GOP continues to fight battles on abortion, the ACA, and marriage long after they have already lost.</comment>

<comment>That's why they don't need policy. When your voters only react to talking points why give them actual policy. </comment>

<comment>A quick perusal of history (beginning with Nixon at the least) will show that the republicans have been sore losers for a long time ;)</comment>

<comment>Hillary is literally buying the Democrat nomination with each backroom deal she makes with superdelegates. With the exception of the Cruz campaign, at least the GOP primaries are open and honest in their vote counts.</comment>

<comment>"literally buying" huh?Yeah... please send over the receipts on those purchases. I'm guessing the FOX new website you read these deals about on can provide the source, oh they can't cause its all made up? No worries I figured.And who cares about GOP vote counts? They have absolutely no chance of obtaining the Presidency. What is the point of even bringing it up. No GOP candidate will garner the majority needed and it will be a shit-fest at the convention. Now that's what you should be talking about.</comment>

<comment>http://observer.com/2016/02/ho...Thirty three states and counting.</comment>

<comment>If that's the definition of "literally buying" to you, then every Republican is literally bought and paid for by the Koch brothers.</comment>

<comment>Except Trump, the leading GOP candidate, just won New Hampshire and is going to win South Carolina and Nevada, and he didnt get any Koch money.</comment>

<comment>run along back to fox news, child</comment>

<comment>bigger government is more intrusive by definition, my low information progressive puppet.</comment>

<comment>No it's not. Such a statement is ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Limbaugh and Palin are FAR more right wing than O'Reilly is.  Come on now.</comment>

<comment>We Conservatives honor democracy and capitalism. We are enjoying the primary process, and we will emerge with the next President of the United States. Then we have the big job of reversing everything this sad excuse of a President has done. Hopefully, we will be successful in putting Americans back to work, deporting illegal aliens, securing our border, building our military, and reducing/gutting the Federal government to a barely noticeable existence. Hopefully, we will restore the power to the states and individuals and decentralize government. Hopefully, we will reinvigorate the economy by increasing competitors in the marketplace through lower taxes and less regulations. Hopefully, we will remove large swaths of government agencies and slash spending by huge amounts. Ultimately, we will reduce the federal deficit to nothing, pass balanced budget amendments, term limits for Congress, and more. Hopefully, we will nominate and confirm conservative Justices to the Supreme Court and make criminals pay for their crimes.It's a good day for America.</comment>

<comment>The orange bloated one is a liberal. I respect his game for making believers out of people like you. But then again, the make up of his base is well documented and it rhymes with 'uneducated white males'.I give you exhibit A:On the way out, I spoke to 35-year-old John Jones, who had come to the rally with his mother, father, and sister. “If he don’t win, this country’s done. We’re over,” he said.“The Pope is a nutcase,” his father, Harry Jones, volunteered. “All they are is a cult. They’re not Christians. He’s a zero. He’s a commie. He’s as useless as tits on a boar hog.” The Joneses are Baptists.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that Trump is a liberal or a conservative, per se. He is a chameleon who changes color to suit his target audience. His target audience at the moment just happens to be angry bigots and right-wing authoritarians. He's a faux populist taking advantage of the mess created by Republican party strategists, fringe internet pundits and A.M. radio howlers.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't change color. He's always, consistently, orange. I agree with the rest of your comment though.</comment>

<comment>Ha</comment>

<comment>Thing is Trump is not getting stronger.  He's been doing his shtick for nearly a year and his support is topped out at 30%.  Even as the republican field has begun to thin out, he's still locked at 30%.All of his histrionics have done little to broaden his appeal (something he'll have to do if he actually wants to be president).  He's just made the crazy wing of the republican party even more crazy.</comment>

<comment>RCP average has him back up to 35 after dipping in Dec. That's SC, nationally he looks to be climbing back to 35. Detailed exit poll analysis has said he has inroads into all the R 'lanes'. The big news IMHO is the new voters he has brought to the table.In short, I think he has capacity to get stronger, his ceiling is not known yet. Pass the popcorn.</comment>

<comment>still his disapproval numbers are among the lowest in the bunch.Guess we'll have to see where things fall.  I think its likely Carson and Bush will drop after SC.  Kaisch seems to be getting a bit of a bump since last debate.</comment>

<comment>Yep. People have been talking about why he ought to implode, according to conventional wisdom, since nearly the beginning of the cycle, and it hasn't happened yet. They talk now about him hitting a ceiling, but I'm not sure I see it. According to conventional wisdom, he shouldn't be picking up a share of Christie voters, but he appears to be doing so.No, I think that once it becomes clear he's the strongest candidate, he's going to pick up support just based on that. The more he comes in first, the more he adds to that cloak of inevitability. If he wins South Carolina, he goes on to get the nomination - even the conventional wisdom says that. No candidate in the past 50 years that's won 2 of the first three contests has ever failed to get their party's nomination.</comment>

<comment>trump needs more than 40% of the latino vote, you are laughable</comment>

<comment>Not at all true.http://www.realclearpolitics.c...</comment>

<comment>and who hasn't trump insulted, try reality some timelatino's, women,  muslims, and he sure won't get the black vote</comment>

<comment>Play out the scenarios. The black vote does not matter.</comment>

<comment>in your mind it doesn't</comment>

<comment>In a context where presidential elections are decided on a margin of 4 or 5 percentage points, every demographic is important.</comment>

<comment>Are you kiddin'? The negroes love Trump. He's gettin' 70, maybe 80% of the negro vote. Trump 2016!!!</comment>

<comment>you are dumber than a sack of doorknobs</comment>

<comment>You libturds will be crying on election day when President Trump gets 90% of the LEGAL Mexican vote and 80% of the negro vote!</comment>

<comment>libturds? okay, so now we know you can't post like a grownup</comment>

<comment>I just tell it like it is. No PC communist marxist muslim gaymosexual political correctness. It's ruining my Country.</comment>

<comment>you dumb kids, if you couldn't use words like communistand marxist, you wouldn't be able to post at all</comment>

<comment>Disingenuous motherfuckers.</comment>

<comment>You mean the staff and commenters here?  So rude of you!</comment>

<comment>You're being far too kind.</comment>

<comment>How do you access the Internet from a dingy urine-reeking San Francisco alley?</comment>

<comment>so your still hanging out in the schoolyard?</comment>

<comment>Ah, another morning at Team Democrat Blog.  Atlantic political commentary is best viewed as cheerleading for you team in the Super Bowl.</comment>

<comment>The GOP field is like having a choice of venereal diseases to vote for.</comment>

<comment>Says "nutjob"</comment>

<comment>you have some really great stupid going on, kid</comment>

<comment>Feel the Bern sounds like Chlamydia.</comment>

<comment>With Bernie what you think is a urinary tract infection is bladder cancer.</comment>

<comment>*clap, clap, clap*</comment>

<comment>Can't stump the Trump.</comment>

<comment>Liberals love Trump.</comment>

<comment>Hilarious to see Atlantic pointing and shrieking already at the right.  What you're really afraid of is Trump.</comment>

<comment>I hope the Dumpster actually gets the GOP nomination, November 9 will show us the biggest defeat of a GOP nominee since Goldwater, a liberal President and a democratically controlled Senate and a lot of right wing nut jobs jumping out of windows in despair... I can hardly wait</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders will get destroyed just like George McGovern did. To think Trump will lose to either Democrat candidate shows how far out of touch with reality so many upper class leftists are. The potential for a political realignment where working class Democrats abandon the party for the populism of Trump is a very real threat to the status quo of both parties.</comment>

<comment>Trump being nominated means both choices are Democrats.</comment>

<comment>"Grossed out" isn't the same as afraid.  The kids on the playground may run away from the kid who eats worms, but not necessarily because they're scared of him.</comment>

<comment>As a liberal Democrat, I've been rooting for Trump since Day One, knowing THAT was fun and entertaining, but not show-up-to-the-polls-Presidential-material.</comment>

<comment>Jokes on you then.</comment>

<comment>you have to be pretty politically stupid to think trump can win</comment>

<comment>I would say you were more politically stupid to think that a fat old lady, who nobody trusts and who can't even beat an old socialist jew, can win.But we shall see.</comment>

<comment>fat old lady? can't you post like a grownup, kid?</comment>

<comment>Doth the shoe fit? Whatever shall I do with this shoe that doth fit?</comment>

<comment>I'll take that as "no"</comment>

<comment>Remove from anus and place in mouth.</comment>

<comment>Literally anyone capable of rational thought is at least a little scared of Trump.</comment>

<comment>LITERALLY!  Why, it's the current year!</comment>

<comment>hey, goober, trump can't win</comment>

<comment>Dude, no liberal is "afraid" of Trump. 1) he's a terrible gen election candidate, and 2) even if he did win, he's the most liberal (by far - pro choice, pro gay marriage, pro healthcare reform, anti war, and on and on and on) of the Republicans running.</comment>

<comment>Liberals are afraid of everything.  It's why so many of you are on meds.</comment>

<comment>Taking this race to its logical conclusion, the Republican primaries will end in a shootout live on stage.</comment>

<comment>the party convention will feature the remaining candidates on a paintball course, only with live ammo, having a tournament, the winner gets the nomination.</comment>

<comment>Who is going to be the first Republican candidate to wear a Confederate Flag lapel pin at a public appearance in SC? I mean Atwater has been dead for 25 years, more than enough time to drop all that politically correct, coded language and swing the pendulum back all the way to Wallace type depravity.</comment>

<comment>Trump will emerge the winner, or the GOP will be destroyed.  Either way it's a win.</comment>

<comment>I believe it's not an "either or" but an "or and".</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>True. The GOP has been needing an intervention ever since the fake alignment with the "religious right". It's time they sat down and pushed themselves to come up with a new game plan that doesn't rely on fake religiosity and bigotry and tax cuts for billionaires. Maybe those of us who used to vote right half the time can find something worthwhile on that side of the aisle again.</comment>

<comment>The GOP is perfectly set up to engender the results we see. It created shock troops to do dirty work (TEA Party) and lost control. It fostered a Rightwing Propaganda Machine (FOX, rightwing radio, et alia) and lost control. It pushed through Citizens United and lost control to a few plutocrats. It let Trump promote himself through the Obama Birth Cert. Canard and lost control. And so on. Nobody of any merit is in charge of this particular clusterfcku.</comment>

<comment>By November you will realize that clusterfukc is actually a tsunami.</comment>

<comment>You do mean that the GOP will drown itself, yes? That's a bit harsh. More likely it will get very wet and a few will metaphorically die from exposure. The GOP will morph and stay alive in some stunted state of disfunction.</comment>

<comment>I hope it's really an atom bomb, and will clean the streets of s**tlib riff-raff.</comment>

<comment>Watch out for collateral damage. The GOP has a habit of bombing itself, too.</comment>

<comment>I'm not GOP.</comment>

<comment>American Nazi Party maybe?</comment>

<comment>So in your view bombs only kill people left of center. How does that work?</comment>

<comment>The revolution devours its children.</comment>

<comment>From the Tea Party to Black Lives Matter, the Right and Left have lost their minds. The radicals have taken over both sides. The rule of law must hold, including environmental regulations and laws against violent crime. If not, the US is done.</comment>

<comment>The groups that Nixon and later Reagan aligned themselves with in a deal with the devil to win elections have now taken over the GOP. None of those two groups (the Walllace voters, the Religious Right) are strong enough to win primaries, let alone elections, on their own. But they will make things miserable for the establishment. </comment>

<comment>There's barely an attractive candidate in this race (on either side), but Ted Cruz is the single most noxious major candidate in 40+ years. Patrick Buchanan was close, but he was at least sincere, and his face infinitely less punchable.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is profoundly ugly. What possessed him to take up politics?</comment>

<comment>Screwing the American people looks pretty good to a guy who's wife's a Goldman Sachs earner. </comment>

<comment>There's an old adage that politicians are people who want to be famous but are too ugly for show business.</comment>

<comment>Well, that fits Cruz, certainly. He's Greg Stillson, personified.</comment>

<comment>Yes. And it's stupid.</comment>

<comment>The chance to do evil.</comment>

<comment>It's not so much that he's physically ugly, as he's just so odious and ugly in terms of personality. Even Nixon could be personable and charming - Cruz just seems skeezy right from the get-go.</comment>

<comment>Why does his appearance matter?</comment>

<comment>I'm constantly mixing Marco Rubio up with Mark Consuelos, who plays him on Alpha House.</comment>

<comment>Up until now, I have not been able to pinpoint why I absolutely can't look at Ted Cruz but you've hit the proverbial nail on the head. This is it. Thank you!</comment>

<comment>OK, libs, time to signal your moral superiority.  Atlantic comment thread is OPEN.</comment>
