<comment>Although the article is making this observation about GCT after gay marriage has gained widespread acceptance, I think it actually happened the other way. The discredidation of gay conversion therapy was a necessary condition for gay marriage to gain the widespread support it has today. And it wasn't the result of scientific studies that GCT was discredited. The key was that, after slowly building for decades, a critical mass had been reached of gay men and women who had come out to their friends and families, causing them to see gay people as loved ones, not just the subjects of news stories.</comment>

<comment>AIDS saved the gay man. It really forced the 'gay life' into the spotlight. We had a problem that was killing pretty white girls and we couldn't just ignore it - or else.They say sunlight is the best disinfectant, well AIDS shone a whole lot of sunlight on gays. People realized it wasn't that bad. They were forced to interact with it in non-destructive ways to accomplish a societal objective.AIDS moved 'gay' forward and out of the darkness where it had lurked for ages.</comment>

<comment>Xira, your comment is bizarre.</comment>

<comment>Why? It's fairly coherent - AIDS came along and forced a closeted population into the public sphere, and leaders had to work with said population to achieve a goal, and thus people realized it wasn't all that bad.</comment>

<comment>How old were you in the 1980s?  What I remember is that due to AIDS, homophobia, in a literal sense, ruled the day.Not to mention, "AIDS saved the gay man." is inexplicable on the face of it.  Who or what is "the gay man"?  All of the gay men who suffered and died, and their families grieved, and the babies born with AIDS ... what a heartless statement you made.  There's no bright spot on this cloud.</comment>

<comment>Sure, there was reactionary homophobia, and that also moved gay rights forward. In the same way that police dogs biting children protestors moved black rights forward.Sometimes there's a silver lining. I understand the emotional appeal of "this thing is _BAD_ so it can never do anything good" but that's reactionary and blatantly false.</comment>

<comment>It's not emotional."AIDS saved the gay man." is an indefensible statement.</comment>

<comment>In next weeks edition, we will discuss how the Bubonic Plague saved Europe.</comment>

<comment>The plague actually had an historically significant positive impact: with less people, labor became more valuable, which helped lead to the end of the feudal system.</comment>

<comment>You must love war.</comment>

<comment>I'm not happy about death by any means, but the Black Plague is what thrust Europe out of the feudal system in a relatively short amount of time.</comment>

<comment>Well it certainly reordered the class system.</comment>

<comment>No.</comment>

<comment>Replace "gay man" with gay-culture?</comment>

<comment>1 - Still requires some explanation - what culture exactly?  Saved from what?  What would have happened to it w/o AIDS?2 - Still not worth the toll of death and suffering.</comment>

<comment>I understand your position. I agree with you. The suffering one goes through when afflicted by AIDS, is horrible. I'm just trying to be open-minded interpreting the intent of the post. AIDS did bring gay-culture more into the general-public's eye. Who thought Rock Hudson would ever be gay? People tend to accept other lifestyles when finding out, that people they may know, or appreciate are part of a lifestyle they may have considered debauched.</comment>

<comment>I think it was happening and would have happened without AIDS.  Right before AIDS you began to see some gay performers who only half-heartedly closeted if they bothered at all.  The tide began to change then.  The epidemic was a tragedy and I don't believe it had an up-side.</comment>

<comment>AIDS saved the gay man the way Auschwitz saved Jews.</comment>

<comment>Well, the AIDS epidemic did get the public talking about the homosexual community. It did bring them out in the open. That is the one good thing about the AIDS epidemic for them. Otherwise, it was terrible, every gay person knew many people who had HIV. Now the numbers are better, but it is still a bad problem.</comment>

<comment>I think that the point you are making is the same as saying that WWII was good for Germany *in the big picture*--and it was, arguably.I can see that.</comment>

<comment>Yes. And the Jews. I probably shouldn't say this in public, but Hitler's eugenics project succeeded in creating a high-IQ race - all the Jews who were smart enough to get out of his way have a very high genetic IQ to this day.Somehow I doubt it would provide Hitler any comfort to know he succeeded in improving the gene pool of the ones he wanted exterminated.</comment>

<comment>Funny how stuff like that works.</comment>

<comment>Poe's Law??</comment>

<comment>Not in the least. That's really how a selection event works, even with human genetics.</comment>

<comment>It's amazing what hoops people will jump through to justify the failed theory of eugenics.</comment>

<comment>You are a person who does not believe in genetics...lol</comment>

<comment>Zionists make NAZIS look like reasonable and smart people.NAZIS were evil morons.One thing you got right, Hitler was the greatest genetic engineer ever.Then again, he was hired by the Zionists to persuade Jews to leave fo Palestine. Righteous Jews go to the "Holy Land"  and unrighteous Jews get slaughtered.You know, just like in Exodus 32: 27-28 - the first Holcuast of the "unrigtheous" who didn't want to go to the "Holy Land".They took that part out of all the movies.</comment>

<comment>That's the purpose of his comments, the more bizarre the more attention he can get.</comment>

<comment>I don't want to use an old cliche, but I'm in a hurry and can't think of a better macro right now, but he's "thinking outside box", inviting readers to explore what he's saying in a bit of depth.Stretches the old grey matter, a bit.</comment>

<comment>Bizarre, but may well be true.</comment>

<comment>Xira, HIV and AIDS put us back 20 years. The gay rights movement started in the late 1950s and became visible to most of America by the early 1970s. While AIDS certainly increased discussion about homosexuality almost all of it tended negative. Put bluntly, AIDS was killing all the right people back then and very few people cared.While HIV and AIDS most certainly did not move us forward politically it did force gay culture to reflect on its collective health, lifestyle, and approach to relationships. The specter of AIDS motivated many young gays back then to approach their night and love lives more cautiously, and with greater respect for serial monogamy.</comment>

<comment>There's more though.It forced straight people (myself among them) thru an actual consideration of what it was like to be gay--very superficially, but thinking about homosexuality at all was a major break thru.In the process much vileness came out: there was a lot of "well, this is what they get, huh?". But concomitantly, one had to also see the loss expressed within the gay community, and this loss was human. This was understandable to straights.And perhaps for the first time, straights may have begun to view gays as co-equals.I can remember going out with my wife (then girl friend) in West Hollywood, in ~1985, thinking "A bunch if these people are gonna die, and they know it. And their loved ones know it, also."Things about humans are very complex.</comment>

<comment>This article is not in any way about AIDS. Let's get back on track.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't say that AIDS was the factor that was the force that allowed gay men into the spotlight.  Many gay men were increasingly more "out" many years prior to this and as a result a real sexual revolution was taking place in the gay community.  In fact, then AIDS started its devastating effects, there were many voices in the gay community that called for more sexual restraint - the opposition of which was large since the leaders felt that gay men were finally being seen and heard and that restricting sex would be tantamount to regression.AIDS was seen by many conservative people as an act from God and  since the gay community is like many communities with common beliefs, the heterosexual community was mostly oblivious to the devastation.  Only when it spread into heterosexuals did people really start to look and seek to find a reason and cure.  Haemophiliacs, blood transfused women, etc started to be effected and that's when the focus for a cure shifted.  Regina refused to promote condom used and safe sex and instead sought to prevent AIDS/HIV into the USA and the White House promoted abstinence.Indeed, Black men in Chicago blamed Jewish doctors who, they thought, were infecting them and their kids.http://articles.latimes.com/19...So - I wouldn't say that it was the reason that led to being gay out of the darkness - in many aspects it was a reason to repress and marginalize. </comment>

<comment>Yeah.  I remember in the 1970s before AIDS, Freddie Mercury and the Village People.  It's not like gay people were invisible before AIDS, or universally demonized.</comment>

<comment>Do you remember the myth about the gay flight attendant who allegedly caused the AIDS epidemic that was being touted at the time? it was a modern day version of the Jews poisioning wells stories from the middle ages. The hysteria and hatred was overwhelming.</comment>

<comment>I remember that very well.  And poor Ryan White.  It was one thing for Ryan to not attend school, since it was not clear at all how transmissible HIV was at that time and no one wants to put children at risk, but the shaming he got for being gay when he actually wasn't, he got HIV from a blood transfusion b/c he was a hemophiliac, was an outrage.  I mean, it would have been an outrage if he was gay, but the fact that he wasn't but he got that anyway is indicative of a lot of people's mindset at the time.I guess you had to live through this stuff to have any perspective now.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for your kind words and clear memory of those times. I will put it to you that many people back then were very happy that gay men were dying of AIDS. Many today share the same sentiment.</comment>

<comment>I think the people who were happy were mostly thinking about it in the abstract, that their notions about what was or wasn't normal and healthy were being confirmed.  I don't think that, faced with actual friends and family members getting sick, people they were forced to think of as real human beings, they were necessarily happy.  It's a thing humans do, to dehumanize people whom it's not convenient to give a damn about, when we don't have to look and think "what if that was me".  Black folks, especially prior to the Civil War.  Jews in Europe in the 1930s.  From my pro-life perspective, unborn children.  If every gay person a straight person knows is firmly in the closet, and that straight person has little natural empathy or imagination, they're going to go there.  I don't know how evil that makes them.  Sometimes I see people like that and I feel sorry for them, that part of their soul is missing.</comment>

<comment>People are as opportunistic, selfish, petty, cruel, and exploitative as they are let to be. We only become noble and fair with the possibility of gain or the threat of punishment. In my experience, the "dehumanizing" of which you speak is our default view of others until we're given a reason to care. Don't feel sorry for those without empathy. Those folks are either so strong or so privileged never to have developed any.</comment>

<comment>Also, I'd like to recommend this excellent book for anyone who wants the history of this stuff.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. No gays were being strung up because of ''Patient X''.And besides, you people were not helping matters by continuing NOW, as THEN, to only spread the disease even more.</comment>

<comment>As you have readily seen, the more ''educating'', the more HIV .Explain this paradox.Lucidly, and without your boilerplate BS.</comment>

<comment>Wow.</comment>

<comment>This is NOT an article about AIDS. It is an article about gay conversion therapy not working and being rejected by every major medical association and every major ex-gay ministry.</comment>

<comment>I think there's a lot of truth in this.Back in the 80's, there were two competing  movements in the United Methodist Church. One group called themselves "transforming congregations" and the other called themselves "reconciling congregations". Neither group was very large; most congregations did not belong to either of them. The reconciling movement started with only two congregations. The "transforming" groups were openly supporting gays and lesbians who wanted to change their orientation, while the reconciling movement aimed to welcome and support all LBGTQ persons. Fast forward 30 years, and the transforming movement is long gone. It had no successes. The reconciling movement now includes over 300 congregations and campus ministries. Even more importantly, there are gays and lesbians in hundreds of churches that never officially joined the movement, but still welcome everyone.Most of those congregations had exactly the experience you describe - they got to know gays and lesbians as real people, and not whatever stereotype they may have held. The transforming movement is now in the dustbin of history, where it belongs.</comment>

<comment>I'm someone who has experienced a change in my orientation through the work of Christ and the help of a ministry that is still going strong today.  (Harvest USA in Philadelphia.)  I'm currently attending a United Methodist Church, and was raised in one.  It is difficult being a part of a congregation that does not recognize that you exist.  To see the redeeming and transforming work of Christ abandoned by the denomination you're a part of is heart-wrenching.</comment>

<comment>Leelah Alcorn's suicide was a terrible thing.  Just for clarification's sake - from my understanding this individual was dealing primarily with gender dysphoria, no homosexuality per se.  (And please correct me if I'm wrong on that.)  One of the things that I mention on my blog (https://sswh.wordpress.com/) is how very important one's motivation is in the process.  No one should be forced to undergo therapy against their wishes.  It doesn't work that way.  And this is one of the concerns we need to keep in mind...no one should be forced to seek change against their wishes, and no one should be forced to not seek change against their wishes.  We should all be allowed autonomy in our ability to seek counseling.</comment>

<comment>Not to diminish your experience, but the fact remains that the vast majority of persons who have attempted this sort of therapy have not experienced a change in their orientation and have been harmed by the message that the way they are is wrong. If you are happy, then I am happy for you, but please try to understand that your experience is definitely somewhat of a fluke.</comment>

<comment>We don't ban talk therapies in the United States.There are hundreds of such modalities.None are banned.   Where did you get the idea that we can ban talk therapies?</comment>

<comment>This is about banning therapies for people who are questioning their sexuality or are confused, it's about banning a practice that has been condemned by every major psychological institution in the nation for being ineffective and harmful.  More importantly, this will prevent well-meaning parents from inflicting harm on their LGBT kids by forcing them to go through these disproven "therapies".</comment>

<comment>I have some significant First Amendment concerns about prohibiting a counselor from speaking or punishing him based on the content of his message or upon the viewpoint that he advocates.In the case of a minor client, however, who may be coerced or who is insufficiently mature to discern and reject the therapist's bullish!t, that prohibition may be justified under even strict scrutiny review.</comment>

<comment>If a major organization promised to cure your kids of having green eyes and they took tens of thousands of dollars from you, you would be taking them to court when you found out this was all a scam and those selling it knew it.</comment>

<comment>*this ISN'T about,</comment>

<comment>Promising to "cure" that which is not illness is fraud (as proven in court where facts are required). the word "therapy" means "to cure an illness" but sexual orientation is not illness. Homophobic prejudice is the illness. Google "homophobes suffer from mental illness"</comment>

<comment>Apparently you are totally unaware that people go to therapists for reasons such as marriage counselling, work problems, shyness, nervousness about public speaking, and lots of everyday issues that are not diseases.These people simply want help with their lives, feelings and behavior.</comment>

<comment>Jon Dietrich - I don't feel slighted by your comment, and thank you for sharing your thoughts.  The truth is that no one really knows for sure how many people have been helped vs. those who have not.  There have only been a handful of studies done, and all of those have poor selection bias issues.  In those studies that have been done I am aware that a minority experienced a significant change in their orientation.  However, I've not found that there has been a significant enough sample taken to be definitive in the work that we do have to date.  One of the reasons I have for this is that in my experience, most of the people I know who have experienced change and have gone on to marry and have kids want nothing to do with their old life.  Only a few people in their lives know that they've ever been attracted to the same gender in the past.  They want to blend in, and it would be hard to get them to even participate in an anonymous survey.  But, as things stand now with all that we do know, it's easy for me to see how you and others may view my experience as a fluke.  I would like to see what can be done to not make it such a unique experience.  I think that we have much to learn about the fluidity of sexual orientation, and denying that it is possible, at least for some, isn't helping anyone learn anything.</comment>

<comment>Your opinions are counter cultural. And unwelcome.You don't go with the flow.That's the preserve of dead fish.</comment>

<comment>"Other than a few bisexual lesbians, I would say 99.9% of Christians seeking a change from homosexual to heterosexual," admitted Alan Chambers, long-time president of the only worldwide ex-gay network, Exodus International. Now that group and all the other major Christian ministries with decades of "change" promises have also faded into history. Jesus never spoke a word against homosexuality during his life, and Jesus never changed a homosexual into a heterosexual, admitted John Smid, long-time leader of Love in Action, the oldest ex-gay ministry (and the only one with a year-long, live-in program to cure Christians of homosexuality).</comment>

<comment>I think the clinical name for someone who can be exposed to therapy and change orientation is "bisexual." Sexuality seems to be a continuum, with some people at the poles--confirmed straights or confirmed gays-- and a number of people spread out closer to the center. As long as you're happy with where you are and no one else is harmed, I say more power to you.</comment>

<comment>Christians Love - "debatey" - Ha!  That's a new one!  (You get two bonus points for that, for those keeping score.)  From the rest of what you've written, I can tell that you've never met anyone working with Harvest USA, and you're not quite up to speed on the history of the ex-gay movement.  But, to be honest, not many people are up to speed on that, I'm afraid.  The folks I know at Harvest USA are humble, well-educated, caring individuals - none of whom have told me or anyone else to deny what they were feeling at any moment in time.  The funny part of your blanket condemnation is that of all the ministries I've known, Harvest USA is the nerdiest.  Their staff may have more credentials / degrees than any other.  And they are far from condemning.  I've seen instances in group counseling sessions when I thought, "OK, here it comes - it's about to hit the fan..." and the group leader simply listened and continued to ask open-ended questions without a hint of negativity in her tone.  I remember the rest of the women in the group and I looking at one another in wonder...  It was amazing to see the maturity displayed and the dependence on the Holy Spirit to work in someone's life.  No manipulation tactics or low blows, either.  They are an amazing group of people, and I'm so glad I was able to go there for help when I did.</comment>

<comment>Well, that puts you on a short list of people whom you couldpossibly be…Michael Bussee?  If so, nice to meet you – although I think we may have met before a long time ago on an internet far away, back when AOL and dial-up were all the rage.  And I’m familiar with your story.  (If this isn’t Michael Bussee, my apologies, but I don’t know who else you could be – you’re not Frank Worthen or Ron Glass!)Yes, I know Alan Chambers, too, and I remember that particular TV show which you’ve mentioned.  He wasthe last president of Exodus, although I wouldn’t describe him as “the long-time” leader.  He was one of a number of former presidents of Exodus who continue to have something in common, curiously enough.  Frank Worthen, Alan Medinger, Sy Rodgers, Joe Dallas, Bob Davies, and Alan Chambers are all still happily married to their wives.  (With the exception of Alan Medinger – his wife passed before he did, I believe within a year after her death.)  It stillseems strange to me to hear Alan Chambers talk about his love for Leslie and attractions for her, and then turn around and say that he never met anyone who experienced a change in their attractions.As for the leader of Love in Action – you mean John Smid –we’re friends on Facebook, and yes, he did leave the ministry.  However, you’re wrong about there not beingany ministries in Europe – I know of two off the top of my head, as well as a ministry in Australia.  (It seems thenews of the movement’s ultimate demise have been rather exaggerated.)  I don’t assume that I know it all, but I doknow a few things.One thing that I did not know was that you’re related tosomeone who has worked for Harvest USA – that is news to me.  (Although I don’t exactly keep a file of the relatives of everyone on staff, so it’s not that shocking.)  I am confused, though, about your description of that ministry…they are certainly not anti-intellectual – again, of all the ministries I know they would be the last to fit that description.  And why are you stating that they “serve up traditions of southern culture?”   They are based on a distinctly different spiritual / regional / ethical background – it would take leaps of logic to connect the work they do with the “-isms” you’ve accused them of.  I’m trying to place who your sister may be who worked there – it’s quite possible that I know her.  (Again, only a short list of possibilities.)  The thing is, I’m notaware of anyone who has worked on staff who would describe her former co-workers in this way.  I’m wondering what your sister has to say about her experience with Harvest USA…are you picking up these impressions from conversations with her?  Did your sister have a degree?  That part just doesn’t seem to fit.  (But of course, I don’t claim to know everything.)And yes, they did help me, and I give plenty of specifics onmy blog, if you’d like to read more:  https://sswh.wordpress.com/.  I recommend using the Table of Contents tab to sort through the posts.And if you are Michael Bussee, it really is nice to meetyou.  In the conversations we may well have had years ago on AOL, you were very kind to me.  You have led a very interesting life, and I can understand much of where you’re coming from, although we see things differently.  Yet I believe that there is a way forward for all of us together – there is room in this country, in this culture, to live alongside one another in mutual respect and peace.  I’d be honored to talk with you about it sometime.</comment>

<comment>A few other points I'm confused on - could you help me clarify the following?  In what capacity did your sister work for Harvest USA, and what year(s) did she work there?  And wouldn't it be more accurate for you to say that you were there near the beginning of Exodus International and near the end of it, instead of saying that you've "had 40 years in the ex-gay ministry," since you left in 1979?  Just trying to sort things out.Also, Alan had been taking steps to close down Exodus about a year prior to your meeting with him on TV.  Steps had been taken to re-arrange the Board, etc.  Harvest USA had left the network a year prior to the closing announcement.  It did come as a surprise to me, but others had seen the writing on the wall, and I'm not sure why you're implying that the TV interview had a part in the decision-making process...unless I'm just reading what you wrote incorrectly.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for the clarification that you are not Michael Bussee, although I'm still curious as to who you may be - someone involved with Exodus over 40 years who is related to a staff member at Harvest USA whom you're pretty sure I know.  Hm...how mysterious.Yes, I remember how LIA closed.  And I can understand how you would find that TV show a catalyst for the closing of Exodus.  What I was pointing out was that if the Board had not been populated as it was at the time, I'm not sure that the same decision would have been made.  Moving those people into place occurred long before then, and were part of the overall plan to close their office.</comment>

<comment>Oh - I wasn't reading you that literally.  The MAJOR ones, I see.Your characterization of the ministries that are still going strong is rather off base for someone who boasts of your knowledge of the subject.  I would have thought that you knew of the one in the Western US directed by a woman who is an ever-straight.  But back to Europe - one of the two ministries I mentioned is run by a woman who has openly discussed her continued same-sex attractions for years, and no one seems interested in firing her.  The other one is run by three men in England.  (They have a fantastic website.)  Perhaps these are all so minor to you that you've missed them entirely.</comment>

<comment>NO SUCH THING AS A HOMOSEXUAL TURNED HETEROSEXUAL, ADMITTED THE MAJOR EX-GAY MINISTRY LEADERS. HARVEST USA IS NOT A THERAPY GROUP, NOT EVEN AN EX-GAY GROUP. THEY ARE A BUNCH OF CHURCH LAYPEOPLE SPREADING PREJUDICE.</comment>

<comment>Oh - hi there, Christians Love!  I've been waiting for over a week for you to answer the other questions I'd posted elsewhere in this thread.  I wasn't sure where you'd disappeared to.  How about answering those questions before continuing on in our discussion?</comment>

<comment>So sorry - I did not get the notice that you'd replied to my other questions in the e-mail alert that was sent to me.  I tried to delete this comment asking you to answer those questions, as it is obviously not relevant, but it seems to not have been deleted.  My apologies!</comment>

<comment>Oh today I get the e-mail alert that notified me that you'd already replied to my other questions...sigh.  A day later than I could have used it.  But still, my bad for not reading through the thread.</comment>

<comment>All of these topics and more I've written about at length on my blog.  Feel free to read more there:  https://sswh.wordpress.com/</comment>

<comment>This may be true of the "transforming" movement, but the United Methodist Church is facing a schism today between the traditionalists and the progressives based primarily on the official stance on same-sex marriage and allowing openly gay clergy. Some Church leaders want to allow it, many others don't and they see their differences as irreconcilable. It's fine that people no longer endorse gay conversion, but sad that so many are still so headstrong against acceptance of gays.</comment>

<comment>True. It may take another generation or two before this prejudice is confined to the people who are going to hate anyone different no matter what.</comment>

<comment>John, why is that if someone has a different ethical position to yours that you attribute their motivation to hate? Do you hate people who have a different ethical position to your own? If so, is that rational? In a pluralist society why can't people have different ethical positions? Why can't we agree to disagree?</comment>

<comment>This is not within the DNA of the liberal-left.Behold.......https://twitter.com/anjiecast/...</comment>

<comment>Obviously you did not read the article you are commenting on. Medical science and the conservative Christians who led the ex-gay movement for decades are the ones who have been clearest THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A HOMOSEXUAL TURNED HETEROSEXUAL.</comment>

<comment>You are being hysterical and stupid at the same time. The above source has not a damned thing with ''ex-gays''.It has to do with eliminationist rhetoric that you damned hypocrites would be the first to condemn were the subjects... well....GAYS.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing ethical about gay conversion therapy. </comment>

<comment>That is your ideological position. It is not an absolute fact. If someone does not want to be same-sex attracted and they would like assistance to deal with those feelings, it is unethical not to help them. All you need to do is go on to YouTube and listen to the numerous testimonies from people who are no longer practicising homosexuals - how dare you impose your ideological position on those people and deny their right to choose. If its somehow ok for a person to 'change' their gender surgically, then why is it not ok for someone to change their orientation if they want to?</comment>

<comment>Good analysi of the situation. </comment>

<comment>I wouldn't go that far. The medical and psychiatric community had a HUGE influence on exposing the harm of GCT. Let's not forget that these research studies provided a legal basis for banning the practice, and helped successfully defend state bans (for example, Does v. Christie).</comment>

<comment>The guy with the weird name above you is pushing silly lies 25 years AFTER brain scans showed visible differences in certain brain areas for homosexuals vs heterosexuals. But he would rather blame the few LGBT folks who first spoke up in 1973 at the APA meeting than look at the fact that every medical association has found evidence that gay conversion therapy cures nobody and harms many. Gay conversion therapy has consisted of lobotomies, electro-shock and aversion therapies, such as snapping a rubber band every time one thinks a sexual thought. From the brutal to the absurd, gay conversion therapy has stubbornly clung to the past and been closed to any current scientific methodology, be it brain scan studies, the developing field of epigenetics or even the long-term studies of LGBT lives.</comment>

<comment>And yet homophobia persists in many parts of Christian community as exemplified by the Vatican's refusal to accept the credentials of the French ambassador nominee to the Vatican because he's an openly gay man. I wonder what it'll take for Christians to judge less and accept people for who they are. But for what it's worth, I'm glad that this chapter of bigotry and ignorance is coming to an end.</comment>

<comment>You are aware, aren't you, that "homophobia" means "fear of homosexuals." I'm not a Roman Catholic, but conservative Christians believe that homosexuality disqualifies a person from holding office in a Christian organisation or church—including, of course, the Vatican. So actually, it has nothing to do with fear, but with spiritual qualification. It also isn't about the silly, common pop-culture bromide of "judge not" (misquoted from the Bible by people who apparently have never read it), it's about the authority of Holy Scripture and the ontological view of man and woman as different but complementary. Be careful how you throw around the terms "bigotry" and "ignorance"—especially when yours is showing! I see plenty of bigotry going around in comment threads like this—against Christians. </comment>

<comment>Enough with your prejudice already.  I see no reason why a gay person can not hold an office in the church. You and your church make up these stupid rules to exclude people from participating because if they're not exactly like you, then they must be sub-human. Shame on you.</comment>

<comment>The only issue is if morality/rules don't begin and end with humanity. If instead they belong to a cosmic being that transcends humanity and defines morality (as the church believes) then for you to subject this deity and the beliefs of his followers to your opinion or even cultural consensus is pretty arrogant.</comment>

<comment>I beg to differ. It's one thing to believe in fairy tales, and it's another thing to subject human beings or relegate individuals to second class for who they are, because "some cosmic being" instructed you to do so, pure rubbish.</comment>

<comment>The big issue is whether it's "fairy tales" or fact. That distinction makes all the difference...</comment>

<comment>I think a question just as big as whether it's "fairly tales" or not is, have we gotten the correct message, or have infallible humans come to some wrong conclusions or have we misinterpreted what we've been told. The aspect of humans believing what they want to believe is constantly on display in forums such as this.</comment>

<comment>I think it was J. S. Mill who once said that all a god would want for human beings is their happiness. This seems right. If so, the injection of a god into discussions of morality still leaves them human-centered.</comment>

<comment>A cosmic being not subject to human conditions cannot determine "morality" for humans, just as humans cannot determine "morality" for animals.Is it "moral" for humans to destroy each other based on our pleasures and displeasures? No, it is not.Is it "moral" for a comic being to destroy humans based on its pleasures and displeasures? Yes? No? Maybe? Nobody knows? It doesn't matter anyway - humans and a cosmic being can't have the same standards of "morality", so we need to determine our standards of "morality" for ourselves and each other.</comment>

<comment>Interesting statement "a cosmic being not subject to human conditions" - Christians believe that God did become a man and understands us fully</comment>

<comment>But can we understand a cosmic being that operates on a completely different level?For instance - consider Exodus. Pharaoh won't let the Israelites leave, so angels kill the firstborn son of every Egyptian. Is this "moral"? By human standards, most definitely NO. But who's to judge if it's moral by the standards of a cosmic being? What's "moral" to this being is whatever it wants to do, and is absolutely no template for humans to follow.We can't decide that based on the actions of this "God", it's "moral" for Palestinians to kill every firstborn son in Israel until they get what they want. We must - and have - come up with standards of "morality" much more suited to humans and human understanding than what this cosmic being deems acceptable. The only way to not find this "God" character to be a completely degenerate sadist is to not judge it at all, since it obviously doesn't operate on the same plane as we do.</comment>

<comment>So do you agree with Pat Robertson that Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for New Orleans holding a gay parade?</comment>

<comment>Not only do I not agree with Pat Robertson that such a being exists, I don't agree that we could understand the motivations of such a being if it did. It's nature would be too far removed from ours.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Quite a few Christian churches also disallow women from holding church office. I grew up in one of them and it's largely the reason why I just can't step foot through a church door today. Christians love to use scripture to exude authority over oppressed groups and make themselves feel better about it.</comment>

<comment>Your logic is puzzling. Just because you "see no reason why a gay person cannot hold office in the Church" does not mean that you make the Canon Law of the Church.In fact, what if the shoe were on the other foot and I tried telling your organisation how they should set the rules and by-laws? I doubt you'd like that very much, and you'd have every right to find it ridiculous. All kinds of orgs are exclusionary, where's your calling out of the Freemasons for not allowing non-Freemasons to hold office? Or how about the Boy Scouts not allowing a 50-year-old member? Or the Daughters of the American Revolution not allowing men to join?Your attempt to shame people on the basis of their religious beliefs is pathetic and disgusting.</comment>

<comment>This is arbitrary and a transparent justification for personal bigotry, something Jesus would be appalled by. How do you justify ignoring most of the rest of the rules and regulations in the bible that time showed are useless?  Are divorced people still gong to hell Etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.I'm not against Christians, I love real Christians - was raised by them. But that's not what you are.  You're a religionist, a Christianist - a person hiding their bigotry and small mindedness behind religion.   How dare you you claim to be spiritual? Jesus knew there would always be frauds like you, he mentioned them in the Sermon on the Mount.  He'd also be the first person standing against this bigotry and you know it.Stop using bigotry and a sense of martydom for being called out for your lies. If you're peddling hate, you're merely a politician and not a Christian in any sense of the word.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that's not what homophobia means.  That's what it would mean in Greek.  BUT, in English it mean, "dislike of or hatred against gay people."An ambassador doesn't hold an office in the Church or the Vatican; he holds an office in the French Government.</comment>

<comment>Ambassadors of any country must be credentialed NOT by their own government, but by the country receiving them - which can refuse or later expel them for no grounds whatsoever, though this may cause a diplomatic row with the sending country.The Vatican is a country, incidentally, with all the trappings of one - even a (very small) military force.</comment>

<comment>I'm not disputing that.  The original poster said: "holding office in a Christian organisation or church—including, of course, the Vatican"An ambassador doesn't hold an office in a Church organization or the Vatican.</comment>

<comment>That is true, of course.  But I think we can understand what wyclif meant to say, and let's face it, if France sends an openly gay man to be ambassador to the Vatican, it is more a political statement than a serious nomination.Diplomacy is predicated on not seeking to cause offense or even awkwardness, isn't it?  One does not send a Jew to be ambassador to a Muslim country unless one wishes to provoke, after all.</comment>

<comment>"Meant to say"?  Sorry didn't realize you were a mind reader.Actually, no.  You are discussing the state of the Vatican.  Wyclif said, once again: "holding office in a Christian organization or church."The key here is that the French Ambassador doesn't hold any office "in a Christian organization or church"  The French Ambassador ACTUALLY holds office in the French Government.</comment>

<comment>I'm capable of making inferences, as I assumed (perhaps wrongly) that you are.  You may quibble with wyclif over semantics and wording - I prefer looking beyond the literal for meaning.True, he erred in fact, but what was his underlying point?  That conservative Christian entities (which the Vatican no doubt is, given its integral association with the RCC) do not necessarily wish to welcome gays into their membership, and (perhaps) would not wish to issue diplomatic credentials to them either, as their presence would present awkwardness in a sociopolitical culture that doesn't tacitly celebrate homosexuality.Do you see what I did there?  Wyclif didn't say it in so many words; he didn't need to.Then again, many people are literalists who can't even read texts like the Bible without choking on its many inconsistencies as ipso facto evidence that all of it is rubbish.  Do you do that?We are all prone to make generous allowance for major errors if we agree with the underlying premise, and if we don't, we instead fixate upon the minutiae.</comment>

<comment>"looking beyond the literal of meaning"?You mean you change the definitions of basic words like "church" to mean completely different words like "government"?Regardless of the validity of your argument, there is not one argument you are making that Wyclif said anything about.</comment>

<comment>He's an ambassador from the French government but he's also in the Vatican—clearly, the Vatican/church connection is why the ambassador can't be a homosexual. That is what I meant so don't even try twisting it.</comment>

<comment>Yes, clearly, but Jesse is getting hung on what you said, not what you're trying to say.At any rate, I get it, and have been endeavoring to make a similar point.  One doesn't just dispatch a gay ambassador to the Vatican without some deliberate intent.He could certainly be the ambassador - but not without equally deliberate credentialing by the Vatican hierarchy, and they didn't want France's gay candidate presumably because of the dissonance of Church teaching vs the tacit acceptance implied in credentialing a gay ambassador.Intolerant?  Perhaps, but not an unexpected rejection, and no doubt French leaders knew that.  The diplomatic provocation can thus be seen as deliberate.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. Your middle paragraph is essential for those with ears to hear.</comment>

<comment>"Getting hung on what you said, not what you're trying to say."That damn idiot responding to the ACTUAL words used...</comment>

<comment>Well, given that he's clarified his meaning for you now, which corresponds to the inferences I made despite his errors, are you satisfied?This is a most amusing discussion... you are probably both very intelligent people, but talking past each other entirely.  That's regrettably easy to do by the limited means of a comment space.</comment>

<comment>So, you're still saying that while he made a giant deal out of the definition of one word.  I should completely ignore the definitions of every other word he used?And when you completely change the meaning of what you say from "working for the Church" to "working for the Vatican" to "working for France and the Vatican" to "working for France at the Vatican," that's not "clarifying" that's completely changing the meaning.</comment>

<comment>When you've painted someone into a corner, Jesse, the gracious thing to do is to allow them to extricate themselves without completely losing face.You will notice wyclif disavowed his earlier posts; this should be all the admission of error required.  You've 'won.'  Now, merely help him to walk it back to a place of minimal agreement, and end in courtesy.This is the Internet, yes, but there are always human beings on the other side of the screen.  Let's not lose sight of that, in the everlasting fight to be right.</comment>

<comment>Hey look that "human being on the other side of the screen" is now left to name-calling. But hey keep telling me about "courtesy."</comment>

<comment>Sure, if you like: courtesy helps to change minds and hearts, and leaves others more inclined to listen, rather than shutting off communication as rudeness and scorn does.If you're one of those who derives weird pleasure from lobbing silly words at others, have fun - but it's a waste of time and serves no purpose.I do occasionally enjoy provoking bigoted people into slinging their limited repertoire of stereotypical hate-labels, because it reveals their low character.My opinion has been that you sound like an intelligent person, and I told you so.  But hey, keep trying to change my mind with your intransigence.In truth, I really don't care, but there's always a chance of meeting intelligent life online, and it's refreshing when it happens.  This exchange?  Increasingly tiresome.</comment>

<comment>I love how you try to lecture others about what homophobes "meant to say."  And then you try to lecture others about how you shouldn't call homophobes names but that it's okay for homophobes to call open-minded people names because that's not what they "meant to say."But then the second you're disproved, "I really don't really care."  But you seemed to care a lot when you were defending homophobes; why is that?</comment>

<comment>Nobody's left reading this anymore but you and I, and I'm logging off.</comment>

<comment>So, you really don't care but you still respond.  But you "mysteriously" have no answer to your defense of homophobes?</comment>

<comment>Okay, I was wrong - you are an idiot, and not the intelligent person I took you for at the start.  Congrats on the one thing you 'disproved' in this discussion, which had come to an end 2 months ago before you wasted my time and yours with this pathetic redux.  Tip: stick to current articles.  Bae!</comment>

<comment>Wow, that's a lot of writing for someone who "doesn't care" and is "logging off."  Man, I'd hate to see how much you'd yammer about stuff you do care about - like defending homophobes.</comment>

<comment>"That is what I meant..."  So you're now saying that you weren't using correct English before?So when you said the Ambassador was "holding office in a Christian organisation or church," you didn't ACTUALLY mean that the Ambassador was "holding office in a Christian organisation or church"?That's ironic, considering how you claim to be such a linguist...</comment>

<comment>What's ironic is that you still don't get why the Vatican is against the appointment. It's as plain as the nose on your face. I'm not even a Roman Catholic, and I get why they see through the provocation.</comment>

<comment>I never said anything like that.  Not once did I say I didn't understand why the Vatican was against his appointment.Do you have as much of a problem reading English as you do writing it?</comment>

<comment>You didn't have to say it specifically. You've demonstrated it here thoroughly and at length.</comment>

<comment>So, you're saying you don't have any facts...</comment>

<comment>I meant that he'll have an office in the Vatican. Twist it all you like, attempt the diversion of arguing over dictionary words—the French ambassador has an office in the Vatican. Here's the address, since you don't seem to believe that:http://www.embassypages.com/mi...</comment>

<comment>"attempt the diversion of arguing over dictionary words..."LOL - the "linguist" who demands that we define a word one way is demanding that we ignore the definitions of all the other words he uses and only use what he "meant."Also, that address is in ITALY. Here's a map - https://www.google.com/maps/pl...Also, notice the international phone number.  The international calling code is +39.  That's Italy.The international calling code for the Vatican is +379.</comment>

<comment>The Church is a government, though a spiritual one. It has officers, law, keys, and sanctions.</comment>

<comment>The church is a government.  But the church government has no foreign relations and receives no Ambassadors.Only the Holy See is a government of a state.  But hey keep stretching...</comment>

<comment>The French ambassador's office is in the Vatican, you know. You can deny it all you like, but it doesn't change the fact that this is true, and I've provided the link above for all to see.</comment>

<comment>Sure thing LIAR!!!</comment>

<comment>He does, but he ALSO represents the Vatican, which is why the Vatican appoints the ambassador.</comment>

<comment>LOL - The Ambassador from France to the Vatican doesn't represent the Vatican. In the REAL WORLD the definition of Ambasassador is: "a diplomatic official of the highest rank, sent by one sovereign or state to another as its resident representative."Ambassadors ONLY represent one country.The Vatican's representative to France is a man name Luigi Ventura.Ohh, wait, you don't believe in English definitions of words.  The Latin "ambactus" means "servant"; so you must believe that he's not a diplomatic offical but a servant.  Except "servant" comes from "servus" meaning "slave."  So you ACTUALLY think all Ambassadors are slaves, right?  According to your "linguistic" argument.Also France "appoints" which means, according to the English dictionary, "To select or designate to fill an office or a position."  Of course that comes from the French "apointer" which means "arrange to the point."  So they are just "arranging to a moint"However, the Vatican does not "appoint" the Ambassador; instead, the Vatican "accepts" the Ambassoador.  Now, according to the English dictionary: accept means: "to admit to a group, organization or place."  However, that comes from the Latin "adcapere" which means "to take"; so, according to your "linguistic" argument.So, while the rest of the world believes that Ambassadors represent one country to another, you of course don't.If we took your "lingusitic" argument and ignored the ENGLISH definitions of the word what is really happening is: "The government of France is arranging slaves to a point that the Vatican is taking."</comment>

<comment>Except that the Ambassador works as a liason to the Vatican. Clearly that's the problem, and you're conveniently ignoring it.</comment>

<comment>By Ambassador, I assume you mean the person you think is a "slave" based on the Latin definition and your "lingustic" logic.Except the Ambassador works in the French Embassy NOT the Vatican.I'm actually not ignoring anything.  I'm just pointing out that the French Ambassador (who you think is a "slave") doesn't work FOR the Church or FOR the Vatican.  He works FOR France.  You think he works FOR the Vatican (and you think he's a "slave").And the Vatican has the right to refuse to "accept" (which you think means "take") the Ambassador (who, once again, you think is a "slave").But he doesn't work FOR the Church or FOR the Vatican or for the most part IN the Vatican since the French Embassy TO the vatican is actually in Italy.</comment>

<comment>Don't you know the French Embassy is *in* Vatican City?</comment>

<comment>Actually the French Embassy isn't in the Vatican City.  The French Embassy to the Vatican is on Via Piave in Italy.  It's even on the other side of the Tiber from the Vatican City.  But hey keep lying!</comment>

<comment>Still fixated firmly on the minutiae instead of the elephant in the room. Fact is, the Vatican is a country. It's a small country, but the Vatican has the right of diplomatic refusal. But let's face it, France never intended to send whats-his-name to the Vatican; it was done to be provocative—for the press and to score SJW points.</comment>

<comment>I never said they didn't.  That was you inventing definitions again.</comment>

<comment>You are really stupid and you keep digging yourself deeper into your bigoted hole. Statement you made like "One does not send a Jew to be ambassador to a Muslim country unless one wishes to provoke, after all," show how ignorant you are. Did you realize that former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is Jewish? From your warped logic, the US offended the whole muslim world by her appointment. And you forget that Israel has a Jewish ambassador in Egypt, an Islamic country.And who made you the arbiter of "serious nomination" by the French? What do you know about France?</comment>

<comment>Tell us, do insults give you the sexual satisfaction you lack by other means?On the topic of stupid, you should know that cabinet secretaries aren't the same thing as ambassadors, although I do see the point you're trying to make (and it's fatally flawed, because 1) SecState is tenured in D.C., not Riyadh, Cairo or Tehran, and 2) Cabinet appointments are not subject to any other country's approval.)The only way to salvage your point would be to list all the Jews dispatched by the U.S. as ambassadors to Muslim countries - and most particularly those states in which Islam is the sole legal religion and Israel's very right to exist is denied.  Go ahead.It's pretty obvious that Israel sending Jews as ambassadors would be somewhat unavoidable, so that point of yours doesn't follow, either.Finally, France has comparatively few Jews, so why send one to a country where the religious difference might offend, given how many other French candidates are equally or better qualified?Is it really so odd to you that France would choose to force a political point on the Vatican by sending a gay man as ambassador?  One doesn't need to be French to figure this out, or to have a degree in French studies, or to have been to France (although I have).Now, try your sexual advances on other posters, won't you?  I'm not interested in anyone so keen on labeling others with hateful slurs like 'bigot.'  If anyone is bigoted here, it's you, another addict to ad hominem.</comment>

<comment>SEX, sex, sex....... your obsession! For the record, I called you stupid because non of your comments makes any sense. You brought up sex, why? You fake christians are obsessed about gay sex just like Ted Haggard, and we know how he ended up. You've proven beyond doubt that you're an imbecile and a bigot. I bet that no gay man would want to have sex with you, so as Dick Cheney says, "Go F*ck yourself."</comment>

<comment>U mad, bro?  Good.  Learn something before judging. Insults say more about the sender than the receiver.</comment>

<comment>how do you know that?  the man could be very qualified to hold the position.</comment>

<comment>He's a representative of his own country as well as the Vatican. Don't twist it or I'll get the Pope in here to settle it.</comment>

<comment>An ambassador is a diplomatic go-between and there are two countries in the relationship. One is France and the other is the Vatican. If it were a post with no connection to the Vatican, this would not be a problem.</comment>

<comment>Actually, he is NOT a go-between.  An ambassador represents one government TO another." If it were a post with no connection to the Vatican, this would not be a problem."  I never said that the post had no connection.</comment>

<comment>This is simply nit-picking and inconsequential. Representing one government TO another (is your caps lock key broken?) and "go-between" aren't differences of kind, but degree.</comment>

<comment>LOLLet all bask in the glorious unintended irony!You are going through semantic somersaults and using definistions from different languages to make sure that your definition, rather than the dictionary one, of "homophobia."However, when somebody else questions your definition of the job of Ambassador, they're being "nit-picking and inconsequential."LOL</comment>

<comment>You've really got nothing, do you? No understanding of language or politics. I'll say it again: "homophobia" means "fear of homosexuals." Accusing Christians of being afraid of homosexuals, as if they were recoiling from a scary spider, is absolutely absurd and laughable.You are a laughable, crapulous mass.</comment>

<comment>LOL - Once again, that's not what homophobia means. The English dictionary challenges your definition.But, hey keep resorting to 18th century name-calling instead. It makes you sound "smart."</comment>

<comment>Nope, sorry—that's laughable from a linguistic standpoint. The root word is Greek and what I said it means above is actually what it means in English as well.</comment>

<comment>LOL - "lingustic standpoint"Meanwhile in REAL LINGUISTICS,  there is a concept known as "Semantic Shift" that was introduced as early as the 19th Century.Semantic shift shows that over time or when transfering between languages the meanings of words change.An common example of this semantic shift in English is the word: "mad."  In British English it ONLY means "crazy." Yet, in the US we use it mostly to mean "angry."  Notice in the US there has been a "semantic shift."An example between countries is the word "schmooze." In Yiddish this word meant merely: "to talk or chat."   Meanwhile in English the word encountered a "semantic shift" to mean "talk intimately as if to influence."So "from a semantic standpoint," the word homophobia has gone through a "semantic shift" from it's Greek origin to its current ACTUAL meaning - which can be found in any English dictionary.LOL - "linguistic standpoint" - LOL.</comment>

<comment>ROFLOL. Except in this case there wasn't any semantic shift. Your expertise at linguistics seems to be quite limited, and your examples don't apply here. You didn't notice where I said that -phobia means fear in Greek, did you? I studied Greek, you know.</comment>

<comment>LOL - Except we're talking about an ENGLISH word.The New American Heritage Dictionary defines "homophobia" as: "dislike of or prejudice against homosexual people."Your ability to read dictionaries seems to be quite limited, and your study of Greek doesn't apply hear.  You didn't notice where I said what the English dictionary said the definition was, did you?  I read an English dictionary, you know.Please tell me more about how The French Ambassodor TO the Vatican represents the Vatican in any capacity?</comment>

<comment>Your quoting of the NAHD just proves my point. You can bandy semantics all the day long, but the fact remains that suggesting that Christians who don't think homosexuals should hold office in posts related to the Church are afraid of them is laughable, laughable! Yes, that's right, we ridicule people like you who cannot tell the difference between ontology and phobia.I've got news for you—nobody in the churches that refuse to ordain homosexuals is afraid of gays. It's done on the basis of theology, not social approbation. I've pointed out again and again that the reason for this is based on ontology, not fear, but you're obsessed with the French Ambassador. Deny it all you like, but the reason the Vatican has expressed displeasure is because the office of the French Ambassador is located in the Vatican! If the post were restricted solely to functions related to the French Embassy, nobody would be uttering a peep against it. </comment>

<comment>By "bandy semantics" do you mean use word correctly?"Suggesting that Christians who don't think homosexuals should hold office in posts related to the Church are afraid of them is laughable, laughable!" I never said that, largely because I was using the word correcly.  If you thought I was "suggesting" anything, you're wrong.  You see, I was actually saying what I was saying."I've got news for you—nobody in the churches that refuse to ordain homosexuals is afraid of gays. It's done on the basis of theology, not social approbation" - I never said that was."The Vatican has expressed displeasure is because the post is related to the Vatican! "  I never said it wasn't.  You were the one claiming the French Ambassador TO the Vatican worked FOR the Vatican.But you certainly destroyed those straw man arguments if had made them, right?</comment>

<comment>I'll just quote another commenter who also sees through your ruse:"He could certainly be the ambassador - but not without equally deliberate credentialing by the Vatican hierarchy, and they didn't want France's gay candidate presumably because of the dissonance of Church teaching vs the tacit acceptance implied in accepting a gay ambassador."The point, I repeat again, is that the Vatican has good reasons for not credentialing a homosexual. You might not like it, but no amount of SJW shilling is going to change the fact that they don't do so out of fear, but because of theological issues related to church teaching.</comment>

<comment>What ruse?But, nice job beating the crap out of arguments I never made!</comment>

<comment>Actually, 'homophobia' would mean 'fear of something the same' in Greek.</comment>

<comment>And don't discount rank fear of offspring being or "turning" gay.</comment>

<comment>Wow. What a profoundly uninformed comment. I think Jesse put you in your place rather succinctly.</comment>

<comment>Wait, are you seriously saying that "homophobia" does *not* mean fear of homosexuals? Hmmm. My dictionary says that's precisely what "-phobia" means. I think I'll go with that over your explanation. Thanks for playing.</comment>

<comment>It’s about the irrelevance of the Bible and about people acting on religious delusion in a manner that harms others.</comment>

<comment>It's about the irrelevance of atheists and about people acting on religious delusion in a manner that harms others.See what I did there? </comment>

<comment>The French ambassador to the Vatican isn't exactly an office holder in the RC church, is he?</comment>

<comment>He's a liason between the French government and the Vatican, and this was a move made by France to provoke—it was a PR stunt. And yes, the Vatican does have a say in who qualifies to act in such a capacity.</comment>

<comment>He's not an office holder in the Roman Catholic Church.</comment>

<comment>Nobody said he was "an office holder in the Roman Catholic Church." I know he's not. He's an ambassador between France and the Vatican. The office of the French Ambassador is at the Vatican, and the Vatican exercises a right of refusal. That is the problem.</comment>

<comment>He's an ambassador from the French to the Vatican. He's not supposed to be some impartial go between, he represents the French State and presents their views and issues to the Vatican.</comment>

<comment>His office is in Vatican City, and you're wrong about what the ambassador's role is. It is most definitely that of a mediator.</comment>

<comment>That's not even a good linguistic point.  Phobia can simply mean aversion rather than fear.  For instance, no one thinks that hydrophobic liquids (lipids, etc.) "fear" water.</comment>

<comment>That is much too nuanced, let alone informed, an opinion to be tolerated here.</comment>

<comment>"Homophobia" also means fear of appearing homosexual and fear of homosexuality within oneself. This manifests in restrictive affection between men, restricted emotionality, and avoidance of associating with homosexual people. Much of homophobia is men not allowing themselves to acknowledge the same sex attraction that naturally occurs in people, and reaction to such homophobia may be relatively benign (suppressing/repressing emotions) or dangerous (killing gay people).</comment>

<comment>I am very bigoted against Christian bigots such as what you appear to be. Is your pure Christian soul destined for a higher seat in Heaven, due to your fear and hate of others with a different sexual-orientation?</comment>

<comment>Meh, it's still not that much.  $600,000 is paltry in the advertising world and there are probably 100 churches in my county alone.</comment>

<comment>You are making my point.  $600,000 and 80 evangelical churches?  There are tens of thousands of Christian churches in the U.S.  80 of them contributed one person's 401k balance toward an ad campaign in 1998.  It's a ridiculously small amount of churches and money.  It is completely unrepresentative of Christianity.Sheesh!  Our church spent $40,000 dollars on new sidewalks and parking lot.  $600,000 is a joke.  </comment>

<comment>it was common in the Christian Church and the farther back you go the more mainstream Christianity preached hate towards gays</comment>

<comment>Conversion therapy was NEVER common.And stating that homosexual relations are a sin isn't  hateful.  Nor is it hateful to say that premarital hook ups are a sin. </comment>

<comment>Conversion therapy was not common because most could not afford it, but there is still widespread belief that it is appropriate which is, of course, based on misinformation and religious delusion.</comment>

<comment>"there is still widespread belief that it is appropriate"cite?</comment>

<comment>I didn't meant to imply "educated or qualified belief."Take a look at the lay people in the Bible belt and read the comment sections on the issue.</comment>

<comment>I grew up in the Bible belt and still have lots of family there.I'm wondering where you get that there is still widespread belief that it is appropriate.  Per this article, there's been a real change here.</comment>

<comment>Is it your personal belief that same gender couples should not be allowed to marry and that they should remain out of sight, and that they chose their sexual orientation? </comment>

<comment>No.  Why would you think it is?</comment>

<comment>Just checking.</comment>

<comment>Checking... so he could label you a bigot, if you failed his sociopolitical litmus test.</comment>

<comment>Widespread?A fraction of a fraction of a percent of churches participated in the $600,000 national advertising campaign to promote conversion therapy.Conversion therapy in Christianity is about as wide spread as Lamborghinis in the long term parking lot at the airport.  </comment>

<comment>I suppose that people today are politically allergic to the idea of sin.  I don't place much weight on it, myself.Calling some behavior a 'sin' is construed on the left to mean you disapprove of it, and if you openly disapprove, then certain identity groups will disapprove of your disapproval and attempt to punish you for daring to express it.What's being passed off as 'hate' these days is, in most cases, a simple case of expressing a nonconforming opinion in a public space.I don't place any more value on the trendy idea of 'hate' than I do on the antiquated idea of 'sin.'  Just cultural labels abused by the powerful to suppress threatening ideas.</comment>

<comment>It may not be hateful in your mind, but it is in rational minds. At the very least, it's passing judgement on another, something you nor anyone has a right to do in regards to another's personal life. You don't Jesus us, we won't as*hole you, deal?</comment>

<comment>No thanks.  I'll pass on your "deal"I prefer the current system where i have the right to my religion and to express my views and you have the right to lack of religion and your views (and misunderstanding about passing judgement).  </comment>

<comment>You certainly have the right to your religious views, but you do not have the right to force others to share them. Sin is your problem, not ours.</comment>

<comment>We don't force others to share them. We're not the ones demanding that cake bakers and florists conform to our theology.</comment>

<comment>Lol. You're the ones refusing to serve customers. At the business you opened to the 'public'. So in effect, you actually are demanding they share your views. </comment>

<comment>Memories Pizza didn't refuse to serve anybody. I suggest you inform yourself before commenting.</comment>

<comment>Did I mention the pizza place? Nope. Inform this bigot, just because you don't like how somebody lives their personal life, it doesn't mean you get to break the law under the pretense of religious freedom. Did you note how fast that governor had the lawmakers fix that crap legislation? Shoo</comment>

<comment>"Inform this bigot?" Are you talking to yourself now? I can't say I'm surprised. News flash: you don't get to terrorize law-abiding people and destroy their business because they have the liberty not to bake you a cake or arrange your flowers. Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Hmm. I'm talking to you, yes. However, I wasn't the one who brought up the business. Regardless, apparently 'we' do get to run them out of business, cause that's what happened. Ironic, considering all she had to do was not tell the news she wouldn't cater a gay wedding. But again, I wasn't the one talking about the pizza place. And yes, you're a bigot.</comment>

<comment>ROFLOL. Hilarious. I'm a bigot, but you're on the side of those who want to burn down a family business because they won't be forced to conform to your beliefs. Fascinating, but a total fail.</comment>

<comment>I'm not 'on their side', I'm saying their tactics worked. I give no damns if they conform to my beliefs, or what they believe, as long as they aren't hurting others, or making us conform to their beliefs. You don't christian me, I won't atheist you. This is a secular country. Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>boycotting a business and promoting that boycott on social media isn't considered terrorism by most people.</comment>

<comment>You have great difficulty reading, don't you? I already explained to you that Memories Pizza refused no customers, gay or otherwise. Why is this so difficult for you to understand? Are you that brainwashed by the status quo? http://reason.com/blog/2015/04...</comment>

<comment>"the farther back you go the more mainstream Christianity preached hate towards gays"The farther back you go the more lots of groups espoused what we now determine to be bad ideas about some other group.I deny that "hate" was ever preached outside fringe groups like Westboro.If you turn your statement around what is happening the farther forward you go?You can't change the past, Jason.  There's no way to do it. If mainstream Christians today wanted to change the past, they couldn't.  I'm not sure it's fair to beat on people for what happened in the past, that they didn't personally participate in and that they deplore and wouldn't repeat if they could.</comment>

<comment>Good lord, listen to Huckabee and Cruz and James Dobson, right now, on their views of gay people and gayness itself. Check out Dobson's views going back to at least the 90s, where I remember him talking about this on the radio. (I am not as certain about earlier, but ISTR this a topic on Christian radio back in the 80s as well.)This was widespread in radioland Christianity.The weirdest thing about it is that during all this time I was attending evangelical churches, and never heard this nonsense from the pulpit. Never read this in the creeds and doctrines. Theology was mostly silent on this.This was just crazy talk on the airwaves and in the popular discussions among evangelicals, how "we" could fix "those" people. Conferences, books, foundations, tapes, TV shows, radio shows -- all based on a ginormous falsehood.</comment>

<comment>But according to some in this thread, it never happened and no Christians were involved.</comment>

<comment>I've been a Christian 40+ years. I've seen a lot of things and have heard a lot of things.Christians do stupid, mean, silly, hateful, cruel things all the time. Being a Christian, being named a "Christian" offers absolutely no guarantee of being and acting any better. I'm not saying this as some defense, of "well, we're forgiven, not perfect." I'm saying it as simply what is the truth: we are often terrible in what we do, and we often pretend it's "godly" to be terrible.When my co-religionists are craven, are despicable, are cowards, are bullies, are selfish or short-sighted or just plain ugly in their manners, I will call them out. They are shaming the faith I share with them, and they are doing it in such as way as to demonstrate their blindness and lack of humility.No one, believer or no, is exempt from the very common experience of being human. Humans are stupid, mean, silly, hateful, cruel - you can make a list, and will likely match mine.Being a Christian, IMO, does mean that you're forgiven, but it's absolutely no excuse for rotten behavior. You want to say you follow Jesus, then you'd better be following him, and not just with your lips: you'd better show by your behavior that you follow him.When I hear ignorant and hateful things being said by Christians in the name of Christ, I'm revulsed. Christ dined with sinners, with prostitutes, with tax-collectors. His condemnation was reserved for people who were ostensibly religious and yet outrageously hateful, spiteful, selfish, and entirely convinced that their religiosity was all that God required.These men (it's almost always men) who speak out like this have some weird hang-up about what people do in their private lives in intimacy with their partners. I get it that these men have their hang-ups. I don't get that they have somehow connected their sexual hang-ups with their faith. The two are not connected.If Mike Huckabee and James Dobson don't want to have a same-sex marriage in their own lives, then have at it: don't have a same-sex partner. If they think that the people in their own faith group also should not have same-sex marriages, then have at it - in their faith group.But it's just flat-out wrong to take any religious doctrine and attempt to make it public policy.Flat. Out. Wrong.It's like we have to keep explaining to religionists: you cannot make someone into a believer or follower. You cannot make them obedient.You'd think that the example of Jesus in the New Testament where he simply talked to people would be enough of an example. I can't think of any laws Jesus passed or any governments he forced to be "Christian."Christians who claim to be persecuted for their "Christian" beliefs (in America, at least) are far more likely to be persecuted because they are boors and fear-mongers who are deliberately cruel to people they despise.</comment>

<comment>That's absolutely ridiculous. Conversion therapy has never been advocated by more than a tiny sliver of the Christian Church. Maybe not even a sliver—a drop in the bucket.</comment>

<comment>Actually, conversion therapy was an 'advancement' in how Christians seemed to 'deal with' gay people.  Instead of treating them as 'devils to be purged', they had become 'lost souls to fix'.In fact the obvious failure of it has lead us to where we are today.</comment>

<comment>Some Christians.  My years and years and years of church attending in the Bible belt didn't yield any teaching on homosexuality except as it appeared in scripture that was being read.  I think some of our commenters imagine that all preachers in pulpits across America harangued congregations about it weekly.</comment>

<comment>80 ministries across 34 states is a far cry from "Some far flung evangelical gay conversion church in Texas". Have you seen these ministries? They're huge, and many have radio and TV shows.I'm not gay, don't have gay friends, know nothing about the gay community, but heard about these gay conversion camps just from living in Florida. They were a big industry, and very often a tax-free cash cow for the people who ran them.</comment>

<comment>We don't ban any kind of talk therapies in America.There are hundreds of them.No banning allowed.</comment>

<comment>Thank you Jonathan for an insightful and well-researched article.  I spent my teens and 20's desperately involved in "conversion therapy." I was a true believer.  At 31, I had a girlfriend...but there I was, taking the elevator to the top of the Empire State Building and thinking the unthinkable. I just didn't see a way out. My truth was abominable to the Church and shameful to my family should they ever find out... While it's often called "reparative therapy," it almost destroyed me.  Bryan Christopher (Author, Hiding from Myself)</comment>

<comment>It's a very harmful therapy and is being rightly denounced. I hope you have now found a community of people who support you, and  that your family has come around.</comment>

<comment>That's why conservative Christians have turned away from supporting something they desperately wanted to work:1 - It didn't work.2 - It hurt people.I'm glad it didn't destroy you.</comment>

<comment>If only they would apply that experience to other issues.</comment>

<comment>How's that drug war coming along?</comment>

<comment>Ask conservative Christians. They fully support it.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>When can we expect Michelle Bachmann's husband to emerge from the closet?</comment>

<comment>He will never admit it even though the whole world can see he was born that way</comment>

<comment>OK, throw a few rocks at him while you're at it.</comment>

<comment>You are aware that he practices "gay conversion therapy"?</comment>

<comment>So you want to speculate about his personal business - that's helping anyone how?</comment>

<comment>Speculate? It was on Nightline!https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>That he's gay and closeted?  Nightline reported that?</comment>

<comment>The conversion therapy part, which is what seamus made clear he was talking about, that you then called "speculation".This line of evasion is really beneath you.</comment>

<comment>No, it's the in the closet stuff that I am calling speculation.  I dislike shaming people because they're gay and I dislike speculation that people are gay that's made in order to shame them.  I wouldn't have thought I would be alone in that.  Dislike the conversion part all day long - I am right there with you.  Looks to me like you could make your point without gay panic.</comment>

<comment>Not anymore.</comment>

<comment>...And furthermore, your statement could read that you are trying to shame him by asserting that he is gay.  Do you really want to go down that road?</comment>

<comment>See - you read that as shaming him by asserting that he's gay. I read that as deriding him for being a hypocrite, which is actually worthy of scorn. Being gay is not.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure he's a hypocrite. I wonder if he's not sharing the therapy that "saved him from his sin."The man is clearly living a lie and my heart goes out to him for that. And of course, to anyone who's made to feel this barbaric therapy is necessary.</comment>

<comment>What if he's not gay?</comment>

<comment>Then it would be wrong to deride him as a hypocrite. My point still stands though: pointing out the guy's involvement in gay conversion therapy doesn't mean he's being criticized for being gay.</comment>

<comment>Bringing up a specific person and asking when he's going to come out of the closet - you don't see how that could be construed as sneering at him for probably being gay?</comment>

<comment>Not necessarily. Maybe I read the sneer differently because I don't see that being gay is anything to sneer at, but being hypocritical about it is.A gay person who is out of the closet is honest about who he is. A gay person in the closet is not ready for that level of honesty, which is fine - people make personal choices based on whatever factors are relevant to themselves.A gay person who is in the closet AND telling other gays that they should be paying him to change their sinful sexuality is a whole other ball game, which is what I got from the fact that 'seamus2" specifically brought up Bachmann's involvement with gay conversion therapy. And I agree that this is different from him just being gay - or even just being in the closet.</comment>

<comment>Please remember that it's not only gay people reading this stuff.  You have your perspective.  How would a person who teeters on the verge of homophobia anyway read this?</comment>

<comment>Your comment doesn't make much sense to me - sorry.</comment>

<comment>you think calling him gay is some kind of insult.</comment>

<comment>If it wasn't, then how does "when's he coming out of the closet" strike any points?</comment>

<comment>no it's not an insult.  it's striking points because he's a hypocrite.and he's definitely gay as far as I'm concerned.  anyone with a modicum of intelligence can see that.</comment>

<comment>As far as you're concerned?  How far are you concerned?  Is looking at people you don't know on TV and deciding "he's gay" really, really where you want to go?Also, suppose that he is same-sex oriented.  Explain how you get from there to hypocrisy, unless you personally have had sex with him or know someone who has.</comment>

<comment>As a gay man, that's exactly where I'm going. Glad you could notice.Now if you want to defend a self hating, hypocritical homo, then by all means do so; that's your right.  I on the other hand will not and will continue to call him for what he is.</comment>

<comment>The self-hating part appears to describe you, if it's an insult to speculate that someone is gay.Still don't know where you get "hypocrite" unless you know of him engaging in same-sex activity.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm definitely not a self hating homo.  That clearly resides in Michelle's husband and his actions prove that. I have a strong feeling you don't understand homosexuality and I don't see why you feel the need to insult me.  I don't think I've insulted you.I never said it was an insult to speculate he's gay.  There's nothing insulting about being gay.  But it's pretty insulting to be a hypocrite, which is exactly what he is.</comment>

<comment>How is he a hypocrite?  You have not spelled that out.  If he is attracted to men but has never acted on it, how is that hypocritical?And if you want to say "he looks gay to me" (I can't believe you want to go there, really) and that it's hypocritical for him to be married to a woman (illogical though that is; do you get to pronounce on how people who are strangers to you have to live their lives?) you should be able to do it without using the SAME slur that straight folks have sneered at probably gay folks with.  When's he coming out, indeed.</comment>

<comment>it's hypocritical because he supports conversion therapy. he's hypocritical because he supports laws that keep glbt community as second class citizens when everyone with a modicum of intelligence can see that he's gay himself.   him acting out on his desires is irrelevant.what slur?  that i'm calling him out?  that's not a slur.  there's nothing wrong with being gay.  it's only a slur to homophobic people and people who aren't comfortable with their sexuality.</comment>

<comment>So he supports conversion therapy.  You can *look* at him and see that he's having sex with men, is that it?  Because he is married to a woman and I am hard-pressed to see any hypocrisy there, otherwise.If you are saying "when's he coming out of the closet" that is calling him out for being gay.  You can keep saying it's not, but if it were a straight homophobe saying it about you, you'd see it clearly for what it is.  There's got to be a way to say "he supports conversion therapy but I somehow magically know he's having sex with men" without that.ETA:  " him acting out on his desires is irrelevant."  How?  How in the complete bloody hell do you KNOW what his desires are?  Are you a mind reader?</comment>

<comment>he doesn't have to be having sex with men to be gay.  he doesn't have to be acting out on his desires.  you can't see the hypocrisy because you don't think he's gay.  for you, he has to publicly state it to the world before you would believe it.  hahahahaha; that's so cute.  deulsional, but cute.it's not a slur and you simply cannot understand,  i don't care what a straight man says about me. i'm comfortable in who i am as a person.  if marcus considers it a slur to be called gay, then that's a pretty clear sign in his lack of self confidence regarding his sexuality.   if i assumed a straight man was gay and i confronted him about it, and if he was completely self confident in who he was, then he wouldn't find my assumption to be insulting or a slur if he wasn't gay because it's not.in the end, i really don't care what you think.  you can defend the miserable, self hating, homo, all you want. (calling him a homo is not derogatory so don't starting whining about that)  it doesn't change the fact that he's most certainly gay and he supports laws that keep people back  because of their sexuality and he supports therapies that are very harmful to other gay and lesbian people.</comment>

<comment>I don't care if he's gay or not.If he says "I don't have sex with men" or "with my conversion therapy men don't have to have sex with men" or "with my conversion therapy men don't have same-sex attractions" and you know he has sex with men or has same-sex attractions then he is a liar.  If you don't know these things then you can't know if he is a liar.  Do you know these thing or do you just "know" them b/c you can ... what, tell by looking?" if i assumed a straight man was gay and i confronted him about it,"  Why would you confront him about it if it's not a slur?Why is it not enough to say "conversion therapy is not only ineffective but is downright harmful and it needs to stop"?  Why do you have to go further and decide someone you don't know feels this or that or does this or that?  How is that value-added?</comment>

<comment>"Do you know these thing or do you just "know" them b/c you can ... what, tell by looking?"--   do you watch late night tv? commedians? talk show hosts? do you know any gay men or  women?  have you ever seen him talk? his mannerisms? the way he acts in public?  have you ever heard of the term "gaydar" and it's effectiveness in judging people.  you may have heard of it, but not necessarily know how it works.  that's understandable, most straight people don't.  anyway,  i'm confident in knowing he's gay.  you disagree, that's fine. that's your opinion and you have every right to believe that.  (the above questions are sort of rhetorical so no need to really answer at this point.)"" if i assumed a straight man was gay and i confronted him about it," Why would you confront him about it if it's not a slur?"   fine, confront was probably the wrong word for you.  you can use "meet", "introduce", and a host of others; my point stands.  if you're comfortable in your sexuality then it wouldn't bother you if someone made a mistake in assuming your straight or gay because being either of the two isn't a slur nor an insult.so you see no value in my comments about marcus and his hyprocrisy towards the glbt community; you don't agree.ok, great.  let's move on then.</comment>

<comment>Kinda. He & his wife have no problem 'shaming' anyone else, why do they get a pass? FWIW, most people, myself included, have no problem with the man being gay. Our problem with the Bachman's is the hypocrisy.</comment>

<comment>"Kinda. He & his wife have no problem 'shaming' anyone else, why do they get a pass?"Once again - do we peg our standards to other people's bad behavior. or to other people's good behavior, or do we figure out what standards we want to have for ourselves?  Do we race to the lowest common denominator?  Do we ask ourselves, "if everyone acted as I do, what would the world be like?"</comment>

<comment>Hell of a lot better. You're asking us citizens to give these public figures a pass. We don't get to make policy, they do. </comment>

<comment>1 - What public policy is Mr. Bachmann making?2 - I'm not asking us to give anybody a pass.  I'm asking us to behave like decent people.  How can you expect someone else to meet a standard you yourself do not feel constrained to meet?</comment>

<comment>Mrs. Bachman was making policy, & she publicly stated many times she does what her husband tells her to do. Not to mention all the federal money get to run their 'therapy' programs. I find them hypocritical, & I see no reason they shouldn't be called out on it.</comment>

<comment>Where exactly do you see hypocrisy?  And can you find a way to call it out that does not appear to shame a man for being gay?</comment>

<comment>In all the ways? She's a pretty fierce anti-tax nutter, as well as being openly hostile to poor folks receiving benefits. Meanwhile, they get tax dollars out the yang to fund their anti-gay, anti-poor agenda. All that's true whether Mr Bachman is gay or not.</comment>

<comment>Then you can say those things without the snide "when's he coming out of the closet".</comment>

<comment>I wasn't the one who said that...</comment>

<comment>You're questioning why I responded to Seamus the way I did.  Hence my answer.</comment>

<comment>Did you read the article? Most of the people who were engaged in conversion therapy not only admitted that it didn't work but also acknowledged their own continued gay identity, The expression "in the closet" tends to refer to someone who either for reasons of personal denial, social pressure,or external shaming have not publicly acknowledged their true sexuality. This guy appears to fit the bill.I think you're so busy trying to score points as an ally that you've chosen to deliberately misread what people are writing.</comment>

<comment>I'm not trying to score points."I wonder if he's gay/when he's going to come out" have traditionally been gay-shaming statements among straight folks.  It is startling to see these from people who claim to be gay or to support gay rights.If you have a problem with conversion therapy you can say so.  What's the point in speculating about someone's orientation?  What are you really accomplishing when you do that?</comment>

<comment>I happen to agree with the strategy of outing people who are gay and hiding it while advocating discrimination and hatred towards gay people. It's not universally popular but if it makes the haters a little more anxious about spreading fear and hatred then I'm willing to sacrifice their discomfort.</comment>

<comment>It also reveals a lot about your character.</comment>
