<comment>Can we just admit that populist conservatism is a knee-jerk form of inverse identity politics rather than a coherent theory of governance already?</comment>

<comment>White supremacy is really all Trump's supporters have after a certain point.</comment>

<comment>All their complaints sound the same to me now. "Obama hates white people" means white people only run 90 percent of everything now. "War on Suburbia" means suburbs are no longer the unquestioned, celebrated and subsidized lifestyle choice. "Militant secularism" means you don't get an automatic pat on the back for praising Jesus, and "radical feminism" means you have to listen to women's opinions once in a while. And so on and so forth.Basically, they want to keep getting cookies and participation trophies for being or choosing those things and they're threatened by a world where they're not publicly and consistently affirmed for being the in-group. You nailed it when you called it a "safe space."</comment>

<comment>You liberals are the enemy of conservatives, but you will be replaced by Islamists that have 8 kids per family. Jefferson could tell a whig from a tory by looking at them, but in another 200 years there will be none you to look at.</comment>

<comment>Liberals are not the enemies of conservatives.  Conservatives are afraid of liberals and hence think that liberals are their enemies.</comment>

<comment>Liberals try to steal my money, land rights, freedom of speech, gun rights, and expose me to inner city welfare monsters. If that is not an enemy, I would like to know the threshold.</comment>

<comment>Ah, you're a taxes = slavery type of moron, this should be fun.</comment>

<comment>100% taxes is not slavery, it is serfdom. Slaves are treated better than serfs. Note Stalin's canal project.</comment>

<comment>The maximum effective rate is 30% I believe. You're paying nothing compared to other OECD nations.</comment>

<comment>I am one of those poor schleppers with few hundred k a year coming in and no tax dodges and no tax attourney.</comment>

<comment>"I am one of those poor schleppers [sic]with few hundred k a year coming in and no tax dodges and no tax attourney [sic]."Why not just say, "I'm an idiot."  Conveys the same point, but removes any doubt as to whether you're just lying.</comment>

<comment>First World Problems! Must be super tough being richer than 99% of the Earth's population.</comment>

<comment>A few hundred k and no tax attorney? Either you lie, or you're an idiot. Make your choice.</comment>

<comment>That's an inclusive use of 'or.'</comment>

<comment>Is likely both </comment>

<comment>I vote that he's a lying idiot.</comment>

<comment>Does a few (At least 3, right?) hundred K coming in yearly make one a poor schlepper in any community in the US?  The Hamptons?  Manhattan?  San Fran?  Single, no dependants and all income from salary/wages means you pay 80K in taxes a year, leaving your single no dependant a$$ with 220K to do as you please.  poor schlepper indeed.  Or you're a liar.</comment>

<comment>Reminds me of driving past one of the fanciest houses in town, and the owner has a sign out front that says he's a prisoner of liberal economics. Poor guy, having to lug that cross everywhere.</comment>

<comment>Yes it does. </comment>

<comment>Where?  Let me know where I should send my next charity check to so I can ensure that some poor single guy with a take home of $220K doesn't go without food.</comment>

<comment>Since when do liberals give to charity?No one is asking for charity, just noting that rich and poor is relative. Just like a poor person in the US would not seem poor to someone living in a garbage dump outside of Mexico City. </comment>

<comment>Liberals give to charities, just usually not churches.  That is the main driver of "conservatives give more"  meme.  You don't need to explain anything about wealth being a relative standard, but again, if you have an income of 300K in this (or any country), you are not food insecure, housing insecure, your kids will be able to go to college and are not a "poor Schlepper"  No, the whole world is not your oyster, but no one anywhere should be throwing you a pity party because your Beemer broke down and you have to drive the caddy this week.</comment>

<comment>uh...you don't need to give to churches, go give to Planned Parenthood so we don't have to.A household in my town with a couple of kids is not going hungry but they are also not going out to dinner.</comment>

<comment>Awww... I have taken advantage of the infrastructure, technological and educational advancements gained through other peoples taxes to make more money than the vast majority of people in the world and now I'm being taxed!</comment>

<comment>You have cause and effect reversed. Prosperity leads to good stuff not vice versa</comment>

<comment>Ah, to be making a few hundred K a year. Still waiting on my first, and I get up everyday and go to work and pay a big old chunk of taxes and hope I can stretch to my next payday. You might want to get to know your neighbors.</comment>

<comment>Maybe because you can't spell...</comment>

<comment>100% taxes? Go back to watching sports. Your hyperbole soaked mentality is nothing more than a new incarnation of Chicken Little.</comment>

<comment>You are pretty sad.</comment>

<comment>Paranoid much?  Boo!</comment>

<comment>"Inner city welfare monsters."  You are a sterling example of why ignorance is often worse than stupidity.  There's no need for you to be ignorant, but you're going to stay that way, and probably proud of it.Don't get me wrong, though, I'm not saying you're not stupid, too.  Just that it's the less egregious offense.</comment>

<comment>racist, paranoid. Where's your tin hat?</comment>

<comment>It's ALL about YOU, isn't it? That's the real fear here... that YOUR country is being invaded by US... the rest of America. And when I say US, I mean those OTHER Americas who pay their taxes, too.</comment>

<comment>You forgot your tin foil.  Most of all, they want your tin foil.  Hat-less, you are quite vulnerable.That's the threshold.  When Obama comes after your tin foil, look out...they mean business at that point.</comment>

<comment>You are RIGHT!  In fact, just tonight we had a meeting to discuss how we are going to take your guns away, burn a cross on your front yard, and expose you to Black People!Without your tin foil, you will be powerless to stop us.  And your Trump will not help you.  He is too busy chatting up boys wearing panties.Be very afraid.</comment>

<comment>Liberals are a temporary problem. Islamists have 8 kids per family and want to behead you for being an infidel. Obama's favorite immigration group is Islamists.</comment>

<comment>Islamists have 8 kids per family. They are Obama's chosen immigrants. They want to behead infidels. There you will be without a gun.</comment>

<comment>They promise to let me help with the children.</comment>

<comment>There is no threshold because to them, the end justifies the means</comment>

<comment>:::raising hand:::  I am!I'm a former liberal, and you betcha I'm afraid of liberals.Liberals today are not the liberals of before.  There were real liberals before.  Those who call themselves liberals today are some seriously disturbed individuals who pretend to stand for the same beliefs, but behave in complete contradiction to them.</comment>

<comment>Poor little hen</comment>

<comment>Put your hand down. You don't even know me and you certainly didn't describe me.</comment>

<comment>If you're protesting this much, it means I've described you.  Otherwise, I welcome you to prove me wrong (but you won't because what on earth could you possibly use to defend what I said).</comment>

<comment>"Liberal" is the wrong word.  "Leftist".  In most of the world "Liberal" means "Free market" conservative.</comment>

<comment>rogelio, it does?  I use liberal and leftist interchangeably because that's how it's used here in the U.S.  I never understood "liberal" to mean conservative when I was in Spain.  Weird.</comment>

<comment>The term "Liberal" is used to define someone who believes in free market/laissez faire economics, except in the US where it is confused with the contradictory term "Leftist".  Normally "Liberals" are in disagreement with "Leftists" on economic matters since "Leftists" tend to believe in socialist economic policies which are in contradiction to "Liberalism" or "Laissez faire" economics.  Hopefully that makes sense...?I agree with you that in the US these two terms are used interchangeably, but that is a misuse of the terms.</comment>

<comment>In the US, the usage for that is Libertarian - someone who is a right winger fiscally, but who likes "sex, drugs, and rock n' roll," so to speak.  Leftist, liberal, etc. is for a someone who is a socialist fiscally, and likes "sex, drugs and rock n' roll."I'm not totally a fiscal right winger, but I am a right winger when it comes to Muslims, defense, guns, affirmative action, immigration, hb-1 visas (these need a moratorium for a few decades), financing for those who want body dysmorphic changes, and the right of businesses to hire whom they feel like without being forced to hire specific people (sheet-covered females, etc.)</comment>

<comment>"Liberals are not the enemies of conservatives."___Indeed. The opposite of liberal is illiberal, and the opposite of conservative is radical. That being the case, there are a LOT of liberal conservatives in the world. (There are also a lot of illiberal radicals).If Edmund Burke himself lived in a liberal society (and, indeed, he did, by the standards of his day) then he would wish to conserve that liberalism.</comment>

<comment>Liberals are guys/women with Big Egos who always talk about what's good for "US" when they mean themselves. It's US when they need taxes or approval of anal/oral sex as love & marriage.Its ME when they utter their own wishes as The Truth--which We must all accept as ex cathedra.</comment>

<comment>Hmm, makes one wonder what is your main topic of political discourse is</comment>

<comment>I DO --I RENDER ONTO CESAR WHAT IS HIS AND ONTO CHRIST WHAT IS HIS AS HE SAID TO---THERE IS NOTHING THAT JESUS SAID THAT ALLOWS FOR ANY TO TAKE BY FORCE FROM OTHERS TO GIVE TO ANYONE!

<comment>Please elaborate. I have lots of popcorn.</comment>

<comment>A problem with this statement is that out of those 8 kids, 6 would end up becoming liberals. Much to the annoyance of their parents, I might add.</comment>

<comment>Liberalism is falling on deaf ears today. You can only fool so many people with lies; big bang, global warming, second hand smoke, single payer health care, mass transit, and hate guns, hate whites, hate cars, hate oil companies, hate drug companies.Liberals are REALLY disgusting!</comment>

<comment>I'm curious now, are you a Poe?</comment>

<comment>When it comes to scientific method, I am a fundamentalist. No POE here.Much of the work I got, was being called in when a company's engineers were stuck. I rarely find Feynman's peave of flexible theories, I usually find out of control variables.</comment>

<comment>Second hand smoke?</comment>

<comment>I don't hate anyone, but I'm pretty sure I don't like you, you poor sad little victim of nothing.</comment>

<comment>And we're coming for you, Clark.... BWA-HA-HA-HA-HA!</comment>

<comment>You don't believe in the big bang?  Or you don't watch the show?  I don't follow, but then again I don't speak crazy person.</comment>

<comment>if we allow the majority of peer reviewed papers to deny the null hypothesis of anthropomorphic global warming, string, theory, and inflation cosmology, fisheries extinction, and tropical deforestation...then we are abandoning scientific method.Put in the simplest alarmist terms: Science has given us a lot. Giving up on science is going to cost a lot of money.</comment>

<comment>Your right, fanatical right wingers tend to be the enemies of democracy.  Eventually you get so fed up with not having 100% your way that someone in your party will try to seize power one day.  It happened before, it will happen again.  So yes, when you say we are your enemies yes, we want to do what is best for everyone.  Not just the people making 300k a year and think they are getting taxed 100% of that.  Trollie mactrollster.

<comment>Great job, Harvey! You've got 'em sputtering now! ;)</comment>

<comment>You are a racist! Conservatives don't care what color people are. That is really what irks you. We just don't care. None of us lived 150 years ago when slavery ended. NONE OF US. If you want to argue that growing up in an inner city slum was hard, I would point you straight back to the dumbazzes that created those slums and an environment where having more kids and no financial means to support them got you more money. Because Dems certainly know that giving tax breaks causes more of whatever the break was for, so they had to know what was going to happen!</comment>

<comment>You are purporting to speak for a large group of people at least some of whom make no secret about or apologies for caring about people's skin color. Some of the are even on these boards. If you're not a racist, good. If your point is that not all conservatives are racists, or even that most conservatives aren't racists, fine. Agreed. Way to recognize the basic dignity of your fellow humans. But making a broad generalization like that is just silly. There are plenty of racist conservatives. There are plenty of racist liberals. Racism is not something that we're likely to run out of soon in this country, and I don't see how anyone who is even remotely acquainted with our history or present can deny it. And, to that end, denying that racism exists, or that it affects our society (the long-ago death of slavery notwithstanding) is, in its own interesting way, kind of racist. One can be vehemently opposed to all sorts of (typically) liberal "solutions" to the effects of racism in our society without being a racist, but acting like 1868 was the last time any black person had cause for objection to the state of racism in America looks like willful ignorance. Y'know how I know that racism is still a big problem in America, beyond my ability to read statistics or my general awareness of political and social goings-on? Because I'm white, and, being white, I am more than familiar with the casual racism of white American discourse, even between relative strangers, when it's assumed or hoped that my whiteness means that I won't take offense. How does every black joke start? (Looks both ways to see if any black people are around and starts by whispering).</comment>

<comment>It's not limited to the us, you know, where people of other cultures achieve an equal footing rather quickly compared to other countries. Americans are far more accepting of other cultures and races than European countries or even India, China or the middle east.</comment>

<comment>Agreed that we are generally more accepting than many places in the world. The American experience of immigration and even slavery and its legacy are fairly unique in the world precisely because of the manner in which and principles on which we were founded and grew from that foundation. I find that when people read comments like the one I wrote, they think I am bashing America. I love America, think it is a great country, and think it could be even better with more acceptance and recognition of everyone's innate humanity. What won't work is whitewashing the past or fooling ourselves about the present.</comment>

<comment>Depends which European countries, some yes, some no.</comment>

<comment>I was there once when somebody did the look-around, asking "Are there any n***s here?" Sensing what was coming, I said, yeah, I'm one. And he didn't tell whatever damn joke he was getting set to curl down, so I was happy.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Republicans are so against tax breaks that they set up bribery systems for the sole purpose of making sure they get their tax breaks.  Hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>Actually if you replaced "black supremacy" and "Obama's supporters" in your angry racist trirade you would be 100% right.</comment>

<comment>Go live in Africa or China if you prefer another sort of supremacy.  I don't think you'll enjoy it.  There's a reason why all of *them* are making for the white countries -- and the whiter the better.</comment>

<comment>Gawd, what an idiotic, utterly insightless comment.</comment>

<comment>A lot of Trump supporters would openly admit to practicing identity politics. A lot of them don't attack opposing ideas so much as they attack opposing demographic groups like the establishment or immigrants.That's what makes it so terrifying. Identity politics is a very powerful tool. You can debate someone whose ideas are based on rational principles, but not someone who just wants a bigger slice of the pie for people like them. When minorities do it, it's usually just an annoyance because they don't have so much political power. When majorities do it, it leads to some pretty nasty authoritarianism.</comment>

<comment>bs -- you're nothing but a cultural apologist</comment>

<comment>Convincing retort...</comment>

<comment>A lot of Trump supporters would openly admit to practicing identity politics.bsNo, not really.  If you spend as little as half an hour reading Atlantic comments sections, you'll find that there are at least half a dozen open white supremacists who post here, and they unanimously support Trump.  Hell, they didn't start coming here with their neckbeard Nazi shtick until the Atlantic ran an article critical of Trump last summer.</comment>

<comment>You're just another partisan smear in this conversation</comment>

<comment>While you're obviously a ruggedly independent free-thinker, despite your seeming inability to actually reply to the substance of a comment.  Congratulations, you special snowflake, you!</comment>

<comment>Liar. I want to see white supremacist racist quotes. The only ones racist are the Atlantic paid trolls with multiple Avis and a few of their followers. It's all on the Left.Democrats are hands down the racists now! It's all over these articles and comment boards. </comment>

<comment>Go to any story on Fox News that mentions a black person (and many that don't), read the comments, and then say that, you disingenuous liar.</comment>

<comment>I doubt that - Fox deletes blatant racism. I never see blatant racism towards blacks here- just loads of anti-White comments  and articles. Check it out. </comment>

<comment>You are a liar. Foxnews comment boards are nothing but blatant racist statements. If you dont think so you are either racist, stupid, lying, or all three. Keep up your nonsense by all means, people have caught on to what "conservative principals" really means and will never elect another republican president.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry, but you must be new here.  A whole bunch of these folks from an "alt-right" site called The Right Stuff, a 4hcan offshoot devoted mostly to old-school anti-Semitic and racist cartoons and writing, started trolling this site heavily around the end of last summer.I'm not going to link it here, but if you Google their site and look through the comments section, you'll recognize more than a few posters who show up here.  You can even, if you look through older threads, find these people coordinating trolling sessions of Atlantic articles.  A bunch of them are still here; I assume the rest are too busy with their high school work.Most of these folks are cowards who keep their comment histories set to "private," but not all of them.  If you look through TRS, though, you can see the "private" commenters here posting there.Maybe, instead of just calling people liars for saying things you find hard to believe, you should actually think a little and look at things for yourself.</comment>

<comment>I'm just talking about this site. I don't see blatant racism except from the liberals. Some openly admit hating Whites. They have posted their hatred directly to me. Thanks Obama.</comment>

<comment>I don't see blatant racism except from the liberals.I think you're only seeing what you want to see.  Here's an example of what I'm talking about, from just yesterday:https://disqus.com/home/discus...Sorry to burst your bubble, but like I said: There are a few commenters on this site who are regular posters on actual no-shit white supremacist sites, and those posters unanimously support Trump.  I don't think it's fair to say that all Trump supporters are racist, but it's a plain fact that the neo-Nazi contingent are happy as hell that he's running.</comment>

<comment>Ok. I get that. But did you know Trump has never said anything racist. He had a stmt misquoted about Mexicans and also just said we have to do a temp ban on Muslims because that  is where these terrorists are coming from. He can't help that they are brown people. He and his supporters are being trashed and they are all perfectly fine letting in all of this to our country. If KKK people were mass terrorists today, I would want them out of our country or in GITMO. It's not a skin color thing at all. And I'm tired of being called a Nazi etc after all I've done for minorities. It's rude. I don't  say racist things. </comment>

<comment>I would just point out that it's not just liberals calling Trump racist, it's also people who proudly call themselves racists, and hear in Trump's speeches a lot that they agree with.  But thanks for civilly disagreeing.</comment>

<comment>We don't even know yet the amount of support Trump is receiving from liberal quarters. I imagine it's going to be quite a lot as conservatives are not the only group disgusted with their political elites.</comment>

<comment>Bernie and Trump have similar views on immigration.From a recent Bernie interview with Ezra Klein: "Open borders? That's  Koch Brothers proposal. That's a right-wing proposal which says, essentially, there is no United States. It would make everybody in America poorer. You're doing away with the concept of a nation state and I don't think there's any country in the world which believes in that. If you believe in a nation state, or a country called the United States, or the UK, or Denmark, or any other country, you have an obligation to do everything we can in my view to help poor people. What right-wing people in this country would love is an open-border policy: Bring in a bunch of people who would work for $2 to $3 an hour. That would be great for them. Do you know what youth unemployment in the United States of America is? If you're white 33%, hispanic 36%, African American 51%. Do you think we should open the border and allow in a bunch of low-wage workers?"</comment>

<comment>Oh goody.   Left wing radicals Conor and Harvey telling conservatives what conservatism is.</comment>

<comment>I thought Conor was your man, he's always going on about political correctness. But the revolution marches onward and new Enemies of the People are exposed every day, I suppose.</comment>

<comment>He is not so bad.  I just don't like people calling themselves conservatives who are not.  It really bothers me.  I don't call myself one.  I am not one.</comment>

<comment>What do you call yourself?Want to know what I call you?  Never mind....</comment>

<comment>I don't answer a-holes.  Most know this.</comment>

<comment>I am a nice girl.  You seem....nasty.</comment>

<comment>OK, so, I'll bite.  What do you call me?  I want to know.  You claim to be "nice".  I am sure I will regret asking.</comment>

<comment>Lizzie.  You know, Lizzie the Lizard.</comment>

<comment>I knew you were an a-hole.</comment>

<comment>I mean it with affection.  You seem to have a chip on your shoulder.  Why?</comment>

<comment>:-)  OK, well, I have more hostile followers than I can count.  Calling someone lizzie the lizard is not a normal form of endearment.  The Iguana's name is Pedro.  OK, whatever, so you are "nice".   Nice to meet you.  I cannot share any personal info, I never will,  I don't really care if you are friend or foe.</comment>

<comment>Why do people dislike you so, Pedro?</comment>

<comment>F*ck off</comment>

<comment>There you go again!  I am being nice. I am even calling you Pedro as you said.  I am trying to be sympathetic.What is wrong?  Did you have a bad day?  Do you need a foot rub?</comment>

<comment>Go take a bottle of pills,  then jump off a bridge.</comment>

<comment>I am starting to see why people don't like you.  Your life must be really horrible for you to be so mean inside.I am going base jumping today, so I will take you up on the bridge. No pills for me, though.  Seems like you might need them.</comment>

<comment>yr no grl</comment>

<comment>You have no answer,it seems. Too bad.</comment>

<comment>If Conor is a left-wing radical then William F. Buckley was a Trotskyite.</comment>

<comment>What is conservatism these days?  Based on your roster of candidates, it's impossible to tell what real conservatives stand for these days. </comment>

<comment>You're saying what we currently have is coherent?</comment>

<comment>Harvey is a left wing radical SJW who prides himself on how subversive he can be.  Ignore him.</comment>

<comment>"Subversive?" Is that your way of telling me I'm first against the wall? 'Cause I'll tell you now, my brand is American Spirits.</comment>

<comment>We are the party of freedom.  We like you.</comment>

<comment>Aww, I love you too, Big Brother</comment>

<comment>Yeah, uh, I know you are illiterate, but Big Brother was a left winger.  Ask Christopher Hitchens, a rare honest socialist.</comment>

<comment>So you've hitched yourself to Hitch, huh? Man, talk about trollish provocateurs playing the subversive. If I weren't a good Catholic I might worship him instead.</comment>

<comment>I love Hitch. He is great.  Like I said, I lean left.  I like his atheism.  I watched his debates endlessly on-line on YouTube.   I employ a lot of his [truly admirable] debating tactics.  It is a shame you don't.</comment>

<comment>Eh, I've never really been able to listen to that "skeptic" crowd. IMO they hold themselves in too high esteem and most of their arguments seem to be based on lecturing their audience or opponents about how Team Skeptic is superior to the rest of the Cro-Mags.Also, they want a pat on the back for "figuring out" God isn't real. Big whoop, I figured out Santa wasn't real when I was eight. If faith were easy there would be no point and God would just be a sky dictator addressing us daily. But there are two kinds of narcissists: the kind who believes they're acting on behalf of God and the kind that believes they are God.</comment>

<comment>I am much more interested in converting you away from your rabid leftism.  :-)  I don't think you are the type of Christian who wants to deny evolution and have prayer in schools.</comment>

<comment>Hell no! I'm pro-science and pro-liberty</comment>

<comment>Populist racist nationalist conservatism is the classic strategy of oligarchy.</comment>

<comment>It's not "inverse".  It is the oldest, most dominant strain.  The populism just pulls back the curtain.</comment>

<comment>Nope.  Populist conservatism is the result of dissatisfaction with the way their elected officials did not do their bidding.</comment>

<comment>True, "conservatism" is a label without a definite meaning.Trump is above all a nationalist- protect the people by protecting borders; protect our wealth and jobs by protecting business from unfair trade deals.Strong military, well run, hardly used.Get serious about the budget, get rid of waste.Strength, self-belief in America as good.Vote Trump!</comment>

<comment>I would say the same of partisan politics in general.  Most voters of any stripe do not have a coherent policy stance.</comment>

<comment>Ding! Ding! Ding!  You nailed it.</comment>

<comment>Not really sure how to parse your sentence. I think populism almost by definition usually involves some kind of identity politics, conservative/liberal or whatever, so what are 'inverse identity politics'? Like, politics that *aren't* based on identity? I'm confused.</comment>

<comment>We can agree if you change the term to Populist politics in general, it's as ineffective on the left as it is on the right....</comment>

<comment>The closest to a populist conservative in the race now is Ted Cruz, as a Latino what would 'inverse identity politics' mean to him?</comment>

<comment>“No,” Trump answered. “The people that I do best with drive the taxis,”Which tells me that the anti-immigrant Trump hasn't been in a taxi in, oh, a good two decades at least. But I bet he'd clean up with Ernest Borgnine's character in Escape From New York!</comment>

<comment>You will be surprised to learn that some cabbies are actually legal residents (even citizens). And they don't much appreciate being forced out of business by the invaders.</comment>

<comment>No one is surprised that many taxi drivers are 1) legal residents and 2)citizens.  So who are the invaders? Legal residents form other countries? Trump doesn't seem to realize that many taxi drivers are legal immigrants. So Harvey's comment stands, and yours sort of flops on the ground.</comment>

<comment>You cock sucking lying piece of treasonous crap. We will murdering  traitor. You will hang for this.</comment>

<comment>Those cabbies have more to fear from Uber than any immigrant amigo and their unions seem to realize that.</comment>

<comment>Cabbies have unions?</comment>

<comment>Yes.https://news.vice.com/article/...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>You are a cock sucking traitor and we will kill you before this is over you fool.</comment>

<comment>Come and get me.</comment>

<comment>give it time traitor.,</comment>

<comment>Legal residents - yes. But vast majority of them are immigrants.</comment>

<comment>"Legal residents - yes. But vast majority of them are immigrants."So were your ancestors;I know, there is a difference. Your ancestors were white.</comment>

<comment>So was me, for that matter.</comment>

<comment>And your point would be that you refuse to disti guish between legality and illegality. Yet you want us to change the laws. Why should anyone give a FF what you think about laws? Obey the present laws of the land or suffer the consequences. We will expel the invaders lock and stock. Anyone who stand is our way will meet a traitors fate. We mean business and we will be avenged for the deaths that have caused and then  we will take care of the traitors. Blood will flow in plent before we are done. Let the illegals and the traitors be warned,. We now know of your genocide against our brave American workers and the millions dead wi;ll be avenged in full with intertest. Prepare for mortal battle you blood soaked fools. The game is over and justice will be done. are not backing bown. So get you MF guns ready because there is nothing sadder than o=someone who only brings a knofe to a gun fight.  The we will discuss making new one.</comment>

<comment>The immigrants have menopolized this trade because they undercut the prices that American born drivers demand and need to support a decent lifrestyle. So enjoy being driven around by your cheap foreign slave chauffeur. I prefer the company of free men and we will so see that you eat your treasonous greed. You will see the short end of a rope before this is through traitor. We will have revenge. Mark my word you cock sucking murderous shit.</comment>

<comment>I am the guy who buys and sells that revenge of yours in bulk. So go ahead, throw a few more tantrums. You are amusing.</comment>

<comment>Laugh while you may, fat boy.</comment>

<comment>Which means that myself, my kids and their kids will grow old and die laughing at you.</comment>

<comment>Treason is only laughable if you win.</comment>

<comment>I already did.</comment>

<comment>Anti-immigrant is not what Trump stands for and he is NOT my guy. He wants documented and enforced migration. Otherwise, you don't have a country because you have no sovereignty. That was one of the changes that Obama promised and you must support! Again, you are the racist that sees race in immigration. Not conservatives. If the immigration process is broken, well that is expected. Because big government is only as smart as its dumbest person. With Obama in charge, it was doomed at the start. Easier to avoid registering and see what happens when you get here. That isn't much of a policy.</comment>

<comment>Good point. Also, "Mexican" is not a race.  Neither is "Muslim".</comment>

<comment>Trump is pro immigrant big time.  Unlike Harvey, Trump is for income equality.  If you favor mass illegal immigration like Harvey (pro open borders), then you have a hard-on for income inequality.  You are in league with the 1%-ers who pay their nannies, drivers, and gardeners exploitative wages.</comment>

<comment>Ridiculous. If my town kicks all the homeless people out, income inequality would fall in my town, but no one who is honestly against inequality would support kicking all the homeless people out because that policy doesn't actually reduce inequality--it just shifts it from my town to other towns.Someone who argued that we should kick the poor homeless people out of their town to reduce inequality probably has an ulterior motive like protecting local property values that he is just trying to cover up with lofty rhetoric. Same with people who argue that we should kick poor immigrants out of the country.</comment>

<comment>The is 100% a lie, or stupidity, or both.  Income Equality means for the people within community, citizens.  We cannot make the whole world equal.</comment>

<comment>Well, good thing empirical evidence has shown that immigration has a small effect on inequality:</comment>

<comment>I am not sure why we should spend time trying to work through the ideological underpinnings of Rush Limbaugh. The guy isn't an academic or philosopher. He is an entertainer who sells cash for gold ads to old people. He would cheat on the whole country if it made him better off.</comment>

<comment>That's the definition of a conservative.</comment>

<comment>Just ask George Soros, Warren Buffet, Bill Gates,Michael Bloomberg and all of the rest of the "liberal" left's cadre of billionaire international criminals.</comment>

<comment>Bill Gates is an international criminal?</comment>

<comment>He seems to assume criminal means people with who he disagrees politically. Darth does seem to be an authoritarian.</comment>

<comment>As is Warren Buffet, apparently.</comment>

<comment>According to the anti-corporatists on the left he is.</comment>

<comment>Michael Bloomberg is a liberal?</comment>

<comment>He's pro-gun control, along with a host of other pros like abortion-on-demand & illegal alien rights. That makes him a liberal.</comment>

<comment>That might be a liberal on social issues, but there are many more issues than those you mention.</comment>

<comment>According to the "liberal" left, Obama (who leans to the left on social issues) is to the right of Bernie Sanders, on economic & political issues. Yet nobody calls him a Conservative. Q.E.D. Bloomberg leans to the left on social issues, Bloomberg is a Liberal.</comment>

<comment>Is there some official liberal who defines these terms and who is what?  For that matter is there some official conservative who does that?</comment>

<comment>If Obama's liberal, then Bloomberg is liberal; there's not *that* much to choose between their positions. But I fear that the word "liberal" is being defined pretty haphazardly these days.</comment>

<comment>Who cares about them?</comment>

<comment>Meh, I think there are a lot of decent conservatives out there with good principles.  It's just that in our current toxic political culture, being decent and principled is not likely to lead to electoral success or to celebrity status.  Being bombastic, oversimplistic and partisan leads to much more success in elections and in the marketplace.The problem is not our politicians, but ourselves.</comment>

<comment>To find "decent conservatives" one needs to be an anthropologist. They may have existed in the past but are now extinct.</comment>

<comment>"To find "decent conservatives" one needs to be an anthropologist. They may have existed in the past but are now extinct."___Two points:1. I've met decent conservatives who happen not to be extinct.2. Are you under the impression that anthropologists do field work interviewing "extinct" people in order to understand them better? If so, do you think they get freaked out when the extinct people answer their questions? If an extinct person ever talks to me, I know I'll freak out over it.</comment>

<comment>conservatives as a whole as much better people than egalitariansits barely even possible to believe in equality and be decent at the same time</comment>

<comment>Given the opinions of some of the so-called "academics" or philosophers, Limbaugh's views have far more validity and grounding than the entirety of the "liberal" left -which abandoned Liberalism long ago.And have you seen the volume of Cash-for-Gold ads that run in most of the "liberal" left's publications? Obviously not, since if it's not on Twitter it doesn't exist in your world.</comment>

<comment>No not really. If you're referring to online ads those are targeted based on what you've searched for. I get mainly tech stuff and travel.</comment>

<comment>....says someone who listens to liberal  media opinion instead of Rush himself. </comment>

<comment>" He would cheat on the whole country if it made him better off."What do you mean "would"?That's exactly what he has been doing since day one.</comment>

<comment>For those who have ever spent any time in high school cafeterias, locker rooms, college dorms, or military barracks, Limbaugh's type is quite familiar. In such settings, there is always at least one person who is a loud mouth and who specializes in rude, crude, and socially objectionable banter, especially in put-downs of those who are already not well thought-of. One can always see right through this act as a desperate attempt of a person who knows they are inferior to attract attention and popularity their way, given that there is no other way with which they could properly earn it.</comment>

<comment>Yep.  It works.  It is what I do and everyone hates me.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, clown.So, how are things over at Infowars? Has Alex managed to connect Obama to those aerial cattle mutilations yet?</comment>

<comment>Do feel free to prove me wrong... if you can, clown.</comment>

<comment>Ever since W, the GOP has been increasingly removed from traditional conservatism</comment>

<comment>I think that's when it became visible.  One can make a case that the rise of Christian fundamentalism within the GOP has the party away from traditional conservatism, and that's been going on for over 30 years.</comment>

<comment>Even HW thought the early religious right heads were insane and bad for the party, he was right.</comment>

<comment>I like and respect Bush 41 quite a bit, but guys like him are scarce these days.</comment>

<comment>I do as well, I think he's a tragically underrated president since he was conservative but not ideologically up his own ass.</comment>

<comment>And who does represent traditional conservatism? The free-spending, deficits don't matter, global interventionist, immigrant-loving Reagan?</comment>

<comment>Love or hate Reagan, the country did far better under Reaganomics than it ever did under Obama.</comment>

<comment>For who? The wealthy? Then yes.</comment>

<comment>What part of "the country" was unclear?</comment>

<comment>Probably the part that was wrecked by the crack cocaine epidemic, or the parts where HIV/AIDS exploded while Reagan pretended it didn't exist. Or the parts where poverty increased drastically under Reagan while wages for everyone outside the upper class remained flat and productivity growth began to decline.What was that you were saying again?</comment>

<comment>"Probably the part that was wrecked by the crack cocaine epidemic"That's a law enforcement issue, not a Presidential policy issue. NEXT"or the parts where HIV/AIDS exploded while Reagan pretended it didn't exist"Also not a Presidential policy issue, since the President does not determine how the medical research industry operates. NEXT"Or the parts where poverty increased drastically under Reagan"Yea, for people who didn't want to work for a living. I noticed that welfare fraud was rampant as well."while wages for everyone outside the upper class remained flat"Also not the President's job to dictate how much a private company paid it's employees.I repeat: What part of "the country" was unclear?</comment>

<comment>The part where "country" means America, because you're clearly not speaking of America. Productivity dipped under Reagan, wages went stagnant, and social policy was a disaster. He allowed Islamic extremism to grow in the Middle East by cutting and running faster than the French military could ever dream of surrendering."That's a law enforcement issue, not a Presidential policy issue. NEXT"Yeah, it had nothing to do with people he put in positions of power flooding our streets with the garbage in an effort to fund paramilitary members after their funding was cut off, right? Keep that head buried deep champ.</comment>

<comment>" Productivity dipped under Reagan"Riiiiiiiiiight. And the low unemployment numbers that dominated the Reagan Presidency back up that claim -NOT."wages went stagnant,"I repeat: It's not the President's job to dictate how much a private company pay it's employees."and social policy was a disaster"Also not the President's job to determine what "liberal" social issue du jure is relevant or not."He allowed Islamic extremism to grow in the Middle East"At the behest of the clearly stated opinion of the majority of the American people. Not Reagan's fault that he (unlike the "liberal" left) actually paid attention to what the voters said."by cutting and running faster than the French military could ever dream of surrendering."Wrong again. The French surrendered to Germany after a month (plus 10 days) of fighting. The US withdrew from Lebanon (the "cut and run" you are referring to) after a year and 6 months. Do the math."it had nothing to do with people he put in positions of power flooding our streets with the garbage"Riiiiiiight. These people had to divide their time between office work and time on the streets, selling coke."in an effort to fund paramilitary members after their funding was cut off,"Why don't you ask any of the tens-of-thousands of Mesquito Indians, slaughtered by the Ortega government, if they were happy to see Ortega and his "socialist" government toppled -oh wait, you can't because they're dead.Face it, that leftist government in Nicaragua that you lefties love so much was a murderous regime (like most communist governments were).Facts help. Try some, for once, champ.</comment>

<comment>"Riiiiiiiiiight. And the low unemployment numbers that dominated the Reagan Presidency back up that claim -NOT."You mean the one's that took until the late 80s to appear and quickly vanished after Reagan left office? Sure, you stick with that lol."I repeat: It's not the President's job to dictate how much a private company pay it's employees"Oh okay, so than you clearly don't blame Pres. Obama for the employment issues facing America, right? Oh wait... you do. Lol, I guess it's only good for the goose but not for the gander eh? And weren't you just praising Reagan's low unemployment figures. I suppose only Democratic presidents affect employment and wages. SMDH..."Also not the President's job to determine what "liberal" social issue du jure is relevant or not."No, the leader of the free world that stands for freedom and democracy totally gets to just ignore social issues. That's why Pres. Obama is never faulted for the riots that occurred in Baltimore or the growing partisan divide in America. Oh wait... you blame him for both of those lol. Your hypocrisy is only matched by your ignorance of history."Not Reagan's fault that he (unlike the "liberal" left) actually paid attention to what the voters said."LMFAO!!! So now Reagan wasn't a great decider but merely a "policy by poll" figure. Great leader you've picked to idolize. LMFAO!!! I guess it was the will of the American people to sell weapons to Iran also, right? And, I assume you don't blame Obama for the rise of ISIL in Iraq or for pulling troops out of Iraq... oh wait, you do."Riiiiiiight. These people had to divide their time between office work and time on the streets, selling coke."You might want to read the Kerry report there champ. You clearly don't know a thing about how the CIA and State Dept. funded known drug dealers under Reagan's admin."Why don't you ask any of the tens-of-thousands"So just for the record, crack cocaine distribution is a-ok as long as it supports violent rebels (but only if they're fighting socialists). WOW!!!!"Facts help. Try some, for once, champ."Like the "fact" you stated about the CRA? Or well... anything? LOL! You've been proven wrong time and time and time again and you think facts are on your side?!? LMFAO!!! ROFL!!! Dude you are riot.</comment>

<comment>"You mean the one's that took until the late 80s to appear and quickly vanished after Reagan left office?"Putting aside the fact that Presidents don't have any say in whether or not a company hires,  these same tired old "liberal" talking points have been long debunked.Funny how Reagan somehow managed to get re-elected by one of the biggest landslides in history, despite this "dreadful" economy you "liberals" claim his administration caused.  As I've said, this nonsense of yours was debunked, long ago."Oh okay, so than you clearly don't blame Pres. Obama for the employment issues facing America"Oh what's the matter, can't stand having your own tactics thrown back in your face? If Bush & the GOP were responsible for the "worst economy in history," with "massive unemployment (which never rose above 5%)," then Obama & the Democrats can be blamed for the lousy shape the current employment situation is in. Turn-about is fair play. Live with it."I suppose only Democratic presidents affect employment and wages. SMDH..."Why not? It's clear that (to you and others of your political bent) only Republicans effect employment and wages. Said it before and I'll say it again: Turn-about is fair play. Live with it."That's why Pres. Obama is never faulted for the riots that occurred in Baltimore"He is faulted for openly siding with those who claim the cops murdered Freddy Gray, BEFORE an official investigation had been conducted. I don't care how outraged you are, the United States is NOT a country where justice is dispensed at the whim of the mob."So now Reagan wasn't a great decider but merely a "policy by poll" figure."Actually, he was known as "The Great Communicator," which means he was a consensus builder. Just ask any of the Reagan Democrats. Facts help. Try some, for once."LMFAO!!"It is not considered healthy, on a mental or physical health level, to laugh at your own jokes so hard that your gluteus maximus falls off. As far as the will of the people is concerned, it's funny how that was sacrosanct, during the 2000 election, but is meaningless (to the left) when the will-o-the-people was against Obamacare or gun control. Another one of those sliding-scales you far-out-in-left-field-kooks live by." I assume you don't blame Obama for the rise of ISIL"Well he DID embrace the "Arab Spring," where the he[[ to you think ISIL got it's start?"You might want to read the Kerry report there champ"John Kerry -not THERE's an example of "competent" & "objective" investigation. ROFLMATHO!"So just for the record, crack cocaine distribution is a-ok as long as it supports violent rebels (but only if they're fighting socialists). WOW!!!!"Nice dodge of the fact that your socialist "utopia," down there was committing BOSNIAN style mass murder. You "liberals" will always come up with excuses for the crimes of your socialist or communist idols."Like the "fact" you stated about the CRA?"Feel free to prove me wrong (as if you can)." You've been proven wrong time and time and time again"No, you haven't proven me wrong once, boy. But keep trying, you might stumble onto something... eventually."and you think facts are on your side?!"No, I don't think facts are on my side. I KNOW it.</comment>

<comment>"Funny how Reagan somehow managed to get re-elected"Same reason Obama did, the previous President from the other party screwed up so bad American were willing to deal with tepid, uninspired growth. Like Obama, Reagan employed moving rhetoric as well. If nothing else Reagan was one he // va speaker."Oh what's the matter, can't stand having your own tactics thrown back in your face? "LMAO!! FYI, this is me laughing AT you. YOU are the one running around complaining about the "Obama economy" and then when Reagan's weak numbers are presented, or how his policies destroyed the middle class... suddenly, the President isn't "really responsible for that." LMAO!! Dude... you are the worst kind of stupid- arrogantly stupid."then Obama & the Democrats can be blamed for the lousy shape the current employment situation is in"Indeed, I do credit the Democrats for the current shape of the economy, which, despite Republican attempts to thwart real progress is much better off than when the GOP took the reigns and ran us into a ditch through unfunded excursions to finish Daddy's work and tax cuts for the wealthy. So... yeah. I'll take where we are today over THAT disaster. Tepid growth is better than nearly causing the second great depression."I don't care how outraged you are, the United States is NOT a country where justice is dispensed at the whim of the mob"And here's more of the bedrock of modern "conservatives"- hypocrisy. So once again, Reagan is not responsible for ignoring glaring domestic issues (one of which his admin directly caused), but Obama is responsible for years of frustration in the black community finally reaching a boiling point. And Obama never ONCE supported "the whim of the mob" but directly OPPOSED it. Your hypocrisy is only matched by your ability to slant history to fit your twisted ideological goals."where the he[[ to you think ISIL got it's start?"Afghanistan, 1999, when Abu al-Zarqawi formed what would turn into the current group known by varying names, including ISIL. Once again, you REALLY don't have a clue. But good try slugger. Maybe you're next swing won't be a total and utter miss."Actually, he was known as "The Great Communicator," which means he was a consensus builder"OMG... HOMERUN!! As I said above, if nothing else, Reagan could talk. He was an actor..."John Kerry -not THERE's an example of "competent" & "objective" investigation. "You can prove it wrong... by laughing at it? LMFAO!!! ROFL!!!!"Feel free to prove me wrong (as if you can)."Yeah... already did this when you tried to claim the CRA was initiated by Clinton, despite it being passed in 1977 and signed into law by Jimmy Carter. Wanna try again, you got at least one right this time."No, you haven't proven me wrong once, boy. But keep trying"LMFAO!! ROFL!!! You're funny if nothing else sport.</comment>

<comment>"Same reason Obama did, the previous President from the other party screwed up so bad"Wrong. The economy was already far worse under Obama & his party's screw ups than it ever was under Bush. The plain-and-simple fact is, Obama got re-elected because:1) He's black.2) His opponent was a human sleeping pill." and then when Reagan's weak numbers are presented,"You mean the proven Democrat LIES about Reagan's numbers." suddenly, the President isn't "really responsible for that." LMAO!! Dude... you are the worst kind of stupid- arrogantly stupid."Not even a TENTH as stupid as morons like you, who don't even see you're being made a fool of, by having your own arguments turned around on you. Typical "liberal" through and through." I do credit the Democrats for the current shape of the economy, which, despite Republican attempts to thwart real progress is much better off than when the GOP took the reigns"Blah blah blah -same old "liberal" talking points. Do you have ANY actual thoughts of your own? Obviously you don't or never have owned real property, paid a mortgage or paid any real taxes/bills.Only a non-thinking type (usually a millennial)  would think the first 2 years of the Obama regime saw economic progress." And Obama never ONCE supported "the whim of the mob" but directly OPPOSED it."Riiiiiiight. And the rioters who burned Ferguson, Mo. were really "peaceful" & "lawful" as Obama said."Afghanistan, 1999, when Abu al-Zarqawi formed what would turn into the current group known by varying names, including ISIL"Which was nothing more than a has-been remnant of "Al Qaeda in Iraq." Until the "Arab Spring," to which Obama gave his blessing.al Zarqawi was killed in 2006. ISIL started it's dust up in 2010. Who was President in 2010? "The buck stops here." -a sign on the desk of President Harry S. Truman."You can prove it wrong... by laughing at it? LMFAO!!! ROFL!!!!"It's called CREDIBILITY. Kerry has little to none at all. From his man-of-a-thousand-disguises Presidential campaign to his statements of support or sympathy toward Muslim extremism, Kerry is just about as anti-American as you can get, short of an act of treason. If he told me the sky was sky was blue, I'd still look up. And his reports have no credibility or validity either. Just ask Congressional democrats."already did this when you tried to claim the CRA was initiated by Clinton"Still dodging Clinton & the Democrat party's complicity in the collapse of the home loan industry I see."You're funny if nothing else sport."Nice dodge, yet again.</comment>

<comment>Lmfao!! This entire post of rambling nonsense proved nothing I said wrong. Literally nothing. You've been proven wrong more times than I have fingers and toes which means it's time to stop toying with you... You're clearly a child who can't admit when they're wrong. Later sport.</comment>

<comment>"This entire post of rambling nonsense proved nothing I said wrong"Nor could anybody else, I'm sure."You've been proven wrong more times than I have fingers and toes"Really?

<comment>The economy did far better under Clinton than it did under Reagan. The middle class began to loose income under Reagan, recovered under Clinton, dived under Bush and recovered somewhat under Obama.</comment>

<comment>"The economy did far better under Clinton than it did under Reagan."Riiiiiiight, which is why the Democrats were voted out of control of Congress, after just 2 years of Democrat party control -because the economy was so "grand" under Clinton."The middle class began to loose income under Reagan"Funny, the US Census Bureau says that middle class income rose, during the Reagan years."recovered under Clinton"Wrong. It tipped downward during Clinton's first term and started upward again in his second (with the GOP in control of Congress)."dived under Bush"Gee, I wonder why. Couldn't possibly have anything to do with the dot-com bubble burst. And btw, a loss of $2000 of annual income is hardly a "dive.""and recovered somewhat under Obama."Wrong. It is under Obama that incomes have "dived." A $6000 loss of income, under Obama & the Democrats watch is most certainly a dive.</comment>

<comment>Reagan didn't come into office facing the biggest financial crisis since the 30's.  Reagan also didn't embrace austerity the same way the modern GOP has on both a federal and state level.  But Reagan did fact unemployment over 10%, and that was after massive tax cuts.  So you may want to reconsider this statement because the data doesn't support it.</comment>

<comment>"Reagan didn't come into office facing the biggest financial crisis since the 30's."That's true. And he also didn't have to hide from the fact that his own party created the economic crisis, like Obama has had to."Reagan also didn't embrace austerity the same way the modern GOP has on both a federal and state level"You said it yourself, Reagan didn't come in facing the biggest financial crisis since the 1930s."But Reagan did face unemployment over 10%, and that was after massive tax cuts."Yea for 1 year and it had nothing to do with tax cuts (which have nothing to do with the creation of private sector jobs). Also, throughout the bulk of his presidency, Reagan did not have to doctor the unemployment figures (as the Obama administration has) to create the illusion of a working country.Actually, the data does support my statement.</comment>

<comment>So what did Obama's party do to cause the financial crisis?</comment>

<comment>The Community Reinvestment Act (which caused the collapse of the home loan industry) was a Clinton era creation.During the 1st term of G. W. Bush, it was Congressional Democrats who opposed tightening the regulations (that were loosened by the CRA), calling the effort (by Congressional Republicans, at the urging of Bush) "racist."</comment>

<comment>That's been debunked:https://rortybomb.wordpress.co...</comment>

<comment>That is not a debunk. That is nothing more than the opinion of a cadre of left wing economists who support Keynesian Economics.</comment>

<comment>Well, he basically took the argument that you presented and eviscerated it.  The financial crisis has been researched and researched for many years.  It's not my fault or problem that you're hermetically sealed from reality.  :)</comment>

<comment>The only people "hermetically sealed from reality" are those (usually on the "liberal" left) who give credibility to far-from-objective "economists" who blame banks for a financial crisis which even their own political party attributes to the loosening of lending regulations to the CRA.</comment>

<comment>Then we can agree to disagree and move forward.</comment>

<comment>"The Community Reinvestment Act (which caused the collapse of the home loan industry) was a Clinton era creation."LMFAO!!! Does history begin and end with Reagan for you? The CRA was signed into law by Pres. Jimmy Carter in 1977 you dolt.</comment>

<comment>The CRA's premise, that every American should own a home, was a flawed concept to begin with. But you're right, it was loosened by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which Clinton backed.</comment>

<comment>And do remind everyone, what political party did Gramm, Leach, and Bliley all belong to again? They must have been Democrats since you clearly stated earlier the fault lied at the feet of the Democratic party.And don't play like Clinton had much choice on signing it or not. The bill was veto proof when it arrived on his desk. He absolutely should have forced them to ovveride his veto but the Glass-Stegal repeals of the late 90s were 100% GOP led policies. Your (failed) attempt to lay them at the feet of the Democratic party is hilarious.</comment>

<comment>"And do remind everyone, what political party did Gramm, Leach, and Bliley all belong to again?"And do remind ME of when I ever said that the GOP was blameless."They must have been Democrats since you clearly stated earlier the fault lied at the feet of the Democratic party."1) The Congressional democrats are ON RECORD for opposing tightening of the lending regulations, during the Bush administration. Many of whom called the attempt "racist."2) If George W. Bush is to be blamed for the rise in the national debt, because he signed the tax cut bill into law, then Bill Clinton gets the blame for signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Live with it."The bill was veto proof when it arrived on his desk."Not big on facts, are you? The bill passed the house vote by 241 vs 132. And it passed the Senate vote 54 to 44. That's not veto proof."Your (failed) attempt to lay them at the feet of the Democratic party is hilarious"So Bush is responsible because he signed the tax cut bill & the invasion of Iraq. But Clinton gets a pass for signing the bill that caused far more damage than all of Bush's tax cuts and Iraq combined.Gotta love that sliding-scale you "liberals" live by.</comment>

<comment>"And do remind ME of when I ever said that the GOP was blameless."LMFAO!!! Your words: "he also didn't have to hide from the fact that his own party created the economic crisis, like Obama has had to."Point me to where you blamed the GOP here, and didn't lay the entire economic crisis at the feet of Democratic party." If George W. Bush is to be blamed for the rise in the national debt, because he signed the tax cut bill into law, then Bill Clinton gets the blame for signing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Live with it."LMFAO!! George Bush PROPOSED the tax cuts! ROFLMAO!! Dude you are hopeless. It's all the Democrats and the GOP is blameless, until you want to fake blame them to pretend your not a rabid partisan hack."The bill passed the house vote by 241 vs 132. And it passed the Senate vote 54 to 44. That's not veto proof."Yeah... you need to read Wikipedia better next time champ lol.Yeas- 90, Nays- 8https://www.govtrack.us/congre...Yeas- 362, Nays- 57https://www.govtrack.us/congre..."So Bush is responsible because he signed the tax cut bill & the invasion of Iraq. But Clinton gets a pass for signing the bill that caused far more damage than all of Bush's tax cuts and Iraq combined."Once again, there is NO comparison here. Bush proposed the tax cuts and the invasion of Iraq, Clinton did not propose the repeal of Glass-Stegal. Nice try though hack.</comment>

<comment>Also, PS, I didn't give Clinton a pass. I specifically said he should have forced Congress to override his veto but did not.</comment>

<comment>War is the truest form of divination. It is the testing of one’s will and the will of another within the larger will which because it binds them is therefore forced to select. War is the ultimate game because war is at last a forcing of the unity of existence. War is god.</comment>

<comment>Even IF Jeb Bush is personally conservative, his administration would be an ever growing government just like those that are currently running the Republican wing of the Democratic party. Trump is a nut. He is a narcissist. He flies off the handle. But there are very few things that he has said that I haven't thought myself. Dropping Byrdall off in the middle of the desert sounds like a good starting point. And do you REALLY think Iran would have taken a Navy vessel or shot missiles near our aircraft carriers?!!! And these terrorists that are being allowed into the country (and given aid, cash, and a free place to live by Obama and his drones) would get in? Probably round them up and drop them off with Byrdall.Obama likes to cry about the situation he found himself facing when he became President... but he wasn't 20 trillion in debt, a failed nationwide health insurance racket, nearly 75% unemployment rate (they stopped counting those that aren't eligible for benefits), aging population getting ready to leave the workplace and drain social security, massive migration of millions of islamic terrorists into the US, and a destabilized Middle East in which there are now warring Islamic factions with nuclear weapons and ambitions. Thanks Obama, for nothing!</comment>

<comment>Jeb! Bush is not a conservative.  Neither was his brother.  RINOs do not get to harp about ideological purity.  </comment>

<comment>You decide who is and isn't a conservative? You say you are not a conservative. Might you be mistaken?</comment>

<comment>Conservatism and republicanism are two different isms.</comment>

<comment>No, this is not true. Right and Conservative are the same thing.</comment>

<comment>Conservatism and republicanism are two different isms.No kidding.  Especially when the the most left-leaning of the Democratic candidates keeps opining about the glories of the Eisenhower administration.</comment>

<comment>"And do you REALLY think Iran would have taken a Navy vessel or shot missiles near our aircraft carriers?!!!"  Yes.Part of any responsible conservatism includes a sense of proportionality and restraint.  We don't hear either from Trump or the other GOP hopefuls.  And as it turned out, our sailors were released less than 24 hours later.  A reasonable person would consider that a win.  What would Trump have done differently, and how would that achieve the desired result better than what Obama/Kerry did?"and a destabilized Middle East in which there are now warring Islamic factions with nuclear weapons and ambitions".  There are 3 countries in that part of the world with nuclear weapons.  Israel happens to be one of them.  Iran is a nuclear power and is legally entitled to such a program as they are a signee of the NPT.  Where Israel has had nukes for years, that has not led to an arms race, has it?  As for a destabilized Middle East, which president invaded a sovereign country, overthrew its government, and hoped to install a democracy?  Isn't it true we're seeing the unintended consequences of that decision now?</comment>

<comment>"75% unemployment rate"Uh huh.</comment>

<comment>Rush has an affinity for Trump because they are both performers who value public attention above all else.</comment>

<comment>Hey SJWs.   Listening to Conor lecture on what a conservative is would be like me lecturing you on intersectionality.</comment>

<comment>Says the guy who doesn't know the meaning of words like Fascist, Nazi, reactionary, progressive, left-wing, or douchebag; yet keeps using them.You're calling the kettle black on this one.</comment>

<comment>There seems to be some playing with definitions here. Conor might not consider Trump an ideological conservative but as far as I can tell he embodies ideological conservativism.Also, small correction. GW Bush was a "compassionate conservative". That was his shtick. Trump has merely dropped the qualifier.</comment>

<comment>If you think Trump embodies conservatism, then you need to read George Will or Charles C.W. Cooke.A dose of Edmund Burke would help as well. Compare what you read to the rhetoric of Trump and you will see he is not, in fact, a conservative. Bush was fairly inconsistent, too. It helps to understand those who you disagree with.</comment>

<comment>The man who sets himself the task of singling out the thread of order from the tapestry will by the decision alone have taken charge of the world and it is only by such taking charge that he will effect a way to dictate the terms of his own fate.</comment>

<comment>This article immediately reminded me of a favorite jingle of yesteryear:“Fatty Arbuckle,Sitting on a fence,Trying to make a dollarOut of fifteen cents."</comment>

<comment>"Conservatives" are constantly at war with one another over what it means to be conservative.  There is no authority.  There are just megaphones and whoever has the biggest megaphone usually is the most persuasive.  Rush clearly has the biggest megaphone.  Rush is pro Trump.  In fact, there really is not very much controversy surrounding Trump outside of the DC Media (which Rush is not a member of).  Trump runs the gauntlet with the DC Media "establishment" conservatives.  Not very many out there in the real world consider these pundits and journalists true conservatives.  Famous pundits like George Will and Charles Krauthammer have impeccable conservative credentials and they hate Trump.</comment>

<comment>Well George Will is no conservative, more like a Romney republican and Trump has no kind words for Charles anyway... You need better examples, try using Fox News in the future, most liberals do that anyway...!</comment>

<comment>I disagree.  George Will is a conservative.  What pisses me off are the people like Andrew Sullivan or David Brooks or this author who clearly are not.</comment>

<comment>Why do you think your opinion on who is and isn't a conservative is better than the opinion of those who you name?</comment>

<comment>Your post could not better illustrate the problem with the conservative movement today.  Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Kim Jong Un detonates a hydrogen bomb while the UK debates banning Trump from entering their country...kind of sad really!</comment>

<comment>I guess a sucker is born everyday...</comment>

<comment>We can focus on more than one thing.</comment>

<comment>Trump has said he admires Kim Jong-un.“If you look at North Korea, this guy, he’s like a maniac, OK?” Trump said at a rally in Ottumwa, Iowa, on Saturday.“And you’ve got to give him credit: How many young guys — he was like 26 or 25 when his father died — take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it’s pretty amazing when you think of it. How does he do that?” he added.“Even though it is a culture, and it’s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he’s the boss. It’s incredible.”</comment>

<comment>The current political cabal will not go quietly; they'll exact their revenge by expediting plans to destroy American sovereignty and vilify patriotism with subversion. Current globalist market conditions are a warning to citizenry and to toe the line. We are angry and we will take our country back! They always underestimate a pissed-off citizenry of Republic ideals.</comment>

<comment>"But at some point [Rush] figured out that the Bushes don’t value him for his intellect "Wonder if he'll ever figure out that the Bushes are just a part of a vast majority on that one.</comment>

<comment>When an oligarchy fractures, their servants choose sides. Trump is trying a hostile take over and Rush has tendered his shares.CF can't provide a coherent non personality based analysis because he can't admit that he was doing the same thing as Rush in his support for the failed takeover by the libertarian Rand Paul.</comment>
