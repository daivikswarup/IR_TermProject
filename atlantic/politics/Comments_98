<comment>Fake oldie "Esther Simpson" illustrates the problem the Dems have with Trump. Instead of telling the truth about Trump, they tell lies and smear (something they didn't catch from Trump).The way for Jeb and the Dems to undercut Trump is to realize that he represents real and valid concerns. He's just channeling them into negative avenues and proposing things he can't make happen. For instance, there's no way Trump will be able to deport all illegal aliens. He could promote attrition, but he won't do that. As a result, he's in effect helping Obama continue his immigration agenda.One would think that pointing out to Trump fans that he's in effect helping Obama would be a powerful tool the Dems and Jeb could use, but so far they aren't capable of doing it.[Note: personal attacks from other sockpuppets the dude behind "Esther Simpson" has might follow.]</comment>

<comment>I knew you were coming--your friends are already here.We agree to an extent about Trump, but your characterizations of what "the Dems" think and do miss the mark, and fall into your usual pattern of Codswallop.   There seems to be a consensus that Trump is the Democrat's unwitting ally.  Your claim that Democrats don't see that is contradicted by about 90% of the Democrats posting here.  I posted a couple days ago that if Trump is the nominee, Hillary wins by default.  Doesn't mean anyone likes the guy, though.Trump does not stand a chance of holding any elected office.As for your personal attacks, what's that all about, baby?  You used to tell me that my infinite variety would never cloy. Looking for a younger girl of, say, eleven?  Oh well, you were dysfunctional anyway, and spooning with you was like hugging Jabba the Hutt.  I'll find a man who can attain an erection and be much better off.I don't think any sock puppets are coming.  Unless Deus ex Iguana is on his way.  He's  yours, no?To any readers of this thread:  You should know that 24Dot is NOT a fake.  He really is a Wookie who carries around a dead fish. </comment>

<comment>Esther, I approve of your commenting wholeheartedly. As a Trump supporter and media observer, I can say with 100% certainty that idiotic internet trolls like you help drive up Trump's poll numbers and will propel him to the white house.  Dems still could debate the issues and still have a chance.  That door is closing though.</comment>

<comment>Iggy, sweetie, 24Dot's place in my bed is still warm and you are already hitting on me?Thank you for your sweet message.  I don't think you are a very keen observer though.  I think you are a few pinto beans short of a Taco Salad, frankly.Issues?  Trump?  Mr "Build a Wall"?  You have to be kidding.  The guy has no serious policy positions at all.  NO serious minded person could possibly support Donno the Clown.  His only strength is the same one he exhibited on his TV show--he appeals to the simple-minded.  There are not enough of you.</comment>

<comment>Both "Bcrew" (/disqus_l3bMavjrlg/) and "SacJP" (/disqus_1ORRm00QFr/) are using similar analogies that don't apply.There's no pro-murderer lobby, but there is a huge and powerful pro-illegal alien lobby that includes nearly the entire establishment and leaders of the U.S.: media, banks, business, labor, Dem leaders, most GOP leaders, etc. etc.They simply aren't going to let Trump even try to deport all illegal aliens. The ACLU will form a coalition to sue, first getting a temporary injunction and thus tying it up in the courts for months or years just as they did with AZ and other states. Big Business will buy off Congress and force them to pull Trump's funding. The lobby will punish the few in Congress who support Trump's plan.Thinking that Trump can deport all illegal aliens is, to be very frank, an IQ test. If you think he can do it you perhaps should just help those who can think things through.</comment>

<comment>Bcrew/SacJP: could you two agree on one name? Using sockpuppets makes you look even more like a Moby.Your examples of crimes are almost universally agreed to be bad. Illegal immigration isn't anything like those to most people: you're using deliberately deceptive analogies.Trump fans are dumb and deranged by definition. They only have power at the ballot box, and they're clustered in areas where they don't have much sway. They have no intellectual sway over the U.S. and they don't have much money individually.On the other side, Trump's opponents in his ventures would be the smartest, richest, most powerful people in the U.S. The entire establishment and their helpers (like this site) would be working to undercut Trump 24/7/365. Even if Fox, Breitbart, and Daily Caller were on Trump's side that wouldn't make a bit of difference. Only idiots don't realize that.</comment>

<comment>To win approval on illegals the status quo pleases enough. Why would people support giving others the rope to hang their society with? Only once and... going downhill faster increases.</comment>

<comment>Well, the economy reacted so positively due to the massive influx of wealth that came from confiscating all the possessions of the Jews and killing the owners.Some  people's "luck" is other people's genocide, I guess.  I cannot believe i am talking with an anti-Semite who wants to elect Donald Trump so America can be like Nazi Germany on Christmas Eve.You are a disgusting piece of human filth.  I am not talking to you.But you are a very good example of the kind of low-life hater that supports Trump.</comment>

<comment>You can call Trump a racist misogynist Islamophobe or you can debate him about whether free trade, immigration, and endless war have been good for America. Which do you think the mainstream has chosen to do?</comment>

<comment>Most Americans dislike Trump because he is an anti-American bigot, a fool, and the world's biggest liar.Great question!  </comment>

<comment>He ain't anti-American. And most Americans don't hate him.</comment>

<comment>Polls disagree.  He is the most loathed candidate running.And the biggest liar.  Don't your ears burn?</comment>

<comment>A majority (you know, most) don't 'hate' (a very specific word) him.</comment>

<comment>I will leave you to determine the line between intense dislike, as in " I would not vote for him no matter what," and hate.   Thank you for conceding my point.Trump won't be dog catcher, much less leader of the free world.</comment>

<comment>So, you're a Hillary supporter? If it came down to Hillary vs Trump, what would you do? I think she outright lies every time she speaks. Do you remember when Bill and Hillary left the White House, and she stole silverware , china, and furniture? They made her return some of it, but she kept a lot. What kind of person would do that? </comment>

<comment>You would vote for a thief? Just to see the GOP lose? I don't know what to say! Do you think that Trump is the GOP? They'll tell you he's not. If he gets the nomination, they lose that round anyway. Even worse, they'll have to support him. Wouldn't that be even better?</comment>

<comment>If she outright lies when ever she speaks she will hardly be noticed. If she out right tells the truth she'll be called a liar.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the best candidate hands down. Hillery is a liar and has very questionable character.  Trump is loud and brash but he loves this country and wants to make it great again.</comment>

<comment>Well Ester, since you bring up polls, have you seen Trump's poll numbers? My ears burn whenever any politician speaks. Trump usually exaggerates things more than he lies. As a senior citizen, every four years, I've gotten to vote for or against candidates that were hand picked by two parties controlled by super donors. Aren't you tired of having to vote for someone you don't like over someone you like even less? I hate that. This time it could be completely different, at least for me. If Trump wasn't as brash as he's been, he would have been mowed down by the establishment party people as soon as he began to run. I think he's a good American, and will look out for you and me more than any other candidate. Why is that so wrong? Would it be wrong to have secure borders? To put American interests above outside interests? To let Americans have first choice to be hired? I don't mind brash. It's better than BS. </comment>

<comment>Trump lies all the time. But so does the bipartisan political establishment, FOX News, and the MSM. At least Trump is straight about it.</comment>

<comment>If you can't comprehend the fact that The Donald is a reaction to 15 years of unbroken policy blunders, rampant lying, and sneering imperious condescension on the part of the bipartisan elite of US society, I can't really help you. Half of his appeal is based alone on the fact that he viciously attacks and humiliates them on a daily basis.</comment>

<comment>Income inequality is indeed one of the most prominent blunders I'm referring to, but I don't think Trump himself was inevitable solely because of it in tandem with demographics. Much of South America has far worse income inequality and changing demographics, but there are no Trump(s) yet, in part because they (!) actually have a more responsible center-left and especially center-right since the new millenium. It took a toxic cocktail of factors-overlooked ones including center-right political developments and a general malaise in Western culture-to bring him and people like him to the forefront.As I've mentioned before, our political establishment has such a stunning record of incompetence over the past 15 years(other nations have had coups for far less) that it's a wonder that it has taken this long for a Trump figure to emerge. In addition to income inequality and profiting over a near economic collapse, they've also managed to turn Russia into an enemy again and collapse multiple states into anarchy, among so many other things. Yet they still rule, often not by debate but by occupying the perch. Trump visibly scares and annoys them, which arguably is a more important source of his appeal than the man himself.Trump is not the solution to this. He'd be an absolutely terrible President. But the spanking is long overdue, and if something isn't done now, especially in terms of center-right politics, we'll have someone far more competent-and worse-in 2020.</comment>

<comment>And people who think the reaction to incompetent government is to pick the biggest lying moron they can find deserve to be mockedSorry there's no nice way to say that</comment>

<comment>Trump is best understood, insofar as his supporters are concerned, as the ultimate troll. You'd be surprised how many Trumpistas are frank about this in private over a couple of beers.And of course, because our political system is set up so that it takes a billionaire (and a celebrity) to do this...</comment>

<comment>It is very easy to sit here and take shots at a candidate and not come out in support of one.  You won't actually say which other loser you are for.</comment>

<comment>I have a weird mix of left wing and right wing positions. However, this isn't really about ideology: it's about competence. I can respect someone whose ideology might not totally align with mine (Joe Biden, Paul Ryan), but who I think understands power.Socioeconomics/abortion/gay rights/education: Sanders. Probably to the left of him in some ways, although I have an intense fetish for tech/science startups, and I have very little use for the cultural Bolshevik types, in part by virtue of my background. Wonder what Bernie thinks of the Internet and it's possible role in education?Illegal Immigration: Rubio/Kasich on preexisting non-criminal illegal immigrants. Deporting 11 million people is the right wing version of getting rid of 300 million guns, it's not happening, both for moral and pragmatic reasons. Trump on further illegal immigration. National sovereignty does mean something, believe it or not. Sanders was OK on this until he started pandering to the social leftists.State order/antipathy toward PC culture and bien-pensants: Trump. But I also want an end to the the War on Drugs and a focus on employment in the ghetto. Tough on crime, but tough on the causes of crime.Foreign policy: I'm sorry, but I simply do not see anyone I trust with foreign policy in the 2016 race, although some candidates are less worse in certain parts of the world. Half of the GOP Establishment wants to blow up the world-I wouldn't trust Christie with a butter knife, let alone a nuclear bomb. Guys like Adelson are why I really question whether Trump is the truly insane one, at least on this subject.But Hillary is likely a continuation of the utterly bankrupt Obama Administration. I'm extremely turned off by the idea of feminism and gay rights becoming increasing components of our foreign policy. She would likely be better with Assad, but this is more than offset by China-she is to them what Obama is to Putin in terms of likely personal chemistry. Trump is just too stupid to take seriously, and somehow, I don't see Bernie dealing successfully with guys like Putin.My overall pick would be for George Herbert Walker Bush or one of the guys who served coming out of retirement to somehow ease the bleeding, especially in the Middle East. </comment>

<comment>Have you read Fukuyama's latest book "Origins of political order"?  It is a masterpiece.   I think you also should read Adios Amigo, which Frum summarized so I am sure you get the gist.  I don't understand you at all..  We cannot let 30 million illegal aliens get the vote.  it will beget more amnesties, and the country will be ruined.  We need all-star immigrants who add something.  We do not need hordes of illiterate uskilled people to come here and go on welfare.</comment>

<comment>This is my second reply.  I see you have added a lot more text.  I am really just POed about the way they cover Trump here.   A lot of what they say about Trump is true, of course.  I have written many times he needs to clean up his act.  I think Frum just summed up exactly how I feel in a blog just out today, I am sure you saw it.  I have also noticed that you have noticed a lot of the things I mean by unfair coverage of Trump.</comment>

<comment>Indeed. And in the end, no matter how out of line he can be, he is a way to piss off the people who have caused nothing but grief, yet still demand we kiss their asses. I think this article is good:http://www.theamericanconserva...</comment>

<comment>If the NWO global cartel is for Hillery and Jeb and against Trump, I'm for Trump. It's a no brainer. WE have had them choose our presidents for decades and see where we are.</comment>

<comment>Russia becoming an enemy again is all Putin's fault. He never cared about being an ally. The US's mistake was thinking that since Russia was a new democracy, its increasing authoritarianism was simply part of the process of becoming more of a democracy and not just Putin taking over all of Russia's civil society.</comment>

<comment>1) Why did Putin come to power in the first place?2) That's not true. I don't think Putin was ever going to be an "ally" in the sense that NATO wanted-and I think a mistake was thinking that the fall of Communism meant that Russians suddenly stopped acting like Russians and would become "normal" Europeans at a slower pace-but having a Cold War 2.0 with him was not in the slightest preordained. His policies until the Color Revolutions were ambiguous at worst toward the West, and the FSB and CIA were able to cooperate in operations in the early stages of the War on Terror in a way that would be unthinkable today. Putin might be an evil SOB, but this doesn't change the fact that our Russian policy over the last 15-20 years has largely been one continuous failure, with brief exceptions.</comment>

<comment>We never had a Russia policy amigo, Russia isn't important enough. It never was. That is why we're so reactionary to Russia.Putin came to power through basically being in the right place at the right time where even Stalin's rotting corpse could taken over after Yeltsin and been seen as a positive.</comment>

<comment>Yeah... loads of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons with a ramshackle state bureaucracy. An international criminal element entrenched in the highest levels of government ever since the later Brezhnev days. A regime completely dominated by former or active duty intel/security officers from the most amoral secret police tradition on Earth, one that is a complete culture within itself and is dedicated now to remaking the European and Middle East geopolitical consensus in total. I could go on for paragraphs on end...Not important at all.</comment>

<comment>Russia has many powerful things and aspects. They're a nuclear superpower, I do not disagree. But tell me, how are they a threat or important?Crumbling infrastructure, no rule of law, aging population, dying economy that is curtailing military spending, massive brain drain, shrinking wages with growing income equality. This is not a threatening country outside of bombs. Even their conventional military is overrated on paper, Germany could most likely beat them in a fair fight. We've already beat them in their backyard and Russia's influence in Africa and Latin America pales in comparison to the US's and China's.They have few allies and many of their ties are built on mutual distrust of the West rather than any real love or cohesive strategy. Take Russia and China for example or Russia and Iran.You're giving them far too much credit amigo. Russia always underestimates the long term game. Russia is still an outlier in Europe despite them funding political parties and how are they changing the geopolitical consensus in the Middle East. All they want is to be a respected "great power", it is all Russia operates under. Russia getting a seat at the Syrian table is a win for them, despite this and increased ties with Israel, they haven't gotten anything. They've lost Turkey as an ally for example.</comment>

<comment>For the foreseeable future Russia is Europe's gas station though.they decide to turn off the pipelines Europe freezes.of course they won't because their oil industry is the only actual profitable sector of the Russian economy.</comment>

<comment>Actually, under Putin's rule, there's some evidence that Russia has turned the corner with demographics. It's far from over, but it's nowhere near as bleak as it once was. As for the infrastructure and economy, never underestimate the capacity of a Russian to endure.That's true. The Kremlin is the weakling conventionally, which is the sad part. But they clearly think the West is too feeble and mired in affluenza to do anything serious to them (sanctions simply encourage more aggression), and we aren't willing to do what it takes to dissuade them of this. Putin can never succeed in his long term goals, but that doesn't mean he can't cause enormous damage on the way.Since when was love necessary in real life? Again-Putin overestimates his reach. He does not overestimate the strong alienation toward the West and the desire for a Westphalian foreign policy consensus in these corners.Think long term in Europe if the situation degenerates more, especially given the tendency of Russian intelligence to create problems in order to solve them. And I'd say in the ME, Russia's goal of becoming the main arbiter in much of the region is proceeding splendidly.But Turkey never was an ally to begin with. Just the opposite.</comment>

<comment>Answering your 1) , Yeltsin was looking for a sucessor, who promised to look the other way for his years of crazy corruption. Several refused, and finally one day one  guy said "alright, i won't come after you" . That's how Putin got the job.</comment>

<comment>Well, yes. But Putin was also helped into power by the intense (and justified) feelings of anger and shame in Russia during the 90s. Helped by the fact that the Chekists, as usual, planned in advance.</comment>

<comment>Yes, you're right. The KGB saw itself as "Mother Russia" last line of defense. And Putin is pure KGB. What set him off was the US breaking the promise not to extend NATO past Poland, and adding insult to injury, recognizing Kosovo. He warned , "there are many Kosovo's out there", we thought he could be dismissed, and then came the Georgia War. Now Kosovo is a quagmire of a country, and Putin converted from cold partner to bitter adversary. The EU tried a "Soft Power" move on Ukraine, suceeded in flipping it, forcing him, to a desperate move to salvage "something". And since Europe is moving away from carbon energy, Putin will no longer have any leverage over us.</comment>

<comment>>but there are no Trump(s) yetLula, Chavez, Correa, Morales?</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should withdraw Lula da Silva. Came from the grassroots Unions, lost a boatload of elections, did his two terms and bowed out. And never, ever, said anything like Chavez or Morales said on a daily basis.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I thought he didn't really fit, but he was still demonized as a dangerous rabble-rousing populist, at least in the papers I read at the time. They didn't send anyone important to the inauguration, remember. I suppose that was just after Argentina's default, though.</comment>

<comment>Populist, yes, sure. But not a demagogue. Chavez daydreamed about Simon Bolivar. Lula's slogan was "Zero Famin". Not at all the same tone. And Brazil actually enjoyed a boom in Lula's terms. Uruguay is trying to replicate his MO, through Trade Unions vs Corporations. And it's working for them.</comment>

<comment>I don't think any of them are quite comparable to Trump in what they could potentially inspire years down the road. Part of this isn't Trump, it's the overall political culture, but still.</comment>

<comment>"At least Trump is straight about it."What does that mean?  Straight about lying.  Seriously.  That's not an argument.</comment>

<comment>Happy Holidays Terri! You're one of the most interesting people on this board. One day after you've retired and aren't drug tested, come blaze with me!</comment>

<comment>I'd love to, Sarge.  Happy Holidays to you and yours.</comment>

<comment>Terri, what do you want for the holidays?</comment>

<comment>A tablet.  I've never had one.  I like to read.  I think it would be convenient to not have to carry books around.  Also, a "multi-cooker" - it's a pressure cooker, slow cooker and a rice cooker all in one.  I like to cook but don't have a lot of time.  I think it will be fun.</comment>

<comment>Kindles are pretty cheap these days.  Or get a couple generation behind iPad they can be had pretty cheap too :)</comment>

<comment>Thanks.  I've resisted getting one.  Didn't want another expensive gadget to worry about on top of a phone, desk computer, lap top - but I think it's time.</comment>

<comment>I was against getting a tablet/kindle for the same reasons until I got one as a gift and was pleasantly surprised how convenient and generally good they are. Especially when traveling or commuting on public transit. Pretty cool to fit a huge book/magazine into your pocket or small bag/purse instead of lugging it around. I suggest giving it a try. You never know.</comment>

<comment>Are you still stalking women like Korea_Kat around the Internet, Max?</comment>

<comment>Get a tablet, I used to think they were a redundant technology but I see all my kids using them and decided to buy one. Now I'm hooked and on the couch with them with our tablets. Its the 2015 family time.</comment>

<comment>"A new study... found that readers using a Kindle were "significantly" worse than paperback readers at recalling when events occurred in a mystery story."</comment>

<comment>Mmmm.  I'm still thinking it's worth it to not have to lug books on to planes along with my lap top when a travel on business.</comment>

<comment>That's fair.</comment>

<comment>Oh goody.  Two losers on an off topic discussion.</comment>

<comment>Your jealousy is unbecoming.</comment>

<comment>You cannot guilt trip me.  You harass people who merely support the frontrunner of one of our two parties. You are a hater.</comment>

<comment>A clearer case of projection would be hard to find.  I still remember the thread a few months ago where you responded to every "criticism" of Fiorina, like HP's stock performance under her tenure, with a blanket accusation of sexism.  Go buy some self-awareness.</comment>

<comment>I absolutely stand by each one of those comments.  I was mostly kidding with you.</comment>

<comment>Here's what it means: Trumpismo is better thought of as a cult rather than a political campaign or even a coherent ideology. In my experience, such things are considered as relatively honest compared to anything considered "establishment" in part because of the openness surrounding it, as part of the appeal. You know what you are getting into, he doesn't lie while taking being visibly condescending to you or while trying to insult your intelligence, and the Donald blatantly blurts out whatever he is thinking. It's an obvious lie sometimes, but if you are part of the cult, you don't care or excuse it.Put basically, he doesn't try to sneak in the lie or go for nuances like most politicians do. He just jaw-droppingly states what he thinks, or at least he is perceived to be among Trump sympathizers.</comment>

<comment>and this is a good thing how?</comment>

<comment>You are confusing my willingness to give a dispassionate analysis on why Trump is supported-beyond the typical cliches that are convenient but don't get to the heart of the matter-for me thinking that this is a *good* thing.</comment>

<comment>Well saying he's just the same as other politicians and the MSM sounds like you're excusing himhe's much much worse</comment>

<comment>The question is not which is objectively "worse", it's the manner in how they lie and why it is effective. Trump's lies are often more outrageous. That's true-and completely irrelevant.If Trumpism is to be stopped-and if it's not, Trump might burn out, but we'll see something worse later on-it must be understood correctly.</comment>

<comment>"Trumpism", if there is such a thing, means enforcing EXISTING immigration laws and building a fence, something that congress already agreed to do in the past.</comment>

<comment>Maybe he'd have more credibility if he started on his own work sites? They're full of illegal immigrants. The man is trolling you.</comment>

<comment>Money trumps principals. If your competition outsources labor to cheap sources you might not be able to compete by taking the time to make sure principals are followed, realism.</comment>

<comment>People have been saying "we'll see something worse later" for decades and decades, but nothing of the sort actually ever happens. Mainly because they don't understand Americans, trends, and history. Americans aren't and never were extremists.Sure, it may pop up from time to time, but it almost always fizzles out and amounts to nothing. I don't see anything in the future that will change this. Especially since Americans continue to trend towards moderates/liberals.</comment>

<comment>It has been awhile since we've had a troll fest like this one.   Do you all get on the phone?  Where is your leader Bradan?</comment>

<comment>A Bradan comparison?!? DRINK!</comment>

<comment>You are worse.  We'll get you banned.</comment>

<comment>"We"?  You have not had an up vote in weeks.  Now that you are "schlonging" people with your little lizard penis, even the other tea party whack-jobs have abandoned you.You are all alone.  Just like in real life.</comment>

<comment>No society on Earth is invulnerable to extremism. Some are more susceptible to it than others, but there's no such thing as a society where it can't happen, not while human beings are human beings. To think it can't happen helps rather than hurts extremism.We'll see. I hope you are right.</comment>

<comment>Except that's not what I'm saying or arguing. Just saying that "it can happen anywhere" doesn't make it so. The conditions have to be ripe for it, and there has to be precedent. Neither of which exist now, or even in the past when things were actually worst as far as the economic, social, and political climate.</comment>

<comment>And that's where we disagree. I think that in the long term, if conditions progress from where they are now, they will be. We are clearly on the verge of some very new trends in Western culture. It'll be interesting to see how they pan out.</comment>

<comment>Here you go exaggerating "conditions" again. What "conditions?" If it didn't happen when things were far worse i.e: 1930s-40s and 60s-80s, why would it happen now when society is far more stable, wealthier, secure, and the trend is towards the center and left? Because you and Trump say so?</comment>

<comment>Because, fundamentally, our political class is weaker and more decadent, for all their credentials and impressive talk. These people would never be able to handle the Depression without the country sinking into dictatorship, or 1968 without the people seeking a Gaullist man on horseback.</comment>

<comment>That's a bizarre bias of an opinion you have there. What makes you think that? Because our political class is actually better organized, stronger, and far less corrupt than in anytime in our history.</comment>

<comment>Terri is a known hater that would have this board closed to all but far left trolls like her.  It seems she has been banned too, since she is on a new account.</comment>

<comment>There's nothing "straight" about blatantly lying.  It's a ridiculous way to look at it.  It's politics, too.  He's pandering.</comment>

<comment>You think so. But not everybody does.</comment>

<comment>He "lies" far less than the average pol, if you call his gaffes lies.  He is unscripted, and makes gaffes.  That is true.  He exaggerates, that is true.  Hillary and PAC-owned pols simply tell outright, premeditated, and scripted lies.</comment>

<comment>No they're lies and are totally calculated ones at that.</comment>

<comment>This has to be the stupidest thing I have ever read.</comment>

<comment>Why?</comment>

<comment>No he does not.  You won't back this up.  No one here ever backs this up.</comment>

<comment>I've backed it up many timesyou've even admitted he lies but said you don't care</comment>

<comment>You are lying.</comment>

<comment>Still waiting to see those thousands of Muslims in Jersey city cheering</comment>

<comment>He just won the Lie of the Year Award. Educate yourself. http://www.politifact.com/trut...</comment>

<comment>"I think he's a good American, and will look out for you and me more than any other candidate."I'm curious as to upon what you'd base that conclusion.  There is nothing in Trump's biography that shows he has ever done anything like that before.  In fact, all evidence seems to support exactly the opposite proposition.Was it something he said?  Just the way he said it?  Most of your post implies that you find all politicians to be liars, what is it that makes you think Trump isn't also?  After all, up until this year, Donald was just another of the "super doners" you say you're striking out against.</comment>

<comment>It's almost everything that he has said that makes me believe him, more than the OWNED others. He employs thousands, and the majority of them like him. He will secure the borders better than any other. He won't make stupid deals like Ryan just did on the omnibus. He says he will take better care of Veterans, I'm a disabled Vietnam Vet, so that matters to me. I have never voted for a candidate to do anything for me before, but this one time I will.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, I still do not wish to engage you.  You are too revolting.</comment>

<comment>You don't talk to trolls but you certainly are one.  Every Trump article there is Esther with the exact same Trump troll.</comment>

<comment>How is Trump going to secure our borders when he's busy making money off having illegal immigrants on his work sites? He's a billionaire Ivy League New Yorker, not your average Joe. He's trolling you!</comment>

<comment>And yet he's apparently more in touch with the concerns and anxieties of middle America than anyone except maybe the crotchety wannabe socialist. Doesn't say much for the political class, does it, that someone like Trump is so much closer to the average Joe than the best they can muster.</comment>

<comment>She's probably a paid troll. Plenty of them are out there working to help campaigns. Who knows?</comment>

<comment>Yes!  I am working for the Sanity campaign.My pay is self-respect.</comment>

<comment>I would rather listen to the bs from Trump, than the propaganda from MSNBC & CNN. He's over the top, but I don't care. I'll vote fro anyone except HRC and Bush3.</comment>

<comment>Trump 2016! Trump is the only candidate with a majority of the electorates support. Right now he has 30,000 people showing up at his rallies and they are having to turn thousands away. No one including Hillery or Jeb have that.  Trump is smart, a graduate of Wharton Business, and he was in a military academy in his youth. He loves our country. A vote for some else is a vote for the global cartel who have no interest in bettering your life or promoting what is good for this nation.</comment>

<comment>So, that is an admission that he is a bigot, a fool and a liar, right?</comment>

<comment>Americans are hungry and hungry people are not picky. It is obvious many are desperate and, hesitantly, Trump becomes the person who at least stands for many.</comment>

<comment>The fact that you see nothing wrong with your reply is precisely why Trump continues to gain support."You're racist."  Is not an argument against people who say we shouldn't be continuing to allow massive amounts of mexicans into the US.If you love brown people so much, there are plenty of countries you can move to in order to be around them.  There is no need to turn the US into Brazil.</comment>

<comment>they dont get it , all they have is for 70 years is "nazi and racist." no one cares anymore, it's not like conservatives can change and liberals will stop with the name calling. so why even bother, embrace the insults it will make you stronger</comment>

<comment>Most Americans do not hate Trump. In fact, most liberals love him....</comment>

<comment>Planet Earth bids you welcome, stranger.</comment>

<comment>Do you hate Trump?</comment>

<comment>Hate is a strong word.  I've disliked him since I met him in New York City and he hit on me.  Freaking married geriatric wearing a dead squirrel on his head hit on me.  Not presidential timber.I hate his politics. and I hate his hair, and I would sooner eat worms than vote for him.  But do I hate him? Probably stop at a strong dislike.</comment>

<comment>Yup. Many people hate his politics. Many of those same people see him as unelectable, due to his ridiculousness and believe that he has hijacked the adversary's party. Therefore, many of those people love him. The enemy of my enemy is a friend sort of thing.</comment>

<comment>I don't know where you get, "therefore they love him."  I don't see that anywhere in my circles.  The guy is a jerk.</comment>

<comment>Just like hate is a strong word, love perhaps is as well. I "very much like" seeing a buffoon like Trump hijack the republican party, which I didn't think could get much worse before Trump. I was wrong.</comment>

<comment>Public school product?I can tell by the drool.</comment>

<comment>Troll product?  I can tell by the total lack of manners.</comment>

<comment>I dunno I'm an engineer, a veteran (was in Army Aviation, I'm a tech Executive amd I used to be a college professor...I am having Guly educated akd I support Trump. True story earlier this week in SF California I was sitting across from a very well educated black man who is EXTREMELY liberal but who was developing code for our cloud services... and then out of the blue he brought up politics. I never discuss politics at work no one knows mine because I explicitly tell people it's a 3rd rail. He didn't listen to me he just started a missive about how great a President Trump would be and how the country needs him. I tried again to change the subject. But he just kept singing Trump's praises. I was shocked. I think we are looking at a political Tsunami. Trump quite likely will win 50 States.</comment>

<comment>You appear to be a grown man pretending to be Ronald Reagan. Not credible.  Sorry.</comment>

<comment>This is exactly why you're losing...you deny reality right in front of your face. Nevertheless....Riddle me this...if I'm wrong1) what's Trumps ceiling? 2) why has every pundit been wrong on his rise and his strength which even you'll concede is growing.3) why is he able to consistently draw the largest most energized crowds wherever he goes filling stadiums and the largest  venues at every location?4) why are polling showing him with surprising strength with whites blacks and Hispanics?5) why has each and every media and political attack on him failed so spectacularly that they backfired?6) is he wrong about the other candidates being puppets to deep pocket donors?7) why did his support increase after he proposed a temporary Muslim visa ban?Can't wait to hear...</comment>

<comment>I do not talk to liars or trolls and you are both.  Go away.</comment>

<comment>Nope you people refuse to discuss facts. Trump is winning and your being in denial changes nothing.</comment>

<comment>I have a people?  The only "fact" I see is that you seem to be blowing a lot of hot air.It's your fairy tale.  Tell it how ever you want.  But not to me.  You are a sicko.</comment>

<comment>You're a demographic. An angry easily manipulated lefty one. Everything you disagree with you deny the validity of. Don't say later I didn't try to tell you.</comment>

<comment>How many times do I have to tell you I don't want you to talk to me?  Go away.  You are a grown man pretending to be Ronald Reagan, pestering a teenage girl.You are the very definition of a creep.</comment>

<comment>You are right, Anita.  I checked out his other posts before he set his profile to "private" earlier tonight.  He is a creep and a stalker, and a pervert.Surely not what he claims to be.</comment>

<comment>And now I see earlier in this thread where you admit to being a pedophile.You are horrible!  Never, ever, write me again.  Trump is a pedophile too.  He even said he wanted to hit on his own daughter.You creeps should go form your own country.</comment>

<comment>Huh...? You child milestone pervert. Your lies brand you as evil and delusional.</comment>

<comment>I have heard a couple of people (who should call him racist or something derogatory) say he speaks for many; I don't know if they'd vote for him but -based on phenotype- they should have been against him and I don't talk politics much, being crucified is not my goal.</comment>

<comment>That would require some coherence on Trump's part.</comment>

<comment>Bonegirl06! Happy Holidays bae! I hope you and your man have a good one, you're one of my favorite people! What did you get me? I got you a crock pot that is to die for!</comment>

<comment>Thanks, I need a new one, especially for when I make my possum stew.  I sent you some of the shine I made in my backyard still.  Hope that's ok?  Happy Holidays!</comment>

<comment>OMG, Bonegirl, I feel like an ass, I'm so sorry for shitty jokes! I was being serious, you're one of my favorite people!</comment>

<comment>Lol I was just messing with you!  I don't care.  I do kind of live in a redneck area, I won't lie.  And I do really need a crockpot.  Honestly, I hope you and your family have a good holiday.</comment>

<comment>Except he doesn't debate.  He serves up red-meat statements with a layer of baseles-but-somehow-confidence-inspiring superlatives.  His policy positions are an inch deep.  It's one thing to agree with his sentiment, it's another to think he has a plan or a prayer of implementing anything to achieve it.</comment>

<comment>Lawyers debate but have no principles and turn their back on you once trial is over.</comment>

<comment>Exactly</comment>

<comment>I am just amazed that the homophobic set doesn't realize that Trump protests his masculinity like he is afraid it will be questioned.</comment>

<comment>Of course they're about style, Libtard. Donald is all about style, who wants a schlub for a president? Look, you pansies can't have it both ways - you want style or substance? You want a schlong or you want to be a pussy? You want to get sh!t done or you want to "debate" it to death? When Trump is president, we're going to put glitter on the nukes we rain down on our enemies. We're going to adorn the Internet plugs with bacon to annoy ISIS. We're going to gold plate the bullets with which we shoot journalists and our political opponents. Our generals will have gold and silver on their uniforms, because that is what winners wear. We will hide our poor behind our new cities of splendor, because who wants to look at losers. The wall Mexico is going to build will have a gate to rival the one in Brandenburg and it will welcome the 11million Mexicans we force to walk a modern Trail of Tears back into Mexico (please leave all possessions behind.)Winners have style. Losers talk about substance. Do you want America to be great? Then get dressed for dinner.</comment>

<comment>Winners don't say "schlong" or "libtard."That is strictly loser-speak.</comment>

<comment>"Hands up, Don't shoot!"</comment>

<comment>Hillary supported Iraq War, Trump opposed it.  Hillary lies on live national TV about Trump being in ISIS video but in fact it is her husband Bill in the video.  Hillary lies when she says she believes all rape accusations because she did not believe Juanita Broaddrick's.</comment>

<comment>Trump opposed the Iraq War only after the fact, never before.</comment>

<comment>False.  You guys lie, not Trump.  Americans see this, and his support grows.</comment>

<comment>he started opposing it in 2004He's make baseless claims the Bush WH tried to silence him before then that's all</comment>

<comment>CNN reports, “Among those Republicans who say they watched, 33% say Trump did the best job in the debate, 28% Cruz, 13% Rubio. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie follows with 6%. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, widely seen as needing a strong debate performance to boost his standing in the polls, was rated best by just 1% of debate watchers.”</comment>

<comment>deflect when you're caught telling a lie</comment>

<comment>You are right, I lied, you really do have a penis.</comment>

<comment>You are not a winner. You are a disgusting loser. Go pee in the girls room with the other pussies.</comment>

<comment>You sound like Trump.  Kudos.</comment>

<comment>He needs to do something about his neckties, though. They're really bad.</comment>

<comment>I want to be a schlong... I don't want to be a puzzy... Trump 2016!! Let us make it happen folks!</comment>

<comment>There are numerous places where you can get great reality based coverage of Trump, besides just hearing his message.  Beinart is not a journalist.  He takes Black Lives Matter seriously and thinks America is buying this terrorist group's blatant lies.  Americans love their police and the only problem they believe we have with police is that there are not enough of them.  Law abiding poor blacks are desperate for police protection.  Beinart's proposals will deny them this and thus we have 440 murders this year in Chicago alone along with 2800 shootings.  If you think this is liberalism then you are a racist.  This is racism, not liberalism.  </comment>

<comment>"Police brutality" is not even an actual existing thing -- it is something concocted by racialists.  It is a pack of lies.  Its effect is unquestionably racist.</comment>

<comment>Don't give me more of your pathetic lies.  You leftists are the ones causing the deaths of 1000s of blacks each year.  Blood is on your hands.</comment>

<comment>Oh, Iggy, you can't even be a decent troll.</comment>

<comment>440 murdered 2800 shot and leftists have nothing but blood on their hands.  As bad as the Nazis.</comment>

<comment>Godwin!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, like progs don't ever do that.  :-)</comment>

<comment>"'Police brutality' is not even an actual existing thing"Even trolling, that's a stupid, patently false statement.  All authority is susceptible to abuse.  There have been far too many convictions to even begin to argue from your premise.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>But, how many hate both?  I'm guessing that those that do have issues that are not based in politics.  And, might include those that pretty much hate everything.</comment>

<comment>Beinart is a partisan idiot. Jeb Bush and the rest of the GOP Establishment have been denouncing The Donald like a child molester from day #1, and rationally so considering that, in the final analysis, they are likely to lose the most politically from him. Trump, after all, is first and foremost a reaction to their neglect of the white working class. This was back when he was widely dismissed as a joke among Democrats and their supporters, by contrast. They aren't exactly shy about how much they loathe him. Kasich has compared Trump to Adolf Hitler, for Chrissakes! It doesn't get less subtle than that.Beinart just seems to be angry that they aren't 1) wasting their time on Twitter 24/7 to hover over every stupid thing Trump says, 2) beating their breasts and signaling their virtue by attacking him *correctly*, and 3) defending Hillary Clinton before themselves, being Republican politicians that will be facing off against her next year. </comment>

<comment>All the candidates who attacked Trump went in the tank right after that.  </comment>

<comment>The Donald is like a force of nature-any two bit Republican candidate who attacks him head on seems to fall into the abyss. Walker and Perry have fallen, Bush is kept on life support due to money and inertia, Christie, Kasich and Fiorina are lying on the battlefield bleeding their guts out, and Carson is going down in flames. Only the Cubans remain, and that's because they've been smart enough not to get pulled into the vortex, whether by Rubio's distance or Cruz's triangulation.</comment>

<comment>If the attacks had any substance and were not just pussy whining then they might work.  Jeb attacks and insults Trump and then Trump punches back like a good American, then Jeb whimpers and whines and says "you cannot insult your way to the white house."   Grow a schlong Jebbie. America will never elect a pussy.  Hillary has more balls than Jeb.</comment>

<comment>She does indeed. Mind, she did long before Trump hit the scene, but still.</comment>

<comment>A tribute to the stupidity of the Republican primary voter rather than an endorsement of Trump</comment>

<comment>What happened to your schlong?</comment>

<comment>From here, it looks like the majority of Trump supporters are from the same demographic that deserted the Democratic Party in wake of success of civil rights legislation in the mid-sixties. They seem to be more natural Democrats than Republicans. The GOP has done a fine job hanging on to them by paying lip service to pro life,pro gun and evangelical rhetoric while doing nothing to help them. I can understand the appeal of Trump as neither party has even bothered to listen to their legitimate complaint for years. The elite of both parties better get the message soon. This is getting dangerous.</comment>

<comment>Grow a schlong, Jebbie. Even Hillary Clinton has more balls than you.</comment>

<comment>Literally the next day after Trump uses the word you put it in all your postsare you a Trump puppet or something?</comment>

<comment>Grow a schlong.</comment>

<comment>LOL. The iguana has a hemipenis, literally half a penis and is talking about growing a schlong. This statement is 10x funnier after learning that Snapple fact.</comment>

<comment>You are the least funny commenter.  You try hard to be funny and it always fails.</comment>

<comment>says the man who's said schlong 14 times in like 20 minutes</comment>

<comment>All men have a penis.  This is a biological fact of life.</comment>

<comment>Have you gone totally stupid</comment>

<comment>lol. What do you mean, "gone?"</comment>

<comment>Grow one, oh shlong-less one.</comment>

<comment>Why you so interested in everyone else's penis, my dude?</comment>

<comment>I feel bad for you that being a man you lack a penis.</comment>

<comment>Prolly because the Iguana thinks that having one will make him a real boy.</comment>

<comment>I'll tell you free for nothing having one makes a lot easier to pee quickly.</comment>

<comment>Don't mind him... He is a GENDER NEUTRAL phag</comment>

<comment>He was at least attenuating rational discussion a few weeks ago.  It's slowly been degrading into total trollism</comment>

<comment>Very true...</comment>

<comment>Hemipenes also have burrs on them to keep them from coming dislodged. Which is...something, I guess.</comment>

<comment>Why do you change IDs so often? Did you get banned again?</comment>

<comment>I've never been banned, which is easy to determine give my post count combined with infrequent posting, so I guess we can add disqus to the list of things you don't understand. I change IDs out of whimsy.</comment>

<comment>First of all Barbara Bush was right no more Bush's. Now Jeb is in the race he is so boring and ineffective no wonder he lacks support. As for going after Trump he needn't bother as those who support Trump will never leave his side no matter how Jeb tries to punch him albeit with soft woolly gloves it just won't work. Trump supporters love the fact that he is crude, offensive and his so called solutions on things like building a wall is just simplistic nonsense! His supporters aren't thinking of the country and what Trump would do to make it better because in reality he hasn't got a clue himself how he could make it better as words are cheap on the campaign trail. His supporters love his bluster and name calling of others which is not endearing to the general population but they just love it. Kind of sad when you think about it!!</comment>

<comment>Does Trump have any actual policy advisors? Or is he just winging it on everything? Looks like the latter to me.</comment>

<comment>He is winging it. He has no clue what is involved in running the country. He thinks it is a business. Simplistic nonsense is what passes for serious solutions from Trump.</comment>

<comment>In a political race about schlongs, I'm not surprised the dude named Bush isn't going to punch so well. *Wink *Wink *Nudge *Nudge Vagina!</comment>

<comment>Ah - they all have to settle for going in after the black guy.</comment>

<comment>It's worse than that...he's a pussy named Bush.</comment>

<comment>Could be worse...he could be the Detroit offensive coordinator.</comment>

<comment>What are you trying to say? That dicks "trump" "Bush"?</comment>

<comment>Its been pretty great watching all the Trump supporters on here slowly transform into complete trollsDeus for example a week or two ago was actually debating things.  Now he just answers SCHLONG to everything.</comment>

<comment>It's certainly an interesting preoccupation.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump has coarsened America's non-elite uneducated working/unemployed class.  They now think hate speech is OK.  He's moved the country backward.But the backlash is coming.You are right about Iggy.  He used to just be kind of clueless.  Now he is a rabid potty-mouth fool.I am seeing this coarsening in my everyday life too.  In a way it is good, because it lets you spot the idiots faster, but in the long run it is terrible.  Trump is no American.</comment>

<comment>I am highly educated and I make high six figures... Guess what, I am a rock solid Trump supporter. Trump is a like a breath of fresh air</comment>

<comment>Guess what?  I do not believe you.  But you should know that I am the Sultan of Qatar.Merry Christmas.  Now say something really stupid, like "Clinton is a Marxist."  That will surely convince everyone of your high educational attainment.</comment>

<comment>You can believe whatever you want. Luckily for you this is a free country and not the Marxist "paradise" Sanders and Clintons want to make it</comment>

<comment>Thank you.  That is better than I ever could have wished for.</comment>

<comment>Merry Christmas btw!!</comment>

<comment>Deus, comment?</comment>

<comment>They were already trolls pre-Trump. The Don just pushed them over the edge.</comment>

<comment>I'll admit to being pretty confused as to why Trump has caused deus to get curious about other men's penises, though. Seems like there would be a disconnect there.</comment>

<comment>I'm entirely sure that Deus is Trump at this point.</comment>

<comment>Good phrase. When somebody is "pushed over the edge" it means they've lost control over their emotions, which manifests as extreme anger.We've all been there, we know what it's like communicating with somebody who is in that state of mind. Eventually you learn there is no reasoning through, you must walk away. For your own sanity.</comment>

<comment>This is part of my "no-reply to trolls" policy what I try to tell people as far as dealing with them.</comment>

<comment>Funny, I never even read your comments to begin with.  I only responded to you because you harass people constantly. You whine and moan endlessly about anyone who is moderate or conservative.   The idea you think I am bothered by the fact you do not reply to me is humorous.  You are the worst, most detestable person here.   You stalk women like Korea_Kat and Sarah L around the web.  You make Bradan look like a nice guy.   Bradan I will admit knows a lot of history.  I have to give him credit for being a rain-man like idiot savant. You, OTOH, you are just a loser and a thug and you cannot write for sh*t.</comment>

<comment>Read my reply to Max below in case you missed it.  He is a stalker of women, yet you pal with him.  Why is this?</comment>

<comment>SCHLONG this!! Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Trump 2016! Obama is the most hated president ever.The Don will be the most successful and productive.</comment>

<comment>You mean most hated by the KKK, you,  and other white supremacists.  Fancy that.History will mark Obama's presidency highly.And Trump will never hold elected office.Go back to your trailer and drink Four Roses.</comment>

<comment>The rest of the civilized world already thinks very highly of President Obama.</comment>

<comment>You need some rest granny. Is there a nurse to help you with your  incontinence Because your spewing @&&" from your mouth.  You need Jesus in your late life to repent for what you and your generation has done to this country. Shame on you.God bless America,Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Tee hee!  Your candidate is a racist idiot!  So silly!</comment>

<comment>Dear Trump haters.  Men have penises.  AKA, "schlongs".  It is a biological fact.</comment>

<comment>Schlonged is not a word and you will not find it in any Yiddish text.Just because a few m0r0ns used it over decades does not make it proper Yiddish.There is a term that befits the vulgarity Trump was seeking but he is too stupid to have known it.</comment>

<comment>Do you have schlong envy or something?</comment>

<comment>Grow up . . . . sorry I forgot you support trump.</comment>

<comment>All the anti-Trump haters hurl endless lies and insults at Trump.  Then, they literally start bawling when he bites back.  Americans like winners, not whiners.</comment>

<comment>"hurl endless lies and insults"THANK YOU. That's what Trump does EVERYDAY.</comment>

<comment>Laughable and demonstrably false.</comment>

<comment>"I SAW THOUSANDS OF MUSLIMS CHEERING AS THE TOWERS FELL"</comment>

<comment>This is a gaffe, and no one cares about it.</comment>

<comment>Ignorant people believe it.</comment>

<comment>Stop equivocating. It's a lie.</comment>

<comment>It was an exaggeration, based on a story that we all heard at the time.  There were Muslims celebrating in the area.  There was video of it in Gaza.  They really do celebrate.  Did you see the soccer video after Paris?   This will not hurt him.  He should not have said it.  It was stupid.</comment>

<comment>In Gaza. Not Jersey. Thus the lie.</comment>

<comment>Did you see the soccer video?</comment>

<comment>No, a gaffe you admit, you do not double and triple down on it, accusing the media of hiding the video he swears he saw.Do you really need all his other intentional lies outlines for you?</comment>

<comment>Just pick one.  Pick a real whopper and not a schlong comment.</comment>

<comment>"I SAW THOUSANDS OF MUSLIMS CHEERING AS THE TOWERS FELL"</comment>

<comment>"Mexico is sending us liars and rapists" "Obama is planning to bring in 250,000 Syrian refugees" and of course the biggest one of all. "Obama was born in Kenya" which was the whopper he used to get cred with the exact crowd that's supporting him now. He's crazy like a fox and knows exactly which buttons to push.</comment>

<comment>Can you post a link to when he said Obama was born in Kenya.  The Syrian refugee statment is accurate.  He is saying what he believes Obama is planning to do.  It is fair in my opinion.  You cannot disprove this.  Are you saying not one single rapist exists among the millions of immigrants?</comment>

<comment>So now Trump's a biology professor?</comment>

<comment>I did not know you need a PhD to know men have penises.</comment>

<comment>He's going to:a) build a great wall of taco bellb) discriminate against all Muslims (Mexicans, Arabs, Chinese, Indians, Poor)c) beat the crap out of Russia, China, Japan, India, EU...Does he even know that he lives in a fantasy? His kids probably had been face palming all their lives.</comment>

<comment>Great wall of Taco Bell is genius, good way to get all the real Mexican-Americans to leave willingly. Yuck.</comment>

<comment>The Republican establishment candidate attacking Trump, the insurgent billionaire, supports Trump by playing to his outsider strengths.I do have to commend his courage however, especially as Cruz benefits from Trump too much to critic him and Rubio is too busy not running his campaign intelligently to actually attack this fascist.</comment>

<comment>Wait for January.The credibility of these polls are very suspect and are never good predictors of primaries.People get serious in the final weeks.In my opinion the negatives on Trump are so high and his actual organization is non-existent that he will lose the first three primaries and then withdraw fast.</comment>

<comment>Agreed amigo, Trump's campaign is 90% himself and his driver. He has no real staff outside of a few key positions.He has no policies yet and is still ignorant on many issues.However, we've been saying similar things for months and the opposite has happened. </comment>

<comment>I think people assumed the other candidates would perform better.There was some serious morons and cranks in the 2012 primary too.  but at the end of the day there was always Romney as the fallback.This primary has no fallback candidate.  The party is pushing Rubio but he's barely gotten serious traction yet. Bush and Walker were supposed to be the ones moderate enough.  Walker never got anywhere and Bush turned into a bigger dofus than his brother.</comment>

<comment>I was reading an article that was basically saying that Rubio has little staff and has made few visits to most of the early primary states.  He's refusing to do retail politics.  He's spending his time with the elite donors hoping he can use TV to get around the hard work of having boots of the ground to turn out the vote.  No one believes this is a winning strategy.</comment>

<comment>Likewise I don't think trumps is a winning one either.  Basically he has to keep escalating his comments to keep in the news.  There's still a good 6 months of primaries left and I don't think his approach is one that can sustain itself forever.He has no organization no staff and barely even any ads.  If he tries to moderate himself or talk serious policy he'll vanish almost immediately.  And the second he loses a few states the mirage will be broken</comment>

<comment>I wish Bush would include his wife in his campaign activities.</comment>

<comment>so everyone can see that his wife, who has been in the country for decades can barely speak english?</comment>

<comment>Interesting, Trump seems to favour a second language at home as long as it isn't Spanish. And Visas for spouses and anchor babies. Again as long as they don't speak Spanish and are his own.How does that work exactly?</comment>

<comment>source on this?</comment>

<comment>proof?</comment>

<comment>She's for the general election...</comment>

<comment>Jeb's attacks against Trump don't work because the bubble is impenetrable and Jeb's outside the bubble. It's like trying to reach people who have their fingers in their ears going "La la la la la la la."</comment>

<comment>Jeb is an annoying little whining ninny.  His upper-arms are smaller than Hillary's.  He is kind of a girly man.  His has been the perfect foil for Trump.  I will miss him when he is gone.</comment>

<comment>He's a weak candidate. And a bit of nerd, which I happen to find endearing. I don't align with him politically, but he seems like a genuinely decent guy.</comment>

<comment>he is weak and soft, i bet he has never had to fight for anything in his life. compared to Trump in the biz world where if you are soft , you will get chewed up by your competitors.</comment>

<comment>Joke alert two. Trump was given money and went bankrupt four  times. His total return was the same as a passive investment in a broad based index.It is not bright for a casino owner to go bankrupt, usually the gamblers lose and the house wins.</comment>

<comment>lol trump was given a loan by his father and he paid it back with interest. are you attacking people who are entrepreneurs ? you think it's bad to start new biz and try and create new jobs?</comment>

<comment>Sure, I have no argument with this.  I am anti-dynasty.  This is why I am against Hillary too. You would never have heard of Jeb if not for his family.  George W. Bush was a formidable character.  No way would Trump be slapping W around like this. I think W would be slapping Trump around, or at least it would be a fair fight. Jeb will be dropping out soon. He has no chance.</comment>

<comment>"George W. Bush was a formidable character"Joke alert. He was so formidable that he ghosted off from duty so as not to crash and burn, literally.</comment>

<comment>Jeb is trash like the rest of that family- the fruit doesn't fall far from the trees as they sayHis papa lied his way to office, betrayed America and ruined our economyDitto for his brotherThe Bushes are totally lacking in moral character (look at Jebbie's  family- the smuggler wife, the druggie daughter) and you know where that leads</comment>

<comment>I agree with everything you saw but I will Not miss that empty-headed bozo.</comment>

<comment>The focus on the use of a term for penis is a masculine obsession. Most women are nearly deaf to remarks like that. Women have had talk of "schlongs" "dick" "johnsons" and every other version of "I gots me a pee pee and you don't nyah nyah" from the time we are toddlers.What is glossed over by Jeb with regard to the insult to Hillary is the "disgusting" skit he did suggesting that needing to relieve oneself was not presidential but disgusting, gag making.But what women did hear is that their bodies are disgusting, that their normal bodily processes make them dirty and lesser. And THAT doesn't make Hillary the victim. THAT gentlemen is the GOP writ large on women's place in society.  That all the male GOP candidates are ignoring that speaks just as loudly to the most ardent anti-abortion, anti-gay marriage women I know as it does to the most liberal among us.As Bernie says: Mr. Trump has discovered women go to the bathroom and it has greatly upset him.</comment>

<comment>lol how many cats do you have?</comment>

<comment>As many as you have of penises.And she is probably smarter than your pet too.</comment>

<comment>lol i bet 30 is around the corner huh? will the family complain why you aren't married yet? :) muhahahah</comment>

<comment>LOL you are mistaking me for someone born in the 90s rather than the 50s.  My husband of 38 years and my thirty something kids are smart enough to know that old ladies are the real speakers of truth.</comment>

<comment>lol sure old ladies know so much, that is why all the great philosophers are women right?</comment>

<comment>They are called Anonymous. Women were not allowed to put their names on their writing or their inventions until the last two centuries.</comment>

<comment>lol sure they are, there is a secret conspiracy keeping women down. Could it be that men on average have high IQ's then women?</comment>

<comment>Time MagazineSCIENCEWhy Women Finally Have Higher IQs than MenBy Catherine Traywick July 16, 2012"There are many possible reasons that women finally surpassed men in IQ after a century of falling behind, according to Flynn, who is writing a book about IQ and gender.One theory is that women have always been capable of scoring higher but, because of discriminatory gender socializing, never realized their own potential. Gender-based differences in education, upbringing and social roles have historically set the bar lower for women.“This improvement is more marked for women than for men because they were disadvantaged in the past,” Flint told the Telegraph.Now if only women could close in on that pesky wage gap."</comment>

<comment>lol plz, instead of a meaningless pop science article, post a real scientific study that is peered reviewed. that article has no data  points , methods or number of study participants. im waiting.</comment>

<comment>Misogyny and feelings of disgust seem to be a common feature of many posts by Trumpkins. There is empirical evidence to show that conservatives respond to political choices with the parts of the brain that are active for feelings of shame and disgust, while liberals respond with quite different brain regions, those connected to executive functions in more complex ways.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. Well said.</comment>

<comment>Protocol that is rooted in New England aristocracy.</comment>

<comment>Jeb still thinks the Republican base wants Amnesty.  He lost all hopes at being nominated the second he called illegal immigration an 'act of love.'</comment>

<comment>only the donor class wants Amnesty.</comment>

<comment>Has anyone else noticed that every time they show the Jebster speaking to these ever so small crowds that it's always in a senior citizen home with mostly deaf people and invalids? Most of these people just want to know where their juice and fruit cup are and are asking each other who the guy with the microphone is and is it almost time for B.I.N.G.O.?</comment>

<comment>ya ive seen the new message that Jeb is for the veterans, except all the vets are from ww2 and have one foot in the grave.</comment>

<comment>Trump got several deferments, the last for a "heel spur", and had the gall to dis McCain </comment>

<comment>lol So he's just like bill clinton right ?</comment>

<comment>Clinton didn't dis McCain. At least Clinton didn't walk away like Bush and then pretend to land a plane on a carrier to declare a war won when it was lost.I wouldn't vote for McCain but he was a hero for doing his job and surviving. Trump is low.</comment>

<comment>I never found any Jeb support on the internet.  I don't think he has any support anywhere.  People must hear his name and think of his family.</comment>

<comment>Jeb Bush's 'attacks' on Donald Trump work perfectly well with sane people.Jeb Bush will never change the single brain celled mind of a TrumpRube.</comment>

<comment>Do you admit Jeb is the one who is trying to insult his way to the White House?</comment>

<comment>I could care less about what Jeb Bush does.</comment>

<comment>The key factor behind Trump's popularity is he is the anti-Bush. Jeb! is the fat cat establishment choice and he is currently polling less than 3% ... It should be obvious to everyone that the last thing average Americans want is coronation of a third Bush in the White House ... The commoners have a history of opposition to royalty ...</comment>

<comment>yet the donor class is trying to force him on the base, no one wants him</comment>

<comment>The GOP is at a crossroads - in my view the time is ripe for a 3rd party run by true populists ...</comment>

<comment>And one of those roads leads to a cliff. The other to a swamp. Bon voyage.</comment>

<comment>You mean white supremacists?</comment>

<comment>Trump 2016!  Jeb for scout pack leader!!!</comment>

<comment>Remember the second debate? Jeb told Trump he should apologize to his wife. Trump politely refused. Jeb was totally in the right, but he didn't push the point. Later in the debate, Jeb said, much more emphatically that his brother kept us safe. It was a ludicrous point, but he made it quite forcefully and the crowd gave him a huge ovation. Even Trump, who clearly does not believe that W kept us safe, backed off a bit. If Jeb had been as forceful, in defending his wife's honor as he was in defending his brother's reputation, the crowd would have been with him. If Jeb, who was standing next to Trump and is a large man had moved towards his adversary, like Mitt did when he put his hand on Rick Perry's shoulder, the crowd would have loved it and loved him. He seems incapable of generating real emotion, Voters don't like that.</comment>

<comment>Why should Trump apologize to Bush's wife?</comment>

<comment>I didn't say he should. Jeb did. I just pointed out that he did it weakly and had he shown more spine, he might not be slipping so badly.</comment>

<comment>Trump should apologize to a few of his own. Just paying them off isn't enough.</comment>

<comment>Bush is a joke just like their whole family... It is the end of the Bush political "dynasty"</comment>

<comment>The media all of it is just too busy assassinating Trump's character.... The disconnect between media and the public is STAGGERING... Seriously we need a long hard look at our media, who owns it and how it is controlled by the establishment.. This  BULLSHYTE has to stop here and now...</comment>

<comment>How do you assasinate the character of a guy who uses schlong as a verb? I mean...what can you possibly add to that. Just play the tape.</comment>

<comment>Dean, in your case it may not apply, but men have penises.  It is biology.</comment>

<comment>Right. I have never used schlong as a verb, so it doesn't apply.</comment>

<comment>What is wrong with using schlong as a verb? Many opf you are so tied up in the PC bullshyte</comment>

<comment>I know right? Trump needs to go vully Monty here and start calling his opponents schmucks, putzes, dickheads, penis brains, and wankers. He is being way too PC by not using these terms don't you think?</comment>

<comment>Why not . I do not care qbout that. I care about our future as a country and Trump is our only and last hope when it comes to that. Not Bush or Hillary "Schlonged" Clinton</comment>

<comment>He tried to relate to the Jewish conservative donors with his idea of Vegas Jewish humour and it,  and his ban on Muslims, got him an invitation not to come to Israel from Netanyaho.This is just him practising his locker room Yiddish. </comment>

<comment>In the last election, the GOP primary voters took their sweet time trying to find a "not Romney" candidate, but they all colapsed. This cycle, the crazy uncle party is mounting an insurgency around Trump. In this crazy FPTP system, it's very difficult that political parties keep up with their constituents. But the disconnect between the GOP base and the bigwhigs, already very visible in 2012, reached a tipping point. Somebody must explain to Jeb  he's the embodiment of the Establishment, and because of that, attacking an oponent actually props up said oponent.</comment>

<comment>I don't think anyone needs to explain to Jeb that he is the embodiment of the Establishment GOP. I sincerely believe that Jeb does not care about that. Jeb believes he is entitled to the presidency.</comment>

<comment>Clinton is so getting schlonged in 2016</comment>

<comment>I think Beinart lacks a schlong.</comment>

<comment>We need less of these schlongless bozos telling us who to vote for</comment>

<comment>Pat? Is that you? Too many people telling you what to do? But you have to do it, right? Why is that? Could it be something you didn't do right the first time?</comment>

<comment>Wait Pat who? Pat B?</comment>

<comment>Pat #Left isnotRight.</comment>

<comment>Oh no I do not know that Pat</comment>

<comment>Well he is your brother in arms. And  seriously deranged.</comment>
