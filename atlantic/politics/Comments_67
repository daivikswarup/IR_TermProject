<comment>Of course having unlimited access to people's phones would help law enforcement in certain cases.  But it would also make it easier for bad guys to commit ID fraud.  How are you going to track terrorists when you don't know who they are?It also makes it easier for bad guys to access our bank accounts, and steal commercial and military secrets.  Does the FBI have any clue as to how much commercial espionage costs the USA?  Companies spend hundreds of billions to protect themselves but are still hacked, and the security wars regularly causes slowdowns and complete stops on the internet. The Chinese have pretty much replicated some of the US's best weapons, and it is likely through all the back doors that the NSA insists that tech companies install on software and hardware.  The Chinese are fingered for finding out how Nortel's technology worked.  The techshowed up in Huawei, and then Nortel went bankruptBad security is bad for everyone.  Big picture, people.</comment>

<comment>When ios 9 was first released it contained a security flaw which allowed the pin code to be easily bypassed for access to some of its contents.http://www.theregister.co.uk/2...Are there any other such flaws? who knows? Are these bugs or features?"Apple's signing key gives the company wide power over the software-level protections built in to iOS. The FBI knows this, and that is why it's demanding the company's assistance."source: link above</comment>

<comment>Apple is way too smart for this San Bernardino nonsense...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Why are the "terrorists" driving slow with their Hazard Lights on??</comment>

<comment>You're right, that is nonsense..</comment>

<comment>Public Safety is priority #1 for these terrorists.</comment>

<comment>The author's thesis cuts two ways.  The sliver of information unavailable to law enforcement is so slender, and their access to other information so plenary, it is difficult to see why this minor, additional intrusion upon privacy is significant in any way.</comment>

<comment>Privacy rights are a foundation of the American Constitutional system and the notions which both justified and shaped it.  The only security rights we possesses are from the government, not due to it.</comment>

<comment>"The only security rights we possesses are from the government, not due to it."Uh, no.  The Founding Fathers saw the Constitution as an affirmation of preexisting, God-given, and inalienable rights--not as a grant of rights.</comment>

<comment>Yes, as I said, our security rights are protection FROM the government.</comment>

<comment>Actually, privacy was not in the constitution at all.</comment>

<comment>I was referring to the Sixth Amendment.  I thought that was clear from the general context.  Sorry.</comment>

<comment>Because the FBI isn't asking for a one time, burn after using hack?The FBI wants a tool/method developed to be able to break the encryption, it's very creation might involve a weakening of existing encryption to the point that others could exploit it.  And they are asking for it, not because they are constantly running in to heavy encryption but because there are some cases where there might be one or two more points of data on the phone itself.Once the tool/method is developed it would be usable by hackers if discovered, and somebody would discover it.The writer's point is that Law Enforcement has so many ways to access the data, court orders for the phone companies or through subpoenaing the cloud data, that they gain little by what is on the phone.  Would-be exploiters and criminals do not have such access and weakening the access point that they do have would open up everyone to more risk.</comment>

<comment>Or the court order could be this tool is to be used only for this specific phone and used only by Apple (i.e., not handed over to the FBI) to crack the phone with FBI reps present.  Then Apple may destroy the code.  As long as Apple keeps the code it develops limited to non-networked computers, there's almost no risk of that code leaking.</comment>

<comment>Except that is not what they are asking for. They want Apple to help the FBI crack the phone. Once the program is written, it is like opening Pandora's box. There would be far reacing consequences. </comment>

<comment>The court order doesn't have to give the FBI what they're asking for.  The order can be tailored to use the process I described.  No more Pandora's box.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think this is a one time request? What about that murder case, or any future case? This would be the tip of the iceberg. Once the software is out there, it could and probably would eventually fall into the wrong hands. </comment>

<comment>Of course it won't be a one time request.  That's why elsewhere I suggested Congress pass a law that says this type of code cracking on tech devices can only be attempted if the crime under investigation is a terroristic crime identified by specific citation to an 18 USC section.</comment>

<comment>Good luck with that...</comment>

<comment>What you and many others here don't seem to understand is the methodology to crack the encryption will be permanently in the iphone and therefore permanently in the possession of the FBI. Might as well print it on the front page of the NYT.</comment>

<comment>The FBI is asking Apple to write software, which doesn't currently exist, which would allow iPhones to be accessed more easily. If created, this software would work on all iOS devices. Anyone getting hold of that software could break into anybody's iPhone, including yours, and access private data like banking and credit card information. It goes well beyond this case. </comment>

<comment>Note also that if a thief cracks your phone, he has access to far more than the 'sliver of information' on that phone.  He gains access to all of your information on the cloud.</comment>

<comment>Exactly right. </comment>

<comment>I also think there's something significant and disturbing about the notion that a judge (not even an executive branch member) can order a citizen (or corporate citizen in this case) to take rather involved affirmative action in order to assist with a criminal investigation. One may not obstruct a criminal investigation, and non-obstruction can often take the form of affirmative acts - e.g. "sit for this interview," "produce this evidence" (subject to warrants). But "build this computer program" seems to take it to an entirely new level of authority and control over the actions of individuals in society. It is an extraordinary exercise of power under the All Writs Act.</comment>

<comment>Not really.  Many people have the ability to write such software.  The part that only Apple can provide is the code signing key which would allow that software to be installed.  As long as Apple retains control of that key there is no additional vulnerability created by modifying the software on that particular phone so the FBI can examine the contents.  It would create a legal precedent that would allow future requests to be processed more quickly, which could be an issue if there is insufficient oversight.see http://blog.trailofbits.com/20...</comment>

<comment>We already know how the Government uses our data.http://www.cjfe.org/snowden</comment>

<comment>Aside from the fact that is not an "additional" intrusion, but restoring a capability they have had for decades, only recently lost to advancing technology.</comment>

<comment>"For the first 230 years of U.S. history, police officers managed to investigate murders without the benefit of any evidence from smartphones belonging to the victim."This is the weakest, lamest, most simplistic argument to defend your point of view.It's akin to:  math was done with slide rules, why do we need calculators?  Phone calls were fine with switchboard operators, why do we need VOIP?What was communicated in the past by victims/offenders may have been by mail, regular telephone calls, etc.  Now, nearly everything is via mobile device.  That's what law enforcement needs access to thoroughly complete an investigation - especially murder and terrorism.</comment>

<comment>You know what is weak and lame?A multi billion dollar national security apparatus that fails to prevent terrorist attacks, can't "crack" a 4 digit PIN and then points their finger at Apple and demands that private enterprise write code to undermine their product's security so that even more power is granted to the Feds as a reward for their failure.</comment>

<comment>"national security apparatus that fails to prevent terrorist attacks"That's a fundamentally futile goal for any government or organization.  There is no way to prevent all human malice.</comment>

<comment>What you call a futile goal the FBI calls their "number one priority":"We are all concerned about how our agencies would operate in response to a crisis, and specifically to a large-scale terrorist incident. But today I want to talk to you about the FBI’s – along with state and local law enforcement’s – number one priority. Since 9/11 there has been a shift from law enforcement to determining what we can do to prevent the next terrorist attack."  Director of the FBIhttps://m.fbi.gov/#https://www...</comment>

<comment>Just more evidence to support  Apple and the position that the FBI cannot be unquestionably trusted.</comment>

<comment>Except that apparatus has thwarted some terrorist attacks.  It's impossible to thwart all of them, but I'd rather the government make an effort than just throw their hands up and say, "Oh, well, no sense trying if we can't stop them all."</comment>

<comment>Can we agree that middle ground exists between giving up and forcing a company to undermine its own product?  </comment>

<comment>He's not at all wrong. A smart phone is a pocket computer that 99% of people carry with them every single day. The idea that they aren't vital pieces of evidence in a large percentage of crimes is laughable. I'm not sure what you're playing at...</comment>

<comment>Yes, smartphones are evidence.  And the FBI has the right to hack, crack, track, and otherwise perform investigative functions on suspects' phones.None of that is the issue.  The issue is that the FBI doesn't have the right to force Apple to undermine their product's security and investigate a crime in the FBIs behalf.</comment>

<comment>If they weren't taking advantage of that access to create cases against people doing nothing wrong, I'd agree.  However, the current state of law enforcement is just as much to make bad guys as it is to catch them.  Anything that gives them better means to do this is a no-go in my book.We as citizens didn't create this adversarial situation with no-win laws/courts and cops who view everyone as a suspect first.  It's on cops to regain the trust they've destroyed.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but we still required warrants to open mail, enter homes etc.  What the FBI is asking is like providing the state with a master key to enter anyone's home, and trusting that it will not be used by bad actors, and not abused by the FBI.  Sorry, but since the government had shown it was unwilling to discipline those in government who abused their power, I no longer trust it.</comment>

<comment>JA Larson said absolutely nothing about giving the FBI a special back door into our smartphones. He simply said the logic in that sentence was laughable, and it was.</comment>

<comment>If the ability to directly access a person's password-protected phone were as consistently, predictably helpful to the conduct of murder investigations as calculators are to the solving of math problems you'd have a much stronger analogy. The author's point is not that the police shouldn't be permitted to avail themselves of password-breaking technology in a vacuum, it's that the potential benefit of unfettered access to locked smartphones has to be balanced against the potential cost to our privacy. Thus, consideration of the question whether access to smartphone data (which didn't exist for the preceding 230 years) has significantly improved murder investigation success rates is entirely valid. I.E. is this even a particularly useful tool? The only way to consider that question is in light of the fact that, for a very long time, murders were investigated without smartphone data. Your portrayal of it as a standalone "simplistic argument" seems off-base. Now, I'll admit that the author doesn't close the loop by demonstrating that smartphone data of the kind which password protection protects is NOT a useful investigative tool, but I think it's the burden of those advocating the government's right to access the data to show why it's necessary. The author's point is that the justifications offered in the article don't come close to meeting that burden.</comment>

<comment>"All but the dumbest murderers and terrorists will adapt. And Americans will be left with dramatically less secure devices in exchange for infinitesimally more security."Well put.  Thanks for illustrating how we must consider these issues without the limitations of static analysis.</comment>

<comment>"Apple already performs lock screen bypasses on devices running old versions of iOS; law enforcement sends the device to Apple, Apple does the data extraction using tools the company has explicitly created to perform the extraction, and law enforcement receives a FireWire or USB drive with the data. Apple's custom tools never leave Cupertino."" The PIN lockouts and device wiping measures are all "just software." They're not dependent on any particular mathematical feature of the algorithms, they're not proven by years of analysis of the underlying mathematics. And as "just software," Apple has every ability to override them."http://arstechnica.com/apple/2...</comment>

<comment>Law enforcement is suffering from the end of the "9/11 effect." For years we praised and worshiped cops as saviors. Now we're discovering that they can't be trusted and they're having a hissy about not getting their way on every little thing.</comment>

<comment>Maybe Comey owns stock in Blackberry.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't be the first bad move he's made</comment>

<comment>"All but the dumbest murderers and terrorists will adapt. And Americans will be left with dramatically less secure devices in exchange for infinitesimally more security."An analog to this is a "gun-free" zone, which disarms law-abiding people but not would-be killers.Of course the biggest issue is the growing risk of government tyranny.  "What do you mean you don't want Big Brother reading your thoughts?  What do you have to hide?"</comment>

<comment>This pattern keeps repeating itself. Government seeks new access to our personal lives or the right to impose new burdens on our civil liberties by citing an overblown parade of horribles as the near-certain consequence of failing to cede that portion of our privacy or civil liberties. And, because the anticipated horribles are just so horrible, or we assume the policy won't affect the "good" people out there, we will likely give in.</comment>

<comment>I had no idea cell phones were so deadly.This must be why so many black men are killed by police with one in their hands.....Shouldn't there be background checks for such deadly weapons?Maybe limit the number of minutes available.....?Definitely a waiting period....Since police have NEVER overstepped and broken any laws, especially those having to do with illegal surveillance, we can trust them, right?I would say that the FBI should stick to its main job, framing environmental activists, peace activists, labor activists, framing not-very-bright people they recruit for "terror" attacks, and not looking for fraud on Wall Street.....As a poster below said, the FBI should just ask the Chinese.After all, they are the ones who actually build these things, and you can be sure THEY know how to get in.....</comment>

<comment>One crucial point not being mentioned here is that caving to this FBI demand would create a very dangerous legal precedent.</comment>

<comment>Yup. I'm more concerned with the purported application of the All Writs Act than with the risk of phone backdoors per se.</comment>

<comment>"Americans will be left with dramatically less secure devices"Most intrusions are the result of trojans and pfishing attacks. A backdoor would neither enhance nor lessen the threats to privacy for the vast majority of people. Next in line for most people in risk are bugs in software that allow intrusion. Many of these are ignored by software vendors even when they are discovered. Firefox has disabled Adobe flash in response to the unwillingness of the maker to eliminate security flaws. http://thenextweb.com/insider/...</comment>

<comment>The difference is that if Adobe were to fix that flaw, the device would be secure.  If the fed mandated access points, it would create a flaw which COULDN'T be fixed.</comment>

<comment>There are many un disclosed flaws that are known to be such awaiting fixes which have not been devised. Sometimes this is true for years. This is not different from a back door.</comment>

<comment>What did they do before cell phones? Police work?</comment>

<comment>A: Get it wrong, that's why the innocence project exists.</comment>

<comment>Whatever the merits of the FBI's request in this specific instance, this was a stupid blog.'For the first 230 years of U.S. history, police officers managed to investigate murders without the benefit of any evidence from smartphones belonging to the victim.'Precisely because there were no mobile phones 230 years ago, they are relevant now to investigators.  In other words, many pieces of evidence that would in the past have been discoverable by other means, may only be found on one's phone today.  And if that were not the case, why on earth would anyone concerned about civil rights think this case was worth fighting ?!  Poor logic and argument that does nothing to serve the interests of the side for which conor is blogging.</comment>

<comment>Rather, those many pieces of evidence simply did not exist before smartphones. You meet someone at a street corner, and who knows? Nobody. Today, you call someone, and who knows? Your phone knows.</comment>

<comment>Bollocks.  It has replaced everything from land line calls to post-it notes, to diaries and cameras.  Join the 21st century.</comment>

<comment>I've often thought that all my electronics should be totally encrypted.Of course, I'm too lazy to actually do the work of doing this, but I think it's a good idea.Why?Why should anyone, the law, criminals or anyone else, have access? That's why? The tools are out there to keep my privacy so why shouldn't I keep it?I'm too lazy to actually make it so, but in principle, that seems like the wisest course of action.</comment>

<comment>"If you have a trojan on your machine or  a key logger then this program or any encryption program will be of no  use to you. Same goes for a encryption programs using keyfiles if you  have a trojan on your machine you can bet the attacker will have full  access to your hard drive and your system.  If you have a trojan on your machine or  a key logger then this program or any encryption program will be of no  use to you. Same goes for a encryption programs using keyfiles if you  have a trojan on your machine you can bet the attacker will have full  access to your hard drive and your system."http://www.wolfmanzbytes.com/w...</comment>

<comment>This could all be theater and Apple could cooperate with the govt. surrepticiously, who's to know for sure. Personally, I would do nothing of significance financially or otherwise on a hand held device, I assume it to be potentially hacked and/or monitored. Admittedly, I don't know enough to be sure one way or another, so I err on the side of caution. I don't feel my life is any the less satisfying for doing so.</comment>

<comment>I don't see this as "Cops solve crimes" OR "Personal liberty".  I see this as "Cops solve a few crimes, and open the door to MANY MANY more."  Once the tools exist to hack a phone, particularly if the developer is legally prevented from closing the flaw, then those tools WILL proliferate into bad actors.   The net effect would be an enormous INCREASE in risk for regular folks. Honestly, this would result in a further weakening of national security as well, since now those who wished to would be able to access private information on the phones of people in sensitive positions.</comment>

<comment>First, the owner of that phone decided to encrypt, because he thought it was what he wanted.  If encryption was a joke, then he would have been a lot more careful of what he used the phone for.Second, the risk of unlimited access to law enforcement or anybody to private information is that the information can be misused, an example is J. Edgar essentially blackmailing politicians for doing things that are legal but morally questionable. Do we want the police coercing a false confession because a guy had an affair he does not want his wife to know about?  Do we want irrelevant items used against us, "he did a search "ISIS truth"? The trouble with search warrants is that they open up information to lots of people who could never get a warrant for that information.  If the police were as moral as God, I would have no problem with it, but they are not.</comment>

<comment>We already know how the Government uses our data...http://www.cjfe.org/snowden</comment>

<comment>Yes they are!</comment>

<comment>Who is crying wolf?  For the past couple decades, law enforcement has had the ability to examine the contents of phones in their possession.  Does anyone know an example where civil liberties were infringed by this capability?</comment>

<comment>Yes.</comment>

<comment>It's still unclear to me why Apple cannot simply retrieve the data themselves and then hand it over to the FBI, or write the apparently trivial program one day and then delete it the next. It's not nuclear technology.</comment>

<comment>An FBI agent has to be there in order for it to become evidence. Otherwise a defence lawyer could say, it is just data and no proof of it being the defendants. Apple does not want anyone to know how they do anything. </comment>

<comment>No company if above the protection of the citizens. Apple is about to find that out. Soon.........</comment>

<comment>There's no doubt that more crimes would be solved, and lots prevented, if Law Enforcement were able to do covert surveillance on all of us everywhere all of the time.  Therefore it is immoral not to do it.  Who knows where the next crime will come from?</comment>

<comment>Am I missing something here... The FBI can't get into a cell phone because it has a screen lock? Is that a joke? An intoxicated freshman computer science student can get past a smart phone screen lock...</comment>

<comment>Apple has a strong case here.  There are 196 countries in the world and Apple wants to wash their hands of complying with governments in all the countries.  If the US gets its' way then Apple is opened up to exploitation by the other 195 countries.</comment>

<comment>We should be wondering why the NSA hasnt been enlisted. Then wondering what the NSA found and why the FBI is pretending.</comment>

<comment>First, thanks very much to the author and The Atlantic for this article. It brings out things I have been thinking about since this story came out.FBI Director says: “A woman was murdered in Louisiana last summer, eight months pregnant, killed, no clue as to who did it, except her phone is there when she's found killed. They couldn't open it, still can't open it. So the case remains unsolved.”The lack of any logic in this statement simply boggles the mind! Not only that, it adds insult; does Comey really believe all of us are that stupid??? They don't know the reason the case remains unsolved because they haven't been able to open the phone, and they have no way to know. There could be zero information on that phone that has anything at all to do with the murder. The reason the case remains unsolved is because they haven't solved it yet LOL!Next, if law enforcement is this dependent on cell phone data to solve crimes, we are all in big trouble my friends. Like it or not the author is correct, law enforcement worked in a world where cell phones didn't exist for a very very long time. Also, like it or not, the real world is not an episode of Law And Order - not all crimes are solved quickly, and some crimes are never solved at all. It is after all the nature of criminals to want to remain free - unfortunately sometimes they do.A quick check of history clearly shows that terrorist acts indeed occurred before cell phones, and that law enforcement managed to catch the terrorists most of the time. The Oklahoma City Bombing comes to mind.The author has another excellent point that everyone really should seriously consider. What if Apple does what the FBI wants them to do and absolutely nothing of value to the investigation is found on that phone? At that point it doesn't matter - a legal precedent has been set. The genie is out of the bottle. Remember, the San Bernardino terrorists effectively destroyed their personal cell phones, and this was Farook's work phone. The chance that anything of use to the FBI is on that phone are thin.The question is: How much privacy are we willing to give up so law enforcement and government can go on fishing expeditions and wild goose chases?</comment>

<comment>Do the police / FBI know for a certainty that they are in possession of every communications device that is related to these acts? Even if they could access this locked information, are they 100% certain that they now have all available information?</comment>

<comment>The current statute permits a level of encryption.  Evidence proceeding from a government "national security fishing expedition" ought to be held to be inadmissible in a civil or criminal proceeding.  That said a construct not unlike the granting of immunity in order to obtain testimony deferred on account of the accuseds' presumptive 5th amendment rights against self-incrimination could prove protective of legitimate national security interests while shielding defendants from prosecutorial introduction of tainted evidence.</comment>

<comment>I fully agree with the author.  But take it a bit further.  I believe that the FBI in conjunction with NSA and CIA have the capability to easily ( or with difficulty) break into the phone.  By creating a false argument with Apple, and having Apple "win", the illusion is created that the Iphone is uncrackable, and therefore safe to use for nefarious purposes.  So we will have terrorists thinking that they have a totally safe device, while, in reality, govt. agencies can get the data with ease.  Too sophisticated a ploy by the govt. ?   Things aren't always as they appear...</comment>

<comment>Apparently, if the terrorists used an alphanumeric password longer than six characters ("pra¡$3a11aH") it will take the FBI years to unlock the phone, even with Apple's help.So now we know (the evidence was there all along): don't use iCloud for anything and don't use 4 digits unlock codes.You can be absolutely certain that the next version of the iPhone operating system will be so locked down and secure that even if someone offered Apple a billion dollars to unlock an iPhone, it will be impossible</comment>
