<comment>Poor Hillary is losing big among the young and dumb and even losing the gender argument. Young women are abandoning her in droves.  Middle Class people don't support her.  Her only hope is the BLM and thug market. That's why the criminal element and trustworthiness of Hillary is not a factor to them. Now, if she can just get them out to vote multiple times each, for her!</comment>

<comment>Her support for the Crime Bill in '94 will be easy prey for those who want to tie her to privatized prisons.  Checkmate!</comment>

<comment>You mean the 94 Crime Bill that Bernie Sanders actually voted in favor of? https://www.govtrack.us/congre...</comment>

<comment>Clinton signed off on it too.  So they are even in their mistake there.Also, Clinton voted for Iraq which killed more colored people than the Crime bill.</comment>

<comment>Bill Clinton signed off on it. I'm not sure if you're aware, but an entirely different Clinton is running right now.I don't actually blame Bernie for his 94 Crime Bill vote, just like I really don't blame Clinton for her Iraq vote. They were different times with different information. I just wanted to point out that the Crime Bill wasn't going to be a winner from the Sanders camp.</comment>

<comment>Hilllary shilled for it."Hillary Clinton personally campaigned for Three Strikes, so she can't say this was just her husband's policy. This is a direct quote from 1994. They say that "tough on crime" appeals to young white mothers and is used to attract that vote."We need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders. The three strikes and you’re out for violent offenders has to be part of the plan. We need more prisons to keep violent offenders for as long as it takes to keep them off the streets."Im not sure you are aware but you dont even know your OWN candidate.Or are you just being dishonest.</comment>

<comment>Did you read what I said?</comment>

<comment>Yes , you said and I quote ", but an entirely different Clinton is running right now."She is only different because she has been shamed into it.</comment>

<comment>No, because Hillary is running now, not Bill. And if get policies have changed it's because the times have changed and most people's policies have changed.</comment>

<comment>I would have to admit I would be on board with that pitch even today. I think the key words are "violent offenders." Applying this to petty and/or non-viloent crimes is where I think we got into this mess.But for rapists and murders harsh punitive sentences are appropriate.</comment>

<comment>It doesnt make them "even " when clinton  actually shilled for the get tough on crime bill and pushed the democratic congress to vote for it....Bernie voted with the dems that all.</comment>

<comment>So Bernie shouldn't be blamed for his vote even though he was an Independent and under no obligation to vote with the Dems?</comment>

<comment>His is a white state.Hillary's RACIST push for this scared white people about crime and made them want law and order.So he voted for what his constituents wanted as was his JOB!He never shilled for the bill as Hillary did and use racist dog whistle code to do it.Yeah BIG difference.</comment>

<comment>23 members of the Congressional Black Caucus voted for the Crime Bill. It was a different time with different information.</comment>

<comment>Right, Bernie now fights to remove private prisons in the form of a bill.  Will Hillary do the same?</comment>

<comment>Yup. https://www.hillaryclinton.com...</comment>

<comment>It was a democrat bill....Pushed by Bill and Hillary!"We need more police, we need more and tougher prison sentences for repeat offenders. The three strikes and you’re out for violent offenders has to be part of the plan. We need more prisons to keep violent offenders for as long as it takes to keep them off the streets."Hillary Clinton 1994 Hillary Clinton personally campaigned for Three Strikes, so she can't say this was just her husband's policy. This is a direct quote from 1994. They say that "tough on crime" appeals to young white mothers and is used to attract that vote.Vermont is 99% white.to say just because Bernie voted for it after the clintons shilled around the country scaring people and using RACIST tactics at that....is the same?........not by a long shot!</comment>

<comment>So, are you arguing that Bernie didn't know what he was doing when he voted for it?</comment>

<comment>Oh, come now, darling. Let's be clear here. We can't throw mud by connecting two simple things together and making one facile conclusion. Most bills, that bill especially, contain multiple articles of action. A candidate can sustain support for a bill but disagree with multiple parts to get the supported parts made into law. Politics is more than a single vote, dear.As many people have already stated, Hillary and Bill led the rhetoric to pass the bill along party lines, and it was notoriously "tough on crime." Listen to Sanders' comments back then. Compare and contrast.http://www.c-span.org/video/?c...</comment>

<comment>What do you mean "along party lines"? Bernie was an Independent.If you think I'm being obstinate or not taking enough note of the nuance of his voting record, trust me when I say that Republicans won't be any better in the general election.</comment>

<comment>Bernie was indeed an independent. As you have said below, he had no obligation to vote for the bill. None of this matters, though, as I had meant "along party lines," to give context to the bill.What does matter, then? Obviously, both candidates have distanced themselves from the bill, for good reason. The only differences between them are their reasons for supporting the bill. Move into the general election, and you have Republicans who are already "tough on crime." What rhetoric do they have besides attacking someone for flip-flopping versus attacking someone for compromising to get something else done?</comment>

<comment>That bill had horrible consequences but I think it's fair to point out that at the time even a lot of black people supported it because of high crime.  Crime was high enough in the 80s and early 90s that there were mass cries for heavier policing and harsher sentences from just about every corner.Hindsight is 20/20.</comment>

<comment>Who would have thought two months ago that Bernie Sanders would have been the most likely to take over the leadership of the Free Stuff Coalition?</comment>

<comment>Basically, any educated person who pays attention to politics.</comment>

<comment>Free Stuff Coalition? You must mean the Banks, Defense contractors, private prisons, oil companies and other corporate welfare recipients. Sorry but he thinks we can't afford them anymore. I agree</comment>

<comment>Corporate welfare, i.e., any company getting paid in any way by the Feds without delivering a service is an essential member of the coalition.  Which is why Wall Street has contributed so much first to Obama and now Clinton.</comment>

<comment>The donations clinton has received from Wall St is a drop in the ocean compared to what its given GOP candidates. And I say that as someone who has no interst in voting for HRC. Both parties support corporate welfare, hence all the Trump/Sanders votes. People are sick of it.</comment>

<comment>Er, no.  You need to keep up.  As regards presidential campaigns, financial institutions gave more to Republicans from 1996-2004.  Then gave more to Democrats in 2008 and 2012.  Currently, Clinton has raised more money from this sector than any other candidate, R or D, although Jeb Bush is a close second.</comment>

<comment>Can't forget the corner office jobs former officials and regulators get at the companies they "regulated"</comment>

<comment>You'd think the guy offering more free stuff would displace the scary lady that doesn't offer as much free stuff.  Except the scary lady got more delegates in both primaries so far.</comment>

<comment>She had the superdelegates locked up in 2008 too...until she didn't.</comment>

<comment>Except Bernie Sanders isn't a charismatic black man, so according to the scoring rules of the Oppression Olympics when both individuals are the same color and sexual orientation then we go to gender to determine a winner.  And woman trumps man there.</comment>

<comment>The Democrats use the new common core math.</comment>

<comment>I'd construct you a number sentence explaining it, but that's just retarded.</comment>

<comment>It is interesting that a lot of young black leaders as well as academics are siding with Sanders now and loudly complaining about the Clintons. Hopefully their message gets across because the Clinton presidency was awful for the black community. Even if George W. Bush personally blew up New Orleans, the average black family still did better during the Bush years than the Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Sanders represents the BLM movement. Hillary represent's grandma's movement.</comment>

<comment>Killary is just a bowel movement.</comment>

<comment>I'm more interested in how the average black family did under Obama.</comment>

<comment>I am increasingly realizing that this election is really the first major showdown between Baby Boomers and Millennials.  That is the fundamental nature of the divide in most quarters.  Old angry people vs. young angry people.  This is the last election in which the Baby Boomers stand a chance of being the singular dominant group.</comment>

<comment>Seems like much sound and fury, but of little consequence.  With the number of superdelegates available to Hillary, she would have to lose by a landslide in all of the remaining states to miss the nomination.</comment>

<comment>The superdelegates are available, but not bound.  If she continues to lose independents as she did in Iowa and NH, they will at least have to reconsider who is more "electable" in the fall.  Hillary has most lifelong Democrats locked down in the primary, but its the independent vote that will win in November.</comment>

<comment>Yup.  Lifelong democrats aren't going to pick any of the GOP field over Sanders.  The difference are the non-typical voters like independents and young people.  Remind me who they prefer?</comment>

<comment>At the Drudge superpoll, 30% of of them favor Sanders.http://drudgereport.com/nosp.h...</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't bet on that, esp. if Trump is the GOP nominee. He offers a very attractive package for working class voters. Remember Reagan Democrats? They might become Trump Democrats this year.</comment>

<comment>Trump offers his package to older white working class men. Everybody else hates him.</comment>

<comment>Actually in New Hampshire narrowly won among Democrats.  His landslide of course resulted from independents.</comment>

<comment>That is incorrect. There are 3,600 pledged delegates and 823 superdelegates. If she lost by a landslide in every state the pledged delegates would outnumber the superdelegates by far. Furthermore, if Sanders wins most pledged delegates the superdelegates will see the writing on the wall and go along with the majority. They are party officials and elected officials. They will not go against the will of the party members who voted for them.</comment>

<comment>"Pick off" Clinton voters?  I think you mean "win over" Clinton voters.  They were never HER votes.  And that's been her campaign's strategy: ignore those groups she thought she had locked down.  Gotta earn those votes, Abuela.</comment>

<comment>What a petty, tone-deaf comment coming from some white dude.  Stop trying to tell minorities how to vote, you white privilege beneficiary.</comment>

<comment>Is this comment a joke? Because it's literally nonsensical to say to the person who is simply saying that CLINTON shouldn't assume minority votes.</comment>

<comment>All the Bernie fans out there, do you realize that if Bernie becomes president your taxes will go up to 70%, corporate taxes will go up, there will be less jobs.and healthcare will be run by the Government and will cost you even more. So why in the world would you vote for the old Jewish guy from Brooklyn who changed his name so he would look less Jewish. Now Clinton is just as bad so democrats have no choice but to vote republican.</comment>

<comment>70% is a nice rate for the top tax bracket that worked well for the country from Kennedy until Reagan.  It was even higher before Kennedy, above 90% through most of the 1950's.  Sure, very few people paid those rates.  That is the point.  It puts a damper on top end salaries and encourages money to circulate through the broader population.  High achievers distinguish themselves through civic duty and other means of gaining respect, other than having the largest house.</comment>

<comment>Socialism is the Big Lie of the twentieth century. While it promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered poverty, misery, and tyranny. Equality was achieved only in the sense that everyone was equal in his or her misery. Similar to Sweden. When I lived in Sweden everyone would tell me how equal they were. But everyone seemed so poor and everything cost to much. But they were happy in their misery with the highest suicide rate after Japan.</comment>

<comment>We are in the 21st century now  Many socialistic principles, like progressive taxation and free education have worked very well for this country, while the free market solutions are failing larger numbers of people.  We can find a better mix.   Last I heard, Finland had the highest suicide rate.  I believe it is the absence of sunlight up there.</comment>

<comment>Socialism is a flawed concept whether viewed as an economic system, a worldview, or in practical terms.  Not only does socialism not work, it cannot work because of the following shortcomings:Replaces the family with the state as the central unit in societyUndermines the family by redistributing its wealth and indoctrinating its children in government schoolsAllows legalized theft in the name of redistributing wealthEncourages sloth instead of productivityRewards irresponsibility, laziness, and poor accountabilityEncourages self-indulgence instead of self-relianceEncourages finger pointing and shifting of responsibility to othersReplaces the self-discipline of delayed gratification with the need for instant gratificationUndermines the values that are the foundation of the traditional work ethic (i.e. thrift, diligence, self-reliance, self-discipline, responsibility, accountability, deferred gratification, and hard work) and replaces them with an entitlement mentalityTreats those who contribute to the betterment of society the same as those who do not, even when they are capable of doing soPromotes a get-something-for-nothing mentality that undermines the moral character of the individual and societyRobs people of initiative, drive, and ambitionUndermines the spirit of entrepreneurship, innovation, and competitivenessPromotes totalitarianism, thereby undermining freedom and liberty</comment>

<comment>People in Sweden have a higher sense of community-having a person to turn to in times of need--than the US. A much higher voter turnout--89% compared to the US.It is important that every person check preconceptions against facts. It seems that you haven't done that. But there is time. Just use the link, and try again revising your conclusions.</comment>

<comment>I suggest you move to Sweden for a few years and try it out. I met many swedes traveling around the world and they are so conflicted with their lives. They are so happy to get out of Sweden.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you know a lot of Swedes.  You sound like Trump.  It's YOOOG!</comment>

<comment>No doubt all of those things can happen with badly implemented versions of socialism.  The idea is to put buzzwords aside and focus on the details, to devise a 21st century system that combines the positive features of socialism with the positive features of capitalism.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I agree and it should be done very slowly.</comment>

<comment>It has nothing to do with sunlight, but with status in life and stress cause  by low status as everyone is equal BS.</comment>

<comment>Asserting opinions as if they are facts, not taking facts into account, and yet expecting others to accept your opinions as their own are the hallmarks of an authoritarian personality.</comment>

<comment>They are facts, but liberals always ignore the facts and go on emotion.</comment>

<comment>Total nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Care to explain?</comment>

<comment>Go here: http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex..."Sweden is the top performer in environmental quality, and it ranks above the average in civic engagement, education and skills, work-life balance, health status, subjective well-being, jobs and earnings, housing, and social connections."</comment>

<comment>Sweden is a tiny little country, which is falling apart with immigrants. Suicide rate is high and swedes are always depressed and drink a lot. Why because they can't move up, and have no incentive to better themselves. Socialism always sounds great but it has never worked. Have you ever been to Sweden I have everyone lives in a small apartment  with just the bear minimum and they think that is equal, because everyone else is like them. The men are so screwed up from being  equal with women that most people are single. A very depressing place to live.</comment>

<comment>Just look at facts. They are reported on that site. On almost every measure Sweden is ahead of the US. This is also true on "life satisfaction", health, education, and life expectancy.</comment>

<comment>Wrong.  Tell me, are you an idiot or a liar?</comment>

<comment>"While it promised prosperity, equality, and security, it delivered poverty, misery, and tyranny."Wait - were we talking about socialism or capitalism?</comment>

<comment>But capital gains were not included in earned income then, as they are in the Sanders' plan. They were taxed at a maximum of 25%.http://taxfoundation.org/artic...</comment>

<comment>Actually his plan calls for about 50% tax for the very wealthy.  It would be in the 30s for the middle class, going up very slightly to pay for the health care plan.</comment>

<comment>Including health tax and a added payroll tax its comes to 70% according to Bernie.</comment>

<comment>According to multiple sources the top tax rate under his plan is 52%.</comment>

<comment>You need to add the other tax to get the actual payout. You also have to include the change in the way capital gains are taxed. No sense downplaying it. Republicans will not do that.There is a history here. Sanders ran for the Liberty-Union party in 1972 which was aligned with the People's Party who offered Dr. Spock as  its candidate. There proposal included a guaranteed income and a maximum income.The old Sanders proposes a close approximation of the platform that the young Sanders aligned himself with in 1972.This tax scheme is pretty much a effort to set a maximum income.</comment>

<comment>That's for people earning (AGI) over $10 million.</comment>

<comment>I just said Bernie said so today, on the news. he is shooting for a combined 70% tax rate. that includes the 50% + other taxes on people = 70%</comment>

<comment>On who?  You started out by posting "if Bernie becomes president your taxes will go up to 70%" so maybe you should clarify who that applies to.  Not the average American.</comment>

<comment>If your taxes go up 70% and you costs go down 50% you still end up net positive.Single payer means economy of scale and reduced cost.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think costs will go down? No. Sanders hasn't past a single piece of legislation in 26 years. He's also the Chair of the oversight committee for the VA. How many Veterans have died on his watch? Talk is cheap, look at his actions and the aftermath.</comment>

<comment>From what name, to what name, did Senator Sanders change to look less Jewish?</comment>

<comment>There is zero chance that Bernie's tax plan would make it through Congress.</comment>

<comment>maybe not today but he would be sworn in in 2017</comment>

<comment>There's no evidence he changed his name.  His father was also named Sanders.  His paternal grandfather was named Sander.  Any name change was made by his father although this may have been made by the immigration officer substituting a more familiar name,</comment>

<comment>I started out backing Hillary in 2008 but switched over to Obama.I won't be switching over to Bernie in 2016.Bernie can't back up his promises. Even if he could, his candidacy would introduce a level of turbulence into the general election that would throw a Democrat's ability to win into doubt. We need to keep a Democrat in the White House. We need the most electable candidate. That's Hillary.</comment>

<comment>But Hillary is a crook and a liar and very incompetent.</comment>

<comment>On November 9, 2016 you won't be posting anything. Complete radio silence.On November 10, 2016, you will be right back to your BS right-wing talking points. Impeach Hillary, Hillary's a liar, One-Term Hillary, etc.</comment>

<comment>You did not answer the question, why vote for a a crook and a liar and very incompetent women.</comment>

<comment>You never asked a question, and even if you did, I wouldn't waste my time answering it.</comment>

<comment>Typical liberal response.</comment>

<comment>Go post your nonsense on Brietbart or National Review.</comment>

<comment>You can't even reply and defend your point, how pathetic.</comment>

<comment>Why ? You don't want to be a damn lie to ?</comment>

<comment>I think you're overestimating the amount of pivot time they'll need. I think probably a half hour at most is sufficient.</comment>

<comment>That is quite possible.</comment>

<comment>Independents wont vote for her, republicans will crawl through broken glass to vote against her, and even the democrats are starting to see her as untrustworthy and wont vote for her.she is not going to win.</comment>

<comment>Hillary can expect to get the same level of support Obama got in 2012. Actually, I would modify it up a couple of ticks to account for all of the hate coming out of the GOP side.That makes for a comfortable margin of victory.</comment>

<comment>No. It's not.</comment>

<comment>Back it up.</comment>

<comment>What year would you like to start ?  We can go back to her Ar-kansas real estate days if you would like.</comment>

<comment>The right-wing conspiracy stuff from the paleolithic era and matters having to do with Bill's dick only impacts voters who were never going to vote for Hillary in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Lol.  Hey man, you win.  baaaaahhhhhhh..........</comment>

<comment>The most indictable candidate. That's Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Agreed, but if Sanders manages to somehow win the nomination anyway I'm sure as heck going to be in his corner regardless.</comment>

<comment>Oh you're a liberal then? Silly me, I thought I'd entered the twilight zone on this website, with the nonsensical vitriol from "liberals" against Sanders.</comment>

<comment>All the national polls show the reverse - that Bernie is more likely to win matched up against Republicans. I guess the reason Hillary supporters keep parroting this is in the hopes they can fool enough of the people all of the time.</comment>

<comment>"All the national polls show the reverse.." Something often-claimed by Bernie and his supporters, but I don't see the evidence for it.The better question is whether polling of hypothetical matchups over a year out from the election has any predictive value.</comment>

<comment>If you haven't seen the evidence you haven't looked. Now i think you are just arguing to be argumentative not to further anyones understanding including your own. Prove me wrong, search for those polls</comment>

<comment>There is no national election.  There are fifty-one elections.  Which state(s) do you surmise that Senator Sanders would carry, that Senator Clinton would not?</comment>

<comment>National polls are a good though not infallible indicator of a general election, as has been shown time and again. Since I don't assume Hillary as the default candidate, I see absolutely no evidence that she is "more electable" - quite the contrary. Polls of Independents like myself show she is toxic to Independents.</comment>

<comment>Which state(s) do you surmise that Senator Sanders would carry, that Senator Clinton would not?</comment>

<comment>Spoken like a bonded member of the establishment.</comment>

<comment>Anyone who disagrees with Bernie or his supporters is by definition a member of the establishment.</comment>

<comment>No, but you are probably benefiting from the status quo more than your average person.</comment>

<comment>I suspect that 9 out of ten people who comment on the Atlantic are members of the establishment in one way or another.</comment>

<comment>She can't beat Trump. Period. Its Sanders or a Republican winning the general, she can't use behind the scenes cronyism to win in the general and the general electorate soured on her a long time ago. Add in the FBI investigation and...No chance.</comment>

<comment>That's just your opinion, and a lot of it appears to be counter-factual.</comment>

<comment>What is counterfactual? I think Sanders has a much better chance at beating Trump than Hillary does. That being said, if Kasich or even Bush were to become the GOP nominee, then yes, Hillary would be the better candidate for the Dems.</comment>

<comment>1) The e-mails.  That's a partisan Republican witch hunt and nothing more. Bernie and his supporters embarrass themselves by trying to use it against Hillary.2) Implying that Hillary can't beat Trump. That's outrageous: even though I think Bernie is less electable than Hillary, he certainly could beat Trump.3) "Behind the scenes cronyism." No proof.4) "The general electorate soured on her long ago." Same.</comment>

<comment>LOL. 1) that's your opinion that it is a witch hunt. It is a fact that there is a FBI investigation. 2) That's his opinion and you expressed yours. No facts there either. 3) Iowa. Coin flips. Super delegates. 4) I'd say 2008 and the NH primary this week would be some proof of that.</comment>

<comment>Isn't it funny how you see a supposedly progressive mouth moving, but it's Roger Ailes' voice coming out of it?  These Sanders supporters sure are some useful idiots for FOX.</comment>

<comment>Though I support Hillary I think Bernie is great and I would never tar him with GOP talking-points.</comment>

<comment>Nothing can change the fact that Sanders is honest and has a consistent and well documented record of supporting the common good with common sense while Hillary has not. Things are bad and people think we're on the wrong path. Spin can't fix that. Conservatives will vote for Sanders and have. They will not vote for Hillary, ever.</comment>

<comment>Um, every poll shoes Hillary being a worse chance at keeping the Whitehouse than Sanders.Who are we to trust, you? or our own lying eyes (data)?</comment>

<comment>"All the national polls show the reverse.." Something often-claimed by Bernie and his supporters, but I don't see the evidence for it.The better question is whether polling of hypothetical matchups over a year out from the election has any predictive value...</comment>

<comment>Keeping your head in the sand is evidence of the contrary.</comment>

<comment>You didn't respond to my point about the unreliability of the hypothetical match-up polling. Are you concerned that in fact you could be the one with your head in the sand?</comment>

<comment>Go to RealClearPolitics, which averages out polls. I tried to post a link but failed. Sanders beats Trump by 7.7%. Clinton beats Trump by 4%, which is within the margin of error.Yes, it is early but polls certainly aren't making your case that Hillary will do better against Trump. </comment>

<comment>I also see that Rubio beats Sanders by 1.5%, whereas Clinton beats Carson by 0.4% but Sanders beats Carson by 0.5%Which begs the question: what if any predictive value do these hypothetical matchups have?</comment>

<comment>"We need the most electable candidate. That's Hillary."That's simply not the case.  The Democrats need high turnout to win in November.  Clinton has solid support among Democratic voters who are going to vote regardless (and thus would also support Sanders over any GOP candidate).  Sanders has solid support among young and first time voters and independents - groups that are more likely to stay home or vote GOP if Sanders isn't the nominee.  Young people in particular are key - Democrats simply don't win the Whitehouse without good turnout from young voters.  Additionally, this is clearly an anti-establishment year.  Clinton, despite her protestations, would be the establishment candidate against any of the GOP candidates.  Also, Clinton is a terribly campaigner, whereas Bernie has demonstrated that he is quite good at it.Taken together, those factors make it pretty clear that Bernie has the better chance in the general election.</comment>

<comment>Bernie's a single-issue candidate. It's a double edged sword. On the one hand, he speaks powerfully about it due to this relentless focus. On the other hand, it's a huge liability in a general election because foreign policy and numerous other issues play a huge role and if Bernie tries to answer these questions by reverting back to income inequality he will look just as robotic and stale as Rubio did. Other points:1) High turnout is great, but there is no proof Bernie is bringing it. The GOP has had higher turnout in the voting so far. Really, Bernie is the Ted Cruz of the Democratic Party - ideologically far to the left, with strong appeal to the ideological far to the left.  There is no evidence that translates to big turnout in a general election for Bernie anymore than it does for Ted.2) Young and first time voters are fickle. It does little good to lie to them about what can be accomplished in government due to the Revolution - we know what way that path leads from the Tea Party. Some of them might stay home, but they're certainly not going to vote GOP.3) Don't underestimate the appeal of a grounded reality-based candidate in a general election in a chaotic anti-establishment year.</comment>

<comment>Sanders sure doesn't inspire low turnout but I hear a lot of people uninspired by same ol same ol HillaryThe tea party was an energizing grass roots movement fed up with the status quo and fired up about changing the establishment, who does that bring to mind this election?Don't overestimate the appeal of a tried and rejected phony candidate, especially in an anti establishment year! Damn man, re-read your own last sentence</comment>

<comment>I work with a lot of black folks and most of them are leaning towards TRUMP.  They have had enough to.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Democrats only pretend to care about blacks when it's time to vote. Trump  2016</comment>

<comment>I've heard that too from the few who have a preference already.</comment>

<comment>The joke around here always revolves around car stickers.  The only folks left with Obama/Biden stickers on their car are white liberals.    I got a strong feeling Hillrod might be surprised about "her votes".</comment>

<comment>Senator Sanders is a fine gentleman who has only recently affiliated with the Democratic Party.  He has won general elections in a town of about 40,000 and in a single House of Representatives district which is 95 percent white.  He has never faced the Republican hate machine.</comment>

<comment>Nor has he faced the Democrats race-bait-for-votes machine. He ain't got a chance.</comment>

<comment>But he does well across all demographics and even among conservatives. Hillary just doesn't have the trust factor with average voters</comment>

<comment>No. He does terrible with minorities, who are nearly a majority of the Dem Party.</comment>

<comment>They're nearly a majority in the US.</comment>

<comment>It will take longer for the electorate to catch up. Cohort replacement n'at.It's important for white people (liberals especially) to understand that politics in a multiracial society is unprincipled.</comment>

<comment>Primarily because he is a complete unknown to minorities.</comment>

<comment>If he had presidential ambitions, he should have reached out sooner. Minorities might see him as an opportunist.</comment>

<comment>No, he really doesn't. Keep dreaming.</comment>

<comment>Sanders' strength is with independents who say they lean Democratic, and among these with voters under 30. Turnout among these voters is generally lower than average.</comment>

<comment>Actual NY Times headline on Tuesday night/Monday morning:Sanders Wins Every Demographic Group</comment>

<comment>'That was the NH election, not nationally.By strength, I mean margin in a particular demographic group.Go here:http://fivethirtyeight.com/fea...By the way, people who share an opinion or a party identification don't constitute a 'demographic group'.</comment>

<comment>Generally. No one expects that with Sanders in the race</comment>

<comment>Republican operatives are likely salivating at the chance of Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic nomination.  That is why much of the praise of him in the blogosphere smells of Republican Astroturfing,</comment>

<comment>Then they aren't very smart. Democrats have a national electoral advantage, and get the privilege to salivate over bad competition. No Republican should be drooling over any matchup whatsoever of a person running as a Democrat.</comment>

<comment>No, Republican ratfuckers are not very smart, but they are exceedingly mean and unscrupulous.  Senator Sanders is an elderly, socialist, secular Jew who speaks with the accent of his native Brooklyn.  If he is nominated, the Republican haters will grind him up and spit him out just as they did with the last two New Englanders to win the Democratic nomination.</comment>

<comment>That only disadvantages him with the group that never vote Democrat anyway. The vast majority however DO value honesty and integrity and vote their pocketbook which has gotten thinner with the business as usual crowd of corporate apologists and crony capitalists</comment>

<comment>If I may ask, how old are you and where do you live?  You seem to be naive.</comment>

<comment>Old. Never naive but idealistic by choice, pragmatic by nature</comment>

<comment>Sure, let's pretend 20+ years of GOP distortions and FOX lies have absolutely nothing to do with that.  FFS, have you no shame, regurgitating conservative talking points about Clinton like this?</comment>

<comment>I don't doubt the propoganda has polluted the waters but Hillary is still who Hillary is and that is still uninspiring</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is a Senator. The entire state votes for (or against) him.</comment>

<comment>The State of Vermont includes one House district.</comment>

<comment>Oh that's what you meant. Strange way of putting it.</comment>

<comment>Well, a senator from California has faced many more voters than a senator from Vermont.</comment>

<comment>I just don’t understand how Clinton could lose in two races — okay, she supposedly ‘won’ in Iowa, okay — and have 394 delegates while Sanders only has 42. Do you understand this? I’m kinda dumb but can you Democrats explain this to me? Just doesn’t seem fair. Seems like income inequality all over again, writ large.</comment>

<comment>The superdelegates are members of the Democratic party (Congress, etc.) many of whom indicated their support for Clinton very early, before there was another viable candidate.  Those numbers are starting to shift now.</comment>

<comment>Nate Silver has endorsements at 466 to 2.http://projects.fivethirtyeigh...</comment>

<comment>That leaves 355 uncommitted, and the ones now committed to Clinton can change their minds at any time. If Sanders wins a state, you can be sure the super delegates from that state will reconsider their support for Clinton. An elected official super delegate is not going to vote against the will of his or her constituents.</comment>

<comment>Eight years ago, "Hillary the Inevitable" lost to an inconsequential pipsqueak who will be known as the worst president in American history. Now, she's getting ready to lose to one of the most inconsequential members of the U.S. Senate. I wonder what Lizzard Warren is thinking about all of this?</comment>

<comment>Huh? Clinton never ran against Bush.</comment>

<comment>Serious question. Does Bernie Sanders have a lead in any state poll going into Super Tuesday? I was looking at recent state polling on RCP and did not see a single state poll outside of NH that didn't show Clinton leading by at least 10 pts. This includes recent polling. I feel like the Sanders momentum story is just media hyperbole.</comment>

<comment>Until after Iowa, national polling had Hillary hugely ahead. Just after, 4 separate national polls had them very close or tied. Results and coverage  change polling - it's not static.</comment>

<comment>The question was about state polls.http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epol...more here:http://www.realclearpolitics.c...some are old, and gaps narrow as election dates approach.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is leading in many states now, at least within the margin of error. Clinton is repeating 2008 because she loves punishment.At least when she loses she can continue to work in the interest of foreign banks as a lobbyist in Washington.</comment>

<comment>Someone should write a comic novella that profiles how Debbie Wasserman Schultz is controlling the Dem primaries from deep underground in her hi-tech lair.  Maybe it's not underground in real life.</comment>

<comment>If Hillary were elected I think it would resemble a continuation of the Obama Presidency: 4-8 years of trench warfare against  polarized Republican opposition. Sanders would be a wild card but his supporters should realize that they elected a President , not a king.His ability to effect any "revolutionary" change, even if he had a Congressional majority, is going to be much more limited than what his speeches imply.</comment>

<comment>The horse race reporting has taken over from issues reporting which must b a relief for Sanders, who has had a hard time making his numbers add up. He seems to be doing a Paul Ryan arithmetic exercise. One of those is too many.Sanders may have a bit of trouble ahead with his white blue collar base now that he is picking up a few prominent black opinion makers. Since he likes debates, perhaps he will arrange a debate with Clinton hosted by BLM activists on the topic of "revolution 2016-what does that mean?"</comment>

<comment>? The opposite. Hillary has a lock on the back room manueverings and mainstream media reporting, Sanders dominates on policy and record</comment>

<comment>This blog post is a post about who is ahead not policy. Many others are similarly about if Sanders is becoming the front runner,</comment>

<comment>Funny, I didn't hear these complaints in any of the "Bernie has a problem with [X demographic]" articles that have flooded places like this over the past few months.</comment>

<comment>There is a difference between a discussion of who can win the general election and who will win the next primary. The electorates are different, and the issue differences within and between the two parties are different, and the personalities are different. Electability is about the general election. The horse race is about who won the last and who will win the next race.I prefer a discussion of alternatives within the Democratic party to be about issues because these are what make a candidate in a public role more or less able to advance the public interest.First support the contention that one has a better set of policies than the other, then advance a plausible story of how that candidate can be elected and then implement the policies.Don't use pretend numbers or self-affirming guesses.</comment>

<comment>Minorities (of which white's are part of now) of all shapes and sizes and colors all support Sanders when they learn about his integrity and consistency on the issue.Hillary takes bribes from foreign banks for multi million dollar paychecks to the Clinton Foundation (who doesn't let the top independent foundation/charity auditors within a mile radius).One is corrupt and one is not. Even if you think Sanders has bad policies, at least you know they were policies not purchased by foreign banks like Clinton's are.Sanders 2016</comment>

<comment>Black folks have learned to be pragmatic and to not allow themselves to be used by Communists and Socialists.</comment>

<comment>They have a policy of wishing the least harm upon themselves. Ironically, the most harm was caused by Obama to their communities in the last century. Before that it was the African kings who sold their grandparents to European settlers.</comment>

<comment>The Western European settlers were no angels.</comment>

<comment>Neither were African kings and slavers, which they still have today.Modern Slave Trade In Africa | The Hope Projectwww.hope-project.org/africa/mo... 10, 2013 - Even though slave trade was banned officially in the late 1800s, slavery is still practiced in parts of Central and West Africa today. ironic no?</comment>

<comment>You can be proud of white people, despite our flaws, without denigrating the other races. Or maybe you can't.</comment>

<comment>Im not so proud of white people.And since when are facts confused with degeneration?</comment>

<comment>Do you know what welfare is?Food stamps?Public housing?Public schools?Free lunch programs?Libraries?Community redevelopment?Community health clinics?Medicare?ALL socialism.</comment>

<comment>You go ahead and whitesplain that to some black folks and see if it gets you any votes for Sanders. Prediction: No.</comment>

<comment>With what jobs?.....the ones you sent to CHINA?.....by outside the plantation you mean "LET EM DIE"?At least democrats wont let people starve and die in the streets.Republicans literally cheer it.</comment>

<comment>"At least democrats wont let people starve and die in the streets."  The racism of low expectations folks.  how degrading.</comment>

<comment>Lewis has been in politics a long, long time. He's part of the establishment. Many of these people in Congress are just trying to get on the right bandwagon. It could pay-off big time if Clinton becomes president.</comment>

<comment>People should realize that socialism isnt all bad.For example take Upton Sinclair. He was a writer in the early 20th century who exposed issues in the Chicago meat packing plants and worker issues as well. His work lead to changes.In Europe the socialist governments that the Soviets set up in the east forced the western countries to set up similar systems offering free medical care and government supports.So my point is that both parties are in the pockets of the rich and change needs to be made. Only the threat of an outsider will cause that.</comment>

<comment>It is not all bad when it's called charity,  but when you take to redistribute with force, by threat of jail and ultimately death, it is tyranny.</comment>

<comment>As individuals of the same society, we have a deep responsibility to care for and nurture those around us, especially those who are most vulnerable.</comment>

<comment>No we don't. We decide through our politics what the social contract will be. </comment>

<comment>As fellow human beings, the innate social contract should always be one of trust, compassion, and care. When it is not, everyone suffers. When we don't look after our poor, our lonely, our sick, all of us suffer in some way, even if its unnoticeable.This is the common law of the universe, and unfortunately, no one succeeds in deluding themselves into thinking they can defy those laws using political constructs.</comment>

<comment>that type of human social contract can not be relegated to government to do for you.  you don't get to just vote for the socialist and imagine that you've fulfilled your part, only private giving applies.  Human to human interaction and caring for one another can not be replaced with a nanny state.</comment>

<comment>You bring up an excellent point, but to suggest that's my implication is a straw man.Notice I'm not calling for a simple redistribution of wealth, otherwise you'd be right in your critique. Instead, I say that the only social contract should be the one that nature has relegated to us: that we are a community.Acts of compassion and care that a community desperately needs can be accomplished individually, as you argue, and systemically, through government involvement and creation of socially stable infrastructure, and this goes beyond simple redistribution, from equal policing and enforcement to regulation that prevents economic domination by one single entity.Do I believe that one is better than the other? No. Individuals must also act with compassion as must the governing body and the structures they create. One without the other fails.</comment>

<comment>Political 'compassion and care' become simply bribes, and the self interest of the "vote for us for free stuff" party.  If that voting base ever escapes the trap of dependency, the handout party just has to keep promising more and more.  I have the belief that nothing is more self serving and counter productive than political do-gooding.    Government is to provide stability and a level playing field, a successful electorate in an economy that is healthy enough to share and look out for one another provides the rest.</comment>

<comment>By threat of jail and ultimately death?Hyperbole much?</comment>

<comment>Try refusing to pay taxes and see what happens.</comment>

<comment>The death penalty can never be imposed for non-payment of taxes. You may face jail time, sure, but not death.</comment>

<comment>I meant if you resist, the force backing up socialism is the police who will use lethal force.</comment>

<comment>Horseshit.  But if deadly force did result from the intervening cause of resisting arrest, that would not redistribute anything, either.</comment>

<comment>I said they will take your property to redistribute, and it is backed up with force, if you refuse you will be jailed or ultimately killed if you refuse that.</comment>

<comment>Are you drunk?</comment>

<comment>What i said is perfectly clear, read to comprehend this time</comment>

<comment>If one is convicted of a criminal offense regarding failure to pay taxes, he will likely be taken into custody in the courtroom.  The armed and well-trained United States Marshals who provide security are quite capable of effecting the seizure without resort to deadly force.And a criminal conviction would still not effect a redistribution.</comment>

<comment>I said it is redistributed "by threat of force"</comment>

<comment>Not true.  You said "when you take to redistribute with force, by threat of jail and ultimately death, it is tyranny."</comment>

<comment>fine, "by threat of jail"  Are you still not clear on this?</comment>

<comment>Jailing or even killing does not redistribute income.  In fact, it interferes with the ability of a debtor to pay taxes, temporarily, or in the hypothetical case of your death bullshit, permanently.Taxes are primarily collected by civil measures.</comment>

<comment>If that is what i meant i would have said they redistribute by arresting you...but i said they redistribute by THREATENING.  if it's still not clear fine, i can live with your confusion.</comment>

<comment>You are the one who introduced jail -- which is not a civil remedy except in the case of civil contempt -- or threat of jail, if you prefer, into this conversation.  You also introduced resisting arrest, which is a criminal offense.  You also introduced deadly force.  Don't backpedal now.Civil disobedience is always an option available to one who is willing to accept the consequences that flow therefrom.  A population which excludes weenies who kvetch like you.</comment>

<comment>what we have here, is a failure to communicate.  i now have no idea what you are talking about or where you got lost.  i tried to make a pretty simple point</comment>

<comment>Are contracts enforced in your world? Is there theft? If so is that subject to 'redistribution' only by the owner? Cutting to the chase (pun alert): is there a difference between possession and property?</comment>

<comment>How about by threat of private confinement?</comment>

<comment>Criminal prosecution does not redistribute anything by force.And the reference to death is off the wall.</comment>

<comment>Don't let yourself be dragged to jail and you will be killed, that is how enforcement works.</comment>

<comment>Not true.  Or at least, not necessarily true.</comment>

<comment>Al Sharpton is a regular guest at the White House. How much does he owe?How much does Melissa Harris Perty owe?</comment>

<comment>Why refuse to pay? With the right tax accountants, you can stash all your money in the Bahamas.Well, some people can.</comment>

<comment>no db, they can not.</comment>

<comment>Well dont forget there are times when the wealthy class is tyranny by itself. Think of early 20th century company towns and how unions were brought down with violence. Now supposedly our laws and our elected officials protect workers rights but those have been rapidly eroding and real earnings have gone down. Thats why we have a disappearing middle class.</comment>

<comment>Remember when state and federal officials sent the National Guard and Army into West Virginia to put down striking coal miners? Imagine that... the US government using its army on behalf of a private corporation! Coal miners had to form their own militia for protection.Land of the free, baby!</comment>

<comment>Is it really your position that having an income tax at all (and enforcing it by threat of jail time) is tyranny? If so, that puts you pretty far outside the American mainstream, ideology-wise.</comment>

<comment>Certainly, and more than you might imagine believe that we should only be jailing dangerous criminals.</comment>

<comment>Dangerous to whom? Are members of the Boards of Directors of the Fortune 500 dangerous?</comment>

<comment>Dangerous to public safety, no they are not.  They certainly can be fined, have assets frozen, excluded from doing business in the domain of which they broke laws, etc.</comment>

<comment>So if a company sells poisoned food that results in deaths of thousands of people and knows that is what will happen, is that dangerous enough?Suppose your child dies a slow and painful death as a result?</comment>

<comment>perhaps, if they intended to harm people and that is established certainly</comment>

<comment>Does that work if applied to transfers from poor to rich? How about from labour to capital?</comment>

<comment>What do you mean by transfers?  what does a transfer from labor to capital mean?</comment>

<comment>You are in a factory, and you are paid next to nothing to make a $60,000 car and the money goes to people who say they own the car although they never show up for work.</comment>

<comment>you mean it goes to the people who payed you to build them a car? yup.  but what is transfered from labor to capital?</comment>

<comment>Bernie is the right man with the right message at the right time.Killary is just a stale old corrupt bag of blood clots.</comment>

<comment>I predict the following from tonight's debate.1) Hillary will try to imply that Bernie is a racist since he's from a predominantly white state and won among predominantly white voters.2) Hillary will accuse Bernie of attacking the first black President so that blacks in South Carolina will infer that he doesn't like Obama because he's black.3) Hillary will try to portray herself as a champion of minorities and hope that the public has forgotten the Clinton legacy.I really hope Bernie brings up the Clinton record with respect to mass incarcerations, the death penalty, and the money she's received from the prison industry. Sometimes, I fear Bernie is too much of a nice guy that he doesn't want to be seen as attacking.</comment>

<comment>She'll also hammer him on not going to DC to vote on that anti-Korea bill. Which was a mistake on his part because it will be used against him. They're going to hit Sanders hard on the international/foreign stuff. Clinton knows that international stuff because her constituency is the global elite, the Davos crowd.</comment>

<comment>"And there’s already been talk about the nearly 400 superdelegates that Clinton counts in her corner, which could provide a buffer against more Sanders victories."This is very disturbing.  If the Democratic Party Old Guard use the superdelegates to override the will of the voters, it's going to smell a lot like 1968 in here.</comment>

<comment>With that simile, who will play the role of Sirhan Sirhan?</comment>

<comment>All she needs to do is remind the racist pack of antisemites on the left that he is jewish and make every question about Palestinians.</comment>

<comment>Gee he is jewish you say?......LOL!!</comment>

<comment>they are a bit slow, they haven't made the connection from jewish to, supports israel's right to exist yet.</comment>

<comment>Does any American politician not support Israel's right to exist?</comment>

<comment>Sanders will never be President, period.He doesn't the experience nor does he have understanding of deep economic and military challenges America faces.Bernie is ahead i the polls because a bunch of noisy students are hoping for a free College education and many "grown ups" like to show that they are hip and support the young people.</comment>

<comment>He is ahead in the polls because he went viral on facebook.Last month I think it was a dog who could sing.  (could probably win the dem primary if he ran)</comment>

<comment>Could be, but it could also be that he was able to make it Seem that voting for AN OLD FART was cool.</comment>

<comment>Nah , they are sick of criminal like the Clintons stealing their future.It really is that simple.</comment>

<comment>Got it, you'd rather Bernie stole your future.Have a not so nice day.</comment>

<comment>When we are the only country left without national health insurance? and one of the few who havent  kept up with the educational requirements of the modern world?.....Oh ya you got it all figured out.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you could move literally anywhere else in the world and be happier.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like you dont care the US is sliding into 3d world status.{ Thanks to CLINTONS fyi}The US is #1 in obesity,Prison populations and medical mistakes....and your fine with that.Our infrastructure is crumblingSome of our schools are so bad teachers are striking because of RATS and bad plumbing.Our water is being poisoned and its not just Flint either.Even some 3d world countries do healthcare and education better......never mind faster bandwidth and cell phone service.</comment>

<comment>My health and education, and that of my children, is just fine. I'll fight to keep it that way.</comment>

<comment>Nothing selfish or myopic about that.so you dont care about the country just you.....we get it we really do.</comment>

<comment>There is no collective good. </comment>

<comment>Our country was FOUNDED on it.So you never read the foundersJohn Adams, Founding Father and 2nd President; Thoughts on Government, 1776:"Government is instituted for the common good; for the protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness of the people; and not for the profit, honor, or private interest of any one man, family, or class of men; therefore, the people alone have an incontestable, unalienable, and indefeasible right to institute government; and to reform, alter, or totally change the same, when their protection, safety, prosperity, and happiness require it."James Madison, Founding Father and 4th President; Federalist Papers, No. 57, February 19, 1788:"The aim of every political constitution is, or ought to be, first to obtain for rulers men who possess most wisdom to discern, and most virtue to pursue, the common good of the society; and in the next place, to take the most effectual precautions for keeping them virtuous whilst they continue to hold their public trust."Benjamin Franklin, Founding Father, American diplomat, statesman, and scientist; letter to Robert Morris, December 25, 1783:"All the property that is necessary to a Man, for the Conservation of the Individual and the Propagation of the Species, is his natural Right, which none can justly deprive him of: But all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition. He that does not like civil Society on these Terms, let him retire and live among Savages. He can have no right to the benefits of Society, who will not pay his Club towards the Support of it." “As riches increase and accumulate in few hands, as luxury prevails in society, virtue will be in a greater degree considered as only a graceful appendage of wealth, and the tendency of things will be to depart from the republican standard.” — Alexander Hamiltonso you never read the constitution.The first clause of Article I, Section 8, reads, "The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and  general Welfare of the United States.""general Welfare" is the common goodThe preamble to the U.S. Constitution cites promotion of the general welfare as a primary reason for the creation of the Constitution. Promotion of the general welfare is also a stated purpose in state constitutions and statutes.</comment>

<comment>The "Collective good" has been a standard ethic of every major religion and civilization.YOU are a barbarian and not worthy of a civilized society....you dont want one anyway.</comment>

<comment>They said the same thing about the unknown black guy who beat Hillary last time remember?</comment>

<comment>The difference is that Obama had and has his own constituency nation wide.Can you imagine Sanders appealing to a single group with a large number of voters?</comment>

<comment>*cough* young people *cough*</comment>

<comment></comment>

<comment>He already has......more than Obama in fact.</comment>

<comment>I love watching people try to dismiss peoples views as just trying to get "free stuff".Sure..some people think its incredibly unfair that they are going to get saddled with a stupid amount of debt just to try to make themselves competitive in the new job market.Some people already HAVE that student debt and don't want other people to go through the same thing.Some people think that it's better for society as a whole.How many people do you think are voting against him because they don't want to have to pay taxes to help send anyone to school when they already have a degree? If you're going to dismiss views as "selfish", you should probably apply it equally.</comment>

<comment>I paid my own way through college....why are you special</comment>

<comment>So did I, and I don't want anyone else to go through what I had to.At a certain point, it starts to be extremely unfair and just make it harder for anyone who wasn't born into money. It's unrealistic to work your way through college now, and student loans are getting ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>I was from a middle class family and it was not easy......I paid every single dime myself</comment>

<comment>So? I'm going to pay every dime myself too.It's pretty impossible now, though,  unless you have someone else that can help you out.You're kinda validating my point though...people are voting against it for selfish reasons. They figure "hey, I did it..why can't they?" and they don't consider the new job market, they don't consider how loans work now or how much tuition has changed.So..instead of actually thinking about what the younger people go through, they whine about having to contribute.</comment>

<comment>So I should pay for my college education AND someone elsesThat sounds rational too you?</comment>

<comment>You're not going to just be writing a check for 80 thousand dollars...your taxes might go up a bit.Do you only care about yourself?</comment>

<comment>Taxes go upThe liberal battle cry!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, sometimes taxes go up when we agree to help out another portion of society.Is that all you think about?Do you not care what other people have to go through? Do you not care that things have changed, and will likely get even harder as time goes on?Do you not care that it could have negative consequences for the economy and society in general if we don't fix it?</comment>

<comment>Here learn something-	TAXES –Top 10 Percent of Earners Paid 68 Percent of Federal ...http://www.heritage.org/federa...Top 20% of Earners Pay 84% of Income Tax - WSJhttp://www.wsj.com/articles/to...The Top 1 Percent Pays More in Taxes than the Bottom 90% ...http://taxfoundation.org/blog/...</comment>

<comment>Yes, I know how taxes work and I know who pays the majority.Do you not care what other people have to go through? What about when they have to do much more just to get the same education?What about if it hurts more people? Its not worth it to you to prevent it because it doesn't benefit you?</comment>

<comment>The reason college cost so much is all the stupid government intervention and free money.......Empty seats will drive down cost.....Teacher pensions are out of control</comment>

<comment>Okay..you're not answering the question.If your taxes helped make sure people could get an education without being stuck with a massive amount of debt, would it be worth it to you?</comment>

<comment>No... because the problem with cost is what i stated above</comment>

<comment>Just play pretend for a second.If your taxes going up a bit could guarantee that the future generations benefit from being able to get an education without debt..would it be worth it to you?</comment>

<comment>EXAMPLE AA Fire Chief in California retired early with $200,000 /yr pension and Medical for lifeA private person would need to buy a "$3 Million dollar" annuity, plus additional medicalSince when did government jobs guarantee a 1%’er retirement?</comment>

<comment>Okay, I'll just assume that its either a really confusing question to you, or you dont want to admit that you're that selfish.Oh well.</comment>

<comment>No you are being selfish....Instead of addressing the issues you just want free moneyI'm betting you are a Democrat</comment>

<comment>I won't benefit from any free college education. (You know, other than the benefits it provides to everyone as a whole.)I'm willing to contribute extra if it means that other people can benefit.Why aren't you?</comment>

<comment>There's an apocryphal story about Milton Friedman.  He was in a banana republic and saw hundreds of workers digging with shovels.  When he inquired why they weren't using bulldozers he was told that the workers were using shovels because inefficient labor created more jobs.  "Well then," Friedman asked, "Why not make them use tea spoons?"Are you willing to contribute extra so that somebody can have a job digging a ditch with a spoon?</comment>

<comment>We're not talking about broken window economics.We're talking about working on fixing an actual, legitimate issue.</comment>

<comment>That depends on what you mean by "happier".If somebody is starving to death I'm willing to pay to feed them.If they make $50 million a year and they want to buy a new personal jet because that makes them happy then the answer is "No".So the answer is "It depends".</comment>

<comment>When did I say "happier"?I'm amused how you first tried to compare working on education issues in society to broken window concepts..now you're just going for the implication that college education is equivalent to somebody just wanting more of things when they already have a lot?</comment>

<comment>Let's say that Bill Gates wants to take some college courses.  Are you willing to pay so that h can go for free?</comment>

<comment>It depends on the situation.Is he getting a free education because we've decided to provide free college education to society as a whole, or am I just writing him a check?</comment>

<comment>What difference does it make?  He gets a free education either way.My position is this:  if you are desperately poor I will assist you.  If you can pay your own way then forget it.</comment>
