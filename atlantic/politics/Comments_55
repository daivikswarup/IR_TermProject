<comment>Given the article references the Apocalypse, it's perhaps worth the while to observe that the hysterical GOP reaction here, and the backlash that it is attracting over the way it reveals naked, an unfailing commitment to obstruction -- this all can be construed to match the logic of Revelations 18:6-8, eg "[Babylon] falls because she says in her heart, 'I SIT as A QUEEN AND I AM NOT A WIDOW, and will never see mourning.'"Babylon, babble on.</comment>

<comment>94 million Americans out of work and your messiah is touting a 5% unemployment rate???   Once again his ignorance is in plain sight for the world to see!</comment>

<comment>94 million Americans out of work? Almost a third of our total population? I wonder why rush hour traffic isn't any better, sure seems like a lot of people are coming from and going somewhere everyday and staying there between 9-5. I wonder where they are getting all that money to be able to afford to go out of the house and do things for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week. It's almost like they have a job, but clearly, they can't. I mean 94 million out of work!?I just didn't see that coming. Oh well, Unicorns now number into the thousands, they roam the fjords of Chad. I didn't see that coming, and it is definitely just as real as 94 million people being out of work in America.</comment>

<comment>94 million Americans don't work but also aren't considered unemployed by the Labor Department. The Labor Department only classifies people as unemployed if they are actively looking for work.</comment>

<comment>"94 million Americans don't work but also aren't considered unemployed by the Labor Department."And how many of them are children or retirees, or people who don't want to work (i.e. stay-at-home parents)? Look, if we're being honest, we can admit the recovery hasn't been as strong as we'd want, but if we're being honest, that stat is both (potentially) technically accurate and highly misleading.Be honest next time. You'll feel better.</comment>

<comment>No, moron.  Learn to read what even Dear Leader's Labor Department is reporting.http://data.bls.gov/timeseries...</comment>

<comment>No you should learn to read.  The statistics and I quote from your own article for "Not in Labor Force".  That means, yes, they are NOT in the labor force, are not unemployed  and  thus are not counted in the 5% unemployment figures.  As you so rightly point out.  Also, if you look at that table, that "Not in Labor Force"  figure has been going up every year since 2006.  Started at  and started at the 75 million figure.  Has nothing to do with President Obama.</comment>

<comment>They are not in the labor force because Dear Leader has ruined the economy and they've given up looking for a job.While the goal of liberals is to get as many people on the dole as possible, you guys should at least be honest about it.</comment>

<comment>You didn't read my comments at all.  Just blather.  Those people are NOT included in the 5% unemployment figures and Obama never changed anything about how those statistics are calculated.  Your Dear Leader (Rush or Fox) is plain flat wrong and you are too uneducated to understand it.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  I read your comment.  People who no longer seek employment because there are no jobs for them are not in the labor force.  Thus, the unemployment rate is kept artificially low.   Attention Moron:  I didn't say that Obama changed how the number is calculated--only that low information liberals (as though there is any other kind) don't understand labor statistics.(By the way, I learned how to read labor statistics by taking economics at a major university.  I'll put that knowledge against your Talking Points Memo, er, talking points, any day of the week.)It's amazing how you liberals have destroyed the economy, then, when faced with your own statistics proving the destruction, you go Forrest Gump and can't understand basic English.</comment>

<comment>you still didn't get it.  This report is the people who are NOT in the labor pool and not seeking employment.  Yes, it includes people who are no longer seeking employment for any reason...and this didn't change under Obama.  If you look at the report, you will see that the numbers keep rising every year regardless of who is President.   You know, kids, retirees, students, babies, stay at home wives, AND  people who are not seeking employment.   It is not indicative of the active labor force.  And my degree was in economics...!</comment>

<comment>[Face palm.]  They're not in the labor force because they've given up.No, they're not children and babies.  Note the designation "16 years and older."But since you don't like that number, let's look at the U6, which shows unemployment to be 10.5% (9.9% adjusted).http://www.bls.gov/news.releas...There is no way to polish this excrement.  Dear Leader drove the economic car in a ditch and his enablers [looking right at you] are claiming we're flying down the freeway.  We're not.  We're mired in a terrible slump.In fact, using the U6, we currently  have a misery index of about 11.5%.  The only thing saving us from a flat out  depression are very low energy prices (which, of course, Dear Leader is working relentlessly to increase).</comment>

<comment>^not this a-hole again^</comment>

<comment>saying that "it's always been that way" while reasonably accurate says NOTHING about the accuracy of the calculation and in this case it's a bigger deal because of the very low labor force participation rate.  U6 is a lot closer to 10% than 5%Current U-6 Unemployment Rate is 10.5% (BLS) or 14.0% (Gallup)U-6 is a broader measure of unemployment including discouraged workers and many consider U-6 to be ”the Real Unemployment Rate”</comment>

<comment>Current U-6 was 9.9% in January, the most recent measure.Economist overwhelmingly agree that most of the drop in labor force participation is due to the graying population and the increasing percentage of young people pursue tertiary education.  However, labor force participation is dropping in all age groups especially for those with only a high school education or less.  Most of these people were laid off during the downturn and could not find a job when the economy recovered due to a number of factors.  They generally fall into two camps: middle-age adults who are two young for retirement but too old of entry level jobs and young people who had little experience.  There are a number of factors which are driving this trend.  First, employers are very reluctant to hire the long-term unemployed.  Second, many of these individuals have criminal convictions as a result of the war of drugs.  Also, many of these individuals were able to secure disability payments and are reluctant to rejoin a lukewarm labor market.  While it is a problem, it impacts a much smaller percentage of the population than many in this forum believe.For future reference, Gallup doesn't measure unemployment.  They just use the numbers generated by the BLS.</comment>

<comment>Wait, Kim - Il Sung ruined the US economy?</comment>

<comment>No, we're talking about your Dear Leader.  The one that all liberals worship as a deity.</comment>

<comment>and that's called the "labor force participation rate" which is as low as it's been since the early 70's</comment>

<comment>and the reason for that has nothing to do with Obama.  It is low because as we are increasingly changing  from an industrialized nation to more service oriented society.  This is a very simple concept:A post-industrial economy refers to a period of growth within an industrialized economy or nation in which the relative importance of manufacturing reduces and that of services, information, and research grows.</comment>

<comment>we have been using that stat for decades.</comment>

<comment>Labor force participation rate is indeed a fair stat. That is NOT what HDNKR is talking about, though. He's talking about every man, woman, and child who isn't working. Which, unless you want to force retirees to work until they keel over, or bring back child labor, is NOT the appropriate stat.</comment>

<comment>we had been using buggys for years also</comment>

<comment>labor force:  the 'Civilian Labor Force' A term used by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to describe the subset of Americans who have jobs or are seeking a job ...14 years old or olderZach, suggest you focus on being informed or accurate vs honest...see also U6 for extra credit</comment>

<comment>OMG same old logic, that facts prove as wrong.... hello? This is 2016 calling 2008....</comment>

<comment>Ok, so out roughly 320 million people, which includes everyone, babies, those with disabilities, etc...I would believe that 94 million people out of our total population don't work. Once we remove those too young or too sick to work, the real unemployment rate is probably a little bit higher than 5%.But to act like Obama is to blame for that number? Ignorant. He didn't invent a new way of calculating the unemployment rate. It is calculated the same way for each President in modern memory. If the numbers are under-representative of the truth under the Obama administration, than it goes to follow that they are under-representative of reality for every administration.The only difference between Obama making a claim using the same methodology as George W. is skin color. They used the same method of counting unemployment. Yelling about Obama, and only Obama, doing something that every administration in recent memory did, is why so many people think of Republicans and Tea Party people as racist, ignorant, tools.</comment>

<comment>Actually, under G.W. the methodology WAS altered so as to make him look better.  The media hardly said anything.Under Barack Obama, right-wingers started pretending Obama was to blame for this change, and started pointing out "The REAL" or "ACTUAL" unemployment numbers as if Barack had tried to hide something, not W.  And the media didn't bother calling them out on it.</comment>

<comment>I wasn't aware of W. changing the methodology (or more aptly, his administration). I think my final point still remains valid though; i.e., blaming the black president for doing something white presidents did is racist at worst, ignorant at best.</comment>

<comment>the Bureau of Labor Statistics DID try to gloss over the REAL unemployed rate by eliminating everyone who had been unemployed for four weeks.</comment>

<comment>Applause!, applause!. A nicely worded essay.</comment>

<comment>Ya, I just looked it up.  U-6, which is the best measure of "true unemployment", is actually a little less than 10% according to the last report from the BLS.</comment>

<comment>8% is something I could actually believe. 8% isn't really that big of a difference (although that is all a matter of perspective and opinion) than 5%. Still way better than it was 8 years ago.I just can't believe this BS that all 94 million people who are unemployed needed to be added to the official unemployment rate, which would make it somewhere around 35-38%.  That is utterly ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>Of those 94 million, 46 million are above the age of 65, most of whom are probably retired.  A significant percentage are also older than 16 but in school.  Also, women are increasingly choosing to be stay-at-home moms.  None of these people would be considered to be unemployed by any definition.  He is at least partly right.  There is an increasing number of primarily working-age men, but some women, who are disconnected from the labor force.  However, they are only a small sliver of those 94 million.</comment>

<comment>Presidents and their administrations measure unemployment and labor force participation, they have very little to do with what the numbers are, it's the millionaires and billionaire and the talented people that work for them that make those numbers, combined with small businesses. So its really kind of laughable when some politician takes credit for the economy or gets blamed for it. Policies can effect long term trends, but it takes years, and the effects are mostly negative, if there are any at all.</comment>

<comment>U6 unemployment rate is still about 10%</comment>

<comment>Metric or English measure? Your statement similar to "tornados ravage Florida" great headline to click. Accurate not so much. How about tornado touches down in 400 block of main street Naples three houses demolished 2 killed. Very specific groups in particularly hard hit areas and or industries experience very high unemployment. </comment>

<comment>really? it's the way things have been counted at least as far back to the Carter Administration. Why should that figure not be considered now? Because you have invested so much emotional energy in mr. hope and change>?</comment>

<comment>what would the "true" unemployment rate be if 20 million mexicans were not working in the United States?</comment>

<comment>Pew, which is probably most reliable source, estimates that there are 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States which is down from a peak of 12.2 million in 2007.  Of those, only about half are from Mexico.  The rest come from various parts other parts of the world including Asia and Africa.  At most, that would cause a 3.5% drop in U-6.  Honestly, I think that you will have a hard time getting Americans to take most of the jobs that undocumented workers often have.  Also, there is something called frictional unemployment.  At any given, a certain percentage of the population will be temporarily unemployed for a variety of reasons.  Frictional unemployment is the primary driver of what is called the natural rate of unemployment.  Most economist estimate the natural rate to be between 4-8% in the United States.</comment>

<comment>Kevin,thank you for your well written response.Yes, it seems like more "white" people and less hispanics are working in fast food than in the recent past, and a larger number of young and middle aged white men opening lawn mowing and landscaping businesses here in Chicagoland. I believe this is probably happening country wide. And you are correct, legal and illegal immigration is not limited to Spanish speaking individuals and familieis. I own a construction company. Although hispanic owned firms are my number one competitor, Polish speaking companies is a strong second, followed by Russian, Ukrainian, and German competitor companies. Amazingly, there is even a rise in Indian, Chinese and Filapino construction firms, especially in remodeling.My fear is of the future.According to a study conducted in late April by the U.S. Department of Education and the National Institute of Literacy, 32 million adults in the U.S. can't read. That's 14 percent of the population. 21 percent of adults in the U.S. read below a 5th grade level, and 19 percent of high school graduates can't read. As the number of low education jobs disappear, these people will become unemployable. Over time, we simply will not be able to financially support them, their families and the hordes of people trying to get in.</comment>

<comment>U-6 is a broader measure of unemployment including discouraged workers and many consider U-6 to be”the Real Unemployment Rate” according to BLS U6 at 10+% according to gallup about 14%.</comment>

<comment>The labor force participation rate is going down mostly because of baby boomers retiring. Gee, who could have seen that coming? The Fed, the BLS and various economists have been addressing the issue of boomers retiring for twenty years. There is a Fed report from 2006 that pretty much says we're where we expected to be in the downhill slope of the workforce participation rate.Note: It started declining around 2000 and will continue to do so for another decade at least (source Fed)</comment>

<comment>The unemployment rate is totally ginned up.  Look at the EMPLOYMENT RATE which is VERY low by historical standards and is a far more accurate barometer of who is actually working.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  Dear Leader's Labor Department admits that 94 million able bodied working age people don't work.  But hey, literacy and truth have never been strong points of Dear Leader's cult, no?http://data.bls.gov/timeseries...</comment>

<comment>Are you referring to the U6 rate?</comment>

<comment>46 million of those Americans are over 65.  That is also not including students, stay-at-home parents, and the disabled.  Should we force Americans over 65 to work regardless if they have the means not to?</comment>

<comment>Giving up doesn't count, HOW CONVENIENT!</comment>

<comment>And that is wrong but the Labor Dept. under Obama are following his orders to lie and lie and lie.(I suppose you have reference for "94 million" --- (I thought it was only 32 million ('only' 32 hahaha).</comment>

<comment>Labor-force participation has fallen steadily since the start of the recession, and years into the recovery, shows no sign of turning around. It hasn’t been that low since 1977, and back then it was still common for women to be homemakers. The low labor-force participation rate got Fed watchers talking that maybe an interest rate hike in December will be too soon.</comment>

<comment>It's the baby boomers retiring, genius. We've seen it coming for a long time.</comment>

<comment>Hilarious......Yea...The Baby Boomers are retiring of course....JSMH</comment>

<comment>Yeah and Obama is a constitutional scholar and university professor </comment>

<comment>"baby boomers retiring"? WRONG. More in that age group are working than ever. Thanks for playing.http://www.zerohedge.com/sites...http://www.zerohedge.com/sites...</comment>

<comment>Soooo... before women joined the workforce, was the US' unemployment rate always above 50%?  Next time I hear people yammering on about how much better things were last century, I'll remind them of the staggering, mind-blowing unemployment of pre-war America.</comment>

<comment>Believe it or not, some women have ALWAYS been in the workforce (maids, cooks, nannies/governesses, teachers, waitresses and even secretaries - sometimes single women, sometimes widows who had children to support), just not in the numbers that started ramping up in 50s and (AND DURING WWII).</comment>

<comment>Yep and let's not forget about all those teenagers older than 16 who are in school!  They are technically unemployed too according to HDNKR's definition.</comment>

<comment>https://www.google.com/url?sa=...</comment>

<comment>Hey Genius since 2010 over 10,000 baby boomers every single day retire from the work force ( 3.6 million per year)  and thats a fact.  It hit that high for the first time in history, and will stay that high for some time.  Couple that with the fact that many of those baby boomer's parents ARE STILL ALIVE thanks to modern medical advances, and you have the recipe for the lowering of the LFPR.  I credit Obama with over 70 consecutive months of job growth despite having to fight the swell of older people who don't work anymore.        Your right wing narrative is total BS when you look at the facts.If Mitt Romney was president right now you would be touting the SAME lowered unemployment rate like a teenage girl fawning over Justin Beiber.10,000 per day :  https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>Retiring? Some. Except even more of them are coming out of retirement.http://www.zerohedge.com/sites...</comment>

<comment>My mother is a boomer but she was forced to retire when the factory where she worked for over 30 years closed during the recession. Shortly after the announcement, the CEO appeared with Obama touting their "cost saving" measures. She was unable to find a new job, though she had maybe another 10 years of gainful work in her.The pressure on workforce participation is real.</comment>

<comment>Labor force participation has fallen steadily since the late 80s (except for the dotcom bubble).  There I fixed it for you.</comment>

<comment>An abstract idea that needs a concrete definition. Most definition of labor-force participation includes retirees and the difference between the Bush years and now is about 3%. The 3% figure could easily be explain by retiring boomers.</comment>

<comment>Who are the Fed watchers you're referring to? Pretty much everyone has known about the decline in the labor force participation rate for twenty years. Vet your sources better, they're misleading you.</comment>

<comment>It has fallen steadily since it peaked in 1999.  Also, female labor force participation is much higher now than in 1977.</comment>

<comment>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that a record 94,610,000 people (ages 16 and over) were not in the labor force in September. In other words they were neither employed nor had made specific efforts to find work in the prior four weeks.The number of individuals out of the work force last month — due to discouragement, retirement or otherwise — represented a substantial 579,000 person increase over the most recent record, hit in August, of 94,031,000 people out of the workforce.While the prior two months saw a labor force participation rate of 62.2 percent, September’s participation rate dropped to 62.4 percent, matching the lowest level seen since October 1977.The civilian labor force in September clocked in at 156,715,000, declining by 350,000 people, compared to August’s 157,065,000 labor force level.In total 148,800,000 people were employed last month, 7,915,000 were unemployed, and 5,955,000 people were looking for a job.</comment>

<comment>Your quote - "While the prior two months saw a labor force participation rate of 62.2 percent, September’s participation rate dropped to 62.4 percent..."You do realize that a drop means lower. You do realize that .4 is higher than .2, right?I know, basic counting skills hurt. I also know mistakes can be made, but I am guessing you are just copy/pasting from some partisan website. You could provide a link and prove me wrong, I am willing to admit when I am wrong about something. But when your argument makes claims based on faulty-not even math-but faulty basic counting skills, it makes it hard to believe.</comment>

<comment>And actually, just copy/pasting that quote into Google search only turned up blatantly partisan websites (at least the first few pages of results were).What is great about it is that they all have the same line in it, that 62.4% is lower than 62.2%.</comment>

<comment>Unemployed individuals who haven't actively looked for a job in the last four weeks, for any number of reasons, actually slip away from the Labor Department's unemployment calculations. So although the unemployment rate ticked down to a seven-year low of 5.3 percent in June, that number didn't do justice to the 640,000 individuals who exited the labor market last month and the nearly 94 million people who were neither employed nor looking for work.</comment>

<comment>You are obsessed with this 94 million number. As has been explained by numerous people whenever you bring it up, there are many many many many many many many reasons for that number to be so high. The 94 million people who aren't counted as unemployed aren't counted as unemployed for a reason (actually various reasons).Is the unemployment rate probably higher than the official calculations? Yes, but not by much.Has the real unemployment rate always been higher than the official unemployment rate numbers? You bet.Is this a new thing under the current President? Not at all.Is the unemployment rate unjustly ignoring 94 million people (about a third of the country) and therefor needs to be raised by about 33%? Not a chance.You are ignoring or unaware of the very basic principles of economics as it relates to employment rate.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the BLS calculates more than one unemployment figure. The OFFICIAL unemployment rate, which has been calculated the same way since WWII is U3.There are U1 to U6 figures. Learn which is which and stop misquoting figures.Perhaps we should have elected Romeny so we could have had the wonderful economy he promised. Exact quote:Mitt Romney says his administration would lower the unemployment rate to 6 percent by the end of his first term.(2016).http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-...Good thing we didn't settle for the weaker candidate. Romney would still be figuring out how to get to 6%.</comment>

<comment>"We knew that the baby boomers were reaching retirement years and they were going to start leaving," Harry Holzer, an economist and professor at Georgetown University, said on PBS NewsHour last week. "What's been more surprising is that even people, say, below the age of 55, what we call prime-age workers, have also been leaving the labor force. And we don't see any signs that in great numbers they're coming back. And that's a big problem. That's a problem for them in terms of their own earning capacity, but also for the country as well."</comment>

<comment>Once upon a time, many 16 - 21 year olds worked - mostly part time as they were still in school. Today, that group is often still in school - and those who were laid off in their 50s (or older) are working the jobs that the "kids" used to work. Should that group be included if they are well-supported by their parents and not looking for work?</comment>

<comment>My wife and I are in those 94 million. When the economy recovered from the Bush recession we were able to retire.</comment>

<comment>Surprising that you were able to make enough money to retire considering you associate recessions with presidents rather than the business cycle.</comment>

<comment>"Surprising that you were able to make enough money to retire considering  you associate recessions with presidents rather than the business cycle."This contempt for people who disagree with you hurts your cause. Many Bush administration economic policies, such as paying for war by lowering the tax rate on the wealthy, are well documented.</comment>

<comment>My "cause" is championing reason over belief. And your comment suggests that you're a believer (Did I signal any partisanship? Defend/denounce any policies?) Remember, I exist independently of your consciousness. The things that you (apparently) believe about me are not based on facts or evidence, they are simply beliefs manufactured by your brain and shaped by your experience. In this specific case, you've missed a potential opportunity to incorporate new knowledge about economics (i.e., the business cycle) into your worldview. Instead, your brain "chose" to resist the new information by creating the missing details about me that would allow you to comfortably ignore this new information. This happens all the time to all of us; our brains are naturally resistant to conflicting information. It takes work for us to be open-minded.</comment>

<comment>I just reacted to your denigration of a person who noticed that some administrations affect the health of the economy by providing one recent example of why your criticism was unfounded. I made no assumptions about which party you might support. Both democratic and republican administrations have made errors. Some of those errors affect the economy.</comment>

<comment>Oh, right, the business cycle.  Nothing to do with plucking nearly half a million guard and reserve away from their jobs and sending them to Iraq, or the billions of dollars that disappeared into the sand.  Or, the financial malfeasance on Wall Street which regulators turned a blind eye to, only waiting for their own chance to join the party.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Tim, the business cycle. Of course, a president can espouse policies or use rhetoric that can damage the economy, but that doesn't negate the business cycle.</comment>

<comment>Actually, government policies have been effective at reducing the swings of the business cycle.   In the 19th and early 20th century the US economy was known for boom and bust.  Federal deposit insurance, banking regulations, fiscal policies, and Social Security, among others have made the cycles less radical.  The financial collapse of 2008 was not inevitable.</comment>

<comment>The government has caused most of the collapses by allowing the creation of artificial bubbles.The government has also extended financial downs like the great depression, by counter-productive policies.The collapse of 2008 was directly attributable to government meddling.</comment>

<comment>Bull.  See Panic of 1792, Panic of 1819, Panic of 1837, Panic of 1857, Panic of 1873, Panic of 1884, Panic of 1893, Panic of 1896, Panic of 1901, Panic of 1907.Bubbles happen when too much wealth becomes concentrated in too few hands, forcing investors to chase each other's money rather than trying to build profitable businesses that could extract money from consumers who have none.  Simple way to avoid is with more progressive taxation so wealth remains more evenly distributed in the economy.</comment>

<comment>Funny how all your lauded government interventions did NOT prevent any of those panics.And in fact was behind a lot of them if not directly, then indirectly.</comment>

<comment>Not sure what country you are from, but if you had been educated in US history you would know that the government played little role in the US economy of the 1800's.</comment>

<comment>Maybe not a direct role as it does today.But the land booms, assorted wars, and corruption through the years, sure had some effect on the economy, mostly negative.</comment>

<comment>No doubt, government has had large effect, but many positives along with the negative.  Fortunately, if you don't like it there are still many places on the planet where you can go off the grid and live by your own wits.</comment>

<comment>It's true that 94 million Americans are not employed, true, they are classified as "not in the labor force" because they are not working and are not seeking employment.Tens of millions of them of them are retired people who do not want to work and are not seeking employment — they're happy to be retired.  Also, there are many students who choose not to work so they can concentrate on their studies.  Stay-at-home parents with young children and people choosing not to work because they caring for a family member are also part of that 94 million.The number of people that are not in the labor force and would like to work but are not looking for a job* is around 6 million.source:http://www.bls.gov/news.releas...* if they were looking for a job, they would be counted as "unemployed".</comment>

<comment>Happy to be retired? Apparently not, because they are going back into the workforce in record numbers-- pushing out younger workers. Thanks Obama!http://www.zerohedge.com/sites...</comment>

<comment>About 46 million Americans are over 65.</comment>

<comment>The official "unemployment rate" is deceptive because it only counts workers recently laid off who are registered with state employment agencies and receiving benefits. Many American workers have been permanently pushed out of certain occupations by illegal immigrant dominated job sites and low wages.  Most are not being offered higher paying jobs or "retraining."If the economy was as good as Obama says, the FED would be raising rates, yet the first little bump, in what over 6 years, is not having the intended results.  Wages are still stagnant and there is still too little investment.  The Obama economy is anemic at best.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the official unemployment rate does overlook some people and certain segments of the population, I don't think anyone is really denying that.However, claiming that all 94 million people who are unemployed need to be added to official unemployment rate is crazy at best. There are many reasons not be included in the unemployment rate if you are unemployed, many of them quite valid.Using large numbers of unemployed people (like the 94 million constantly being brought up), to argue that the official rate is way off and needs to be adjusted to include that 94 million people is even more deceptive, ignorant, and denies the basic tenants of calculating the unemployment rate in our economy (that many high schoolers learn or are at least taught).</comment>

<comment>About a 100 million filed for taxes out of about 230 millions eligible to work. Another 100 million to old or too young to work.You expect the unemployment figures to be HONEST and TRUTHFUL???HAW HAW HAW!</comment>

<comment>If what you say is true then why are more Americans on food stamps and other forms of welfare than any other time in our nation?  If things are so great then why do liberals wet their pants in rage when we talk about thinning the welfare rolls. </comment>

<comment>Unemployed individuals who haven't actively looked for a job in the last four weeks, for any number of reasons, actually slip away from the Labor Department's unemployment calculations. So although the unemployment rate ticked down to a seven-year low of 5.3 percent in June, that number didn't do justice to the 640,000 individuals who exited the labor market last month and the nearly 94 million people who were neither employed nor looking for work.</comment>

<comment>Oh....we only have retiree's and disabled that are not working??   hahahahahahahahahaha.....youre killling me!</comment>

<comment>You really enjoy twisting facts and statements to fit your world view, don't you? No one claims that it is only the disabled and retired not working. You reply as if that is the claim being made.Logic and rationality tell me that some of those people who stopped looking for work did so because they retired or are disabled. Logic and rationality tell me that while the number may be a relatively small percent, that some people over 16 don't participate in the workforce because they simply don't have to. Their parents, grandparents, or whatever great-grand parents made enough money that their bloodline doesn't have to work for generations. Isn't that part of the American Dream? To provide for your children a better life than yours?In short, logic and rationality tell me that there is a ton of possible reasons that labor participation rate is falling, (although the numbers you provided to indicate it is falling in a different post actually indicate it is slowly rising). To claim that it is all the result of one and only one reason is absurd. To claim that all of the blame falls on the only president to have a non-lily white skin color is even further absurd (not to mention other things)</comment>

<comment>Actually we do believe in both. What the 1st Amendment says about freedom of speech is "CONGRESS respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; OR ABRIDGING THE FREEDOM OF SPEECH, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances." (CAP MINE).First - I seriously doubt anyone in this comment thread is a member of Congress.Second - none of us is attempting to "abridge freedom of speech"Third (and most important) - it does NOT say that there are NO CONSEQUENCES for exercising one's freedom of speech. Yelling fire FALSELY in a crowded theater can get you arrested; making ugly comments about a group that you hate  in earshot of your boss, who is a member of that group can get you FIRED, etc. DEAL WITH IT!</comment>

<comment>You seem to be unaware that in the US, folks with a DROP of black blood have historically been called black by some groups (and a DROP of Native/Indian blood made them Indian, and a DROP of Asian blood made them Asian and so on).Yes, Obama is half and half - unlike Tiger Woods (who is half black and whose mother is a mix of Thai, Chinese and Dutch, so mostly Asian) pointed that out when folks babbled about the "new black golfer" when he first went pro - he wanted know why they didn't ask about his Asian ancestry.</comment>

<comment>Do you have a cite for 94 million Americans out of work? That figure seems rather high.</comment>

<comment>Here ya go.http://www.zerohedge.com/news/...</comment>

<comment>Nice diversion, troll.</comment>

<comment>FACT's suck I know</comment>

<comment>And unfortunately, after an article about Scalia, there are literally HUNDREDS of commenters here who fed the troll and went on and on and on and on about labor and unemployment. And you and I are the only ones who seem to have noticed ...</comment>

<comment>Your number is based on labor participation.  That's not "out of work"; that's everyone over the age of 16 who isn't working full time34 million people are retired20 million people are in college full time11 million people between 16 and 18 are in high school full time12 million people receive federal disability because they can't work for reasons ranging from genetics to getting struck by an IEDThat's 77 million of your 94 million.  Also included in that 94 million but not officially counted anywhere will be stay-at-home parents, people taking sabaticals, etc.So, I'm sorry who's ignorant.  Or do you think government should close schools and colleges and force people onto the assembly line; Should the BLS storm homes and rip stay-at-home moms away from their toddlers and chain them to fast food counters; should the Army confiscate the pensions from the retired and direct them at bayonet point to start cleaning hotels?You people are lunatics!</comment>

<comment>The truth is not to be welcomed anywhere today.about a 100 million filed for taxes out of about 230 millions eligible to work.</comment>

<comment>No sir, it is your ignorance that is in plain sight. The BLS official unemployment rate (U3) is 4.9%. It has been calculated the same way since WWIIYour 94 million out of work (not sure if that is an accurate number) is labor force participation rate. It counts everyone in the country over the age of 16. Due to the baby boomers retiring that rate will go down, but that is something we've known for years. Look at the Fed Report in 2006 it specifically mentions the drop and that it will continue for at least another decade. Another factor is more teens are going to college instead of working. That paper was written two years before the election.Anyone who has an ounce of sense looks at the real data. Ignorant people believe their right wing b.s. media reports.</comment>

<comment>To see the true unemployment rate you must look at participation rate which has been collapsing since obama took office. It is currently at 62.6% (Was at 66% under Bush) according to the BLS or under 2/3 of Americans are working but are not recorded as unemployed because most are not actively seeking work so the 94 million mark is accurate as their is 1/3 of the population not working or looking for work. The unemployment rate can easily be adjusted because the definition of looking for work is so loose. So when Obama talks about a low unemployment rate can you really take his word at it?http://data.bls.gov/timeseries...http://www.breitbart.com/big-g...http://www.richmond.com/busine...</comment>

<comment>Off topic.</comment>

<comment>You can get any number you want by manipulating the denominator.  In this case the entire labor force number is being manipulated to get the patently ridiculous and false unemployment number </comment>

<comment>Who is this  so called "messaih" anyway?</comment>

<comment>ROFLOL.Your "obstruction" is more properly known as "doing their job."If their voters want your agenda stopped, it is their duty to cater to their voters, not to you.</comment>

<comment>Their job is to govern.  Not to make sure that government stands still forever.</comment>

<comment>Let me ask you this if "Their job is to govern. Not to make sure that government stands still forever", why didn't Obama rubber stamp all bills passed by congress? Especially relating to certain oil pipelines. OOO YES, because sometimes, when one party is trying to push through changes, the opposing party will try to stop those changes because they feel they are harmful rather than helpful.</comment>

<comment>The GOP representatives want Obama's agenda stopped not because of its contents but because it is Obama's, they've been doing so obsessively since the beginning of this presidency. Meanwhile, the representatives' job you are alluding to, is precisely to represent their voters for the task of engaging with the points of the agenda as the voters can't (both because these points emerge after the voting, and because the voting isn't expressive enough to convey detailed wants). OTOH, for just saying "no" to Obama because it's Obama, there's no need for representatives, and that's NOT their job.</comment>

<comment>Yep....They were able to stop the ACA right?  LOL</comment>

<comment>Mathematicians conclude with QED when they've properly made a logical point. Your concluding with LOL after failing to make a logical point, provides an interesting comparison.</comment>

<comment>Wrong!  It is their duty to work for ALL Americans.  Not just "their voters".  What helps (and is a right for) all Americans is to have a fully functioning Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>and the libs never prevented an appointee?</comment>

<comment>Can't you see a difference between preventing a given appointee that you evaluate, and OTOH pledging in advance to prevent any appointee that could get presented?</comment>

<comment>I believe the TPers can see the difference but keep forgetting, and then are reminded and understand briefly before forgetting again as Obama Derangement Syndrome clouds their brains.</comment>

<comment>I'm willing to bet if Obama presented a conservative judge the Senate would pass him/her through. But, based on who Obama has nominated in the past...do you really think thats likely?</comment>

<comment>Can nowadays a judge be at once SCOTUS capable and conservative-looking enough to TPers? Even the originalist Scalia on occasions defied the expectations of popular conservative sentiment. His originalism allowed him the most self-righteousness possible to a Supreme Court Justice worth of the name, You mean a successor originalist?</comment>

<comment>…or conservatives want to obstruct bad ideas and poor appointments to the bench.  There's that.</comment>

<comment>Nobody can identify bad ideas or poor appointments before whatsoever attending to them, so pretexting of their possibility beforehand is or would be just that, an indefensible pretext.</comment>

<comment>Complete the sequence: Sotomayor, Kagan, _________.  Bad, Bad, and __________.</comment>

<comment>No idea what you mean nor how it articulates with my point that rejecting a given appointee that you evaluate, is distinct from pledging to obstruct any appointee before knowing who it is.</comment>

<comment>The guy has a low batting average.  When it can wait, why put him up to bat?</comment>

<comment>Oh, I see, zombies don't really dialog, they just persist.</comment>

<comment>How can they know the nominee is poor before anyone has been nominated?</comment>

<comment>Its pretty easy to guess that a left wing liberal isn't going to pick a conservative leaning replacement to the SCOTUS.</comment>

<comment>Why does it HAVE to be a conservative? What's so unacceptable about a centrist?</comment>

<comment>Actually, the next candidates, and all those that follow have to be originalists.\But then ALL judges should be.If they are, who cares about their personal political views.</comment>

<comment>You really think Obama is going to pick a Roberts? Be honest with thy self.</comment>

<comment>You are confusing center right with the actual center.</comment>

<comment>Because of the guy picking.</comment>

<comment>That's how 6 year olds act. Not how a deliberative house of Congress should act. Being unwilling to even listen make you unfit for Government. Listening is not the same as agreeing, or rubber stamping. It's just hearing out an idea. What a bunch of weaklings.</comment>

In other words, we have an eternity of a boot stomping a human face.Josef Stalin and the Little Austrian Corporal's every dream has come true.</comment>

<comment>LOL!</comment>

<comment>The backlash you describe is imaginary.  A figment of the under developed liberal frontal lobe.  The gibs me dat crowd that makes up the majority of the democratic electorate doesn't even know what the SCOTUS is </comment>

<comment>The Constitution says that the President shall appoint justices to the Supreme Court "with the Advice and Consent of the Senate."  Odd how liberals construe the President's Constitutionally-mandated nomination as equal to an anointing from God, but then characterize conservatives' equally Constitutionally-mandated advice and consent as "obstructionism."</comment>

<comment>Matt 7:3-5 -- saying that the POTUS should not appoint a candidate or that the GOP-dominated senate should not agree to any, IOW denying consent before there is any object to consent to, that's not "advice" by any measure and definitely appears to diverge from what the Constitution says, as the historical record incidentally confirms.</comment>

<comment>liberal babble indeed!</comment>

<comment>Are you always an idiot, or was the day you made that comment special?</comment>

<comment>Are you saying that Mitch McConnel's immediate call upon learning of Scalia's passing, to have the appointment of his replacement postponed, does not reveal naked the commitment to obstruct Obama that's been constant since he was first elected; or that "I sit as a queen, I am not a widow and I won't know grief" is not a shoe that fits the attitude of the GOP establishment on the issue of Scalia's replacement?</comment>

<comment>You are insistent on making my point.</comment>

<comment>Lowlives confuse the throwing of insults with making a point. I gave you a chance to rectify. Unfortunately for you, you confirm.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha, that's funny! You start out insulting a whole paste of people and then object when on the receiving end. Typical lib mentality, and further confirmation of my original comment.</comment>

You've therefore yet to say anything substantive. BTW, last time I set foot in your country was in the late seventies. I express myself not as a "lib" but as a world citizen angered that GOP parliamentary obstructionism precludes the US from taking leadership responsibilities on matters of climate change.</comment>

<comment>Do you consider your own reaction hysterical?  The GOP reaction is quite reasonable.  Not one but two of the president's previous picks voted to give the government a new power not found in the constitution, and, as a result, millions of people were thrown off their health care plans, despite repeated promises that they would not be.  A Vote of No Confidence on his future picks is more than reasonable.  The President's party was thrown out of the Senate partly to prevent more such picks going through.  Blame the people.If you'd calm down, take a deep breath, and think clearly, this might have occurred to you on your own.</comment>

<comment>The GOP reaction is just as reasonable as is gerrymandering. Like the latter, it may even be legal. That doesn't make it a sound or moral attitude. You talk of it as if SCOTUS was a sort of electoral college. This should all presto be taken at Sep. McConnel's word and presented to the 8-members strong SCOTUS in lawsuit form. If the declaration made just before Scalia's passing, by Chief Justice Roberts (nominated by W) is to be taken as representative of the court, there will soon enough exist authorized opinions.Also, the tone of your summary makes it sound as if the viewpoint you are exposing is almost consensual. As you might have picked up from my other comments, I live a continent away and didn't set foot in the US in nearly 40 years. So you make me wonder, how many of the assertions you align correspond to talking points that Fox News promoted enough times that they became convention between most members of their audience? I don't have access to Fox News here.</comment>

Or just to address what they say, instead of replacing it with what you imagine their position to be. My question here you picked up on, was demanding to someone who'd called me an "idiot" in response to something I'd written, to stick THE LEAST to the point, by providing JUST A BIT of more precise info on what he disagreed with IN WHAT I'D SAID. And it's not that difficult to do, just state one of-- No I don't agree a commitment to obstruct Obama was ever manifest. Or else;-- I agree that a commitment to obstruct Obama was arguably present, but I disagree that McConnel's precipitated pledge reveals it naked. Or else;-- I agree that a commitment to obstruct Obama was present and reveals naked in McConnel's letter, but I disagree that "I am sitting as a queen, I am not a widow and I won't know grief" is a shoe that fits the attitude.</comment>

<comment>Given that there are several other Justices near 80, the only logical explanation for GOP panic is that they suspect they might not win the Presidency. In which case they should focus on deciding on a good candidate.</comment>

<comment>The fallacy in your comment is "logical explanation" which implies the GOP carefully thought through all the implications of their initial response. I'm guessing they rue their brash intransigence. I could be wrong though. I'm still a registered Republican but the GOP has gone off the rails and I can't make any sense of most of them now. It's pretty much crazy town USA - a vision of the world I do not see.I still get their 'how to vote' mailers. If I find I've decided to vote the same as recommended, I double check the issue or candidate to see if I missed something.</comment>

<comment>This is why I am now a proud democrat. Time for republicans to wonder in the desert for forty years</comment>

<comment>I have always been registered NPA, I have voted for both party's before, and will continue to do-so. WHAT WE NEED is informed, common sense voters that do not treat politics like a football team fan... and that's exactly what it's come to.</comment>

<comment>True. 9/11 happened; the 24-hour news cycle was born, and it's been downhill ever since. </comment>

<comment>True, news-drama has something to do with it... but most of the fault stays with us, the citizens for allowing this mockery to continue to happen, our system is broken... we can all agree on that I hope.</comment>

<comment>The problem is deeper than the news cycle or citizens not voting. You have to start with the question "why are people not voting" to which there are a myriad of answers, some more impactful than others.The most common answer is that people are bored or angry over the gong show that the US congress has become. However, that too is merely a symptom not a cause.For the last 4 decades or so there has been a war going on that has largely destroyed the US primary and secondary educational system. It is a war against independent thought and reasoning; the ability to cogently think for one's self. Education in America has been severely dumbed down and that serves the greater needs of a very small percentage of the population, those who seek control. An ignorant citizenry (one without the intellectual tools to educate themselves) is one easy to control and manipulate. There's nothing new, nothing revelatory in that, its the scale of the problem that is.Quaestio Auctoritate.</comment>

<comment>My lady has a D.Ed, education has taken the biggest hit, no denying that.</comment>

<comment>Smarter: Excellent, thank you.</comment>

<comment>You're welcome</comment>

<comment>Yes!  A new term has surfaced in our pop culture: "low information voters". To me, that says it all.</comment>

<comment>Don't forget also that the more 3rd world the countries population gets the lower its average IQ will become. Allowing unlimited immigration from countries with average IQs around 70 or 90 isn't doing us any favors either. </comment>

<comment>Which countries are those, exactly?</comment>

<comment>South America, the middle east and Africa specifically. I'm sort of ambivalent about the whole thing to be honest. Recent immigrants from those places do tend to vote dem so I'm not totally against them even if it does mean a realignment of national IQ to 3rd world levels.</comment>

<comment>Well, OK, those are two continents and a region, not countries, but never mind -- what is your data on the average IQ of those "areas"?</comment>

<comment>Here is the countries of the world by IQ from a moderate source. https://iq-research.org/en/pag...Anyway yeah I just noticed you 're right and that Africa and the Middle East aren't actually countries but regions. Thanks for the heads up on that. From what I understand though regions are composed of similar countries for the most part. </comment>

<comment>I'm not going to argue that some regions have higher IQ's than others, but the bottom of your list gets into the absurd. The bottom of the list shows ~25 countries that all have populations where over half the population would qualify as mentally retarded. That just doesn't make sense, there has got to be some major unaccounted for bias in the IQ testing.</comment>

<comment>Your presumption that ID values should be normative across the planet is a false one.This subject has been studied and even after removing cultural bias, certain populations just score much lower than others.Monkeys qualify as "mentally retarded" by most definition. Yet they are nonetheless able to survive, feed themselves, reproduce and even raise their young.Such a metric is not a good one.</comment>

<comment>I understand that IQ values will vary by region (I won't even attempt to argue that Hong Kong average is 108). However, these values don't show variations that make sense. A swing >30 points from known averages is to high. I would also call BS if a country listed had a 130 average, even if it was Israel, who has had more nobel prize winners per capita than any other country. The IQ swing is too great. You are talking about greater than 2 standard deviations from the mean average of all humans.</comment>

<comment>This theory has been tested and rejected, in the 70's to 90's, by reputable scientists. Murray and Herrnstein  are the Andrew Wakefield of Social psychology. They made good bucks.</comment>

<comment>Thank goodness for that. I always was a bit skeptical about it because South America, the Middle East and Africa are just as productive, safe, and advanced as anywhere in Western Europe or east Asia. I'm glad it's been debunked. Can you throw up some links? I'd like to see the tests where Nigerians and Ethopians scored as high as Koreans.</comment>

<comment>American Renaissance is an amusing little website, isn´t it?</comment>

<comment>The theories were rejected as politically incorrect. This is not the same as disproved on the evidence.</comment>

<comment>You are confusing IQ with education and not accounting for the well understood cultural bias of standard IQ tests  - they are not the same. the spread of IQ across immigrants is the same as it is for non-immigrants. Those who promote the belief that it is otherwise are doing so for more nefarious reasons.</comment>

<comment>That's an excellent point that many people don't understand about IQ test. They are biased towards the Europeans who invented them which is why East Asians do the best on them.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, there is a lot of cultural bias in identifying the patterns among shapes. Good point.</comment>

<comment>Best comment I've read on this thread.  Those in power don't want a strong, educated, united, middle class that can threaten their hold.  They want the status quo except with themselves gaining more money and power.  </comment>

<comment>Thank you. They want to continue the dumbing down until there are only three classes, those in abject poverty, those in near poverty (the so called middle class) and the wealthy, with almost zero chance of going from poor to wealthy, at least by legal means. Their work is not yet finished which is why some still do make it especially in tech related fields.</comment>

<comment>"some still do make it especially in tech related fields."Enter H1B abuse.  H1Bs are brought in to replace employees at lower wages.  What happened at Disney is a common theme where employees are required to train them on the way out.  In addition they regularly are required to work extra hours for no extra pay even though classified as contractors.  This is a violation of FLSA, but they can't stand up for their rights or they will be deported.I emailed my senator and in the response, she said she supported increasing the number of H1Bs.  This surprised me as she is a staunch democrat.  I am realizing that two parties is an illusion.  There is one party - the powerful and the rest of us.</comment>

<comment>You were surprised that a "staunch democrat" supports immigration? Not that quick are you?</comment>

<comment>When it goes against the interest of unions that support democratic candidates, yes.</comment>

<comment>Unions already vote democrat, immigrants can't vote yet. So what would you do? Support the guy already voting for you no matter what you do or attempt to sway the guy who may or may not vote for you in the future?</comment>

<comment>Thank you for a sensible comment. We certainly do need that. Sadly though, common sense is not now and has never been 'common'.</comment>

<comment>Interestingly it was a baseball strike that brought us Newt Gingrich and the Contract On America.We are still paying for this as a country, Trump, Cruz and all the other nutballs prove that on a daily basis.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans control both houses of Congress, and a majority of state governments.  What would you consider their success to be?</comment>

<comment>Mischief what is that an Irish name? Are you from robotistan? Not sure of the reasons. Do know that the party of what's in it for me have lost the popular vote by millions at the national level repeatedly. Also know that voter turnout is the lowest on record since the '40s particularly in non presidential years. Our state has close to 50% registered democrats. Zero high office and very low count in the statehouse.  </comment>

<comment>I agree, but they have been "off the rails" since 2008. seriously... "death panels", scare tactics... bullying & childhood temper tantrums (refusing to do their job more than once).</comment>

<comment>No we're not. Bernie has more devotees than any Republican.</comment>

<comment>That's a bit of an unfair comparison.On one side you have 2 candidates, on the other ??We'll see what that looks like when there are the same number of candidates on both sides.</comment>

<comment>Janet, I'm not speaking of the brain dead!  BTW.....If Bernie does by some ridiculous chance win, I give you my word that I will help you and Bernie plant those "Magical Tree's" that will help produce all of Bernie's free sh%t he is promising you ignorant entitled youngsters</comment>

<comment>How do they get people like you to post this kind of stuff?  Any realistic appraisal of the facts, in context historically, show that what you're saying is very, wrong.  Does someone pay you per post, or do you like to spread mis-information as a hobby?  'The GOP healthcare reform didn't look anything like the ACA..."  You mean the Romney type plan, or the totally non-existent imaginary replacement the Republicans are still working on?  Also:  "...the GOP losing....That aint going to happen!"  It's pretty clear the only actual mysteries are:  which Dem is going win, and which of the clowns will be the loser.</comment>

<comment>You are spewing right-wing talking points like you can't help yourself.  You do know you're making a fool of yourself, right?  Fox Nation loves this kind of stuff, why aren't you over there?  The bar of intellect is much lower.</comment>

<comment>I know that you have a real hard time telling the truth because there is no such investigation, and there is no one named "killary."The fact that you use this type of rhetoric shows you to be about twelve years-old, with right wing wingnut parents, and one must assume that When Limbaugh is not on in your household, the default is Faux News.The supreme irony is that as you rant the Republican Party, after the ill-considered idea of getting into bed with the Tea Party, is imploding in front of our very eyes, and even Lindsey Graham has seen the writing on the wall.When Trump gets nominated, not only will that guarantee a Democrat in the White House but it will take many of the down-ticket races with him.I love the smell of an imploding GOTP. It smells like mountain top coal mining dying a slow horrible death.</comment>
