<comment>Trump locks up SC primary in historical  landslide.  Nikki Haley fails to deliver for Robio.  Jeb't the deb't and Cruz, well, they lose.  Gotta love it.   Pope energy is kaput.</comment>

<comment>Don't mind Trumps hypocrisy of both wanting protectionism for US companies while calling for a boycott of Apple for Samsung.</comment>

<comment>You're not seriously calling Apple a U.S. company?  Headquartered in the U.S., Apple has all its products manufactured by Foxconn in the Kleptocratic Republic of China.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I am because it is.</comment>

<comment>Donald Trump WILL be your next President.  Maybe you should write a stinging letter to the Times?</comment>

<comment>LOLI doubt it very much but your overzealous support for him is funny to watch.  Please keep it up.</comment>
