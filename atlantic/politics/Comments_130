<comment>I don't see how the police are supposed to do their jobs with a bunch of jobless people camping outside their doors.</comment>

<comment>Same thing I say about department stores around black Friday.  Somehow they still manage to get their jobs done.</comment>

<comment>The article didn't say anything about whether or not the activists camping out at the police station were unemployed. Name your sources.I think the police need to release video of the shooting.</comment>

<comment>Releasing the video would probably violate the Government Data Practices Act. (It's an ongoing investigation.) Maybe that law should be changed for situations like this, but for the moment their hands look tied on that point. </comment>

<comment>Releasing video would enable people to invent witness stories.</comment>

<comment>Good call. Waiting to release the video until after all the witness statements come in will make it easier to spot the liars and opportunists.</comment>

<comment>Kinda like how not releasing it allows the cops to lie and cover for each other.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, bad people on both sides. I'd rather deal with police officers than degenerates like Jamar Clark.</comment>

<comment>There are more criminals out there like Jamar Clark than bad cops, and I know how to avoid bad cops: don't be a criminal. Degenerates like Jamar Clark seek out decent people, to take their stuff and cause them harm. I just don't care if things don't go smoothly when people like Jamar Clark end up drawing police attention; better that than they continue degrading our society and endangering others.</comment>

<comment>They have released video footage to those authorities conducting the investigation.  They are under no obligation to release it to anyone else, and what purpose would that serve?  Are there video forensic experts standing outside the precinct asking for it?</comment>

<comment>No, just people who have been lied to one time too many by those same police.  If they really want to start developing some trust once again, they will have to decide how they want to do it. They have their work cut out for them... 1,000 complaints in a year...</comment>

<comment>Because sociopathic enforcers on the street who can kill with impunity by simply saying "I was scared" need to be completely scrutinized and transparent to protect the people who they menace.</comment>

<comment>You're right, professional protesters that go around the nation feigning anger when wife beaters that rush good cops die are employed by definition. If their outrage was real they would be protesting when nice year old children are murdered by gang members retaliating against the child's father--doesn't meet their narrative and takes some peoples minds off the real problem. Cops never joined the force so they could go around killing black males between 14-34, if they wanted to do that, they would be better off not wearing a uniform and just becoming a serial killer since so many murders go unsolved due in large part to lack of cooperation with the police department when it comes time to help solve those murders-the only way it is usually possible to solve is with the help of the community and they remain silent even when children are the victims. It's not cops that are the problem, it's cops that are being made the scapegoats by BLM and those ignorant to the real problems in society today.</comment>

<comment>Educate yourselves and don't believe those who worship the uniform as somehow a symbol of virtue. https://www.youtube.com/watch?...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>When th job is killing people, that should make it easier.</comment>

<comment>They already weren't doing their jobs.</comment>

<comment>They could try to help those in need find appropriate resources. This would provide benifits for the police and citizens.</comment>

<comment>Pretty nasty slur, Bunganasi. So if your community felt threatened, and you chose to exercise your constitutional right to protest, should we make fun of you? This neighborhood is sad; they don't want to have to deal with this sh*t. Personally, I stopped by over the lunch hour and dropped off coffee to the protesters.</comment>

<comment>Good for you!</comment>

<comment>Maybe they'll be kind enough not to burn down your house when things don't go their way.</comment>

<comment>Such an ignorant comment. I hope nothing ever happens to someone in your family.. and they are killed when it didn't need to go that far. Even resisting arrest shouldn't warrant being killed. Not saying this guy was because I don't know the details but even if he was. This is how low you all are becoming.. to think it is ok for these things to happen.</comment>

<comment>I wish people weren't killed resisting arrest, but seeing as how things are in the real world, it's a fool that would test a cop in a pissed-off and scared state of mind. And I wish there weren't grounds for that sort of comment, but it's the damned truth. People were starting to wake up to brutality, until BLM started to make a federal case out of every indefensible criminal bastard who got shot, and turn it into an excuse to loot and burn. Now middle America thinks the cops actually NEED those tanks and assault rifles, and feel they're justified in doing whatever they do.</comment>

<comment>Nobody said it's "OK" to kill a suspect (unless it's justified to protect someone). What people are saying is that BLM long ago abandoned the moral high ground, and now they're protesting the death of someone when *there's no information available,* and that their past protests have more than once gone from protests to riots.I completely support equality under the law (my ex-wife is black), but if BLM showed up in my home city I'd be barricading my door and stocking up on ammo for self defense. Nobody is looting my neighborhood because there was a *slightly* questionable shooting a few towns over.Also, if their demands could stop being entirely ridiculous, that might help.</comment>

<comment>I definitely understand and agree with you Matthew and Lao. I get angry with them when I see something stupid or provoking and think if only they'd just do what they are suppose to do it wouldn't escalate. So, I hear ya. but to me.. the police can do a lot better and need better training. Lives shouldn't be lost like this.. it just shouldn't regardless.</comment>

<comment>We don't know what happened yet but there's a whole organization of protesters out there willing to assume they know the details already.</comment>

<comment>BLM will make up the "facts" as they see fit</comment>

<comment>They will also note who the witnesses are and be sure to give them some 'friendly' advice.  In Ferguson, those witnesses speaking the truth said they would not testify for fear of being killed if the protesters figured out who they were. The lying witnesses lived in the same neighborhood as the honest one.  One person in the protester's turf (who may or may not have been a witness) was executed in his car during daylight. "Nobody saw nothing".</comment>

<comment>And how you're making shit up, anyone can make shit up. You people are so intolerant. You are ok with a police officer killing a person if they didn't have a weapon? I don't know the details of this situation but example? Even if he was resisting arrest.. it's ok to kill the person?</comment>

<comment>Of course it's not "okay," but violent situations tend to escalate-- and sometimes that can lead to ever-more-unfortunate consequences. From what I understand, Mr. Clark was ATTACKING the EMTs who were attempting to aid the girlfriend HE HAD ALREADY BEATEN. What: you think the police showed up and Mr. Clark simply stopped what he was doing and said, "Oh, I'm sorry. Why ever was I behaving like an out-of-control animal? Please allow me to apologize, EMTs, officers, and beat-ee."? Killing people is not "okay," but violence begets violence and violent situations are apt to end-- you guessed it (or not, because I'm thinking you're pretty set in your "beliefs" at this point)-- violently.</comment>

<comment>I understand that.. These officers need better training. They ate killing way to often. It has to stop.. It is taking ones life.. That is the absolute ultimate price.. Taze the fucker.. What happened to the old days when the officers would just throw the persons butt in jail. There needs to be consequences towards officers who pull that trigger. </comment>

<comment>"What happened to the old days when the officers would just throw the persons butt in jail."Everyone is armed now. Of course cops are going to be trigger-happy when the population is trigger-happy. It's a diseased culture that supports escalating violence, and that's what we're doing now. Instead of "oh, guns are a problem, let's deal with that" we go "oh, guns are a problem, let's give the cops bigger guns."</comment>

<comment>Total ignorant projection..Street cops disagree with you..https://www.policeone.com/Gun-...Points 4, 5 and 6 are very telling</comment>

<comment>And the other side will avoid all facts, focus on whatever proof of nothing that trickles through, so they can move on with their black hating lives as they see fit. Difference is, the black people are dying. Meanwhile white people are victims of police misconduct too but they get paid off more often. The people who talk against the black people are just too cowardly to speak up for their own white people who are also going through this to some degree. plain and simple. So they promote this culture giving Cops their approval in any supposed misconduct case. Let's be honest about which Americans in this country support their fellow Americans.</comment>

<comment>Americans support their fellow Americans; some have a broader definition of fellow American than others.</comment>

<comment>did you not read the article?  one of the officers is black.  "black hating life" indeed.</comment>

<comment>And it is the huge numbers of black deaths by cop that is the problem. Nobody said a black cop couldn't kill just as easily as white cop and cover it up. But it is disproportionately black deaths they seem to cover up most often...</comment>

<comment>The disproportionate number for blacks may be more directly related to the disproportionate criminality of blacks.More crime --> more exposure to cops --> more risk of being shot by cops</comment>

<comment>Cops don't patrol the white neighborhoods the way they do the black ones. Cops don't gang up on a white suspects and suddenly feel like their life is indanger and put a bullet between his eyes for good measure. Dylann Roof, white guy, shoots up a church while they are in the middle of praying and cops treat him with kid gloves. Roof is a terrorist!Eric Garner sells cigarettes on a corner and gets choked to death because somehow THAT is life threatening. So yea. Tell that white-people-are -less-criminal bs to someone else.</comment>

<comment>Clearly you are truth impairedAnd Garner wasn't choked to death. He died of heart failure. He was a fat, unhealthy guy who resisted arrest and the stress killed him.But hey.Thanks for the demonstration that you're not only ignorant but a prejudiced bigot at that.</comment>

<comment>He left out that it was a black, female police sgt. in charge of the operation involving Garner.  She was standing right there the whole time.</comment>

<comment>Funny how such details always seem to fall by the wayside..</comment>

<comment>Gravity brought down the WTC. That doesn't mean terrorist flying a plane into it had nothing to do with it. Garner didn't just drop dead.Cops park at the stop sign every single morning near a bus stop where I used to live - scoping for any illegal activity and staring down those kids. Yet I know a 19yo girl who sells weed, molly, and sleeping pills she steals from her dad at the corner hotel near her block. Not a cop in sight. I'll give you one guess what the difference is. Look at the crime stats and it'll show more crime in the hood where the cops are looking for it. Not in the other hood where it is happening.Don't tell me what I don't know.</comment>

<comment>Ronald Reagan described you best..."It's not that our liberal friends are ignorant.It's just that so much of what they know isn't so."</comment>

<comment>Fascinates me how, by attaching a label, some people can think they are better than everyone else.</comment>

<comment>That is the other way around. Republican's are a freakin joke. They are so low on the intellectual totem it is incomprehensible. You people truly need mental help and I say this in all seriousness. Get help.</comment>

<comment>QED...ChildishIt's not me, it's you...</comment>

<comment>Which is what a sociopath with NPD would say.</comment>

<comment>As Sh*tila always says, it's not me, it's not me, it's not me,  it's not me, it's you.  Sounds just like the proverbial broken record.Well, IT is a sociopath with NPD, so that is to be expected.</comment>

<comment>The failure was, in Saint Ronnie being as dumb as he seemed.  Ask James Garner!  The Soviets got this one right.  The rat-wing elected Ray-gun, a busted, failed actor with the IQ of a rock [no, not a box full], to play a cowboy president.  He was definitely an empty suit, and ran the most treasonous and corrupt administration since U.S. Grant.  At least, Grant meant well.  All Raygun was was a talking corpse for those that wanted to corrupt American.  We are still paying for his destructive policies.</comment>

<comment>Heyyyy you are right, it must have been the initial blow that started the events that led to Garners death.. Therefore Garner is at fault. He did something Illegal(initial blow), when confronted by police, who were going to put cuffs on him to bring him to station, He resisted the arrest.(second blow)</comment>

<comment>Yes.. that warrants murder. You are right. SMH</comment>

<comment>Please, dear, check Black's Law Dictionary for the legal definition of "murder." Oh, that's right: said definition "doesn't count" because it was likely written by white people.</comment>

<comment>Facts aren't important to some people.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, those associated with BLM seem to be seriously fact-impaired</comment>

<comment>Coming from someone, no, I can't call you a man for I would be lying, that LIES in every post he produces.</comment>

<comment>LOL! the stress killed him.. what an idiot you are!! IN the video he is yelling at them.. I can't breathe.. I can't breathe..!! while they sat on him.. SO now because he is overweight that gives them an excuse? His life mattered as much as anyone else. You people are the freakin devils I swear.</comment>

<comment>The difference between  Dylan Roof and the others is Roof didn't resist arrest or do anything else stupid.  He didn't come out with guns blazing, didn't fight the officers. He was surrounded and gave himself up.Eric Garner was breaking the law.  To you it may sound menial. Why don't you ask a merchant what it takes, how much it cost them to sell cigarettes.   If you were to see the very fist video that surfaced, before it was edited, all was calm, then Mr Garner saw someone recording (you can see him looking straight into the camera), that's when all hell broke loose.  When they tried to handcuff him he started fighting.  Mr. Garner was not choked to death.  Mr. Garner had several health issues, including obesity, asthma and heart disease which contributed to his death. Illegally selling cigarettes isn't life threatening but a 6'3", 350 pound man fighting, resisting arrest is no picnic in the park either.</comment>

<comment>Roof didn't do anything stupid. sigh. Garner broke the law, not Roof though. Whatever. I'm done. No further questions your honor.</comment>

<comment>No Roof didn't do anything stupid after being confronted by police. Police don't shoot people who aren't committing crime when they arrive. All the people the police have shot, have been doing a crime, then when the cops come, they continue to do more crimes (resisting arrest because going to the police station is sooooo hard) Especially if you haven't done anything wrong, I mean just go to the  station if you haven't done anything wrong.</comment>

<comment>Resisting arrest is wrong.. however, it doesn't and should not ever warrant a death sentence. That sir is the difference.</comment>

<comment>When violent things are happening, people are apt to get hurt. Missed that old lesson ending in "... until someone loses an eye," did you...?</comment>

<comment>You mean like how Joseph Parker assaulted the police but somehow didn't get shot in the head? Ooh oh no that awkward moment when facts reveal your bias.</comment>

<comment>Ohhhh I guess every single solitary situation is the same. Hear that everyone. If one black person gets shot that means every single black person will get shot. Lol you actually amuse me. It's hilarious. Along with  your name you are extremely funny. Um what facts. So you are telling me if one person doesn't get shot that and every single situation like that one person is also not going to get shot. There have been plenty of white people who have been brutalized by police. Actually, more than blacks. The percentage is just higher for black people well because they commit more crimes. Thats not racist it's actually just facts. Since you like facts so much.  </comment>

<comment>According to fbi.gov whites commit way more crimes according to the expanded Homicide Data Table 6, you will see for yourself. Or you can just stop responding so I can stop roasting you. One minute its so obvious why police shot Clark, until its not. Enjoy your holiday, you earned it.</comment>

<comment>Lol when did it say anything about blacks committing more crime than white people. Guess you gotta still go back to school to learn to comprehend sentences. I said blacks commit a higher percentage meaning a higher percent of black people commit crimes than white people. White ppl commit more crimes but there are way more white people than black people.  Among interracial crimes black people commit 85 percent of those crimes. </comment>

<comment>"The percentage is just higher for black people well because they commit more crimes."</comment>

<comment>Yeah they commit more crimes within black people than white people within white people. </comment>

<comment>"White ppl commit more crimes..." Isn't that a problem, tho? Or nah, not really?</comment>

<comment>Nope because there is waaayyy more white people in the USA. You should be concerned that over the majority of black people commit crimes. Thr majority of white people don't. </comment>

<comment>So crime as a whole isn't your concern. It is black people committing crime that bothers you. See, was that so hard to admit? Don't you feel better now just admitting that instead of coming up with justifications and reasons that don't hold water? Proud of you.</comment>

<comment>No.. Are you really too uneducated to understand... I am not concerned with white people because it's a small percentage. I am concerned with black because over half of black people commit crimes. My concern is somebody stopping crime to thr point where the majority of one race doesn't commit crimes. So it's under 50 percent. Crime is going to happen. But why is it that over 50 percent of blacks and other minorities have to commit them. Why do under 50 Percent of whites commit crimes. So I am concerned about blacks committing them because it's such a high percentage. But you are only going to cry racism because you can't allow people to actually try and help you. </comment>

<comment>You want to help the black people? Oh man, just when I thought you were done, you go and make things worse. Sssh. Just log off, cuz how are you gonna last if you actually think the color of a skin has more to do with committing a crime rather than prosecution of the crime?</comment>

<comment>Um I want to stop crime in general. But don't you think if crimes are being done in a certain group of people I would have to focus on that group of people? Why focus on the prosecution, that's the courts job. We won't have to focus on the prosecution if we stop the crimes</comment>

<comment>"Why focus on the prosecution, that's the courts job"  What is a crime? What is the definition of a crime? If Caitlyn Jenner kills someone with her car, but the courts refuse to prosecute, then it isn't a crime. If kill someone with my car, and the courts prosecute, then it IS a crime.The prosecution is everything, except when the police don't act as law ENFORCERS but as civil executioners and prosecute the crime on the street with a bullet. Then that is a big problem for me.Where does the fbi get those stats from? You think they have cameras in everyone's homes and watch people commit crimes and tabulate them equally?</comment>

<comment>Just because YOU declare that: " .. the police don't act as law ENFORCERS but as civil executioners and prosecute the crime on the street with a bullet."Does not make it true.Your spinning and cherry-picked data doesn't make it more true either.</comment>

<comment>"...except when the police don't act as law ENFORCERS..." at least quote me right. #unsubscribe</comment>

<comment>Except, it is true.  Foreign cops are rough.  Very rough at times.  But, few unarmed people are ever shot.  In fact, the UK, Japan, even Germany, have an overall lower per capita murder rate, than OUR COPS do alone.  Our cops kill more unarmed people than those countries have people murdered from all causes.  So, why is that.And denying, will not earn you any brownies.</comment>

<comment>Well I have a frickin' BA, MA in History, and a BSN. And I have understood what you said in exactly the same manner as Kofy has. You are a racist, you don't really understand numbers, but you know that others have used them for obfuscation, so you are going to try that tact as well. And the reason you are having so much trouble is that it may usually work with others, but WE happen to know our facts too. Bummer, isn't it, white boy?</comment>

<comment>Having a bunch of degrees is no guarantee of having an education, or of even knowing anything of value.Nice racist ending to your rant, by the way.</comment>

<comment>This was a reply to Josh, who asked Kofy if he was too uneducated to understand. He is not. Neither am I. He is a racist. You are just condescendingly weird, Attila. You may be racist, too...</comment>

<comment>To a hammer (like you), everything is a nail.</comment>

<comment>Im not white.... Lol....im Puerto Rican. Mom is Puerto Rican and my dad is half white half black </comment>

<comment>DOH !The simple dishonesty of arguing absolute numbers is in the fact that whites outnumber black by multiples.So it would follow that if they are equally criminal, the absolute numbers would be larger.That is why, for a fair comparison, absolute numbers are NOT used, and instead rates are used.Your "boast" is a lieNothing to be proud of.</comment>

<comment>"The percentage is just higher for black people well because they commit more crimes." That is the lie. Don't be mad I called it out.</comment>

<comment>Better look at the disparity of crimes like rape and assaults.Blacks seem to have a much bigger participation in those crimes.Even blacks worry when they are being followed in unafe streets.How did Jesse Jackson put it.“There is nothing more painful to me at this stage in my life than to walk down the street and hear footsteps... then turn around and see somebody white and feel relieved.”Blacks have major cultural issues when it comes to parenting, fatherhood and crime.They three are related.As long as you go around avoiding facing that sad truth and instead spend your time blaming "the man", you will never solve your problems.</comment>

<comment>RACISM just oozes from your pores.Yeah, you do have one point.  Trayvon Martin WAS worried when Zimmerman was following him.  That is why he turned and busted Zipheads ass.  But, the dipsh*t had a gun, so murdering Martin made him a "good guy with a gun."</comment>

<comment>So, since you always must talk about BLACKS, but not about criminals in general, would RACIST be too strong a term for you?I would say LOL, but you are not really funny at all.  Rather sad in a pathetic way.</comment>

<comment>Your racism is a fact.Definitely nothing to be proud of.</comment>

<comment>Can't argue with stupid Kof. They will remain ignorant, sadly.</comment>

<comment>Time to burn that nonsense you just typed out. What about Steven Whitlock who came out guns blazing at firefighters? Why did officers run from Jed Frazier and calmly talk to him when he pulled out? What about Jesse Deflorio who shot at cops? Really, you sound mental, cuz that logic doesn't hold up at all. As a matter of fact, it just exposes your bias. Just come out and say it. It will feel better.</comment>

<comment>Nice cherrypicking. There've been plenty of incidents of cops killing whites in questionable circumstances, and getting off scot-free. You may not want to see it, but the cases are there. I've been following anti-police brutality movements for years now, and they were actually making progress until it got turned into a racial issue, with human scum like Mike Brown being held up as martyrs, with supporters looting, rioting, burning, intimidating witnesses, etc.</comment>

<comment>Whoa... human scum? #unsubscribe.</comment>

<comment>Yup, anyone who decides to attack police officer and steal is scum to me. There are scum who are more scum than others but they are still scum.</comment>

<comment>You ever notice how all the blm people cherry pick? lol And then when you call their "Martyrs" scum they get on you like you just insulted Ghandi or something. I mean, what do you call a criminal who decided to steal, then attack an officer. I mean I think scumbag would be the right word.</comment>

<comment>You mean like how Joseph Houseman flashed his gun and threatened police at a Dairy Queen? Yet he is still alive. Or how Lance Tamayo pulled his gun out on police, yet they spent over an hour trying to talk him down. Why didn't they shoot him in the head? You been doing a poor job of following anti-police brutality Lao. Pooor job.</comment>

<comment>Again, cherrypicking. Are you telling me that cops never refrain from shooting blacks? Please. Just because it's not on the evening news doesn't mean it's not happening.</comment>

<comment>I mostly agree with you but you can't really compare cases because each cop is different. We have good cops that follow the rules and Bad cops that don't. Some areas are a lot more intolerant than others. We need to stop police brutality period.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>"Huge numbers." Mm hm. The cops are out there bulldozing black corpses into pits filled with quicklime every darn day, you bet. Just like abortion clinics are filling millions of Dumpsters with teensy-weensy fetus bits.  Isn't hyperbole a wonderful thing, Betty?</comment>

<comment>A black man is 21 times more likely to be shot by a cop than a white man. Huge.</comment>

<comment>Really ?Show us how you got that number.</comment>

<comment>http://thinkprogress.org/justi...</comment>

<comment>So..How many of those black teenagers were involved with gangs and drugs ?Last time I looked, the numbers for black teenagers were also 5 times more likely to commit murder and 7 times more likely to be murdered.And getting shot by cops would be a natural result from being criminally involved with gangs and drugs..How convenient that the data was not filtered for that..Sounds like the play on statistics when including suicides in with homicides as "gun violence".</comment>

<comment>http://www.washingtontimes.com...</comment>

<comment>2 separate articles but no verifiable source.</comment>

<comment>You got one right wing source, and one left wing source. You were given what you were asked for. You are obviously a wannabee who feels like King behind the Keyboard, plus you're a damned racist on top. I don't deal with your kind any longer than I have to. You have your facts, not that they mean anything to you. You're a very unpleasant person. I hope you gain some happiness from some source other than pinching wings off flies.</comment>

<comment>Is calling someone  "racist" your standard knee-jerk response ?After all that education, that's all you can come up with ?Pretty pathetic..</comment>

<comment>Well said</comment>

<comment>" Meanwhile white people are victims of police misconduct too but they get paid off more often. "Wow. You people come up with some amazingly sound theories to continue your narrative. But see, White people are raised to obey police officers regardless if emotions. And yes there are probably a few cases where police use questionable force against Whites. The difference  is that Whites do not have the desire or the time to hold much concern for our lowest rungs of the societal ladder. If one is that stupid and aggressive to attempt to hit a police officer or METs or their wives or girlfriends, we pretty much do not give a damn and feel safer without them sharing oxygen with us.</comment>

<comment>What's sad is that groups like BLM and people like Al Sharpton contribute to why blacks are among the least educated, least wealthy, least productive, and least innovative demographic groups in the country. The mindset that they promote limits the potential of the black community.In order to progress, you need to be secure enough to tolerate criticism and accept reform. The aforementioned parties refuse to do this, and advocate that others follow their lead. Any attempt at disciplining or punishing individual blacks -- whether it be teacher-student, employer-employee, or cop-criminal -- is met with cries of racism. So blacks are never given the opportunity to learn from their mistakes. The threat of the race card is so pervasive that generally the other side backs down. This creates a sense of entitlement where some blacks think they are immune to the rules everyone else expects to follow. Hence we see them so often resisting when those rules are actually enforced. Well, resisting with armed and paranoid police is sure to create messy situation for anyone.It's all about furthering a victim mentality and the paternalistic idea that blacks have no agency in their own lives. They are apparently just victims of white behavior. At least that's the narrative pushed. There's a reason why BLM protest the rare cases when black criminals are killed by police officers instead of the far more numerous cases where innocent blacks are killed by their own race. It's not about black lives for them, it's about politics. It's about garnering sympathy and special treatment from a society they predict will cave in to their demands.</comment>

<comment>bigot.</comment>

<comment>Malik may be but he is pointing out facts. White people have proved that they are not going to solve the problems engendered by the current culture so black self help is the only answer.Vitriol is not the answer. A well thought out response may have made Malik look bad. Instead you look to be the thoughtless idiot. I wonder if your a student, spending your time worrying about micro aggressions like having to show up to class on time.On the other hand one has to wonder if Malik Isa a child molesting, dishonest, dirt bag like his screen namesake.</comment>

<comment>You are right, vitriol is not the answer...But JUSTICE served in the right amounts is.</comment>

<comment>So, Betty, how do you define "JUSTICE"? Do you have the time, education, experience, and money to tear down the entire legal system and build it from the ground back up? That's right: you don't. Neither do I. I work reading court cases. I'd say I've read some three hundred THOUSAND of them in the past quarter century. And what amazes me-- despite my frustration at the amount of money, time, and what seems like meticulous word-games wasted on people who commit horror after horror-- is how well, in general, the system actually works. For everyone, of every color. You got something better to replace it with? Then let's hear it, honey. Because tearing "the system" down just to tear it down won't fix a thing.</comment>

<comment>And shutting down a privately owned mall which had nothing whatsoever, despite their request that you not, is justice somehow?Demanding racial hiring quotas so that more black people fill university roles (literally racist hiring policies) is justice?Nah. They're ridiculous.</comment>

<comment>So what you mean when you say "let's have an honest conversation about race" is that you actually have no intention on having an honest conversation on race unless the facts that you don't like get omitted.</comment>

<comment>Blacks are the least innovative?  Oh man that's rich... let me go listen to the radio so I can hear all the orginal white music they play nowadays.</comment>

<comment>Gangsta rap doesn't qualify as music</comment>

<comment>You mad cuz ain't no such thing as innovative white music?</comment>

<comment>Really ?You are stupid enough to claim there's no "innovative white music" ?Because naturally, you think music actually has color ?And by the way, I don't buy into the "blacks are the least innovative" nonsense.Innovation has nothing to do with skin melanin content.It has to do with good brain function..</comment>

<comment>Sorry. Forgot about Elvis and Jerry Lee Lewis. So fresh. So unique. Proceed. Rap isn't real music (thats so 90s but ok). Blacks aren't innovative. Blacks are entitled. Dumb and poor. Did I forget anything? Im off to go cash my WIC. If I don't make it back its cuz I saw a cop and resisted arrest for no reason and got shot in the face like I deserve. </comment>

<comment>Being stupid, bigoted with attitude is not good for you..Just makes you look stupid, bigoted with attitude..Try something else.</comment>

<comment>You dont like my attitude? You dont like that I'm stupid and bigoted? If you had a gun would you shoot me?</comment>

<comment>YAWN !...You poor pathetic blowhard.You imagine you're worth the price of a bullet, when a few well-chosen words can do ?</comment>

<comment>If you can show restraint from killing someone you don't know, don't like their attitude, and think they are obtusely stupid... why couldn't they? Oh no! His hands are flailing around - he's clearly going for ma' gun! Better just kill him to be sure.</comment>

<comment>DOH !In the case of police who are facing someone with a history of previous violent behavior, they have ABSOLUTELY NO REASON to presume, that this time, the idiot will behave sensibly and rationally.Instead, the data shows that they can expect the idiot to be as stupid as he was previously.You can try to spin your ignorant shit into straw, or even into gold thread.But all your doing is spinning shit.</comment>

<comment>Cops aren't civil executioners. End of story.</comment>

<comment>Very good..At least you figured out that much...Too bad you tried to imply the opposite at the start of this little exercise.</comment>

<comment>If Sh*tila "implies," then it is a "lie."Guaranteed!</comment>

<comment>EXCEPT, as in Ferguson, the murderer had no idea he was "facing someone with a history of previous violent behavior, . . . .   He just elected to shoot to kill, i.e. murder.  All the fake evidence came in after the fact, and did not amount to a hill of sh*t anyway.</comment>

<comment>You hear innovation and think of only music? What about inventions, medical advancements, scientific discoveries, academic research, art, literature, film, etc.And considering most music nowadays uses white-invented notation, instruments, recording equipment, and distribution channels... I would say yea -- whites are really innovative when it comes to music.That piano, microphone, electric guitar, saxophone, radio, MP3 player, CD player, speaker, etc that is used to make and disseminate music, all comes from white people.  Not to mention they created classical music -- which is probably the most beautiful and complicated music to compose.</comment>

<comment>Great argument and rebuttal.</comment>

<comment>Yeah you pretty much are if not at all, an its no surprisingyou would bring up music what a shocker. that's the only thing blacks seem to bring up and among other things like afro centric crap that they keep spewing out, an last time I check metal and Heavy metal if not classic an country or pop was invented by whiteslike wow how delusional are you and they’er the only race that hasn’t built anything yet whether it be a car, plane, house, building, power plant, phone and cell phone, clothing, rocket, shuttle, satellite, part of the space station, infrastructure, theme parks, carnival, circus, corporation, school, authority system, hardware, army, navy, marines, air force, technician, engineer, farming, CPU manufacturers, GPU manufacturers, Super Computers, Quantum Computers, Game companies Sony & Nintendo, Alcohol beverages hard & soft.</comment>

<comment>Oppressed lol.  You don't know real oppression.  You're delusional.  Blacks in America have a higher standard of living than blacks anywhere else.  That's a fact.  So are you going to bite the hand that feeds you?  Yes blacks were slaves, but so was every other race.  Most major civilizations partook in slavery.  You honestly think blacks are unique in having been slaves and America is unique in having held slaves?  Learn some history.  Black Africans were the ones who introduced Arabs and Europeans of an existing slave trade already going on in Africa.  There is still black slavery going on in Africa right now... yet you're stuck on what happened 150 years ago.By the way, if you think slavery is the reason for America's success, you are showing how ignorant you are.  Again, most societies back then participated in slavery or serfdom.  So why aren't they all as successful as America?  USA did not become a relevant world power until decades after slavery was abolished.  USA's success is mainly rooted in the stability of its government, and the wealth generated from its inventions, corporations, financial institutions, universities, hospitals, charities, high tech infrastructure, and manufacturing base -- none of which black slaves are responsible for. </comment>

<comment>Again well-said.Too bad, that you've locked your privacy setting.Can't follow you when you do that.</comment>

<comment>Going by your logic, couldn't we also say that the Wright brothers deserve no mention or credit in discussions involving modern aviation or to put it simply, all bridges cease to be bridges once they have been crossed.It is okay to feel the need to want to separate the success of the USA from inconvenient truths in history. However, facts remain facts and the truth is slavery's immense contribution in free labour and man hours to the growth of the USA can simply not be discounted. Somebody had to pick that cotton.</comment>

<comment>They know what witnesses saw.</comment>

<comment>No, they know what witnesses claim they saw.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>How so? I don't automatically believe something a lot of random strangers claim. Do you?</comment>

<comment>You mean like the lying witnesses in Ferguson ?<snicker>You are a gullible tool.</comment>

<comment>They didn't have video in that case to corroborate witnesses.  So, they went with assuming the cop didn't lie.They tried that in SC, too, until someone with video posted the true account.  I believe that lying officer is on his way to prison.I guess we will find out who the gullible tool is very soon.  I will say that the fact that the MPD will not release video doesn't bode well for the defense of these officers.  If they had evidence that he wasn't on the ground they would have released it saying the investigation is ongoing, but we're releasing video for transparency....</comment>

<comment>They had forensic evidence in Ferguson to show the witnesses lied.I suspect, it may have been an accidental discharge.In the excitement, the cop has his finger on the trigger.</comment>

<comment>Involuntary manslaughter.</comment>

<comment>"You guys, there's no evidence in this case whatsoever yet... so where are we protesting?"</comment>

<comment>The majority of the article is a hit piece on the MPD. How did Clark die? Well, we don't know, but the police have been accused of a lot over the years. We won't bring up Clark's past because that's not important at all. We only need to discuss the police force's prior alleged misdeeds. </comment>

<comment>You can't really expect equal coverage today. Back when being a journalist meant reporting the facts, that would be a fair expectation, but today's journalism is all about clicks and $$. The Atlantic doing a hit piece on Minneapolis PD draws more viewers than writing a balanced article.</comment>

<comment>Yes, expect a Ta-Nehisi Coates' piece incoming in the near future on how this proves all white people are irredeemable racists to cap things off...</comment>

<comment>Who are these Atlantic readers that have this prescient awareness for detecting hit pieces before reading them? I'd love to meet these individuals to do experiments on them. </comment>

<comment>I suspect many of them believe they've already been probed. "The truth is out there".</comment>

<comment>The "what he did in the past" argument is getting old.  Even this article shows that past performance doesn't guarantee future outcomes: "One officer, Michael Griffin, won a departmental medal of valor for responding to a 2012 shooting, has racked up 19 complaints since 2007. He cost the city more than $400,000 in two brutality cases. In May, Griffin was indicted on federal criminal charges including perjury and police brutality."  If you were to say that based on Griffin's past that he should be given a pass, I call BS.  The main thing that matters is what happened during the particular incident.  A person can be a saint one day and a demon the next, or vice-versa.  One does not excuse nor balance out the other.</comment>

<comment>My point is that they only explore the past alleged indiscretions of the entire police department, but they make no mention of the past indiscretions of the deceased.When they open the door to exploring what the MPD has done in an article related to the shooting, then they need to be fair and include what the deceased did in the past, as well.</comment>

<comment>You miss the whole point. The police as law enforcers  should be expected to be like Caesar's wife. They must not only be innocent but also be above suspicion.</comment>

<comment>It is quite impossible for them to be above suspicion. You are saddling them with an impossible task.</comment>

<comment>Tend to think it should not be impossible to arrive at a position where they are generally trusted do the right thing. It might take some doing, but it should be possible.</comment>

<comment>Most do the right thing. The ones that do not are the ones that make the news. That us such a small percentage of police officers, but we judge them all by the actions of a few. Imagine if every indiscretion that occurred in your profession made national headline news. </comment>

<comment>So the good cops are going to have to go through their own sea change... they are going to have to remember they enforce the law, meaning they tell superiors when they are working with a murderer, or a guy who just gets his rocks off on kicking somebody because he knows he CAN. And the Superiors, chiefs, etc. will have to ACT upon it, instead of shaming the good cop.</comment>

<comment>Well who did that to them?  At this point I do not think the police deserve the benefit of the doubt anymore.  How many videos do we need to see of them cold blooded killing innocent people, people who committed no crime.  How many investigations do we have to watch as they declare that tazing someone to death was totally within policy?  How many people do we have to watch be released from prison because some cop lied on the stand about what happened?It used to be that police got some respect from the population, that time has passed, and it is the police departments that have done this to themselves.</comment>

<comment>It is more than just the police. It is literally impossible for them to stay above suspicion given who they deal with on a daily basis. Layer in the fact that there are thousands upon thousands of LEOs that are humans like you and me; that is they are prone to error. The mistakes of another shape the opinion about the whole.I'm not saying the police can't be in the wrong. It simply doesn't help for us to have unreasonable expectation . </comment>

<comment>Shooting somone in the face is not "prone to error" that's flat out murder. </comment>

<comment>Not necessarilyHere's an example of an accidental discharge that could be quite similar to what may have happened in North Minneapolishttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...Stupid sweeping declarations such as yours are just stupid.</comment>

<comment>No what they need to do is see the evidence so that someone  who is not a cop can determine if all responses were commensurate with the actual threat.</comment>

<comment>They are involving outside investigators. Eventually, more will be released. </comment>

<comment>Outside cops and prosecutors, look away folks there is no self interest here. Why not involve someone who is not part of the law enforcement establishment.</comment>

<comment>When you're talking about investigative resources, the vast majority are either current law enforcement or former law enforcement.</comment>

<comment>What? I'm laughing right now so excuse the typos but... seriously what? Examining past behavior of a cop to establish a pattern of abuse means that you must also examine past behavior of the deceased to establish a pattern of them getting shot in the head? Even if the deceased was a raging maniac in the past has no bearing on weather the behavior administered by the cops was abusive. I can't subdue this man so I will first shoot him between the eyes and see if that does the trick? Nah.</comment>

<comment>They didn't establish past behavior of a cop, but of the entire force. So, you're right. They shouldn't look at the behavior of Clark. They should question the behavior of all black, male, convicted criminals.</comment>

<comment>In which case, the PD having to deal with black individuals in a majority of such situations, past experience and history would clearly affect how they would respond.</comment>

<comment>If one is involved in a struggle, and said struggle involves the presence of a firearm, then one runs the risk of being shot with said firearm. Possibly in the head. Perhaps you can stop "laughing" long enough to understand that.</comment>

<comment>Tell that to Johnny Mount.</comment>

<comment>think about who is complaining..the very people he is trying to arrest, of course the will file a complaint if they think it will get them off.You know the saying behave and the cops will not come.</comment>

<comment>When they first started putting video on cops in Cali, complaints went down drastically.</comment>

<comment>"WCCO took a look at Jamar Clark’s arrest record. We found 10 arrests in Minneapolis since 2009. His crimes range from robbery and aggravated assault to DWI and running from police." So says WCCO.  So do we get to include the thug's past actions as relevant too?</comment>

<comment>OK, let me flip this around, then.  Let's say Bob (a fictional person), is a fine, upstanding, model citizen.  Bob wouldn't even hurt a fly, and helps out his neighbors every chance he can.  One day, Bob gets upset and shoots his wife in cold blood.  By the logic in this thread, Bob should get a pass and not go to jail because in the past, he was a perfect citizen.  While his past actions may affect his sentencing, which they should, they have no bearing on the fact that he shot his wife.  Same in this case, just flip-flopped.  I would prefer to hold off on judging until investigations are done.  I realize that I'm not going to change any minds here, but I get a little tired of reading comments where the poster assumes the role of judge, jury, and executioner with little knowledge of the situation other than a preliminary article.  Oh, and the whole constitutional issue of innocent until proven guilty. . .</comment>

<comment>And the past actions of the MPD, particularly officers that weren't even involved in the shooting, have no bearing on the shooting. Yet, they were included in this article on the shooting.Do you not grasp my point, that they have reported the past of the MPD while completely ignoring the past of the other party? If one has enough bearing to be included, the other does as well.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I do grasp your point. However, you are going on a false equivalency. You are comparing an individual to an organization, both which have different rights and limits. A systemic issue does not equal personal choices.  Secondly, police, by virtue of their role in society and the powers invested in them by the state, MUST be held to a higher standard than average citizens. If you are trying to call this out as unfair reporting, you're in the wrong venue. If you are looking to extract your pound of flesh, well, none of us can help you with that. </comment>

<comment>The organization played no part in his death. Individuals associated with the organization did, which gives the background even less relevance. </comment>

<comment>Read the article all of the way through. There are entire paragraphs devoted to the topic of this being a systemic problem in the MPD. </comment>

<comment>But that presupposes that the two officers involved were influenced by a systemic problem in this instance. We don't know that, just as we don't know if Mr. Clark's prior violence was any indication of how he reacted to those officers.If past performance of other officers in the department is indicative of current performance of these officers, then why would past performance of the deceased not be indicative of his performance that night?If you explore one, you should explore both. Otherwise, your goal is clearly not uncovering truth. </comment>

<comment>Yes, but. With a rap sheet like that, and the state of mind that night, it is pretty believable to think he grabbed the cop's gun.</comment>

<comment>IF a cop shoots an unarmed suspect who's not currently a threat, the guy's past is irrelevant. The issue is whether cops are allowed to just kill people in custody, not whether anyone "deserved" it.</comment>

<comment>If, but we don't know that's what happened. If he attacked the police officers, getting shot was a possible consequence. His criminal record (and what happened immediately prior to his arrest) gives credence to that possibility.We don't know what happened; why only present past transgressions of the MPD? And keep in mind, it isn't even necessarily indiscretions of the arresting officers. </comment>

<comment>That's exactly it. You can't help but feel suspension the moment the police dept refuses to analyze the legality of killing someone in custody and then divert the argument to saying the suspect deserved it.</comment>

<comment>Why would Clarks past be relevant?  </comment>

<comment>It bears as much relevance as the PD's history, which is included in the story. </comment>

<comment> heTThe only issue is what was the appropriate level of response. That has nothing to do with Clark and much to do with the PD'S history.You are conflating two issues, whether Clark was guilty and was the response by the cops appropriate. Neither is connected. Just as there there would be two trials regarding these issues, had Clark not already been given the death penalty, they must be considered sepperatly.In any event the police/prosecutors will soon make you happy by slandering Clark and begin the intimidation of witnesses. </comment>

<comment>The appropriate level of response depends on what they were responding to, which has everything to do with Clark.Despie your ignorant presumption, I would actually like to see justice done. If Mr. Clark was subdued and in custody, he was murdered and deserves justice. If he was fighting for an officer's gun, it's a lot less clear what the proper response was.I think both sides should be presented until there is more clarity around the circumstances in this case. Honestly, if they would separate the article into two stories,  I think that would be more fair. They've prematurely arrived at a narrative.</comment>

<comment>My ignorant presumption is that the issue discussed  in the article is the cops response. The facts presented regarding cops abusing the public in such a manner that tax payers are paying claims is certainly relevant to the discussion.That you resort to invective belies your ability to intelligently discuss anything.</comment>

<comment>"Ignorant presumption" is not invective.</comment>

<comment>Can you throw out some actions that justify shooting an outnumbered suspect in the face?</comment>

<comment>Your statement presumes that it was intentional.Do you KNOW that it was intentional ?Do you know anything at all ?</comment>

<comment>I know you don't shoot someone in the head to make them do anything but die.</comment>

<comment>And again, the unsupported presumption that it was intentional..Think about this, if there is a cop standing by with gun drawn, and a couple of others on top of Clark trying to subdue him, what's left as a target ?His big toe ?Or his head ?And if there is an accidental discharge, what would get hit ?His big toe, or his head ?Try to engage brain and disengage mouth.You'll come across as more intelligent for it.</comment>

<comment>Mali: Armed terrorist storm a ritzy hotel, horrifically shooting at anything that moves. Police arrive and kill them to save lives.France: Armed terrorist unleash multiple attacks, grizzly murdering innocents, around Paris. Police arrive and kill them to save lives.US: Cops have trouble putting an unarmed black man in handcuffs. Police kill him, because why bother?Nah. Can't follow your logic.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for another demonstration that you're a moron..3 disparate and unconnected incidents prove nothing.And you're a moron for even trying to foist that kind of nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Forty-five years ago, my brother's best friend shot my brother in the head in a hunting accident. My brother died. That makes my brother's best friend a murderer-- right, kofy?</comment>

<comment>One action would be the suspect grabbing one of the officer's weapons. Then he would be armed, though would likely be reported as unarmed. If the subject were able to get one of the officer's into some sort of choke hold, that would probably warrant it as well.I think the former is a more likely scenario in this case, but I don't know what happened. It could simply be murder. </comment>

<comment>1) Being outnumbered doesn't mean much. There are lot of situations where being outnumbered doesn't reduce the danger present to those trying to subdue you.A common problem with indivuduals loaded up on certain drugs.2) If the target is fairly well covered by those trying to subdue him, a head shot, could be the only available target.3) Your attempt at cheap emotional appear with your refrain of ".. justify shooting an outnumbered suspect in the face .." is just cheap.</comment>

<comment>According to that logic, it would have been justified to shoot Joseph M. Parker in the head when he assaulted polices officers?</comment>

<comment>What "logic" is that ?You still have to demonstrate that you even ken the meaning of the word.</comment>

<comment>By all three of your points Joseph M. Parker should be dead, or at the very least, the police would be as free to shoot him in the head as they were with Clark.</comment>

<comment>I'm not going to play your stupid cherry-pick anecdotes gameI leave that to fools.</comment>

<comment>BUT, you have been playing that exact game for years now. . . . ROTFLMAO! at a total moron eaten alive by NPD.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, the cherries you pick are already rotten from worms.On the other hand, how can you leave anything to OTHER fools.  You have a lock on that.</comment>

<comment>Okay, WHAT logic is that?  You never explain what that is, because you never show any.  You just snipe with your not so new and improved LIES.</comment>

<comment>For the same reason that it would be relevant if he wanted to buy a gun..Or do you agree that background checks are "irrelevant" ?</comment>

<comment>one thing there is no question about is that an unarmed man was shot in the head by the police</comment>

<comment>That seems pretty clear. </comment>

<comment>He died because he caught a bullet to the head. Somehow the MPD have no desire to subdue a minority suspect without shooting them into submission. edit:spelling</comment>

<comment>And naturally you know this because ???</comment>

<comment>A priori. Otherwise they would have subdued him without shooting him.  Unless you suggest they simply didnt know how.</comment>

<comment>I suggest that you don't know a lot of things.1) That you have NO KNOWLEDGE of the incident to justify your claims. Which makes them pure prejudice2) You have no clue how hard it is to subdue someone who is actively resisting.I would suggest that you stop yammering your prejudice and ignorance, and wait for all the facts to be out.Agitating for a lynch mob is not a smart thing.If there is ANY group in the US who should be averse to a lynch mobs, it should be black people.</comment>

<comment>Nope: just like the minority guy who burned another guy alive in a Dodge Avenger the following week. The police TOTALLY SHOT THE HELL OUT OF HIM--- oh, wait: they didn't. Sweeping generalizations: they're so much fun!</comment>

<comment>There have been reports of St. Clark interfering with paramedics as they attempted to aid the woman he had just beaten. Another champion worthy of BLM.</comment>

<comment>Wait for his 8th grade graduation photo. Once you see that, you know he's innocent.</comment>

<comment>If guilt leads to execution, why didn't the cops shoot Dylann Roof in the head?</comment>

<comment>Hi Kofy.  I see you are a bit more anti-truth that I thought.  I'm sure those cops would have loved to plug Dylan Roof.....but he didn't give them a reason.  He surrendered peacefully and did not fight.  I suspect it's because he is one giant coward....but regardless lesson is even if you are no good cowardly scum....if you don't resist and do comply you don't get shot.  Btw the Charleston cop is in jail.  So is the former state trooper who shot the black man in Columbia.  The only SC cop not in jail is the upstate cop who shot the white teenager sitting in his car.</comment>

<comment>Kofy, honey, please: you're embarrassing yourself with your use of terms. Everyone-- with the exception of your enlightened self, of course-- knows real executions happen only once every decade or so in the USA: it's far more profitable to keep people sitting on death row for as long as possible.</comment>

<comment>He was turning his life around! </comment>

<comment>Why do they still point to Ferguson as an example? It was shown that Brown did attack the cop. That he did NOT have his hands up. And that he was coming back towards the cop when he died.  This sounds a lot like that. It might be a bad shooting, it might not. But I'm willing to bet that half of the so called witnesses didn't actually see anything. And all these demands that tapes be released? Doesn't happen in a possible homicide investigation. Not till the investigation/trial is completed. This is common knowledge. Blocking I 94? Get out the snow plows, they'll move. You have the right to protest. You don't have the right to block highways, bridges, railroads, or access to the police station!</comment>

<comment>Truth is irrelevant. In fact, it's better to rely on lies, because then you can build "Our Truth" from the ground up, and get people used to the idea that the manufactured lies are the "Real Truth".  This goes back at least to Tawana Brawley, and some of the same people are key players.</comment>

<comment>Let's not forget that even the Obama DOJ could not find any evidence of civil right violation or wrong doing either.</comment>

<comment>Yes, they found wrongdoing all over the place. It just wasn't in Brown's case. Half that department is gone because of the findings.</comment>

<comment>Lets also not forget that Ferguson was not really about Brown.  Brown was just the last straw, the turning point.  His guilt or innocence is rather irrelevant.  Have a look at that DOJ report about Ferguson, and look at what the authorities in that town have been doing to people for years.  Brown was just a convenient outlet, a symbol.</comment>

<comment>Ferguson is a good example of a screwed up municipal governmemt and police department.  Michael Brown is a terrible example of supposed police brutality, but if you read the DOJ report it seems like Darren Wilson was one of the few decent cops there.</comment>

<comment>And a half dozen people saw Mike Brown get shot in the back. Or at least they said they did...</comment>

<comment>Also a bunch declared that he had his hands up in surrender..And was shot while downAnd...The list of unreliable agenda driven "witnesses" is long..</comment>

<comment>You need to watch the store video of the prior 10 minutes to his death. He was a kid, ambling around, picked up merchandise, with his head in the phone the whole time. He never got to see his attackers before he was DEAD. In an open carry state, it should be noted. He had every right to be carrying the REAL thing, should he have desired.</comment>

<comment>I believe we're dealing with an idiot who believes that anyone even standing near a gun is automatically a criminal who should be shot on sight.This shooting was one of the most egregious unjustified police shootings, where the police were set up to fail and then proceeded to fail.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You clearly never saw the video. I did, before they took it down.. It was horrific. He threw down the gun and fell to the floor. The instant he saw them he threw it down. So you are flat out lying. The cops rushed him blasting away. There was never a moment he threatened the police.</comment>

<comment>It's ironic that you argue against the very same presumption that you make for the Clark shooting.The only difference is that for Clark your claims are not yet verifiable. But that doesn't seem to stop your own presumptions.</comment>

<comment>No I don't. I dont argue anything for Clark. I argue against the MPD all the way. MPD cops either attemtped to subdue an unarmed suspect or they subdued an unarmed suspect. Either way, the presumption is the same.  Killing was what they felt was the answer.The end result will be the same. Cops will be found not guilty, there will be outrage. Then it will happen again, in another city, and we'll agrue it all over again on another site how blacks are the cause of police tactics. Edit: shooting someone in the face will not get them to subdue. It will make them dead. So either MPD don't know how to subdue a suspect or they didnt want to. Just incase that point wasnt crystal clear.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I need a laugh really quick, so here's a question. Why didn't cops kill the two men who shot up a Walmart in Post Falls, ID?</comment>

<comment>Well according to you, it must have been because of their skin color and NO OTHER FACTOR...Really not point in discussing this issue any further with you.Clearly, you're going to cherry-pick the data and your anecdotes to fit your prejudices..Do look up the correct meaning of prejudice..It clearly applies to you</comment>

<comment>Putting words in my mouth cuz you can't come up with another defense? Just when I thought we were done talking, you jump back in. It is clear by now to all reading these comments that you are talking a clear bias.</comment>

<comment>Maybe you should not confuse imagining with thinking.And when you've figured that out, actually spend some time thinking.I'm not sympathetic to a movement who has a couple of major issues1) using thugs are their martyrs2) trying to polarize the issue into a race issue.3) scapegoating the police4) scapegoating whites.5) playing the victim.You want to whine about bias while shukin' n' jivin' about the hard facts. Don't expect to see much sympathy or agreement.</comment>

<comment>What movement? Do I look like I belong to a movement? Ask about me.You jump in the convo but you still aren't saying anything. Didn't answer the question... your bias is all over the place. Suddenly you don't want to answer? Why cops didn't rush into Walmart, gun down, and kill the two fellas popping off in ID? Maybe cuz it seems ludicrous and excessive? Yea?Yet, when it comes to Crawford, every second and angle he moved gets put under a microscope. "Well, hurmpf, he dropped the gun, but did you see the way his knee twitched? He was probably going for it, and if he went for it, he could potentially kill everything in sight!!" Oh no! Cops gotta be safe, so Crawford had to die. I'm laughing at you right now. That's what I'm doing.</comment>

<comment>Just for the record byrdie..If, as you claim, "the shooters KNEW they had a good a-kicking coming.", then they were justified to used deadly force in their defense.Ooops..DId you miss that part ?And "credible threat" is NOT measured by who has injuries.It's measured by " a reasonable fear of serious injury or death".But hey, you're an ignorant divot after all..But weren't you supposed to be gone ?Your words"The point is, I am just demonstrating a point to YOU. I am a temporary problem, and since I have made my point, I am gone."Apparently you were just lying again...</comment>

<comment>No, THAT WAS THE POINT.  You take a gun and go to a place that you know you want to potentially commit a crime.  A crime happens, . . .   You will be found "guilty as charged" for whatever happened.  It goes down like that everyday.  In many states, all you have to be is present when the people you are with commit the act.Sorry, but your lack of gonads "shot" you in the arse again.</comment>

<comment>That was the same nonsense you've been spouting about Zimmerman.Guess what. A jury disagreed with you and proved your claim bogus</comment>

<comment>NO, a couple of white racists on the jury disagreed with me, but the raw truth is, and this is according to the jurors, they did not have a choice because the law was written to legalize killing black people and the unarmed.  Your sorry sack of liars is very fond of claiming a not guilty verdict is not a verdict of innocence, well, if you had listened, that is exactly what the jurors KNOW happened here.In other words, Zimmerman is not innocent.  He just got away with it the same way as all those criminals you carp about do.  Of course, most the people you carp about aren't even guilty, but just poor or black.  But Zimmerman is guilty, and we will likely hear of his demise at any time.  I really can't fathom why he isn't already dead.  He is a real slow learner.  At least, he has ruined his life for any foreseeable future.  Which, is actually just as good as being in prison.  His misery, and his constant having to look over his shoulder are, as they say, priceless.</comment>

<comment>LOLYou're so full of shit, that your family doesn't want to have pictures with you in it..Who wants to be in a picture next to a turd.</comment>

<comment>Which means, you haven't even got any good lies to tell.  Nothing else.I might add, that every barb you throw fits you better.  Really, to a "T."   You are pathetic.At least, I am not a turd, like you.</comment>

<comment>NO, the jury did not prove any such thing.  They got stuck with a racist, lop-sided law and felt they had no choice.  One juror has publicly stated a wish to do this over.</comment>

<comment>And no, you will cod hugger, I won't be ignoring you.  YOU STIRRED THIS UP, and you will remember that you did for a long time.Now, if you want to quit trolling here, that would remove the problem.  I don't care if you troll the a-hole blogs.  That is not my concern. <snicker, snicker,="" teeheehee=""></comment>

<comment>For the record, you are the racist.  You hold that Zimmerman could shoot an unarmed kid because of what?As well, you are a simple-minded bigot, because you believe the guy with the gun is always good.  Well, that just ain't so.But it does show the depths of depravity you have fallen into, because Zip-head is not a prime example of the ideal American male.  He's a POS, and that is putting it mildly.</comment>

<comment>Poor baby..You're such a hater..And you project all your shortcomings on others..You're so... progressive..</comment>

<comment>The real shame is, like all Teaturds you just lie constantly.  You hate anyone that is not a christian, even though you are certainly not.  You hate anyone that is brown or black.  And your sole occupation is trolling and lying in blogs that have been dead for months.  You never post anything of value.Progressive means trying to improve.  A fascist regressive just wants to cause as much misery as possible.  The "fun" part is, you are letting your sock-puppet handlers screw you as well.</comment>

<comment>Just for the record, shite-byrdIt takes a socialist to make a fascistConservative-libertarians like me, are basically anti-fascist (like you).But hey.This is just par for the course.</comment>

<comment>Not true.  Nationalists are the only fascists.  You won't strong arm law and tactics against those you HATE.  That makes you a textbook fascist.Conservative = fascist, in the USA.Libertardian = fascist, in the USA.You might educate yourself some.  Maybe read a book, and quit watching Stormfront YewTub cartoons that have been faked.  Maybe you two braincells would then have an offspring and you would be up to three.</comment>

<comment>"If you can convince the lowest white man he's better than the best colored man, he won't notice you're picking his pocket. Hell, give him somebody to look down on, and he'll empty his pockets for you." ~  LYNDON B. JOHNSON, 1960, remark to Bill Moyers---This is the truth, and a real shame that you are so stupid you will let them not only pick your pocket, but stick their hand up your rear to make you dance and squirm.  Hate is seductive though, but has no practical value at all.  You might come up out of that stinky closet, and get yourself some fresh air.  Statistically, it is unlikely anyone will pot you off.  In fact, as you are such a waste of skin, why would anyone bother?</comment>

<comment>Yeah, you have so many "shortcomings."  That is why you need so many guns.Bwhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!</comment>

<comment>You project in every post you make.Maybe I should call you IMAX instead!</comment>

<comment>I never said I was leaving.  I said to someone else in that other blog that I was leaving.IF you want to bring that up, then you have acknoledged WHY I came to begin with.  Because you are a lying troll that keeps abusing people with your insults and libel.  AND, you have been doing it in the same dead blog for months.  You really need to find some purpose to life.  Sitting in your stinky closet all day, scared of your own shadow, fingering your guns instead of having a relationship with a live human, is not at all healthy.</comment>

<comment>Why would we think it is authentic?  You goons recut everything.  Even Faux Noise does it regularly.  Why should any source you use be trusted at all?Particularly, you can't even get something that is not created by someone as creepy as yourself.  Brilliant minds may think alike, but Shitila doesn't need to be bothered with the burden of thought.</comment>

<comment>A big difference between us, is I listen and verify, and I form my opinions from those facts.  You, like all your ilk, form your racist opinions first, then you go shopping for like-minded liars to support you.That is one reason I don't even bother to look at youtube "cartoons."  Regardless of how they support, they are nearly always just prattle of those that have an ax to grind.  In other words, of no import.</comment>

<comment>https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Can't you understand plain English?  You post cartoons created by a-holes that think and LIE just like you.  The what is the point?But, keep posting them as it wastes your time.</comment>

<comment>Apparently, no, factually, you are just lying again.  BUT, why would a bunch of guns go right into harms way when they had NO lawful business even being there.  They brought their guns, because they WANTED a confrontation.</comment>

<comment>LOLStupid and ignorant with no shame.That's you  bubMinneapolis Shooting: Blacks Admit They Chased and Attacked Whiteshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the confirmation that you are a useless troll liar.  You did not address my point at all.You think one of your YewTub blurbs proves your point.  It does not.  You still have not addressed the crimeand murder rates in nations that are not overloaded with guns.  You have not addressed that the majority of people killed are completely innocent.  Nor the people killed by their own weapons.  More people are killed with their own guns in fights, than the crimes that are stopped.You are a weakling that needs to finger your gun all the time.  I bet you spend most of your time looking over your shoulder for potential adversaries.  Pure sick paranoid, that is all you are.  Seek help.But,did you ever imagine that the odds are a lot better for the hoodlum that gets you in a weak moment and takes that precious ersatz penis away from you.  AND gives you a  going over with it.  Well, we can forget the metaphors because the odds are in the hoodlums favor, and you won't be walking away.</comment>

<comment>Which everyone has learned by now, is most certainly an edit.  THAT is why it is on YewTub, and why YOU want to post that rot.  LIES are magic with you, but they don't do anything, really.</comment>

<comment>You have done nothing but LIE since you arrived.  That is the simplest description of libel.  Put your own house in order</comment>

<comment>LOLLibel is a very specific lie.That's what you do in just about every comment you post.</comment>

<comment>You have been telling all kinds of lies.  AND, my dear Tilly the Perv, lies are specific.Get a brain, and come out of that closet and get some air.  It's nice out here.</comment>

<comment>So says one of the worst butt-hurt troll whiners the net has seen.  Get your sock puppet controllers fist out of your a**, and you wouldn't hurt so bad.</comment>

<comment>LYING is not thinking.  Sorry, about your rotten luck.The police, though they hate the thought, do not have extra-judicial powers to murder.  Though a few renegades do so.  It is still illegal, and they only get away with it due to telling the right lies and covering up.  Now however, everyone has a cell phone and a camera.  It is hard to hide those dirty deeds.In fact, if lying pricks like you had held the police accountable all along, we would not be having these problems now.  And no, Obama is not at fault for your racism.</comment>

<comment>Yes, and the state terrorists were "scared". That is the low bar that justifies murder by state terrorists.</comment>

<comment>Apparently he beat his girlfriend and then when the ambulance came for her started beating on her again. Not clear what happened when the police stopped him.</comment>

<comment>He sounds like pondscum. They still don't get to decide they want him dead. Even pondscum is supposed to make it to the court alive.</comment>

<comment>That's the theory.But there's not guarantee in "supposed to". Particularly not if the dude does a whole series of stupid things like fighting the police.And the problem with statements like "they want him dead" just demonstrates complete bias.</comment>

<comment>or we'll shoot you in the head?</comment>

<comment>" Griffin assaulted “at least four people while off-duty and after first identifying himself as a police officer."And it turns out that this one was a diversity hire.  </comment>

<comment>So he was beating the crap out of his girlfriend before he met his maker ?  Takes a special kind of man to be an abuser .  Not really sure based on what I've read this was an intentional shooting.</comment>

<comment>It's interesting that in all these cases the panacea is diversity hiring, yet the worst example in this police force you mention is that of a black cop. Has anyone done a study of whether diversity hiring actually reduces incidents of police brutality?</comment>

<comment>Guess we can start with Boston; a federal judge just ruled that their multiple choice test on policies/procedures/methods was "biased" because not enough minorities passed.  So expect some dumber than average cops of all races to be promoted there....</comment>

<comment>White liberals hate themselves so much.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Just injustice. And that we have in spades with the police regarding blacks.</comment>

<comment>"In spades"Is that a joke?Seriously though, I'm genuinely curious... how many unjustified police shootings of black people do you think occur in the US each year? There were 400 plice shootings in 2015, of which 171 were white victims and 100 were black (54 were hispanic). 80% of the victims were armed, so we're down to 80 *potentially* unjustified shootings, of which 20 were *potentially* unjustified shootings of black males (it's just *overwhelmingly* males so I'll throw that in there). 13 of those people (out of the 80) were carrying toy guns. All told, 49 people (of which approximately half were black) were shot when not carrying an apparent weapon. 6 of those were attempting vehicular homicide... so we're down to 43 of all races.Race is far less of a factor when being shot by the police than former convictions and poverty.So... how many of those 20 potentially unjustified shootings do you believe were unjustified? I'd be very surprised, personally, if it were more than 2... and I'd expect the same number of white or hispanic citizens were also victims of unjustified shootings.</comment>

<comment>Black men are three and a half times more likely to be killed by the police than are white (Washington Times).  Black citizens killed by police are TWICE as likely to be unarmed, than the whites (The Guardian). Let us not even get into the number of whites shot in the back. So YES, I am serious, NO, I am not joking. Poverty and its accompanying ills definitely play their part, but that cannot possibly begin to answer for the statistics we see. And which, mind you, until this year were illegal to keep with any specificity.</comment>

<comment>I don't know where you learned your math, but the truth is the government hasn't been keeping categorized, orderly records on the matter because of the Republicans and the NRA.We are just now this year starting -- and that is because WaPo and The Guardian began to do so last year.When working backwards, researchers found dozens of cop shootings which didn't even list the race of the dead or wounded. So be patient, and we will have our numbers soon.</comment>

<comment>LOLWhat a crock trying the scapegoat the Republicans and NRA for the government not keeping recordsAs a matter of, it's a blatant LIEhttps://www.fbi.gov/about-us/c...The numbers are alreardy thereAnd have been part of the FBI-UCR for years.</comment>

<comment>Dude, that is a common event happening now. The NRA has fought the CDC keeping data and researching that data for decades now. They have done it sneaky, they have done it underhanded, and sometimes just right out in the open. This is the first year the CDC will be able to study gun violence. Look it up. And if you are an ER doc, or a sheriff, you'd better learn to fill in all the blanks. They are required, now. I found dozens of articles on it with one google.</comment>

<comment>That claim is absolutely false..And my cite PROVED it false.But hey, you keep believing that nonsense..Meawhile, you can easily check by lookinng up the CDC mortality tables which definitely contain data on firearm deaths and injuries. And have done so for decades.You might want to focus on quality instead quantity.Quantity of cites on Google don't mean much.</comment>

<comment>YOU are absolutely WRONG. Do you trust the Journal of the Medical Assn (JAMA)? http://jama.jamanetwork.com/ar...</comment>

<comment>And quit blaming the messenger.</comment>

<comment>Better read up on the history of the shill.. uh.. messenger you're talking about..Then use some carbolic soap afterwords.</comment>

<comment>And you are just angry because you are wrong. Oh, and by the way, Google brings up JAMA.</comment>

<comment>Why should I be angry ?The world is full of idiotsAnd the world is full of shillsThat's like getting angry at cow shit on a dairy farm..This is an expose of a typical Hemmenway studyhttp://www.americas1stfreedom.....Instead if doing appeals to authority.Do some fact checking.</comment>

<comment>Take a hairy-assed wild guess who was the author of those propaganda pieces masquerading as scientific research who which the CDC had to apoligize to Congress and as punishment got the unit producing the said propaganda defunded...The name starts with a K..And this is him still whining about it years later..Go read the Congressional record for the truth, not the bullshit by the guy who caused it.</comment>

<comment>It's "funny" how journalists CELEBRATE when police kill a black man, but don't even report color when a black man kills someone...</comment>

<comment>If that's what you see on the news, get a real news source, not an "entertainment" news source.</comment>

<comment>That may be because the police are supposed to protect people, not kill them.</comment>

<comment>Police are not civil executioners. There is really no further comment I otherwise on it.</comment>

<comment>Still flapping your lips and proving your bigotry and ignorance.Get rid of the 'tude, dude.You'll be much better for it.</comment>

<comment>So the cops should have stood by while he finished beating her to death in the ambulance....then charge him with murder?  Ok then.......</comment>
