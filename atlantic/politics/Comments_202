<comment>ISIS killed Paul's chance of heading the ticket of a newly more bellicose GOP. Candidates need luck in timing their campaigns. They can guess at where the electorate will be two years from when they decide to run, but they can't control events.</comment>

<comment>Rand shot himself in the foot:1. He tried to be more bellicose and failed because the GOP didn't take him seriously.2. His libertarian support started to hate him because Rand flip-flopped on ISIS at least twice due to his drive to be more bellicose.That being said, I think Rand's isolationism isn't realistic in itself and his support of Arab dictators being the paragon of stability doesn't make sense after Arab Spring.</comment>

<comment>Paul never had good numbers.  I don't think he's very likeable</comment>

<comment>Then a Cruz/Paul ticket would be ideal for the unlikable base voter.</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul has never been an isolationist.  That is a canard and a lie that they started in 2008 against Ron Paul in order to paint a false picture that would make people reject him.  It is frankly a shame that people are so gullible, but that does explain the rise of Trump.</comment>

<comment>isn't Paul more like non-interventionist rather than isolationist?</comment>

<comment>That is correct.  Rand (like Ron before him) wants to engage FULLY with the world, in every way except militarism, and only confine actual military action to proper Congressional Declarations of War or Marque and Reprisal, as our Constitution requires.</comment>

<comment>Excellent analysis, Rand isn't an Isolationist, there are circumstance in which Rand would go to Congress and ask for a declaration of war. But Rand respects the Constitutional process.</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul is an isolationist. He wants to withdraw militarily from the world and abandon our allies. He wants the US to withdraw from the United Nations. And recently, he proposed banning visitors from 35 nations. Still, he's not as much of an isolationist as his father.</comment>

<comment>Wanting to obey the Constitution and only bomb countries when we declare war on them is not "isolationism."  You have been fed a lie, and you have eaten it up.  Rand wants to engage with the world more than even Trump does.  Trump is more of an isolationist than Rand.  Either your perception has been distorted by mass media madness, or you do not comprehend the definition of isolationism.</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul is more pro-diplomacy than any other candidate on the stage.  Every single Republican Candidate in the race today is more of an isolationist than Rand Paul.</comment>

<comment>According to Rand Paul, his Republican opponents are all a bunch of neo-cons. How can they be isolationists and neo-cons at the same time? I guess one of you is wrong. If not you, then Rand Paul.</comment>

<comment>You do know that one can be a militarist neocon and a diplomatic isolationist, right?</comment>

<comment>well played, for what it's worth. </comment>

<comment>I must say that I agree.  He shows more diplomacy than any other candidate on that stage.   If I was a Republican, I would vote for him because of his diplomacy.</comment>

<comment>Sadly I fear the voters have become emotional infantile ignorant blithering idiots, and we'll end up with that fascist despot Trump.  :-(</comment>

<comment>I loved his dad. Rand hurt him self by joining the are RNC stooges as a point man on Trump. ISIS is a Bush / Obama Muslim Brotherhood creation working with the [new] islamic CIA. Hence the term isil, standing for Islamic States of Lavent caliphate. I like Rand, but he would have done better if he had not carried the RINO water. I agree with him on many issues, Obama codified NDAA, and they are being used to spy on US citiens, Congress and not Muslims terrorst, in fact there 72 Muslim Brotherhood member in DHLS, as they are in the and running the whitehouse, the Saudis paid 25 million to Harvard Law via a man named Khald al-Mansour, getting Obama into that school.  You must understand what the end game is and Paul Ryan et,al agreed to bring in and to grant 300,000 Miliki type visas . Alabama, as do many states , have Islamic terrorist training camps, 42 camps now in the USA. Watch the "opening gates video invasion of Germany and Europe and how helpless their governments have made their own citizens. if you go through this and do not understand after this, there is nothing else I can say or do.  this is absolute evidence of the uniting of Sunni and Shiite,  Turkey is a major player,  as are the  Saudi Arabians, Obama is in the middle this,it is the reason he will move to Dubal.   They are the ones who funded and gave massive grants to Harvard  to make sure  Obama got in it was  on law review  but never wrote an article. Khalid al Mansour advisor to Saudi Royal Family that advocated murder of white people. Assisted Obama in the funding of his Harvard Law school andin getting in. That is one of the major reason his records are sealed. But the money trail is clear as to the timing of the funding.Look at the Marion, AL Isiamic terrorist training camp and what Scottland Yard has to say what is happening there, it is called ground zero for world class jihadist killers. Because our Marines were assisting Kards against Isis, Turkish Downing Of US Marine Helicopters Killing 12 American Soldiers Stuns Russia and because of Arms being sent to terrorist in exchange for "donations' to the Clinton Foundation, the Hillary State Department sent them arms at tapayer expense.

<comment>Yeah. like building a wall around the Country, or ban Muslims from coming to the USA right? Yea it's a noun, you are a genius, thank for explaining that to us Glen Bradley..</comment>

<comment>You are quite welcome.  :-)</comment>

<comment>That isn't what isolationism means. Not even close.Isolationism is stopping immigration and emigration, closing off trade, ending communication and relations.</comment>

<comment>Watch, he's typing up a response even now.  He's already demonstrated that he simply won't care that the truth is on your side.</comment>

<comment>I'd rather wait to see the actual reply before I critique it.</comment>

<comment>Voila.</comment>

<comment>Does thunder, lightning, and 99.9999999% humidity qualify as 'rainy conditions'? Most would agree: "it looks like rain."</comment>

<comment>Except Rand's stance isn't isolationism nor is it even 50% isolationism let alone the 9.99999999% you imply it is.Would you call your neighbor an isolationist if he invited you over for a pool party, came to your bbq, said hi whenever you passed and engaged in chit chat, hired your kid to mow your lawn but what he didn't do is shoot fireworks into your backyard?I ask because that is exactly what you're saying is how you define an isolationist.  "Someone who isn't ok with random acts of violence in an area that doesn't belong to them but interacts normally other than that."</comment>

<comment>Not true. He does not propose abandoning NATO or its obligations. He does not propose the U.S. withdrawing from the U.N. While he has proposed temporarily suspending certain visas from countries which export terrorism (a milder version of Trump's Muslim ban), he is for increased trade and immigration from every other country in the world. That's not isolationism.</comment>

<comment>You call Saudi Arabia an "ally" they may smile to our face but they are stabbing us in the back while doing it. A lot of our so called allies are not such good friends.Qatar may let us build bases on their territory but do they share our core values? Hell no, Qatar had a huge role in creating ISIS by funding Radical Sunni Salaifist militant groups who coalesced into ISIS, Nusra and other radical groups.I served in Afghanistan and I would guess from your username you served in either Iraq or Afghanistan. In 14 years of war what do we have to show for it? An Iraq more closely aligned with Iran? An Afghanistan where women instead of being executed for being raped or running away from abusive husbands are thrown in jail and told they are criminals.Brass and the political class has seriously screwed up. We've compromised too much of our values, and we shouldn't send young Americans to fight and die in religious civil war between Radical Sunni Wahabbi militants and Iranian mullah backed dictators (Assad) and Shia (Terrorists). And risk Nuclear war with Russia in the process?That's insane. We have to take a step back and ask ourselves what is in our interests and what can we realistically achieve. I know when I signed up to serve in a time of war that I believed the war I would be fighting was to expand American values that all people are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights.That after 9/11 we had a moral mandate to to transform the country in order to ensure it would never again be a safe haven for terrorists to plot and organize with impunity to kill Americans. That was the mission as I understood it.</comment>

<comment>UN is a joke anyway and so what if we withdraw.  Its not like any coutnry we are in does not have their own military.</comment>

<comment>That said, I think your use of the term "isolationism" to describe Paul's views shows you lack either the good will or the understanding to criticize them.</comment>

<comment>Isolationism implies cutting off all contact with other countries including trade. I don't recall him ever proposing that.</comment>

<comment>Paul is not an isolationist. That word doesn't mean what you think it does. He is a non-interventionist. Paul falls along the lines of Thomas Jefferson, as it pertains to foreign affairs, as Jefferson believed in "Peace, commerce and honest friendship with all nations; entangling alliances with none." North Korea is isolationist, Switzerland is non-interventionist. North Korea's foreign affairs aren't so peachy; Switzerland's are just fine. That's because non-interventionists believe in staying out of other people's business, but maintaining good relationships with the other countries. Isolationists believe in staying out of other people's business, and cutting off all relationships with the other countries.</comment>

<comment>His view on military intervention is,,, we should not go to war without congressional approval. That's the Constitution.. If people prefer violating the Constitution and empire building, then Rand is not their man.</comment>

<comment>What about Obama, Bush, Bush, Clinton and Reagan's support of Arab dictators...namely SAUDI ARABIA??</comment>

<comment>I actually would think the opposite, ISIS should only help Paul.  At a time when the current president (and those on the stage at the debate) want to run into a war more now then ever, take away our liberties in the name of security, and preach fear and never ending interventionism adding more debt and spreading our already thin military even further how could it not?  This is despite forcing refugees whom we all know will be infiltrated by terrorists down our throats and Rand Paul is the only candidate whom has done more then talk and submitted a bill for immediately halting all immigration/refugee/asylum seekers without proper background searches.  This reason (and many others like not arming the allies of ISIS in the name of democratic nation building/regime change) is why Rand Paul stood out as the only candidate that seemed a reasonable choice for the job of president at the debate.</comment>

<comment>RAND PAUL was the one who voted against arming ISIS to begin with, while the rest of these assholes funded and armed them. if we followed RAND PAUL'S foreign policy, there would be no ISIS! that should be even more reason to support RAND PAUL.</comment>

<comment>"Rand Paul 2016: Because everyone else’s foreign policy is terrifying."Perfectly sums up my feelings about the GOP field. And Hillary, to be honest. I believe that domestic issues are more important right now, except I have to factor foreign policy into the mix more because so many candidates are dangerous in that realm. Somehow, because of all of the terrifying things said by candidates, my favorite two are Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul, who in many ways could not be more ideologically different. But I know they don't want snooping security state or WWIII.I would love to hear these candidates explain how we will replace the power vacuum left by Assad. I would like to know the exit strategy they would use after we put boots on the ground. And then I would ask them to explain how any of that strategizing would have worked in the cases of Iraq and Libya. While hooked up to a polygraph.</comment>

<comment>I fully agree.  Hillary is as bad or worse than many of the war-mongering neocons on the stage, and we have her years as Sec of State to prove it.  Only Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul will protect our constitutional rights to privacy as citizens, and only they will be reasonable about who to go to war with and when.  Both have had similar stances against croney-Capitalism and sold out politicians (though neither have a perfect record in Congress).  These three issues are my hills to die on, and only these two are mostly right on these issues.  Then it comes down to what you believe about economics, and whether capitalism or socialism will benefit more people.  I tend to favor the former, absent of government-corporation croneyism, and feel that Rand Paul's attacks on the federal reserve system and how it creates inequality in America are spot-on.  Sadly, neither is likely to win the nomination (less so, Rand), so America will be in a very scary place come 2017.</comment>

<comment>You agree so much with what I have been thinking and posting that I could have written most of your post. However, even though I am a fiscal conservative, I have been oddly leaning toward the socialist in this campaign (having voted for Rand's dad in several previous elections). Rand has compromised his position so many times that his libertarian views are hard to hear among the political garbage. On the other hand, Rand has clarified his approach to foreign policy concerns more to my satisfaction than Bernie has. I would like Bernie to weigh in more on specifics of how he would deal with international conflicts. He is so much more comfortable talking about domestic issues that his foreign policy is a whisper at best. For these reasons, I may indeed have to back the Paul once again.</comment>

<comment>Actually Bernie has said some things about foreign policy.  He has said that the Iraq War was the worst foreign policy decision in many years if not in our entire history and is proud that he voted against it.  He also said in passing that he did support going in to Afghanistan but did not say why.  It could be that he voted that way because Osama who did attack this country was there, but we don't know for sure.Both Bernie and Rand (like his father) are exemplary on civil liberties and on keeping us from being involved in unnecessary wars by which I mean where we are not in danger.  Where they differ is on domestic policy.  I fear Rand as a libertarian will dismantle the safety net, Social Security, Medicare and regulation of air and water as government intrusion so I prefer Bernie.  Also Bernie has a better chance of being nominated with more than 10 times the support of the Democrats that Rand has among the Republicans.  I cannot see now any circumstances under which I could support any of the other Republican candidates or Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Spot on. But Bernie is not surging. I will vote for him in the primary, and Hillary in the general, because I want Bernie but will settle for Hillary to stop Trump or Cruz or Rubio...</comment>

<comment>Thanks but with regard to your last sentence you are probably too young to remember 1964.  Art Buchwald wrote a column the next year I believe to the effect "It's great that we didn't elect Barry Goldwater or we'd be fighting in Viet Nam."  That summarized my feelings exactly and I fear what we'll get if we elect Hillary over one of the Republican candidates.</comment>

<comment>I was 2 years old in 1964 but I'm a student of history. I do see your point, but as close as she is to being a Neocon, she has not advocated carpet bombing, or killing the families of the terrorists, or any of the other over-the-top warmongering I hear from nearly all of the Rebublicans (Rand the sole exception).</comment>

<comment>forget that man Bernie is coming up now.   Why settle for Hilary? She has way too many issues to beat any of those guys.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I agree with you. Actually, Bernie does have a shot at winning this thing, so it's Bernie all the way...</comment>

<comment>On pretty much every domestic policy however he's awful</comment>

<comment>True, I don't know how Hillary plans to pay for all of her domestic proposal if we get into a full blown war with Russia because we shot down their jets. I think she is thinking  she can turn this into a repeat of Kosovo. But Vlad Putin is no Boris Yeltsin and if she is calculating that the Russians would blink she may well start a third world war.</comment>

<comment>Although true, there is a serious mismatch in the priority the two place on it.  It's arguably Paul's first issue, but it's certainly not Bernie's first issue.  So I'd trust Paul to do more on it than Bernie.</comment>

<comment>This is a followup to my point above.Paul is most identified with ramping down the terror state - he filibustered over drones, he filibustered over warrantless surveillance, he sued over surveillance, and in general he's tried to identify himself as the premier opponent of unchecked authoritarianism in the name of fighting terror.Whereas Bernie devotes 90% of his time to talking about issues related to inequality, wealth, business, unions, and the middle class.  He speaks passionately about those issues and steers every conversation toward them.  He has traditional Old Left views about de-escalating war and the military state, but when he jumps into office he will not see these as his first priority, nor his tenth.  Best case scenario is that he shuts down warfare and surveillance simply as a cost-cutting move to pay for Danish social spending.Obama also promised to be transparent and to significantly ratchet down the surveillance state and to close Gitmo, but once in office he mostly made things much worse on both those fronts.  Bush promised a humble foreign policy without nation-building, then in office decided that he must wield a mighty army to remake Arabs in his image.  Presidents shift in office, so unless an issue is centrally defining to their coalition or their candidacy, we must be wary about their fidelity to it.  Warfare and surveillance are close to the heart of the government, so any president trying to rein them in will have to push hard.  Whereas a president who accepts most of the surveillance state will have much more time to focus on other agenda items.</comment>

<comment>True, but Sanders was the only Senator to vote against the Patriot Act's initial authorization.</comment>

<comment>Not sure I understand.  Bernie was in the House in 2001, where he voted against the Patriot Act with like 5 dozen other Representatives.  Russ Feingold was the only Senator in 2001 to vote against it.Are you saying that Bernie is the only current Senator who voted against the bill in 2001?I agree Bernie is a critic of the surveillance state, whereas Hillary is a fan of it.  I just worry that he will make it a lower priority if he ever gets close to the White House.  He's already got issues like police reform (Black Lives Matter) and campaign reform (Lessig) tugging at him to give primacy to every star in the progressive constellation.</comment>

<comment>Just because he mentions it less does not mean that it is not an equal priority.</comment>

<comment>I have to re-check my sources. Must not have been the initial law.</comment>

<comment>The quoted sections were both pragmatic and principled.That, alone, ought to ensure his defeat.</comment>

<comment>It is weird that after 15 years of constant war, a candidate that urges caution can't get much traction in either party.</comment>

<comment>You want to know why?All volunteer army.I realize that this is a simplistic and provocative statement--of course I wanted that, otherwise no one reads my stuff, let alone responds--but all hyperbole aside, let me explain briefly.I was of draft age during Vietnam. The very existence of the draft acted as the "control rods" for the US foreign policy of the era.</comment>

<comment>This is incorrect. His father espoused the same views and got double the donations from Military personnel than ALL other candidates combined in 2012.  We don't mind fighting a war, as long as it is just.  These wars are both undeclared and illegal.</comment>

<comment>"This is incorrect."What, specifically in my comment, is incorrect?"His father espoused the same views and got double the donations from Military personnel than ALL other candidates combined in 2012."Since I mentioned no individuals in my comment, who exactly, do you mean when you say "his", and "father"?Again, all I expressed was tat in my view the reason we seem to so casually engage in protracted warfare is the lack of non-volunteers in the armed services.Perhaps your response was intended for another comment than mine?</comment>

<comment>shinynewtoken referenced Rand Paul as the candidate that can't get traction.  Your answer was because we have an "All volunteer Army", as if when someone volunteers for the military they are automatically a warmonger.  Your contention is apparently that if we had a draft, or some other form of conscription that the war would be less popular. Your example, Vietnam, both had a draft, and was extremely unpopular, yet it still drug on for years.  My point, was that the men and women of our armed services, and our veterans, myself being one, overwhelmingly support a non interventionist foreign policy.  The fact the we aren't forced to be there, is irrelevant.  The reason we engage in "protracted", read illegal, warfare is simple.  Control.  It serves to control foreign nations, as well as the citizens of this nation.  Bomb them over there, strip them of their liberty and privacy here.</comment>

<comment>"...when someone volunteers for the military they are automatically a warmonger."Nope, not exactly, and perhaps you missed this:GlenBradley wrote (to you):and I responded to GlenBradly:So you see, James, it's not so much what the all volunteer army does or doesn't do (they'll follow orders, one would think--after all, they accepted this idea when they signed up, right?), it's that anyone who absolutely, positively does not want to : a) be in the armed forces; and b) be both forced into the service AND into this war, will NOT raise a ruckus. They'll never be directly involved against their will, nor have a relative/friend directly involved, against their will.And the why is obvious. I assume that the volunteers know what they are doing when they sign up, and are subsequently ordered to a combat zone, where they might get killed. You're an informed and intelligent adult, right? You chose a course where you just might get killed doing a dangerous job that you agreed needed to be done, and trusted leadership to not waste your life. That's *why* you signed up, right? If you get killed/maimed, it was a result of your conscious decision to join. This cannot be said for draftees.So when volunteers get shipped home in boxes, people are sad, but not enraged, like they were during the draft in VN. They'd think "Not only did he not want to be in this war, he never even wanted to be in a position to be ordered around by military decision makers.""Your example, Vietnam, both had a draft, and was extremely unpopular, yet it still drug on for years."But was under increasingly violent public opposition to the point that one president did not seek re-election, and ultimately the war ended because of massive public pressure.And it was shorter than the current combined Iraqi/Afghan conflicts. Do you think you see any similar organized and increasingly forceful and focus opposition to this war?Me, I don't.Do you?</comment>

<comment>I think you misread his point here.  He wasn't saying that volunteer soldiers want war, he was saying that regular voters and politicians don't care because they don't have skin in the game.</comment>

<comment>Yep. I wasn't clear enough.Thanks!</comment>

<comment>You were plenty clear.</comment>

<comment>The draft was done away with because American voters were sick of it, thanks in no small part to Vietnam. </comment>

<comment>I ended up enlisting in the US Marines instead of waiting until I went to college and become an officer, in large part because I found the entire concept of a draft repugnant and did not want to sign up for selective service.</comment>

<comment>Thank you for the service.  But I feel like what you are referring to is more like universal conscription such as in Switzerland or Israel.  Things really weren't that much different here when the draft was in place-exemption could be had for any number of reasons.</comment>

<comment>Frankly, I think I'd find obtaining an exemption from the draft just as unconscionable as the draft itself. :-p</comment>

<comment>I agree.  But that's why I say you're statement about "everyone having skin in the game" sounds more like universal conscription than the draft.</comment>

<comment>When everyone is subject to the draft, ANYONE could get called, thus everyone has skin in the game, and therefore wars are less popular.</comment>

<comment>I reiterate: with a draft, it is not "everyone has skin in the game."  Its just pulling names out of a hat, and exemptions can be had for any number of reasons.</comment>

<comment>If you were in danger of being pulled out of a hat, then you would probably be a bit less enthusiastic for war.</comment>

<comment>Theoretically that is true, but in practice the privileged get deferments, and the poor go to die.  Anyone with a voice that is listened to, gets taken care of.  Everyone from Bill Clinton to O.J. they all get out. http://www.nndb.com/event/806/...</comment>

<comment>That doesn't change the fact that the existence of an active draft has a dramatic affect on political will to war, which was his entire point.</comment>

<comment>I get that.  I just don't agree.  Even with a draft, politicians just get deferments for their family, anyone connected enough to matter gets out of it anyways.  All they really need to do is continue to destroy the middle class.  That has proven to be much more effective for military recruiting than the draft ever was.</comment>

<comment>Sure, the cowardly rich get deferments, but under a draft a whoooole bunch of people who do not even want to be in the military, are sent into combat -- in the infantry.  This affects political will, even if the privileged children of politicians are not affected.  If it did NOT, then there would never have been protests against the draft, the burning of draft cards etc.</comment>

<comment>yes.  Ironically, should one of these insane Republicans OR Clinton become president, we may very shortly find ourselves in the position to need a draft again.  We have forgotten that the cost of military recklessness is not only paid in expensive military contracts, but in young mens' lives.</comment>

<comment>Not to worry about a draft.Now women would be drafted, and would be sent home in flag-draped aluminum boxes in the belly of a Globemaster, row-upon-row.I realize that the female soldiers are OK with this--they are just as courageous and dedicated as the males--but the rest of the country will collectively soil themselves.</comment>

<comment>Very cool theory.  I'll have to think about it to see if I agree, but you get a huge amount of credit for something new and possibly relevant.</comment>

<comment>This is spot on.  It's not too hard to support a war when you are not involved.  I promise you that if the US instituted a mandatory draft, we would become a nation of isolationist overnight.</comment>

<comment>Good article! But come on, his many flaws? Nobody is perfect but I'd say he has very few. What exactly are his flaws?</comment>

<comment>Besides his insufferable arrogance, dishonesty, and his history of associations with white nationalists, neo-Confederates, and assorted crack-pot libertaryans -- he's awfully thin-skinned and petty. Almost as thin-skinned and petty as his followers (no one is as thin-skinned and petty as Paullowers.)</comment>

<comment>Frankly that kind of sounds like projection to me.</comment>

<comment>Yes, in the absence of actual fact people resort to name calling and half truths.  "insufferable arrogance", I think Donald J. has the monopoly on that.</comment>

<comment>PSO  You see what you want to see.  Rand is much like his father; intelligent, pugnacious and principled.  None of these qualities appeal to the media because there is no story.  Neither Paul is even remotely rascist and to claim otherwise is to say you know nothing about them.  Don't swallow the crap pushed by pundits and media - educate yourself.IMHO Rand Paul has the best ideas of any GOP or Dem candidate.  He also is running one of the worst campaigns.  I live in NH and he gets my vote no matter what.</comment>

<comment>I think he runs a good campaign, in that he's always said he's in it for the long run. For moths now the media has been trying to predict his dropping out, but regardless of them being wrong for months, people eat it up.</comment>

<comment>IMHO letting the media hijack the narrative is part of the problem.  Taking 4 months to settle on a consistent message has to be another problem.</comment>

<comment>it doesn't help that tons of his "principles" are awful and dumb</comment>

<comment>Name calling aside, Rand Paul (along with Bernie Sanders) is one of the only politicians of EITHER party to openly confront the School to Prison pipeline and the way that our nation's justice system is designed to systematically target and incarcerate minorities.  That doesn't sound much like a white nationalist neoConfederate to me.</comment>

<comment>complete fabrication</comment>

<comment>By "history of associations with white nationalists, neo-Confederates and assorted crack-port libertaryans" I'm guessing you mean one Jack Hunter. You liberty-haters can't get enough mileage out of that guy, can you?</comment>

<comment>He has said that blacks could be excluded from restaurants by the owners on the basis of property rights. He has said that he would be OK with a police drone killing a robbery suspect seen leaving the scene of a crime.He has said that people listening to seditious speeches should be thrown in jail.He called for the expulsion of students on visas from Muslim countries after the Boston marathon bombing.I'm not sure if CF considers these flaws, I've asked him but he hasn't replied.</comment>

<comment>I am pretty sure you made up all of this.  I have been following Paul for years and I have never heard of any of this.  Why not just tell the truth, or, cite your sources.</comment>

<comment>OK:[ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v...PAUL: I’m not for profiling people on the color of their skin, or on their religion [he is now], but I would take into account where they’ve been traveling and perhaps, you might have to indirectly take into account whether or not they’ve been going to radical political speeches by religious leaders. It wouldn’t be that they are Islamic. But if someone is attending speeches from someone who is promoting the violent overthrow of our government, that’s really an offense that we should be going after — they should be deported or put in prison.http://www.forbes.com/sites/ri...“I’ve never argued against any technology being used when you have an imminent threat, an active crime going on.

<comment>LOL see?  This is what batshirt insane gets you.  Reading plain English 180° out of what it actually means in order to justify a prejudice.</comment>

<comment>The information you provided is true but sound bytes are ok for sports but not if  you are trying to learn what someone means by the words they say. Now one can just read or listen to the edited sound bytes and article and not even take the time to listen to any speeches or actions the person has taken to fully explain what he means. Or that same person can read other comments or articles and just regurgitate what others say. The responsible thing to do is learn what the person actually says in complete accuracy during speeches, actions and writings instead of sound bytes and edited articles. What amazes me the most is people do this often and then wonder why nothing ever changes. instead of taking the time to post maybe you should take the time and learn the laws of this country and then match it to all the candidates platforms. You will probably find that Rand Paul is the only candidate that is consistent in upholding the Constitution and being true to Americans. In the civil rights article read his response and you should be able to get an idea of what he stands for. Unless of course you want to hurt him and have no problem spreading propaganda instead of truth.</comment>

<comment>It is opposite day.  Rand Paul is one of the only people in the government who actually opposes use of drones for surveillance (without a warrant) and routine police security.  The only exception would be to stop a LETHAL (not robbery) criminal or terrorist in progress of the crime.  Such as to take out a mass shooter.  The same exact situations that a cop can use any other lethal force.  His words: “My comments last night left the mistaken impression that my position on drones had changed. Let me be clear: it has not. Armed drones should not be used in normal crime situations. They only may only be considered in extraordinary, lethal situations where there is an ongoing, imminent threat. I described that scenario previously during my Senate filibuster. Additionally, surveillance drones should only be used with warrants and specific targets. Fighting terrorism and capturing terrorists must be done while preserving our constitutional protections. This was demonstrated last week in Boston. As we all seek to prevent future tragedies, we must continue to bear this in mind.”</comment>

<comment>Killing a robbery suspect from a drone in the scenario RP gave  is just the sort of thing that counts as improper use of force. No threat to life was described in it. He gave the example then walked it back. He is OK with armed police drones used in the general run of crime that police now face on foot. Are you? Is that the libertarian position on domestic police drones?</comment>

<comment>I admit this turned me off of Paul for minute, but that was a very long time ago. On the biggest issues of our day (war, criminal justice reform, anti-spying, Bill of Rights protection, and medical marijuana) he is right on. With anything, no one candidate is gonna be across the board on everything. Rand is as good as it gets libertarian-wise.BTW I'm an independent and voted for Gary Johnson, even I am 110% opposed to privatizing prisons. But you gotta go with the biggest issues, and the bigger picture.That said, Rand gets my vote in the primaries. If the establishment shuts him down, I'm voting Gary Johnson 2016, baby ; )</comment>

<comment>I think it's very hard to tell if Rand Paul is doing well or not.  Polling is done using landlines and self-provided cell phone numbers, which means more traditional and more politically active people are going to be polled.The least likely people to be polled are the least traditional - no landline, only watch streaming video, get their news from self-curated sources, etc...I'm really curious what will happen when votes start getting counted.</comment>

<comment>I may be the biggest Rand Paul supporter on this comment section right now, but to be honest we said the exact same thing about Ron Paul in 2008, and again in 2012, and that didn't really work out so well.  Instead, I just figure people as a rule are largely emotional, infantile, and dumb. :-(</comment>

<comment>I was a big Ron Paul supporter and at times I have thought of backing Rand. He was strong in this debate, and I also liked the stand he took against both the Patriot and the Freedom Acts. However, he is NOT his father on issues of separation of state and religion. He panders far too much to social conservatives. And he does not go far enough on supporting other rights. His position on cannabis, for example, is much better than any  other Republican candidate, but Bernie is the better rights advocate on this and many other issues.</comment>

<comment>I think Rand is probably a lot closer to Ron than a many of his more libertarian leaning supporters realize.  He says all the same things Ron did, but just in a different language.  Just like you can say the exact same thing in Greek vs English, and yet sound completely different, Ron spoke liberty and Rand speaks neocon; different languages but they are ultimately saying the same things.  I get that the neocon language is jarring and unpleasant to the ears of a libertarian, but the reality is that Rand is a LOT closer to Ron than some folks give him credit for, he's just speaking a different language that more mainstream republicans understand.</comment>

<comment>I grasp your metaphor but I disagree. It's not just semantics. He really was trying to be all things to Republicans for a while. I see that he is returning more to his roots, now that his strategy has backfired so badly. I would be much more excited for a candidate who was willing to lose by sticking with principle than try to win by pandering and holding his finger to the breeze. Like his father did. And like Bernie is doing now. Even though Bernie proposes far more government solutions than I prefer, I still find him the stronger bet.</comment>

<comment>Ilike the guy.</comment>

<comment>Does this mean the Paul acolytes and the Trump acolytes are going to show up and try to out ridiculous each other? Maybe Jiffy Pop will show up, so I can eat him whilst observing the show.</comment>

<comment>Paul supporters don't go that route. There's always knuckleheads regardless of candidate, but for the most part Paul supporters are pretty much articulate and respectful.</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying they're identical. I'm saying they tend to provide forms of entertainment.</comment>

<comment>Oh, okay : )</comment>

<comment>Conor, correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't Rand supported increases in military spending at every turn?He talks a good game pertaining to avoiding unnecessary entanglements and I applaud him for that. I think that if he truly wanted to place reigns on the military industrial complex then he'd cut their allowance. Typically, you don't buy toys unless you intend on playing with them.</comment>

<comment>You are definitely wrong.  Rand Paul has consistently advocated a 1% cut on every line item in the budget, including DOD spending, since the day he started running for US Senate, and has the math proving that this plan balances the budget in 5 years.  I just heard him reiterate that plan at a live forum yesterday.</comment>

<comment>He calls it the "one cent solution," or the "penny plan," and for 4 solid years he wore a red penny in place of a lapel pin to promote the plan.</comment>

<comment>That's better than I would have thought. Do you think a 1% cut in the military budget is appropriate or would you like to see a bigger cut?</comment>

<comment>I am a former US Marine, and I thoroughly believe that the DOD could take a bigger cut than 1% without damaging our effectiveness, and indeed if it were done right we could actually INCREASE effectiveness and readiness while cutting as much as 30%.However, the general public is not articulate enough on these issues to understand that yet, so I would not advocate for more than 1% until we can teach the voters how to cut more while still _increasing readiness and effectiveness.As of now, the general public thinks any cut to the DOD budget will simply gut the military.  Obviously this is not true, but so long as they believe that then advocating for more than a 1% cut will be woefully counterproductive.</comment>

<comment>No he has not.  He but forward an increased military spending bill, ONE bill, that also cut the budget from other programs to pay for it.  He knew it would never pass, it was only there to expose the hypocrisy of the "conservatives".</comment>

<comment>The most interesting thing about that amendment, is that both Rubio and Cruz voted against it, even after both had supported Rubio's earlier amendment to increase defense spending by a LESSER amount, while continuing to BORROW more money!Only 3 other senators supported Paul's bill - McConnell, Vitter and Enzi. http://www.senate.gov/legislat...Obviously neither Cruz or Rubio want to stop borrowing money. By forcing a vote on this amendment Rand Paul perfectly illustrated that he is the only fiscal conservative running for president.</comment>

<comment>Amen</comment>

<comment>You realize that there's an actual difference in the Budget between Military funding and Defense funding , Right ??</comment>

<comment>I understand the conceptual difference but I don't think they're broken out or formally recognized as being different in the budget. For example, I'm not sure that funding for a base in Wiesbaden would be termed as military spending as opposed to defense spending.If I'm wrong, I welcome the chance to become educated on the matter.</comment>

<comment>That's not exactly true. Congress passes various types of spending bills, but they haven't passed a budget in several years. They pass ominubus spending bills, smaller spending bills, and most years they pass something referred to as the "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year ...," aka, the NDAA. Any of these types of bills can include defense spending. Not sure why you think there's a formal distinction between 'military,' and 'defense' spending.</comment>

<comment>Very strongly agree with the content of this article. I'm a lifelong *conservative* Republican, but conservative used to mean pro-free trade and a sober appreciation of the limits of state action in all areas, including foreign policy. Republicans these days are more like Latin American leftwing populists than the Burkean conservatism I adhere to. Rand is virtually the only candidate I feel any affinity for, and if Trump is nominated, I'm voting Democrat for the first time in my life.</comment>

<comment>I can't say I'd vote Democrat, but I feel much the same. After Cruz's idiotic "Obamacare for the Internet" stance on net neutrality, some of Rubio's foreign policy aggressiveness, Trump's... everything, and the other miscellany of flubs, goof-ups, miscues, and ill-informed policies across the board, it's hard to feel good about any of the field that is polling above 5%. That's an awful place to be.</comment>

<comment>If the nominations go to Trump and Hillary, large portions of America will be looking carefully at all those other candidates listed below.  We are due for a break in the D / R monopoly anyway, and that might be the silver lining in two terrible nominations.</comment>

<comment>You should only vote Democrat if Bernie Sanders is the candidate. Hilary is just like the rest of the Bill-of- Rights-shredding neocon warmongers.If Paul doesn't get the nomination you might want to check out Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party. He got the most votes ever for the party in '12 and is building off that to run again. I voted for him after Ron Paul got shut out and I don't regret it one bit. Hopefully he'll have a chance to debate this time. He's suing the bi-partisan Commission on Presidential debates, who have not let a third party candidate on the stage since Ross Perot in '92. They refused to let him debate in '96 after his excellent showing the previous election, refused Nader in 2000 (even using POLICE FORCE to keep him away from the stage), and every viable third party candidate since.This has been the biggest hindrance to the progress of our country. They don't want the people to be exposed to new ideas and reforms, but to keep the status quo by giving them stale debates between two establishment candidates.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  The problems in Washington start with the oligopoly of our two party system, suppressing new ideas, limiting the power of our vote to choose only between deeply entrenched candidates who are dedicated to protecting the interests of their respective party and its underwriters.  It's time to break those unions.</comment>

<comment>Damn. Couldn't have said it any better...</comment>

<comment>Great article by the Atlantic , love your magazine. Rand Paul is the only candidate to stop the drug war, mentions that the West funds Al Quaeda / ISIS, and wants to take a look at the "Federal" Reserve. You have Trump who is basically a fascist, Rubio and Jeb neocons.. I mean you have to be practically retarded to vote for another Bush or Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul opposes legalization of marijuana, and he certainly doesn't support legalizing all the other recreational drugs.</comment>

<comment>Well he supports getting the feral federal government out of Marijuana laws and leaving it up to the states. More than Obama the failure in Chief has done.</comment>

<comment>The 'war on drugs' involves a lot more than marijuana, Bud.</comment>

<comment>Heh. Bud.</comment>

<comment>Sure but right now the population can back this step.  No reason not to push for it while awaiting the next steps.If you push too much too quickly the tide turns against you and future progress is halted if not previous progress reversed.People in groups adapt to change slowly.</comment>

<comment>Obviously, but all you've done is try to disparage other people's positions, how about you state your own?  What are your views on the Federal reserve, American drug policy, and ISIS? And try to back it up with facts.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I can't stand when people just don't resist throwing in a smart ass dig when making their comments. As if that's gonna make people be more receptive to their views. Child's play, man...</comment>

<comment>"More than Obama the failure in Chief has done."Nope. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law and under the supremacy clause, that law is binding on the states.State wide marijuana only exists because Obama has allowed the states to have it. So Obama has done more than Paul.So in this case, you're the failure, but only in the sense that your argument was wrong.</comment>

<comment>Wrong.  He believes it is none of the federal governments business.  Article 10 Section 8, leaves this power to the states.  There is no constitutionality for federal drug laws.  In reality there is no constitutionality for any drug laws anywhere in the U.S.  It speaks to your right to liberty, if you want to be a giant unhealthy fat ass in this country, that is your right, just like it is your right to be a drug using loser.</comment>

<comment>The US Supreme Court disagrees with you.</comment>

<comment>The US Supreme Court also said federal Obamacare penalties were legal, and segregation was Constitutional.</comment>

<comment>That's completely irrelevant to this discussion, and only shows you don't understand our constitutional system.</comment>

<comment>LMAO!  smdh</comment>

<comment>There is no power of Judicial Review to be found anywhere in Article 3 of the US Constitution.</comment>

<comment>You appear to just be making this stuff up as you go.https://reason.com/blog/2015/0...https://www.youtube.com/watch?...http://www.gloucestertimes.com...http://www.theweedblog.com/ran...http://www.ontheissues.org/Dom...</comment>

<comment>None of your links refute my claims.</comment>

<comment>LOL! smdh</comment>

<comment>No - he has definitely supported the right of the states to set their own policies, and s recommended decriminalizing or reducing penalties for possession of small quantities.</comment>

<comment>Well he's the only candidate for legalization of medial marijuana. And the drug war is just not about drug use. It's about the racial disparity of of those policies, and the unfair practices of mandatory minimums. He is been VERY vocal about all of that.</comment>

<comment>"Rand Paul is the only candidate to stop the drug war"Wait. There's no drug war?</comment>

<comment>You're an idiot.</comment>

<comment>You know there's an edit feature, right? I'm just funnin' ya buddy.</comment>

<comment>CNN interview with Rand Paul regarding Syriahttp://www.cnn.com/2015/11/03/..."He said as president, he'd only go to war with approval from Congress -- but if the United States was entering combat, it'd be in large numbers.""I would never put underwhelming force if we went to war, and if there was a declaration of war, I would put overwhelming force -- I wouldn't mess around," Paul said.He has clearly stated an open ended commitment using US forces in another middle east war. Since the declared enemy would be ISIS, that would entail using overwhelming forces in three or four countries, presumably with or without these nations agreement.</comment>

<comment>If the Congress declares war, you go to war.  That's what obeying the Constitution means.  Every time we have gone to war with proper Congressional authority like a Declaration or Marque, it has been a success and it has made the world a better place.  Every time we have engaged militarily WITHOUT proper Congressional Marque or a Declaration, it has been a disaster.</comment>

<comment>Not my point. RP is not articulating a position on ISIS that is less hawkish or less misguided than Cruz, and in fact he is more hawkish than Rubio or Obama or Clinton.CF is whitewashing RP's actual position.</comment>

<comment>No, they're not.  Your perception seems to be in error here.  Any time you say military action must be precipitated by a proper Congressional Declaration of War, that is less hawkish than unilateral action.  Even leaving aside that critical point, Rand is not talking "Regime Change" in Syria and he never has -- he has opposed that nonsense from day 1, while Rubio, Obama, and Clinton ARE talking regime change in Syria.</comment>

<comment>Just stop trying to deny the obvious on what RP's actual policy position  on the use of force against ISIS is.. He has said that he would ask Congress to declare war and if that is decided he would use overwhelming force to destroy ISIS everywhere.That means an invasion using a large ground force and all necessary support.Russia is aiding Assad and Assad would not approve that and so that would entail a war with Russia in the middle east. Rand Paul is not against such a war, he has said as president he would ask for a declaration of war.</comment>

<comment>Umm, I'm certainly not the one denying the obvious, and if you seriously believe that "declaring war against ISIS alone" is more militaristic than "Take out ISIS, take out Assad, and while we are at it, punch Russia in the face too," then I don't know what to tell you.</comment>

<comment>Do you realize that Syria and Rusia have said that they do not accept the use of force by outside forces in Syria?The use of force against ISIS  in Syria without its permission is an act of war against Syria because Syria is a sovereign country.That is why the US seeks approval from the government if Iraq to continue to operate there.</comment>

<comment>ISIS is in a lot more places than Syria.</comment>

<comment>Which means that the RP policy would entail a very very large US ground force operating throughout the middle east and N. Africa.Russia has forces in Syria, and Iran has proxy forces there too.</comment>

<comment>You are pretty much seeing what you want to see.  If Assad and Russia are adamant about nobody but them entering Syria, then a war on ISIS could very well involve cooperating with Russia by taking them out everywhere but Syria, and leaving ISIS in Syria to Russia.  Rand has repeatedly made clear that he has no desire to confront Russia militarily.  This should be clear and easy to understand.</comment>

<comment>Have you been following the Russia Turkey dispute and Russia's warning to Turkey?Declaring War and using force necessary is not compatible with negotiating how much and what kinds and where that force is used. That is not me seeing things. It is simply what everyone understands to be the case.RP has equivocated and said incompatible things on this issue and only the willfully blind don't see that.</comment>

<comment>Are you confusing Paul Ryan with Rand Paul?  Because that would explain a lot.</comment>

<comment>You read the quote above on declaring war on ISIS.  You understand that he advocates all necessary force.  You get the idea that ISIS operates in several sovereign countries and that using US forces --all necessary overwhelming force-- is an open ended very large commitment and yet you pretend that is not a disastrous repetition of Afghanistan and Iraq? RP has gradually abandoned a non-intervention policy on the middle east and adopted the all in commitment to a regional war.</comment>

<comment>He is obviously advocating a less hawkish position.  For example Rubio is willing to do this now - declaration or no declaration as if the President is an emperor.</comment>

<comment>The issue is how much and what kind of force is to be used. RP has stated that he wants a declaration of war and would ask for one if elected. He has stated that he would use any force necessary to destroy ISIS, including the use of whatever numbers of ground troops that takes.Apparently he hasn't noticed that Russia has moved its forces to Syria and that Assad would not agree to US ground troops. So he is advocating a war that would include US and Russian ground, sea and air forces on opposite sides. That sounds about as hawkish and misguided as it gets.</comment>

<comment>I've never seen him argue for a declaration of war against ISIS or Syria.  He has said that if others want to go to war they should get one.  He has said that if a declaration of war is passed (for anything) he would engage fully because his job in that regard is to command the military not decide if we go to war or not - which is the role of Congress.</comment>

<comment>"If I were president, I would call a joint session of Congress. I would  lay out the reasoning of why ISIS is a threat to our national security and seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily."http://theweek.com/speedreads/...</comment>

<comment>Thanks for that.  Reading the full transcript it seems I can't tell if he is stating what he would do if elected or if he were in the position Obama was in a year ago and had the same view as Obama.</comment>

<comment>The quote from the AP is clear."I would...seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily"</comment>

<comment>He has asked for a Declaration against ISIS alone.  I personally think Marque and Reprisal is a better tool for that job, but at least he's 100% obeying the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>'Letters of Marque and Reprisal' is just a fancy way of saying, 'outsourcing war to private contractors (aka mercenaries).'</comment>

<comment>No, it's not.  The US Marines fought and defeated the Barbary Pirates under Marque and Reprisal.  The US Marines may be many things, but we are not mercenaries.</comment>

<comment>Marque and reprisal relates solely to privateers, and effectively converts private vessels into Navy auxiliaries. The US Marines don't need letters of marque and reprisal, although privateers did contract with the federal govt to carry Marines.</comment>

<comment>Thomas Jefferson sent the US Marines in to sack Tripoli under Marque and Reprisal.  And we did.  You are missing the "Reprisal" part of Marque and Reprisal, and focusing solely on the "Marque."</comment>

<comment>So what'd they bring back? I'll admit my Jeffersonian era history's a bit foggy.</comment>

<comment>They brought back American hostages that were taken by the Barbary Pirates and being held for ransom.  They basically sacked Tripoli and said "Give our people back or we will level your city."  After a bit of angst, wailing, and a couple demonstrations of the capabilities of US Marines, they gave the hostages back and we went home.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough. So, then, what would we be bringing back this time? (I don't think he's missing the "reprisal" bit, incidentally.)</comment>

<comment>Marque and Reprisal does not require bringing anything back.  It is a scalpel to a Declaration of War's sledgehammer.</comment>

<comment>Well, no. Strictly speaking, particularly in the historical context re: the Barbary conflict, a letter of marque endows a private actor with the means/justification to enter the waters of a foreign power for the purposes of taking a ship (or goods,) and the letter of reprisal is what gives the aforementioned ship the legal justification to return the ship/goods to a friendly port.Of course, the US has generally abided by things like the Paris Agreement respecting Maritime Law (despite not being a signatory) and the Declaration on Principles of International Law, both of which at least frown on marque/reprisal.I'll admit my maritime law's a bit rusty. I had to call in a couple favors.</comment>

<comment>Marque does not require the taking of anything, rather some kind of action, whether that action is deprivation of goods or persons, or the application of force.  Reprisal authorizes the application of commando style US military force against a person, party, state, or non state entity that has done us harm.</comment>

<comment>Not in maritime tradition."whether that action is deprivation of goods or persons, or the application of force."I'm curious as to how the first two aren't taking something. The third bit's sort of necessary, but is internationally frowned upon when it's done for its own sake (again, from the previous two mentioned documents that we generally abide by.) We've issued at best a handful (and I think it's actually one) of letters of M/R since 1815, mostly because they piss civilized countries off.The reprisal refers to bringing things back in order to seek some sort of recompense. Were I you, I'd start with Francis Upton's Maritime Warfare and Prize or Donald Petrie's The Prize Game.I'm fully willing to admit that my understanding may be incomplete, of course.</comment>

<comment>Not requiring something to be taken, does not mean that things cannot be taken.  That is a "Black and White" fallacy.Obviously Marque and Reprisal refers to more than only ships at sea, or it would not have been issued to the US Marines who landed in Egypt and marched overland to Tripoli.</comment>

<comment>"Not requiring something to be taken, does not mean that things cannot be taken. That is a "Black and White" fallacy."Fair enough. This will become circular pretty clearly, so we'll call it an impasse."Obviously Marque and Reprisal refers to more than only ships at sea, or it would not have been issued to the US Marines who landed in Egypt and marched overland to Tripoli."On the other hand, this is fraught with two fairly shaky assumptions. First, you're at least giving the appearance of asserting that the fact that something comes from a maritime tradition means that letters of marque would definitionally prevent people from stepping off of ships (they apply to the ships/organizations granted them.) You're also assuming that these letters of marque were issued in good faith (as opposed to being an end run around having to declare war.)And that doesn't begin to address the more problematic aspects of modern day letters of marque (both in that they don't exist and why they don't exist.) Just because something's sketchily outlined in the Constitution doesn't make it a thing we should do.Have a lovely day.</comment>

<comment>You are sorely mistaken. Letter of marque and reprisal are issued by governments to privateers, not to the Armed Forces.</comment>

<comment>So "From the Halls of Montezuma, to the Shores of Tripoli" is just a figment of our collective imaginations?</comment>

<comment>It's a line in a song. Notice there's no mention of Marque and Reprisal in the Marines' Hymn? That's because the Marines and other Armed Forces operate under the flag of our nation, and under the authority of the Commander-In-Chief; the Marines don't need a letter of Marque and Reprisal in order to conduct operations. Only privateers need a special permission slip granting them the right to act as agents of the state.</comment>

<comment>It's historical fact that the US Marines sacked Tripoli under Marque and Reprisal.</comment>

<comment>Letters of Marque and Reprisal are commissioned to the authorized vessel, not to the individual soldiers and crew members it carried. In other words, the letters weren't issued to captains of ships, but to the ship as a whole, and were not transferable to other vessels.</comment>

<comment>If Marque and Reprisal only applies to ships at sea, then how and why did the US Marines operate on Marque and Reprisal when they marched overland from Egypt to Tripoli in 1801, with no ships in sight?</comment>

<comment>"If Marque and Reprisal only applies to ships at sea, then how and why did the US Marines operate on Marque and Reprisal when they marched overland from Egypt to Tripoli in 1801, with no ships in sight?"The answer to your question is, well...that's not what happened. The Battle of Derne (which is what you almost have to be referring to) happened in 1805. The march was led by a man named William Eaton, a former military officer and envoy in the region who was commissioned as a navy lieutenant prior to returning to the area in 1804. The 500 or so Arab and Greek mercenaries that the United States hired for the land expidition? Letters of Marque. Sure. I'll buy that you can call them that, although it's just as reasonable to call them simply hired mercenaries. There's your mild victory. The eight Marines, as they were employed by the US at the time, were placed on detached service under Eaton's command. This marching force did, in fact, receive naval support, in the form of the Nautilus, the Hornet, and the Argus.The good news for you is that you get a bit of a victory here. While letters of marque and reprisal are rooted in maritime tradition, after a bit more digging, I will concede that hiring mercenaries could be considered letters of marque, and that those contracts can be granted for operations involving land combat.</comment>

<comment>But the Marines were there, they were armed, and they fought.  M&R is more than just bounties alone.  Sure bounties are heavily involved on the Marque side, but US Armed Forces are heavily involved on the Reprisal side too.If we go into Iraq with a Billion dollars and two battalions of Marine Raiders, we can issue bounties against the middle-high level ISIS operators and enforcers, and then while hundreds or even thousands of locals are running amok trying to win those bounties the Marine Raiders can operate with impunity behind that smokescreen and take out ISIS leadership.</comment>

<comment>"But the Marines were there, they were armed, and they fought. "So that's your evidence? It...doesn't work like that. The marines were there under the command of a commissioned naval officer. They were not subcontracted in any way. The fact that they were fighting in the same unit as a part of a combined force does not mean that the manner in which they came to be in the same fighting force was identical. Is this the extent of your evidence that they were issued letters of marque and reprisal? Because it's about as airtight as your "known historical fact.""M&R is more than just bounties alone. Sure bounties are heavily involved on the Marque side, but US Armed Forces are heavily involved on the Reprisal side too."Oh, for Christ's sake. I don't know how to make this any clearer. I'm not talking about about bounties. I'm talking about contracts. We paid mercenaries to fight. That's the only thing in this war that could plausibly be called a letter of marque. What you're talking about is the hiring of mercenaries. Under your definition, we were using letters of marque and reprisal in Iraq in the middle of the last decade. Is that what you're trying to say? Because, well, you'd be wrong, but you'd at least be consistent.</comment>

<comment>No, we should have used Marque and Reprisal in Afghanistan and we did not.  We should not have gone into Iraq at all.  Neither were Constitutionally legitimate actions.</comment>

<comment>And you are clearly talking about letters of MARQUE, which involve bounties and privateers.  REPRISAL on the other hand authorizes direct action by bands of US warriors in a commando role.</comment>

<comment>If there is a Congressional Declaration of War (which has not happened since 1941) that means that Congress has openly debated the merits of war, named the countries against which it is warring, and come to a consensus.  In that case, the Commander and Chief MUST follow the rule of law and lead the military to war and victory to the best of our ability.  This discussion is theoretical, and most people don't even know the difference between declared war and these pathetic military conflicts we have engaged in ever since Korea.</comment>

<comment>RP said he would seek a declaration of war on ISIS and then use any means necessary to destroy it. The issue is whether that is a dangerous policy that commits the US to an open ended war in the middle east.</comment>

<comment>I interpreted it to mean that IF he were to go to war against ISIS, he would get a Congressional declaration, not that he particularly desires to.  But EITHER WAY, the decision would be made by 535 people, not one person's executive orders, which is tempering in and of itself.</comment>

<comment>The point that separates sane and reasonable people from others is whether a general war by the US in the middle east using all means necessary is a good idea. Rand Paul said he would "seek" a declaration of war, that he would make a case if elected that it is the US interest to do that. If you think it is a good idea then you support the policy he advocates.  If you think it would engage the US in an open ended war in the middle east and likely find the US and Russia fighting each other there then you should a question whether Rand Paul is fit to be president."If I were president, I would call a joint session of Congress. I would lay out the reasoning of why ISIS is a threat to our national security and seek congressional authorization to destroy ISIS militarily."</comment>

<comment>I'm a left leaning independent closely following the Republican primaries because the candidates are so unbelievable. But when I listened to Rand Paul in the debate he sounded more presidential than all the boys to his right. I disagree with him on many issues, but his stands on corporate welfare and global warfare make him the only Republican candidate I'd consider over Hilary. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>what? why insult me?</comment>

<comment>It's a trollbot. Ignore.</comment>

<comment>He's just trying to be funny and failing miserably.  Pay no mind, nobody is taking him seriously.</comment>

<comment>I view Rand as the only trustworthy adult in the race in the two major parties.  He understands the limits on the office of President and that bloviating or changing positions in the political wind is not why we elect someone to preside over the process of government.</comment>

<comment>So, if he loses the primary are you sitting the general election out?</comment>

<comment>I may vote for a 3rd party candidate if one is up to snuff but most likely I won't cast a ballot for President / Vice if he doesn't get the nomination.</comment>

<comment>The word you're looking for is "when."</comment>

<comment>Most likely.</comment>

<comment>I think if it is a Trump/Hillary race, a lot of people will be sitting this one out.  Both candidates are so offensive to such a large portion of Americans in both parties (basically everyone who doesn't want a ruthless pathological lying narcissist as President) that this will be the best chance for a viable 3rd party candidate to step in and get votes in decades.  Where is Ross Perot when you need him?</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul is the only one who seems to make any realistic sense. But the Republican Party will never let him be their candidate, especially after what they did to his father.</comment>

<comment>Paul's an idiot.  "do you believe in the Constitution?" What?? Hm I'm not sure let me think about that.  "getting rid of the First amendment, OK? It's no small feat."  Oh well then forget about it too much trouble there.</comment>

<comment>So what you are saying is abolishing the First Amendment is a lot of work, but you believe it's worth it?</comment>

<comment>We do these things not because they are easy but because they aah haaahd.</comment>

<comment>LMAO! smdh</comment>

<comment>Stand with Rand!Of the current crop of Republican candidates, he's streets ahead. See him here, a true statesman who actually discusses the Constitution, and protecting your Constitutional liberties. The Constitution: a short crucial document I doubt most candidates have read.His foreign policy is spot on.</comment>

<comment>First we are told that our support of Arab dictators is one of the reasons "why they hate us." Now we are told the Muslim Arab world needs dictators because they just start murdering each other without one. My takeaway? There's a good reason for us not to grab that particular tar baby.</comment>

<comment>From the pov of a longtime ally of America, this GOP field dumbs down dumb. It's frightening how stupid high ranking American officials are , right now. They accused Obama of being feckless, and in the same breath, bragged about the Saudi-led Sunni coalition. They accused Iran of sponsoring terror, and ignored who in the World is sponsoring Sunni terror , far more menacing. Some ignore elementary school stuff, like the Triad. Your Allies can't handle having to teach the entire World History, Geography, Geopolitics, Political Economy, all over again. like we had to do with Dubya. Hell, i'll even take Kissinger back. Spare us the stupidiest of "the stupid party.".</comment>

<comment>There is no question but that we should be holding Saudi Arabia in far more contempt than the establishment elites do.  This is one of the reasons I support Rand Paul, he is not in favor of maintaining continued alliances with Saudi Arabia, and has proposed (among other things) in his moratorium banning all travel visas to Saudis.  Speculation is that his push to declassify the 28 pages from the 9/11 Report will reveal a lead role in the attack taken by Saudi Arabia.</comment>

<comment>It's not just Terrorism. It's Wahabism, the base from which "radical Islam" is coming from. Saudi Arabia's prints are all over it. And it wouldn't had got this bad, if Saudis weren't officillaly "US Allies". Reagan was fine with Saudis setting up madrassas in Tribal Pakistan, to breed "holy warriors" to fight the Soviets. We're still paying for those mistakes. I'm a realist, first the US needs to clean up in house, then face up to the "outer threat". Putin's beligerance has always been inside his little box. He's not going anywhere. Deal with the inner threat first. Right now, the Shias are tree-huggers, compared with the Gulf Monarquies. I've had enough with oil-spoiled Sunni "Princes" playing Risk.</comment>

<comment>If this campaign has not convinced Conor and other so-called libertarians that the Republican party is no place for a person who favors civil liberties and is skeptical of war, I don't know what will. Rand Paul is the proof of concept. He is polling at around 2%. And after that debate he is more likely to go down than up.Pay attention Conor.   The Republican party is ruled by its reptilian instinct.</comment>

<comment>Just more proof that the VAST majority of Republicans are not real conservatives.Calling Neocon supporters and liberal Trump supporters "conservative" is like calling David Koresh "the second coming of Jesus Christ".</comment>

<comment>They are radical reactionaries not interested in conserving anything other than their own power over what used to be weaker parties. And that train left the station.</comment>

<comment>"White man's party" is in its death throws. </comment>

<comment>“Large swaths of the GOP primary electorate” can’t support Rand Paul because to do so, would be to admit that they were totally wrong about foreign policy and the Iraq war, while everything Congressman Ron Paul had ever warned about our foreign policy, the Iraq war, and the “Patriot act” was absolutely correct! The Amazingly Accurate Predictions of Ron Paul on the Economy & War https://www.youtube.com/watch?...In 2008 and 2012, incredible amounts of energy were expended by the GOP and the media to smear and marginalize Ron Paul. It is just astonishing when you go back and rewatch just how badly the anti-Pauls behaved!Fox News 2007 https://www.youtube.com/watch?...John Stewart media bias towards Ron Paul https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Huntsman posts ‘“racist” ad, blames Ron Paul, right before NH primary https://www.youtube.com/watch?...There are hundreds more like this...</comment>

<comment>I like Paul but he's got to catch fire soon or the only conclusion you can arrive at is he's in the wrong party and should be running as a libertarian.</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul and Ron Paul's policies have been the Republican Party Platform pretty much from 1854 through 1980, and arguably through 1988.</comment>

<comment>some of their policies, like not getting involved in the world's conflicts unless really necessary were American policy and ideal until the 1960s.</comment>

<comment>Rand Paul, like his dad, is skeptical of the merit of perpetual foreign aid. Ron Paul's saying "Foreign aid is taking money from the poor in rich countries and giving it to the rich in poor countries". Rand once posited ending or severely curtailing foreign aid across the board, including Israel. Later he changed that to not include Israel, but the damage was done. He is no longer trusted by the establishment, which is heavily influenced by Zionists. Maybe he could get back in their good graces by proposing war with Iran.</comment>

<comment>And remember how the media reports it?Ron (or Rand Paul) say it's wrong that taxpayers are forced to pay for foreign aid, and the media misleads the public with headlines stating "Ron Paul wants to end foreign aid to Israel!" as if that was his primary intention.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he is like his dad... The Soviet apologist.  If Ron Paul was president instead of Ronald Reagan, the world would still be dealing with the Evil Empire.</comment>

<comment>Ron Paul (like Hayek and von Mises) said the Soviets had a system that wouldn't work and would eventually fall of its own weight. Which is what happened - not much to do with Reagan, other than setting an example. Now the neocons have another "Evil Empire" in Putin's Russia and want to start shooting at his planes in their arrogance and recklessness.</comment>

<comment>While saying that, opposed countering the Soviet's... History has shown how wrong and immoral that stance was.</comment>

<comment>Well.  There it is.  The stupidest thing I've read all day.You do know that Reagan defeated the Soviet Union with DIPLOMACY, right?  Both Ron and Rand have stated repeatedly that the most important weapon in our arsenal should be DIPLOMACY, right?Of all the Republican candidates to run for office since 1988, Ron Paul and Rand Paul are the most Reagan-like of the lot.</comment>

<comment>How do you have effective diplomacy?Leverage.How did Reagan create leverage?Countering the Soviet's and showing them they were 100% outclassed and will never win the Cold War.Ron Paul, like the rest of the Soviet apologists then, were clearly on the wrong side of history...not all that much different than Rand.</comment>

<comment>Sure, why not?  Bombing random countries is not leverage it is recklessness.  Shooting down Russian jets is not leverage it is recklessness.  Taking such action is abandoning leverage and laying all the cards on the table.  The only candidate in either party maintaining any leverage, is Rand Paul.</comment>

<comment>...and yet, the Evil Empire was defeated and tens of millions of people now live in freedom in eastern Europe and Europe and the world is a 1000% stable and secure because of it.You defending the USSR and Ron Paul opposing countering them is not an argument you are going to win outside of certain circles in Russia.  </comment>

<comment>The only person claiming that the USSR would not have collapsed under Rand or Ron Paul, is you.  Literally nobody is defending the Soviet Union.  You appear to have a very active imagination.</comment>

<comment>Well please find me Republicans that disagree with Ronald Reagan's moral and strong approach to countering the Soviet's and if you can, those are the few people that agree with you and your favorite Soviet apologists, the Paul family.</comment>

<comment>What are you talking about?  Is English not your primary language?</comment>

<comment>Yup.Move to Russia, comrade.</comment>

<comment>The only person enabling Russian aggression here, is you.  Go ahead, shoot down a Russian jet.  Gulf of Tonkin in reverse.  WW3 on the horizon YAAAY!</comment>

<comment>A Libertarian candidate has no chance in the GOP.Libertarian candidates would be more successful in the Democratic Party.Libertarians are against foreign affairs intervention, but that goes against the many neo-con Republicans who absolutely love meddling in foreign affairs and regime changes.Libertarians are against big government, but that goes against the many Republicans who absolutely love Big Government spending (as long as the spending is on Defense).Libertarians are for freedom in social matters (drug use, prostitution, gay marriage etc.), but that goes against the many Republicans who absolutely love Jesus.So what chance can Rand Paul have? Zero!!!</comment>

<comment>Neocons are big-government progressive liberal interlopers.  They got their boost in American politics by forcing Reagan to take George HW Bush as VP against his will.  The policies you describe are historically called "conservative."Barry Goldwater, a conservative icon, opposed the war on drugs and the influence of the POLITICAL "Christian Right,"  William F. Buckley, a conservative icon, also opposed the war on drugs and social interventionism.As a devout Christian who loves Jesus myself, I question the credibility of any person who claims to be a Christian but wants to throw people in jail having harmed no one but themselves.</comment>

<comment>I hate to burst your bubble but that type of "Conservatism" (or "Libertarianism", or "Liberalism, as it's known in Europe) does not exist anymore in the GOP. That is a fringe minority.The GOP is controlled by "Interventionists" both in foreign affairs (the Neo-Cons) and in social affairs (the Christian Right).If I had to put money on the winner of the GOP primaries it would be on either Rubio or Cruz, who respectively represent the two "interventionist" factions above.I can tell you that any other GOP candidate, especially R. Paul, would lose to Hillary Clinton, because she is basically a Republican Neo-Con disguised as a Democrat, and against someone like R. Paul she would get the full support of the Republican Neo-Cons, in addition to her own Dems.</comment>

<comment>Except in pretty much every head to head General Election poll ever taken, Rand Paul performs best against Hillary than the entire rest of the field.</comment>

<comment>Liberalism doesn't exist in the Democratic party either, despite all of the blustering about "dem liberals" right wing commentators love to make.   I consider myself a classical liberal, and I assure you that I have few friends anywhere in American politics.</comment>

<comment>I can respect that Paul has his principles and stands by them no matter what, but I don't agree with most of his principles and, as my father used to tell me, "you can't eat principles."A real leader knows when to depart from ideology and principle and act with realism.  That's not Paul.He's going to be a footnote in American political history like his father, nothing more.</comment>

<comment>Abandoning principle is not the sign of a good leader, it is a signet of why America is dying.  Also, your comprehension of what policies he holds is woefully lacking in truth and veracity.</comment>

<comment>I didn't say abandoning, I said when to act realistically instead of by ideology and principles, which leaders must do because the real world isn't black and white but full of gray.  You can keep your ideolog and maybe he can become a professor or TV host where being an ideolog actually has a place where they can't do harm and can play academic exercises.</comment>

<comment>Why do you think principles are unrealistic?</comment>

<comment>Because the black and white world of an ideolog has little to do with the gray real world.</comment>

<comment>Okay, let's take one principle.  "If we must use military force, then we need to declare war, go in and fight with everything we've got, win it, and come home."  How exactly is that principle inferior to these limited commitments and nation building exercises that have armed ISIS?</comment>

<comment>Because sometimes the Executive Branch has to act and not waste time declaring a war in Congress.If Bill Clinton did that, how far would have the Serbian genocide gone before it was stopped?Rand and Ron would have sat on their hands as genocide wiped out Kosovars with that meek and feckless thinking.</comment>

<comment>If Congress did not want to go into Bosnia, then we should not have gone into Bosnia.  If, on the other hand, Congress had chosen to authorize the Serbian campaign, then we would not have had our hands tied and we could have ended it faster, and with less collateral damage.  You don't get to just abandon the Constitution whenever it becomes inconvenient.  That's not the sign of a 'leader,' it is the sign of a criminal and a traitor.</comment>

<comment>They didn't want to and if the Executive did not use the war powers of the Executive Branch, you would have seen that genocide consume tens of thousands of more lives.If you call that leadership by letting genocide happen, I feel sorry for you.</comment>

<comment>Fine then, feel sorry for me.  I believe that the US Constitution actually means something.  I, on the other hand, look at your willingness to abandon the Constitution whenever it becomes inconvenient, and I see the reason why America is dying.</comment>

<comment>Your understanding of the system is puddle deep.The issue has already been resolved legally.  Congress can put into law things that delegate some of their powers to other agencies.  The War Powers act and the yearly NDAA Congress passes every year gives the President some leeway in the need to declare war for every use of the armed forces.</comment>

<comment>Just because Congress passes a law, does not make it Constitutional.  Just because SCOTUS approves of a law, does not make it Constitutional.</comment>

<comment>You're right, nothing is constitutional until Lord Paul deems it so.</comment>

<comment>Just open up the Constitution and read it for heaven's sake.</comment>

<comment>then what determines if its constitutional?you?</comment>

<comment>You gently led him off his own cliff. Well done.</comment>

<comment>LMAO good luck with that</comment>

<comment>Per the checks and balances and the separation of powers doctrine, the several State Legislatures (ie the parties to the Constitution) are supposed to determine that is and isn't Constitutional.  Judicial Review is not a power that has been delegated in article 3.</comment>

<comment>Where does it say States decides what is constitutional?</comment>

<comment>The States are the parties to the Constitution.  In any contract or compact, in the absence of an overt interpretation mechanism such as a mediation clause, the parties to that contract are responsible for interpreting it.  That's basic common law since before the Magna Carta.</comment>

<comment>What section or amendment</comment>

<comment>What section or amendment to the US Constitution is the Magna Carta in?  I don't think you understand how this works...</comment>

<comment>If that's a power enumerated int the constitution please tell me when it is.</comment>

<comment>Common Law is not enumerated in the Constitution, and yet it is the basis for the entire system of American jurisprudence.  Again, I don't think you understand how this works.</comment>

<comment>Sure I do.  The mechanism for states controlling the Constitution is directly written out.  It's called the amendment process.other than that they don't get any other say</comment>

<comment>The Constitution doesn't say people are allowed to eat potatoes either, and yet, Shepherd's Pie.  MMMmmmm</comment>

<comment>Principles are great. Sticking to them past the poiint of reality intruding is counter productive. The trees that last a long time tend to bend with the wind so that they don't break.</comment>

<comment>Well said and better than how I put it.</comment>

<comment>How exactly is Rand or Ron sticking to principles "past the point of reality?"  I think that's just something people say in order to justify their not wanting to elect someone who will actually obey the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Gold Standard?</comment>

<comment>Because debasing our currency until it loses 98% of it's value and further impoverishes the poor, in order to live beyond our means as a government, is so much more realistic than than building actual value through a manufacturing base and a sound currency?</comment>

<comment>sound currency?  You mean deflationary currency where the economy is artificially limited by the amount of a shiny metal someone thinks is worth stuff for some reason</comment>

<comment>No, the US Dollar has in fact lost 98% of it's value since the Federal Reserve Act.    Deflation is not the only alternative to 5000% inflation.  That's just dumb.</comment>

<comment>What was the price of an once of gold in 2008? What is the price now in constant dollars?</comment>

<comment>Fiat currencies rise and fall and rise and fall all the time.  They are inherently unstable.  That's their problem.  The price of gold collapsing in dollars is just as problematic as the price of gold skyrocketing in dollars.  If you want a better metric, check out the price of oil in gold vs the price of oil in dollars.</comment>

<comment>Here, maybe this will help:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>Rising and falling prices in response to changes in supply and demand is not a bug it is a feature of a market economy.</comment>

<comment>Prices rose and fell in response to supply and demand under the gold standard.  Under a fiat currency prices rise and fall according to the vagaries of the moods of random bankers and politicians.</comment>

<comment>There is no reason that the supply and demand for gold ought to result in a fixed price for gold any more than a fixed price for peanuts.Money has no intrinsic value. Goods have value as a consequence of supply and demand, which may be expressed in any good or more conveniently in a currency which takes its value in the same way, from supply and demand for the goods that people are willing to exchange using it.</comment>

<comment>There is an unstable quantity of peanuts on Earth.  There is a fixed unchanging and unchangeable supply of gold on Earth.</comment>

<comment>Gold is mined and recovered and used in industrial processes and ornament. The demand and supply is not fixed. Banks hold gold as reserve but also hold other assets. Banks may change the asset mix they choose to hold as reserves. For these reasons, the supply and demand for gold is not fixed. That is why the price fluctuates. There is no reason that gold should be valued in terms of other goods and services at a fixed price.</comment>

<comment>There were 220,000 tons of gold in and on the Earth 4 Billion years ago, there are 220,000 tons of gold in and on the Earth today, and there will be 220,000 tons of gold in and on the Earth a billion years from now.</comment>

<comment>Wait, you don't seriously think that the advocates of a gold standard only want it because they think gold only ever rises in price do you?  LMAO that's absurd.</comment>

<comment>No I was pointing out that there hasn't been hyperinflation judged by gold prices. There was no rapid rise in inflation since the beginning of low and negative US treasury rates..As has been mentioned, a fixed quantity of money as exemplified by France returning to the gold standard during the great depression and euro policy in the current recession results in deflation and slow recovery during financial crises.Bets against US treasuries lost a great deal of money for investors predicting hyperinflation.</comment>

<comment>It depends on when you are measuring from.  If you are measuring from a couple years ago, no inflation has not been that severe; however if you are measuring from 1913 then inflation has been debilitating.  Just like I told Neil Cavuto, I don't think we're talking Weimar Republic here.  However, the multigenerational inflationary pressure is destroying savings, making us depart from a nation of saving in strength to a nation of consumerism in weakness.All wealth is based on savings, not consumerism.  The lack of a stable currency in America has destroyed the incentive for savings, therefore making it more difficult for the poor to climb out of the gutter.</comment>

<comment>Don't make stuff up. Gold bugs said in 2008 that the Fed was going to produce hyperinflation and that hasn't happened. The dollar is not debased. Treasury rates are very low which means that the world values the dollar and regards it as a good store of value.</comment>

<comment>I'm not making anything up.  I told Neil Cavuto in 2011 that I did not expect Weimar Republic style hyperinflation.</comment>

<comment>No, they want it because they are ignorant of economics, finance and monetary policy and are scared of what they do not understand and tend to have a "bunker mentality"</comment>

<comment>Because you know what we think better than we know what we think amirite?</comment>

<comment>Yes, but that might be because I work in finance and my education is in economics.  Just like most people educated in finance and economics.</comment>

<comment>You should consider seeking a refund.  You education appears to have been in vain.  Not only do you not have a firm grasp of basic English vocabulary, you conflate entirely different economic schools of thought, and leverage logical fallacies as though they were legitimate arguments.  If that is not a sad indictment of American higher education, then I don't know what is.</comment>

<comment>in case you hadn't noticed prices have changed in that time too.</comment>

<comment>Sure, we have a fiat currency.  Prices change all over the map.  That's the point of a fiat currency.</comment>

<comment>The point of fiat currency is because ti allows us to keep deflation and inflation cycles under control.under the gold standard bank runs and mass hoarding were very common because deflation was a more real threat.</comment>

<comment>Except we've lost 98% of the value of the dollar since 1913, making the poor poorer and exacerbating the Great Depression and extenuating the Great Recession.  Good job! lol</comment>

<comment>Dollars are not limited though. We have a lot more of them than we had back in the day. They may be worth less doller per doller, but that doesn't matter if we have way more of them. What matters is how much effort we have to exert to earn enough to buy what we need and want.</comment>
