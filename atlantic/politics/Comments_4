<comment>I switched from D to R to vote for Trump. He will bring in lots of new voters.</comment>

<comment>CMJ ,anyone who has read your posting history would assume you've never been a liberal.With that said, I don't think either side can bank on what voters will do, but I think it'd be smart for the DNC to ride the wave of anti-establishment anger rather than fighting against it by nominating Clinton.</comment>

<comment>I voted for John Kerry!I've said time and again that I'm not ideologically motivated. I vote for who's best for me at any given time.</comment>

<comment>But you seem like you fight on principles rather than just your own personal needs. :( Too many Dems vote on that reason - who gives them more free stuff or makes them feel warm & fuzzy. </comment>

<comment>The only people I've met who reliably vote on principle are white liberals and white libertarians. Everyone else likes free stuff.</comment>

<comment>And it amazes me to see people just spout the 'free stuff' meme, when in fact, what Bernie's promising is that we'll get added value for the taxes we're paying rather than binge-spending our money on a plane that doesn't work or a few trillion to fight a war of choice and avenge his daddy.</comment>

<comment>Well I don't trust Bernie to begin with. And he will cost me more in taxes than I would get in benefits. My wife makes way too much money for us to be socialists.</comment>

<comment>For you to make such a statement, I must assume you haven't read his plans.  They're available on his website if you want to know how his various proposals will be funded.I'd also add that, against a Trump presidency, we'll save trillions off of unnecessary wars that Sanders won't entangle us in.</comment>

<comment>Id rather fund government with tariffs. It worked for a century.</comment>

<comment>Doesn't that mean you should just be grateful for your good fortune and want to share that with others?? What could be more meaningful than paying 12% of your combined incomes to provide single payer healthcare??</comment>

<comment>I wish Bernie Sanders well but the Elitist Establishment power is just too great in the Democrat Party.  They are beating him by 60 to 30 percent in Florida.  I hope he pulls some states out, but the DNC machine is just too well organized around Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Like all those free roads and free policing and free fire protection and free food safety inspections and free air traffic control and free military and free civil courts and....</comment>

<comment>Free prisons for people I don't like, free military to kill people I don't like, free Border Patrol to keep out people I don't like...</comment>

<comment>Yep, those are all "free" as well, and all important and legitimate functions of a state.</comment>

<comment>Those free roads are falling apart and our free policing is practically non-existent.  In case you haven't noticed, the only people who can safely go outside at night live in gated communities with private guards.  Our government has totally failed the majority of citizens of this country and the sad thing is, living in their ivory towers at the expense of taxpayers, they don't even realize the damage they've done - or maybe they just don't care.</comment>

<comment>I keep waiting for this "free stuff" that angry cons always talk about. How does one get this "free stuff"?I've voted Democratic many times, and I've never been given the secret info about how to get the "free stuff."Please tell us more.</comment>

<comment>Why do you vote democratic? And are you a minority?</comment>

<comment>Free stuff?  Are you kidding?  The middle class has been decimated in every aspect of their life.  They are simply voting for food and shelter and jobs and a decent wage.  Trump is speaking to them and they are responding.  It's really that simple.</comment>

<comment>Jobs is the key, not  flat out welfare. That's the Dems. </comment>

<comment>Call it what you want.  The hypocrisy of using the word 'welfare' - when private business who sings rhapsodies to laissez faire economics at the same time indulge in the privatizing of profits and the socializing of losses (welfare ... no?) - is stunning.  The  term 'welfare' is a red herring used in the same was as the term 'adulteress' has been and is used to shame women.</comment>

<comment>It's all abused - Corp and society. Stop being so PC about the actual name 'welfare'.</comment>

<comment>stop trolling, go to The Hill</comment>

<comment>I'll see you there.</comment>

<comment>Maybe there already?</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders would be my President there.</comment>

<comment>The DNC machine has decided to ignore anti-establishment anger and promote Clinton.  They will have misread the public and history.  The DNC is driving Democrats to the Trump campaign.The Elitist Media is also achieving the same thing.  The Washington Post Editorial Board yesterday compared Donald Trump to Josef Stalin and Pol Pot, the day before a WaPo writer compared Donald Trump to Hitler.  They are working very hard with their massive bias to help convince the American people to vote for Trump, that is what they are really achieving.</comment>

<comment>He saidd democrat. You don't have to be a liberal to be a dem. But then again that's why both parties continue to lose influence and support.</comment>

<comment>Fair point.</comment>

<comment>You've been here a while. You didn't switch for Trump. No one has so far as I can tell. </comment>

<comment>I was a registered Democrat who had been voting Republican for a long time and made the switch official so I could vote in primary for Trump. The primary has never mattered before in my late-voting state. Is that somehow unbelievable?</comment>

<comment>A story that someone who would otherwise be voting for a Democrat is instead voting for Trump is unbelievable.</comment>

<comment>Because Reagan Democrats were never a thing....</comment>

<comment>I never said that.  Trump is no Reagan.</comment>

<comment>You don't believe that there's a single Bernie voter, in all of America, who won't vote for Trump if Hillary gets the nomination? Not a single one?</comment>

<comment>I won't.If Bernie isn't nominated I'll be voting Green again, which can be interesting in my state as the Greens didn't make the ballot in the last election. I had to write Jill Stein's name in.</comment>

<comment>What state are you in? The Greens and Jill Stein were on 40-some ballots, I believe. Some of us voted for a woman president in 2012.</comment>

<comment>Missouri.I'm not sure why she wasn't on my ballot, but it took me about ten minutes of wrangling in my head.  In the end I just couldn't vote for Obama, because I consider him to be a war criminal.</comment>

<comment>I like people better than animals. Well most people except maybe eco terrorists Green voters.</comment>

<comment>And this is why I can be reasonably sure you aren't a liberal.  You're speaking authoritatively from a place of willful ignorance, a fond pastime for lazy neoconservatives.</comment>

<comment>I'm not ideological! Why is this so difficult for people to understand?</comment>

<comment>Well, if that's the case, I'd ask that you quit repeating information that can be verified just by reading his plans.</comment>

<comment>So basically you won't make a meaningful decision.No courage in that and no real responsibility.</comment>

<comment>That's your opinion, but realistically, a vote for Hillary is a vote for neocon. (Her very theatrical displays on social issues notwithstanding.)</comment>

<comment>I promise you, if you vote Green over Dem you will be going directly against the wishes of your chosen candidate.  I love what Bernie is doing but that's in part because it is 1000% certain that he will back the eventual nominee should it not be him.  Naturally I would expect support from Clinton voters should Bernie pull it out, as well.</comment>

<comment>I don't vote based on party affiliation.  I vote based on character and plans, and you couldn't pay me to vote for a supposed liberal that opposes a minimum living wage.</comment>

<comment>Great.  In 2000, it was "there's no difference between the candidates."  4,500 U.S and literally hundreds of thousands of Iraqi dead later, looks like it was a pretty damn big difference after all.  But by all means keep treating presidential politics as an appropriate venue for purity tests.</comment>

<comment>There's an easy solution to the problem you present:  Democrats can behave like Democrats.Then they might get the votes you think they're entitled to, based on nothing more than the letter behind their name.</comment>

<comment>They are entitled to nothing.  Nothing.  But it's a cold and brutal world, and elections have actual consequences for the actual people living within it.Gore wasn't in any way entitled to the 2000 election.  And, had he won, half a million Iraqis wouldn't have died in an unnecessary war.  I'm sorry but that calculation does mean more than a dorm-room debate over whether he acted sufficiently "like a Democrat."</comment>

<comment>I actually disagree with that assertion, because it's unprovable, and Democrats have proven themselves as ready and willing to make war as Republicans. (They just invented prettier euphemisms to cover it.)As for acting like a Democrat, I refer to LBJ, Teddy, and FDR.  There was a time when a Democrat winning was actually a win.  Now?  We can't even find an 'electable' Democrat that is willing to fight for a living wage, much less the massive economic and tax reforms we need.</comment>

<comment>Well, I suspect that our politics are actually very similar. (I like Bernie a lot).  But yeah, we'll have to disagree that Gore would have invaded Iraq; that  required a concerted, willful twisting of the rationale that I see no evidence that Gore would have undertaken.</comment>

<comment>That's likely because Saddam had not threatened to kill his father and he would have realized that Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.  Hillary, in contrast is more gung ho for military intervention not only based on her vote for the Iraq War but also her advocacy of a no fly zone against ISIS which unlike Russia has no planes.</comment>

<comment>Trump isn't the number two choice of Sanders supporters.</comment>

<comment>Any Sanders supporter who cares about American workers ought to prefer Trump to a corrupt Goldman-Sachs puppet.I actually talked up Sanders on this board LONG before either he OR Trump  decided to run, for his opposition to H1-B.</comment>

<comment>You're right. I'm better.</comment>

<comment>I feel 100% certain that Trump believes that. Better than Jesus too.</comment>

<comment>I am a Democrat who voted for Obama, but this last term, his true colors of being a "Do Nothing" president could not be denied.  Many people believed in him and turned his back on the American people for his Elitist friends and special interests.  And Golf, and Hawaii of course.  So now that the DNC has effectively buried the Bernie Sanders campaign, I have changed my  voter registration to Republican so that I can vote for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Thinking that Obama would have been able to pass any meaningful legislation through this Republican House shows a drastic lack of understanding of your political system.  Or, more likely, you're not really a Democrat who voted for Obama, since you're playing up the 'golf' meme.</comment>

<comment>So you, who said that the "extremist left which has marched to a beat of elitist arrogance that holds the American public in contempt," (bit.ly/1QlifHN) were going to vote for Bernie Sanders?Okay, I have to wonder what it is you think Obama failed at achieving that you think Trump would be more successful with.  Which policies?</comment>

<comment>Same here.</comment>

<comment>That's cute, as it works in-character too!</comment>

<comment>way to go!  Make America classy again.</comment>

<comment>You switched from D to R? What a coincidence--so did Trump!</comment>

<comment>Tribal Loyalty > Ideological Loyalty</comment>

<comment>I have also switched from D to R to vote for Trump.Especially now that the Hillary DNC Elitist Establishment appears to have silenced Bernie Sanders.There are plenty of people who are going to do this.Come the general election, you will see a sea of people migrating from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party just to vote for Trump.The American Middle Class needs to have someone who will fight for them.</comment>

<comment>It is a most amusing experience watching the Republican Establishment squirm at the rapid rise of Trump.It is the result of decades pandering and the so called Southern Strategy pioneered by Nixon. </comment>

<comment>SouthernStrategy meme</comment>

<comment>Except, not really. The Southern Strategy was against Blacks. Trump is more against foreigners. It's a bad analysis.</comment>

<comment>It's tapping the same vein of resentment of outsiders, be they brown or black.</comment>

<comment>Is Trump talking forced busing or states rights?</comment>

<comment>You do understand that things can be similar without being identical, don't you?</comment>

<comment>In this case, those things are neither similar nor identical. Trump hasn't really gone after Blacks all that much.</comment>

<comment>Same tactics, same audience, just targeting a new set of outsiders as scapegoats.</comment>

<comment>Except yeah, really. They're both based in bigotry against entire groups of people regardless of merit.</comment>

<comment>Only if you believe borders don't matter.</comment>

<comment>Then vote Rubio, immigration based on merit not nepotism.Bigotry? Many people have their self interest spill into political opinions and that has little to do with prejudice but with the ability to see more than the immediate and individual reward but the long term and community reward. If you see it that way being anti illegal immigration is an act of love.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders will raise taxes by $500 for our families for universal health care. This then saves all families stress, grief and $5,000 in private health insurance costs annually. This simplifies the system for all families and all businesses too.He will also break up the big banks so they do not collapse the economy again.He will also gear up the United States towards fully renewably powered, off fossil fuels, towards bidirectional electric vehicles. New wind is now 2.5 cents a kilowatt hour sold to competitive US utilities and new solar is now 5 cents a kilowatt hour beating everything else on cost and speed alone.Bernie's economic policies would raise median income by $22,000. Drop unemployment to 3.8%. Create 26 million new jobs. Grow the economy by 5.3% every year.If you have better and more accurate numbers please share.YouTube. February 10, 2016. "Economist Explains Why a Bernie Economy Would Soar". YouTube. February 24, 2015. "Bernie Sanders Keeps Rising In National Polls"</comment>

<comment>You forgot to mention the reasonable cost of your Panda Insurance.</comment>

<comment>What is Panda Insurance? I do not have a panda. How is this relevant?</comment>

<comment>See the comment that was (coincidently) posted right after yours (now hidden).  It's stealth spam for some shady company called Insurance Panda.  They bury their plugs in comments that consistently have a length, cadence and content similar to your comment.</comment>

<comment>Ok, thank you for the clarification. Those shameless advertisements are annoying for citizens trying to find solutions to large scale problems based on real issues.</comment>

<comment>"Grow the economy by 5.3% every year"Jeb! was rightly laughed out of the room by economist of all stripes when he promised 4% annual growth.  And you're claiming Bernie's gonna get 5.3% annual growth?  China can't even produce those numbers with a straight face anymore.  http://www.tradingeconomics.co...The US hasn't produced those numbers in 40 years.$500 per family will pay for universal health care?  While also raising median income by $22,000.  So nurses and other health care worker are going to get a $22k raise and health costs are going to go down. What are these 26,000,000 new jobs going to be?  Who will be paying these 26,000,000 people?  Enthusiasm is good.  Reality check math is better.</comment>

<comment>It'll never work if you don't believe, Brian. Get with the program.</comment>

<comment>Please bring and review good data based on sound science to get onboard with the program.</comment>

<comment>China was growing at 10% annually. In 2015, China grew at 7% while their coal consumption and their associated emissions peaked and decreased by 3%.I invite others to review and provide better numbers. What is Trump's projected numbers for the same categories?In my view Trump and Sanders will debate each other. After 45 min Trump will order two comfy chairs for on stage, a bottle of champagne and two glasses then they will both sit down to plan out the Sanders administration for full renewables, full employment caused by circular economy policies, cradle to cradle industries and industrial carbon reversal.</comment>

<comment>Hillary's going to lose in a landslide.Can't wait.</comment>

<comment>I'm not a Trump fan and I'm pretty sure I'll vote for Hillary. But I won't mind much if The Donald does actually gain the WH for the simple reason he's not a conservative. I'm just hoping the GOP base and his other supporters do not wake up to that.</comment>

<comment>WOW, someone just articulated what I've been thinking for months! If you look back at The Donald's life, he has never been a so-called conservative. Does anyone truly believe that he is a homophobe or dyed in the wool racist?</comment>

<comment>Probably not. Just a garden-variety a$$hole and bully with a genius for garnering publicity for himself by appealing to actual homophobes and racists.</comment>

<comment>A rather strange article. Since  its pretty obvious that most of the "Republican establishment" is  now supporting Rubio [I personaly  am a Kasich  fan.   ] The author  is only able to mention two politicians and two ordinary individuals to support his premise that the Republican establishment is supporting Trump. Whereas pretty much all evidence points to the fact that the Republican Establishment is in full panic about the prospect of Trump winning the nomination</comment>

<comment>Right. "Support" isn't the right way to describe it, but perhaps some of the Establishment are coming around to "resigned."  Try as I might I just can't visualize The Donald as my Prez.</comment>

<comment>And I can not imagine that human cuspidor, Bill's wife, being my POTUS.</comment>

<comment>Then you probably should not cast your vote for her.</comment>

<comment>Killary is the DC doormat.</comment>

<comment>There are plenty of Republicans who will also refuse to vote for Trump should he get the nomination.  His radical, uncompromising "positions" alienate moderates, he exhibits little understanding of actual policy, and his crude, insulting nature shows that he does not have the dignity to hold the office of president.</comment>

<comment>I want to see the people who left the US when Bush or Obama won. People do and say things in the heat of the moment they do not truly mean -or are able to carry through.</comment>

<comment>Never said I was leaving the US.  I just will not submit my vote in support of someone who would be better off going back to hosting reality TV shows.</comment>

<comment>I didn't accuse you...The more I understand how complicated and convoluted it is to rule effectively the more difficult it is to decide who to vote for. I am all for a paternalistic dictatorship or a oligarchy based on certain merits but that would be playing with fire more than our present two party democratic system.</comment>

<comment>I understand that media sites like their clickys -- but Trump is not going to be the republican nominee. There is no way he will get over 50% of delegates, and the non-Trump forces will coalesce at the convention.</comment>

<comment>Aristocrats have a history of Flight, not Fight.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a force of nature.</comment>

<comment>"Anybody but Hillary""Anybody but Obama""Anybody but Gore"...Seems the Right is, like their stars Rubio and Trump, repeating themselves...</comment>

<comment>I'm inevitable.</comment>

<comment>Duncan HunterJim WebbDr. CarsonAll people Mr. Trump should pull for his Cabinet.</comment>

<comment>Jim Webb as Sec Def would be awesome. I love it when military leaders are actual badashes. </comment>

<comment>Leadership by example. It's a good thing.Mr. Webb received the Navy Cross, the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars and both unit and campaign awards. Oh and the Navy Achievement Award. One of the Marine Corps most decorated Marines. Separated due to injuries received he then went on to law school and to serve as VA Senator. Wow.</comment>

<comment>American voters are rejecting the corrupt political insiders.Trump tapped into the emotion of the voters.Killary will lose hugely because every dimcrat has already rejected her as a corrupt geriatric insider.</comment>

<comment>I'm not a "Killary" supporter, but your assessment is incorrect.  She won Nevada, and she's going to win South Carolina.  If every "dimcrat" had rejected her, that would be reflected by the primary results.</comment>

<comment>Killary lost in 2008 for good reasons.Now she is older, fatter, weaker and mired in more scandal.</comment>

<comment>And this still does not change the fact your assessment is wrong.  She's won in two states.  And whether you wish to acknowledge this or not, the Democratic Party is conservative in that it wants to maintain the status quo of its electoral chances.  Backing a 74 year old socialist does not maintain the status quo, and in a right-of-center country such as ours, Sanders would get killed in a general election.Incidentally, Trump is older than Hillary by one year.</comment>

<comment>Lowest dimcrats turnout in decades.</comment>

<comment>She won.  She's going to win.  Obsess about someone else, preferably younger and hotter.</comment>

<comment>She continues to sink.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...sink all the way to the nomination.  And then we have a nasty little choice on our doorstep: a duplicitous, ultimate insider, or a nationalist, ill tempered demagogue.  What a country we live in.</comment>

<comment>I lean to the corrupt lady with the competent corrupt "husband."  The demagogue scares me.  I don't think she's any bargain, but she's not nuts, and Bill will be there to help.Of course, the GOP is as pathological about her corruption as they are about Obama's competence.  Bengahzi(tm) is not about a nefarious plot to kill a diplomat, it's about competence.  By concentrating on the fever dreams of their wildest fantasies, the GOP has made any real criticism of Hillary seem like Tin Foil hat stuff.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that's how I feel, too.The good news, if you want to call it that, is Trump's blown up the modern GOP as we know it.  It has been exposed for what it is: a deeply radical, highly ideological fundamentalist movement.  The problem, however, is we don't know what's going to take its place.  And that's a scary thought...</comment>

<comment>The biggest problem is that 30% of the American people really believe in that nonsense, and 15 to 20% more will accept it rather than the establishment Democrat.  This unhinged radical could hold the nuclear button.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure if he'll get to the Oval if Hillary is the nominee.  As you've duly noted, she's not nuts, and the Clinton machine knows how to campaign during a general election season.Now, is this something I look forward to?  Hardly.  Hillary is the least bad option.  Robert Kagen over at The Washington Post is already on record saying if it's a Trump/Hillary contest, he's voting for Hillary.  Not that he's a fan of the Democrats, but he sees her at the least bad option.</comment>

<comment>Nationalist wins in a landslide!</comment>

<comment>Trump represents the opposite of what the Founders intended.  As such, Trump cannot be considered a "conservative" candidate, either philosophically or in temperament.</comment>

<comment>Lol. Let them be.They still think Killary is electable.</comment>

<comment>But I have All this salt and they have all those wounds.It seems like rubbing it in makes best use of both.</comment>

<comment>Have at it. They're children</comment>

<comment>If he was truly waving the anti establishment flag high and proud, you'd think that DT would be telling these career politicians to pump sand when they want to jump off their sinking ships.All they want is their shingle hung on the WH and they're prepared to compromise each of their principles and platforms to get it.</comment>

<comment>Christie for Veep.Thanks guys.</comment>

<comment>The vote for Trump is simple.  The middle class has been decimated in every aspect of their life.  They (we) are simply voting for food and shelter and jobs and a decent wage.  Trump is speaking to them and they are responding.  It's really that simple.</comment>

<comment>TRUMP will be the next President. TRUMP’s opponents have nothing to offer but their arrogant condescending attitudes towards the voting population. These cookie-cutter politicians, and their obsolete old-boy establishment handlers, are wrong for today’s challenges and tomorrows solutions. Don’t waste voter’s time and energy trying to make this election about personalities, gender, race, minorities, religion and hatred. Trust in the voters, stop insulting them. Do so at your own peril.The many debates heading into Super Tuesday will confirm TRUMP’s presidential qualities and demonstrate the lack of qualities in the other candidates. Eminent Domain didn’t stick to TRUMP and neither will groundless tax allegations. The two stooge’s failure to dethrone TRUMP will also insure   TRUMP obtains the GOP nomination. It’s a slam dunk, TRUMP will own Super Tuesday.The condescending elitist career politicians, their crony establishment, and their special interest lobbyists are destroying America. These career politicians and their disastrous decisions resulted in the exportation of millions of American jobs and destroyed America’s manufacturing infrastructure. Today American youth carry enormous debts and can’t find jobs.  America’s middle class is shrinking daily. America’s voters have had enough. TRUMP’s final opponent has been in the thick of these disasters for the past thirty years and she cannot and will not escape voters’ scorn and revolt.Breaking NEWS: TRUMP is not responsible for other candidates’ and previous government failures. American voters couldn’t care less about party affiliations. Today American voters want to reverse the export of jobs, manufacturing and money out of America. Americans want a health care system that works for ALL Americans. Americans want to deal with terrorism and illegal immigration once and for all. Americans want the right leader with a vision that embraces measurable achievable solutions that focus on taking back America for ALL Americans. The political establishment’s endless disasters, at home and abroad, have failed Americans, not TRUMP. TRUMP, and his voting supporters will take back America for all Americans and they will make America great again.On November the 8th the majority of voters will choose TRUMP as their next President. TRUMP has surrounded himself with the right people for business and TRUMP will surround himself with the right people as President.  As president, TRUMP will work very hard for ALL Americans repairing America’s domestic and international disasters. Take back America for ALL Americans. Make America great again. Be a part of the solution. Please vote, Make your vote count. Vote for TRUMP.The first amendment protects the freedom of the press and every American. When the media and the press promote their personal hidden agendas by lying and by censuring and or pre-moderating comments, they don’t agree with, they themselves are sadly violating the first amendment. Maybe now you finally understand TRUMP’s appeal by voters across all demographics. SHAME ON YOU!</comment>

<comment>Well, now, who would've ever thunk it that Jeb's supporters would move over to support Trump????Never in a million gazillion years!</comment>

<comment>The people supporting Trump are doing so precisely because they're sick of the establishment politicians.  If Trump let's them into his inner circle and let's them make policy for him, he'll lose the people who have supported him so far.  I wouldn't waste my gas money to drive to the polls to vote for another establishment/Chamber of Commerce candidate.</comment>

<comment>I too decided to register as a republican.  I've been independent for 40+ years but can't help myself this time.  The GOP cultivated the ignorance, now it is time to harvest the ignorance.</comment>
