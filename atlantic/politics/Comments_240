<comment>Too bad there's no such thing as "contempt of the Constitution".The good news is that not only will the GOP lose the presidency, but they're probably going to lose control of the Senate as well.Have fun seating Obama on the Supreme Court next year, guys....</comment>

<comment>Being a Supreme Court Justice requires WORK.  Not to mention, he'd rather globe trot making speeches for more money than Granny Clinton ever dreamed of making.  Obama will be all about becoming rich.</comment>

<comment>If you want Obama to work harder, elect smarter Republicans. Because McConnell is getting played like a deck of cards, and Obama isn't even breathing hard.</comment>

<comment>It is too bad.  Obama would have been convicted of it YEARS ago.  You are truly deluded.</comment>

<comment>Why is it that those all about the Constitution aren't so about it when it's not so convenient?</comment>

<comment>"Too bad there's no such thing as contempt of the Constitution.". . . The constitution deserves contempt.  Republicans act within the letter of the constitution and see where it leads us.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, there won't be a political price paid.And when President Clinton/Sanders puts up a SC nominee next spring and McConnell says that we should wait for the next President to fill the vacancy, the Mainstream media will say its the same as the Bork nomination and just enable the Republican dysfunction.Damn, I am cynical today.</comment>

<comment>Bork did not deserve to be a Justice because of the "Saturday Night Massacre".Hang in there baby - I am also battling troll fever.</comment>

<comment>Notice that Reagan followed Bork's nomination with a centrist that won a Democrat controlled Senate 97-0 who is now a Democrat darling.  Obama will never nominate a centrist.  He's afraid if he did he'd lose a wedge issue for the election.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your reply.  I am thinking a "centrist" is a candidate judge that has a track record of rulings that were based on facts/precedents not politics.  Would you please expand/explain the term "wedge issue" and what you think it might be for 2016.  I keep thinking back to 2000 and that fiasco without a majority vote in SCOTUS.  I think Alito has stated that the court will function without Scalia or his replacement seated - that is some comfort.</comment>

<comment>Did the Democratic darling voted for Citizen United?  Yes.  Therefore, no darling, you can stick Kennedy where the sun doesn't shine.</comment>

<comment>One suspects that if Congress refuses to obey the Constitution well into 2018, they will lose their jobs.Or maybe the Republicans will learn that the Constitution no longer matters, and simply stage a coup.On a related note: I get my Australian citizenship in a week. So, I'm good. Sucks to be you guys, though. :(</comment>

<comment>Meh.Why should the government of the U.S. actually work? That wasn't actually in the founding documents (so far as I know), so stasis and inaction is perfectly reasonable as a path of action.It's not like there's anything that actually needs doing in the U.S. so what the heck. How about everyone go home on an 11 month long vacation? I mean, might as well right? Why bother showing up for this nonsense and pretend "governing?"Whatevs man. Whatevs.</comment>

<comment>The rethugs are signing their own death warrant. When Bernie Sanders takes power he will ram socialism down their throats so hard that they won't stop gagging.</comment>

<comment>And sadly enough neither will the citizens.</comment>

<comment>Of course, one of the major reasons the GOP has continually avoided paying any kind of political price for this kind of chicanery is insipid 'both sides do it' pieces by intellectually lazy journalists who are more interested in writing stories demonstrating they don't understand how US politics work than critiquing public policy. Good thing no-one can criticise Fournier for that...</comment>

<comment>Come on, Joe Biden made a hypothetical comment 24 years ago! Both sides do it!Vote Republican!</comment>

<comment>This was far from being a hypothetical comment. It was a senior Senator expressing the direction of the party on nominations of Supreme Court Justices. What rolls around comes around.https://youtu.be/oVvxGa0zhWo</comment>

<comment>Seeing as how there was no vacancy at the time, it was by definition a hypothetical comment.  And just ten minutes after saying it, he said it was possible that a Bush nominee could win his support if it was a moderate pick.  So, you know, exactly the opposite of what current Republicans are saying now.</comment>

<comment>It should also be noted that Biden's sentiments were those of a solitary senator;  not the TOTALITY of the democrats on the Senate Judicial Committee.</comment>

<comment>It should be noted that in Biden's case, he was speaking at the end of June, when there was significantly less time before the election. And he was making a hypothetical argument, based on the integrity of institutions - his idea was that a nomination/ nomination fight that late in the presidency, would be damaging to the procedural norms governing the interaction of the Branches. With just four months to go to the next election, he probably had a point. But with NINE months? With that much time, the same argument clearly goes the other way. The Republicans are trying to set a precedent which they themselves will never abide by.</comment>

<comment>Did Republicans agree with Biden then?</comment>

<comment>Turn about is fair play! Finally the GOP got something right.Ted Cruz for Supreme Court Justice!</comment>

<comment>Ah, the 2 wrongs make a right argument...  how compelling.Besides the inconsistencies in context pointed out above (making it debateable whether it actually is equivelent), do you actually believe there should be principles for governing, or should it really just be about whatever the politics dictate?</comment>

<comment>Patrick Leahy blocked dozens of Bush's court appointees from 2001 to 2005. That was Bush's first term and not hypothetical. During that period, Leahy and Reid told us over and over that the Senate had no responsibility to ever hold a hearing unless they wanted to.What goes around, comes around. Since the Supreme Court has effectively declared itself a permanent ad-hoc Constitutional Convention, it is far too important not to fight over. Lame Duck Obama does not get to pack the court with a third lock-step liberal.</comment>

<comment>I swear to god you can be astonishingly myopic.  Yeah, both sides do it; but the GOP has consistently taken obstruction to the extreme.  It used to be that both sides blocked nominations for candidates they perceived as extreme.  But once Obama took office, Republicans began to routinely block or delay ALL nominations.You should be pissed that either side does it, not looking for excuses why it's OK for your side to do it.http://www.pfaw.org/press-rele...</comment>

<comment>You either.I don't; recall much from this side of the fence while "their" folks were doing it.As mentioned prior I don't recall the author penning articles about how unfair it was for then Senator Obama filibustering a nominee even he thought was perfectly qualified for wholly political reasons.</comment>

<comment>"I don't recall....therefore it must never have happened."  Nice tautologyDid Obama actually block a nomination?  Or did he use the occasion for some grandstanding after which the nomination proceeded?  If you can't grasp the difference between the occasional grandstanding-by-filibuster (or whatever mechanism) and the intentional ceasing/delay of ALL approvals because of purely political reasons, then I'm not sure what value there is in having a debate.It's hard for politicians to avoid being political and partisan.  I may not like it, but I accept it will happen to some degree, and it will happen on each side.  But the point is that the GOP has dialed it up to 11 and taken obstruction far, far beyond mere partisanship.  It's a matter of degree.  They have politicized the judiciary in an unprecedented way, and that will cause lasting damage.</comment>

<comment>Did it in fact happen?I did a LexisNexis search for the author BTW and found nothing of the sort I commented on. Maybe I missed it? And you of course can link me to the ire you expressed at the time right? You seem to be confusing a figure of speech/qualified statement,  for something else entirely. But points for "tautology." ;)Yes, he tried his best to block a nominee that even he thought was perfectly qualified. He failed, but that does mean he isn't a hypocrite.And perhaps MM is "grandstanding" as well. Note that you give the benefit of the doubt to Obama but not MM.Nope, as the OP you responded to pointed out, this ain't new or isolated. Or any different. That is the Lefty narrative. And the Left only feels that way when people treat them the way they treat other people.Heck in context look at what Lefties did to Justice Thomas.It was so bad that Thomas, a black man, referred to it as a "high tech lynching."And talk about hypocrisy, if the standard of evidence for Bill Clintons actions with women was the same for the claims about Thomas--Bill would be in jail. </comment>

<comment>"...this ain't new or isolated. Or any different."It isn't new.  Both sides do it; both sides have done it; both sides will continue to do it.  On that much we agree.  I'm not defending anyone from a charge of hypocrisy.But your entire argument rests on an assertion that the degree of obstruction has been consistent--that judges are blocked or approved equally, whether nominated by a Republican or a Democrat.   That's an objective standard.  If that is indeed the case then you should be able to easily provide objective evidence to support your position.I'm open to being corrected.  Please provide some evidence that approval of judicial nominations has been consistent over the past few decades, that it "ain't...any different."</comment>

<comment>And i disagree that:A-the exact "degree" is all that relevant.  The implicit meaning of "degree" in context is that its largely/mainly the same.B-that its even different by "degree." If you say its not then you should be able to provide proof of that.  Recall the FIRST claim was yours above--therefore Burden of Proof is on you. ;)But while we are one the subject, from 2001 to 2003 the D-Senate refused to even hold hearings on Bush nominees. The same thing they are screaming about now.And in the 108th Congress, when the GOP retook the Senate, the Democrats filibustered 10 nominees, TEN people, to prevent a VOTE being taken.C-Why narrow it to JUST "judicial nominations?" The charge is "obstruction" and hypocrisy IN GENERAL---trying to narrow the scope to one area is tacit admission that general charge is valid. ;)D-Like I said, the "obstruction" of  Justice Thomas alone is more than proof of Leftist hypocrisy.Thomas is black, and the Left holds themselves out as supporters of blacks. Yet they applied, in his own words, a "high tech lynching" to him.The Left applied a VERY different standard of evidence to try and block Thomas than they did Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Oh, degree doesn't matter now.  I see.   Frustrating the eventual, successful confirmation of one judge is "largely/mainly the same" as the unprecedented decision to even consider dozens of nominations.   I'll keep that in mind for our future exchanges.Seriously, what possible rationale can you provide that "degree" doesn't matter?  I provided a link in my response to the OP.    Here's another.And it isn't just judicial nominations.  Read the article you're commenting on.</comment>

<comment>Ah....."degree" was YOUR word. If you don't like it, don't use it.In terms of "rational" I was pretty specfic. Please read my post.In general terms, as an example 95 is MORE than 93. But its still quite a lot (out of 100)And as mentioned in terms of "judical nominations" AGAIN, YOUR SPECIFC EXAMPLE. From 2001 to 2003 the Democrats refused to hold hearings for nominees--the exact thing thing they are now screaming about.And when the R took over in the 108th the Democrats  resorted to fillibustering 10/TEN people to avoid giving them an "up or down" vote. The exact "up or down" vote the President is now asking for. Which BTW he denied as Senator Obama.And no, its NOT just "judcial nominations" the Left was obstrucionist and hypocritical on. Which was MY point.</comment>

<comment>I like "degree."  I think it's apt.  In fact, it's the entire point.You're the one who thinks it doesn't matter yet won't defend why it doesn't matter.Just to confirm: is it your assertion that no Bush judicial nominees had a hearing between 2001 and 2003.  Do you mean not one?  Or do you mean some?  And if it's some, then what percentage of nominations?</comment>

<comment>Actually I was more than specfic as to why "degree" is misplaced. Again, the word itself rather strongly implies that the differences between things are slight.To use it in context, is IMO tacit admission that its, forgive the the term" "nitpicky" ;) instead of substantive.As in you only hit me 10 times instead of 11.Well as per the wiki page, zero. Do I trust wiki? Not really.But if you have different information and think the distinction matters in context happy to discuse it. What percentage of nominees being refused a hearing is acceptable to you? Or blocked by filibuster and not granted an "up or down" vote?Please remember that NO/ZERO Obama nominee has ACTUALLY been denied a hearing either. Just some tough talk from MM about not doing so.Its why, as mentioned repeatedly, that this whole discussion is simply hysteria and "in theory" based arguments.Argument, "in theory" or  otherwise is fine, I enjoy it. Can't say the same about the hysteria however.</comment>

<comment>My use of degree was not intended to suggest mere minor magnitude.  Something can be different to a small degree, or to a large degree.  Thus, it's a matter of degree as to whether what that GOP is threatening (and has already engaged in) is significantly different from the same shitty practices of the Democrats.  I'm suggesting it is. Here are some data  for approval/rejection of judicial nominations for five presidents (1977-2003).  You can see a couple things:  1) The obstruction accelerates meaningfully during Clinton's terms, and; 2) GW Bush had 168 of his U.S. District and Circuit Court nominees in 2001-2003 confirmed.  That's nearly 80%, a far cry from "zero."According to  this article, approval of Obama's nominees came to a virtual halt just as soon as Republicans had control of the Senate.  Again, my point is that the GOP's actions are without precedent and certainly not "exactly" what was done by Democrats.  </comment>

<comment>Nope, its really not. If you are using the term "degree" its almost by definition NOT "significant"Except that is  "confirmed" EVENTUALLY not how many were held up by not having hearings or blocked by filibuster at the time.And, not for nothing that  gives the GOP a 20% refusal rate in keeping with the argument that is "ok by you.As per the ABA July 26,of 2004, 10 judicial nominees were refused an "up or down" vote.Of course its not "exactly" what is "exact" to that extent? Even "identical twins" are not "exact." But for all practical purpose the behavior between the right and left is "exact" enough for government work.I don't click links anymore. Bad experience. Please cite the source and point  properly if you want to use it.And all to often the links clicked are not quite what the linker claims.As an example I have no idea what you specifically referring to in a 47 PAGE report--but I did notice some stuff that is counter to your claims. (the report is old news) And on your 2nd link its specifically says this has been going on for "decades."Like I said, despite MM tough talk NOBODY has actually been denied anything, yet. How is that substantively different than the President saying he is going veto legislation he has not even read?And if Obama had his way as a Senator then far fewer people would have made it through---again, you don't get to use things he  TRIED to and failed as an example.That is BTW because unlike Obama Reagan, Clinton, Bush/s knew how deal with people. As mentioned Obama's divisive behavior and "I have the votes" approach to leadership has resulted in his chickens coming home to roost. </comment>

<comment>degree (noun): the amount, level, or extent to which something happens or is present.  A stage in a scale of intensity or amount.  It's like "volume."  If I told you I spilled a volume of water, you can't infer whether I spilled a  thimbleful or a truckload.You're tossing up dust in your defense.  The report I cite is an "old" report?  You specifically cited 2001-2003 as years when "the Democrats refused to hold hearings for (Bush's) nominees." I provided you with Senate report showing that to be false.  Are you suggesting that the number of nominations/filibusters/confirmations that happened in 2001-2003 isn't static?  Will a newer report tell a different story?      You tell me that no one "has been denied anything yet."  The Atlantic article you're commenting on specifically mentions the Senate's refusal "to act on any of Obama’s nominees before the Senate Banking Committee."  The NYT article specifically mentions that the judicial appointment process virtually came to a halt in December 2015.Regardless, your position appears to be that once the transgression has occurred there are no hold barred--no threshold beyond which such obstruction is unacceptable.  If the Democrats win the Senate and refuse a single hearing for any of President Rubio's nominees, you'll understand and accept that it's just the natural progression of politics.  You may not like it but you won't complain because you're not a hypocrite.  I get it.</comment>

<comment>And in that case, not knowing if its "thumblefull" or  a "truckload" " it would not be a question of "degree." ;)No, I said it was an old report, meaning that its been out there a while--not that its not relevant......before you jump to conclusions about what I "mean" why not just ask me? You could not be more wrong here.And nope, the Senate report does not show that---its shows EVENTUAL appointees, not who had been held up when and for how long or how. Its 47 PAGES long. If there is something specific you want me to read, then cite it properly.The period ABA report I posted says it was 10 people BTW.Maybe, but I'm specifically referencing his SCOTUS appointments. Not every claim of the article.And--I seem to recall that he got to appoint 2 SCOTUS Justices, that ain't "virtually came to a halt." That's 2 extremely powerful positions.AGAIN the article YOU LINKED also said that stuff like this has been going on for "decades."  So by your OWN article its not quite as its presented by the you.And another reason why I hate argument-by-link.No, my position is that Obama's chickens are coming home to roost. HIs "I have the votes" style of leadership has been horribly divisive. And now he has to deal with the bad will his actions have created.</comment>

<comment>I'll go with the dictionary definition, thanks. But you do you.I still don't understand your point on the "old report."  Not only does it contradict your assertion, it provides plenty of of context for when all the shenanigans on judicial began.  I was referencing Table 2(b) but the same data are shown in tables 3 & 4.  You didn't provide a URL for the ABA report and I couldn't find it so I'm not sure what the 10 people is in reference to.And, yeah, it's bigger than just SCOTUS nominations.  That's another point to be made.  It's not just the number of judges blocked, it's the effect on the courts and the vacancies.  Bush left with low vacancy percentages; Obama will leave with relatively high percentages.Yes, it has been happening for decades; each term worse than the one before it.  Tit-for-Tat.  I've acknowledged that from the start and held Democrats (of which I am not one) responsible for their share of the escalation.  My point is back to your favorite word: degree.  Replace it with "magnitude" or "intensity" if that helps.  The magnitude of the GOP obstruction is unprecedented.  That's my point.You acknowledge it's gone on for decades but then lay blame entirely at the feet of Obama.  Which is it?  In your mind, is the GOP entirely justified in how their handling this?</comment>

<comment>I just meant that its an old report. Nothing more.And no it really does not. Again what specifically in the 47 PAGES of it are you referring to?The 10 people that as per the Bar Association of that date and month--which I referenced BTW, that were not given a vote. URL should not be needed.Not really and again the term "relatively" is kinda the point--its another way to say  "degree."And no its not, the Dems left SCOTUS with only 8 members for a time when they refused to confirm during the Nixon Admin. Obama personally tried to block a nominee he himself said was qualified. The "high tech lynching" of Justice Thomas etc etc.So no, none of it is "unprecedented." Depending of course on just how narrowly you define the term.Your OWN link said it had been going on for "decades."No, I'm RESPONDING TO "all the blame being laid at the feet" of the GOP.A very different thing.</comment>

<comment>Again: Table 2(b), or Table 3, or Table 4.  Any of them, all of them."The 10 people that as per the Bar Association of that date and month--which I referenced BTW, that were not given a vote. URL should not be needed."  Shouldn't be needed but I still can't find anything.  Per the Bar Association what?.  Not sure it matters because it's clear from CRS report that treatment of Bush nominees was clearly better than what is occurring now.Did the Dems refuse to even meet with Nixon's nominees?  Or did they give them hearings?  If Obama nominates an ideologue, I'd have no problem with the GOP-controlled Senate rejecting him/her after a confirmation hearing.  That's how the system is supposed to work.   We'll see whether the GOP holds to their threats.If you can point out where I've laid blame entirely at the feet of the GOP, please let me know.  I think I've been pretty fair in holding both sides accountable for escalating this.  My concern is that if the GOP follows through on their rhetoric regarding a SCOTUS nominee, they'll have elevated the ongoing politicization of the judiciary in a very public way, and that's a big problem.Packing it in.  Hasta la vista CXT</comment>

<comment>And what page of the 47 PAGES are they? And how exactly do they refute which point?As mentioned, as far as I'm aware it just lists who was EVENTUALLY confirmed, not how long they waited or how they were blocked prior.The ABA is the American Bar Association. And it matters because the treatment was quite similar, "better" being a relative/degree etc term.You can fined the PDF in the reference section of the Wiki page on the Bush Judicial Nominee Contraversy (sp) page.What is the practical difference between refusing to confirm any nominee and refusing having a hearing about confirming? The end result is exactly the same. Up to and including leaving SCOTUS with only 8 members. Its like the difference between being stabbed to death and shot to death. The result is one is dead either way. How one is slain seems of secondary importance to BEING slain.And as mentioned as of right now its just tough talk. And what is the practical difference between that and Obama threating to veto legislation he has not even read?Its not "you" alone, its the general thrust of the comments and article we are commenting on.Its not that different than Obama personally trying to block an nominee even he thought was qualified or the "high tech lynching" given to Justice Thomas. etc etc.The politization IS very bad for the Republic, As is the politization of SCOTUS. But its not going to be fixed by casting ones political rivals being mainly to blame for what is bi-partisan problems. </comment>

<comment>Starting on page 17.  Strikes me as very self explanatory.  The blocked nominations are represented in the tables.  When a president doesn't get 100% of their nominations confirmed (which never happens) it's usually because they're filibustered or voted down during confirmation.  That happens with every president, though, again, it started to get bad during Clinton's terms and further escalated during Bush's terms.I'll leave that without comment.  Glad to hear you agree it's a problem.  I'm done for the night--catch you another time, cxt.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. I 'll check it out---ok checked it out and it makes no sense1-the referenced table only show EVENTUAL confirmation etc. not who was blocked or fillibusted or for how long.2-The tables on page 16-17 show a distinct decline in confirmations from Carter to W. Bush with W. Bush coming in distinctly below Bill Clinton. The trend  is even specifically stated in the intro to the data tables. So I would expect that trend to continue thu Obama. GOP W. Bush got a distinctly lower percentage of his nominees thu than DNC Clinton.Clinton combined totals page 16,  74.8% and W. Bush 57.1%Clinton combined totals page 17,  84% and W. Bush 78%Which is essentially you proving my point. The DNC plays hardball yet freaks when people do it to them.And no as mentioned, the article itself and most of the comments on this thread overtly and directly "blame the GOP."Which is pretty much SOP for the Atlantic itself.That you seemingly can't see that is part of the problem. And kinda my point.</comment>

<comment>Why would I do that?  That would require me to vote against the economic interests of me and my family.</comment>

<comment>And don't forget Reagan nominated a justice during his last year in office ;)</comment>

<comment>But he was a demi-god.</comment>

<comment>He was also a con man, but we'll have to forgive him for that as it is the number one skill required to be a politician *huge grin*</comment>

<comment>I wonder where the author was when then Senator Obama, advocated filibustering a candidate that he said was perfectly qualified but did not meet his own progressive standards?</comment>

<comment>You mean the filibuster after there was a nominee who went through hearings, and that was easily voted down?</comment>

<comment>Yes, that Obama's  filibuster failed hardly changes the fact that he tried to do what he is now decrying.Namely blocking perfectly qualified candidates for wholly political reasons.In a very real way Obama's chickens are coming home to roost. To borrow a phrase.</comment>

<comment>There is no comparison.  The minority party disagreeing with the nominee is in no way equivalent to the majority stating that there will be no action on any nominee.</comment>

<comment>Right now.  You forgot the right now part.Please state for me the requirement for a co-equal branch of the government to operate on the Presidents time table.And, yes, its pretty much the same idea. Obama just wasn't able to pull it off. But he did try.Lets also not forget the wholly partisan way the ACA was passed, the Left jammed it down everyone's throat wholly because they were the majority at the time.Now they want to acct surprised when they get it treated the same way.</comment>

<comment>McConnell announced within hours of Scalia's passing that there would be no action on any nominee.  That's not Obama's time table.  The Constitution says the President nominates justices.  If the Senate does not offer its advice and consent, it is failing to uphold the Constitution.McConnell can stick to his guns, and pay the price.  When Hillary/Bernie presents a nominee to a Democrat-majority Senate, Fox and friends will put the blame squarely on his shell.</comment>

<comment>And he is perfectly within his rights as the leader of a co-equal branch of government to say when and where such a vote takes place.And nope, please state for me the passage that the Senate MUST "advice and consent" at a time of the Presidents choosing.Pretty sure that a co-equal branch of government is not required to 'advice and consent" on the Presidents timetable.Maybe.But remember government gridlock is feature not a bug.</comment>

<comment>The President...shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law....http://www.heritage.org/consti...Lots of "shall" in there.</comment>

<comment>But no reference as to WHEN they are required to do so.Much less on the personal timetable of the Executive branch of which the are co-equal.</comment>

<comment>McConnell didn't say they would do it later.</comment>

<comment>Didn't say he would NEVER give "advice and consent" either.</comment>

<comment>Actually he did.  And the Judiciary Committee Repubs put it in writing.http://www.washingtontimes.com...</comment>

<comment>Will he walk it back...will cxt admit he was wrong...unlikely...next up distract, deflect and change the goal posts.</comment>

<comment>Nope. Nobody said NEVER. Just not right now.</comment>

<comment>Ok, I'm done.  Good day.</comment>

<comment>Ok, see you.</comment>

<comment>Actually, that is EXACTLY what he said.</comment>

<comment>Right now. Not NEVER EVER.</comment>

<comment>“I agree with the Judiciary Committee’s recommendation that we not have hearings. In short, there will not be action taken.”The guy said he will not do it...period.  You are grasping hard.  I can't wait for the GOP to get blown out in the General Election for their clear obstructionism.</comment>

<comment>Right now.Not that no hearings will be taken ever again. You are being deliberately hysterical.</comment>

<comment>"Not that no hearings will be taken ever again."If they refuse to do it for THIS President then this Congress will be out of session.  In other words they are refusing to do THEIR job.  There is no time table.  They are just not going to do it.And no amount of grasping will explain you out of this.  This is unprecedented in US history, and the GOP is to blame.They blame Obama for being divisive, yet they prove day after day that it wasn't Obama, but them.'You are being deliberately hysterical."Yes, basic logic must be hysterical to you since you don't understand it.</comment>

<comment>Nope, just not right now.The will do their jobs as required by the Consitution when required by the Constutition which is up to them.And they are responding to Obama's divisiveness.</comment>

<comment>Congress has set terms just like the President.  If they don't do it during their term (which ends at the beginning of January 2017) then they haven't performed their job as stated by the Constitition...period.</comment>

<comment>Please cite for me the specific passage of the Constitution that says that.</comment>

<comment>"The Congress shall assemble at least once in every year, and such meeting shall begin at noon on the third day of January, unless they shall by law appoint a different day""On the 3rd of January, the NEW Congress Starts.  Which, by definition, means the PREVIOUS Congress didn't do their job.</comment>

<comment>This 114th United States Congress will never act, according to McConnell.</comment>

<comment>You mean he said the NEVER EVER? Like forever?Quote please and source of that.</comment>

<comment>You realize the 114th Congress has an expiration date, right? He was more florid than "never ever":"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told a group of staunch House conservatives there isn't "a snowball's chance in hell" that he will back down from his opposition to confirming a Supreme Court justice before a new president is elected."http://www.politico.com/story/...No doubt you'll squeal that this wasn't a public statement, so here's as definitive as he's gotten publicly:“This nomination will be determined by whoever wins the presidency in the polls,” Mr. McConnell said. “I agree with the Judiciary Committee’s recommendation that we not have hearings. In short, there will not be action taken.”http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>Which if it was an issue the Constitution would have a clause/passage etc. spelling out that the Senate MUST act in "X" amount of time.But it does not.So?  How is that different than when the President says he will veto legislation prior to even seeing it?And besides, there is NO nomination. Until there is one this whole discussion is wholly theoretical.Now action taken NOW. Not that no action will be taken until the end of time.</comment>

<comment>Did you miss the part where I never claimed till the end of time?</comment>

<comment>So what are you arguing about?</comment>

<comment>You are losing gray matter trying to convince this guy the sky is blue so better move on pal...he has been sprinkled by he GOP fairy dust</comment>

<comment>That he will do it now. he even included a timeframe for his actions. So he clearly is not refusing to do it EVER. Just not now.The color of his face really isn't the point.</comment>

<comment>On to other news, GOP supporters find out Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny are not real...response by one supporter "show me in the Constitution where it says that..."</comment>

<comment>You have already been given the quote. Your refusal to acknowledge what McConnell actually said is amusing, but not helpful. If this is the best argument Republicans can come up with, we Democrats will take it. You just run with that in Nov, OK?</comment>

<comment>And the inability to read and/or the ability to read into it is staggering.The quote can certainly be spun that way. But as pointed out there is significant context involved--and depending on which statement you use MM himself offers a timeframe consistent with the Constitution.Also, as mentioned many times, which you would know if you read the thread---but who am I kidding, reading the thread might challenge the narrative, so of course you won't do it. ;)Anyway, as mentioned many times prior. Politicos say all sorts of things they later "evolve" on.President Obama and gay marriage, that one can keep ones doctor, "Period": That the ACA was not a tax. etc. etc.That argument wouldn't really help. The Constitution simply does not say what you want it to. And you simply don't care.  A win for the narrative over the facts. Sad but not unexpected.</comment>

<comment>But if no hearings were ever done, that would still be technically allowed, right?</comment>

<comment>Don't know, what does the Constitution say?</comment>

<comment>It doesn't say that hearings have to be held ever.  Presumably that means the Senate can effectively eliminate the top tier of one branch of government.</comment>

<comment>Taking cxt's horrible logic to it's conclusion that is exactly what it means.  The Senate can refuse to Advise and Consent at any time forever if they truly want.  They can literally take away one of the greatest powers of the President.The fact that the Constitution says SHALL doesn't factor in...Bad logic is bad.</comment>

<comment>Again, what does the Constitution say?You could just as easily say there is little need for a coequal Senate or House if the President can tell then when and how they must function.They would no longer be co-equal if the President controlled how and when they operate.</comment>

<comment>"You could just as easily say there is little need for coequal Senate or House if the President can tell then when and how they must function."Only with powers that are specifically given to the President.  The Founders made it quite apparent that the President should be making these decisions.'They would no longer be co-equal if the President controlled how and when they operate."This isn't control of when.  He is just saying "do your job."  Which requires doing it at some point, which they have flatly stated they refuse to do.</comment>

<comment>The FOunders said the President should be setting the timetable for how a co-equal branch of government operates?Where specifically?They will do their job, when they, not the President decide.</comment>

<comment>Where is the President setting the time table?  You are so stuck in your horrible line of thinking that you are blinded.  He is just saying do your job.And the fact remains that right now the 114th Congress is refusing to do it at all.  Will the 115th, maybe, but irrelevant.  It still means the 114th is refusing to Advise or Consent.</comment>

<comment>He is asking/demanding it to be done on his schedule. They will do their job on the schedule that a co-equal branch of the government decides.Not when some anonymous person online or when the Executive branch decides is convenient for them.</comment>

<comment>"He is asking/demanding it to be done on his schedule. "All he said was a timely fashion (something given to every other Presidential Supreme Court nominee in history).He didn't demand ANYTHING in regards to a time table.His exact quote"There will be plenty of time for me to do so, and for Senate to fulfill its responsibility to give that person a fair hearing and a timely vote"The fact remains that if the 114th Congress doesn't give Advise or Consent before their term ends, then the 114th Congress will have not met their requirements per the Constitution which states they "SHALL" advise or consent.</comment>

<comment>And the Senate can decide for themselves what is "timely."There is no such requirement in the passage that refers to when.There is no such requirement in the passage that details the when of the "Consent and Advice." </comment>

<comment>Just that they SHALL do it.  So if the 114th doesn't then they haven't met that requirement.  This is very basic logic.</comment>

<comment>And when precisely is "shall?"Again, there is not such timetable in the Constitution. Its just says "shall" not when.And of if you wish to be "logical" as no nomination has been made they are not actually refusing anything YET.Its merely talk until there is an actual nomination made. "logically." ;)</comment>

<comment>You have the patience of Job...you ever read about that in the bible...this guy seems SOS but you must be a good Christian</comment>

<comment>"You could just as easily say there is little need for a coequal Senate or House if the President can tell then when and how they must function."The president can force Congress into session anytime he wants. Article II, Section 3. </comment>

<comment>Can he control when they vote?</comment>

<comment>Yes. He can put them into session and keep them there. </comment>

<comment>Again, can he FORCE them to VOTE?</comment>

<comment>Again, he can force them into session. If they keep refusing to do their job, he can keep them in session as well.Read Article II, Section 3. </comment>

<comment>So he can keep them there. Again, can he force them to vote?Show it to me.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he did say he would NEVER. That's exactly what he said.</comment>

<comment>He said he would NEVER, EVER, until the end of the republic and time itself hold hearings?That is what he said?Citation please.Heck one of his quotes included a time frame of 2017.You seem to be reading a ton into the statement. Esp in context.Also I presume you feel the same about any number President Obamas statements then?</comment>

<comment>Are you using the "sure I said it was for keepsies, but I didn't say for realsies" argument?When you have to go this deep into the weeds to try and make a point, it's a good time to pop you're head up and check your bearings.</comment>

<comment>No, I'm using the "he didn't actually say how its being spun" argument.Along with the "politicos say all kinds of things" argument.Such as Obama's stance on gay marriage or the "you can keep your Doctor. Period" etc etc.</comment>

<comment>Are you  certain?  It sounds exactly like the "sure I said it was for keepsies, but I didn't say for realsies" argument.  It even has the "nahn ahhn" tone fourth graders seem to master so quickly.</comment>

<comment>Hard to get "tone" from a written sentence, but yes, pretty certain that its being spun.If you are going to troll then please step it up. This is the Atlantic after all. Standards people, standards. ;)</comment>

<comment>Step it up?  I have literally given it exactly the appropriate level of effort.   Therefore, no citations will be given and only circular, repetitive and literal responses will be forthcoming.</comment>

<comment>Yes, as the trolling you put out is weak.Sorry to tell you that, but you really need to do better as a troll. This is the Atlantic, higher standards and all. ;)</comment>

<comment>It is weak trolling.  It is the exact proper level, not based on the standards of the Atlantic, but on your contribution to the conversation.</comment>

<comment>Ok, got it, a self admitted troll says I make "her" posts weak and other than vague bellyaching has nothing substantive to discuss or highlight except some nebulous assertions which essentially boils down to nothing more than "I don't like you."Perhaps I was too generous with my "bot" speculation. ;)</comment>

<comment>Well, clearly if I had been direct, you would have just made an argument.  In this case it was a much more direct approach than directly making the point.</comment>

<comment>Cause this several days interaction was done by you to avoid an argument?Clearly that is working out. ;)And let be clear, you don't have an argument to make. Not really other than a repeated rephrasing  of "I don't like you."Which is cool. </comment>

<comment>The argument is there, but because there are no citations and you can only interpret things literally it appears as if all I am saying is "I don't like you."  In reality, I quite like you.   By having you miss the point, however, I have made it.</comment>

<comment>No, that is "literally" ;)  all you are doing.Typing "I don't like you" in various forms.Which is cool. I would not wish to be a member of any club that would have me for a member.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think the founders made this a feature of the Constitution?  Or do you think it is more likely they didn't think they needed to spoon feed the very basics of good governance to a group of elected officials?</comment>

<comment>I think the Founders deliberately set up a government where gridlock is a feature not a bug.</comment>

<comment>Given that parties were not a significant part of American politics at that time, and that Washington specifically warned against them, I don't think the Constitution was intentionally designed to deal with party gridlock.</comment>

<comment>I do, I think it was set up that way to keep the government from getting to powerful.And gridlock was part of it. I also think a case can be made that it was set up to encourage persuasion and compromise. And lesson President Obama did not learn and now its coming back to bite him.</comment>

<comment>So sad that you think it is because of Obama.  The GOP decided before he was even inaugurated that they were going to oppose him at every turn.  It had absolutely nothing to do with his actions.</comment>

<comment>So "sad" you don't see your own guys behaving the same way as you bellyache about the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Democrats definitely have obstructed in the past.  But if you don't see the stark differences I don't know what to tell you aside from the fact that you are blinded.In the last 5 years the GOP has filibustered more than ALL PREVIOUS CONGRESSES IN THE HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY.But yes...that is the Democrats fault.In the last 5 years the GOP has held up nominees at 3 times the average historical rate.But yes...that is the Democrats fault.It must be hard keeping your narrative going.</comment>

<comment>Sorry buddy, but if you can't see a pox on BOTH their house here on being obstructive then I don't know what to say.It is the Democrats fault...they ran an "I have the votes" admin and devil take the hindmost regardless.Now they have to deal with the consequences.</comment>

<comment>I do see a pox on both parties.  Just one party is acting MUCH MUCH worse right now, and it isn't close.  And the numbers and actions point this out.There has always been partisanship.  The current Congress is the most partisan in the history of the country and is obstructing in unprecedented historical ways.</comment>

<comment>Which is my point, OF COURSE YOU SEE IT THAT WAY.About half the public does not.I disagree profoundly that in that its it all "unprecedented" fashion. That is what the Left always says when people treat them as they treated people.Its why the voted out the Dems in the Senate in the first place.</comment>

<comment>"Which is my point, OF COURSE YOU SEE IT THAT WAY."The numbers don't lie my ideological friend."About half the public does not."Nonsense, Congress has a 10% approval rating.  Most people do NOT think Congress is doing their job."I disagree profoundly that in that its it all "unprecedented" fashion. "Your agreement isn't needed.  Unprecedented only requires not ever happening before.  Which is exactly what is going on right now.  Unprecedented numbers of filibusters.  Unprecedented few Bills being passed.  Unprecedented not even allowing a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee.  This is all unprecedented."That is what the Left always says when people treat them as they treated people."Once again, these things never happened under the left.  The Dems did Filibuster, but no where near these numbers.  The Dems did Filibuster nominees, but always gave hearings."Its why the voted out the Dems in the Senate in the first place."Do we really need to get into the differences between Mid-Term elections and Presidential elections and how turn out effects things.I think I am done.  You are so stuck in your worldview it is embarrassing.</comment>

<comment>What  numbers? And "numbers" "lie" all the time.Its not a question of how the public views congress its a question of of about 1/2 the nation (essentially) is GOP and they are really upset with how the DNC does things.Except its not "unprecidetned" its a word game. Its like saying the President has used Executive Orders less than others---when the complaint is where and on what issue not the raw count of how often they are used.Of course it happens under the Left Obama himself fillisbustered a canadate that was according to him, perfectly qualified.You guys Borked Judge Bork, and created verb BTW. You guys put a black Justice nominee thu a "high tech lynching."And you are "stuck" in the same worldview, the difference is that I don't think the GOP can do no wrong as you clearly view the DNC.</comment>

<comment>Yet no where am I defending the Democrats, yet you are here defending the GOP.Bork was Borked for a very good reason.  The Saturday Night Massacre.  Unconstitutional.  It was enough to disqualify him.  And of course, Bork actually got a hearing and vote.  Once rejected, the following nominee (Kennedy) was confirmed unanimously in an election year.Thomas has proven to be a horrendous judge.  But despite that was confirmed anyway.You need to take a logic class, specifically on logical fallacies and false equivalencies.</comment>

<comment>Republicans are being attacked all over threads on these issue/st, That you are seemingly unaware of it is kinda my point.My own comment was where was the author when Obama himself advocated a wholly political filibuster for a candidate even he said was perfectly qualified?Nowhere to be found, which I presume includes you. The Left never has an issue with such stuff until the shoe is on their foot. ;)Nope, Thomas is a good judge and Bork would have been a great one.Actually you need to do so, your assertions are not facts. Your opinion does not a fallacious reasoning make.</comment>

<comment>There's no timetable set out in Article 2 where Congress sets the dates for the Electoral College, but they presumably can't prevent a president from being elected just by refusing to produce a schedule.</comment>

<comment>Which they are not doing.They are just refusing to operate on a timetable convenient to the Executive branch.</comment>

<comment>When your interpretation of the law makes no sense (for example, that the Constitution lays out how this process should happen but that there is no intent that this process should actually be followed during a relevant time period) it does not trump the standard interpretation of the law.</comment>

<comment>How do you define "standard interpretation?"As in "original intent?And it makes perfect sense. The Senate is a co-equal branch of government that can take whatever time it likes in "advice and consent."Its not the Executive branches job to define what is a "relevant time period" for a co-equal branch.Nor yours or mine for that matter.</comment>

<comment>"And he is perfectly within his rights as the leader of a co-equal branch of government to say when and where such a vote takes place."When and where?  Absolutely.  Saying "never" is against the Constitution.Unfortunately, there is no provision in the Constitution punishing Senators for not following the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>They didn't say never, just not right now.</comment>

<comment>They said they weren't going to hold hearings...period.  You are being purposefully obtuse</comment>

<comment>Right now. Not they would never hold hearings ever again.</comment>

<comment>This Congress ends at the beginning of January.  If they don't hold hearings by then, that means they have failed to do their job as stated in the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Cite for me the specific passage that requires them to give a hearing by "January"Please.</comment>

<comment>The New Congress begins on January 3rd as stated by the Constitution.  Which means, if not acted on before, the PREVIOUS Congress refused to do their job as highlighted in the Constitution.You are being purposefully obtuse and you know it.</comment>

<comment>Nope, I'm approaching it as per what the specifics of the Constitution actually say.Not what I want then to say.</comment>

<comment>My wife wants me to mow the lawn. I tell her I won't. Not that I never will, I just say that no, I won't mow the lawn. I wait. I die. Is it possible for me to mow the lawn once I'm dead? Can a Senate which has ceased to exist act upon anything? If I don't do something before I die, I will never do it. It will remain forever undone, for all of eternity, at least as it relates to me. Maybe my wife's future husband can do it, but that doesn't give me credit for having done it. If I don't do it, it was never done. It becomes irrelevant whether I told her I would never do it, or just said I wouldn't do it (which implies I'll never do it anyway), or even set a timeline and failed to do it before I died.I may not have an explicit deadline, but I have a practical one. Just like the Senate does. If this Senate doesn't hold a hearing and vote, then this Senate will not have fulfilled its duties. Perhaps the next Senate goes ahead and does those things, but that doesn't change the fact that this Senate is "dead" and didn't do it. Once the Senate ends, it can never go back and accomplish something.</comment>

<comment>Obama said that he was against gay marriage because his faith tradition taught that marriage was between a man an women.He "evolved."Things change and politicos say all kind of things that actually turn out much differently.Until there is an actual nominee its all just theory and hysterics.Unless of course the Constitution does not actually say that failing to hold hearings is "not fulfilling its duties."And as the Constitution is silent on when a co-equal branch of government must "advice and consent" within X period. That is really not the case.</comment>

<comment>You didn't address my point. If it's required, there must be a deadline, otherwise there's no way to enforce the requirement.If it's required, there is a deadline. If there is no deadline, then it is not required. That is inescapable.</comment>

<comment>As mentioned prior as far as I'm aware there is literally no such Constitutional "deadline" or "requirement."It does not exist.The "requirement" is ONLY "advice and consent" not how long they, the Senate, can take to do so.In context the Senate term does not end until what 2017?  Perhaps that is the only deadline that matters? Or perhaps, in the absence of a Constitutional requirement for a specific timeframe, maybe the next one can take it up.I am "required" to go to work....but I don't have to do it NOW.You can think if it as a check and balance if you like.</comment>

<comment>There is no explicit deadline. There is an implied, practical deadline, at the least (the end of the session of Congress).Once again, try to keep up: if there's a requirement, there must be some way to determine whether the require has or has not been met. It's easy enough to determine that the requirement has been met: in this case, the Senate will have given its advice and consent (or rejected the nominee). However, there must also be some way to determine if the requirement failed to be met. That is, as I've explained, the practical deadline of the end of the Congress's session. If we reach the end of the session, and the Senate has not acted, then it has not upheld its duty.I'm not saying there's any earlier deadline than the end of this session, in early January. I would prefer that they do it earlier, but, you're right, and there's no requirement that it be done earlier. But it must be done by then, at the absolute latest.You may be required to go to work, and even not be required to go now. But, you do have to go at some point. If your boss asked whether you were coming in, and you said no (but didn't say you're never coming in again), at some point, he would be right to say that you never came in, and that you're fired. At that point, the question of whether you came in would be unambiguously resolved. Either you came in, or you didn't. If you keep saying you might come in later, maybe tomorrow, or next week, and your boss never gave you a date certain by which you must come in, he could still fire you. Why? Because you would have failed to meet your duty of going in to work, despite there not being any explicit deadline by which you were required to act.And, if the Senate is allowed to postpone indefinitely, then what is the check on the Senate's power? Are you arguing that there's a check on the Executive, that the appointee must be confirmed, but there's no check on the Senate for failing to confirm/reject? That's not how the Constitution was designed. Checks and balances go both ways. If the Senate can indefinitely delay, then there is no check on the Senate's power. It's power would be unchecked.</comment>

<comment>Not in the Constitution.  And even by your POV that gives MM until something like late 2017.And as mentioned as there is currently NO nominee, this is all hysteria and theory.And also as such we don't really know if MM means it or is simply, in the words of one poster "grandstanding." As mentioned politicos say all kinds of things they don't actually do.And, and, and what is the practical difference between what MM says and Obama saying he is going to veto legislation he has not even read?I am "required" to go to work today. But I don't have to go NOW.What is the "check" on any branches power?If the Senate refused to EVER hold hearings then presumably they would be voted out of office---presuming of course that is what the people wanted.The Constitution was designed, in part, to prevent any one branch from becoming to powerful.A case can be made for gridlock being a functional part of that.</comment>

<comment>I think you got him...he stumbled onto something else...let's see where the saga takes us (by the way, your example was spot on and love your deductive reasoning by the way)</comment>

<comment>By that logic, the President does not have to nominate anyone. Inaction by either the President OR the Senate is CLEARLY unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>Quite probably.And no, it would NOT be "unconstitutional" "clearly" or otherwise.Please cite for the specific passage in which is details it as being such.</comment>

<comment>Article 2, Sec. 2. It says that the President "...shall, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate appoint...." This shall (like the previous one about the President making a nomination) does not refer to a discretionary power of the President, but a duty. It his duty as well as his prerogative, to make appointments of critical officers in the government. The Senate's duty to ACT on his nominations is derivative of the President's duty to appoint. The Senate must ACT - i.e., must vote up or down. If they delay consent, they are not merely rejecting a given nominee; they are nullifying the PROCESS of appointment, nullifying the President's enumerated appointment power - and yes, Virginia, that is CLEARLY unconstitutional.</comment>

<comment>Nope, there is no Constitutional requirement to hold "advice and consent" on the Executive branches schedule.Show me the exact passage where the Executive branch gets to dictate a timetable for the Senate to hold hearings.</comment>

<comment>It's not about 'dictating' a timetable. But the text clearly entails that there must BE a process of appointment; the President MUST propose, the Senate MUST dispose. If that were not the case, the President could pull the maneuver McConnell is pulling, and delay a nomination on the hope that he'd get a better Senate after midterm elections. That'd be unconstitutional, and so is the stunt McConnell is pulling, now. The very LOGIC of the appointment-power (which is both the prerogative AND obligation of the President) requires, as its sufficient condition, positive action on the nomination by the Senate.</comment>

<comment>Except for there being NO mention of any timetable/schedule for that to happen. The Senate can hold hearings on nominees anytime it wishes or not.Does not say when they "MUST dispose."Besides until the President actually nominates someone its all theoretic.And its still does not mean the Senate is required to take "positive action" for the convenience of the Executive branch.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, you don't get to play "the Constitution doesn't explicitly prohibit what I am doing, therefore it is legal" card. The text says, [the President] "shall nominate, and by and with the advice and counsel of the Senate, shall appoint..."  The "shall" here indicates the following: It is the President's power to appoint. The Senate does not appoint, but only plays a necessary facilitating role; the Senate can accept the nominee, or they can reject the nominee - and in the latter case the power/duty of the President to nominate, gets relegated back to him. This is the PROCESS of making appointments. But this process of the President's appointment power is DENIED, if either the President or the Senate can unilaterally refuse to act. Strict contradiction of the logical content of the text, is a violation of the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Sorry but its NOT "the Constitution doesn't specifically prohibit"The Constitution is completely  SILENT as to timeframe. its dos not say they Senate "must advice and consent within X amount of time" its just says "advice and consent."A co equal branch of government is not required to operate in the schedule most convenient for the Executive.And again, as the President has yet to nominate anyone at all the whole discussion is theoretic.Not using the Presidents schedule is not  "denying" anything.</comment>

<comment>The discussion is not theoretic, because the President does not have the option of indefinite delay in nominating someone. Further, the terms "advice" and consent" are not verbal nouns connoting acts of omission: the text does NOT say that the Senate can "abstain," "delay," "defer," or "withhold" its consent. Instead, the prerogative of "advice and consent" is pursuant to the goal of fulfilling appointments. It is logically incoherent to suggest otherwise; to argue for that, you would have to find language which explicitly allows for it. But there is only the President's prerogative and duty to appoint, which the Senate cannot obstruct. The Republicans are violating their oaths of office for pure partisan advantage, and if they keep it up they are going to get wiped out in November. THEN we'll see how much you like it, when the Democrats can hand-pick the next Justice.</comment>

<comment>Is there an nominee?Nope, then its theoretic.People can say anything they wish but until there is nominee its all words.But there is no language whatsoever about when they must provide "advice and consent."There is literally NO "oath of office " they are in violation of.They may well be wiped out, nobody shoots themselves in the foot like the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Either they're required to do it, or they aren't. If they're required to do something, then there must be some deadline by which they're required to act. Otherwise, than can just delay indefinitely, which is equivalent to not being required to ever act in the first place.If this Senate can punt to the next one, what's to stop the next Senate from punting to the following one, too? And the one after that, ad infinitum?</comment>

<comment>Nobody is questing the Senate needs to "advice and consent" I'm just saying there is absolutely no Constitutional requirement that "advice and consent" MUST be done within "X" timeframe.There is literally no actual deadline I am aware of."ad infinitum"What does the Constitution say?My guess is that its one of the things the Founders put in or left out to encourage some degree of cooperation. Good will is needed to get things done so its a good idea to not run roughshed over the other guy all the time. You might need their help later.Also it could be simply designed to create more gridlock to prevent one group from gaining too much power.BTW I'm watching the President on TV say that it would be wrong to hold up a qualified applicant for political reasons.......when that is precisely what he personally did when he in the Senate. </comment>

<comment>No, it is a bug.  Political parties are the vector of the bug.  Without political parties, the constitution might work as intended where individual representatives and senators vote their conscience and/or the will of their constituencies.  As it is, they kind of have to vote the party line, conscience and constituency be d@mned.</comment>

<comment>I think its a feature.Without it one party would dominate and be able to anything it liked.You can substitute "group" for "party" if you like. Or click etc.You will always have special interests and people looking to gain all the power for themselves.Gridlock for all its problems is a break/check on that.</comment>

<comment>Not that I am much of an originalist, because I really don't want my behavior or government dictated by long dead people, but the constitution is not really set up for immutable parties.  The intent was that people would flow from group to group based on their own self interest.  The party has become the interest now, not good governance.  That was never intended, even though they developed pretty much before the ink was dry.</comment>

<comment>Point being when you start looking at the interpretation of the Constitution it becomes rather murky really fast."Penumbra's" and all.Which is why whatever slows down or makes it really hard for one party to dominate everything is a largely a good thing.</comment>

<comment>When McConnell asserted that, under no circumstance, would the Senate perform this duty, he asserted his intent to disregard the Constitution.You seem to miss that. This is not about McConnell holding a hearing whenever he feels like it. This is about McConnell directly stating his intent to not perform his Constitutional duties, ever, under any circumstances.</comment>

<comment>Nope. As I have been quite patiently explaining---on day 2 now.The Constitution simply requires "advice and consent" NOT that it must be done on a specific timeframe, much less on one convenient to the Executive branch.The context is kinda crucial. And in context MM simply asserted he was not going to do it now."directly stating his intent not to perform his Constitutional duties, EVER, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."(emp mine.)Did he actually say that?Citation please. ;)</comment>

<comment>Except they (Fox News) probably won't. They'll just rail against how the people haven't had enough time to decide, and that the vacancy should remain vacant until after the next election, and continue with that until they hold the White House, at which point it will suddenly be time to nominate a replacement. Right after the election, it'll be "too soon." Then, there will be no "just right" time, because we'll skip that and go directly to "too late, because it's too close to the 2020 election."It's basically the same thing they and the NRA say about guns: right after a shooting, it's too soon, and we shouldn't be politicizing it. Once enough time passes, they're like, why are we bringing up old things? It's been (however long) since the last shooting, so we don't need to worry about it anymore. Then the next shooting happens, and the cycle begins anew. Never mind that it's not "too soon" to bring up legislation making gun purchasing, ownership, and carrying easier.And so it will be with judicial nominees. It'll perpetually be "too soon" or "too late" while a Dem has the White House, and will only magically be the "just right" time once the GOP has it.</comment>

<comment>ACA isn't even remotely comparable.  It passed BOTH Houses of Congress, and the first vote was over 60 Senators.</comment>

<comment>On a wholly partisan level.The even held up the swearing in a elected GOP guy to be able to do it.</comment>

<comment>"On a wholly partisan level. "Irrelevant.  It was passed per the requirements of the Constitution."The even held up the swearing in a elected GOP guy to be able to do it."Uh, no they didn't.  You are now just making things up.</comment>

<comment>Nope, they jammed it down everyone's throat on a wholly partisan level.Now you Lefties don't like been treated as you treated others.And nope, they did just that.</comment>

<comment>Yup, a 10 month process of negotiations is "jamming down everyone's throats."Once again, not even remotely comparable.  And you are so blinded by your partisan hate you can't even think logically."Now you Lefties don't like been treated as you treated others."The Lefties followed the course of the Constitution.  A law requires majorities of both houses of Congress, and that is what the ACA got.You pick and choose when you want to follow the Constitution and that is obvious.</comment>

<comment>Yep, the VOTE was wholly partisan. Passed in a "I have the votes" fashion.Not saying it was not legal, Saying that doing business that way is how we ended up here.And now you have to lay in the bed you made.</comment>

<comment>So on one side, following the Constitution by the letter.  On the other side ignoring it and blaming the other for following the Constitutional process.Yea, sounds like a bunch of sore losers to me that can't handle the fact that they weren't in control for a couple of years.</comment>

<comment>They are, there is NO such requirement that forces a co-equal branch of government to "advice and consent" on a schduele convenient to the Executive branch.</comment>

<comment>They are required to do it.  Congress convenes BEFORE the Presidency is over.  Which means if they wait until after the President is out of office, THIS Congress is refusing to do their job.</comment>

<comment>Cite for me the specific passage that says that,. Please.</comment>

<comment>Being purposefully obtuse as usual.20th Amendment.Section 1"The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3rd day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin."The rest is all logic.  If they haven't done their job by this time it is now a NEW Congress.  Which means the PREVIOUS Congress didn't do their job.</comment>

<comment>In other words that passage DOES NOT say the Senate is required to hold hearings on any specific timeframe.</comment>

<comment>Your lack of logic won't make this any less embarrassing for you.The 114th Congress is refusing to do their job.  If they don't do it until the 114th Congress term ends, then regardless of time table they will have not fulfilled their duty as written in the Constitution.Regardless of whether the 115th acts on it or not doesn't mean the 114th will have fulfilled their duty.  They will have not.</comment>

<comment>Nope, they are nor required to do their job as per the timetable of the Executive branch.There is no such Constitutional requirement.Even by your count they have till 2017.</comment>

<comment>They have stated that they will not.  I fully expect them to keep to their word and not meet their Constitutional requirement.It is quite obvious at this point, unless they walk back their comments quite a bit, that the 114th Congress will not be Advising or Consenting and therefore not meeting the requirements stated in the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Will not now, they did not say ever.And how is what they ":saying" any different than the President saying he is going to veto something before he even sees' it?More to the point as the President has yet to nominate anyone this hysteria of you folks on the Left is really rather premature.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  January 2nd, 2017.The fun thing is, with this nonsense and the electoral map as it is, Obama will probably have a Dem 115th senate to approve his nominee between 1/3 and 1/20...  and then we may have President Trump.</comment>

<comment>Certainly possible.</comment>

<comment>Certainly possible. The GOP has a tendency for circular firing squads and dropping the ball. They could lose the gains they made in the last election cycle.</comment>

<comment>This is why we can't have nice things.</comment>

<comment>Because of the Constitution?</comment>

<comment>You're really struggling with the English language.   Not all communication is literal.</comment>

<comment>Really?But.....but....you are the "person" asking for a source cite on someone literally "jamming" legislation down peoples throats and spinning MM statement as absolutely literal.I thought "literal" was your thing. ;)If you are going to troll you need to step it up. This is the Atlantic, standards people, standards. ;)</comment>

<comment>Literal is my thing when *I* say it's my thing.  It is not my thing because you say it's my thing.</comment>

<comment>Which is another way saying you are  a Leftist.No "standards" but what you want, when you want them. In other words no "standards" at. at least not how that word is normally used. ;)</comment>

<comment>No.  It doesn't mean leftist.   Leftist has a different meaning.   There is a word for it, but it's not leftist.</comment>

<comment>No, in context its a pretty good description of Leftist behavior. As people are pretty much what they do, its a pretty good functional definition of Leftist.</comment>

<comment>What someone does isn't what defines them.  Show me a citation where leftist is defined as this.You are very confused.</comment>

<comment>No, it kinda does, trolls, troll. its what they do, its who they are.Oh, that in other places and other situations that might not be "all" they are. But its certainly a part of them.Similarly Leftist have no standards, as you already demonstrated. So yes, its part of who they are, what they are.Its just easy to see in stuff in interactions like this. </comment>

<comment>If you just get to make up the meaning of words, of course it is going to unarguably be true and you will be exactly correct.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.....its less "making words up" than simply accurately describing demonstrable actions.</comment>

<comment>Well, apparently do you not only make up words but the whole story.  Good for you.</comment>

<comment>As mentioned really not "making up words" when you accurately describe someone's behavior.And I get what I give.I would prefer an actual, polite, substantive discussion, but you want to get all troll, its that is ok by by me....until I get bored.</comment>

<comment>It's okay.   We all struggle sometimes.</comment>

<comment>Where does it say "they jammed it down *everyone's* throat."They may have jammed it, but it's not clear it was down the throat and it certainly doesn't say it was down all the throats.Show me where it says it was down the throats.</comment>

<comment>Are you confusing a figure of speech for literally taking a piece of legislation, rolling it up into a cylinder and then literally trying to force it down someone's throat?Cause that is so not what it is.</comment>

<comment>Are you sure?  Can you show me a citation for that?</comment>

<comment>You need a citation that "jamming" something down someone's throat isn't literal?Hmmmm.........sounds like a question a bot of some sort would ask.Sorry, but unless you can prove you are a actual human being I don't have time for this. I don't answer questions from software programs.If you are going to troll, please step it up. This is the Atlantic after all, standards people, standards. ;)</comment>

<comment>Ahh, but you do answer questions from software programs.</comment>

<comment>Only when I want. ;)Kinda curious about the just how far into the Turing test  thing I need to get.But don't worry, when I get bored I'll stop giving you attention. Or is that what does worry you?</comment>

<comment>You say that Congress isn't obligated to act on the President's timetable. But shouldn't they be obligated to act on the people's behalf? By confirming or denying a nomination by Obama? If Obama nominates someone and they deny it, fine that's their job. But if they don't have a hearing, isn't that dereliction of duty? And it's been stated they wouldn't even consider Obama's nomination. They've stated they want the People's voice to factor into the selection of the next Justice. Doesn't that mean they'll consider the next President's nominee, not Obama's? Doesn't that still mean congress didn't do their job?</comment>

<comment>Well as they were appointed by the people who wanted the Democrats in the Senate replaced perhaps they are.In any case they still are a co-equal branch of the government and can operate on their own schedule.No, it does not mean that at all.</comment>

<comment>How is it that if they won't consider Obama's nominee not dereliction of duty? From the article:"Declared they would not allow a hearing or vote on President Obama’s nominee to replace Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court."The Constitution says Congress has to allow at least a hearing correct? If Congress does not allow that, isn't that dereliction of duty? Your argument of timetables is irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>The statement does not say they will NEVER hold a hearing the context is right now. Current Senate runs until 2017 in and of itself.The Constitution literally does not require the Senate to hold a hearing within "X" time period. Just that it must "advice and consent"They can, as per the Constitution take its own sweet time about doing it.Utterly silent as to if a President can make a co-equal branch of government do their work on what is convenient for him.And in any case, there is NO nominee, until there is, this whole discussion is just theory and hysterics.</comment>

<comment>You are correct. There is no nominee at this time. But you're argument about the President forcing Congress to work on his schedule is irrelevant because they've already stated they won't entertain any nominee he presents. So if he nominates someone and they do nothing, about that nominee, as they said they would, that would be dereliction of duty.</comment>

<comment>Which they have every right to do.The Constitutional requirement is "advice and consent" NOT a timeframe for WHEN they must do so.Nothing that says they can't wait until 2017 a week before they leave office.Actually nothing that says the 114th MUST do so. Maybe the 115 will.Besides,  politicos say all kinds of things to only change their minds later.Remember when President Obama said you could keep your doctor. Period? Or when he was against gay marriage?</comment>

<comment>They said they won't consider Obama's nominee. Full stop. They didn't say they'll consider his nominee later, they said they won't. The problem isn't when, it's if. And they've already said they won't.</comment>

<comment>But they didn't say they would NEVER do so either.The context is current nominees. Not all nominees from now until the end of time.And how is that really any different than Obama saying he is going to veto legislation prior to even reading it?Like I said prior. Obama said people could keep their doctor "period or  "full stop."</comment>

<comment>Can everyone please stop w/ the throat metaphor? Patently overused.</comment>

<comment>But accurate. But sure, how about "forced?"</comment>

<comment>Forced, jammed, rammed.... don't care about the verb. A liberal did it above, too. It's just tired.</comment>

<comment>"inflicted?"</comment>

<comment>Here is the difference.  No one is saying they can't filibuster.  They are refusing to even entertain the process.  They are just saying "no, we will no longer do our job as described in the Constitution and we don't believe the President has the right either."</comment>

<comment>Right now.The Senate is not required---unless of course you can present it. ;)---to "advice and consent" on a schedule convenient to the Executive branch.The Constitution does not require they work on the Presidents timetable.</comment>

<comment>There is no schedule.  McConnell said they would not be advising or consenting on ANY nominee.This has nothing to do with a timetable.  McConnell has refused to do it AT ALL.</comment>

<comment>I'm done making this distinction with cxt, who is really stuck on this thing with the Presiden't timetable.</comment>

<comment>He has to grasp and claw to keep his narrative alive.  After all, supposedly his party loves the Constitution.  Never has it been more obvious than now that is an absolute lie.</comment>

<comment>Sorry if I already answered this, lot going on.McConnell didn't say EVER AGAIN. Just not right now.And the Senate, a co-equal branch of government is not required to perform its function on a schedule convenient to the Executive branch.</comment>

<comment>"McConnell didn't say EVER AGAIN. Just not right now."He said not during THIS Presidency.  Which mean not during this Congress.  Which means THIS Congress isn't doing their job.This is VERY simple, and the fact you can't seem to grasp it and keep repeating the same false talking point over and over again doesn't make you look any better."And the Senate, a co-equal branch of government is not required to perform its function on a schedule convenient to the Executive branch."You realize that Congress has set terms right?  And if they refuse to do it at all during this term they are refusing to do their job as outlined by the Constitution.Ugh, I am done arguing with stupid.</comment>

<comment>Let me respond in kind.Thank you, cxt, for finally admitting that the Republicans are violating the Constitution. Your admission three posts up is very gracious, and your confession that you only argued as long as you did because your medication was at the wrong dose is very humanizing.I appreciate the several different places where you confessed your dishonesty and asked for forgiveness, and I am sure that, despite what you told us about that cucumber, everyone will be quite understanding.</comment>

<comment>Except I didn't "admit" anything of the sort.Jeez, do you Lefties all go to the same charm school or something? ;)Like nobody has ever used that particular kind of post before.I argued as long as I did because people kept repeating the narrative, which was inaccurate.BTW the post you made is really rather pedestrian as far as snark goes. This is the Atlantic after all. I'm sure you can do better. ;)</comment>

<comment>It's really not wise to throw stones when you live in a glass house. Biden From ’92: President Should 'Not Name A Nominee Until After The November Election'   https://youtu.be/oVvxGa0zhWo</comment>

<comment>Did Republicans go along with this idea at the time?</comment>

<comment>Why do I never get an answer to this?</comment>

<comment>Maybe it's because people shy away from people that talk to themselves.</comment>

<comment>Haha, maybe.  I think it's more like they get hyped up about the spoon-fed message without thinking it through.</comment>

<comment>So any statement from Biden on the Senate floor is now the rule the Nation must follow?  I'm thinking Obama would be happy to live with that precedent, you know?</comment>

<comment>10 minutes after that clip, Biden said:  “Therefore I stand by my position, Mr. President, if the President [George H.W. Bush] consults and cooperates with the Senate or moderates his selections absent consultation, then his nominees may enjoy my support as did Justices Kennedy and Souter.”So clearly he was not advocating a 100% hardline against all nominees, unlike today's Republicans.</comment>

<comment>But Obama did.He personally advocated a filibuster of a candidate that he himself said was perfectly qualified. And he did so for wholly partisan reasons.Now his chickens are coming home to roost---so to speak.</comment>

<comment>Not the same. </comment>

<comment>Exactly the same? No.But for all practical purpose yes, they are comparable,.</comment>

<comment>Not even remotely comparable.In one scenario, we have an actual filibuster.  Going through the nomination process, a hearing, and a man actually getting confirmed to the Supreme Court.In the other scenario, no hearing, no nomination process, refusing to even talk to the President, and refusing to even go through the process.If you can't see the SUBSTANTIAL difference between the two, it says something about you.</comment>

<comment>The only real difference is one failed and one did not.Again, please present for me the exact Constitutional requirement that forces a co-equal branch of government to preform its function on the timetable of the Executive branch.</comment>

<comment>False, I listed all the differences.  One had a hearing, one doesn't.  One talked to the President, one is refusing.  One went through the process as outlined by the Constitution, one is refusing."Again, please present for me the exact Constitutional requirement that forces a co-equal branch of government to preform its function on the timetable of the Executive branch."You keep saying this.  There IS NO TIMETABLE.  They are refusing to do it AT ALL.By your logic.  If the GOP wins the Presidency and the Dems win the Senate, you would be ok with the Democrats not even entertaining the GOP  Presidents nominee for all 4 years.  After all, there is no timetable right?  They can just wait and wait and wait and refuse to do their job.I swear to god, you are either being purposefully obtuse or you don't think things through at all.</comment>

<comment>I think the Founders presumed that the Senate would act like responsible grown-ups, and not petulant children.</comment>

<comment>This has already been explained to you. </comment>

<comment>Not effectively.</comment>

<comment>Because you're either dishonest or illiterate. Take your pick. </comment>

<comment>Well its not "illiterate" as I keep asking for somebody to present the exact passage that gives the Executive branch the right to dictate the Senate hold hearing at the Executive convenience.And nobody has done so.and its not "dishonest" because as far I'm aware Obama has not actually nominated  anyone yet.......so the whole conversation is theoretical. ;)Perhaps less time spent in snark and more time spent on actually reading up on the topic might be a good way to spend your time. ;)</comment>

<comment>"Perhaps less time spent in snark and more time spent on actually reading up on the topic might be a good way to spend your time. ;)"The irony is truly hilarious.</comment>

<comment>Right back at you pal. ;)You have as much glass in your "house: as I do. I just don't deny it as you do.</comment>

<comment>Article II, Section 3. You're illiterate. </comment>

<comment>Fan it out mouth. ;)Show it to me.Show me the explicit passage where it says that "advice and consent" MUST be done within X time period.</comment>

<comment>Article II, Section 3. </comment>

<comment>Fan it out, show it to me, quote the passage.If it said that you would already have posted it.But you and I both know it does not.Well I do. I actually read it. ;)Don't; really know about you., </comment>

<comment>Then the GOP should filibuster and have to do it publicly just like Obama.  Instead they are refusing to even have a hearing.And let's note, the man that Obama filibustered is now on the Supreme Court.  Not remotely comparable.</comment>

<comment>And they not required to hold said "hearings" on the timetable convenient to the Executive.And Obama's failing to block him in no fashion undercuts that he TRIED.He just could not get it done.</comment>

<comment>They ARE required to Advise and Consent.  Right now they are refusing to do it AT ALL.  There is no "maybe later" or timetable going on.  They are just saying "no"And your grasping is getting more and more obvious."And Obama's failing to block him in no fashion undercuts that he TRIED."Do you not understand the difference between going through the process and filibustering?  And refusing to go through the process at all?Are you really that partisan that you can't see the difference?</comment>

<comment>On the Presidents timetable. They never said they wouldn't do it ever.I just see a wholly political and failed attempt to block a perfectly qualified nominee and a so far successful one. ;)</comment>

<comment>"They never said they wouldn't do it ever."YES, yes they did.  They said they will not hear ANY nominee from the President.  THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY SAID.By the time the next President is around, this Congress will no longer be in session.  So they are refusing to do it AT ALL.You are acting like someone who doesn't understand basic logic.</comment>

<comment>Right now. Not they would not give a hearing EVER AGAIN.</comment>

<comment>This Congress ends at the beginning of January of 2017.  If they haven't held a hearing by then, then they haven't done their job as stated in the Constitution.  Simple as that.</comment>

<comment>Please cite for me the specific passage in the Constitution that says that.Is there a specific date like "2017" in there?</comment>

<comment>20th Amendment, Section 1"The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of Senators and Representatives at noon on the 3rd day of January, of the years in which such terms would have ended if this article had not been ratified; and the terms of their successors shall then begin."Congressional Term ends on the 3rd.  Which means what if they haven't performed their function at that date?</comment>

<comment>I don't know what does the Constitution say about it?Oh...that's rights, it does NOT state they are required to have a hearing by X date.</comment>

<comment>OK, confirmed, you don't use logic.</comment>

<comment>And you seemingly can't read. ;)The Constitution simply does not allow the President to set timetables for  a co-equal branch of the  government that are convenient for him.</comment>

<comment>You keep saying Timetable, the President hasn't set a time table.  He has expressed that he wants the 114th Congress to do their job.  They are refusing to do their job.  Will the 115th Congress do it?  Maybe, but irrelevant.  It still means the 114th Congress will have not done their duty as outlined by the Constitution by Advising or Consenting.</comment>

<comment>And they will, when they are ready to do so.And not one second sooner.Please list for me the specific Constitutional passage where they have to "do their job" on the Executive branches schedule.</comment>

<comment>"And they will, when they are ready to do so."Based on what?  McConnell has said they will not.  The fact remains that the Constitution says the Senate SHALL Advise and Consent.  If the 114 Congress ends without the Senate doing that, then they will have not met that requirement."Please list for me the specific Constitutional passage where they have to "do their job" on the Executive branches schedule."You keep saying this...when did Obama set a schedule?  Answer:  He didn't.</comment>

<comment>Based on him not saying EVER. He asking them to do it now. They are refusing--as if their right.Again, there is no requirement in the Constitution that the 114 have a hearing prior to 2017 or even after, The passage says they will do so, not WHEN they must do it.</comment>

<comment>"Based on him not saying EVER. "He said the 114th Congress wouldn't vote on it.  That means that the 114th will not be meeting its Constitutional requirement.  115th is irrelevant.Is there something you are missing here?"Again, there is no requirement in the Constitution that the 114 have a hearing prior to 2017 or even after"No, the Constitution just says they have to do something and the 114th is choosing not to do it."The passage says they will do so, not WHEN they must do it."It says they SHALL.  If they don't.   Then they haven't met that requirement.  Once the 115th is sworn in, if the 114th hasn't met that duty then they never will and therefore not meeting their requirements.You can say time table all you want, but that doesn't mean that the Congress can just ignore nominees to perpetuity.</comment>

<comment>But using your logic, what precisely is to prevent them from doing exactly that?  If we're going solely by the notion that the Constitution doesn't actually require them to act at any specific point, could they, for example, not nominate anyone during Clinton's term in office if she wins?  Do they ever actually have to vote?  Or could they let the numbers in the Supreme Court actually drop below quorum, and thus in practical terms eliminate it?</comment>

<comment>Who knows.Presumably the check and balance of elections would kick in. But that is exactly how the Senate went GOP.And its not "my logic" unless you wish to present it, there is nothing in the Consitution that forces a co-equal branch of government to operate on  timetable convenient to the Executive branch.</comment>

<comment>It's not about "convenience", it's about good governance.</comment>

<comment>As you, the President and the Left defines it.Not as the rest of see it.</comment>

<comment>The majority of the country feels it is the right of the President to nominate someone to the Supreme Court.  The majority also feels the Senate should hold hearings in a timely fashion.http://www.people-press.org/20...Essentially Republicans are still sore losers over Obama being President.</comment>

<comment>And the people in this country voted out the Democrats and replaced them with Republicans in the Senate.And a co-equal branch of the government is not required to operate in the Executive branches timetable.And fortunalty we don't run a nation on polls but on the Consitution. </comment>

<comment>No matter how many times you say it, it doesn't make it any more relevant.Do you feel the Senate is required to Advise and Consent at some point?  Or can they hold off forever, never ever voting, and essentially ending Supreme Court nominations all together?</comment>

<comment>and no matter how many times YOU repeat it makes in no more accurate or relevant either. ;)At some point? Sure. Just nothing in the Constitution that says NOW.</comment>

<comment>Never said now.  And no one is saying now.  We are saying at some point, and the GOP is saying "no, we will not at any time during THIS Congress."Completely unacceptable.</comment>

<comment>To you and the President and the DNC. But Constitutionally perfectly legal.And they will hold hearings when they wish, not on your or the Presidents convenience.</comment>

<comment>Pedantic reading of the constitution doesn't absolve congress from their responsibility to their constituents or the country. The president will have the right to make a recess appointment if the R's continue to throw a tantrum. It would be the responsible thing to just hold hearing and then vote up or down</comment>

<comment>Its plain wording, not "pedantic"---it either gives a specific timeframe as per the convenience of the Executive or not.And if the President can make such appointments then he can. But they actually have to be in "recess."</comment>

<comment>Definition of pedantic- of, relating to, or being a pedant i.e. a person who annoys other people by correcting small errors and giving too much attention to minor detailsDefinition of shalla —used to express a command or exhortation <you shall="" go="">b —used in laws, regulations, or directives to express what is mandatory <it shall="" be="" unlawful="" to="" carry="" firearms="">Appointments ClauseThe President . . . SHALL nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, SHALL appoint ... Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States</comment>

<comment>Sorry its annoying but the facts often are. ;)There is no Constitutional requirement for the Senate to use the schedule convenient for the Executive as to when they "Advice and consent."If there was a timetable/schedule would be there.</comment>

<comment>And the FACT remains that the Constitution says they SHALL Advise and Consent.So if the 114th doesn't do either, then they are not meeting that requirement.  When the 115th is sworn in, if the 114th hasn't had a vote then the matter is settled, they didn't meet their Constitutional requirement.</comment>

<comment>Excerpt it does not say WHEN they must do so.And again, as the President has nominated no one, its wholly theoretic.</comment>

<comment>And its does not say WHEN they must do so.It actually does not even say that anything about "114" or the "115."Sorry of the actual facts bother you so much.</comment>

<comment>Are paid by the comment? Do you troll for the Heritage foundation for free? A hundred different people point out the same flaws in your pedantic, hypocritical argument but you still don't budge or try to counter the new points brought up. "OH there's no timeline spelled out so that makes rank partisan obstruction a feature not a bug! argle-bargle" wait are you actually Mitch McConnell?</comment>

<comment>At least one rumor says I work for the site and I'm paid to drive up the comment count and give the illusion of some degree of balance for the ad folks.You have not heard that one?And if 100 people say a foolish thing its still a foolish thing.My argument is based on the Constitution, what is says and what it does not. I recommend you actually read it.  ;)There is no "timeline" at all.They, the Senate, can take whatever time they like in with the whole "advice and consent."Even if you and the President and the DNC don't like it.</comment>

<comment>Are you really ok with the republicans taking this tactic? Do you think it is better to avoid doing their job (even if they are allowed to get away with it) than negotiating for a moderate consensus choice? Is the country better served by an 8 member court rather than 9 even if the split decisions will favor liberals more than conservatives? Is compromising with Democrats so much worse than doing nothing?</comment>

<comment>I note the Left only complains about the "tactics' when somebody starts doing what they do.As mentioned where was the author and you for that matter you while Obama was fillbustering a candidate even he admitted was perfectly qualified?Nobody on the Left was all hacked when Obama was  telling everyone that its not a tax when it was.I could go on.Like I also said, gridlock is a feature not a bug. Its designed to prevent one group from essentially ruling unopposed.</comment>

<comment>Once again you are using false comparisons. Obama filibustered after that candidate was nominated and vetted by the senate. Republicans have refused to even meet with any nominee no matter who they are. He could nominate Lindsey Graham but they still wouldn't consider him"Nobody on the Left was all hacked when they held up Scott Brown swearing in..." because that never happened http://www.politifact.com/pund...The ACA mandate isn't a tax but the penalty for not complying is constitutional under the taxing authority granted in the constitution. Like a speeding ticket isn't a "tax" on speeding but the govt has the authority to penalize people financially-- but I'm sure you knew that being such an expert on the constitution. Gridlock doesn't serve anyone except the people who profit off of the status quo and inequality. and possibly the rare internet commenter who wants annoy liberals about non-existent hypocrisy</comment>

<comment>Nope, he , himself literally did what he himself now says on should not do. Which is deny qualified people for political reasons.Just watched him say so on TV while I typing a response.Is there a nominee? Then the GOP is only theoretically refusing to meet with them.Scott Brown says it did. We can argue about that. But its just one example. How about Reid keep all that legislation from getting to the floor to vote?Its perfectly legal but in the eyes of many dirty pool.And the ACA was a judged a tax---exactly the opposite of Obama's claims--kinda like you can keep your doctor. period. ;)And gridlock keeps any party from amassing too much power.</comment>

<comment>A hypothetical conversation when there wasn't even a vacancy and the Congress was in Republican control AND never even happened, isn't even remotely the same.In the same speech Biden said he would consider a Moderate nominee.</comment>

<comment>I personally think this speaks to the republicans' estimation of their own supporters - too stupid or vapid to stand on principle if it conflicts with their ideological leanings.  And in fact, most republicans will probably not be offended at all...</comment>

<comment>In the moment, too.  They seem to lack the ability to think beyond the current perceived threat to their ideology.</comment>

<comment>This it true.  I sometimes find myself wondering how the republicans will handle the eventual democratic payback.  But then I realize they quite possibly could ruin our democracy before the dems even get a chance.</comment>

<comment>Oddly its the Democrats getting the "payback" right now and you folks don't seem to like it much. ;)Perhaps you should have treated your political foes more fairly when you were in charge.</comment>

<comment>Payback for what exactly?  Was there a time when the Democrats actually refused to even go through hearings for a Presidential nominee?No...that's right.  This isn't pay back it is the GOP upping their record obstruction.  Record Filibusters.  Record Few Bills being passed.  Record wait time for nominees (even ones that they support).It isn't even comparable.</comment>

<comment>Payback for wholly partisan, "I have the votes" actions like the ACA.You should look up some time how many pieces of legislation Harry Reid kept from getting voted on.</comment>

<comment>Once again, one is by the Constitution.  The other isn't.  The fact you can't see this very simple distinction is quite telling to your partisan blinders.If they want to hold hearings and filibuster or reject every nominee. Whatever, that is their right as the majority.  The Constitution does specifically give them a job, and they are refusing to do it on ANY timetable.By your definition the Senate never has to hold votes EVER on ANY Presidential nominee because of some vague reference to a timetable.</comment>

<comment>And once again, not saying its not legal; just partisan. Which engenders other people to behave the same,.I'm just going by the Constitution, which does not require the Senate to act on a timetable convenient to the Executive.</comment>

<comment>It DOES require them to do it as some point though.  If they don't do it before this Congress ends, then they won't have fulfilled their job as stated by the Constitution.  This is quite simple.</comment>

<comment>At some point. But not necessary when its convenient for the Executive branch.Please cite for me the specific requirement that requires them to give a prior to this Congresses end.</comment>

<comment>"At some point."So they can wait until their terms are up?  That is what you are saying?  They don't have to do it at all?"Please cite for me the specific requirement that requires them to give a prior to this Congresses end."This is simple logic.  If they wait until THIS Congress ends.  Then THIS Congress didn't do their job, they are putting it on the NEXT Congress.  Which can then do the same thing.Your logic is absolutely horrendous.</comment>

<comment>So its YOUR "logic" that say so NOT what the Constitution that actually says that then? ;)I don't know what does the Constitution say about how long they can wait?</comment>

<comment>The Constitution says that Congress SHALL give advise and consent.If the 114th Congress fails to do this, then the 114th Congress will not have done their job.  They are leaving it to the 115th Congress, which can then make the same decision to not do their job.  But it doesn't change the FACT that the 114th Congress will have not Advised or Consented on a Presidential nominee.</comment>

<comment>lol, talk about false equivalence...</comment>

<comment>Obama's chickens coming home to roost? So to speak.yes, 'lol" ;)</comment>

<comment>Or President Obama's chickens coming home to roost--so to speak.You govern in a "I have the votes" fashion and you get it back.Take the ACA, the left jammed it down everyone's throats in wholly partisan fashion. Now they want to act all surprised that they get treated the same.</comment>

<comment>A law that was passed by the House and Senate, signed by the President, and reviewed by the Supreme court is not the same.</comment>

<comment>Which are distinctions without real differences in context.Which is President Obama tried and failed to do the same. Block a perfectly qualified candidate for wholly political reasons.And his own subsequent behavior as President--as mentioned the ACA was jammed down everyone's throat on a wholly partisan vote.Now the Left wants to act all surprised when they are treated as they treated others.</comment>

<comment>He didn't block anything.  He opposed a nominee who got hearings, and was confirmed.  This is an apples-to-air conditioners comparison.</comment>

<comment>Nope, he TRIED his best, he just failed.He filibustered what he himself said was a perfectly qualified candidate for wholly political reasons.His failure does not cancel out the attempt or why he did it.If you attacked me and tried to hit me, you failing to connect does mean you didn't attempt to assault me. And if I hit you back its not "different" because my aim is better..</comment>

<comment>Which is in no way comparable to the majority saying they will not hold hearings or a vote.</comment>

<comment>Again, right now.They are not saying they will NEVER hold a vote on anyone.Just not right now.And for like the 3td time please list for the specific passage that requires a co-equal branch of government to perform their function  in a time frame convenient to the Executive branch.</comment>

<comment>This is not about the President's timetable.  It's about the Senate's flat out refusal to do the job the Constitution requires.  Also, remember who said this?"Let's get back to the way the Senate operated for over 200 years, up-or-down votes on the president's nominee, no matter who the president is, no matter who's in control of the Senate"</comment>

<comment>Of course it is, like for the 4th time now, please present the requirement where a co-equal branch of government must act on the timetable convenient for the Executive Branch.They are not required to "do their job" on a timetable convenient to the Executive branch.Don't care whom said it. We don't decide Constitutional requirements based on quotes.</comment>

<comment>Sure, that's why the right wing media is all over part of Biden's statement.  In case you don't know, that was a quote from Mitch McConnell in 2005.And for the 4th time, McConnell is not talking time tables.  He is not going to do what the Constitution says the Senate shall do.  He committed to this within hours of Scalia's death.</comment>

<comment>I'm not dealing with Biden. Yet.Again, don't care. Again, we don't decide Constitutional requirements by quote.And if you want to play "quotes" you want to start dealing with all the stuff Obama changed HIS mind on? ;)And again, the Constitution simply  says "advice and consent" there is NO Constitutional requirement to do so on a schedule convenient for the Executive branch.Unless of course you can present one.</comment>

<comment>Please start in on the Biden.  McConnell and company have said in no uncertain terms that they will not provide advice and consent of any nominee brought by the President.  The Constitution says that the Senate shall provide advice and consent on the nominees of the President.  It's pretty simple.</comment>

<comment>Yeah pretty simple.They are NOT required to provide "advice and consent" on a timetable convenient to the Executive Branch.</comment>

<comment>Would McConnell go back on his promise and hold hearings and a vote if Obama nominated Ted Cruz?</comment>

<comment>Probably.  There's a better chance of McConnelll going back on his promise than of Obama nominating Cruz.</comment>

<comment>That would be shameful on McConnell's part.  I wonder if voters would punish such flip-flopping.  And if he did go ahead with the process, could he overcome a Dem filibuster of Cruz?</comment>

<comment>More proof that their loyalty is to their political party, not to their country, whose political system they game at every opportunity for partisan gain.</comment>

<comment>That statement easily applies to both sides.  It's all part of the game they play.</comment>

<comment>Their job is to represent the people who voted for them, and this is exactly what the people who voted for them want them to do.</comment>

<comment>We'll see on election day.This IS an article about their abysmal approval ratings, after all. </comment>

<comment>"...Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness."Perhaps it's time for a new government. One that works.Conservatives need a voice, but this is not the way. This is immature.Frankly, I am for dissolving political parties. Two opposing viewpoints is not an accurate crosssection of the opinions of 300,000,000 people.</comment>

<comment>I am a Republican but the party has gone so far to the right the past 10 plus years that I don't feel it's mine anymore. The reason that the Republican base is in revolt against the elites is because the elites refuse to work with the left when it makes sense. I'm shocked Roberts saved the ACA and that Ryan signed the omnibus bill given how obstinate and destructive the party has become. Trumps rising popularity is directly attributable to the mainstream GOPs hard right fascist turn. If the party had just cooperated with the left more often then it wouldn't be falling apart like it is now.</comment>

<comment>The principal reason for why our politics is messed up is that loudness is confused for consensus. That a crazed minority that screams and foams at the mouth the hardest is seen as representing a larger number than they actually hold.</comment>

<comment>To describe them as useless would be to compliment them. They are worse than useless, they are doing actual damage to the country and out system of government. </comment>

<comment>They should at least read the proposals and then vote them down. To refuse to even look over the documents that they are rejecting is simply not doing their job.</comment>

<comment>Well only wrong if we agree is wrong to wait whether you're a Republican or Democrat president.  Regardless to Biden's comment, I'd at least say there should be an understanding as to how you'll proceed.  Currently Obama is just one hand clapping and doesn't seem to care what the other is doing if it isn't clapping with him.</comment>

<comment>Obama is carrying out his duties on this matter according to the Constitution.  Why should he consult with Senate Republicans to see if they are going to do their duty?</comment>

<comment>problem is though there's isn't a timetable...the Senate isn't required to do anything within any period of time.  Even Biden recognized the President should work with them and that's only after he indicated the president shouldn't make a nomination in an election year.  Either way guys, how about just making an agreement.  Currently I don't see give and take just demands.</comment>

<comment>What sort of "give" should Obama offer?</comment>

<comment>actually I like what he's saying publicly...sounds like he's looking for somewhat of a consensus candidate  Likely the problem is that he wants to make the Senate look bad.  Don't get me wrong, I dislike Obama from a leadership standpoint but I generally also think he means well for the country ...he just does it at the expense of the Republicans.  He's a dyed in the wool Democrat and committed to their principals and getting them to win all areas of the government. ...nothing all that surprising right?</comment>

<comment>The other hand clapping is the Constitution that gives the President the absolute power to nominate a Supreme Court Justice with no caveats about the closeness to an election.</comment>

<comment>and he's completely entitled to do so...and the Senate is completely entitled to drag their heels....what's your point?</comment>

<comment>To me, there is a big difference between holding the confirmation hearing and voting against the President's nominee, and saying they won't even allow a vote on any nomination the President makes.</comment>

<comment>okay, fair criticism I guess...so do you think Biden was also just faking it? Was he wrong for proposing the very same thing to the Republican president then 24 years ago?  So either the position is wrong in both scenarios or right  in both...I'm happy either way.</comment>

<comment>Why Joe Biden’s 1992 Supreme Court comments aren’t a silver bullet for Republicans[H]e was speaking about a hypothetical (there was no court vacancy at the time). He was also speaking in June of an election year — not February — which is around the time something called the Thurmond Rule has traditionally kicked in. (Though congressional experts say the Thurmond Rule is less an actual rule and more of a guideline that both parties call on when politically expedient on when the Senate can shut down the judicial confirmation process.)https://www.washingtonpost.com...</comment>

<comment>meh, not so worried about it...the SCOTUS is a problem either way imho.  I don't think anyone cares about the silver bullet but I do think it's rather important to have an understanding...when there isn't one any expectation EITHER ways is just as silly as the opposing view.</comment>

<comment>Despite the hyped stories, Biden continued that he would be happy to work with then-President Bush to come to a consensus nominee.  McConnell just said no nominee.</comment>

<comment>I think it's all in approach, respect, and communication.  I don't see the president having any for the Republican leadership and they don't give any in return.  No matter what the Senate is legally justified in stalling...there's simply no mandate they have to do anything.  You may want them to...that's fine but there's no recourse for Obama ...this is just another grandstand by him.</comment>

<comment>If they don't do anything then that means they're not in session, and Obama can make recess appointments. </comment>

<comment>lol...well if we throw reality out the window, lets just fast forward in time through all this mess to a point in the future where we're a bit more stable of a country and respectful to each other  :)</comment>

<comment>Respect means Obama, a sitting president,  has the constitutional duty to appoint judges. </comment>

<comment>after he nominates and after they're ratified...that process can be extended as needed and will be.  His previous two choices show little consensus building and I'm thinking most Republicans won't have any more.</comment>

<comment>They don't have a choice. It's advise and consent. They don't get a choice over who is picked. That right belongs to the president. </comment>

<comment>Why should he give any respect to mister "my number one priority is to make Obama a one term President"?  And who within hours of Scalia's death announced that the Senate absolutely will not consider any Obama nominee?  Is this a respectful approach?  Is this communication?</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately this is the time in American history where we're a divided country and neither side gravitates to the middle but pushes out to the extremes.  When one wins with 51% they consider it a mandate to impose their will on the other 49%...do you really expect good feelings on either side?</comment>

<comment>No, but I expect them to do the jobs for which they're paid a very decent salary.</comment>

<comment>You know, i actually admire republicans the democrats are in no way this committed to getting what they want. sure many of the GOP are crazy but they will do ANYTHING to ram their agenda down your throat , no matter what the cost or moral consideration for others. Say what you will but they are much better at getting things done regardless of what those things are</comment>

<comment>I bet they could make the trains run on time!</comment>

<comment>Re: " they will do ANYTHING to ram their agenda down your throat"sort of like Obama and the ACA eh?</comment>

<comment>"Your [Republican Congressmen's] job is to work with other people, pass laws, and govern," says the author.That's just not true. Their job is to advance their constituent's views. Often, when the president is a leftist democrat, that is going to mean the most effective strategy is obstruction. Stopping the president from doing things you don't want is most definitely effective work.</comment>

<comment>lol...you're not telling the liberals/democrats what they want to hear...expect more wailing and gnashing of teeth</comment>

<comment>Obstinance and obstruction are not qualities of leadership. They are the strategy of cowards. They could negotiate with the president and get him to appoint a moderate. They could all vote down whoever is nominated. To think that throwing a tantrum is what their constituents want is just absurd.</comment>

<comment>I actually wouldn't bet on that.</comment>

<comment>Nor would I, lol</comment>

<comment>That's because you're not being objective.  Whether you agree or disagree with them, it's not a tantrum, it's a tactical move.  Albeit, one that could blow up in their face if the Democrats take the White House and Senate.  There are 4 possible results with the upcoming election and only one is a worse outcome, so it's hard to argue with their tactics.</comment>

<comment>A tantrum is a tactical move, albeit one that expresses powerlessness. They aren't powerless, they can and should negotiate for a reasonable moderate choice. They are holding out for some conservative takeover which is not going to happen. They also risk losing the cases for this term which they care about most with only 8 justices on the bench.</comment>

<comment>too much has been lost already, the future of options and potential is worth infinitely more...everyone on both sides knows this but some just refuse to say it out loud</comment>

<comment>What has been lost? What rights have been taken from you or anyone else?</comment>

<comment>are you just blinded by desire for your own way or ignorant? The desire in this type of situation by both parties is to effect a change on SCOTUS.  Given Obama is all about excluding white males whenever possible and has already appointed a Hispanic female and a Jewish female do you really think Republicans want more exclusion based on sex, creed, or race?</comment>

<comment>"Given Obama is all about excluding white males whenever possible"This is so tired.</comment>

<comment>lol...if it just wasn't so darned obvious ;)</comment>

<comment>Victim card. Race card. PC idiocy.If a black person said what you're saying about a white president, those are the phrases you'd reply with, so frankly, I don't give a shit about you and your little feelings.</comment>

<comment>Why the obsession over white males?  they already hold 5 seats on the court. Do you see no value in having the high court reflect the nation's diversity?</comment>

<comment>Right, Pres. Obama only looked at their ethnicity and gender when choosing SCOTUS nominees. You are blinded by your own prejudice</comment>

<comment>sure because no white male candidates but exist...otherwise if you're happy with these odds I'm sure you wouldn't have any problems allow the same to exist in the reverse situation.</comment>

<comment>Personally I would like a very liberal justice no matter what their ethnicity or religion or whatever else would be. If the situation were reversed I would want the Dem controlled senate to negotiate with a repub president to find a qualified moderate.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans are triggering a Constitutional crisis, with their obstruction. Article 2 is explicitly concerned with important decision-making prerogatives of the Executive, to fill Constitutionally named government offices. The purpose of the Article is giving the procedure for making appointments. Hence it's reasonable to assume that the Senate's prerogatives of 'advice and consent' are pursuant to accomplishing this goal. Blocking judgment on a nomination, through a peremptory refusal to vote on ANY nominee, runs precisely contrary to this goal. So, in light of this context it is reasonable to assume that if the Framers had intended that 'advice and consent' include the discretion to ignore the Executive's nominees, they would have rendered this explicitly in the text. They did NOT.So, it's not just a matter of trying to divine the precise meanings of 'advice and consent.' It's also about the very logic of making appointments, a logic embedded in the text. The Constitution gives the Executive the explicit power - and obligation - to make appointments to the Courts. These appointments are of course a practical necessity for the government to function - particularly in the case of the Supreme Court.'Advice and consent' is the Senate's veto-power on the President's nominees. Assent by the Senate is the sufficient condition for the elevation of the nominee. A sufficient condition, in other words, for the performance of a power that the Constitution explicitly states that the Executive has - the power of appointment. As long as the Senate acts positively on the nomination of the President's proposed candidate (i.e., assenting or rejecting the nominee) we don't have a problem.But when/if the Senate simply refuses to consider a nomination, the whole purpose of the Article 2 is defeated. With his nominee in Limbo, the President is powerless to act to appoint; he cannot nominate someone else while his original nominee is left to dangle. How is this not unconstitutional on its face? It strips a power from the President that the Constitution explicitly says he has; and moreover this is a clear violation of the separation of powers. And all the while, the crucial practical task of filling key government positions goes undone. No reasonable interpretation of the Constitution would say that the Framers were providing for the possibility of this kind of outcome.</comment>

<comment>Quite simply it's very constitutional...it was created with balance in mind.  The parties must work TOGETHER to accomplish anything.  Obama has sadly shown little willingness to be balanced in his appointments he nominates based on his desire to make the country more liberal.  Expect people not to work with you if you don't create balance...I'd suggest Obama nominate a conservative white male this time and see if the Republicans are willing to listen then.</comment>

<comment>The Senate's power to check the President comes in their prerogative to vote his nominees down, NOT in the blanket refusal to consider them. If the Framers had intended blanket refusal as an option, they would have been contradicting themselves. Quite simply, you're wrong and you are abetting a Constitutional crisis.</comment>

<comment>Love your wording it's at least fun.  A 'constitutional crisis' would be if this was not an issue for both sides. No one wants SCOTUS to stand against their political party's ideals. 3 liberal appointees during Obama's time simply isn't palatable.  His short list currently is an Indian-American male, African-American male, and a White-female...surely we see a pattern here...pretty blatant discrimination.  Given SCOTUS has been so politicized within recent memory it might serve to have a genuine constitutional crisis.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but your view is against the Constitution. The document does not say the the President's appointment power is conditional. You don't have to like his nominees, you can vote them down. But you can't deny his prerogative/obligation to APPOINT, and that REQUIRES that the Senate respond by ACTION (voting up or down) on the nominees. Stonewalling is tantamount to a denial of the power that the Constitution says the president has. It's just as unconstitutional, as if the president refused to nominate anyone.</comment>

<comment>just show me the mandated timetable you're referring to and I'll be your personal evangelist</comment>

<comment>It's not a point of following a timetable; it's the point of nullifying a timetable. If McConnell had kept quiet and slow-walked the hearings, we could complain but he would have plausible deniability on the charge of violating his oath. But he and his Senate crew don't have that, now. They are violating the law. (And by supporting them, you are complicit)</comment>

<comment>Yep -- only 33% female, as opposed to the 51% of the population.</comment>

<comment>So a blanket filibuster of a President Trump nominee (or blanket refusal to consider if Dems win the Senate) is ok?</comment>

<comment>Possibly if it withstands legal scrutiny and the people's ire...do it.  Sorry it's coming to this but when you have a president that blatantly discriminates, that stands in direct confrontation with the people's will (ACA), that intentionally refuses to ignore then attempt to circumvent laws (immigration) well this is what you get...I actually fear more that executive activism attempting to create more judicial activism will ultimately be met with much worse than 'constitutional crisis'</comment>

<comment>"Blatantly discriminates" - no idea what this would be in reference to.ACA - was passed by a majority of the House and Senate, was signed by the President, and reviewed by the Supreme Court.  There are laws on the books that I don't like, but this is a valid one.Immigration laws - nothing has been circumvented.  Obama increased border security forces, increased deportations, and used the same discretion all other executives do when determining the priority of those to deport.</comment>

<comment>there isn't a plow in existence that would pry your head from the hole in the ground you stick it in when you refuse to see the other side</comment>

<comment>I see the other side when it's coherent.</comment>

<comment>The Republicans are triggering a Constitutional crisis, with their obstruction.Again....</comment>

<comment>But their record-low approval rating isn't going to matter! The districts have been drawn such that conservatives are so concentrated that A) the Republican nominee is always going to win and B) the isolation from any liberal sentiment magnifies conservative beliefs to the point that, to conservative voters, blind obstruction to any Democratic initiative is doing the job.</comment>

<comment>Well, the courts are starting to catch on to the racial gerrymandering as well and have started forcing changes. Don't lose hope.</comment>

<comment>I want to believe...</comment>

<comment>Your president refuses to enforce the laws of this land and you come crying about obstructionism? I'm thinking you're going to find very little sympathy.</comment>

<comment>Congress' duty is to give their advice and consent. They aren't obligated to approve anyone's choice. Saying they simply won't entertain the idea is a dereliction of duty. Meanwhile, I'm struggling to think of any laws that Barack Obama has refused to enforce; he's rather famous for his record-breaking number of deportations, so it's not immigration. The pot legalization, I guess?</comment>

<comment>Don't bother. This man clearly gets his politics from the bumpers of rusty old Toyota pick-ups.</comment>

<comment>*sigh* I know. It's just depressing that I never seem to get any real discussion going from conservative commenters. I'm not entirely unsympathetic to conservatism, and my own ideals can only be improved from some reasoned opposition, but I'm starting to think that it's as dead a philosophy as Marxism.</comment>
