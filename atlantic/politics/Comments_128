<comment>This article ignores the tone and tactics of the Republican Party, which has, among other moves designed to alienate African-Americans, actively worked in states across the nation to suppress their access to polling places.The author is right that black voters can shift their allegiance. The GOP *should* be contending to attract them. And Latinos. And Asians. Instead, it's spiraling down in a vicious circle, as it appeals to a dwindling base of older, whiter people.</comment>

<comment>"This article ignores the tone and tactics of Republicans"Simpler version. They're not stupid, they see the RW commenters here and in other places online.Why vote for someone who's supporters don't want you?</comment>

<comment>why do you assume that because you can scare blacks into being afraid of the GOP, that the GOP is actually something blacks should be afraid of? You guys really do drink you're own koolaid.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Liberals do drink their own Kool-aide. They live in the liberal media bubble. They believe that conservative views are fringe because the only time they see them is in internet comments or when they are being derided by CNN et. al.SurveyUSA just did a nationwide head-to-head poll of Trump vs. Hillary. Trump won 45% to 40%. Trump got 25% of black support.http://www.surveyusa.com/clien...Immigration is a powerful issue to woo blacks away from the Democrats. If the GOP candidate takes 25% of the black vote in 2016, the Democrats are toast.</comment>

<comment>Trump is an extreme bigot that will get slaughtered in the general election. GOP are the party of the KKK you low information lemming.The Re­pub­lic­an elect­or­al co­ali­tion now re­lies on pre­pon­der­ant ma­jor­it­ies from the groups most un­settled by demo­graph­ic and cul­tur­al change: older, non-col­lege and rur­al whites. There are no longer enough of those voters to guar­an­tee Re­pub­lic­ans a na­tion­al ma­jor­ity: that’s why Demo­crats have won the pop­u­lar vote in five of the past six pres­id­en­tial elec­tions.You racist right wingers are toast in 2016. ;)</comment>

<comment>College voters actually slightly lean right. Post grads heavily lean left, but that's a different story. Democrats depend on poor immigrants and single women; two demographics which really have their limits. Latino immigrants are slowing in numbers due to lowering birthrates and industry growth; single women while growing, fail to reproduce as much as married women and their lack of children leads to a death of their cultural beliefs...</comment>

<comment>Conservatives depend on white bigots who are undereducated.Other Republicans have weighed in on this Democratic advantage. A recent commentary in Red State, a self-described right-of-center website, suggested the problem is even worse than Will said."After totaling the electoral votes in all the solid blue states, it becomes apparent that even a below average Democrat presidential candidate could begin the race with a whopping 246 advantage," the author said. "No wonder President (Barack) Obama was so confident of victory in 2012 for he knew the game was practically over before it began."University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said the hurdle for Republicans doesn't look any better if you count the underlying votes by citizens, not just the electoral results."Democrats have also won the popular vote in five of the last six presidential contests," Sabato said. "The demographic shifts heading to mid century are all pro-Democratic."</comment>

<comment>Exactly why we must never allow any suicidal Amnesty, and halt legal immigration, too.</comment>

<comment>Is that the crap being taught in our failed government schools?, that it was Republicans riding around on horseback lynching 3300 blacks and 1100 whites (most all of them Republican abolitionists)?  By the way, Bill Clinton never got above 50% of the vote.</comment>

<comment>and you right wingers have LOST THE POPULAR VOTE in the last 5 out of 6 presidential elections. Blacks overwhelmingly hate you republican KKK bigots.Other Republicans have weighed in on this Democratic advantage. A recent commentary in Red State, a self-described right-of-center website, suggested the problem is even worse than Will said."After totaling the electoral votes in all the solid blue states, it becomes apparent that even a below average Democrat presidential candidate could begin the race with a whopping 246 advantage," the author said.

<comment>The Democrats have won the popular vote in 5 of the last 6 elections mostly because they have been fortunate to have had very favorable environments in nearly all of those elections:1992: Republicans in office 12 years. Recession. Very favorable Democratic conditions. Republicans have no chance.1996: Democratic incumbent. Strong economy. No major international crises. Very favorable Democratic conditions. Republicans have no chance, unless maybe Colin Powell runs.2000: Democrats in power 8 years. Good economy. No major international crises. Academic models based on the fundamentals all predict a Gore landslide. Yes, Democrats eke out a popular vote win, but this election never should have been that close to begin with. GOP outperforms big time under Moderate Democratic conditions.2004: So-so economy. Questions starting to brew about involvement in Iraq. Neutral to slightly GOP environment due to national security concerns. GOP ekes out a narrow victory, consistent with the academic models.2008: GOP in power 8 years. Anger over war in Iraq. Complete economic collapse. Massively favorable Democratic conditions. Republicans have no chance in hell.2012: So-so economy. Misgivings over Obamacare. But country still blames GOP for economy, and not ready to trust them again so quickly. Moderately favorable Democratic conditions. The right GOP candidate, running a great campaign might possibly have been able to win (maybe Mitch Daniels, who passed up a bid), but it still would have been an uphill climb.So even if the country were divided exactly 50/50, there's not a single election in that group you can point to and say, "Yeah, the Republicans definitely should have won that one." They've basically been playing all road games, except 2004, which is the only election in the group where the academic models predicted a GOP win. The lone upset on the list was actually in the Republicans favor, in 2000.Yes, Democrats have a demographic advantage, which tilts the field in their favor in a close election. But it is not so great that the Republicans cannot win if they get an election held under favorable GOP conditions (e.g. the US slips into recession between now and next summer, or the stock market drops 30%). It remains to be seen whether 2016 will be or not - but if it is, they will likely win. That's just the way presidential elections usually work. </comment>

<comment>Why is someone immediately a bigot because they disagree with you. You sir have issues. You need to update information, especially birthrates and current immigrant trends. America is on the verge a huge increase of automation( ie robots working most labor jobs) and because of this the need of labor will decline. The immigration policy will be inclined towards the educated and this will reduce the need for poverty programs and big government.</comment>

<comment>You're stupid. Typical conservative.</comment>

<comment>Conservatism is a mental illness that WILL be eradicated in 2016. You low information lemming.</comment>

<comment>Fyi no one running is guaranteed electoral support; realistically you need heavy grass root support, financing and time. The get out the vote is critical in swing states and no candidate past Hillary is set up for that. Biden would have to be handed that from Obama, he'd have to race millions more to compete and he'd have to get out the vote for the democrats.... which is really hard given the weak economy, the betrayal on trade and  the fact almost no party wins three times in a row.</comment>

<comment>Dream on. Minority unemployment rate is just terrible. Racist solidarity is less important than paying the bills. GOP will increase its share of minorities in 2016 - and, unless it nominates a panderer like Bush or Kasich, it will hit 2/3 of white voters, and thereby crush the Democrat (also, the Dem candidates at this point are unusually weak).</comment>

And the most recent state polls have her behind Rubio by 12 in Florida, behind him again by 7 in Pennsylvania, and yet again down to Rubio by NINE POINTS in solid blue Michigan. She's also down by 7 to Kasich in Ohio.   There is no viable model for victory for Clinton  that does not include Michigan, Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania.</comment>

<comment>Nobody has to scare black people into being afraid of the GOP. All any black person has to do is listen to the likes of Donald Trump, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz, Maroc Rubio, etc. and right wing media such as Hannity, O'Reilly, and Limbaugh and come to a rational conclusion: "These people will not advocate for my best interest or concerns."</comment>

<comment>50 years of progressive politics have gotten the black community where?  The most segregated ever since....I don't know, since desegregation?  </comment>

<comment>In the last 50 years the tactics of conservative Americans embodied by the GOP is major factor re-segregation of America.Face it Steve, at its heart the American conservative movement is about continuing and expanding the economic, political and social power of white Christian males. They consider everybody else second-class citizens at best in America.</comment>

<comment>Yet in democratic bastions, desegregation is at it's highest rate since....desegregation.  Poverty highest, and so on.  In other states, the same things aren't seen.Face it, democratic talk sounds great, but the progressive ideals are leaving minorities behind, actually keeping them down.  54 shot in Chicago last weekend.   Baltimore?  Detroit?</comment>

<comment>Maybe I wasn't clear, but segregation is higher in the democratic states, namely the NE, than anywhere else.</comment>

<comment>No one cares moron.</comment>

<comment>You do dip shit.  Otherwise you wouldn't be such a freudian wet dream.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha explain about segregation again!</comment>

<comment>Greatest Rates of poverty and unemployment in the black community since the Depression.  The war on poverty has produced the same results as the war on drugs.  In fact, they are both self licking ice cream cones.  But yay...</comment>

<comment>Oh really?</comment>

<comment>Official unemployment for blacks averages twice that of white folks, that's a given.  Unofficially, those who are no longer looking for work is up closer to 19%.  You seriously don't know?That's the shell game the government plays with the numbers.  They don't count those who quit looking for work.  That's why 90 million people out of work isn't in all the headlines.</comment>

<comment>Reminds me of sf, where the progressive government loves to isolate black communities on the fringe. The population they claim to protect is shrinking before their eyes or forced on the other side of the bay.... or in many cases going to the south or Texas for jobs. Often in a populations that's far more integrated.</comment>

<comment>Seen and not heard.  Bullworth was more fact than fiction</comment>

<comment>As is economic inequality.</comment>

<comment>Well, in the southeast, at least it seems to pretty much suck for everyone equally, right?</comment>

<comment>Like in any democrat big city, you are the second class citizens.Black lives don't matter to Democrats, only their votes do.</comment>

<comment>Progressive politics gave black people desegregation and the civil rights act. It also got them affirmative action and the political clout for articles like this to be written about them.Meanwhile conservative politics have tried to take the vote away from black people with voter id, started the disastrous war on drugs, and have called our first black president a traitor, a monkey, a witchdoctor and worse. Why do articles like this fail to address the fact that the republican party basically panders to racists? That's the reason black people will never vote for them.</comment>

<comment>"That's the reason black people will never vote for them."So are you saying that the black people that do vote (R) are not black?</comment>

<comment>9 out of 10 black people vote democratic. Once you start splitting hairs like that you need to know that what you're saying is stupid and you need to shut up.</comment>

<comment>Highest black unemployment and poverty since the Depression.  And it's the insults directed at Bush.  But that's individuals, not an organized party.  I can find oh so many racist epithets used by the LINOs.</comment>

<comment>Actually the civil rights act passed with more republican than democratic votes.</comment>

<comment>I guess you don't know what progressive politics means.</comment>

<comment>So 50 years of progressive policies have produce the tremndous result of increasing the number of articles about the problems of minorities ?How does voter ID take away black votes ?98% of whites and 97% of blacks already have acceptable ID.Virtually every state that passed voter ID laws has provisions for voting without ID - by signing an affidavit that you are who you claim you are.The leading lights opposing the war on drugs in the past have been libertarian. Presently we are getting support from conservatives such as George Schultz.67% of republicans want to see and end to Marijauna proscription.“There’s no question that Obama is the worst president on medical marijuana.”Marijuana Policy Project Executive DirectorThe worst of George Bushes policies, have been put on steroids by Pres, Obama.You list all the names those on the right have called Obama. Yet left or right, what fits best is GWB IIWhy should blacks vote republican ?Because some republicans have learned from the disasterous progressive big government mistakes of George Bush. Democrats are still repeating them.</comment>

<comment>You have obviously swallowed Republican propaganda hook, line, and sinker. Probably because you're a racist white guy who thinks he's being oppressed by the government because minorities tell you that you can't talk trash about them any more. It's obvious because you act like voter ID is no big deal when it's been documented that hundreds of thousands of people have not been able to vote across multiple states because of voter ID laws that say they seek to prevent a fraud that has been documented as happening maybe 10 times in 20 years.http://www.motherjones.com/pol...I don't even know what your point is about marijuana.As for the mistakes of George Bush, the Republican platform has not changed in 30 years. You guys still give the rich tax breaks on the backs of the poor, cut education, destroy the envrionment and run the southern strategy of demonizing black people to appeal to the baser natures of whites. Just look at O'Reilly, Rush, Hannity, and on and on.You think you can call black people criminals, drug addicts, ignorant etc and still get their vote? Lol. You think you can treat Obama the way the GOP did and get black votes?! The problem with the GOP and white people like you is that you really think you're better and smarter than other people. You think you can fool people with your BS. Well you're not, and you can't and it just makes you look like an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Wow you just asserted someone was racist because they had a different opinion and you quote mother Jones, aren't you special!? Definitely not objective and you're as generalized in tone as trump, good luck with that!</comment>

<comment>You can google poll after poll regarding voter id and you'll see that it is supported by a large margin, by republicans, by democrats, by black voters, by the elderly, by virtually any and every demographic segment in existence BUT for liberal democrats.  Which evidently includes you.  Given that, thanks to Obama's inepitude and boorishly ignorant refusal to govern according to the consitution there are now more republicans in office than at any time since 1928, we will see voter id become the law of more and more states.</comment>

<comment>Yes, unfortunately we live in a country where people who do not understand the issue are asked loaded questions and their answers taken as the informed will of the public.Do you support voter ID, a policy that will prevent voter fraud?Well, voter fraud seems bad and I have my ID already so I'll say yes.People who actually understand the issue know that asking someone who does not have an ID to make arrangements to get one (taking off work, paying processing fees) in order  to exercise their franchise is akin to a poll tax and is unconstitutional.Further many studies have shown that voter fraud is a made up issue. And one that follows in a long line of white attempts to politically disempower their enemies under the guise of righteousness.http://mediamatters.org/resear...Also this lol - Voter ID will help Mitt Romney win the state of PA.https://www.youtube.com/watch?...And lastly it's funny that a charge of unconstitutionality comes from a person who's party's MO is holding the government hostage with budget threats to bypass the legislative system so they can get laws passed they couldn't otherwise. You don't understand what the constitution says and just throw the word around like a bludgeon. People like you are the worst kind of American.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention, polls show that a majority of black voters support voter id.</comment>

<comment>So basically in your mind, in order for progressives to succeed over decades.... there can't be any republicans around!? Nothing is your parties fault and you have a fairly low standard of true economic accomplishment!? Just scape goat....</comment>

<comment>Republicans have demonized education. They rewrite history, and create their own schoolbooks to brainwash their children. They stoke racial hatred in all you idiots so they can pass their economic agenda which has resulted in the largest wealth disparity in a hundred years. The thing that is so infuriating is that Republicans have already got their money for Karl Rove and the southern strategy and and now the rest of the country has to deal with idiots like you.</comment>

<comment>Everyone is racist when they disagree with you because you lack a coherent argument and you use that as your mental crutch! Never mind my immediate family is far more diverse than most people: from Asian, to black, and white.  But the truth doesn't matter to you. </comment>

<comment>But wait until white people start voting uniformly (75%+) for the GOP. Then see what the socialists win. (BTW, this ethnic spoils system is exactly why we never should have allowed nonwhite immigration, and should halt it now.)</comment>

<comment>Provide specific quotes.   People like Hannity and Limbaugh have done nothing but SUPPORT black GOP candidates and politicians.  You sir, are a bigot.</comment>

<comment>They support black GOP puppets who spout the party line which supports the system to uphold white supremacy? Yes. And lol at the white dude calling me a bigot.</comment>

<comment>Ha ha, you assume I'm white with no evidence.   O'Reilly has absolutely nothing in common politically with Limbaugh or Hannity.  The only thing these guys have in common is that they're all white.  Why not list any black conservatives who have the same politics as Limbaugh, like Thomas Sowell or Ben Carson?  Doesn't fit the narrative, Mr. Racist?</comment>

<comment>Trump's policy on illegal immigration benefits Blacks much more than Hillary's does. Requiring ID to vote supresses the illegal alien vote (yes, some do try to vote and some succeed) not the Black vote. Blacks aren't so pathetic that they can't figure out how to get a government ID and often those are free for low-income voters. Blacks are more likely to prosper when their wages aren't being driven down by illegal aliens.Dem policis on immigration are very hard on working class and working poor Americans who are disproportionately minority. Blacks aren't so stupid that they can't figure it out.Both the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the US Commission on Civil Rights USCCR) report that Dems' amnesty drives down wages and employment rates on working class and working poor Americans who are disproportionately minority. The USCCR reported that illegal immigration also drives up incarceration rates for Black men. The USCCR report stated that legal status and family reunification would be "economically devastating" for Black workers specifically. It's the Dems working to deliberately inflict that damage and it's Repubs trying to stop it (only because of their base; Repub pols are just as corrupt as Dem pols but the fact remains that only Repubs oppose doing that damage).The other thing Blacks are figuring out is that the people who control the areas where Black life is the hardest and bleakest are Dems. The Tea Party doesn't control Detroit, or Baltimore, or Atlanta. Those are Dems doing that damage and Blacks know it.Hannity, Limbaugh, and O'Reilly don't speak for nor control the Repub party. They are hacks just like the hacks on MSNBC. No one with any brains takes them seriously or cites them as any reason for anything.Good grief.</comment>

<comment>True. The right going for new Jim Crow laws doesn't make an appealing picture. The Blacks in the top income 1% should vote for the right, but economically it doesn't make a lot of sense for the 99&, just as that's true for whites.</comment>

<comment>You've got that exactly backward. You've been lapping up the propaganda.The CBO reports that Dems' S.744 amnesty drives down wages for at least a decade and drives up unemployment for much of a decade (from The Economic Impact of S.744... at cbo.gov/sites/default/files/11.... Democrats are making high unemployment and stagnant wages WORSE for American workers and American families. But those effects aren't evenly distributed. Wages are driven down most on unskilled and low-skilled Americans -the working poor and working class- who are disproportionately minority. The report also notes that S.744 increases the return on capital. That means the rich get richer even faster.It's the Dems making the rich even richer even faster while literally shoving more working class Americans into poverty. It's the Dems deliberately driving down wages on the working poor and working class Americans who are disproportionately minority but white working class and working poor Americans suffer just the same under Dem policies.The US Commission on Civil Rights also reported that the Dems' immigration policies are damaging to working class and working poor Americans who are disproportionately minority. In fact, the USCCR reported that illegal immigration drives down wages, drives down employment rates, and drives UP incarceration rates for Blacks to such an extent that it is indeed a violation of their civil rights for their government to systematically undermine them so directly. The USCCR reported that legal status and familly reunification would be "economically devastating" to Black workers specifically.http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/Ille... (statements below quoted directly)TITLE: The Impact of Illegal Immigration on the Wages and Employment Opportunities of Black WorkersIllegal immigration to the United States in recent decades has tended to depress both wages and employment rates for low-skilled American citizens, a disproportionate number of whom are black men (p3).Dr. Hanson‘s coauthored research suggested that a 10 percent immigrant-induced increase in the labor supply is associated with a 4 percent decrease in black wages, a 3.5 percent decrease in the black employment rate, and a 0.8 percent increase in the black incarceration rate (p5).Dr. Briggs stated that about 12 million illegal immigrants are currently in the U.S. labor market, ... and that in his view, further legalization of such immigrants with family reunification would be economically devastating to low-wage workers of all races and black workers in particular (p8).Dr. Briggs also stated that the inflow of immigrants has resulted in low-skilled wages not rising over time. He viewed the reduction of both wages and jobs as a massive violation of the civil rights of all low-skilled workers, and of black workers in particular (p9).Dr. Briggs objected strongly to what he viewed as the use of public policy to drive down wages artificially. Dr. Jaynes agreed on that point, noting that this is indeed a civil rights issue, since such policy was being used to trample on the rights of all workers by driving down wages and avoiding employment rights.... Dr. Briggs responded that it was, since deliberate failure to enforce the law was responsible for the wage suppression, and such action was indefensible (p13).</comment>

<comment>Nice; but democrats really don't care about the well being of their constituency, just their votes.</comment>

<comment>The same goes for conservatives. Conservatives rely on low information white hate filled bigots.</comment>

<comment>You vote conservative now?</comment>

<comment>No, conservatism is a mental disease that needs to be eradicated.</comment>

<comment>lol, and we're the bigots.  Got it.</comment>

<comment>Yep. I finally caught on.I'm still an independent voter; now I just know better than to ever vote for Dems.Good grief what a pack of miserable liars.</comment>

<comment>Jews in the US have wealth, power and influence. The GOP go out of their way to sway them over any other minority group. Yet, the Jewish vote has never turned in Republicans favor.If Jews, which almost all are White, won't turn en masse. What makes one think Blacks would turn?</comment>

<comment>Neither the Jews nor the Blacks have to "turn en masse" to change the result of the election. Even a 5% switch can change the result in certain states.</comment>

<comment>As I said to others in this conversation thread: You're not going to get them.  Jews are the third big bogeyman for the right to push using the southern strategy after blacks and hispanics.You don't get Asians either because they don't particularly like being patted on the head and patronized.</comment>

<comment>If blacks voted for republicans in the late teens, the democratic party would lose election after election. With a lower birthrate among the black community and a push for school choice,I can see that shift coming. It won't have to be 50/50. But it's inherently unhealthy that they vote this way and that the democratic party is almost actively shunning white folks away from their party... especially when working class whites were its bread and butter.</comment>

<comment>Here's one reason to think Blacks might stop voting for Democrats-http://rebelpundit.com/chicago...Major Edit: I first pasted just my notes; this is the transcription now. I provided the transcription here, but you should watch the video; the testimony given by these men is compelling. I suspect it reasonates with others also.http://rebelpundit.com/chicago...Rebel pundit video transcriptionThe gentleman speaking in this video are:Paul McKinleyMark CarterJoseph WatkinsHarold "Noonie" WardBlack folks are an abusive Black leadership relationship.We have to send a message that this is the time for us to send a messageWe're always talking about what Republicans haven't done for us or what they will do to hurt us. My life has been hurt by Democrats.And we've got in our minds that we always got to keep voting Democrat.Look and see in your community. Who are the real oppressors in our communities?They're always talking about Black on Black crime. And when you hear the word Back-to-back crime, the first thing you think of is a Black man robbing you or a Black man breaking in to your house. And that is a Black on Black crime.  But let's take it one step further.There's a Black on Black crime down in city hall. There's a Black on Black crime down in all the state capitals in America, where Black folks are voting against our interests, where Black folks are voting and we're getting poorer and poorer and other groups are getting richer and richer.Everywhere you go, there's poverty in Black areas.This lot where I'm standing right now .... public housing ... most the people are homeless, living in the street. And it's because of you,  Mr. President.In Detroit, where are your leaders at? There's no white folks running Detroit, cutting off water on Black folks in Detroit. Those are Black folks running that city. That's not white folks doing that;  those are Black folks going along with that. Everything that's happening in our community is Black leadership doing this.Our children know if Democrats have not done anything for us as of yet, why should they even go out and vote.  What agenda is on the table that's going to change their lives?The only thing they're offering the Black community is abortion on demand. This is what the president ... for us to vote for.Now he wants to have this conversation about minimum wage raise because he knows this is the way to get a lot of the poor people's attention.The hell with his minimum wage raise. We don't have any jobs. A minimum wage rause for what?They're not pushing a Black agenda. They're not pushing a family agenda.  They're pushing a neo-liberal agenda.Across this city, these major Democratic cities, this us what it looks like (he's pointing to blight and decay).How can the same process happen over and over again and nobody can't do nothing about it.Black leadership is abusing us. The Democratic party is abusing us.It's the same way in every Black community across the country.And they force us into a life of welfare. We don't want welfare. We want opportunities to go to work. We want opportunities to own businesses.They bailed out all of the major banks and these big investors but left the people starving.There are no tea parties in the (?) cities.We don't have those people. We have a major Democratic machine and the majority of them they look like me. These are the people who make sure we get nothing but then turn around and have us to vote for them again.They only come around when it's time for elections. They think they can give you a toy or a turkey or something and everything is good.Hundreds of millions of dollars are coming down from the federal government. But the money is going to all these special interest groups. My Brothers keeper went to his frjrnds. This whole corrupt Democratic system that gobbles up all the dollars and starves the people out.Can you all look around your community and see any change that has come about with these hundreds of millions of dollars that have come through our cities? No you cannot. What we do see is our elected officials riding around in new cars and they have new homes.When our people don't have jobs in our communities, when we don't have any vital resources, when all the deals have been cut and our all our people are left out, this is where we end up (he is pointing to the cook county DOC max security).And we got our most important thing that we got that we can stop all this; everybody's got a vote and if you use your vote wisely you can stop a lot of this stuff.</comment>

<comment>Republicans don't go after the "jewish" vote- they go after the Christian Zionist vote</comment>

<comment>American 'Jews' are often secular and almost shouldn't be called Jews.</comment>

<comment>I did a lot of snickering several years ago too, when the Tea Dolts were ranting about how terrified we all were of Sarah Palin (snicker) and that she would be the next POTUS (chortle).Some things never change.</comment>

<comment>hahaha you ARE terrified of her; you always have been. That's why you direct such an inordinate amount of hate at her.And Palin was running for VP, not POTUS. Add that to the long list of idiotic things you've said today.Wow, I still remember how the GOP obssessed over Geraldine Ferraro and tried to destroy her personally, after her failed VP bid. Wait...oh yeah - that didn't happen.</comment>

<comment>Destroy her personally? Running for VP made Sarah Palin so rich she quite her job as Governor halfway through her first term to go on a book tour and take several jobs in the media instead. Oh yeah, we're shaking in our boots at your reality TV star.I'm sorry, "reality TV star" is no longer specific enough to describe only one Republican leader. I was talking about Sarah Palin, but we're not afraid of Trump either.</comment>

<comment>1) Palin was million in debt when she resigned because of your hate campaign against her. Remind us all how many of those fraudulent ethics lawsuits were found to be valid? Z-E-R-O2) This is the 21st century, dude...from now on, most every presidential candidate will probably have been a "reality star" at some point.3) Obama just went to Alaska to be a reality star last week.4) At least people want to see our reality stars - remind us all how many reality shows Hillary, Biden, or Sanders are in?</comment>

<comment>The other day I had the TV on in the background and Sarah Palin was on giving an interview. The interviewer asked her a question about the Kardashians. She said something along the lines of, “Well ya’ know I love their show but I sure wish that I had their job. I mean, it seems like all they do is get paid to sit around and gossip all day.”This was on Extra.</comment>

<comment>Nice try, clown. The Tea Dolts were all shrieking about Palin eventually becoming president, even after she had proved to the world that she was a fraud and a nit-wit.</comment>

<comment>Sarah Palin...Vice President of the United States.   I still can't believe that was even tabled as an option.Also..(Dismissive Guffwaw)...followed by...(HEARTY CHORTLE!)(High Five!)</comment>

<comment>Nobody, and I mean nobody, brings out the long knives against a VP candidate and is still talking about them seven years later unless they fear the potential of that candidate.Sarah Palin was the Dem ideal of a candidate -- populist, handsome, appealing to masses of fans, female and married to a part-Inuit husband to boot. In 2008, she was the only person who dared attack The One, who was being reported on like some sacred personage, a priest-king of old, by the media. And she did so effectively!That's why the Dems had to destroy her. You believe what the Dems said about Sarah Palin because you believe anything they say. If they say Palin is stupid and Biden is smart, no evidence to the contrary will ever convince you, abundant though it is.</comment>

<comment>Actually, the reason I still bring her up occasionally in conversations like these is because it illustrates a very troubling aspect of politicking right now...mainly that a certain political stripe is actively extolling the virtue of being wilfully ignorant.She basically became the poster child for a concerted effort by the right to indict the concept of expertise.That's an extremely dangerous road to travel.And keep in mind, that woman just went on record believing that she's actually qualified to be the head of the Department of Energy.I don't think anyone under doctorate or equivalent level has ever held the post, which seems more than appropriate.Then again, she did say she wanted to be head of it in order to dismantle it.Because that's where the GOP is at now.</comment>

<comment>If nothing else, making that porn movie should've disqualified her from the GOP ticket.</comment>

<comment>"Got that, chuckles?" Oooh, big man! Big man! Tough guy.Anyway ... the "ObamaCare one" is working quite well now, thanks. Trump's website is serving static content. Healthcare.gov  is a complex site linking numerous databases.But big, tough man don't care about nuance, right?</comment>

<comment>Stop...making...an...ass...of...yourself...</comment>

<comment>Hahaha you actually responded even though you don't know what you're talking about?! Bravo. Would you like to expound on what policies Democrats have enacted that are worse for the black community than the active disenfranchisent attempted by the GOP via voter ID or the destruction of the black family unit by the disastrous Republican war on drugs?</comment>

<comment>Dude, I have posted here many, many times about the Democrat support for free trade and mass/illegal immigration which has decimated African-American job prospects for decades.So keep on doing your "Hahaha" thing if it helps your digestion or whatever.</comment>

<comment>So you think free trade, a system espoused by both parties, is worse than what Republicans are doing now trying to reinstutute a poll tax and disenfranchise black voters? Or the destruction to the black family unit by the war in drugs? Or even all of the blatent racist attacks by the GOP? You really have no idea what you're talking about, and are obviously a clueless white racist spouting BS you heard on O'Reilly that you don't even understand.</comment>

<comment>You obviously know nothing at all about economics.  Why are you even posting? Go study the economic effects of free trade, if you can find some kind of "For Dummies" book in easy language,  before you blab about subjects you don't understand.</comment>

<comment>Lol it's so much fun talking to such an idiot. I know what free trade is. It's really not that hard a concept. You have no sense of history to know that the first free trade agreement was signed by Reagan and is a Republican idea. Must be hard to keep your positions straight when your party has no integrity.</comment>

<comment>And you're not even going to touch how the GOP is a bunch of racist white guys desperately trying to preserve the status quo by any means necessary right? Good move.</comment>

<comment>Who could take a dickhead post like yours seriously enough to respond to its "content"?</comment>

<comment>Check this out: http://rebelpundit.com/chicago...At least some are figuring out that they're in an abusive relationship with Democrats and Black leadership. I posted the full transcript several comments above. Holler and I'll post it again if you like.</comment>

<comment>Actually, the Donald is at that 60% point beating the traditional RINO (more like Democrat lite) and he has all sorts of support from minorities (black and Hispanic) to reinforce it. Mr. Trump, unlike the Democrat Party doesn't divide by race, by class or by sex. That's exactly what Obama has done and all Americans see that quite clearly and how ultimately self-destructive it is...the Community Organizer-in-Chief does every bit of that by agitating all the disparate elements within the Democrat Party and it looks very bad. Why does Bernie Sanders, who isn't a Democrat, now getting all that support, draining Hillary's numbers? Despite the fact that he isn't directly connected to Democrats but does vote with that caucus, his numbers are soaring. Nope..like Ronald Reagan, Donald Trump is wiping out the Uni-Party in DC. Everyone can see it. The real blood in the water is establishment political class of both parties in the DC Beltway. Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch. Stock up on popcorn...more's coming.</comment>

<comment>Bingo!No, I mean I got "bingo." All the talking points are here!</comment>

There is that added benefit of course that well over 100 million human beings have died because of those ideas, as well, and still going strong.</comment>

<comment>VoterID is not voter suppression; it's just a lie leftists in America tell their constituents to make them fear the GOP.Go to the UN website, and look up their standards for ensuring a free and fair election - voterID is at the top of the list. Do a google search of Nelson Mandela and voterID...you'll see him addressing a stadium in south Africa, wearing a green shirt that says, "Register. Get an ID. Vote."What is it with you people that you think you can blurt out things as patently absurd as, "voterID is voter suppression", and we're all supposed to smile and nod grimly as if you've said something that isn't completely insane?</comment>

<comment>Voter ID being fair hinges on access to voter ID being fair. Wisconsin tipped their hand when they started messing with the DMV - more DMVs with longer hours in Republican areas, fewer in Milwaukee and other Democratic areas.</comment>

<comment>oh please. BS. You actually think there's enough voters without ID that such a thing is even possible? You're derranged.It's not like they need to get a new ID for every election. Please, tell us how many "poor black Democrat" voters does the shorter hours disenfranchise? Go on, give us a number.</comment>

<comment>Ask and ye shall receive!</comment>

<comment>gee, then why can't these voters who are apparently "bursting at the seams to vote"...just go to another DMV? Or just make an effort? They've managed to live most of their adult life without an ID card...and it's suddenly the GOPs fault that they don't have one now?My God, do you even listen to yourself?I mean, you don't even take a moment to question the speciousness of getting your data from onewisconsinnow - a Progressive political machine. You don't know how they arrived at that number, and there is no data to support their interpretation of it.</comment>

<comment>Actually, some judges do.</comment>

<comment>Voter ID opponents are SO dishonest with the numbers. The first thing they do is compare voter rolls with driver's license rolls, then proclaim to the gullible that "300,000 people will be disenfranchised under Voter ID!" because they don't have driver's licenses.Of course they don't mention that 250,000 of those people are dead or moved out of state 10 years ago, or that the remaining 50,000 can get a free State Voter ID or vote on other kinds of ID. They pulled this shite in Pennsylvania, which accepted nine forms of ID! Then they go judge-shopping for a Dem-appointed judge who will buy the hog-swill.This I know: Democrats aren't engaging in these hysterics for the slight difference of 10,000 inner city votes here and there. They are doing it to exacerbate racial tensions, a core Democrat election strategy, and to maintain their Ace in the hole -- their margin of fraud in close elections -- all those registered voters who will never show up at the polls, but who can be voted so easily in case of need.</comment>

<comment>There are more voters without ID than ineligible voters attempting to vote illegally. Yet, you're concerned so much with stopping the latter that you wish to stop even more of the former. Which would actually skew the results of an election?</comment>

<comment>Um...and the Democratic party is helping forward the interests of Black Americans?Really?  I don't think so.  I think the establishment of both parties are misserving US citizens of all ethnicities on many levels.CURRENTLY OVER 50 PERCENT OF WORKING AGE BLACK ADULTS ARE UNEMPLOYED OR UNDER EMPLOYED IN LA COUNTY.http://www.labor.ucla.edu/what..."California has a higher share than the rest of the nation of illegal immigrants from Mexico.It has more illegal immigrants overall than any other state—an estimated 2.6 million. ". "In California, twice as high as in the rest of the nation, about 9 percent of workers are illegal immigrants. According to one estimate, 14 percent of workers in Los Angeles County are in the informal economy and more than half (61%) of those workers are illegal immigrants.""Male illegal immigrants have particularly high labor force participation rates, with more than 90 percent in the workforce. Wage and employment levels here are much higher than in immigrants’ home countries. For example, the average U.S. wage for production workers in manufacturing is about nine times higher than in Mexico, a ratio that has changed very little in over two decades"http://www.ppic.org/content/pu..."In this recessed United States, competition for all work is dog-eat-dog. But that holds especially true for low-skilled jobs, jobs for which high school dropouts (like Spriggs) and reformed criminals (also like Spriggs) must now vie against nearly 12 million illegal immigrants, 80 percent of whom are from Latin America. What's more, it seems that, in many cases, the immigrants are winning. From 2007 to 2008, though Latino immigrants reported significant job losses, black unemployment, the worst in the nation, remained 3.5 points higher.“I don't believe there are any jobs that Americans won't take, and that includes agricultural jobs,” says Carol Swain, professor of law at Vanderbilt University and author of Debating Immigration. “[Illegal immigration] hurts low-skilled, low-wage workers of all races, but blacks are harmed the most because they're disproportionately low-skilled.”Despite President Fox’s assertion, of the Pew Hispanic Center’s top six occupational sectors for undocumented immigrants (farming, maintenance, construction, food service, production and material moving), all six employed hundreds of thousands of blacks in 2008. That year, almost 15 percent of meat-processing workers were black, as were more than 18 percent of janitors. And although blacks on the whole aren’t involved in agriculture at anywhere near the rates of illegal immigrants—a quarter of whom work in farming—about 14 percent of fruit and vegetable sorters are African-American.For their efforts, African Americans were paid a median household income of $32,000 in 2007. In the same year, the median household income for illegal immigrants was $37,000."http://www.theroot.com/article...</comment>

<comment>There is super majority support for voter id among blacks.The left practices this nonsense all the time. "If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it, people will eventually come to believe it. "Goebels.Republicans are racist - why ? Because the left says so.They want to supress black votes - why ? because the left says so.Thus far the evidence is that Voter-ID has no disparate impact by race.It likely makes no difference in the outcome of elections. But it does improve our confidence in the results. Claims that dead people or non-citizens are voting or that people have voted twice and diminished.The GOP should not be vying to attract "minority" voters. It should focus on getting the government monkey off all our backs. Greater individual freedom improves life for all. Limited government improves life for all.The ideas of the left are moldy and rotting. We are in the worst recovery since the great depression, because the left has fixated on trying to grow government.Our standard of living rises for all ONLY when we produce more. Anything else is zero sum and pits us against each other.We have had six years of sniping and back stabbing - because the left has no workable plan to produce more.Do you care if the top 1% are 10 times better off, if you are 5 times better off ?\We can have absolute equality - with absolute poverty.Rather than envying those who have more.  Demand that government cease blocking your opportunities to join them.The greatest victims of big government are poor and minorities.Eric Garner is dead for the high crime of selling loose cigarettes.</comment>

<comment>Blacks and Latinos do not necessarily have common interests. Illegal immigrants cost Blacks lots of jobs.</comment>

<comment>Latest poll has 25% of Blacks voting for Trump.  The majority of Blacks support voter ID.</comment>

<comment>Asian Americans actually split in the most recent national election. Because of the distribution of where Hispanics live in the US, their impact on outcome is somewhat diminished. The 'older, whiter' meme is silly and racist. EVERYONE is getting older. You have to have that explained to you? Holy smokes.</comment>

<comment>Asians hate you right wing bigots.Other Republicans have weighed in on this Democratic advantage. A recent commentary in Red State, a self-described right-of-center website, suggested the problem is even worse than Will said."After totaling the electoral votes in all the solid blue states, it becomes apparent that even a below average Democrat presidential candidate could begin the race with a whopping 246 advantage," the author said. "No wonder President (Barack) Obama was so confident of victory in 2012 for he knew the game was practically over before it began."University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said the hurdle for Republicans doesn't look any better if you count the underlying votes by citizens, not just the electoral results."Democrats have also won the popular vote in five of the last six presidential contests," Sabato said. "The demographic shifts heading to mid century are all pro-Democratic."</comment>

<comment>I never understand how anyone can vote against their personal interest. While most blacks lean towards the Democratic party, the Republican party has increasingly become hostile to blacks in recent years - recall the Willie Horton Ads and before that, Reagan's speech in MS, and even more recently their whole notion of "taking our country back" since the election of one Barack Obama as president. And let's not forget a Republican president lack of response to Hurricane Katrina and New Orleans or Mitt Romney's 47% comments plus their opposition to raising the national minimum wage as well as their push legislatively, to suppress the black vote.In short, the collective memory of blacks regarding which party got their back runs deep and will not easily be put aside especially since the Republican party is not making significant effort to court votes from blacks. So yes, the Democratic party will retain a large portion of black votes for a long time to come.</comment>

<comment>Yet people vote against their interest, or at least their surface economic interest, all the time. That was the message of Thomas Frank's book What's the Matter with Kansas?, and of Milton Himmelfarb's observation that Jews "earn like Episcopalians and vote like Puerto Ricans."http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01...</comment>

<comment>"Suppress the black vote" How? By requiring Voter ID cards? The only people who could be against this simple procedure of obtaining Voter ID cards are those that would benefit from the voter fraud it allows. It's a very simple procedure. Why should ACT taking students et al. submit it and not Voters? Makes no sense to be against it. </comment>

<comment>Completely disingenuous. Individual voter fraud happens at a minuscule, insignificant rate. Republican efforts to combat it really aim to diminish the vote of groups that tend to vote for Democrats. For instance, decreasing early voting and voting hours disproportionately hurts minority group access to the ballot. Likewise, the GOP-controlled Texas legislature allowed handgun licenses, but not college IDs, to be used to prove identity when voting."Voter ID - which is going to allow Governor Romney to win the State of Pennsylvania - Done!" - Pennsylvania House Republican leader Mike Turzai, June, 2012. https://youtu.be/EuOT1bRYdK8Edit: To those commenters here who allege widespread voter fraud - provide factual evidence of it or shut up. Your wanting it to be so proves nothing. This myth has been conclusively debunked. http://www.brennancenter.org/s... http://www.washingtonpost.com/... </comment>

<comment>Fools only count the ones caught. That's like comparing shoplifters that are actually caught. The crime rises exponentionally. Who cares what party they vote for- a criminal is a criminal. If no Repubs are doing this, that tells me all I need to know about the Dem party. Stop with the lame excuses.</comment>

<comment>Voter fraud is not common as easily combated/identified for one thing as well the risks of committing are exceedingly high; you will go to jail if caught.  Further, elections are already much more easily rigged in this country by Gerrymandering or other "behind the scenes" maneuvering which is still completely legal in this country; its far too low of a margin play for individual voter fraud going through the whole process; if you're willing and going to commit such a crime, as evidenced by fraudulent elections worldwide or in history, you just pay connected political insiders behind the scenes to stuff the ballot box..even this is difficult though in any place that keeps track of voters' names as these can be cross checked right after; then one has to go to means like voter intimidation, physical threats, eliminating transparency, etc.; otherwise its like busting open parking meters for coins in broad daylight; i.e. not something that really happens as the crime ain't worth the dime.</comment>

<comment>In effect, with your logic I could justify literally any law enforcement policy on the grounds that we aren't catching all of the people who are getting away with a given crime, even (and maybe especially) in the absence of any evidence whatsoever to back up such a claim. It's an endless cycle of self-justification that has no basis in reality. So much for small gov't, eh?lost in the stars is not the one who is appearing lame in their reasoning.</comment>

<comment>If no Repubs are doing thisThat's adorable, it is.</comment>

<comment>Oh, okay. So it happens and you KNOW it happens, gosh darnit, and you can't prove it, but who cares, since you KNOW it to be so!</comment>

<comment>You are either ignorant, naive, or dishonest to push for no Voter ID. Dems benefit from the fraud. Your arguments are foolish and smart people don't fall for it. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>keep repeating the lie, maybe someone will believe it. Meanwhile 85% of the population wants voterID...</comment>

<comment>I'm not so sure.A researcher in KS performed statistical analyses of voting patterns in in Sedgwick County, where Wichita is located, and some very, very odd patterns appeared in the data.And making matters even more murky, the Sec State of KS has refused to comply with the state's public disclosure laws.http://www.kansas.com/news/pol...It could very well be that the Voter ID campaign is nothing more than a distraction why the pols manipulate the machines into doing their bidding.</comment>

<comment>I feel your pain.</comment>

<comment>It's egregious; and what's more sickening often its foreign news outlets like Al Jazeera or the India Times that blow holes in just how sick American democracy is and isn't an example to be emulated.Voter ID is only one fraction of which if we're going to require, the responsibility should then be on the state to identify its citizens.  Further then ID's need to be closer to the "real" type and not state issued drivers' licenses of which they also then need to be free and easy to obtain; likely on the same day as voting..in fact though why is Election Day still a day?  -We've got computers and Internet, people should be able to vote online from their own homes for a month before the actual final day!; Obama got grief for the ACA website; the GOP's made it so there is no electronic or online voting at all!  Just to give examples, India's had electronic since 1982 and over 400 million people use in their elections which is more people than every man, woman, and child in our country!  Others have had since the mid-90s and not necessarily small nations either as for example Brazil uses this technology.Also, there should be no such thing as voter registration; we're advanced enough(or should be) that any citizen should be able to vote nearly anywhere and have the appropriate ballot pulled up as well their eligibility already and/or immediately determined; many nations have eliminated what is now considered in many cases an arcane relic of a time when only handwritten paper ballots existed and machines weren't used for counting..you know like in the 1910s instead of the 21st century.I'd probably be willing to compromise with Republicans on this one; You need an ID to vote?  -Fine, then you don't need to register as this gets taken care of immediately when obtaining the ID.Next, the voting roll purges with no notification (often heavily biased towards African Americans), restrictions on the youth vote, absentee bureacracy(kids in college have a lot more work involved to vote), the fraudulent pamphlets, robocalls, threats of prosecutions or other crimes for voting(ex: Cleveland where I live there was one that if you weren't registered and voted you'd go to jail), "poll watchers" to publicly challenge and harass who they think are Democrats aka African Americans, voting resource/budgetary denials, and the like all that make voting in "urban" areas a gauntlet of fraud and then hours in line at the polling booth, cut and kept away as GOP traitors eliminate early and weekend voting too and then election day on Tuesday making the bias already overwhelming for retirees or people with more flexible "salary" jobs, but a lot more difficult for working people or "wage earners"..again its total BS in urban areas cause all this creates hours long lines in certain places understaffed, under-resourced, and often the rules of the game(ex: early eliminated) changed not in time for there not to be anything but chaos.  Florida, now more than a decade past the 2000 debacle, is still with worst with line waits reported in some precincts at over 8 hours!!!  8 Hours to vote!!!  -And our country's absolute failure(read willful neglect) to upgrade, modernize, and standardize voting technology is one of the shames of our nation; its a medieval mismatch menagerie of varying fiefdoms out there, with some "rich" areas the latest and greatest in touchscreen tech; and others still yanking on levers.Nice touch too billboards that post wrong voting dates and other misinformation campaigns in black/minority areas bought and paid for by GOP-aligned groups; and you wonder why black people HATE Republicans!  Ironically though as far as purges go, Asian people are by far the most removed from rolls as apparently most easy to identify them a lot more by last name; the Al-Jazeera expose revealed the most discriminated against surnames in purgings in Georgia were: Jackson, Garcia, Patel, and Kim.Keep in mind too there's already big disparities in wealth simply stemming from the fact that often poorer people are renters who tend to move yearly or many times, while those wealthier own homes and more established/grounded somewhere.  Also, those who've been to jail have their voting rights removed; an obscenity in itself in a country with 4% of the world's population, yet nearly 1 out of 4(aka 25%) of its people behind bars!  One could make the case in many ways these people are political prisoners..which actually they are as they've had their political rights stripped.Need any other examples or will your dissonance just manifest itself in ever more fervent denial?Oh, the other big one is the treasonous crime against democracy which is Gerrymandering!  Many countries have solved and made illegal by making the district drawing process non-political as well banning the legalized crimes that go unpunished here being that parties in power in the Statehouse draw up their own favorable maps and perpetuate their fraud and continued election; manifested in our case with black people being packed in such high percentages to districts they have much less representation than they otherwise would.  Democrats do this too though and its a crime against the People in our political system that has existed since our nation's founding; other country's have found ways to make voting fair and non-corrupt; why can't America?  Just for a stat, the Economist's Democracy Index ranks the US as 19th; not the top category of "Full Democracy" of which we're only now a couple of spots away from "Flawed Democracy" rank.  And a big part of this stems from how skewed our election process is relative to other nations.  Another stat?  -Our Congressional incumbency re-election rate is worse than it was in the Soviet Politburo and Chinese Congress; i.e. Communist countries.  Our approval rating of Congress too has been in single digits or low teens almost all this century; the King and Parliament were more popular during the American Revolution; as well it isn't Democracy when independent polls show generally 80 some percent of Chinese are happy with their government or country's direction while less than 20% of Americans think the same about theirs; that's not Democracy!</comment>

<comment>India has a Voter ID cardhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>And pretty problematic from what I've seen; again I don't mind Voter ID so much as long as easy to obtain and again then no reason for registration.</comment>

<comment>The Willie Horton Ads: It was Al Gore who asked Dukakis, in a debate right before the 1988 New York primary, about "weekend passes for convicted criminals." A group supporting Bush may have run with this but it was Al Gore who started the ball rolling.</comment>

<comment>No, it was Lee Atwater that got the ball rolling.  You should look him up. He was a really interesting character.  And by interesting I mean sorta evil."Critics ripped the ad for prominently featuring Horton’s mugshot and playing upon the fears of black crime.

GOP campaign strategist Lee Atwater said, “By the time we’re finished, they’re going to wonder whether Willie Horton is Dukakis’ running mate.”http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the...</comment>

<comment>As one Mr. Charles Barkley noted recently, "Black people have been voting for Democrats their whole life, and they’re still poor."Talk about voting against your own interests.</comment>

<comment>You are right, blacks should not vote for Democrats because Democrats won't help them.Blacks should vote for Democrats because Republicans are actively looking to hurt them even when it hurts republicans too.</comment>

<comment>Blacks compete for jobs very directly with immigrants both legal and illegal. There is a widely known animosity toward hispanics in the black community for that very reason. I would not be surprised if that factor alone prompted a significant black turnout for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Recent years?  The Willie Horton ad was twenty-five years ago, by next November that will be almost a decade before today's youngest voters were even born.Not to mention that there was nothing "hostile to blacks" about the Willie Horton ad.  It merely featured the case of a violent offender who had been furloughed and then committed another violent crime.  The offender happened to be black.It  seems rather racist to claim that all blacks should perceive discussion of one man's crime as hostility toward their race. Is each black person not an individual, most of whom have never committed any violent crime? Why should they care about Willie Horton?</comment>

<comment>A very well done piece, but in the near term I doubt we see any real deviation from the historical voting patterns of black America.  However, 10-15 years down the road I think things could be different because black voters will be supplanted by latinos as the minority group most essential to Democratic electoral success.  What will black voters do when they realize that they are no longer riding the the passenger seat of the Democratic party but have been relegated to the back seat for good?  What tactics will the Democrats have to resort to in order to keep this coalition together?  It's not going to be pretty.</comment>

<comment>Well, the platform of civil rights, voting rights, not going on stupid foreign adventures, reforming the economy so it benefits the many, not the few, should all be quite popular with both groups.</comment>

<comment>Once the Supreme Court strikes down Affirmative Action during its next term, there won't be anything for Democrats to pretend to offer them.It hasn't been really difficult to win the black vote for Democrats—just maintain welfare spending and pander to the egos of the black "elite," like Ta-Nehisi Coates, Oprah, Steve Harvey, and the other minstrels.</comment>

<comment>There does seem to be an interesting problem opening up for the republican party though: older, more affluent, more highly educated African Americans might want shop around when voting, but they are also more likely to be more liberal and less religious than the poorer, less highly educated African Americans- and thus more inclined to accept and even welcome gay marriage, for instance, or to accept the free trade means free trade argument, and less likely to accept the Donald Trump version of free trade. While they are more wealthy, many of them are wealthy because their parents moved into the middle class in union-jobs, after the unions left their racist ways and integrated in the 1960s and 1970s. Walker is not going to be that interesting a candidate for them, is he?  I could sort of see a Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio argument- if they drop the 'I'm not a scientist' act, but even there this going to be a tough sell. And Bush and Rubio are not doing well in the polls and may not be reflective of the party anyway. We'll have to wait and see what stupidity they will come up with to battle the Donald.In all, I would expect there to be an opening for the republican party, but only on the local or possibly state level, by running against police brutality in Ferguson for instance or on accountability and transparency in Baltimore or Chicago. Even then, an ability to work with and shift Democrats would be the only way to be successful IN office, which would mean such a figure could not be a member of the Republican party for very long.</comment>

<comment>In case you haven't noticed, the Republican Party owns the offices below the presidency nationwide from congress right on down to county sheriff. I'm certainly not stating this as a matter of pride - just fact. </comment>

<comment>Mm. Must have missed a mayoral election or two in the big cities then, Rahm, de Blassio. Sorry. I do try to keep up, but must have missed something.Furthermore, the question is not whether republicans could win races- of course they can, they wouldn't be much of a party if they couldn't- but whether they could win significant sections of the black voter block. My suggestion is that they could, for instance in Ferguson, by running on accountability, and transparency. Being out of government there, this type of outsider campaign could work-but it would be highly unpopular with the rest of the GOP, who think that by definition people in law enforcement can't do anything wrong, especially not to black people.</comment>

<comment>RahmSpit TakeRahm is exactly the kind of thing we're talking about. His campaigns and subsequent reign of terr...ible management are run as a vise between rich liberals who hate unions and poor black people who hate unions. The Republican governor Illinois has now (who happens to be a close personal friend of Rahm's and share a number of his political views) ran his campaign right out of Rahm's playbook. He managed to win or almost win the two richest wards in downtown Chicago and shave off a significant portion of the black vote.With friends like Rahm, who needs Republicans?</comment>

<comment>Well, I wouldn't worry about the new governor of Illinois. He'll turn out to be corrupt too: they all are, by definition.</comment>

<comment>"Turn out" is an understatement. If you hear somebody's a "venture capitalist" wanting to be a politician or a do-gooder, you immediately start flipping rocks looking for conflicts of interest.

<comment>Of course. Nothing is monolithic, but the preponderance of offices in most of the country have turned that way. Big cities are an exception as they are bastions of the left. That's why most are basket cases.But, to your main point, the Republicans have (wrongly in my opinion) written off the black vote due to the political equivalent of battered spouse syndrome displayed by the black electorate toward the Democrats.  </comment>

<comment>There is no such thing as free trade. We import what we want from where we want. Not an ounce more. Pretty much everything is from China because the elites decided that we needed to partner with China and import from there in exchange for exposing our brands to an up and coming billion person country, reducing costs and to counter the Soviets. American workers be damned. Same reason we import H1-b IT workers from India: Reducing costs and geopolitics. It seems whenever corporate cost reduction aligns with geopolitics the American worker will be screwed. The geopolitics is the icing of course.</comment>

Keep trying to distract black people from the critical jobs issue  with irrelevant side issues such as cop-bashing, race-baiting, gay marriage, etc.Fact:  Democrats  have been supportive of mass and illegal immigration for decades - a major factor together with free trade/offshoring which has killed unions and kept wages and working conditions lower since the end of the 1970s.The middle class has lost a large amount of wealth which has gone to the one-percenters.  Many African-American people ( and also white and Hispanic ) have wound up in prison because jobs which USED to be middle class in the 1970s no longer pay a living wage.To be fair, Bernie Sanders is actually not bad on this issue - but Trump is even better.Bernie is hemmed in by the racial-grievance fringe of the left-wing, but Trump is beholden to nobody, and will have a better chance of getting tough things done.</comment>

<comment>So black people will vote for a wall being put between the US and Canada?http://www.news.com.au/finance...Right, cause they have no memory.</comment>

<comment>Again, I repeat, just look at Trumps' website.  All proposals are directly beneficial to African-Americans.https://www.donaldjtrump.com/p...</comment>

<comment>Well, sort off. I'm not convinced that stopping the influx of foreign workers on H1 visas isn't going to massively slow down the American high-tech economy, and/or export jobs to India, either by outsourcing or by competition. But I'm sure Trump has an answer for that too: I'll just make foreign competion illegal because it is 'unfair', or 'un-American' or '...something'</comment>

<comment>"...I'm not convinced that stopping the influx of foreign workers on H1 visas isn't going to massively slow down the American high-tech economy...".You have absolutely no evidence for this strange belief- it's like saying that getting rid of Santa Claus might slow down the US high-tech economy.You also seem unaware that the US economy was protectionist before the late 1970s, and was a world leader in manufacturing back then.  The one-percenters sold the public a fake bill of goods, telling them that a massive financial sector would be an adequate replacement - the "future" or "progress".Instead, all we got were bailouts, more national debt, structural unemployment and a small number of fabulously wealthy WHITE people.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I'm sure the world was wonderful when Nixon ran it. The point is that you cannot go back to that world: more Indians, and Chinese and Japanese and Koreans and ...are highly educated now. The brilliant thing Jobs did was pull the talented people into Apple, so that these people are now turning a profit for the US. Without that the competition from these places would be much more problematic, and already Samsung (Samsung! remember the Samsung from the 1970s?) is giving them a run for their money. The rest of the world is not as interested in propping up the US economy, as the cold war incentive, and US largesse that came with it, is goneTrump can't make America great again, even if that is what it says on the package.</comment>

<comment>Your whole post is pointless.1) Apple cheerleading?  WTF.? Most Apple jobs are outsourced overseas.  The profits go to a handful of one-percenters. Is that your point? Cheerleading for one-percenters?2)"...The rest of the world is not as interested in propping up the US economy...".Actually, that's false.  The Chinese buy 7% of Treasury debt, for example.  The US dollar is also still used for international trade, heavily.3) "...Trump can't make America great again...".  You can say it - but you have nothing to back up empty words.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...except that Trump is an opportunistic Charlatan fraud; I love the guy as he's trolling the GOP harder than the Black Knight guarding the bridge in Monty Python but pretty hilarious as the guy's pro-choice, not really a Christian, or even more than a wealthy tycoon New England Republican; but d*mn does his lip service good!As far as your "Facts", the Dems haven't been a truly liberal party since the 1960s; we're living in Ronald Reagan's Revolution still and still stuck in the same political age; this may be changing though but otherwise the Dems are a best a triangulated neoliberal aka classic liberal Republican mess.Also, immigration whether legal or illegal or both combined still isn't to the levels it was in more prosperous times in our history; we've had veritable floods before yet America little worse for wear.  Ironically though the situation's pretty much stabilized itself as the economy gone south and Mexicos, Central Americas' improved we've actually had some net negative migration with more people leaving the US than coming in.  Pretty much a shocker as perhaps the first time in our history.</comment>

<comment>You seem pretty smug and pretty convinced that you are clever- yet you have no ideas and you don't take a stand on anything.You have nothing except pointless name-calling.</comment>

<comment>And obviously you have no evidence to base this on so you resort to the same as you accuse me.</comment>

<comment>I am not going to post thousands of lines to prove my point. Just read Philip Cafaro's book "How Many is Too Many" which gives the progressive critique of mass immigration.  It corrects your misconceptions.http://www.press.uchicago.edu/...</comment>

<comment>I have faith the black community will continue to vote for failure.</comment>

<comment>If you think we are stupid enough to vote for a political party (Republicans) who might as well be the Klan without hoods - I have a bridge to sell you.</comment>

<comment>It's funny how many arguments there are here for "bootstrap" individual responsibility, then Republicans complaining that blacks vote for failure.Either you believe in individual responsibility & how one votes doesn't matter or you believe that voting and gov't policies affects economic status. Chastising black people from all angles is a favorite hobby in Americana.Conservatives also don't seem to care about black wages & employment until they need to get rid of Hispanics. The immigrant thing is problematic, but conservatives seem pretty content to let big business abuse it.Keep the alliance strong, we finally pulled America into the modern age with near universal healthcare, elected a black president, and kept us out of war with Iran.</comment>

<comment>What the fook would I do with a bridge?</comment>

<comment>The Democratic Party has three major, loyal blocs who also kind of hate each other:-The racialized underclass - mostly black* but also American Indians-The pro-union working class - mostly ethnic whites and Latinos-The cosmopolitan "gentry liberal" classUnlike any Republican demographic, each of these broadly agrees with the Republican Party on at least one major issue, and can and has defected to them on occasion. The national Republicans are getting a lot of money and mileage out of being antagonistic to all of them, but serious state Republicans in the Northeast and Midwest have been figuring out how to peel off one group or another. It's only a matter of time until they figure out how to blow up the Democratic Party for good.*I'm including the black working/lower middle class here because its existence can be more precarious and because they get treated like part of the underclass</comment>

<comment>he Republican Party has three major, loyal blocs who also kind of hate each other:-The racialized underclass - mostly southern white but also  some other asian groups-The anti-union working class - mostly Scott Walker whites and Latinos-The cosmopolitan "gentry conservative " classUnlike any Democratic demographic, each of these broadly agrees with the Democratic Party on at least one major issue, and can and has defected to them on occasion.There, fixed that for you.</comment>

<comment>In North Carolina only 1 and 3 exist, and they form the basis of the Democratic Party. There is relatively no union activity in NC, like most of the South.  Hispanic voters can vote Republican, but tend to vote Democratic because of the GOP's anti-immigrant rhetoric; thus I'd include them in your #1.Urban blacks in Durham, Charlotte, and elsewhere can be socially liberal.  But rural blacks tend to be as religiously conservative as their white neighbors.  This makes them socially quite different from white progressives in the triangle.  But they still overwhelmingly vote Democrat in NC and I don't see that changing anytime soon.  The Republican leadership in NC has gone out of its way to slash public education and the kinds of social mobility programs that the majority of African Americans support.But, as the Tillis-Hagan Senate race showed, Democrats cannot win in NC merely by turning out #1 and #3.  The only way they can win at the present is if they can figure out how to get a few more blue collar whites to return to the Democratic tent.</comment>

<comment>The pro-union working class now consists almost entirely of government workers.</comment>

<comment>They still haven't learned who(democraps) it is that's holding them back and have been for decades</comment>

<comment>How are the Democrats holding them back?</comment>

<comment>Support for illegal/mass immigration, support for free trade/offshore outsourcing, support for moving wealth to the one-percenters ( Wall Street deregulation, etc.)</comment>

<comment>Trickle up is driven by the tax policies of the right. The left does not support illegal immigration. They just haven't heard a humane and affordable method of halting it other than to make employers accountable for hiring only legal workers, and the right opposes that.</comment>

<comment>" The left does not support illegal immigration."Another rube self-identifies. Who is pushing the sanctuary cities? Who is refusing to enforce federal immigration law? Who pulled the Border Patrol 40 miles inland to accept hundreds of thousands of Central American "minors"?Get a clue.</comment>

<comment>"...The left does not support illegal immigration...".B*llsh*t. Don't piss on my leg and tell me it's raining. The left is 1000% in favor of illegal immigration - with the possible exception of Bernie Sanders- but even he seems to oppose deporting illegals.The proof is SIMPLE. Read my lips : 'SANCTUARY CITIES'.Every single lefty mayor, from NY mayor DiBlasio to whoever is mayor of San Francisco - 31 cities -  ALL PROGRESSIVE.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>http://www.surveyusa.com/clien...In 2016, America will elect a President.  If the election for President of the United States were today, and the only two names on the ballot were Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, who would you vote for? Trump wins vs Hill, 45 to 40%Voter breakdownWhite 51% (Hill 34%)Black 25% (Hill 59%)Hispanic 31% (Hill 50%)Asian 41% (Hill 39%)That's far better than what Mittens did with Minorities in 2012</comment>

<comment>Polls this far out are meaningless. I seem to recall that many people, and certainly Mittens himself had polls that showed him beating Obama.</comment>

<comment>Amazing the results you get when you oversample Republican households by 7 percent</comment>

<comment>And base most of your polling on landlines, which disproportionately biases the results towards older white people.</comment>

<comment>Around 60% percent of households have landlines according to the Chicago Tribune.</comment>

<comment>60 percent, OK, so 40 percent don't.  Which way do you think the demographic breakdown goes?Like if I were to say...Pick a random 20 something asian male and a 65+ white couple, who's more likely to have a land line?This isn't even up for argument, that is why the Romney team thought they were winning in the run up to 2012. They did not account for these demographic shifts...setting aside how badly their info operation was overall...they chose to believe in flawed methodology.This isn't speculation.  It happened.</comment>

<comment>Romney was a RINO and not the candidate we wanted, that's why we lost.</comment>

<comment>That's simply not true.  Every single one of the candidates that was in the primaries back in 2011 had a harder line stance than Romney and they couldn't sell it to the delegates that pick the nominee for the general election.You had guys like Santorum up there...who wears all of his regressive stances on his sleeve with absolutely no apologies.  If the strategy said that he'd have the greatest chance to win in the general, then the delegation would have picked him because nobody is willingly in the game to lose.They didn't choose him though because they understood that his viewpoints were not salable in the general election where built in bases can be counted on to show up and the real fight is over that 7-11 percent cohort in the center.That 7 to 11 percent are not people that are going to be swayed by the typical hardcore views in one direction or another.  You cannot capture those people by stumping and throwing red meat to the base.  Election politics simply does not work in that way.You, like many others on the far right of the spectrum, are resistant to admitting that the wrong temperature of the country was taken.  That incorrect temperature reading was then utilized for strategy...and it lost the election.</comment>

<comment>We all know about Republicans and polling</comment>

<comment>surveyusa isn't Karl Rove's bunch, and was far closer than Gallup or Rasmussen in 2012</comment>

<comment>I'm not calling the poll into question, though I suspect it's an outlier. I'm making a joke based on how Republicans interpret polls.</comment>

<comment>True, though they were deluding themselves, given how far they oversample Team R households, like Gallup and Rasmussen did</comment>

<comment>"While data shows that in 2012, black turnout increased overall, so did black support for the Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney"Support that statement.  What does that mean?  Support increased for Romney compared to previous times when Romney ran?  Compared to other GOP candidates?  How much did support increase?  What did polling reveal about support for Romney?  Was it from younger or older voters?  The article seems unclear.  Older voters seem to be correlated with the older idea of "linked fate" but support for Romney occurred at a time when participation by young black voters decreased, so that doesn't seem to make sense.The entire article seems premised on this single data point being significant, but doesn't even go into any detail about this data point.   There's a conclusion, a reference to some data, no explanation of that data and limited efforts to even link to or reference that data, and a lot of what seems to be wishful thinking.</comment>

<comment>because it means that the black vote is not being suppressed, when black turnout is increased overall.</comment>

<comment>Interesting piece.  The best medical advice suggests not holding your breath while waiting for the republican party to campaign on issues that the African American community feel is in their interest.  And if they did find an appealing candidate within the party, ironically they might not be able to act, due to policies pushed by republicans at state and local level that restrict the vote.</comment>

<comment>"waiting for the republican party to campaign on issues that the African American community feel is in their interest."Like...immigration? Like...jobs?meanwhile, what does the DNC campaign on "in their interest"? Welfare?</comment>

<comment>(snicker)</comment>

<comment>Enlighten me.  What is the party position on immigration that you think would sell well with African Americans ?Also, you'll need to clarify 'jobs', on its own it is not a party position, and certainly not a strength for republicans.</comment>

<comment>Democrats score no points with black voters, but Republicans score plenty of own-goals.</comment>

<comment>Black voters are now in the cat bird seat!  You want their votes, you've got to bring something to the table!</comment>

<comment>Yes and you are a clown</comment>

<comment>Worse than a clown, actually. They're a troll.</comment>

<comment>Blacks and Hispanics are at each others' throats in California, over control of the narcotics trade and over unskilled legitimate jobs. And blacks look at Asians as easy targets for street crimes. And blacks aren't exactly happy to see yet another new group working their way up while blacks can't seem to get it together.</comment>

<comment>So street criminals are representative of black people in general? Wow that's really racist</comment>

<comment>In Philadelphia and Baltimore, the majority of black males are under supervision on account of their crimes.</comment>

<comment>This is what happens to these people who spend all their time in racist echo chambers- they start believing the people they are talking to represent anything other than some crazy fringe</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you are. Drawing conclusions from that is not a bright idea </comment>

<comment>They all exhibit a complete and total failure to listen to what people who aren't conservatives actually say, rather than what Fox News says they say.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, this is key- why not ask around? Try some other sources?  I don't get it.  Even if I find it unpleasant, I'll read some conservative writers every now and the if only to understand what they're up to.</comment>
