<comment>Cruz is a blatantly overt Grade A a**hole.  If people were willing to vote for him despite that, the fact that he is a self-centered lover of mammon (but I repeat myself) is not going to change their minds.</comment>

<comment>A Republican who doesn't practice what he preaches.  Who woulda thunk?</comment>

<comment>Daddy best.</comment>

<comment>How fortunate Democrats are saved from such charges by having no standards at all. Does Hillary Clinton tithe? Of course not, she lives off a "charity" to which foreign potentates and arms dealers contribute millions in the hopes of buying influence with a future President.</comment>

<comment>Hey--lets talk about Senator Crud who Lied on his finance report, claimed he "forgot" a one million dollar loan, and gives zero for Charity, a Real GOP Christian.</comment>

<comment>This again is misinformation in a NYT baloney sandwich. The amount of the loan was reported fully on one form and the redundant other form(both were publicly available)left without entry. It was a $500,000 loan. it was perfectly legal and that is why the story has no legs in the media.</comment>

<comment>Deflection at work!!!</comment>

<comment>We don't know what he's giving if he's truly following God's Word. Christ tells us to keep our giving secret.</comment>

<comment>right  (sn)--he gives more but it does not appear on his tax returns</comment>

<comment>How would anyone know what he gives unless he says so?</comment>

<comment>If he's truly following Christ's command, he won't say so. That's God's Word. Maybe he decided to follow it.</comment>

<comment>Given that's true--no one then, can state with any confidence that he gives 0%, 10%, or even 100%. Speculating that he "gives" is speculation, not based upon any facts.</comment>

<comment>No one needs to know what he's given. That's between him and God.</comment>

<comment>Right - no one can know if he doesn't tell. Any statement saying "I know he gives more" or "I know he tithes" is speculation and unfactual.</comment>

<comment>That is correct. Aren't you a Genius for being Captain Obvious!!</comment>

<comment>Obvious as well, thanks!</comment>

<comment>If he's truly giving the way Christ tells us to give, it won't show up on his tax return. If he's giving the way man tells us to give, it will.</comment>

<comment>you sheep will justify anything and you will vote for a fraud... go for it, but he is a liar and a fraud... and he is no Christian.</comment>

<comment>Man, we need to leave this stupid !@#$ in the Stone Age.</comment>

<comment>Would be difficult amigo, considering no popular religion today is a stone age religion. The closest you would get is Hinduism and Buddhism which are Bronze Age, the rest are all Iron Age.</comment>

<comment>*shrugs*You know what I meant.</comment>

<comment>The pedant in me thoroughly enjoyed your response.</comment>

<comment>The religions themselves may be bronze or iron age but a lot of the beliefs and practices have been recycled from prior religions.  Not sure how far tithing goes back but it wouldn't surprise me if the ancient Egyptians came up with the practice.</comment>

<comment>They did.  Osiris, the final judge of the gods,  granted resurrection and eternal life to those whose hearts weighed on his scale showed goodness and compassion. They also spoke of the ka (soul) and believed animals had ka too.  The money for the death rituals (mummification) went to the temple priests. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</comment>

<comment>For the sake of pedanting a pedant, Judaism and Zoroastrianism are both bronze age religions as well.</comment>

<comment>Judaism was a state religion quite different from the stateless one it became during / after the Roman Civil War. It can be argued that the rabbis of the age invented something quite new and distinct, like their contentious contemporary Jesus did with the gentiles.</comment>

<comment>Rabbi Yohanon ben Zakkai and the other rabbis of Yavneh, who reestablished the Sanhedrin and reconstructed Judaism after the destruction of the Temple, were not founding a new religion but allowing for the continuation of an old religion under altered circumstances. The Judaism of the Pharisees, which had been only one sect of Judaism before, became rabbinic Judaism.</comment>

<comment>Good on you amigo. I was wrong about Judaism.</comment>

<comment>Gonna look that up.  The eras of the ages.That's interesting....a little smug but it is friday....lol.</comment>

<comment>In fairness, the Bronze Age.</comment>

<comment>So, kind of like a limousine liberal?</comment>

<comment>A limousine liberal stands for higher taxes to pay for government programs to help the poor, so that they don't have to donate, because a functioning advanced society shouldn't have to rely on charity for a reasonable safety net.  An appropriate analogy would be a limousine liberal who cheats on their taxes or lobbies for tax breaks to benefit them.</comment>

<comment>Like John Kerry with his yacht?</comment>

<comment>Is a rich person who buys a yacht cheating on his taxes?Edited to add; Kerry's wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, is extremely rich in her own right. But your trolling and SQUIRREL moment is noted.</comment>

<comment>And now you know the rest of the story.</comment>

<comment>Total outrage that John Kerry would want his sailboat in The Ocean State, home to the most famous sailing port in North America...  And Rhode Island is far more cash-strapped than Massachusetts, for that matter.</comment>

<comment>So you are OK with him being a tax cheat ... got it and good to know.</comment>

<comment>So, by virtue of paying a CPA and/or Tax Attorney who advises you that you can save $500k in taxes on a luxury yacht by lawfully docking it in another state, is considered cheating? And does this definition extend to ALL people/politicians, or just the ones you don't like?</comment>

<comment>That's not cheating.  Its just choosing where to put the yacht based on taxes.  Many people take taxes into account when deciding where to live, shop, or work.  If Kerry registered the yacht in RI but then covertly docked it in MA all year then that would be cheating.  But I don't doubt the guy actually docks it in RI.  Its not that far of a drive.  What I'm surprised about is that MA hasn't come up with some rubbish "use" tax equivalent for residents with out of state yachts.  Make them pay the higher of the two rates just as they do with sales and income taxes.</comment>

<comment>As other posters have noted, keeping your boat in a different state than your residence is not being a tax cheat.  It is, to be perfectly honest, a lot more anodyne than most of the machinations Mitt Romney engaged in to lower his taxes before, during, and after he was governor of Massachusetts.Or do you believe that every boat and yacht in Florida belongs to a Floridian?</comment>

<comment>In her own right?  She got every dime from her father.  That is not in her own efforts or skills or morality.  Just like Trump and the Kochs etc., zeroes to heroes because of Dad's allowance and inheritance.  No one who inherits their fortune should show their face in politics. They are children forever and that is the burden they carry.</comment>

<comment>Nope, you're just showing your ignorance.Teresa married Sen. John Heinz, a descendant of the Heinz food empire. He died in the mid 1990s with Teresa inheriting most of his fortune. She later married John Kerry whom she knew from her husband's Senate time.Teresa Heinz Kerry has used her fortune to further her charitable works and has little interest in politics. She owns the yacht.</comment>

<comment>She was actually fairly wealthy even before she married Heinz. Her family lived in Mozambique when it was still a Portuguese colony and got rich expropriating local land and natural resources.</comment>

<comment>Compared to what she inherited when her husband died, her family was comfortable.</comment>

<comment>I think his point might have been that Kerry himself doesn't actually come from very much money. His family is very elite/prestigious and was wealthy several generations ago, but he grew up in a middle-to-upper-middle-class family.He didn't gain access to the sort of super-rich lifestyle he lives now until he married Teresa Heinz.</comment>

<comment>It's his wifes ...lol.  Kerry is just an idiot who married well.</comment>

<comment>We(men) should all be so lucky.</comment>

<comment>I gave up land early in my youth due to fear of marriage and in my early 30's passed on what turned out to be a very successful lawyer.  I do not regret either decision unless it's deer season....lol.</comment>

<comment>I'm 100% fine with John Kerry being crazy rich, as long as he pays his taxes and doesn't promote legislation that lowers his (or his wife's taxes).In fact, I hope he and his wife get even richer and buy 20 more yachts...and continue to pay their taxes.  I hope the same for the Koch brothers and Trump too.</comment>

<comment>" I hope the same for the Koch brothers..."That's going too far!</comment>

<comment>If we following God's Word, no one but God will know how much we give.</comment>

<comment>If they factor in his tithing to goldman sachs, he'll meet the threshold.</comment>

<comment>This is stretching it. The religious right in this country may pay lip service to charity, and claim in a poll that it's important to them, but the reason they're even considering a man like Ted Cruz has nothing to do with godliness and everything to do with how effectively he fans the flames of their tribal hatreds. They don't care about his tithing.</comment>

<comment>Ding Ding Ding! We have a winner...</comment>

<comment>Just like they don't care about divorce but are up in arms about marriage equality.</comment>

<comment>I care about both. I detest it when someone plays the faith card and doesn't practice biblical generosity. And I detest it when someone plays the marriage card but has not been faithful to their vows. And there are millions of people like me who DO look to see one's actions and words align and we won't vote for you if they don't. You're suggesting that people like me just don't exist. I suggest you get out more.</comment>

<comment>That is an admirable consistency on your part.  But the loudest evangelical voices one hears nowadays have little to say about the divorce laws.</comment>

<comment>I agree with your point about what actually drives Cruz's appeal: anger, victim-hood, nostalgia for an imagined better time, hatred of urban elites, etc.But I also wouldn't underestimate the potential impact of this.  Just as parishioners hold their preacher to a higher standard than they hold themselves, Evangelical voters will expect a candidate running on Christian values to walk the walk.  Otherwise they will be left feeling used and taken advantage of.</comment>

<comment>You nailed it. The hypocrisy is that Cruz and his followers will strip away the social safety net under the lie that the faith-based community will step in. Nice to see this exposed.</comment>

<comment>A religious view injected into politics. Meanwhile, those same people whitewash Muslims as terrorists.  The entire evangelical movement makes me wretch.</comment>

<comment>Non issue is a non issue.</comment>

<comment>Live by the sword, die by the sword.</comment>

<comment>I'm shocked, SHOCKED, to learn that an Evangelical Christian Teapublican doesn't practice what he preaches.</comment>

<comment>If he's practicing what the Bible says, his giving is between him and God alone. No one knows what true Christians give. They don't let others know.</comment>

<comment>But he isn't shy about "practicing his piety" in front of everyone.  Live by the sword, die by the sword.</comment>

<comment>Many Christians believe it? How many do it? I know most Catholics don't, unless we come into a lump sum of money all at once.</comment>

<comment>I grew up Catholic and didn't know what "tithe" meant until I went to a Protestant church.</comment>

<comment>The concept of "tithe" indeed is mostly among evangelical and protestant to earn money. Sadly, that's how we see how they have lavish mega-churches, even to the extent of wishing private jets.The way they run their church is rather like a multi-level marketing network scheme, selling the product of "salvation". The more people they recruit, the more income the organization earn. That's why the "great commission" is very important to them than anything else.Money is indeed the root of all evil.</comment>

<comment>It depends on the church. I have seen churches run efficiently and donating tons to causes, while maintaining a large congregation. I have also heard stories about churches that seemed more after money than anything. They are not all the same.</comment>

<comment>It's as what kmhihindu pointed out, it's rather for the love of money that started to make those churches sway away.</comment>

<comment>Money is NOT the root of all evil.  LOVE of money is the root of all evil. 1 Timothy 6:10</comment>

<comment>Yes, indeed :)</comment>

<comment>Didn't Christ throw the moneychangers out of the temple?!</comment>

<comment>and what's your point ?</comment>

<comment>Evangelicals vote for s party that gives tax cuts to the rich and cut foodstamps for the poor.</comment>

<comment>That was prior to his posthumous multi-national branding campaign. He has evolved post-resurrection.There needs to be written, a third testament, that chronicles  Jesus' power hungry war mongering since the middle ages. </comment>

<comment>My Catholic parents wrote a check every Sunday to the church. They encouraged us to give whatever we had as well. I always thought that was a good thing until college came and I had to finance the whole thing. </comment>

<comment>I thought it was a good thing until I realized much of that money was going to settle child molestation lawsuits.</comment>

<comment>Oh yeah, there's that too. I also remember the alter boys rolling out two big screen TVs one service to deliver a taped address from the arch diocese. Ironically they were asking for more money for something. I don't remember because I was so amazed, I had never seen a big screen tv before. We certainly didn't have one. </comment>

<comment>Plenty of Christians tithe. Plenty believe in it but can't bring themselves to give that much. I'm not one to judge. I think this will change a some opinions, but will not be a huge impact. Technically, "carpet bombing" civilians should be a bigger impact on a Christian's conscience than tithing, but not to the "Christian Right". The cheers for Trump at Liberty show that Christians are not one huge political faction that only follows the Bible. I hate the way that Republicans try to hijack religion for their own political use.With Cruz and Trump as front runners, I have to ask who is putting these ads out there? Trump? Would a careful review of his finances show him to be quite charitable? A quick google search shows that his charitable giving is quite small compared to his wealth.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. Came exactly here to say this.</comment>

<comment>Honestly. If you're going to go after anyone, go after Trump.  He's much more wealthy than Cruz and is clearly pandering to evangelicals.  Cruz may or may not be exaggerating the extent of his faith, but it's abundantly clear that Trump has none.</comment>

<comment>We don't know and it is none of our business what faith Trump follows.  He wants the evangelical votes but doesn't falsely say he is one.  That's why he accepted Palin's endorsement - the gullible evangelical vote.</comment>

<comment>Actually, he does falsely claim that he is one.  He did it just recently and tried painfully to pander to evangelicals all the while making it clear that he's rarely if ever cracked open a Bible and doesn't understand Christian theology at all.  It's very clear that Trump follows something or someone, but it's not Christ.</comment>

<comment>As an Evangelical Christian, I am a bit saddened by this.  Tithing is not only a way to give to others who are less fortunate, but it is also a way to show trust in God to provide.  You don't necessarily have to tithe to be president, but if you claim to be a devout Christian, I would hope this is something you practice.</comment>

<comment>Beware those who speak the truth but don't practice it. </comment>

<comment>I am always wary of politicians, especially when they claim Christianity.  I can't really judge if someone is really a Christian, but I can pay attention to their actions and their words and see if they line up with Biblical teaching.</comment>

<comment>I think C.S. Lewis said that we can't judge other's faith because only God knows where they began and what they have or haven't done with what they were given in life.  We can only judge actions and point out if actions are in line with Christian teaching or not.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  And I thought I read the returns were from 2006-2010, so if Ted were to fess up about not tithing for that period, talk about growth in his faith over those years, and show an increase if faithfulness in his finances, I would hear that with an open and forgiving heart.</comment>

<comment>Smart point by both of you.  And I have always said If there is a God, he certainly is unequal in the potential and then the quality of life he bestows on each person. What's up with that?It appears almost random  .... hmmm.</comment>

<comment>Realistically, wouldn't you prefer a person who is capable of running the most powerful country in the world rather than one who throws up his hands and prays for the best? Jimmy Carter was good at praying but a lousy president.</comment>

<comment>I don't think those are mutually exclusive, but yes I prefer someone who will do a good job running our country.  The most Christan candidate will not necessarily get my vote. However, running on a Christian platform and not living out your faith will knock you down a few pegs in my view.  That's what I think is in question in this case.</comment>

<comment>Do you declare your tithing on your taxes though?  If you are not supposed to give to get accolades, nor let others know of your giving, doesn't declaring how much you gave on your taxes violate this?  The justification I could see for declaring it would be if you then took the decrease in taxes owed due to giving and used that for charity as well.</comment>

<comment>Personally, I declare my tithe on my taxes, but nobody looks at my taxes...so I get no accolades.  I think the accolades thing is about not bragging about your giving.  Calling tax exemptions bragging is kind of a stretch to me.</comment>

<comment>This seems reasonable. If, as the article states, he gives less than 1% to charity, he's at least itemizing some charitable deductions. Why declare a few and not all?</comment>

<comment>I'm not there yet. I don't think I'm even at half tithe yet. And I'm giving to my 401k first. I don't think this is an uncommon state of affairs for Christians. Money is hard. It's one reason Christ focused on it, more than sex certainly. There's a dozen ways sex out of bounds can lead you to grace the long way around. There's just too much potential for sacrificial love and self-forgetfulness in sex for it to be a stronghold of the darker forces. Money, and possessions, and insecurity about both, can really trip you up, though.</comment>

<comment>I am not at a full tithe either, and for a while I didn't tithe anything even though I was given a good job out of college.  I think it's easy to beat ourselves up about money, but I also believe the tithe is meant to help free us from trying to get as much stuff as we can.  When you give money away, there are some things you can't afford anymore.  Then you have to ask yourself if the things you gave up are important.  Often they are not.</comment>

<comment>I know I need to be better about giving the first fruits to God.  I was very humbled when talking to a woman who immediately gave 10% of her unemployment check to charity and continued to do this during the year it took her to find another job. (This was many years ago before the current caps on unemployment.)</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I don't think I've ever met anyone or even heard of anyone who regretted tithing, even in tough circumstances.  There are a lot of inspirational people out there who have really cool stories of tithing.</comment>

<comment>If if you're not religious (and I am not although I admire the teachings of Christ), a purely utilitarian moral argument supports it as well.</comment>

<comment>We all talk about what we would give away if we won the lottery, and I believe we would do it.  There's an aspect of wealth and high income that is played in this article.  In effect, the income that the Cruzes enjoy is akin to that, where they've been very successful in life, are millionaires with a Goldman Sachs income, and yet still don't donate to charity.  It's a little unsettling, if not outright parsimonious.</comment>

<comment>"I like your Christ. I do not like your Christians. Your Christians are so unlike your Christ. The materialism of affluent Christian countries appears to contradict the claims of Jesus Christ that says it's not possible to worship both Mammon and God at the same time."  Mahatma Ghandi</comment>

<comment>I'm not trying to be a douchebag here, but who do you give your money to?  A homeless guy (or woman) or your church?  If you give it directly to your church, do you know what the money goes to supporting?  The cynic in me believes that the church pushes tithing as a way to support the church, not to do works of charity.</comment>

<comment>No, that's a good question.  The short answer is tithing supports the church, but the church should support the community in meeting both physical and spiritual needs.I give most of my charitable contributions to our church and a smaller amount to a couple of charities that are more specific (Compassion International and Living Water).  I think there are lots of cases where money collected by churches has just gone to the leaders of the church getting nice things, which is despicable and one of the things Jesus came down really hard on during his time on earth.  I am fairly involved in our church, so when some of the money goes towards the pastors salary, I feel good about it because I see the impact they have in our community and am glad to support them.  I also know our church supports a lot of ministries including homeless shelters, adoption agencies, and so forth.</comment>

<comment>Ever wonder why people who support the confederate flag and members of the KKK have been voting for the Republicans for the past 20 years or so rather than the Democrats, despite knowing the often heard statement that the "Democrat is the political party that created the KKK" ? And all those people are conservatives, living mostly in the southern states, in addition to being racists, white supremacists, they are also very religious, homophobic, anti-abortionists.What most people don't know is that the Southern Democrats were the real party that created the KKK, and were known as the Dixiecrats. Back then in 1960's, Democratic President JFK was the one who released MLK out of compassion of what he was fighting for, to finally bring the Civil Right Act in 1964. Those Southern Democrats felt betrayed by their own member as President, and since then some have moved out to join the Republicans who took advantage of the situation to reel in those people, like Strom Thurmond who represented South Carolina in the Senate from 1954 until 2003, at first as a Democrat and after 1964 he switched to Republican. Not all Southern Democrats switched to Republicans, just like the Governor of Alabama George Wallace who stayed and tried to cling on to that party hoping it would come back to what it stood before.Google the Solid South to learn and see how the southern states were all blue prior to the Civil right act of 1964 to then turn red as Republicans supporters. Conservatives supporting the Republicans today, are all supporting those Southern Democrats, which is why we see such ideologies still in that party to be racists, anti-Obama, anti-black, anti-gay, deeply religious.Islamophobes, homophobes, racists, white supremacists, confederate flag, GOP & Republicans from 1964 onwards till today, conservatives, kkkhristians, kay kay kay, Southern Democrats prior to 1964, Dixiecrats, they all are peas from the same pod.Democrat prior to 1964 (Southern Democrats,Dixiecrats) = Republican from 1964 till today.In this presidential race, the less religious but racist conservatives seem to be following and supporting Donald Trump, while the very religious ones are mostly leaning towards Cruz and the other candidates that are trying so hard to label themselves as "Christians" aka kkkhristians.</comment>

<comment>Wow!Hyperbole and Straw men from a Lefty?Who'd a thunk it. ;)</comment>

<comment>If you eyes weren't closed, you wouldn't be blind!</comment>

<comment>Sorry, but since I'm not a believer I'm not really impressed with whatever paraphrase of the big sky mans sayings you wish to invoke.</comment>

<comment>Yes I know you are not Christian as a Follower of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm. It's the characteristic and profile indeed of people like you who are conservatives and support the Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Judge not lest yea be judged.I'd came by my non-belief honestly. For a person that is so fond of envoking "him" you seem to be cherry picking your verses and approach. </comment>

<comment>Did I judge you as what homophobes do rather to pass condemnation of discrimination laws to physically harm you ?I'm invoking Him to expose of who conservatives and the Republicans really are in respect to what He preached.</comment>

<comment>Which is "his" job and place to both judge and repay, not yours.Let he who is without sin cast the first stone......unless you are claiming to be sinless then I would withhold your stones.You can't envoke "him" on one issue then pretend "his" rules don't apply elsewhere.Makes you EXACTLY like the other hypocrits you claim to decry.</comment>

<comment>hmm you are trying to play the victim card as if like you who legislate and pass man-made discrimination laws unto gays to physically harm them, I'm "judging" you as what you do rather to cast stone unto gays who you judge WRONGLY.Actions speak louder than words. That's why again you fail to see the evil actions of your Republican party as what the Southern Democrats did, to be racist.</comment>

<comment>Nope just pointing out your hypocrisy on the issue.You are judging--mis-judgung actually, "conservatives and republcians"That is quite specfically "his" job to do so and quite specfically not yours.You have repeatedly invoked "his" will and word. And repeatedly  refused to follow it yourself.Which makes you a rank hypocrite.And BTW why I am no-longer a believer.People being so quick to invoke "his" word on others. So very unwilling to follow them themselves.</comment>

<comment>There is a huge difference between judging in passing ACTIONS of condemnation and exposing the truth in words !Again, you are confused as before for not knowing the difference between Southern Democrats and current Democrats. It's not a surprise to me that you got everything upside down.</comment>

<comment>Why would you judge Jesus by the sins of humanity or think that Jesus in ANY way indicated that following him would create a sinless utopia? He pretty much said just the opposite and showed just how much the world hated him despite preaching love.I can see not going to a particular church or even any church if you think they are largely hypocritical in how they live their faith. But to stop "believing" makes no sense at all. I think your understanding of the NT Bible might need some overhaul as well and I say that to you because you didn't hesitate to quote whatever parts worked to make your points. You are being hypocritical yourself by proof-texting only certain parts and ignoring the rest.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure I get the "sinless utopia" thing, I'm not suggesting that other people NOT believe. Just that I don't.Nope, as I'm not a believer I can't be a hypocrite on the issue.I'm free to quote Scripture back to someone that claims to be following it to demonstrate THEIR hypocrisy.In short, I can't be a hypocrite about a doctrine I don't follow while they certainly can be--if they are actual believers and followers.Happy to discuss whatever you feel I'm lacking in my understanding of the New Covenant.And BTW "proof texting only certain parts and ignoring the rest" is EXACTLY the point I already made. Welcome to the party.The beer is a little flat and the chips are soggy but better late than never.</comment>

<comment>Your comments imply you were once a believer and now you aren't and christian hypocrisy in regard to the teachings seems to have a lot to do with it. That doesn't make sense to me - to throw belief in Jesus out with the hypocritical church bathwater. He told us not to expect things to be easy, including a sinless church all marching together in kumbaya lockstep. Seems like it ought to make one more of a believer in Jesus.</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure that were I privy to any given  choices you make I could say the same thing.That it makes no sense.As it turns out however my choices don't have to make sense to anybody but me. And yours don't; have to make sense to anybody but you. </comment>

<comment>I didn't expect you to be able to explain. I have encountered the same reason given for loss of faith numerous times and have yet to hear anyone explain it in a logical way.</comment>

<comment>What would you accept as "logical?"Nor is anyone saying its the only reason--at least speaking for me.</comment>

<comment>When the Democrats passed the Voting Rights laws under President Lyndon Johnson, the South, which voted overwhelmingly for Democrats, immediately switched to the Republican Party. President Johnson was warned by many of his advisors that this would happen, and he agreed with them. Then he pushed for the passage of the law anyway, because it was the right thing to do.Anyone who says the Republican Party is not based on rascism is either uneducated as to the present and historical facts, or is willfully ignoring them.</comment>

<comment>Teds dad is a pastor, right? He's not used to giving to the church, he's used to living from what the church gives. I don't doubt that Ted is devoted to Christ, and would do everything in his power to make this country more aligned with his vision of Christianity, but money is money, and Ted is a snake. </comment>

<comment>So Ted Cruz is a snake. I agree.Have you seen videos of his father teaching and preaching?If the son is a snake, what does that make the father?</comment>

<comment>An older snake.</comment>

<comment>His vision of Christianity being the key phrase. From his public statements it sure sounds like his vision has little enough in common with the teachings of Jesus.</comment>

<comment>The topic of homosexuality helps to weed out the KKKhristians from the Christians. Although both read the bible, one group follows Christ, the God who has NEVER EVER condemned homosexuality nor same sex marriage and preached love, while the other group follow other prophets as their 'god' and do everything what Christ said NOT to do. Ever notice how KKKhristians address their 'god' mostly by the generic name 'god', 'bible', 'scripture', but not Jesus Christ? Many of those KKKhristians know they are going against Christ as they deceive and brainwash their followers to do likewise. Religious homophobes are just another flavor of KKKhristians, and as Christ said about those who come in His name but bear the fruit of deception, lies and hate, they are wolves in sheep's clothing who are here to defy the Great Commandment, the highest law of the entire bible.What did GOD (Christ, not Moses, not Paul) say about homosexuality ? ..... CRICKETWhat do GOP say about homosexuality ?..... LOTS of ugly things!!What did GOD say about same sex marriage ? ..... CRICKETWhat do GOP say about same sex marriage ?..... LOTS of ugly things!!What did GOD say about divorce ? .... LOTS of ugly things!!What do GOP say about divorce ? .... CRICKETWhat's the Great Commandment of GOD ? ... love GOD AND love thy neighbor AS THYSELFWhat's the Great Commandment of GOP ? ... love GOP AND hate and discriminate othersWhat do we call those who believe in GOD ? ....Christians, Followers of ChristWhat do we call those who believe in GOP ? ....kkkhristians/republicans/conservatives/racists/anti-Christ/homophobesSo when GOP supporters mention about their "GOD", very often they actually mean GOP, with their short-sightedness they can't differentiate the small vertical bar below that letter "P" from "D" Is it by coincidence or by design that GOP makes that name close to resemble the word "GOD" to deceive? Satan can be very cunning, that's why kkkhristians disguise themselves as Christians to use religion for the evil propaganda, Christ called those people wolves in sheep's clothing and false prophets.</comment>

<comment>Also interesting to note that homosexuality does not even make the list of Commandments.You know the things "he" is so adamant about that they are specfically listed AS "Commandmants" not "suggestions" not "requests." etc.So one presumes that "he" is vastly more concerned with things like adultry than being gay.Also notewothy that people seem to think that they can be forgiven for breaking one of "his" direct Commandments but not for some of the stuff "he" really does even speak about. Which makes little rational sense.BTW it really does not help matters to call the X'ers, "kkkhrisitans" and to sugget that the GOP are the literal servents of Satan.As far as ISIS goes so are you and all the rest of us as well.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, that's what in the LAW, His Great Commandment, it's all about how we treat each other.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”Well, the GOP has been the biggest mouth to advertize and politicize Christianity and God in their campaign, but unfortunately their actions actually promote all that Christ said not to do, which makes them NOT Christians, but KKKhristians with their former link to the KKK and the Southern Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Sorry but its actually the Democrats that were the KKK guys, Jim Crow was invented and enforced and spported by the Democrats.Wallace was a Democrat.The folks turning the dogs and fore hoses on MLK etc were Democrats.The Democrat had a former KKK member Byrd represent them in DC.Own your history buddy. </comment>

<comment>You are referring to the SOUTHERN Democrats and the Dixiecrats. Back then in 1960's, Democratic President JFK was the one who released MLK out of compassion of what he was fighting for, to finally bring the Civil Right Act in 1964. Those Southern Democrats felt betrayed by their own member as President, and since then some have moved out to join the Republicans who took advantage of the situation to reel in those people, like Strom Thurmond who represented South Carolina in the Senate from 1954 until 2003, at first as a Democrat and after 1964 he switched to Republican. Not all Southern Democrats switched to Republicans, just like the Governor of Alabama George Wallace who stayed and tried to cling on to that party hoping it would come back to what it stood before.If your theory was right, the Southern States where most conservatives who support the confederate flag and the KKK, they should be pro-Obama and would have been blue states!</comment>

<comment>No I'm refering to the same party Deomocrtic party that said of candidate Obame that he was clean and had no Negro dialect and that few years ago he would have been bringing us coffee.The one that has done so little for the black community they are doing worse by nearly matrix than any other demographic despite multi-generational lock step support of the DemocratsThe GOP voted in much larger percenatge for various Civil Rights acts BTW.So the argument that racist Democrats would join MUCH more pro-Civil rights party makes as much sense as anti-Abortion folks supporting Planned Paranthood. ;)Esp when the Democratic Party was perfeclty comfortable for an ex-KKK recruiter like Robert Byrd.BTW "most" conservatives--even "Southern" ones don't support the KKK.And that presumes BTW that the oppostion to the man was/is race based--which again is just another Lefty narrative. ;)</comment>

<comment>Like I said you are still confused between the Southern Democrats prior to 1964 and the present Democrats. The GOP prior to 1964 were the Republicans indeed before they took in the Southern Democrats and Dixiecrats.Again if your theory was right, the Southern States where most conservatives who support the confederate flag and the KKK, they should be pro-Obama and would have been blue states. Go ask any person who support the KKK for the last 20 years or so to learn which party they support.Furthermore, if the current Republicans did't hate the blacks, they should NOT be fighting so hard to take down Obamacare which benefit millions of poor, blacks and minorities who couldn't afford health care!</comment>

<comment>Nope, as illustrated the "confusion" lies your direction. Your ahm....."logic" does not fit the known facts.And to even get there you have to presume the oppostion to Obama  is all racial--which you can't cause despite Lefty talking points its not. And again, multi-genrational lock step support for the Democrats and their polcies has resulted in blacks doing worse by nearly every matrix than other populations.Take abortion, Sanger--an idol of the Left had a vile "negro project" where she wanted only good/right blacks--whatever that meant in her racist mind--to have kids.Blacks make up about 13% of the population but sans abortion that number might be twice that........and with more voters comes more power, more control.The Democrats are still the party of Jim Crow--they just have a better rap.The ACA BTW is falling apart, if Democats really cared about black people they would have come up with something that worked.</comment>

<comment>"you have to presume the oppostion to Obama is all racial--which you can't cause despite Lefty talking points its not."Nothing is - ever - ever about rascism - ever.(end of snarky sarcasm for those who didn't get it)</comment>

<comment>Not "ever" No. But its not "always" either. ;)And that is the Lefty talking point after all.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, I can see all the damages of your brainwashing from what conservatives news have done to you to be completely blinded with hatred towards the current Democrats.Like I said, if you still doubt me, go and ask any KKK club which you can also look around on internet and ask them which party suit their beliefs, ideologies and political party.If your political party was so concerned for blacks, instead of them trying so hard to take the ACA down, why didn't they counter offer anything "better" , and likewise for Planned Parenthood ?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure things "logic" and "reason" and "facts" do indeed seem like "brainwashing" to the Left.We tried, nobody listened. It was a "we have the votes" kinda thing where the Democrats pushed their agenda on the rest of us---up to and including delaying the swearing in of a "nay" voter-- and now that its falling apart they are tying to pin their lack of regard on the very people very people that warned them about in the 1st place.Democrats oppose school vouchers and school choice which traps minority chidren in failing schools......so peddle the cue card rhetoric about how much the Democrats care about minorities elsewhere.I don't have to go on the net--like I said it was Democrats--mainstream Democrats that said of candidate Obama that he was "clean with no negro dialect" and that "few years ago he would have been bringing us coffee."Plus, what is with the Democratic all-white cast of "who wants to be POTUS?</comment>

<comment>Indeed Fox news and conservative news have caused more damaged to your brain than what I thought. I feel so sorry for all your brain washing.As what i've said earlier go ask a KKK member on who they have been voting for the past 20 years or so and whether they are pro-Obama.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>Again, that a Lefty views facts logic and reason as "brainwashing" is really all one needs to know about them. ;)And as I've said, you don't need to look at anonymous fringers on the web--just look at how disrespecful and dismissive  the DNC leadership was about candidate Obama.</comment>

<comment>Finally you got one thing right "was"!!! Yes they did something wrong in the past, but later on they change. It's going to be the same between Hillary and Bernie, there is only one candidate that can be nominated just as on your party of the Southern Democrats.Again as what i've said earlier go ask a KKK member on who they have been voting for the past 20 years or so and whether they are pro-Obama.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>Nope, I pretty much established that the same attitudes seem to be part and parcel of current DNC thinking.They just have a better rap these days.Again, you don't; have to look at anonymous online fringers, you just have to look at the statements made by current DNC leadership about President Obama when he was candidate Obama.</comment>

<comment>Still, that doesn't change a single thing about the fact of the Southern Democrats and Dixiecrats to have joined your party of the Republicans to be what it is today as the party of racists, anti-Obama, anti-black, anti-gay, deeply religious.Islamophobes, homophobes, racists, white supremacists, confederate flag, GOP & Republicans from 1964 onwards till today, conservatives, kkkhristians, KKK, Southern Democrats prior to 1964, Dixiecrats, they all are peas from the same pod.Democrat prior to 1964 (Southern Democrats,Dixiecrats) = Republican from 1964 till today.</comment>

<comment>But see they didn't, like I said, the Democratic Party was perfectly comfortable for ex-Klansmen Robert Byrd to spend his entire career in.What you suggest is that racist Democrats joined a pro-civil rights party where they would in the minority. Which makes about as much sense as a person deeply committed to stamping out abortion joining Planned Parenthood.And nope, that is simply Lefty narratives.And like I also pointed out. Judge not lest yea be judged.  And like you already demonstrated you a hypocrite on the use of Christianity.Its people like you that made me a non-believer..</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, actions of what people do speak louder than your confused mind.As said many many times, your theory fail completely when in reality the Southern States where most conservatives and KKK are found, they have turned from blue to red after 1964. And that you can't refute plus the fact that Republicans are the ones fighting so hard to dismantle the ACA that helps the poor and blacks to have health care.Democrat prior to 1964 (Southern Democrats,Dixiecrats) = Republican from 1964 till today.</comment>

<comment>How many of those demonstrable racist former Democrats pols actually switched parties.Maybe Thurmond?Ah.....no, you find conservatives everywhere. And there is no link between the GOP and the KKK, already established the only KKK guy was a card carrying Democrat. ;)And the ACA has nothing to do with race. Its bad policy.Democrats, the party of Jim Crow.........they just have a better rap these days.</comment>

<comment>https://www.youtube.com/watch?...You are indeed very confused and have no intelligence to process facts.As said many many times, your theory fail completely when in reality the Southern States where most conservatives and KKK are found, they have turned from blue to red after 1964. And that you can't refute plus the fact that Republicans are the ones fighting so hard to dismantle the ACA that helps the poor and blacks to have health care.Democrat prior to 1964 (Southern Democrats,Dixiecrats) = Republican from 1964 till today.</comment>

<comment>Huh?That is ONE politico---just one.And he is no worse than Klan recruiter Byrd.</comment>

<comment>Go get educated!</comment>

<comment>I would suggest the same to you.</comment>

<comment>By Fox news ? LOL</comment>

<comment>Did I say "Fox news?"Where?</comment>

<comment>You don't need to say it when you demonstrate it all over with your intelligence in your replies.</comment>

<comment>Fascinating, now in addition to being a demonstrable hypocrite on Scripture you are also a mind reader who know what people are saying when they don't say it.How are you with lottery numbers? ;)</comment>

<comment>When you are a conservative who vote Republicans, you mirror all their values, ideology, religion and beliefs. It's pretty easy to see all those in you.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure you "see" much of anything beyond little pink elephants.</comment>

<comment>Don't worry I'm not like you who can't see anything beyond little pink elephants.</comment>

<comment>So now you can't even do more than copy me?Boring.</comment>

<comment>Well, you get to taste your own boring medicine. :)</comment>

<comment>Jeez dude, think up your own insults don't steal mine.</comment>

<comment>I don't need to come up with any, you are insulting yourself :D</comment>

<comment>Which is why you keep stealing mine?Cause you DON'T need to?Well that makes about as much sense as the rest of your stuff.</comment>

<comment>hmm who started by saying that the current Dems are the Southern Dem as the original party of the KKK ?You are just like your Republican party to oppose just for the sake of opposing blindly. If Obama were to having lunch on a nice day at noon, and he were to say that it is a nice day, you dumb conservatives would say no it is a cold night, just blindly to oppose whatever he would say.Good luck with your blind lifestyle as a racist, homophobic, supporter of confederate flag and the KKK.</comment>

<comment>Ummm who started out gratuitously calling X'ers and republicans "KKK" etc?See that would be a RESPONSE to your bigotry---if you can't take it, don't dish it out.Nope, that would be more Straw men and hyperbole and Lefty talking points on your part.I am neither a "racist" nor "homophobic" nor a "supporter of the confederate flag and the KKK"And as mentioned prior, such asinine accusations are demonstrable proof of your hypocrisy on the Scripture you previously claimed was so important to you.Thank you for demonstrating the kind of unreasoning bigoted hatred people have come to expect from the Left......and thank you for demonstrating the hypocrisy at its core.</comment>

<comment>hmm are you ashamed of me describing of what you DO IN ACTIONS to be Islamophobe, homophobes, racists, white supremacists, confederate flag, GOP & Republicans from 1964 onwards till today, conservatives, kkkhristians, Southern Democrats prior to 1964, Dixiecrats, and member of the KKK ?Thank you for demonstrating the kind of lies you conservatives have been passing around for decades about who you are.</comment>

<comment>Why would I be "ashamed" of a Lefty trotting out more of the same BS Lefty talking points?Its what Lefties do. ;)Its the Jim Crow Democrats that should "ashamed".... oh they have a better rap now......but they are they same Party that the turned dogs and fire hoses on MLK.Lets look the Democratic party  of ex-Klan recruiter Robert Byrd. Who BTW was thrown a massive and lavish funeral by the DNC.Look how current leaders in the DNC spoke so slightingly of President Obama when he was candidate Obama. Look at the DNC all white cast of "Who wants to be POTUS" the Sanger idolizing DNC--with her vile "Negro Project" is firmly pro-abortion which robbed the black community of its rightful political power---just like Sanger advocated.The Black community is doing worse by nearly every measure than other populations despite lock step multi-generational support of the DNC.Yep...same old Jim Crow, same old Klan outlook......same old DNC.Like I said if you can't take it don't dish it out. ;)And thank you for demonstrating another Left hobby--projection in the psychological sense. You take your own history and feelings and "project" them onto others.</comment>

<comment>Well, again, when you are uneducated and blind, you still fail to keep understanding that you are talking about the Southern Democrats who hate joined your party of the Republicans when you got betrayed by JFK to have freed MLK.Again, why is it that you as a supporter of the confederate flag and the KKK, hates Obama and the Democrats ? Why is it that the Southern States where most of you conservatives are with your Klan, are not blue states as what they were prior to 1964 ?When you can't take the facts, you just keep lying over and over again just as what conservatives do.</comment>

<comment>"When  you got betrayed by JFK to have freed MLK"Huh? that is getting more and more unhinged. Even for you."lying over and over again....."I believe I mentioned the whole "projection" thing already. ;)Lets take an actual example instead of just mindlessly bleating the same Leftist slurs over and over.Back in the Jim Crow South the Democrats prevented black children from getting into schools and getting a good education, trapping them in a cycle of poverty.Today Democrats are against school choice and school vouchers, which trap minority children in failing schools, preventing them from getting a good education and trapping them in a cycle of poverty.Like I said, same old Democrats.Better rap, same Jim Crow outlook. :(</comment>

<comment>Are you always so desperate and foolish to you always lie ? You should read other news other than your Fox or other conservatives news channels.http://www.thewire.com/politic..."But the most evocative example comes, perhaps predictably, from Texas. In 2012, Tea Party leaders in the state renewed a "school choice" push that had stalled out several years before."http://www.republicanviews.org..."One educational program that caused a great deal of controversy between parties is President Bush’s No Child Left Behind Act. In the 2004 Democratic Party platform the Democrats spoke out against the Bush administration, saying, “For this White House, education is an easy promise – easy come, and easy go. When President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act, he said the right things – asking more from our schools and pledging to give them the resources to get the job done. And then he promptly broke his word, providing schools $27 billion less than he had promised, literally leaving millions of children behind. The President also gets a failing grade for higher education. Over the last three years, college tuitions have risen by 35 percent, pricing 220,000 students out of college. Yet while then- Governor Bush promised to increase college aid, President Bush tried to charge more for student loans and eliminate Pell Grants for 84,000 students.”Again, why is it that you as a supporter of the confederate flag and the KKK, hates Obama and the Democrats ? Why is it that the Southern States where most of you conservatives are with your Klan, are not blue states as what they were prior to 1964 ?When you can't take the facts, you just keep lying over and over again just as what conservatives do.</comment>

<comment>"Tea Party leaders in the State renewed a school choice push that had stalled out several years before."Yes, conservatives are largely in favor of school choice so minority children don't get trapped in failing schools and extend the cycle of poverty.Democrats largely oppose school choice thus trap minority children in an endless cycle of poverty.Just like in the Jim Crow South--better Democrat rap, but same old Jim Crow Democrats. :(BTW, No Child Left Behind was passed by a heavily bipartisan vote. House 354-45, Senate 91-8. So the Dems are also in that one up to their armpits.Oh and as per the WJLA/Washington Ap, July 19, 2013, article entitled "No Child Left Behind dismantled by House Republicans" things ain;t quite as you present them eitherDo try and keep up. ;) </comment>

<comment>Wow, are you really really so ILLITERATE to not even read what really happened ?Are you always so desperate and foolish to you always lie ? You should read other news other than your Fox or other conservatives news channels.Jim Crow was set by the people who have moved into your current party of the Republicans when they were the Southern Dems!Again, why is it that you as a supporter of the confederate flag and the KKK, hates Obama and the Democrats ? Why is it that the Southern States where most of you conservatives are with your Klan, are not blue states as what they were prior to 1964 ?When you can't take the facts, you just keep lying over and over again just as what conservatives do.</comment>

<comment>I just quoted what you, yourself posted.Don't blame me for your mistakes. ;)Like I said, as per YOU, conservatives support school choice and school vouchers that help minority children escape failing schools, get a good education  and get a chance to break the cycle of poverty.Democrats are against school choice which traps minority children in failing schools, preventing them from getting a good education and trapping them in an endless cycle of poverty.Just like they did back in the Jim Crow South. Wallace would be proud.</comment>

<comment>So when you conservatives are fighting between your tea party and the GOP, your blame your failure on the current Democrats ?Are you always so desperate and foolish to you always lie ? You should read other news other than your Fox or other conservatives news channels.You are just like Kim Davis, the homophobic clerk in KY who had so many divorces and re-marriage to then be preaching about "biblical marriage" while she profess to be a "democrat" with ideologies and beliefs that actually match your current party. This shows how there are many conservatives like you who are so uneducated that you can't tell the difference between the old party that was before 1964 and the one after that date.Again, why is it that you as a supporter of the confederate flag and the KKK, hates Obama and the Democrats ? Why is it that the Southern States where most of you conservatives are with your Klan, are not blue states as what they were prior to 1964 ?When you can't take the facts, you just keep lying over and over again just as what conservatives do.</comment>

<comment>Kim Davis was,until quite recently, a Democrat.She ran as a Democrat, she was elected as a Democrat by Democrats and refused to do her job while she was a Democrat.I believe it  was Republican appointed judge that issued the orders that stopped her.Again, do try and keep up.BTW Democrats passed DOMA and "Don't ask Don't tell" and twice voted down marriage equality in CA..What party operates in perfect harmony?Still does not change the fact that the GOP is largely in favor of school choice and the DNC is largely against it.</comment>

<comment>Kim Davis is a SOUTHERN Dem, voted by the SOUTHERN Dems !Again, why is it that you as a supporter of the confederate flag and the KKK, hates Obama and the current Democrats ? Why is it that the Southern States where most of you conservatives are with your Klan, are not blue states as what they were prior to 1964 ?When you can't take the facts, you just keep lying over and over again just as what conservatives do.</comment>

<comment>The keyword is "Democrat" not "southern"I keep looking for that distinction on the DNC website and can't seem to find it.. ;)And again it was, if memory serves, a Republican appointed judge that stopped her.Going to work now, enjoy your moms basement, catch you on the flipside.....when I get bored again. ;)</comment>

<comment>aha, so you choose to ignore reality as you are afraid to admit that the SOUTHERN Dems reflect your values and ideologies, and what really happened in 1964 for the switch.That's why you keep avoiding my challenge to you about the reality of why is it that you as a supporter of the confederate flag andthe KKK, hates Obama and the current Democrats ? Why is it that the Southern States where most of you conservatives are with your Klan, are not blue states as what they were prior to 1964.Your projection again shows how you are the one living in your mom's basement. Feel free to come back to me whenever you are bored, I'll educate you more about facts and reality with every single of your ignorance.</comment>

Why is it that the Southern States where most of you conservatives are with your Klan, are not blue states as what they were prior to 1964 ?When you can't take the facts, you just keep lying over and over again just as what conservatives do.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...but you said JFK "betrayed you" whom did he betray and whom is "you?"Remember the GOP voted far greater percentage than the Dems for Civil Rights.The Jim Crow Dems did not.So I'm not sure who the "you: is supposed to be. ;)Other then a Dem.</comment>

<comment>You can keep cutting and pasting the same stuff over and over it make you happy and if you have nothing better to do.Still does not change the fact that nothing much has changed in the Democrat Party.They invented and enforced Jim Crow....today they have a slightly better rap but the same old feelings about minorities.Why else would they be running an all white cast of "Who wants to be POTUS?"They don't support a single minority for that office in the upcoming elections.Why else would the DNC be run pretty much by white people?</comment>

<comment>"You can keep cutting and pasting the same stuff over and over it make you happy and if you have nothing better to do."  hmm your projection again tells more about you!Again, why is it that you as a supporter of the confederate flag and the KKK, hates Obama and the Democrats ?

<comment>hmm indeed, your projection keeps telling more about your kkkonservative as a supporter of the confederate flag andthe KKK.</comment>

<comment>The Klan is in your Republican party, that's why the Southern States have turned blue to red.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>The only actual Klansmen in context was a Democrat ;)And nope, with all due respect to wiki that is just a voting pattern in a specific election--during the Nixon Admin--who was an actual criminal , not a reflection of racism in general.Even the page you linked questions if it was. Among other things I should believe Atwater but not Dent?oh, on that topic, if you want use sources please do so correctly. Blue lining whole web pages is not proper attribution as I have no idea what line/lines you are specifically referring to.</comment>

<comment>Out of curiosity, what was the better, Republican counter to the ACA?  You do know the universal mandate was a conservative think tank's idea, right?  The ACA is definitely flawed, but you also know that the Blue Dogs (DINOs) were key in killing the single payer system that would have been truly transformative, right?And while we're at it, Republicans seem to recognize that pre-existing conditions should not be a basis to deny someone health insurance.  What isn't clear is, how do they propose to provide that insurance without making it prohibitively expensive or a universal mandate?</comment>

<comment>A better question would be if was the ACA needed in the first place.Something like 70% of people were happy with their coverage prior to the ACA, in rough terms if 7 out of 10 people are ok you help the 3, not jack things up for the 7.Democrat Chuck Schumer rather strongly implies it was a massive vote buying scheme using public monies BTW.Single payer systems would have been "transformative" alright,. but not automatically the way you presume.I'm not sure how you arrive at the idea that the GOP didn't want people with pre-existing conditions to get coverage.I have an inherent dislike of framed questions---so I'll demonstrate why.How do you suggest to cover people with the co-ops failing and the largest insurance providers pulling out?What you seem to be suggesting is that we sink the whole lifeboat so everybody drowns.</comment>

<comment>Okay, first of all, you wrote, "We tried, nobody listened."  So I'm asking you, what did you try that nobody listened to?Second of all, your premise only makes sense if those 70% are now unhappy.  Got a cite for that?   Also, if your stats are correct (didn't see a cite for that either), that meant nearly 100 million people in America are not happy with their health coverage.  If that's not a compelling reason to make changes, I don't know what is.Third, I'm saying that the GOP DOES want people with pre-existing conditions to get coverage, because that's an extremely popular aspect of the ACA.  It's been mentioned as a feature of their "alternative" to the ACA.  http://thehill.com/policy/heal...  However, I have yet to see how that is supposed to work without a mandate.Please post any citations to your allegations that people cannot get covered because co-ops are failing and the largest insurance providers are pulling out.</comment>

<comment>So you are saying you utterly unaware of the objections raised by the GOP concerning the ACA?And your OWN  linked article presents a GOP alternative,Yes I do, which I have already produced on more than one discussion on this very topic on the Atlantic. Not trying to be a pain but I also don't feel like going back over old debates for every newbie that wants to jump into old discussions.And If you wish to have a such a discussion  then you need to start citing as well. And "argument by link" does not count. You want to do it, do it right.........as an example I have no idea what specific point of the linked article you are citing.Well that does not change the idea, you still don't; jack things up for everybody else, you help the "100 million.""Compelling interest" is a very different thing from "workable solution."Make changes for THEM sure, jack up the health care for everybody else? Not really.I'm not sure that follows, again, why would a mandate be the ONLY way to fund it?Why not just cut out the billions in waste fraud and abuse and use the monies to fund the people with such conditions?Why not take the $ 1 billion plus in hard currency we are giving back to the worlds largest State sponsor of terrorism and use it to underwrite some healthcare for poor people?Hey, you asked.If you are not aware of co-ops failing and the largest companies pulling out/considering pulling out, then you need to do more research prior to commenting.Its pretty common info.Again, not trying to be a pain but I also don't much feel like getting you up to speed in order to have a discussion either.</comment>

<comment>Oh geez, I didn't realize that you are the same guy that is not convinced there is a gun problem.  I see that you still have issues with reading comprehension.</comment>

<comment>Like I said then, a MINIMUM of 290 MILLION guns. Take the number of gun murders and divide.The USA, beyond what are mainly Democratic run cities. are safe as Switzerland.("safe as Switzerland" BTW is a figure of speech, but not really that far off)You should not let innumeracy get in the way of your hysteria. ;)Presuming of course you don't see math as a sinister tool of oppression. ;)</comment>

<comment>To almost all Christians, the Bible is the revealed word of God, whether the speaker in the text is Jesus or Paul.   You can wish that historically Christianity does not condemn homosexuality, but it's pretty hard to argue it from the foundational tenets of the religion.</comment>

<comment>You could make a strong case, though, that if Christ had been concerned about homosexuality, He'd have made a point to speak out against it.  I can see a strong case for prioritizing what Jesus actually spoke about over everything else.</comment>

<comment>So what happened then to all the words that Christ spoke Himself with His own mouth when He walked as a man in flesh ? Is He not God enough ? Are His words not good enough that words of other apostles are more important to be used as excuse to then overwrite what Christ said ?Christians are Follower of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm.</comment>

<comment>The only way you can possibly have any knowledge of what Christ said is through the Bible, which was written by "ordinary" men tens to hundreds of years after Jesus spoke.   So presumably you believe that God inspired those men to transmit His words, and that the Bible is the word of God.   So, my question would be, who are you to second guess which of those words God imparted to us through that process "really" matter?(BTW, I could not care less what Jesus did or did not say about homosexuality, or what the Bible does say.   The question of equal treatment under the law and full unencumbered membership in society for gays is a secular question of social justice.   Gay people are people, and they deserve equal treatment and dignity in society.  Period.)</comment>

<comment>Indeed, the Bible is a collection of books written by men. It really matter to me on how to differentiate the different books and teachings in there, not everything is to be taken literally.Anyway I see whose side you are and I'm on your side as well for gays rights, and that's why I'm here trying to explain gay rights in the perspective of the Bible, and how indeed the words of Christ as spoken by Him are in fact about equal treatment to all. That's where homophobia and Christianity are not compatible, it's against the LAW. This is where most "Christians" who are homophobes are not aware of that, because of many false teachers like all those conservatives like Ted Cruz, Rubio etc...Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.</comment>

<comment>Let me explain why: 1. the OT condemns homosexual behavior, 2. Jesus does not DIRECTLY mention it (but clearly the definition of marriage He did speak of didn't include it and anything outside of marriage is fornication/adultery - straight out of the 10 commandments), 3. and Paul specifically condemns it.1a. In the OT when Genesis and Leviticus were written, Jews lived among pagans who did accept it and they needed to be instructed that it was sinful in God's eyes.2a. Jesus, who preached to the Jews, didn't need to spell out for them what was already known and condemned. There wasn't a gay lobby in Israel agitating for ssm and other 'rights' so obviously there was no need to bring it up. 3a. Paul spoke directly about condemning homosexual behavior because he preached to the Greeks and Romans - pagans who still had a level of acceptance of the practice.I hope that helps.</comment>

<comment>Homophobes are so foolish to be trying so hard to go against the law of the land, as set by the highest court of the country.And no wonder homophobe KKKhristians who Christ called them as wolves in sheep's clothing to be disguised as "Christians", are also so foolish to sacrifice the gift of eternal life to go against the highest law of the entire bible, the LAW, the Great Commandment of Christ, the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, for them to put hate as good to ill treat gays who they have judged wrongly. Homophobes also demonstrate their foolishness to often mention that homophobia is not written in the bible (just as pedophilia, terrorism, hacking, etc...) just failed to see what the LAW really said on what act is acceptable to then be rewarded with eternal life or salvation to be saved.Madness is what we can call those homophobes when their irrational fears and hate have consumed them. That's why they demonstrate their fear by trying to deny of that word, Homophobe, and putting laws to "protect" their so-called 'religious freedom' to judge and hate others, laws to 'protect' their so-called 'traditional marriage' or 'biblical marriage' to celebrate all the sins of sexual immoralities of divorce & adultery (Kim Davis, Rush Limbaugh, Evangelist Graham, Pam Bondi, ...), rape, pedophile (Duggars, "Christian" author John Perry as co-author of book with Mike Huckabee and Alabama Supreme Court Justice Roy Moore, ..) together with other sinners of murderers, homophobes, thieves, terrorists, etc.. so long as they come forth to get married as a man & a woman as the so-called "God's Design".Even the prophets who God chose in the old testaments like Moses, King Solomon, Abraham, and so on, they all preferred to distance themselves from those homophobic kkkhristians and their belief of "biblical marriage" to instead have many wives and concubines rather to be blessed by God. And Christ also preferred to stay away from the "biblical marriage" to become one flesh as what rapists do after they leave their parent's house, as He rather hung around with 12 dudes, to even be caught pants down with a young man as in Mark 14:51-52 ("A young man, wearing nothing but a linen garment, was following Jesus. When they seized him, he fled naked, leaving his garment behind.). It must have been some private moments of Christ being with this young man for lessons of John 3:16 on His love just as David and Jonathan did to each other as in 2 Samuel 1:26 I grieve for you, Jonathan my brother; you were very dear to me. Your love for me was wonderful, MORE WONDERFUL THAN THAT OF WOMEN !Congrats to all gay couple exchanging marriage vows to love one another in all circumstances of life till death to them part, this is how the Great Commandment is fulfilled when we stay in a faithful relationship with our partner and treat all other people around us as what we would want them to treat us. To love God means to love thy neighbor as thyself, by doing unto others as what we would want others to do unto us. Other religions also preach similar rule of karma (do good reap good, do bad read bad), empathy, compassion, mercy, live and let live, etc...Mark 12:28-34…..There is no commandment greater than these…..Matthew 22:34-40….All the LAW and the Prophets hang on these two commandmentsLuke 10:25-37….."What is written in the LAW?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the LAW and the Prophets.Leviticus 19:18 You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord.James 2:8 - If you really fulfill the royal LAW according to the Scripture, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself", you do well;Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”And only the foolish homophobes will still try to reply to this comment with lies and deceptions of words NOT from Christ or their misinterpretation of the condemnation of divorce between a man and a woman as the justification of their madness to celebrate the mortal sin against the LAW to ill treat gays with discrimination laws to prevent a gay couple who wants to exchange marriage vows to love one another in all circumstances of life till death do them part so as to live by the Golden Rule as in Matthew 7:12 to fulfill the Law, the Great Commandment of Christ.</comment>

<comment>People have been misinterpreting and selectively editing the Holy Bible to excuse and justify their favorite sins from the very beginning. None are so blind as those who refuse to see.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, you pick everything not from Christ to justify your sins to defy everything that Christ preached.Good luck!</comment>

<comment>I'll leave with this thought. Love is not a feeling. Love is the act of willing the good of the other as other. That means sometimes saying no to someone (or yourself) is the most loving thing you can do for your neighbor, even if they don't "feel" loved.</comment>

<comment>Lip service of love is not loving your neighbor AS YOURSELFJudging others WRONGLY is not loving your neighbor AS YOURSELF.Putting discrimination laws to physically ill treat and harm gays is not loving your neighbor AS YOURSELF.Lying and deceiving are not acts of loving your neighbor AS YOURSELF.If you were to be a Christian as a Follower of Christ the God who has never ever condemned homosexuality nor ssm, you wouldn't be having such anti-Christ lifestyle of homophobia and bigotry to defy all of His teachings.Followers of Christ love their neighbor AS THEMSELVES by doing unto them as what they would want others to do unto them.Homophobes are not Christians, but kkkhristians who Christ called you as wolves in sheep's clothing aka modern day pharisees, aka anti-Christ.Luke 10:25-37….."What is written in the Law?"... “Do this and you will live.”Matthew 7:12 So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the Prophets.Galatians 5:14 - For the entire LAW is fulfilled in keeping this one command: “Love your neighbor as yourself.”Matthew 7:21 “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?’ And then will I declare to them, ‘I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.’Matthew 16:27 For the Son of Man is going to come in his Father’s glory with his angels, and then he will reward each person according to what they have done.Homophobes will all perish and will not have eternal life for failing to do the will of the Father(Great Commandment - He and the Father are one), for the wages of the mortal sin is death.</comment>

<comment>Christ had a lot to say about divorce, and yet evangelicals don't seem to want to cling to his words on that subject.</comment>

<comment>Also a good point.</comment>

<comment>One of the things that most concerns me about Christians who are very quick to condemn homosexuals is that they have no skin in the game.  They are doing the very thing Christ chastised the Pharisees for: Laying heavy burdens upon others and lifting not a finger to help them.  It takes no courage to condemn sins which hold no temptation for you, hence Christ's command to remove the plank from our own eye before attempting to remove the speck from our brother's eye.</comment>

<comment>Good point.</comment>

<comment>The Christians that do have skin in the game (and there are many), are the ones that protest the loudest.</comment>

<comment>True.  But condemnation of homosexuality is hardly the foundation of the religion. It's mentioned a handful of times, alongside condemnations against eating pork and shellfish.</comment>

<comment>"against eating pork and shellfish"Now that's going too far - especially bacon.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure that a plurality of Christians actually believe that the Bible (especially the old testament) is the literal word of God any more.</comment>

<comment>I don't give a rats patootie if he tithes or not. I do care that, based on his religious beliefs, believes he's been annointed to take over all aspects of society. I don't want to live in a theocracy, I'll pass on cruz for reasons much more important than freaking tithing. </comment>

<comment>Canadian Christians don't tithe ...</comment>

<comment>There are some churches (namely the megachurches) that "encourage" tithing and promote prosperity gospel. Look at any of the big ones in Toronto.</comment>

<comment>Jesus also said that when you give, you should not let your right hand know what your left hand is doing.  Couldn't Cruz counter that he doesn't declare much of his charitable giving for this reason?</comment>

<comment>And give up the tax writeoff?  Better to elect an uncharitable hypocrite than an idiot.</comment>

<comment>How many people track their spending that closely - especially if you give small amounts to many charities?</comment>

<comment>10% of your income is very different from dropping a $20 in the collection basket.</comment>

<comment>True, but you could split the amount you give among a number of charities as the opportunity arose - especially in churches that often hold special collections for various charities and bring in people to talk about various charities.  And then, you can add in fundraisers for various causes like schools, food pantries etc</comment>

<comment>If true, it would tie into his larger narrative and be pretty admirable in my opinion.  i.e. "Of course, I tithe but I don't need credit from the Federal government for doing my duty as a Christian."</comment>

<comment>He could claim he donates without noting it on his taxes, but then he'd be doing the equivalent of saying, "I love taxes so much, I'm happy to pay even more than I owe under the law." Some of his followers might not like that either.</comment>

<comment>This could be the case, but it seems very unlikely.One of Cruz's conservative values is a disdain for all taxes and a desire for social services to be provided through voluntary contributions to faith organizations rather than through "coercive" taxes to government.  The ability to give more charity and fewer taxes is core to conservative philosophy, and I rather doubt Cruz would pay a penny more into the Federal coffers than he absolutely had to.</comment>

<comment>Yeah.....not a believer myself......but even I know most Christians don't tithe, and the idea that its a deal breaker for "Christians" in the broader sense is laughable.</comment>

<comment>In the broader sense, probably not. In the conservative, evangelical sense, I wouldn't be so sure.</comment>

<comment>Certainly possible.</comment>

<comment>I'm shocked, shocked to find that Cruz is the same sort of opportunistic politician he portrays others to be.</comment>

<comment>I'm "shocked" that people pretend "their" politicains are not.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I don't get that. Given that political sausage-making is eternal, why people don blinders and believe that "their" pol is above it is odd.</comment>

<comment>IMO everyone would be better off demanding better from their elected officials.</comment>

<comment>Cruz's miserable charitable giving only proves he's not very charitable.   But that's obvious every time he opens his mouth, so new new information there.   I wouldn't consider lack of generosity an automatic disqualification for being President, anyway.   Believing that you're “Christian first, American second," on the other hand, should disqualify anyone.   Whatever else our government is for good or bad, it's a secular government, and the oath he would take as president is to the Constitution and the nation, not the Bible and the faithful.</comment>

<comment>Many strong believers count their faith before their nationality, because they derive their moral vision from that faith. If forced to choose at gunpoint, they would deny their country before their faith, because your nationality is not of much use outside this temporal frame, if nothing else. However, as a believer, I feel no need to impose my views as laws. Our system grants me and you the right to believe as our hearts lead us. For that reason, I'd uphold and defend it.</comment>

<comment>That is a good summary of how I feel.  I render unto Caesar what is Caesar's; but were our government to pass a law that would force me to violate my conscience, I would have to disobey and accept the consequences.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You couldn't pay me enough.</comment>

<comment>I agree, and that's fine with me.   I have a lot of respect for people with that sort of foundational belief wholive out their out their beliefs.   But, I don't think such a person is qualified to be President, because that position requires putting the Constitution and the common good of people as a whole at the center of every decision they make.</comment>

<comment>Since the Constitution is a document open to interpretation and reinterpretation, I don't understand a requirement to make the Constitution (and the common good - which is wholly undefined) "at the center of every decision they make" as a requirement for fitness to hold the office of president.  First, this makes the mistake of judging by intentions rather than outcome - so long as I believe my interpretation of the common good and the Constitution are at the center of my decision to bail out the too large to fail banks, I'm good.  And, when opponents of the bailout argue that the bailouts violate the Constitution and the common good?  Second, the founders were clear that there should be no test of religious belief for fitness of office - neither proof that you belonged to the "right" faith or proof that you held the Constitution above and religious beliefs.If someone vows to impose whatever religious law upon all Americans, I would object - regardless of which religion they believed in.  BUT - that is far different from saying that Christ's command to treat the least among you as you would Christ inspired you to look at economic inequality and what role the government should play.</comment>

<comment>I'm not saying a Christian cannot be qualified to be President - that would be a religious test, and is as you say, not allowed.   I am saying that if you claim "I am a Christian first, and an American second" that your fitness for the office of President is at best highly suspect.   The oath of office is pretty clear: ""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."If you claim from the outset that you put your Christianity first, then you cannot claim to "preserve, protect and defend the Constitution" "to the best of [your] ability."   You have to be willing to say that if your Christianity disagrees with what your Constitutional office requires, the Constitutional obligation wins every time.This would be true, BTW, if you substituted atheist, Buddhist or any other system of belief for Christian in the dialogue.   I only use "Christian" because that's what Cruz said.</comment>

<comment>"and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States  against all enemies, foreign and domestic.  I see no reason to lump religion in with enemies of the constitution - especially since the text of the Constitution is clearly open to interpretation and "common good" is such a vague test that nearly any action could be defended or condemned using it.</comment>

<comment>I think Kennedy said it well when he said he was a Roman Catholic, and if ever there was a point in his duties as a President he would have to compromise his faith, he'd resign.I am afraid that Senator Cruz would take that opportunity to enforce his brand of Christianity on all of us, even those of us who are Christians but who do not think his brand of Christianity is worthy of emulation.</comment>

<comment>It's particularly hypocritical that he draws his support from the same people who wet themselves over the phantom of Sharia law.</comment>

<comment>The gods I believe in are not short of cash.</comment>

<comment>This just in:  Conservative politicians are cynical hypocrites.And middle American morons love them for it.</comment>

<comment>As are Leftist voters. ;)Hypocrisy thy name is "Leftist."</comment>

<comment>I'm pretty sure it's "Human," not "Leftist." Everyone's a hypocrite, man.</comment>

<comment>Probably.But I was just replying in kind.</comment>

<comment>Always the best way to win an argument, of course.</comment>

<comment>Not a bad point.But its not like the "drive by posting" guy I was responding to was actually wanting a real discussion.</comment>

<comment>I'm not worried about whether Cruz tithes or not. I do think it's beyond hypocritical though to have a free for all with the conservative candidates faith when doing so with Obama would have gotten you called a racist. I bet Jonathan isn't too worried about that though.</comment>

<comment>The president actually has a generous history of charitable giving.  In excess of 15% last year according to Glenn Beck's, The Blaze, website.http://www.theblaze.com/storie...</comment>

<comment>I don't even think he cares about them.  He exploited them for a political ad.  You can tell how uncomfortable they were from watching the hours of outtakes.  Comical, yet sad.-</comment>

<comment>His children are beautiful and he knows it.  Never misses an opportunity to exploit it for political advantage.</comment>

<comment>Thankfully, they got their looks from their mom...</comment>

<comment>The Republicans themselves opened the door here.  No one cares about a candidates  faith unless the candidate himself makes it an issue.</comment>

<comment>This won't hurt him at all.  If evangelicals had a problem with hypocrisy half their leaders would be gone.  These people want to hear about how the candidate will use the government to shove their beliefs down others' throats.  They could care less what he does himself.</comment>

<comment>Concern trolling, devoid of any evidence that this point actually matters to evangelical voters.</comment>

<comment>Yet you sound concerned about the concern trolling. We're concerned about you.</comment>

<comment>Many Christians were duped long ago when it comes to tithing and what it really means.  A classic example of sheep following a wolf.</comment>

<comment>True. For a long time now, the right has been claiming to be for freedom, as one example, and every time there's a vote, they promote big business and big government security over individual rights and freedom. More people need to pay more attention to what they do than to what they say.</comment>

<comment>What's with the left/right thing ?   Are you one of those who believes the other side can save us ?  Besides, I was talking about how tithing was hijacked so the church could get rich.  I don't know about you but both sides go to church.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz continues to be the biggest fraud of any candidate in the election. Yes, he has achieved a lot. No one is taking that away from him. But his values are questionable, his integrity (along with nearly every other person running) is non-existent, and he has proven to be a guy who champions preaching what will get him more acclaim over what will move the country forward.</comment>

<comment>I respecftully disagree, "frauds" are quite commonplace in any election cycle and Cruz is unlikely to "the biggest."Esp in a field where the Socialist canadite is rasing money by the capitalist selling of mersh and advocating tax plans that would likely reduce the amount of money people would have to donate to his cause in the 1st place.We have a populaist in Trump that is pretending to be a conservative.Hillary can't keep her lies stright and is now polling behind said Socialist in some areas.I don't know what to say about rest of the pack, either direction.</comment>

<comment>"A douche or a turd sandwich."</comment>

<comment>Which may well be giving them too much credit.</comment>

<comment>You can't douche a turd sandwich.</comment>

<comment>Achieved a lot. In congress?</comment>

<comment>Prior to the Congress. He has achieved NOTHING since becoming a senator.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is a second-generation con man.  He and his father take tithing, not give tithing.</comment>

<comment>True enough; but for the record, pastors (like the senior Mr. Cruz)  are supposed to tithe as an example to the congregation. Also, so that they don't ask of others what they don't do themselves.</comment>

<comment>The only reason this matters is that a large group of influential Evangelical leaders have banded together to anoint Ted Cruz as THE Christian Candidate, and they are encouraging the Evangelical rank and file to fall into line behind him. Cruz himself is making his candidacy out to be some sort of Christian crusade.Nobody expects perfection. However, Jesus did very explicitly not just allow but command His disciples to evaluate their leaders by their "fruits". One's pattern of giving is certainly a "fruit" indicative of genuine spiritual commitment, if anything is. Combined with an obvious excess of ambitious and a rather nasty streak in his personality, one might be pardoned if images of wolves in sheep's clothing start to appear.Just to make it perfectly clear, I'm not casting any stones at the man as a person. While I personally strive to give in excess of 10% per year, and most years I have, there have been a few years when I've fallen a little short. I have no ambitions or claims to be the leader of the free world, or even of any substantial group of people. To whom more is given, more will be expected.</comment>

<comment>His problem is that he is a monumental jerk.</comment>

<comment>So you're saying Teddy Cruz is nothing but a slimy  con man? Say it ain't so! </comment>

<comment>The photo of Ted Cruz says it all. Woe is me my past is coming back to haunt me and here I was thinking I would sail right into the White House. Only place Ted Cruz maybe sailing back to is Canada. Donald Trump has opened a can of worms as regards Cruz's right to become POTUS. This time though it has some legitimacy unlike the nonsense over President Obama's birth place. There are Constitutional scholars out there questioning his legitimacy but big bad know it all Ted thinks it's settled law. We shall see how that plays out but it is comforting to know the Republicans are getting a taste of their own medicine.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>You don't need to be religious to talk about faith.</comment>

<comment>Can we please stop pretending that conservative evangelical voters adhere to a coherent and legitimate set of principles?  If ever they have had values, they're a commitment to hypocrisy, greed, and oppressing anyone who doesn't look or think like them.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, it's actually kinda weird. They seem to want to be "Christian," but have all sorts of nonsense about people and politics swirling in their heads.</comment>

<comment>Easy out for a Conservative like Cruz:  "I pay too much in taxes to properly tithe. That's why I'm running for President!"</comment>

<comment>Yup.  Alternatively:  "Oh, you mean that story reported in such liberal publications as The Atlantic?  Of course Washington-based elites have it out for me."</comment>

<comment>Too true.  His audience is conditioned by Fox to believe "here's some fake BS that is really the truth, and that truth reported by all the other news services in every country is all lies."</comment>

<comment>True. Or he could claim that his taxes, which to some extent do help the poor and less fortunate, are his tithe.</comment>

<comment>Keep tithing privatized. lower taxes for all. Cruz 2016!</comment>

<comment>It really doesn't wash.  Most of the people that do tithe have much less than Cruz.</comment>

<comment>“He doesn’t tithe?”===========That's a different world. I just don't understand the religious ideologues.</comment>

<comment>Q: Will Christians vote for Ted Cruz even if he doesn't tithe?A: Yes, the same people who would have voted for Cruz before learning this will still vote for him. It won't make any statistically significant difference. It's essentially a non-issue.Also, I'm captioning the photo at the top of the article: "Ted Cruz does his impression of a typical reaction to the words 'Hey everybody, Ted Cruz just showed up!'"</comment>

<comment>When questioned about his charitable giving, I bet Sen Cruz's response will be, "Are there no prisons? Are there no workhouses?"</comment>

<comment>Ike Broflovski Jr.</comment>

<comment>More showdown on how Cruz is a hypocrite : http://www.latimes.com/busines...</comment>

<comment>So our top four presidential candidates are Cruz the hypocrite, Hillary the corrupt liar, a billionaire buffoon and a socialist crackpot.Perfect.  </comment>

<comment>Pretty sure that he just doesn't claim his charitable contributions as deductions.  Let not the left hand know what the right one is doing.  Give in secret.  etc.  That was sarcasm.  What follows is not: I find it interesting that "evangelicals"  Throw out most of the OT law except the tablets but keep the tithe. Actually that's not quite true.  They throw out Sabbath observation, which IS in the moral code but keep the tithe, which is not.  He'd be much more of a hypocrit if he didn't go to church.</comment>

<comment>This could be the case, but it seems very unlikely.One of Cruz's conservative values is a disdain for all taxes and a desire for social services to be provided through voluntary contributions to faith organizations rather than through "coercive" taxes to government. The ability to give more charity and fewer taxes is core to conservative philosophy, and I rather doubt Cruz would pay a penny more into the Federal coffers than he absolutely had to.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  I was being sarcastic in the first part of my comment.  But I think a lot of the finger pointing from evangelicals is hypocritical in that the vast majority do not "tithe".  I once went to a fairly large (1200 morning attendance) church that was quite well off financially.  We supported many missionaries, some at 50% or more of their support.  We funded many special missions projects such as funding the digging of wells, building churches, buying trucks for missionaries.  We had a large staff and not much debt.  I talked to the accountant one time and he told me that if you go on the assumption that everyone tithed it would mean the average annual income of members was around $16k!</comment>

<comment>OK, full disclosure here: I am a Christian. My husband and I tithe. I do think that it's something that people who are serious about Christian discipleship ought to be doing, or at least working towards. And I despise Ted Cruz. Having said all that, and with no chance in hell of ever voting for the man, I don't think this is an appropriate line of attack, and it isn't fair game. His religious practices are his own, and his tithing is between him and God. Besides, we already knew he was a hypocrite; can't we just use a different example?</comment>

<comment>Why not?  Doesn't this go to the issue of hypocrisy, and of whether he actually lives his faith?</comment>

<comment>I think there are other examples of his hypocrisy that are likely to have more bearing on his ability to govern, though.</comment>

<comment>How do you differentiate hypocrisy and falling short of your ideals?</comment>
