<comment>If Jeb was going to turn this around, wouldn't we be starting to see it by now?Tick tick tick tick tick tick tick. . .</comment>

<comment>Erick Erickson (yes, I know) is reporting the campaign is out of money and will stop paying staff on Saturday:http://theresurgent.com/bush-c...</comment>

<comment>If that is true (and such stories usually are), the campaign staff is already bolting to Rubio (or anywhere they can manage), and Jeb is losing his last chance to make a dignified exit. All out of resentment at Marco Rubio's refusal to "wait his turn".</comment>

<comment>I thought Jeb! literally had tens of millions to burn through still, the only thing giving him any hope.</comment>

<comment>Yes indeed.</comment>

<comment>Time to go Jeb, as we need to get serious about electing a winner. Good guy, but the Bush era is officially over.</comment>

<comment>The supply of Bushes is bottomless. Keep your eye on George P, Jeb and Columba's son and the current Texas land commissioner. A very conservative, native-born, and half-Latino (and a non-Cuban at that) candidate could be formidable, indeed.</comment>

<comment>he's also ugly as sin, with buck teeth.</comment>

<comment>My bad- actually he isn't a bad looking guy normally... it's just when he smiles that he looks like a buck tooth rat.</comment>

<comment>he can get his teeth fixed...his problem is his dad takes after gran-pa....Bush the elder was a wimp and everyone knew it. W. clearly inherited his tenacity from Barbara...JEB is his fathers son with Barbara's face (he looks like a sour school marm), George P. might do well as its clear his sister got the 'phuckup' genes.</comment>

<comment>Indeed. It's time we elected someone of the right race:24ahead.com/s/george-p-bush</comment>

<comment>Afghan vet too</comment>

<comment>Forgot that. Thx.</comment>

<comment>What makes someone think they should run for president after their father and brother have been president? Do they really think the presidency is a family business?</comment>

<comment>actually, Jeb! was supposed to be President in 2000, not George.  Then Jeb lost the Florida governor's race in 1994, making a presidential campaign impossible.  Meanwhile, Shrub won in Texas in 1994...and the rest is history.Personally, I like to think that there is an alternative planet earth where the Supreme Court didn't steal the election for Bush, we had 8 years of Gore instead of Shrub, followed by 8 years of Jeb instead of Obama.   That planet earth is in much better shape right now than ours is...</comment>

<comment>George W. Bush would have been the greatest Commissioner of Baseball since Kennesaw Mountain Landis.  He would never have let the All Star Game end in a tie, and he'd of banned every last steroid user from the Hall of Fame.</comment>

<comment>9-11 would have still happened and the housing bubble would have still happened. Iraq probably would not have happened. And BTW the SCOTUS didnt steal it for GW Bush. Gore tried to steal it, but he failed.</comment>

<comment>Well if just Iraq had not happened, wouldn't the world be very different?</comment>

<comment>Why so different? Progressives would just have picked a different issue to try to destroy Bush.</comment>

<comment>Yeah Iraq isn't a reason to hate Bush at all</comment>

<comment>Er... why? Bush ignored multiple warnings about Bin Laden, brushing them off as distraction from his fixation with Iraq. And to say that Gore would embrace neoliberalism is a dramatic assumption. Had Gore been President, it's unlikely 9/11 or the recession would have occurred. Also, let's not be stupid concerning the rigging of the election in Florida. Had Gore pushed for the necessary recount, we would have seen him win the state. There is no disputing this.</comment>

<comment>That's insane, there's no way Gore or anyone else would have prevented 9-11. That's delusional.</comment>

<comment>Whaaaat? Did you take a nine month nap when Richard Clark went ballistic after 9-11? Bush actually disbanded the task force in charge of getting Bin Laden. Get real, a responsible administration would have heed the warnings. And a real president wouldn't have sat on his bottom for eight minutes after being told "The nation is under attack!" Get real.</comment>

<comment>all he knew was that a strike was going to happen, but that it would be soon or a few years from now, no one knew the exact date, it's like predicting earthquakes it's not an exact science, even clinton ignored multiple warning about bin ladin, from Mogadishu, to USS Cole, to the Embassy bombings. attack once with bush in charge. by the way, independent recounts by two major liberal newspaper conceded that W. would've still won the crucial state of florida.</comment>

<comment>The question is, did he receive actionable intelligence?  For Bush, the answer is pretty clearly no. But Bill Clinton did, more than once, but passed on it. Clinton also left the FBI and the CIA not talking to each other due to the "Gorelick wall".</comment>

<comment>www.theatlantic.com/politics/a..."But the same Defense Department officials who discounted Clarke’s warnings pushed back against the CIA’s. According to Eichenwald’s sources, “the neoconservative leaders who had recently assumed power at the Pentagon were warning the White House that the C.I.A. had been fooled; according to this theory, Bin Laden was merely pretending to be planning an attack to distract the administration from Saddam Hussein, whom the neoconservatives saw as a greater threat.”"</comment>

<comment>It's all part of Divine Providence's splendid plan.</comment>

<comment>Gore wouldn't lasted 1 terms, days after 9/11, he'd be asking for environmental impact reports on the effects of dropping bombs on afghanistans ecosystem, before deciding to launch a few cruise missiles, and declare victory.</comment>

<comment>Meh, considering that most of what Obama did in his first six years in office was to stop the hemorrhaging Bush had started, I call shenanigans on 1/2 of your argument. </comment>

<comment>Hillary thinks she should be president because she's married to Bubba Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Jeb! 's biggest problem is that he has yet to give voters a compelling reason to support him...</comment>

<comment>He's more electable and intelligent than The Donald; saner and likable than Cruz; experienced and worldly than Rubio.</comment>

<comment>But he's as charismatic as a gray love sock, and looks like a tired lesbian.</comment>

<comment>HA! Yeah, the bar is pretty low, I admit.But any of the ¡Three Amigos! scare the hell out of me.</comment>

<comment>Charisma is a overrated.  It may help win elections, but isn't that important of a quality for a good leader.  Competence >> charisma.</comment>

<comment>A tired lesbian who always has her stolen by the resident bully</comment>

<comment>No he isnt.</comment>

<comment>Oh yes he is!</comment>

<comment>No one named Bush is electable. If Jeb was sane, he wouldnt be running period.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, was parodying "Oh yes she is" from a Family Guy scene.Seriously speaking, I fully agree with you. The Bush family would be best staying out of presidential politics, perhaps endorsing someone at most.</comment>

<comment>In my opinion, Jeb! will almost certainly endorse Kasich.</comment>

<comment>After Super Tuesday and possibly as early as the South Carolina aftermath, Bush will be strongly encouraged by party leaders to endorse Rubio. My bet is he'll be so conflicted he keeps his mouth shut.</comment>

<comment>Or Clinton. Not that there's much difference there.</comment>

<comment>Good point.</comment>

<comment>Unless something has radically changed in the last week, Kasich does not have the money & organization to go much further.</comment>

<comment>Why you must be some sort of super-genius.  What good would that do for Kasich?  Another 1% bump in HIS crappy numbers?</comment>

<comment>Actually, I get the sense that Jeb would rather not be running.</comment>

<comment>All true. But being intelligent, electable, sane, likable, and experienced are all negatives, not positives, for much of the Republican base.</comment>

<comment>I hate that this is kind of true. I would love to see a Goldwater revival and revolt, splitting the party, and moving into the center on social issues while maintaining a strong libertarian core on governmental, foreign policy and economic issues. </comment>

<comment>Trump's this generation's Goldwater. Not libertarian, no, but then again, libertarians are "loozahs" (The Pauls, Badnarik, Bob Barr, etc.).</comment>

<comment>Obama and jeb! share the same feckless, "ethics-lite" beltway-insider temperament.  Trump will put O'Bama in federal prison where he belongs.</comment>

<comment>His response in one of the debates to Trump's Muslims plan was OK, he just needs to do more of that.I'm surprised by how weak and wimpy he looks and acts compared to his bro. Jeb needs to mountain bike out to clear some brush or something. Or hire Naomi Wolf to outfit him with some shoulder pads.</comment>

<comment>Or high-heeled shoes ("Pump, wedge, or stiletto, Marky?") like Marco Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Jeb Bush is 6'4".</comment>

<comment>Well, Jeb! certainly gave THIS voter a reason to oppose his feckless candidacy:1.) As soon as the crybaby jeb! went from 13% to 3% in the polls, he responded by buying saturation "war on ISIS" ads on T.V.2.) Jeb! has a track record of sleazy business partners.3.) Jeb! had the gall to state:  "Well, I know at least one thing :  my brother kept us safe!"  ( So, um, the ONE thing jeb! knows "for sure" is a patently absurd falsehood. )</comment>

<comment>What do you do with bad polling numbers and millions of dollars of superpac money?Fold the campaign and fold that money right into your back pocket and walk away smelling like a rose, baby.</comment>

<comment>If we was any kind of a man he would have folded his tent after NH, but that Bush pride just wouldn't let him do it. Adios, amigo.</comment>

<comment>He thinks he's entitled to the office of the presidency because his pappy and bruddah got it. The voters don't seem to agree.</comment>

<comment>Make sure you check out the Uncensored News and Views channel!They are a bunch of homophobic hate mongers. It’s truly disgusting what they say. I implore all open-minded people to pay them a visit and tell them how you feel!!https://disqus.com/home/channe...</comment>

<comment>So, that's one more older conservative white male disaffected with the republican party elites. Sounds like he should vote for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Conservative? In what universe?</comment>

<comment>Pretty much all of them. 20 years ago, Boehner was the most conservative man in the house, now he's a "RINO" because anyone not completely pure is. Jeb! Is at least as conservative as Reagan, if not more so.</comment>

<comment>Midway down the article, the phrase "Bush is pulling out" seemed suddenly prescient.</comment>

<comment>Come a listen to a story bout a man named JebBush family shmuck watchin' family fortunes ebbThen one day while Columba got a quickieHe got backstabbed by a Governor NikkiHaley that is- Indian Gold, Carolina tea.</comment>

<comment>::round of applause::</comment>

<comment>Not half bad.</comment>

<comment>Not half good either.</comment>

<comment>I'd feel bad for Jeb Bush, except, it's Jeb Bush.</comment>

<comment>but he kept us safe!</comment>

<comment>I know this is ironic but downvoted anyway.</comment>

<comment>He'd be a fine president, I'm sure.  He was a great governor.  It's just not his time - "Illegal Immigration is an Act of Love".  Ick.  That kind of treacly bullisht just doesn't play anymore.  The country is a shambles, we need actual solutions to actual problems.</comment>

<comment>Look at the broken veins in his nose in that picture.  Are the Bushes drinkers?  W. certainly had his history with it.</comment>

<comment>Compare it with a picture of Ted Kennedy. That should tell you.</comment>

<comment>For God's sake Jeb give it up. Poor Barbara is tired of being dragged out to help your lack luster self. Looks like George has gone back to Texas he knows you are a lost cause. Don't even think of bringing out poor George Snr that would be the last straw. People would boo you for becoming Desperate Dan. The exclamation mark was a mystery to start with now we know what it means. Do you want me or not? Short answer is no they don't.</comment>

<comment>jeb! ignored Barbara's advice.  She counseled NOT to run.</comment>

<comment>No. He has second life: Dick Cheney has allowed Jeb! to suck some of his blood.</comment>

<comment>Jeb!'s been turned!!!</comment>

<comment>Jeb Bush is a good man and would probably do well as president, but it's just not his time.  Hopefully, he will release his supporters to Rubio and not Kasich so Rubio can unite the party and defeat trump and then HC.</comment>

<comment>He is a Bush, he'd be a lousy president, just like the last two. Beyond that he comes off as low T and total p*ssy...</comment>

<comment>Was never going to vote for Jeb, but feel bad for him. He's actually one of the saner candidates, though his bloodline and policies are decidedly unappealing.When the nation sees who's leading the party, and who's obstructing a SCOTUS nomination process in the Senate, people will grow weary. If Republicans want to press forward with Trump, Cruz and Rubio, be my guest. Any of those guarantees a Dem win in November. Kasich is perhaps the only person who could really challenge Hillary head-to-head, or contrast Sanders enough to make the pragmatic governance argument.Jeb's timing was off. He never made his case that calm and cool conservatism is the best chance at winning the White House. Perhaps he was caught off guard by the irrational response to the likes to Trump, Cruz and greenhorn robot Rubio.</comment>

<comment>Obama obstructed a SCOTUS nomination process in the Senate, didn't he?</comment>

<comment>No, he didn't. He mentioned it as something he could support. He didn't actually obstruct.{And no, I'm not an Obama supporter.}</comment>

<comment>No more Bush's, Clinton's, Kennedy's, and especially Obama's.</comment>

<comment>Relax. Michelle doesn't want the job, and his children haven't left secondary education yet.</comment>

<comment>No more use of apostrophes to pluralize words.Do you also write "strawberry's" when you mean more than one?</comment>

<comment>He should get out and let the reasonable Republicans unify behind Kasich.</comment>

<comment>He's in it for himself.</comment>

<comment>Masochist?</comment>

<comment>Delusion runs in the family.  Jeb will be in the race until his money runs out, in May or June.</comment>

<comment>Haley's endorsement of someone makes me less likely to vote for them. Not that I would ever vote for Jeb!, anyway.</comment>

<comment>Watching Jeb! campaigning is like watching a walking talking corpse. Just...you're dead, Jeb!, you can't win, come to terms with reality. Your donors are gonna leave really soon, and you don't wanna be the guy that dropped out because his rich friends left him, do you? What a delusional moron.</comment>

<comment>Too bad Jeb! won't be able to hold down the fort until Jenna's ready to take over.To receive the full benefit of that statement, allow it to percolate amongst your brain cells for a few moments before the itching starts and you feverishly claw at your skull.</comment>

<comment>I actually Jeb Bush would probably be a half-decent president, certainly more qualified than some of the other clowns running, but it's never going to happen.  He should terminate his campaign as an act of love.</comment>

<comment>The two lowest performers in SC need to bow out. Consolidation is needed.</comment>

<comment>Kasich won't drop because he just took 2nd in NH. Bush won't drop because his daddy won't let him, and Carson won't drop because he'd have to wake up from his nap.</comment>

<comment>Trump clearly benefits from this dynamic, BTW.</comment>

<comment>No more Bushes, no more Clintons, no more Obamas, no more Kennedys, more Palins,  no more McCains, no more Rockerfellers.  If we can start there we might be in a better place.</comment>

<comment>Can I call you Cato for short?</comment>

<comment>Call me anything you want, just not late for a shooting range date or dinner.</comment>

<comment>Why that?  The thing Cato was most known for was promoting and defending the patrician system over the leaders supported by the people.</comment>

<comment>Gordon and Trenchard were the authors of the "Cato Letters" in Great Britain in the early 1720's.  They were republicans raging against the Whigs, sort of Leveller revivalists, and very influential amongst the patriot faction in the colonies.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Where do we get this no more Obamas, no more Palins, no more McCains thing? I wasn't aware of Track's political aspirations.</comment>

<comment>Michelle may run for something.  The Palin daughter seems to be out there in media.  McCains daughter hosts a tv show.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense.  Obama's failed presidency precludes any conceivable interest in a re-run under Michelle.</comment>

<comment>I can see her running for Senate or something in Illinois.  Don't forget these people are media and left wing darlings.  Yes, Obama has a near complete record of failure but that did not stop Hillary.</comment>

<comment>I hope Jeb(!) stays in the race sucking up and squandering donor money, diluting Trump's opposition, hoping by some miracle he'll be nominated in a brokered convention.Plus Trump bullyciding him is endlessly entertaining.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure Jeb is a nice guy and a reasonably competent executive. However, when you intend to run and win without the support of the base, you are not going to win. When the base wants illegal aliens deported, you don't pander to them, by suggesting that the base are xenophobes. You say what the base wants and we want them out of here. You don't run as a candidate who wants to turn the US into North Mexico. Some advice to Team Bush. Pack it in guys, you're finished after South Carolina. And Good Riddance to the entire lot of you.</comment>

<comment>You don't run as a candidate who wants to turn the US into North Mexico.Maybe his "little woman" (har-har) has something to do with that.</comment>

<comment>I don't think you understand the definition or application of the word "pander."</comment>

<comment>whatever the establishment does, they better coalesce behind one guy and do it soon, because of trump and Cruz both stay in for the long haul, the remaining candidates can't be splitting any more delegates if they want to win.I would say Bush should drop out now, or after SC if he is determined to see it through, and Kasich should drop out as well, since Ohio is a week after Super Tuesday. Bush & Kasich should then back Rubio and Rubio should float hints that Kasich "could" be a VP choice before Ohio's primary. The establishment may also want to try and keep Carson in the race to dilute trump / Cruz support. Then whatever Pac / RNC / establishment money is still out there needs to slaughter Cruz, and Rubio needs to beat up Trump in debates. Too many attack ads on trump and he might just run as an independent. you almost have to let him self destruct as the field narrows and he gets hit with more specific policy detail requests.If they don't do it soon, we're going to be stuck with an un-electable blowhard jingoistic psychopath, or a false-prophet, fake-Christian, tent-revival snake-charming sleaze ball to run against Clinton or Sanders... neither of those two guys carried any battleground states either, where Rubio likely secures Florida, and if he picked Kasich as VP he might get Ohio too. Rubio can also get some minority votes and definitely more female votes than the other two. Rubio isn't anything special IMO, but if the GOP thinks they're going to win, he's their only shot as I see it. </comment>

<comment>Trump is demonstrating to all the world that the GOP establishment and its puppet media outlets are something like the Wizard of Oz, full of sound and fury but lacking any substance at all.Given the rest of you comment, you really should be happy about that and maybe even thinking of doing a cross-over vote for Trump in the primary, if your state allows it.Trump is simply the best.</comment>

<comment>Trump is as content-free as the worst of them.You're confusing an emotionally insecure, vulgar, carnival-barking boor with a statesman.</comment>

<comment>And how are any of the others any better?</comment>

<comment>Their manners are better, but with regards to policies?At least a few of them have more coherently stated policy agendas, but I find their agendas to be no better than Trump's content-free, Trump-centric "agenda".This crop of Republican contenders for the White House is a perfect example of what happens when a political party's agenda has been clung to for too long.  The GOP is now a sclerotic mess, not unlike the way in which Michael Foote's Labour Party was (except from the political right rather than the political left).</comment>

<comment>Seems Democrats Hillary and Bernie learned to cook at the Jim Jones "Kool-Aid" academy.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't underestimate Cruz. His current stature suggest that he may be more than a false-prophet, fake-Christian, tent-revival snake-charming sleaze ball. Especially if Democrats are stupid enough to nominate Sanders, Cruz may well have the political talent to rally American conservatives. You definitely know where he stands.</comment>

<comment>Sorry, Kenny.  Cruz is ineligible under the U.S. constitution to ever be President and a Cruz candidacy could never survive a court challenge from a candidate with "standing". So sorry you don't like the news:Teddie Cruz is sure to loseHillary will share a cellHer very special place in hellBernie soon will age and croakForgetteth not what I hath spoke.</comment>

<comment>Please clap.</comment>

<comment>Hey, look... it's the Incredible Shrinking Jeb(!).</comment>

<comment>Not your year Jebber. And the worst of it is you can look forward to throwing your support to Rubio, and if he fails endorsing Trump or Cruz..Sound of scraping bottom of barrel.</comment>

<comment>Sounds like it's his turn IN th...oh, never mind.</comment>

<comment>Please join us at the Burning Bush ceremony, with adulation to the soon to be parted from the race.</comment>

<comment>Jeb made a serious strategic error early in the campaign:Not enough explanation points (!). Should have been !!!!!!!!YEB!!!!!!!!!Who knew?</comment>

<comment>I'm not a fan of the Bush brothers, but it is certainly ironic that Jeb is the best qualified candidate among the Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Low bar there. Very, very low bar. I mean Limbo-land low bar. Without the catchy beat.</comment>

<comment>You need to adjust the little propeller on your tin-foil hat, there Poindexter.</comment>

<comment>Maybe this'll put to rest the idea that you can buy votes. Yes, money matters. You certainly can't mount a serious campaign if you're struggling to raise funds. But Trump has shown that you don't have to spend a lot of money to win and Sanders has shown that you don't have sell your soul to big donors either. The real question is not whether Jeb! will drop out, but when and if it'll be before or after Kasich. My bet is that Carson will drop out before either of them. But what should really be entertaining is when Jeb! has to endorse Rubio.</comment>

<comment>'Low-energy'. A genius label that Trump applied to Jeb with a branding iron. It sticks because it fits so well.</comment>

<comment>"Linguistic kill shots" always fit so well. If they didn't, they wouldn't be kill shots.</comment>

<comment>Note to the oligarchs:  Don't fret just yet.  Hillary Clinton still has your interests at heart and she's still in the race.Caution:  Nevada ahead.</comment>

<comment>The Republican field is so weak that they are resulting to the prettiness factor with Rubio. Man, they have to reset and produce a policy vision!</comment>

<comment>Its like an undead, it won't go away</comment>

<comment>I hope he hangs around to explain Iraq some more.</comment>

<comment>Jeb won't quit. He has believed he is entitled to the Presidency for twenty years. He can't be a lobbyist in D.C. since he has never been there. Being a lobbyist in Tallahassee is beneath him. He has been embarrassed by a nouveau riche guy... a grave insult to the patrician that lives in Jeb's soul. He is going to march on to at least Florida. He is going to make Rubio, another line jumper, pay at the polls. It is amazing to watch these huge egos collide to the wreckage of the party formally known as the Republican Party.</comment>

<comment>Ok I am on the Dem side, but it is obious to me that the best thing for Jeb is to be the statesman-to step aside and endorse Rubio or Kasich, much as that might hurt his ego-because putting his party and country ahead of himself is the surest way to endear him to Republican voters.If he does this-works to defeat Trump by stepping aside this time his chances next time are much better and that's his only realistic chance. Bill Clinton lost the race for governour of Arkansas and waited and came back a much better poltiican-the lessons he learned from that loss were what enabled him to win the presidency.Jeb can't win now with the antiestablishment furor-but he can act to make his chances much better next time-that's my take.</comment>

<comment>How will jeb! awarding his 1% in anyway bolster Robio or Brother Lehman?</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter what Jeb! does. His brother is widely considered one of the worst presidents this country ever had by most of the left and a hefty portion of the right. Most people remember the wars, Halliburton profits and $4 gas. His father wasn't particularly memorable save for deplorably using the death of 290 people on Iranian flight 655 as a campaign slogan.It'll be a generation or more before another Bush can get elected, and only then because people always forget.  As things get worse (and they will), people will long for the "good old days", forgetting that the good old days weren't that good.</comment>

<comment>I feel compelled to defend his father. As president, he was given a tough row to hoe, and he managed it with competence. President of the United States as the Soviet empire collapses? Christ, that's no easy place to be.</comment>

<comment>Wrong, Ken.  Biggest missed opportunity in all of U.S. history.  Bush and team  froze out moderates in Russia, so we got oligarchs, kleptocrats and their prince Putin instead.</comment>

<comment>Let's be honest here - Nikki Hailey threw in her support for the Koch-backed candidate because she's charting her own political future.</comment>

<comment>Its over, Jeb.  Go make macaroni art like George or something.</comment>

<comment>The Bush family is a living demonstration of regression to the mean.</comment>

<comment>Americans are sick of “politicians.” We gave them a GOP majority and they didn’t do a damn thing with it. Paul Ryan is another disaster. He handed obama whatever obama wanted. The whole kit and caboodle! TRUMP 2016!!</comment>

<comment>Naw, I am sure he still has a hundred million or so  in campaign donations to burn before it's over. Nice work if you can get it.</comment>

<comment>At least Jeb! can retire off the campaign contributions.  It will be entered in the ledger as a 'general and administrative' expense.That was originally Marco's grand plan conceived from his Miami papi used car salesmen mentor.He originally was supposed to be a ringer candidate but got thrust into this position of 3rd place winner by virtue of being the leftover residue neocon candidate.  He is over his head right now. Hard to think on his feet and memorize speeches over 30 seconds.  That's how he got through Florida State Law School and the Florida legislature. </comment>

<comment>Amnesia? Diebolds make operate most voting machines, they came through for George in Ohio and will deftly "fix" it up.</comment>

<comment>We certainly hope so</comment>

<comment>Poor Jeb!.</comment>

<comment>Republicans dominate American politics, with all of Congress and most all of the states. And now, in a presidential election year, they are set to nominate Marco Rubio. Funny world, ain't it?</comment>

<comment>"Is This Finally It for Jeb Bush?"Does anyone really give a damn?</comment>

<comment>If Jeb thought that his brother which was one of the worse Presidents we ever had was going to boost his campaign he was sadly mistaken. President Bush killed our economy and got us into a war that should of never taken place.</comment>
