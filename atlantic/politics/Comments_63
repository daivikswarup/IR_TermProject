<comment>Ronald Reagan must have hated rule of law more than Obama does, I guess. 406 pardons and commutations. </comment>

<comment>Jessica Pietrzak has a better comment than you.How embarrassing.</comment>

<comment>OBAMA!  Clemency and mercy have no place in the America we've become.</comment>

<comment>Obama really has a soft spot for drug dealers.   Which I guess is understandable given his use of illegal street narcotics.</comment>

<comment>Like George and Jeb and Bill!</comment>

<comment>Obama does have extensive history of drug use which might still continue today.   That could not be said of the people you named.</comment>

<comment>The same could be said of the people he named.</comment>

<comment>Pretty extensive history of substance abuse by those Bush boys, I'm afraid.The trouble with Obama haters is that you just try so, so hard.  You've like the little boys who cried "Wolf." Important messages got ignored in all the over heated hatred. </comment>

<comment>I don't hate Obama, by any means.But if he did what I did when young...</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your comment.  Any evidence to support the insinuation that President Obama is currently using illegal drugs?</comment>

<comment>You mean besides the dull, glazed look in his eyes and his inability to acknowledge reality?</comment>

<comment>Thanks for your response, but I think most folks would disagree that the photo above captures a "dull, glazed look in his eyes"....</comment>

<comment>...and me.</comment>

<comment>Jeb, at least, has admitted to significant pot use and we know that 43 had significant history of substance abuse. Obama has been clear about using  drugs as a teen.  "Muling?" Perhaps you spend too much time on conspiracy websites.</comment>

<comment>Snore. You offer three links to stories that are well known and not denied by Obama- in fact supported by his own statements about teen-aged drug use. So what? Jeb has acknowledged his own drug use at Andover. Then you throw in an unsubstantiated accusation. Pretty typical troll stuff. </comment>

<comment>president crackhead...obama is such a disgrace.</comment>

<comment>Eh, they'll all be back behind bars soon enough.</comment>

<comment>I know many people do not agree with Obama releasing inmates but seriously things need to change.  It is to our shame, as the land of the free, that we incarcerate more people than any other country in the world.  Unfortunately, his actions are just a drop in the bucket.  States need to follow suit and violent offenses also need to be re-examined.  Let me give you an example - Lenny Singleton.  Lenny committed 8 "grab and dash" robberies in a 7 day period while high on alcohol and crack.  He did not murder anyone.  He did not have a gun.  Not one person filed as a his victim.  He didn't even physically injure anyone.  He stole a total of less than $550 and these were his first felonies.  The judge, without any explanation to the court or Lenny, gave him more time than repeat violent offenders, rapists, child molesters, and murderers -- 2 Life Sentences plus 100 years with no chance at parole.  To illustrate his reformed nature, during the entire 20 years in prison so far, he has not received a single infraction for anything - rare for lifers.  To keep Lenny behind bars for the rest of his life will cost taxpayers well over a million dollars -- for stealing less than $550 in crimes where no one was physically injured???  This makes absolutely no sense.  Obama can't grant Lenny a pardon because his case is a state case.  To learn more and sign Lenny's petition, please visit www.justice4lenny.org.  It is time things change in this country.  I am thankful for Obama's actions, but it is just a drop in the bucket.  Wake up America!  We have a long way to go!</comment>

<comment>He should pardon every prisoner who in for simple possession of pot or hash</comment>

<comment>Interesting. Thanks.Rubio and Jindal were both born in US, are over 35, and presumably meet the 14 year residency requirement. How, in your view are they not eligible? </comment>
