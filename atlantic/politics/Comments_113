<comment>I don't see America falling in love much with the love-child of Grover Norquist and Grandpa Munster.</comment>

<comment>I see Joe McCarthy more than Grandpa Munster.If Cruz wins the GOP nomination, he'll find that the U.S. is not 50 Texases.</comment>

<comment>I have always thought he looked a lot like Crazy Joe myself.  I don't suppose Texas voters are smart enough to give the boot to this embarrassment to the state in the next election cycle.  Maybe deport him, but to where?  Canada wouldn't take him now that he gave up his citizenship he held for 40 some years, and even Cuba might refuse too.</comment>

<comment>Grandpa Al Lewis was a far lefty, so Tailgunner Joe fits Cruz better.The Constitution requires that the president be a natural born U.S. citizen, but I don't care about a candidate's nativity. Twenty years of citizenship, most of it spent here, would satisfy me.</comment>

<comment>Don't go soft. He's a Cubanadian Anchor Baby. I want to see his original long form Certificate of Live Birth.</comment>

<comment>He somehow reminds me of either a serial killer, or an alien wearing a Ted Cruz suit. Either way I wouldn't want to see his basement.</comment>

<comment>" They are the seething fringe of Tea Party rallies and talk radio, of antigovernment email lists and small-town committees for individual rights. If Cruz succeeds in riding them to the nomination, it will mean more than one man's candidacy; it will mean the right wing has succeeded in completing its hostile takeover of the Republican Party."Not doing a bad job of seething yourself, Molly.</comment>

<comment>Truth hurts eh?</comment>

<comment>I'm looking forward to the day when the far right's criteria for evaluating candidates is more sophisticated then "normal people hate person X, therefore I like person X."</comment>

<comment>The far right, or the Tea Party are not the supporter of Trump. Those are mostly Reagan Democrats, independents and non involved Republicans. Hate or even dislike are not what drive Cruz supporters. Conservative and religious principles drive Cruz supporters. The supporters believe the poor, and everyone else are better off following their principals. They might be wrong, but they believe that.</comment>

<comment>Normal people seem to like the kinds of politicians who have racked up a $20 trillion debt.  They get tricked by promises of free stuff and end up selling their freedom cheap.  The average IQ in the USA is about 104.  Since that is average I guess it would also be normal but it is not too damn smart and by mathematical definition, about half the population is even dumber than that and the Democrats have cornered the market on that demographic which correlates very strongly with being reliant on the social welfare state.I'm perfectly OK with not being normal and not agreeing with normal people.</comment>

<comment>If you want to get the average IQ of a Republican Party voter, you won't need double digits.  And they do have a monopoly on the welfare state…..dumbass whites voting against their own interests (who are the majority of welfare recipients) and the ultra-rich (who take more from the government than all the rest combined) are the takers.  Who ya gonna be mad at?</comment>

<comment>Cruz has a stronger hold on the Evangelical wing than the Tea Party.</comment>

<comment>Probably true but he is doing very well with both.  And there is a lot of overlap between the two.  In many polls he is in 2nd Place in New Hampshire and it is not know for lots of Evangelicals.He seems to be doing fairly well with a broad cross-section of the Republican Party because his poll numbers are almost equal to that of all of the other candidates combined excluding the outsiders Trump and Carson.</comment>

<comment>No. Cruz is hated by Republican elites who seem to favor Trump more than him.Trump is also more electable if we're being honest. Cruz only appeals to the farthest of the far right. Man wants us back on the damn gold standard for goodness sake, something even the most inebriated economist would tell you is a horrible idea.Its hard to love a man who loves nothing. Cruz is a textbook sociopath.</comment>

<comment>Not so sure about that. That ego may be badly in need of healthy self-love.</comment>

<comment>Sociopathy makes the world go round, friendbeing nice is social stagnation</comment>

<comment>No, it is social lubrication.  Your worldview is narcissistic and inconsistent with reality.</comment>

<comment>Most sociopaths understand the value of superficial charm. When you lack the same emotional range as the majority of others, you have to have a polished act.</comment>

<comment>Sounds just like something a sociopath would say.</comment>

<comment>"being nice is social stagnation"Nope, that's exactly backwards. The reason that human society is advanced is cooperation - you can't build airplanes and nuclear reactors when you're worried that a stranger might bash your head in at any moment.The almost...fetishization...of narcissism and sociopathy among a certain class of social outcasts shows that we need to do a better job of teaching people what those things really are.  They're not advantages, they're terribly damaging to the vast majority of people who suffer from them.  Narcissists and folks with APD think that they're clever manipulators, but most of the time their behaviors result in terrible problems in their own lives (that they then end up blaming on the rest of the world while they rot in prison or drink themselves to death.)  For the tiny minority that can keep their impulsivity under control, sure, they might be more successful than average in exchange for the complete lack of a connection with other people.  Not what I'd call a great trade.</comment>

<comment>lol this amount of hamsteringbaseline social cohesion is not an excuse to overlook sociopathy - something the west needs to start learning</comment>

<comment>I don't think you understand - what you said amounts to "successful social systems are not an excuse to overlook disordered ones."  Spend some time around people with NPD. especially the antisocial types, and then come tell me how viable it is as a lifestyle, heh.  Spoiler - people with those disorders are highly attention-seeking and obsessed with self-aggrandizement.  Is it really surprising that they report how great it is to have this particular mental illness?  No.  It is, however, surprising that non-disordered people are naive enough to believe them...  Oh well, like I said - your tune would change if you had some experience of what you're talking about.</comment>

<comment>i dont think you understand - sociopathy is healthy and society succeeds because of itthe fact that it is pathologized shows egalitarian fear</comment>

<comment>Sociopathy is "antisocial personality disorder."  It's literally the opposite of healthy for society by its very definition.Can you explain why you think what you do?  What do you see as desirable about it?</comment>

<comment>your academia is tainted by social beliefs and need to be purged of egalitarianism before it can be regarded as authoritativeits no surprise that civilization has been driven by a-holes who wanted more power, money, glory, land, women etcfor example: america would be little more than a backwoods commune were it not for sociopathic colonists, imperialists, industrialists, wall street types, etc</comment>

<comment>True, but it really does suck for the people that were driven into the ground by the likes of Genghis Khan, Mao, Stalin, etc. et al. Basically you are posting a counter-factual, we might be better without all these a-holes, but how would we know because in reality there are so many of them.</comment>

<comment>You need to spend a little more time among the sociopaths -- like I have -- then you'd never try to reason with one.</comment>

<comment>Haha, I sincerely doubt he actually is.  He's a groupie, bizarre as that sounds.  Most people with APD have no conception of themselves as disordered and the ones that do and see it as an advantage take pains to conceal it, (because they're smart enough to realize that it's not well-looked-upon in wider society.)  He's romanticized the idea of being detached and efficient, which is what he thinks of that condition as providing to sufferers.  The (very, very few,) people who are genuinely using a condition like APD to their advantage don't get fired up about it in comboxes, they have better things to be doing.</comment>

<comment>You're right, of course.   Good assessment.</comment>

<comment>I apologize for replying to multiple comments, but you really should review your opinions on sociopaths. It really seems like most of your views stem from watching teenage sociopaths struggle with their inability to feel the same range of emotion they witness in others.The resulting behavioral issues could be compared with black youth lashing out when most of society says their culture, mannerisms, dress, etc are somehow inferior. Same goes for saying someone's inability to feel empathy makes them less-than-human.**I wanted to add that I'm pretty sure it hasn't been established if sociopathy is a result of nature or nurture. There are many ideas that it has a biological origin. Should we simply write them off as inferior stock and do what humanity tends to do in comparable circumstances?**</comment>

<comment>The antisocial Yankees and Yahoos confuse anti-Socialist for antisocial. Then again, they equate Socialism with Communism. Somewhere between Communism and Fascism lies Democratic Socialism; middle ground.  The real issue is that pigeon-holing a candidate is intellectually lazy if not incompetent.  It is telling how the electrical services worker cited in the article sides with Cruz. Republicans in general, especially Conservatives, work against the working class. I wonder if the right wingers would give-back their collective bargaining right  and  social security benefits because big government is to blame for those benefits?</comment>

<comment>Was Robert E. Lee a sociopath?  He could have backed-off when he didn't thereby losing the South to the North. The counterfactual scenario is that the Confederate aristocracy would have survived only to descend economically once cotton and slavery were no longer as profitable. Given that reality and two weakened nations, America may well have been attacked by Britain or France.  The Sociopaths of the South would never have coalesced with the North to defend this nation. The South would join Latin American and the Caribbean; the North would coalesce with Canada. The Mason-Dixon line would be the international border.  We might be better off now if that Britain and France had taken over; both socialistic, intellectual and technological leaders in the free world; with Germany tossed in for good measure. Perhaps the swastika would be flying over the South by now de jure, not de facto.</comment>

<comment>A sociopath, in a very limited definition, is someone lacking empathy.Robert E. Lee was not a sociopath.</comment>

<comment>As you acknowledge - social cohesion is fundamental. Sociopathy is deviant, and I suspect the benefits of it are equalled by the negatives when it comes to their place in a functioning culture.Naturally if you allow narcissists to define the conversation it will be all about them.</comment>

<comment>Terry Xu is the absolute worst sort of muggle.  That's all you really need to know.</comment>

<comment>Sociopathy and impulsivity are not intertwined, at least inherently. There are plenty who simply don't feel the same range of emotion most do. Yet you demonize them in a way you never would with depression or bi-polar disorder.I don't particularly like the idea of APD & Sociopathy being synonymous. I'm aware of what the DSMIV says.</comment>

<comment>The elites hate Trump just as much if not more . Did you not read the NRO story??</comment>

<comment>I did, most of them were really arguments over Trump's tone and nothing substantial.Cruz is an existential threat to the Republican Party and the lobbying class.</comment>

<comment>Cruz doesn't want to be in the elite club of DC he was sent there by the people to fix it not sit their behind closed doors in those smoke filled rooms trying to screw the America people for the 1000's time.</comment>

<comment>That's hilarious. Do you know his background?</comment>

<comment>>Cruz is an existential threat to the Republican Party and the lobbying class.You don't think Cruz is just as much in bed with the lobbyists as any other politician?  Maybe I misunderstand, apologies if so.</comment>

<comment>The NRO stuff is hilarious. "We must save conservatism from all these dirty conservatives."</comment>

<comment>Seems like there's a disconnect. The "elite" conservative pundit class (as opposed to the populist/rabble rouser types) seem to hate Trump more than Cruz. But the actual office holders? The opposite is true - they hate Cruz more than Trump, possibly because they've had to deal with Cruz before.</comment>

<comment>The NRO types fancy themselves as the intellectual leaders of the conservative movement and in that sense I agree that it is fair to characterize them as elites.  But they are basically impotent.  They have practically zero impact on our lives.They are a totally different animal then the crony capitalist elites who have bought our government (Republicans and Democrats) and who are having the country run for their own benefit and at our expense.  Those are the elites that are bending us over.The NRO types hate Trump because he is far from a pure conservative.  The crony capitalist elites hate Cruz because he is a pure conservative.</comment>

<comment>Oh!  He doesn't' love nothing.  Like most politicians he loves himself.</comment>

<comment>He also seems to think that a Christian Theocracy would be the way to go. Genuinely scary guy.</comment>

<comment>Cruz does better than Trump in all the head to head matchup polling vs both Clinton and Sanders.What is your evidence for Trump being more electable?</comment>

<comment>If only he were a natural born citizen, instead of a canadian transplant of doubtful loyalty</comment>

<comment>Cruz is a Texan Cubanadian... he's a Canadian anchor baby who has now renounced his Canadian citizenship... what an ingrate.Cruz should return to his ancestral homeland: Cuba... they need a zealous and ambitious crusader like Rafael Cruz more than we do.</comment>

<comment>I think this is a really bad argument to make.  American politics is obviously in a gutter and so any attack that can cause damage passes in our culture, but Ted Cruz has been a U.S. citizen his entire life and the legal challenges are merely about trying to twist the law to suit an agenda (the more things change, the more they stay the same).Ted Cruz is a pompous a** who would be a terrible president, arguably worse than Donald Trump, no small feat.  But that doesn't excuse using bad arguments to oppose him.</comment>

<comment>Yeah it's a stupid law but its the law and he was not "natural born." Also he really hates America, he says so all the time</comment>

<comment>He only hates some of America.</comment>

<comment>Statisitcally "most" would be the correct answer</comment>

<comment>I hate Cruz as much as the next guy, but that is far from clear cut legally speaking. While the meaning of "natural born" is not clearly defined, I suspect Cruz would be found eligible if push came to shove.</comment>

<comment>Molly Ball, you forgot to ask Amanda Carpenter what she thought of Senator Cruz having slurred DoD Secretary Chuck Hagel.   All she can muster is that working for Cruz was "not boring"?Two other thoughts, Cruz interacting with his adoring votaries means little.  That and a nickle will get you maybe 1/3 of the vote in a national election.Cruz is despised by his colleagues, Republican and Democrat, people he works with day in and day out.   That says volumes, and not in a good way.  Dan</comment>

<comment>Cruz only appeals to the crazies on the political extreme.The sad thing is that he is the result of the Southern Strategy. Decades of pandering to racism and anti-intellectualism have resulted in candidates like him gaining power.It was inevitable. The truth is that the Republican Establishment candidates use issues like racism, religious beliefs, anti gay sentiment, sexism, and social issues as a distraction. Their real agenda is class warfare.Although I don't think that the core GOP base is very bright, I think that even they have come to realize that the Establishment has played them for fools. Hence we see the rise of Trump and Cruz, who have taken up the hateful rhetoric up a few notches. </comment>

<comment>Sounds good except his support is sinking by the week . I guess we are smarter than you give us credit for.</comment>

<comment>How cruelly ironic for him that he timed his strategy down to the election cycle where it was primed to succeed, only to be outdone by someone more bombastic and over the top than he is.(Arguably, he should have made his move in 2012, but still his overall timing and political strategy have been quite effective, especially considering how vapid and intellectually bankrupt his ideas are.  If he waited any longer, he risked the inevitable backlash that his ideas might actually get tried and fail spectacularly.  There's only so much stalling one can do before the people supporting you demand action.)</comment>

<comment>As a Trump supporter - I can join with many who have specific reasons for detesting Ted Cruz.1) He lied about his Goldman Sachs loans. What he CANNOT lie about is the fact that Goldman Sachs is one of his top campaign donors ( also his wife worked there). If you are a Goldman Sachs guy - trying to paint yourself as anti-establishment is obscene and nauseating.2) He has proposed to quadruple the number of H1-B guest worker visas in the Congress - this positions him squarely as an enemy of American workers - Trump is a FRIEND of American workers- the difference could not be more stark.3) Cruz supported the Gang of Eight immigration bill which included amnesty.  Later Cruz, insulted our intelligence by claiming that he was doing some kind of "poison pill".Meaning that he supposedly "opposed" it -by supporting it.This kind of too-clever Harvard lawyer nonsense is something that we had enough of with Bill Clinton and his clever definitions of the words "is" and "sex".</comment>

<comment>you are totally incorrect</comment>

<comment>totally?</comment>

<comment>totally ... that list might possibly apply to Rubio</comment>

<comment>It might also totally apply to Trump.He freely admits that he has engaged in crony capitalism.  He has long been a big supporter of amnesty and mass immigration.  And he has changed his position on any number of issues.  Heck he voted for Barack Obama which does not say much for his judgement.</comment>

<comment>Ah...I suggest you do some research, trump is no savior of the working class. He, in fact, has a history of using hb1 visas to import cheap, unskilled labor to work on his properties.In light of that sticky little reality, do you apply the same level of disdain to trump for his actions?</comment>

<comment>Doesn't sound like you know what you are talking about. 1) H1-B is not an "unskilled" visa.2) Trump is not in the kind of business that typically hires these kinds of workers.Let's see some specific information you have so I can comment more precisely.</comment>

<comment>Trump uses those visas to import his wives and girl friends.</comment>

<comment>"Senator" Cruz claims he will spank his daughters if they lie.

<comment>Strange people to be sure.But you cant throw people in jail just for being intolerable.</comment>

<comment>but you can throw them in prison for:1. Illegal Storage2. Illegal Transmission3. Perjury</comment>

<comment>To be sure.Help me call foul on a supreme court of 8 new york and California jews and catholics.There must be something illegal about that?It does not represent the country.</comment>

<comment>At best, Cruz could win Iowa and some of the red states.  He may not even do that.  He has NO chance in the blue states.  It's over, folks.  Trump is the GOP nominee.</comment>

<comment>Who will take the bull by the horns from the inbred GOP who have conspired for 8 years?</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz's problem, besides looking like a creepy puppet, is that he has zero appeal outside of his narrow focus on the evangelical libertarian tea party types. If he were to win the republican nomination, it will be a Pyrrhic victory </comment>

<comment>You know a guy has to be a first class a-hole when his own party members in Congress hate him so much they are considering backing a whacko like Donald Trump. </comment>

<comment>When your only major accomplishment is holding the full faith and credit of the United states hostage over a dumb political issue, you aren't the person I'm going to vote for</comment>

<comment>Read the Constitution, it is not possible for a Senator (nor anyone in government) to put the full faith and credit of the US at risk.Think please</comment>

<comment>Sure. I guess that government shutdown never happened</comment>

<comment>Government shut-downs have happened lots of times, No impact to Full Faith and Credit.  Again, read something</comment>

<comment>I'm going to posit for a moment that you don't understand how a shutdown is a threat to the full faith and credit of a government. </comment>

<comment>Because it is not.  There is no mechanism for a default, US government debt is guaranteed, there is literally no way not to payoff US government debt.I think that you are confusing authorizing additional debt with paying off existing debt.</comment>

<comment>But that was exactly what was at issue in 2013, the authorizing of payments for debts already accrued. And if we had defaulted on those payments, getting downgraded by the bond people would have been the least of our concerns</comment>

<comment>The bond people know that there is no way to default on US debt.the debate was about raising the debt limit, the risk was to payments outside of the scope of the full faith clause.</comment>

<comment>The 'debate' was about refusing to cover debts in an attempt to fight obamacare. Something that had been voted on, passed through both houses of congress, signed into law, and generally upheld by the Supreme court, which is about as textbook as laws can be.What history are you remembering? Because it sure as s*it ain't the one I lived through </comment>

<comment>dup</comment>

<comment>Again, there is no debate about covering US debt, see 14th amendment, there is no way not to pay authorized debt.The ACA was no textbook law and was by no means through a regular process even through a Democrat controlled house and senate.  the textbook would call for passing identical bills through the house and senate, this never happened because the Dems figured that they couldn't get it through the senate.  I was passed as if it were a budget bill which does not require final passage by the house and senate.On the upside, it can be repealed through a budget reconciliation instead of normal route.posted earlier, apologies if this gets duped.</comment>

<comment>We had to raise the debt limit...... to pay our minimum payments on our credit card.</comment>

<comment>that's not how it works.  Existing debt (principle and interest) can all be paid off without raising debt limits as it is already authorized.More like the bank does not automatically raise your credit card limit when you reach your max.  Arguing that you need that increase to pay minimums would not get you anywhere.</comment>

<comment>It's a kinder, gentler America, now that we're confidently moving forward in the 21st century ... well-informed, truly patriotic  American citizens are forming considered, genuine, and passionately caring relationships with intelligent, compassionate, and genuinely, contemptibly despicable phoaquine gnashshoals.</comment>

<comment>Excellent piece!Cruz 2016!!!</comment>

<comment>You have to know the Republican party is on full retard when a pandering dufus like Cruz seems like a "sane" option to Donald Trump.</comment>

<comment>Neither the pandering dufus Ted Cruz, nor the raging narcissist Donald Trump. </comment>

<comment>all the retards are saying that these days</comment>

<comment>Thanks for representing "all the retards".</comment>

<comment>Pandering is what Trump is doing.  He is reversing his own liberal positions that he has held for decades so that he can spout bombastic stuff that his supporters apparently want to hear and are desperate to believe.He has done it brilliantly but it is the very definition of pandering.</comment>

<comment>Agreed about Trump. Trump is worse about pandering than Cruz.But that does not change the fact that Cruz is a pandering, political opportunist.</comment>

<comment>The constitutional text provides that a president, unlike other elected officials, must be a “natural born citizen.”  This language could not mean anyone born a citizen or else the text would have simply stated “born citizen.” The word “natural” is a limiting qualifierthat indicates only some persons who are born citizens qualify.  Moreover,when the Constitution was enacted, the word “natural” meant something not created by statute, as with natural rights or natural law, which instead were part of the common law. At common law, “natural born” meant someone born within the sovereign territory with one narrow exception.  The exception was for children of public officialsserving abroad, which does not help Cruz because his parents were not servingthe United States when he was born in Canada.</comment>

<comment>What if a presidential candidate was born by Cesarean Section?</comment>

<comment>Give to Caesar what is Caesar's?  Such a person is an automatic citizen of Rome?</comment>

<comment>Fair enough.But Cesarean Section  is not "natural born".</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>Love him! Cruz 2016!!</comment>

<comment>Cruz is a Dominionist who believes he has been ordained by his imaginary friend in the sky to lead the US towards theocracy.</comment>

<comment>Whats that?</comment>

<comment>If evangelicals and libertarians are considered separate from the Tea Party, then it sure seems the tea party wing described in this article only represents anger and nothing else.I think its better to view the GOP like this: you have moderates who are both the Chamber of Commerce variety (aka "the establishment) and libertarians who are essentially CoC types that are socially liberal. Those groups will likely vote with each other. The Tea Party is really a collaboration of evangelicals, hard core libertarians (the type that view tax as extortion), and angry working class folks who don't want to vote liberal for a variety of reasons, whether that be a rage boner over immigration, socially conservative values, or just indoctrination from years of Reagan style political/economic speech (they are still waiting for those trickledowns).So really, its not 4 different groups, its two that could probably reliably be expected to vote cohesively. The rage group probably outsizes the CoC group at this time, so they can get primary wins especially in really rural states, but it sure seems like the CoC group will hand the general to the Democrats if Hillary runs.The real wild card is if Bernie somehow upsets Clinton and the rage vote gets one of their guys in the GOP primary. If that happens I'm pretty sure the moderates in both camps will push for a third party candidate to run, and we'll have a true 3 way blood bath. Unfortunately, a 3 way tilt with the Dems having nominated Bernie is probably the best conditions possible for Cruz/Trump in the general. I think (very unfortunately) that there are more rage type Cruz/Trump people right now in this country then economic populists for Bernie.</comment>

<comment>I've only read the first paragraph of your comment but I think you forgot baked-in racism.</comment>

<comment>That's one of the things they're mindlessly angry about</comment>

<comment>as evidenced with how quickly the tea party has fallen behind Trump even though he has virtually none of their other postions</comment>

<comment>FRAT</comment>

<comment>From what I have read Ted Cruz is intimately involved with far-right Christian Dominionist theology, which would explain why he wants to re-write the Constitution as to impose religious laws. And just recently a video came out of him years ago, basically saying that he wanted to rule the world. Creepy stuff.</comment>

<comment>Have you ever worked for a living?</comment>

<comment>Have you ever engaged in an honest debate, or do you just verbally assault your opponents?</comment>

<comment>Cruz as Christian Messiah?  The Second Coming?  Oy!</comment>

<comment>From Google: Dominion Theology is a theory from the field of Sociology which describes a theocratic ideology which seeks to implement a nation governed by conservative Christians ruling over society based on an understanding of biblical law.Sounds like Christian Sharia.Do you have a link to that video you mentioned?</comment>

<comment>If you think Ted Cruz is nuts, check out his father, Rafael Sr.</comment>

<comment>Are you smart or something?</comment>

<comment>I am aware and informed.</comment>

<comment>He's a preacher man.</comment>

<comment>Yup. A hate preacher. And a birther (oh, the irony).</comment>

<comment>If they can trot out Rev Wright's stuff, we can trot out Rev Cruz's stuff, right?What BS was young Rafael fed?</comment>

<comment>Ted sr. makes rev wright look like mother Teresa in comparison. </comment>

<comment>Really?  I'll Google that... the guy must have left a paper trail.</comment>

<comment>I am pretty sure that William F. Buckley. jr. is spinning in his grave.</comment>

<comment>Who's that?Is he from new york?Never been there.</comment>

<comment>Google the name. He is what used to represent 'true conservatism', and he warned of the far-right taking over his party.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the heads up.But I dont live in a book.I live here and know.</comment>

<comment>Book reading is hard and books contain dangerous information. Good choice.</comment>

<comment>Books do produce lots of BTU's, however.</comment>

<comment>If you want to learn what Republican conservatism is all about, you need to know Buckley.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is a Dominionist. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...  Enough said.</comment>

<comment>He's one of those too?What does that mean?</comment>

<comment>It means that he believes that the world should be governed by a christian theocracy, just like ISIS believes that it should be a muslim theocracy. Same god, same goal, different religion.</comment>

<comment>His father is a nutjob dominionist.Cruz seems to be much more narcissistic.  He's only a dominionist in the sense that he believes that he is as important as God and also believes that he should run the US.  That's not quite the same as believing that God will give dominion to His chosen ruler of the US.</comment>

<comment>Like father like son. Cruz-boy is just better at hiding it.</comment>

<comment>"You've got to remember that these are just simple farmers. These are people of the land. The common clay of the new West. You know... morons."- The Waco Kid</comment>

<comment>I doubt Americans are going to elect a seditionist like Cruz president.</comment>

<comment>What does that mean?</comment>

<comment>Cruz is from Texas, sort of.  Texan politicians are secession-friendly, as a general rule.</comment>

<comment>Seditionist is secessionist.I like that.A country based around new york makes me angry.And new york has been waging culture war against america.</comment>

I live in the Empire State, one of the original 13 colonies.In the US Civil War,  New York reported the most deaths of any state—46,534, according to the 1866 federal report.I love new York, from the New York harbor, to the St. Lawrence Seaway... form Buffalo to Albany... from the Finger lakes, to the Great Lakes... from the Adirondack Mountains, to the Southern Tier... from the Vermont border, to Niagara Falls.Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Nah, he's Canadian—about as Texan as poutine eaten by a Mountie watching a Leafs game.</comment>

<comment>I'd rather eat poutine then mans best friend.</comment>

<comment>The real test is, can Ted skate?  I mean on ice.</comment>

<comment>Alberta has always had a secessionist streak as well (when the price of oil has been high).</comment>

<comment>Ah, Cruz was born in Calgary.  Your problem is now our problem, eh?</comment>

<comment>Cruz is nothing like Goldwater - Goldwater was a psychopath intent on starting World War III his first day in office.  Cruz is, however, exactly like witch hunter general, Senator Joe McCarthy, a self-obsessed sociopath who wallows in the role of demigod.</comment>

<comment>"It seems so phony, so theatrical, so contrived."  Like a tent revival.</comment>

<comment>I dont understand?</comment>

<comment>Cruz is the son of a preacher man.  A chip off the old block. A professional zealot.</comment>

<comment>How is he a zealot any more then your new york pervert agenda?</comment>

<comment>Sir, are you drunk? I respond to reasonable questions, not hate-filled trolling.</comment>

<comment>What a fun read! Molly Ball brings Atlantic Monthly quality to theatlantic.com, as usual.That is all.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz born near the USA, not a natural born citizen. This campaign is a waste, kinda like Ted's senate career.</comment>

<comment>Calgary Ted is not a natural-born citizen. He should self-deport to Canada.</comment>

<comment>I never threatened you.I wish I had a pony too.I wish a lot of things.You're a b1tch.Like every liberal.</comment>

<comment>Nice puff piece.  Focuses on Cruz's tactical mastery.  Too bad he's a craven, lying POS.  Look what he did to Chuck Hagel.  And his flip flopping on immigration.  People who think they could trust Ted Cruz farther than he could be thrown (which isn't very far) are delusional.</comment>

<comment>A multi-millionaire married to a banker from one of the sleaziest financial firms ever to exist is now "a man of the people". Yikes!</comment>

<comment>Don't forget "ivy League educated"</comment>

<comment>His Goldman Sachs ties are a lot more than just that.</comment>

<comment>Right now,  GDP is about $18 trillion per year,  government revenues are about $1 trillon per year, spending is about 1.5 trillion per year, and government debt is about $20 trillion.     If we DON"T cut spending by  33% or more, within 8 years, interest on the debt will be the third highest item on the budget.Senator Cruz realizes we've got to cut SOMETHING, and I''m sure most people agree that ethanol subsidies for farmers are a lot lower spending priority than medicare or VA  benefits.    Donald Trump , in trying to appeal to Iowa voters, doesn't seem to agree with that assessment.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz...World Domination?http://www.mediaite.com/online...</comment>

<comment>You are one grumpy NY er today. Are you snowed in and ran out of bagels?</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz better not have any skeletons in his closet because you can guarantee that one of his many enemies is eager to leak it as soon as it looks like ehe might win.</comment>

<comment>Any non liberal has got all of new york against them.Its an upside.</comment>

<comment>True but it takes some real effort to get all of Congress against you.</comment>

<comment>No it doesn't.You just have to rock the boat.AKA, not under the wing of the RINO establishment.</comment>

<comment>People have been rocking the boat for years.  Cruz is the only one I know of who got all the other 99 senators wet.  That sort of bipartisan hatred is unique. </comment>

<comment>You like it!You love the Ted!</comment>

<comment>I love that he's going to expose the Republican party for what it really is and guarantee that Democrats keep the White House for another 4 years. </comment>

<comment>You've got Ted underoos!</comment>

<comment>When you imply that New York is "against" Ted Cruz, what do you mean?</comment>

<comment>Its a generalization for expediency of language.</comment>

<comment>what does it mean though</comment>

<comment>Jews.  Or gays.  Or liberals.  Or liberal gay Jews.  It always means at least one of those three.</comment>

<comment>Well,thats not nice.But some people might clump those together.</comment>

<comment>What does it sound like it means?</comment>

<comment>vague anti liberal nonsense?</comment>

<comment>A generalization meaning what?</comment>

<comment>Tell me that you dont know what generalization means and I'll slowly explain it.</comment>

<comment>You appear to be confused.  I was not asking you to explain the meaning of the world "generalization," I was asking you to explain the meaning of your (professed) generalization.It is odd that you're so prickly about explaining what you mean.</comment>

<comment>I dont even know what your asking me know,you're fired!</comment>

<comment>I'm asking you what your generalization (as you put it) that New York is "against" Ted Cruz means.</comment>

<comment>The more people see Cruz, the more they do not like him.  He is more like a revivalist preacher.  The guy is very smart, no doubt about it.  He does not have the EQ to be president.</comment>

<comment>How smart are you?</comment>

<comment>Are you for Cruz or what?</comment>

<comment>So by avoiding an answer I can assume dummy?</comment>

<comment>An astute observation.</comment>

<comment>Myeh...Whats astute?Is that like a stick up your butt?</comment>

<comment>Is it wrong to hear Butthead's voice when you ask that question?</comment>

<comment>Your supposed to.</comment>

<comment>He has been steadily climbing in the polls and he beats Hillary in most head to head match up polls.Your observation does not match reality.</comment>

<comment>They're doing their best. . . whoever revealed his loan from Goldman Sachs presumably had that goal in mind. . . but one of the more intriguing aspects of this campaign season is how little voters seem to care about scandals and gaffes.</comment>

<comment>What would happen if everybody never paid new york back?Who would bail you out then?What would you do for a living?</comment>

<comment>Why do you think Trump keeps bringing up '(not) born in the USA'?Trump's trying to tie Cruz's real-life story to the 'real' life story about Obama that the birthers have concocted. If Trump is successful, then the low-information GOP voter will think that 'A vote for Cruz is a vote for Obama'</comment>

<comment>That is a stretch to say the least.</comment>

<comment>The establishment reaction to Cruz indicates just how much they loathe and despise him.  Effectively, they are aiding Trump by staying silent or only criticizing Cruz in the hopes that Trump puts a dagger in Cruz's campaign in Iowa.I don't think the establishment is necessarily resigned to a Trump nomination, though they may be too disorganized and incompetent to stop it.  But it is clear that they are willing to lay off Trump in order to insure that Cruz cannot win the nomination.  Probably smart tactically, since (1) Trump has a higher chance than Cruz of spectacularly blowing up later on in the process; (2) if Trump wins the nomination but loses the general election, they'll be able to make an argument that the party needs establishment control to be successful; and (3) even if Trump becomes president, he will likely be easier for Congress to control, since he's more likely to want to get things done.  The one counterargument against is that Cruz was much less likely to win the nomination even if he won Iowa, so maybe the establishment is overestimating the likelihood of Cruz winning.  Or they just hate the insufferable pr*ck so much they don't really care.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is the butt boy for talk radio panderers and a ideologue. I agree with Dole as he would be worse than Trump. Hopefully Rubio can break through as those two cat- fight.</comment>

<comment>I like his story being from humble beginnings with immigrant parents and self made. I think it gives him the right perspective and empathy for the middle class. His tax proposal is reasonable and helps the middle. He has the foreign policy chops from his time in the Senate and might be the most knowledgeable of anyone running. He is also a true conservative and he has an ability to work across the aisle to get stuff done unlike Cruz. There is a primer for you.</comment>

<comment>He's talk about Rubio, not Cruz.  And we all know that Trump is winning (he doesn't let one forget that).Jack dog, even though I do not share his political views, is a man who thinks for himself and will support who he believes is the best candidate regardless of popularity.  It's a lost art in our current culture.</comment>

<comment>It's a long way to Tipperary</comment>

<comment>Yes lots of miles to go until the convention.</comment>

<comment>Jack, Rubio as president would implement a foreign policy that is dangerous to our long term stability.</comment>

<comment>Where do you live?I dont live in the middle east!What are you some kind of terrorist?</comment>

<comment>Um, northeast USA.  Rubio's an unapologetic neoconservative.  We have witnessed what happens when our collective hubris gets the better of us -- see the Iraq War.  And Rubio hasn't denounced that war even though it's been a disaster for our country.</comment>

<comment>It wasn't a disaster until Obama made it one.</comment>

<comment>Jack, c'mon.  You know that's simply untrue.</comment>

<comment>Up new york way?Fluck you.I dont need your north east filth pushed on my community.</comment>

<comment>Alrighty then.  Have a good day.</comment>

<comment>True, but is there any evidence that Cruz or Trump would be any better?  They also believe in aggressively projecting strength via the military to the point of recklessness.  The only reason Cruz doesn't espouse Rubio's views is that he also believes in criticizing the other side's view to make himself appear stronger, regardless of that view.  Trump is just a wildcard because he doesn't have a coherent foreign policy, unless courting Putin's favor and trying to emulate Soviet Russia counts.Rubio's the most likely of the three to talk tough, but not necessarily act on such tough talk.  Of course, there is always danger in backing yourself into a corner of aggression because of tough talk, so I'm not saying there aren't reasons to be concerned about Rubio's alarmingly bad foreign policy proposals.  It's just that he may be the least shi**y of the three main Republican candidates when it comes to actual implementation of foreign policy.</comment>

<comment>The current President has done just that! Rubio would be a step in the right direction to lead as opposed to follow and abdicate like Obama.</comment>

<comment>Rubio would be a return to the worst excesses of the Bush 43 administration.  And any responsible leader would have to exercise restraint.  There is nothing in Rubio's public statements that even remotely suggests he understands and appreciates that virtue.</comment>

<comment>That's nonsense with no support.</comment>

<comment>Oh, I can back that up, Jack.  It's not that hard.  Will post later and we can argue about it then.</comment>

<comment>"We’ve got to do something different. I think 2016 is like 1980.”This betrays that he's too young to have real first-hand knowledge, as a voting adult, of that election.Reagan was personally appealing.Cruz is personally grating.Cruz is less likeable than Newt Gingrich, and that's quite a feat to pull off.</comment>

<comment>Watching Ted Cruz compare himself to Ronald Reagan makes me want to break something. They have nothing in common except they both called themselves Republicans. Nothing. If he came back today and spoke against Cruz, Cruz would be calling him the establishment and so on and so forth.  </comment>

<comment>Based upon his policies when he was Governor of California?Reagan would never be nominated today.  He'd be dismissed out of hand as yet another RINO.</comment>

<comment>Probably easier to just say "Party continues death spiral."</comment>

<comment>Or the perverts cower in fear.</comment>

<comment>I suppose a very strange person might say something like that.</comment>

<comment>A very strange person might suppose that.</comment>

<comment>The person's username is that of a hijacker (who managed to successfully pull off his heist and get away with plummeting to his death from a great height), so probably shame on you for taking him seriously at all in the first place.</comment>

<comment>But then on the other hand....Everything you need to know about Rafael Edward CruzCruz wrote this article with Paul Ryan extolling the virtues of TPA and TPP:http://paulryan.house.gov/news...What the Conservative treehouse has to say about TPP and Ted:http://theconservativetreehous...Can you handle the truth about Ted Cruz:http://www.dcclothesline.com/2...Why TPP destroys America as we know it:http://www.exposethetpp.org/TP...TED's Pro-Gay agenda:http://www.bloomberg.com/polit...If you are wondering where Trump came up with the "Cruz is Nasty" bithttp://www.nytimes.com/2016/01...</comment>

<comment>Flagged for spam.  You're wasting your time on the Atlantic.  None, or close to it, of its readership is planning to vote for Cruz anyway.  Go spam Breitbart and Stormfront, they might actually care about your drivel.</comment>

<comment>STOP harrassing me. I have notified the sys op of your harrasement and sent a link of your comment. I have asked to the sys op to take action against you.</comment>

<comment>Someone with "standing" needs to bring the matter of  defining a "natural born citizen" to the USSC now... not after Cruz is elected POTUS.BHO was born on US soil, so the citizenship of his parents was always irrelevant in regards to his eligibility for POTUS.Cruz was born in Calgary Canada and is/was a natural born, juris soli, Canadian citizen.  Cruz has renounced his Canadian citizenship.Oddly, his mother's US citizenship does not entitle him to automatic US citizenship. From what I have read,  if his father was a US citizen, Cruz would have some legal precedent and settled  law to claim status as a natural born US citizen. There is still residual male-supremacy in these dusty old laws.</comment>

<comment>I have heard arguments both ways.   I think if a couple is traveling on vacation and has a baby abroad, it is one thing.  In this case the child is a US citizen eligible to run for POTUS.  When a mother moves to another country and plans to become a citizen of that country, and raises her child as a citizen of that country, only later to change her mind and move back to the US, then it is a different matter.  Now, I do think this makes Trump look very good when he forced Obama to provide to the public his birth certificate.  Trump has been vindicated on all fronts.</comment>

<comment>"Someone with "standing"..."Like a supreme court of 8 new york and california jews and catholics?Do it!I want you to do it.I dare you monkey boy!</comment>

<comment>monkey boy, monkey boy!</comment>

<comment>Sir, we are all just hominids on a mudball, going with the flow.</comment>

<comment>Sir, you are sounding like a 19th century KKK Grand Wizard.</comment>
