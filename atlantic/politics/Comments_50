<comment>Women have historically been better leaders than men. For example, Queen Hatshepsut of Ancient Egypt is recognized as one of the greatest Pharaohs, uniting Egypt and ushering in an era of untold peace, prosperity, and monument building.Numerous studies have found companies with a larger proportion of women on their boards of directors perform better. As for countries with women leaders, one only need look to Thatcher or Merkel. Women leaders have most recently been elected in S. Korea, Taiwan, Poland, among others.</comment>

<comment>Absolute nonsense.There are tons of women in power who have been useless, if not downright bad.Funny how the article is written in the context of Hillary Clinton, who is mentioned 3 timesNo mention of Carly Fiorina, running for the other sideAnd frankly, Fiorina has a lot more experience in management and leadership that Clinton does.Sounds more like a propaganda push for Hillary masquerading as a term paper.</comment>

<comment>You are an idiotIf women were better leaders then they would be in the lead</comment>

<comment>Well according to the feminists, their ability to lead has been undermined by being victimized by the Patriarchy.All the while forgetting, that women always had power over men.And even today, feminists, hypocrites that they are,  have no problems using the old rule of "Men propose, women dispose."Except now, if men dare to propose, they are evil and sexist, and if men decide not to propose, they they are wusses.</comment>

<comment>Why you'd mention Merkel in the same comment you claim women make better leaders is baffling.  The mass sexual assaults in Cologne are a direct result of the immigration policy that is crushing her approval ratings and generating violent protests.</comment>

<comment>That's sarcasm I assume.</comment>

<comment>Dear Katrin,I enjoyed reading your article, and you are raising a valid question in that we should use gender-based stereotyping about 'generic' gender-associated behavior patterns in any 'a priori' fashion without checking them on real data.However, as for the example you are quoting, medieval female rulers, in order to reject any form of statistically significant difference in average levels of, say, 'agressiveness' between female and male political behavior - I have to unfortunately argue, that your argument there is empty, as it rests on 2 fallacies: 1) invalid generalization to the very large group of all females based on a very small sample size (medieval female rulers - sample size is order of 100 ... 1000, while the group of all females is billions), and 2) it is invalid to argue from correlation toward causation ('correlation is not causation').As for 1), the point should be obvious in statistics: the working paper by Dube and Harish you are quoting reports 27 % higher likelihood to wage war among a set of medieval female rulers compared to the contemporary male counterparts. The data set on which this shift of average is based contains maybe a 1000 women. But the total set of all women numbers in the billions, of course. So, the reported shift of the average is based on a sample set of VERY small relative size. It is well known in statistics that averages based on small sample size (here, of medieval female rulers) are subject to large random fluctuations compared to the true average based on a much larger total set (here, of all women). Hence, it is completely unjustified to generalize the 27% shift reported in the working paper by Dube and Harish to a generic statement about the political behavior patterns of women in general - if at all, the effect found there is most likely an effect of small-sample bias. No conclusions should be based therefore on the reported effect.As for 2): Even taking the result of the small sample of the working paper at face value - what does it say? It states a correlation: Between a medieval leader being either male or female, and the average relative likelihood to have waged war. Correlation, however, does not imply causation - which is, however, what you were implicitly assuming when you argued that it must now be done to females 'per se' not having less inclination toward aggressive political behavior than males (or having even slighly more such inclination, based on reading the working paper data as describing "causation"). The working paper only describes a correlation among members of a small sample set. To sharpen the point - let me propose an alternative causation hypothesis, which equally well explains the correlation, but based on just the data and its correlation in the working paper, can not be discriminated from your own hypothesis. Namely, let me propose, that the effect of small-sample size described in 1) effectively acted as a sociological and behavioral filter: a) the European middle ages were a collection of societies which were on average completely dominated by a male power hierarchies, and a patriarchal system subordinating women on average at every stage to male power. b) the behavior of the dominating male half of medieval societies was, on average, quite strongly controlled by aggressive behavioral patterns, whether in daily live, or in politics - as any look into medieval history will immediately confirm. c) just presume for the sake of the argument, that there were an innate difference between the levels of aggressiveness in social and political behavior between women and men *on average*. Now take a woman who as you described came into a ruling position by virtue of being in the line of succession in a noble ruling family. On average, all the surrounding other dominions would have been ruled by men in those times. Let us presume that the female ruler under discussion, having been drawn randomly, sits close to average female behavioral pattern structure (as would be the most likely, all other factors being the same) - then by virtue of assuming c), she would be out of herself, all other factors being the same and in the absence of any external forcing, be on average less inclined to aggressive political behavior than the on average male rulers of the surrounding dominions. What is the chance, given that she followed such an innate less aggressive inclination, that she might survive long in her ruling position, given on average aggressive challenges from the other rulers, and potentially, also succession challenges from, say, male relatives in her own noble family? Almost none. Hence, if this female ruler had any ambition to stay in power for a while, she would necessarily find herself forced to adopt the ruling aggressive behavioral patterns of her age, imposed by largely male group of contemporaneous rulers. She would have to dissimulate herself to a certain extent. And maybe even more so, given the on-average male-female subordination hierarchy of medieval society, she might have to be even more aggressive than the other male rulers were on average - just to survive in her ruling position. As you see, the combined effects of small sample size (being member of small group of medieval female rulers), and overwhelming societal and political behavioral pressure from the largely male-dominated society as well as group of contemporary rulers could have very plausible forced medieval female rulers to deploy a level of political aggressiveness even higher than the average of their male counterparts - just for reasons of survival.It is crucial to note that I am saying "could". Because the point of 1) and 2) really is - my hypothesis above and your hypothesis in the article - they constitute quite different causes of the observed 27% shift among medieval female rulers. But, they cause the SAME correlation in the data, and because of 1) (small sample size) this correlation cannot at all discriminate between your and my hypothesis.In my opinion, it is crucial to point this out, as the confusion of correlation with causation, and the neglect of small-sample-size bias, can lead to gross misperceptions of a given subject matter by the public. If you agree on this, and on the above arguments, then it is because of this, that I would like ask you to issue a correction to your article, essentially stating that the conclusions/generalization you are drawing from your discussion of the example of medieval female rulers are unjustified because the available data only allows for the observation of a quite interesting correlation, while not being able to distinguish different possible causes of the correlation.Best regards,Alex</comment>

<comment>Inane rambling. The author of the above article is a professor, specializing in Medieval Europe, and she backed up her analysis with sufficient peer reviewed sources and criticism....unlike you.</comment>

<comment>Dear Arcite,I was not arguing the validity or quality of the sources, nor the qualifications of the article's author. I was pointing to a problem with generalizations drawn from small-sample-size statistics, and with reasoning based on the "correlation implies causation" fallacy.Best,Alex</comment>

<comment>I was actually withholding judgement on your comment up until you used the all time feminist's favorite term 'patriarchy'. That was when I realized it was just another feminist propaganda piece not worthy of any further attention. LOL.</comment>

<comment>I don't judge Clinton's policies by her gender, but by her stated preferences, her choice of advisors, and her past choices. Based on these, she's too hawkish for my tastes. But if the person she runs against is even more hawkish than her, she may yet get my vote. </comment>

<comment>What a silly article. I've never heard of the stereotype of women being hawkish. I've heard of the opposite dovish stereotype (often from women or male supporters of women political candidates). And I've heard of individual women described as hawks (Clinton, Thatcher, etc) but never women in general. The whole premise seems based on a straw-woman.The article's own evidence from the study by Dube and Harish seems to suggest that women leaders are indeed more hawkish. So the general stereotype that they are dovish might not only be false but opposite from reality. The author wants to say that not all women are hawkish but again, who is saying that all are? It's certainly interesting that historically in the European context they tended to be more belligerent or warmongering.And this passage needs correction."Similarly, notions about male aggression also endure: Ted Cruz, for example, challenged Donald Trump to debate him “mano-a-mano,” implying that real men face each other head-to-head."The phrase "mano-a-mano" doesn't mean "man to man" as popular thinking suggests. It means "hand to hand".</comment>

<comment>People actually think it means man-to-man?</comment>

<comment>A great many people do.Remember that to a lot of anglos, taking an english word and sticking an "o" to it, is conversion into a "latino" formMan --> Mano</comment>

<comment>I always kind of thought that was a parody-o.</comment>

<comment>LOLIt is indeed a parody-o based on reality-o..I have seen that happen repeatedly in South and Central America with tourists who have no or minimal Spanish skills</comment>

<comment>Also, "brother" in Spanish is "hermano," sometimes shortened to 'mano--like 'bro.'  "Hey, what's up 'mano?"  If you don't know that it comes from hermano, it's easy to think that means "what's up man?"  Ergo, mano a mano=man to man.(To be fair, Sjursen never said it meant "man to man," just that it implied that "real men face each other head-to-head.")</comment>

<comment>Have to agree with you on this one..</comment>

<comment>Toughness and hawkishness are not the same. I've heard of the stereotype of successful women being tough (and also "b*tchy") but never hawkish.</comment>

<comment>Good article. My go to in discussions about powerful medieval women is Matilde Canossa. </comment>

<comment>Anybody that doubts that women can be just as hateful, war mongering, anti-social, intolerant, unsympathetic, an debased as men is simply delusional.  These are traits shared by people of all races and both genders.</comment>

<comment>'Politically active women thrived in the Middle Ages—as queens, duchesses, countesses, and so on—because the medieval period seated political power within noble families, and women were members of those families.''...noble wives in the Middle Ages were regarded as co-rulers of territory, alongside their husbands, and were expected to participate in both political and military affairs even when their husbands were present and available.''...queens were 27 percent more likely than contemporary kings to wage war. Further, these were foreign wars, in which the queens went on the offensive.'Thank you! I've heard for decades from rabid feminists about how women are more dovish than men, that men didn't allow women to hold positions of political power, etc. This directly contradicts all those decades of feminist propaganda BS. Thank you!</comment>

<comment>Exactly.  The writer ignores that claims that women can be as or more hawkish than men arose to rebut claims by feminists that women are uniquely compassionate and pacifist, that men and 'testosterone poisoning' are responsible for all war, etc.  It was feminists who claimed 'add women, change everything.'The writer's argument that women are flawed individuals, just as capable of war, aggression, etc. as men, is a strong critique of a wide swathe of feminism.  From this article you'd think that men, e.g. Steven Pinker, were the only people who ever stereotyped women as uniquely conciliatory and empathic.</comment>

<comment>I'm not writing clearly today.  The way I see it the author is claiming the dialectic went like this:World: We have stereotypes about women leaders: some of us think they are unduly hawkish, others unduly dovish.Author: Not so, women are complex individuals.Whereas I see the dialectic as having gone like this:World: We haven't thought much about women leaders; some might be good, some bad, just like men.Feminists: Women leaders would be awesome, they are compassionate, unwarlike, and would fix all the problems men caused!HIstorians: Actually, women leaders in history have been quite warlike.Author: All this stereotyping of women is wrong, women are complex individuals.The author is like the teacher who comes along when Johnny, having been picked on all day, finally hits back, and says "stop fighting you two."  Feminists spun up a false story about women, historians offered a necessary corrective, and then the author accuses both parties of stereotyping women.  It does matter who's doing the stereotyping.</comment>

<comment>What's your basis of disagreement?  Bogeymen is your word, but it's beyond question that feminists have advanced the myth that women leaders are/would be uniquely compassionate and unwarlike.</comment>

<comment>You had me at 'Petronilla of Grandmesnil'.</comment>

<comment>Why stop at the Middle Ages? Lets go back to the Aeneid for a prime example, Dido.Dux femina erat.</comment>

<comment>The female relatives of Alexander the Great strove right along with the men to take control of his empire when he died. And almost everyone of them ended up just as dead.</comment>

<comment>Yeah that didnt turn out well for anyone involved...</comment>

<comment>"Will a woman in the White House mean the United States will lose its edge, become appeasing and weak abroad"Well, considering Obama already did that I'll quote Hillary and ask "what difference does it make"?</comment>

<comment>Hillary is hawkish. Maybe not the most hawkish, but not the least either.Sure, there's plenty of people out there that will dismiss and debase her because of her sex. However, there's plenty not to like when you look at her substance as a leader. Just like all of the remaining candidates.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz, for example, challenged Donald Trump to debate him “mano-a-mano,” implying that real men face each other head-to-head.)"Mano a Mano" is Spanish and means "hand to hand". Mano is from Latin "manus" for hand (odd fact: the word is feminine) and it has zilch to do with English "man".</comment>

<comment>What is hard to find in history are good examples of women mentoring other women in positions of leadership.</comment>
