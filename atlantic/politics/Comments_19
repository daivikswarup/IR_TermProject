<comment>Dear Baby Jesus...Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Funny we both started our comments out the same.</comment>

<comment>Thank you Jesus! Get him out of here. He single-handedly ruined this election by placing himself above the party in attacking Rubio. There is now no clear alternative to Trump and likely won't be before Super Tuesday. Like Rubio or not the field needed to be winnowed in order to beat Trump and Rubio was the best shot at that. Unlike what the candidates say, not everyone running on the GOP side is better than the Democratic candidate.In case we are unsure what really is at stake here it is this: If Bernie and Trump are nominated and Bloomburg runs, Trump will win the Presidency. Quite frankly regardless if no one runs third party, if Trump wins the nomination it is entirely too close to him winning even if he loose the general election. Right now the goal should be defeating Trump, the GOP can worry about defeating whoever the Democrats nominate later. The field needs winnowed before Super Tuesday. We have no one to blame but the self serving Christie that it isn't winnowed more as a result of the NH Primary. In the next 3 weeks there are only 3 days of voting before a full third of the delegates are assigned, if Kasich, Cruz, and Bush stay as tight as they are through each of those primary days we are screwed.After this evening Christie and Rubio must drop out. Unfortunately for Rubio Christie couldn't handle being a loser by himself.</comment>

<comment>"Not everyone on the GOP side is better than the Democratic candidate"?  Try "not a single one of them is better than a Democrat"...particularly if Sanders wins the nomination, as appears more and more likely each day.And by the way, you don't have to worry about Trump winning the election, because Sanders will flatten Trump like a steamroller.  Think about it: Sanders is the ONLY candidate, of either major party, who is both accurately framing the issues as they actually exist, and proposing targeted solutions that go right to the heart of the matter(s).  It will be Sanders' agenda to rescue our democracy from the clutches of the oligarchs and robber barons...versus Trump's fevered delusions about building a wall along the Mexican border, the phantom "Muslims" in Hoboken who cheered on 9/11, and a return to torture as official government policy.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is still losing and only a handful of Negros has cast a ballot....</comment>

<comment>what an incredibly ugly and racist comment</comment>

<comment>Racist?  Its a factual observation based on the demographics of the 2 states that have held elections and Hillarys strength with that missing segment.</comment>

<comment>You're wrong Bill.  Clinton has more support from black voters whereas Sanders has the vote from YOUNG voters.  People under the age of 35, of any ideology left of center, support Sanders.  People older than that, and especially black and women voters, tend to gravitate towards Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Exactly my point Milo, black voters (they prefer Negro now) have not voted and Hillary is leading the delegate count...Bernie is done....</comment>

<comment>Negros?what is this 1930?</comment>

<comment>No, its 2016 post Superbowl Beyonce.....</comment>

<comment>oh the horror a black woman!head for the hills!</comment>

<comment>She should invest in a mirror.........</comment>

<comment>She sort of brought the term back into vogue with a national audience.</comment>

<comment>Who are you dragging behind YOUR pickup?</comment>

<comment>Now - who do you think might be funding Christies campaign and sicking him on the completion?</comment>

<comment>We should lose one of the Rubio, Bush, Kasich group after SC. They've all had at least 1 good primary. Rubio could probably survive a single digit loss more than the others...</comment>

<comment>Christie was such an idiot. Had he left Rubio alone, Bush would have come in 5th. This would have caused Bush's money men to ditch him, leaving Christie with the spot. Now bush gets to stay in the race a little longer.</comment>

<comment>Great strategy and I think you're 100% correct. However, his thinking doesn't seem to be that elevated. He just reminds me of an overage thug.</comment>

<comment>PLUS, he made it so easy for Cruz, who has less experience in government than Rubio! Cruz sailed through the debate unscathed after he sabotaged Carson's campaign in Iowa. It was obviously personal. Hope it was worth it to him.</comment>

<comment>Mabye when Rubio and Christie drop out Kaish will have a chance.</comment>

<comment>Maybe Bush promised him the VP slot.... or maybe he was just dumb enough to think that attacking the guy in 3rd or 4th place was really gonna help him...</comment>

<comment>Easy to say in hindsight.  Christie was shooting for a #2 or #3; it was a long shot, but he knew that he would have been in the long tail of nothingness if he stayed quiet.  Also, the establishment money might very well have gone to Rubio but for the Christie-caused robo-meltdown.</comment>

<comment>His ego is too large for him to present a measured and realistic message. He really came across like a bully and just like in 2012, did far more damage to the Republican Party than any one candidate--he needs to go back to NJ and clean up the many messes he's made there.</comment>

<comment>You should look at the comments on his Facebook page, I think he is quickly becoming the most hated fellow in the Republican Party.</comment>

<comment>I just did and same thing on every kind of social media...plus I've learned of current scandals/misappropriations of funds and stealing from NJ residents. Unbelievable.</comment>

<comment>He always was! Only liberal media love him because he is one of them - government employee, lawyer, big brother, shill for pentagon, etc</comment>

<comment>You're so right, and the best thing you can do is make sure no conservative becomes tarnished by becoming a government employee.</comment>

<comment>you mean ever? like not even President?</comment>

<comment>partisan prejudices are what they are, I have nothing to do with it</comment>

<comment>Hated him. Always. But what was up with his hamfisted unnecessary attack on legalized cannabis? Totally alienated a small portion of moderates who probably would've gone his way. He worked that sawhorse since the start...with no takers. What a loser.</comment>

<comment>Hamfisted? I think you might be confused with the fact that he was holding ham in his fists, as he would normally do on any given day.</comment>

<comment>Go home.Call Obama.Give him another hug.</comment>

<comment>He spent all of the last 2 weeks out of NJ, ignoring the state's problems in his futile pursuit of the nomination. He also used up any remaining credibility as Governor by moving so far to the right and disavowing many of his previous, somewhat more moderate, positions.</comment>

<comment>"2 weeks?" ... more like 1.5 years "out of NJ, ignoring the state's problems"...</comment>

<comment>New Jersey's main problem is too many guineas.</comment>

<comment>N.J. is proud of our Italian Americans.. very proud.. but not Chris Christie ( who btw is only half Italian).</comment>

<comment>Rumor on the street is that Christie is dropping out and going to run for President of the National Anorexic Society.</comment>

<comment>The back of his neck looks like a pack of hot dogs.</comment>

<comment>It's over Christie Creme! </comment>

<comment>He's so fat that his clothes get worn out from the INSIDE.</comment>

<comment>Great Day In The Morning!!!   Hallelujah!!  The air literally smells fresher already.  Decent people everywhere can finally breathe a little easier, knowing for SURE that this giant COCKROACH will NEVER have the chance to do to this country what he's done to my state for the last six years.  Now we can finally proceed with the deadly-serious business of getting him indicted, tried, convicted, disbarred, disgraced, and jailed.  Good riddance, Piggy!  We'll be seeing you back home REAL soon.   Bye now.</comment>

<comment>Well, you've had a Gay American, a Goldman-American and a traffic-conehead. Who's next?</comment>

<comment>Killary lost.Chrisco and Killary both waddle home as losers tonight.</comment>

<comment>OMG have you rejoined us at last, Killary Clottin'!?</comment>

<comment>How do you plan to celebrate?</comment>

<comment>By idly speculating how long it'll take you to get banned again. But it's nice to see a familiar face.</comment>

<comment>I don't know you.   Have we even found common ground in the past?</comment>

<comment>What a weak comment!</comment>

<comment>Killary is a weak candidate.</comment>

<comment>Well, he's all yours now, New Jersey!  Next "campaign" stop: Trenton State Prison!</comment>

<comment>Dude! Atlantic! Nobody cares about Chris Christie except left leaning journalists. Just slink away already </comment>

<comment>So what kind of Ben and Jerry's ice cream do you think Chris Christie is?  Chocked full of nuts and prunes.</comment>

<comment>All of them.</comment>

<comment>Whatever kind it is, it's completely gone, the whole gallon tub.</comment>

<comment>Well Gov.  Lets tell it like it is.  You made a mess in NJ and abandoned us for your egotistical ambitions.  Time to pack it in and go home.  Just not to NJ.  Please please please do us a favor and pull a Palin:  just resign.</comment>

<comment>Well on the bright side, Chris Christie's campaign was more successful than his Lap Band surgery.</comment>

<comment>Don't let the door hit you on your rather wide @$$ on the way out, you POS.I'm sorry, did I say that out loud?  Since I'm a long-suffering resident of NJ, I'm sure you can excuse my outburst.The upside of Christie's flaming out means that I can p!ss all over the grave of his ambitions; the downside is that he'll be back in NJ full time.  I'm willing to take one for the team, however, to ensure that he can't fnck up the rest of the US the way he has NJ.  You're welcome, America.</comment>

<comment>I hope you don't commute over any NJ bridges.</comment>

<comment>I don't see why candidates like Christie and Carson come to believe that they stand a chance. Is it ego? Opportunism? They seem unable to see themselves as others see them.</comment>

<comment>Like a Bridge Over Troubled Waters, Christie can lay him down.</comment>

<comment>In Christie's defense, many Republicans all but begged him to get in the race in 2012. It's strange all that support vanished in just 4 years.</comment>

<comment>He is an egregiously flawed candidate, lacking the temperament for the presidency. (He suffers badly in a comparison with Obama as a steady hand.) Even without Bridgegate, it was going to be a VERY heavy lift. Now it is out of the question.</comment>

<comment>He's not running against Obama.  I don't think he suffers badly in comparison with the rest of the GOP field, though.</comment>

<comment>I meant that after eight years of "No Drama Obama" the nation may not be in the mood to be led by a loudmouthed bully from New Jersey. Or one from New York for that matter.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps. But I was just making the point that Christie's campaign was credible, compared to the competition in the field. I don't think his apparent belief that he could win over the primary voters totally unrealistic.</comment>

<comment>It was "credible", perhaps, but it is also just about over. I never thought he had a chance myself.</comment>

<comment>The GOP was trying to consolidate around an anti-Trump candidate in Rubio. Christie suicide bombed that whole effort. Now the anti-Trump forces have to regroup in South Carolina. I don't think there's time to stop this from happening. What a mess.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure who Christie thought he was helping when he went suicidal on Marco.... Bush seems to have benefited the most, maybe a VP slot ?</comment>

<comment>I've heard people speculate that he thinks he could be AG in a Trump administration. Whatever it is, that floating fat man's antics in NH may have lasting effects on the body politic for decades. A Trump nomination means the end of the GOP as the party that aspires to be for liberty and small government, and means that we have a socialist party on the left and a populist / nationalist party on the right.</comment>

<comment>Oh no.PLEASE not that!When he was the US Attorney for New Jersey his unethical conduct got him in trouble with the DOJ.</comment>

<comment>Carson, Fiorina and Christie should all drop out of the race.</comment>

<comment>I don't see Cruz scooping up Carson supporters if he drops out.  (:-)</comment>

<comment>Candidates don't drop out because of bad poll numbers. They drop out when their campaigns run out of money. But bad poll numbers make it hard to keep raising money.</comment>

<comment>OTOH, money guarantees nothing. Case in point : Jeb in NH.</comment>

<comment>Jeb needed a strong showing to keep his donors happy. If he had lost to Rubio and came in single digits again, I'm sure the money men would stop writing checks. A fourth place showing isn't great either. But at least he can make a case that it's better for them to keep donating to him instead of switching to Rubio. And with Christie close to dropping out, his only real competition for the establishment folks is Kasich. Assuming Rubio doesn't recover, I predict we'll see Bush attacking Kasich.</comment>

<comment>Silly me - I thought candidates dropped out because they didn't get votes.</comment>

<comment>Then tell us why Jeb Bush didn't drop out after Iowa. As long as you have money to burn, you can run for as long as you want. And what does Jeb care? It's not his money that he's wasting.</comment>

<comment>For most politicians votes = money. In Jeb's case it is a matter of entitlement and pride.</comment>

<comment>Tell me how votes equals money. Are voters being bribed into voting for a candidate?</comment>

<comment>He may have given up the race for POTUS - but he will never give up the fight to get Bruce Springsteen's love.</comment>

<comment>I can hear Mitt Romney laughing. Christie, after all, is the guy who gave a keynote address more about himself than Romney and then gave Obama a great photo-op right before the election.If Christie does finally drop out, one thing's for sure. He can resume eating again.</comment>

<comment>I dislike Christie - but I am shocked at all the progressives who are fat-shaming on this thread.I am going to reserve this post for people to reply with their apologies for fat-shaming Christie.</comment>

<comment>It's OK to fat shame a Republican.</comment>

<comment>I apologize for fat-shaming Christie.He's still a POS.</comment>

<comment>No fat presidents! And no more gay presidents.</comment>

<comment>Oh lord.Nobody is trying to 'shame' him. Nobody is trying to make him feel bad, in that sense.It's a common sense observation. If he has such little self control when it comes to what he puts in his own mouth, how the f--k can he be trusted with the highest authority in the country?</comment>

<comment>Christie's campaign was always an example of unabashed narcissism. Okay, maybe all presidential campaigns are. Still, what made this guy look at the polls and measure his competition and ever think he had a shot?Maybe because he did measure his competition and the thought it was lacking? Any good competitor has to have a firm grasp of his own limitations. He seems to lack that insight.</comment>

<comment>Trump lacks the same.</comment>

<comment>Oh yeah, but it hasn't bitten him in the ass yet.</comment>

<comment>Christie didn't have a "unique selling point" in this cycle.  In 2012, he could arguably have gone for the "moderate" angle, but this time out he had to contend with Jeb! and Kasich for the "moderate" mantle.But, basically, he suffered from the same mental disorder as, e.g. "Bobby" Jindal:  looking in the mirror one day and saying to himself, "You know, I could *totally* be President!  I mean, how hard can it be?"</comment>

<comment>Exactly. I always wondered how Newt could look in the mirror and say, "Now there's a guy who should be president."</comment>

<comment>So long, Fatso.</comment>

<comment>He's a shoo-in for the role of "Ralph" in "The Honeymooners" reboot.</comment>

<comment>Come on, he got almost twice as many votes as Carly Fiorina!  They love him in NJ--he has a 35% favorability rating!</comment>

<comment>Dropping out of the race -- that's a true Republican tide that will lift everybody's boat -- AND make room in the tent.</comment>

<comment>A good night for Christie: he all but wrecked Rubio's chances.  And if he gets out of the race, an even better night for him.  Though one could heartily wish for some real knock down drag out adolescent trash talk between Trump and Christie to liven up the future Republican Your Mama Debate Society.  It would be a deal the American viewing public could not refuse.</comment>

<comment>christie's campaign approach is to act like a wisecracking jerk. that is what came across to me in the new hampshire debates, especially with regard to his remarks that were directed at rubio. it just has an obnoxious, sophomoric feel to it; the kind of thing that i used to see back when i was in high school. obviously, it is what new jersey voters like since christie won 2 terms, but then, that's new jersey...</comment>

<comment>The only thing Chris Christie did that was admirable was to call out Marco the robot on his scripted speeches! He himself is nothing more than a bully in reality and he is not loved by all in New Jersey as much as he likes to think he is. People haven't forgotten the bridge gate issue and his not taking care of the people after the Sandy disaster. So for all his big talk of how great a governor he has been while looking into the camera that has done him no favors. So it's bye bye Chris you can go back to being a bully now when being interviewed your time is done on the campaign trail. Ben Carson needs to go as well. What an embarrassment he has been! Standing in the wings like a store front dummy with hands folded even after being told to go on the stage in the last debate. Fiorina can join Carson they both have had their day in the sun. No one will miss any of them least of all me.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie lost the Repubican nomination the second he thanked the President for Federal assistance after Hurricane Sandy.  He didn't realize he was supposed to put American lives ahead of the Republican Party.After that, he made tons of missteps and would never had won - either.  But he had zero chance from then on.</comment>
