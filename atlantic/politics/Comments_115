<comment>I give credit to the Atlantic for an even-handed assessment of the situation in Flint.As I suspected, the local, state and Federal governments ALL fouled up here horribly.The foul-up was bipartisan.If you were to look, OTOH, at the Michael Moore propaganda on this - he ONLY focused on the governor - who conveniently happens to be a Republican.All three levels of government must have consequences for this major fustercluck.</comment>

<comment>The governors office solely made the decision to move the water source from the lake to the river and was responsible;e for making sure that the change was safe.  An environmental panel had already rejected it as not being safe and the Governor's office rejected that decision and did it anyway.  Quite trying to spread blame around.  This happened because a Republican governor wanted to save money by ignoring environmental and safety regulations.  Now after he begged the feds for help, he wants to tell the EPA it's none of their business and he can't seem to admit that this will cost his state billions of dollars of additional spending that will mandate tax increases.</comment>

<comment>Look at Obama's EPA. It sure looks like they sat on the results. Please don't be a partisan hack.</comment>

<comment>If the EPA bears any fault it is because the Federal government has a duty, responsibility and authority to supersede state and local authority and policy decisions and didn't use it's power to the extent that was necessary.  Blaming the EPA is admitting that the EPA has supreme authority, not locally elected leadership.  You can't do one without the other.And by the way, the EPA's faults lie not in creating this problem but not sounding alerts sooner.  My statement stands.  The problem was CREATED by the governor, no one else.  </comment>

<comment>It wasn't created by the governor. He inherited when the good people of Flint couldn't make plans that every normal city in America is able to make. And then their good friends in Detroit sold them up the river.And btw, sounding the alarm is the easiest thing to do. Actually fixing the problem is hard. So if you bungle a SIMPLE task, that's even worse. I have a certain amount of sympathy for the leadership of Flint, caught in a tax-driven death-spiral. Of course it's hard to solve problems when you don't have money. But putting out a warning takes only time.</comment>

<comment>Nice, blame the victims.  The people  and leadership in Flint are not at fault here. The state took over the town because allegedly the local elected leadership was not competent enough to manage their own city.  The state was in charge for the terrible decision to change the drinking water source decision and the decision to not properly process the water.  That's the scandal here.  Anything else is an attempt to help the governor avoid blame for terrible policy decisions.  The man should be impeached if he doesn't resign.  The decision to change the drinking water source will now end up costing billions of dollars for the people of Michigan, and probably the people of all the US since now the federal government has to intervene.  This was the definition of poor leadership on the part of the governors office all in the name of saving money and avoiding "bureaucratic red tape" involved in properly processing and testing the pipes and water.</comment>

<comment>I'm not blaming the victims. If they had prepared adequately-- as 99.9% of the municipalities in this great country do-- they wouldn't need some rush judgement.</comment>

<comment>You are blaming the residents of Flint for what the State did.The city had prepared a study in 2011 detailing what was required to use river water in order to meet minimum standards set by both the EPA and the MDEQ. The Emergency Manager ignored that report. Thus, there was an outbreak of Legionnaire's Disease as well as the lead poisoning.River water was a poor source as it was acidic and had a lot of decomposing material in it. Unless that was cleaned properly, the water would have a disagreeable taste. It would also corrode the pipes. GM changed their water supply shortly after the city went to river water as it was causing corrosion problems in their plant.</comment>

<comment>They should have started it long before the EM was appointed. Many cities have 20 and 30 year plans for building water infrastructure.</comment>

<comment>So what? Most cities in America have the same problem as Flint. Lead in the pipes. And no, these cities aren't racing to replace those pipes.Over time, the minerals in the water have coated the insides of the pipes. Most of them are over 100 years old and still working just fine. There is no reason to replace them.That though is why the EPA and MDEQ have set standards and regulations as to how water is to be treated. Supplies that are acidic have to be buffered to increase the pH.</comment>

<comment>no. the Emergency Manager went along with local progressive politicians who wanted a jobs program.https://reason.com/blog/2016/0...</comment>

<comment>Funny how Republicans are all about "accountability" when it's a city's budget deficit, but when it comes to their silly private sector business manager scheme and miserably cruel and incompetent governor it's everyone else's fault. There's nothing in the article you post that is anywhere near dispositive, I see no proof that Snyder's dictator listened to anyone, just an anonymous "source" that said something terribly vague about "local politicians". I can, however, be absolutely sure that when GM complained to the Governor's office that the tap water was CORRODING THE METAL IN THEIR CARS, $100 million showed up pretty quick to reconnect the factory to Lake Huron.Your problem is that you think Benghazi is a scandal, which has made you completely forget what a real scandal actually looks like.</comment>

<comment>The true problem is liberal retards like you who ignore the fact that 4 Americans were killed by a terrorist attack that Obama and Hillary blamed on a video. And to dispute those facts only proves that liberalism is a mental disorder.</comment>

<comment>Or that fools like you would like to shape our entire foreign policy around four marines being killed, but two botched wars, a drowned American city and 9/11 leave you feeling warm and fuzzy about the GOP.</comment>

<comment>So I take it that you could care less about 4 dead Americans. And one was an Ambassador, you idiot. They were not 4 Marines.You are the typical liberal progressive. Stupid, misinformed, gullible, and you believe what you are told to believe by your handlers at Salon, Media Matters, or the DNC.I suppose you are "ready for Hillary." But of course when it comes to dead Americans, you think "what difference does it make."What a loser, you pathetic lowlife.</comment>

<comment>You're a troll or an idiot. Take your pick and f*ck off.</comment>

<comment>As I accurately stated. You could care less if 4 Americans are dead, as long as you believe the lie.Two problems with liberal filth like you:  1)  you breed. 2) you vote.You are the reason I support abortion, something your mother should have done long ago. Go "blank" yourself, you disgusting lowlife piece of liberal filth.</comment>

<comment>You're just putting money over life. It's despicable. You're despicable. Shame on you.</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry. That was Detroit who cut off Flint.</comment>

<comment>Just not true. Counter-propaganda by Republicans who - no surprise - never want to take responsibility for the failures of their leaders or of their policies.</comment>

<comment>Dude. It was the great government of Flint that messed up everything. Then the great government of Detroit sold them up the river. The state government just inherited the mess.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it was Snyder and his dictator who made those decisions. The timeline has been made clear. Snyder also provided clean water to both state workers AND THE GM PLANT a full year before he "knew" about the water, to the tune of $100 million.Gotta love it how poor people get to be poisoned, and huge corporations get a ton of state money poured down their throats.Y'all are just dying and dying and dying on this hill. It's not cute.</comment>

<comment>What do you mean? The government of Flint has been running things since it began. The state only came in when it was so obvious that the locals couldn't hack it. I like how you blame the governor for not fixing the problems immediately.</comment>

<comment>Detroit and Flint have been mismanaged for 50 years. They are not innocent victims here.</comment>

<comment>Indeed, ever since I saw that Michael Moore film, even as a teenager I knew that it's a bad idea to live in Flint.  What, did they think Big Auto was going to return?</comment>

<comment>And let's not ignore that Detroit and Flint have been managed by liberal progressive Democrats for all that time.But of course, the liberal filth like Michael Moore will blame Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Except that the local council approved the decision, and even pushed for it, and the KWA specifically said they wouldn't gogo ahead with the local authorities approval.</comment>

<comment>don't let facts get in the way of the progressive narrative.</comment>

<comment>The victims elected their local government.  So, yeah, they are to blame.</comment>

<comment>Isn't it amazing? The people elect year after year, extremist liberal progressive politicians, get royally screwed each time, yet believe the rhetoric that it is all the fault of those evil Republicans, the Koch Brothers, or whatever demon the Democrats blame for the people's troubles.Proof that liberalism is a mental disorder.</comment>

<comment>but they are.https://reason.com/blog/2016/0...</comment>

<comment>It is the local residents responsibility, indeed they alone have the ability, to elect officials not by their political party, not by their skin color, not by their neighborhood, but by their qualifications to handle crap like this.  So yes, blame the victims.  Decades of their apathy and their intractability have caused this problem.</comment>

<comment>You don't know what you are talking about.  There was no democracy at work. The Republican governor appointed a manager who had sole authority over the town and took away power from the electorate.  And conservatives around the country loved it when he did that.</comment>

<comment>So unbelievably wrong and not supported by actual facts or history.  When naked ideology trumps reality, you, yes you, have a big problem.</comment>

<comment>Feel free to cite where I am wrong.  It was the appointed emergency manager  Darnell Earley who chose to switch water source to the Flint River.  The liberal city of Detroit didn't force Flint off their city water.  The Flint elected leadership didn't make the choice because they wanted a jobs program.  You can see the actual document here: https://assets.documentcloud.o...</comment>

<comment>The EM, signed off by the Council, decided to transition from Detroit's water to a regional local water board that was in development.  Before the regional authority could complete the infrastructure, Detroit did indeed force Flint off their city water by not renewing the contracts to fill in the one or two years it would take to complete the pipelines.  So yes, the Liberal, Democrat, Cleptocrat City of Detroit did indeed force Flint off their city water.</comment>

<comment>The Emergency Manager does not need Council approval for anything.  They have no power and made no real decisions.  If they did they would have kicked out the emergency manager a long time ago.   No, read the document I linked.  The EM made a decision to end the contract with Detroit for water.  He had a choice.  It was not a forced decision by Detroit.  You can stop repeating that lie now.</comment>

<comment>If that's the hill you want to die on, I hope you live here in Michigan so you have to pay for this debacle right along with us.  Our votes, however, will cancel each other out going forward, since I vote on facts and you vote on blind ideology.</comment>

<comment>Fortunately I don't live in Michigan so I won't have to bail out this governor's malfeasance.  Unfortunately it is looking likely that it will take Federal intervention to fix Michigan's problems so I probably will end up having to pay for your governor's stupidity eventually.</comment>

<comment>Since you don't live in Michigan, you have a limited and uninformed understanding of Michigan politics.  So thanks very much for playing, but you are unqualified to make the assertions you have.  Read more Shika Dalmia and less David Graham.</comment>

<comment>What a joke.  Why would I read Reason when, as you say yourself, Michigan investigators and journalists are the experts?  (For that matter why would I read Reason at all?)  I've been reading the DFP and everything I have stated has been a fact, something I notice you haven't actually disputed.</comment>

<comment>You read the Freep, as it is known here in MICHIGAN because the liberal-leaning newspaper supports your own preconceived prejudices.  Shika Dalmia writes also for other publications, but actually lives here in MICHIGAN, and is just as qualified to talk about Michigan politics and issues as anyone at the Freep.  I have disputed your "facts" in every comment.  But you're not listening to anyone else but your own prejudices.</comment>

<comment>I think people reading this exchange can see that you didn't dispute the fact that:The governor appointed an emergency manager (even after the people of Michigan voted to repeal the law entirely bit.ly/1no35JR )That emergency manager had authority over decisions made in regard to the city's water.  The local leadership, whether they agreed with anything the EM did or not, had no say or choice in decisions the EM made.  bit.ly/1JFaaAkOn March 7, 2014, the EM made a DECISION not to renew the contract with Detroit for water citing the decision to move to the Flint River as their new source. bit.ly/1VrMrEo</comment>

<comment>Anybody with two brain cells rubbing together can see you haven't argued any facts at all whereas Kathy has repeatedly pointed them out.  Enjoy your ignorance</comment>

<comment>amen</comment>

<comment>But you haven't disputed the facts WITH FACTS. Do you see how simply "disputing" doesn't equal a good argument?</comment>

<comment>I disputed it .........you're blind to the facts ..............something you can't see ............</comment>

<comment>Actually Reason isn't something liberals should read.  Liberals lack reason and common sense so the articles in that would go right over your head</comment>

<comment>You read reason because they have excellent investigative journalism </comment>

<comment>I spent a good four years neck-deep in /r/Libertarian and have heard everything they have to say (most of it repeating the same argument for entirely different scenarios). It's the cult of logical fallacy. This article is a false attribution fallacy, because the author appeals to an unidentified source to draw the conclusion. Your argument assumes that because someone doesn't live where you do, that they must be uninformed of the situation.</comment>

<comment>Shika Dalmia's reporting is vague and suggestive. She offers notions, not facts. Just like most "Reason" articles, her work gives lie to the magazine's name.</comment>

<comment>You vote your wallet to the expense of your neighbor's health and wellbeing. Don't you have even the tiniest bit of shame for that? Not even an iota? Are you such a narcissist that you truly don't care that there are 9,000 children in your state right now with severe lead poisoning, brain damage, and probably a future of psychiatric disease and crime?Republican greed basically long-term disabled 100,000 people. Is that financially sound in the long run? Or when they develop serious life-destroying diseases from the heavy metals in their bones and brain, will you throw them out on the street and complete your immorality play?</comment>

<comment>Detroit cut off the water to Flint .....educate yourself in this matter ...............it is not as simple as The Governor Did It ......really .......stop trying to appear smart ...........it doesn't work with blinders on .........</comment>

<comment>If you can't read the legal documents do I link to my post don't bother responding. Detroit did not force Flint off their water. Flint emergency manager made a choice to end the contract and not renew it with Detroit.</comment>

<comment>Read the article.  The council signed off on the plan</comment>

<comment>The initial decision isn't the problem. It's the decision a month in by Snyder and his dictator to switch GM's water to protect cars while hiding the issue from the citizens of Flint. It's disgusting, immoral, and the people of Flint should storm the statehouse. That way they can get water, snacks, media attention, and tender thoughtful treatment from Federal law enforcement.</comment>

<comment>read Time Magazine ..............February 2016 issue ...........you are misinformed .............</comment>

<comment>Your narcissism and greed are only surpassed by your pridefulness and sense of righteousness. I am really happy that regular Americans can finally see the moral bankruptcy that accompanies most Republican policies.</comment>

<comment>Stop trying - conservatives are so obsessed with money they'd watch their grandmother die in agony if she didn't manage to save enough money to pay for the painkillers.</comment>

<comment>Well I have to say that I stand corrected.  The governor's office didn't make the switch form Detroit's water to save money.  Sticking with Detroits water woudl have saved millions but the governors office did it any way for some weird reason. Hmmm...http://motorcitymuckraker.com/...</comment>

<comment>The EM made the decision to use river water, not the powerless council or Mayor. The council had commissioned a study for using river water in 2011. That study laid out all the issues and what was required to use the river water safely.Blaming the EPA is silly. They did not make any decision that effected the water. The State , through the EM, made the decision to use the river water without adequately preparing it first. The State is responsible for testing the water and sat on the results. The State passed the buck while the residents were being poisoned.Detroit was charging what the market would pay. That was still less than many cities are paying private water suppliers in America.</comment>

<comment>The EPA didn't tell people. That's wrong. Informing the public is an easy thing to do. Actually making a decision about getting the water is hard-- especially if Detroit is raising the price.</comment>

<comment>That was the realm of the MDEQ, not the EPA. The EPA does not regulate people, it regulates companies and governments.Some people are so intent on not blaming the State for screwing up that they will go to lengths that deny reality. The EM didn't even try to arrange a short term contract with Detroit. He didn't read the 2011 study. He didn't follow the EPA regulations. He didn't follow the MDEQ standards. He did nothing when reports came in of dirty water coming out of resident's taps. He ignored lab results of high lead and copper concentrations</comment>

<comment>The EPA could have had a press release. Technically not their job...but they could have done it."Not my job" has been responsible for a lot of shitty outcomes in this world.</comment>

<comment>EPA really goes out of its way to work through proper channels... which in this particular case happen to be the ones where the problem have started to begin with.</comment>

<comment>You confuse those that "could" have done something with those that "should" have done something.</comment>

<comment>wrong.  The local progressives insisted on switching as they wanted a jobs program.https://reason.com/blog/2016/0...</comment>

<comment>YOu keep posting this article and it literally says nothing substantive.</comment>

<comment>Typical conservative valuing money over human life. Quelle surprise.</comment>

<comment>The ETA messed up by sitting on their data and not alerting the local leadership, or the public so the public could pressure the leadership (remember the local leadership was not elected). Sure the ETA can't ultimately make the descision, but their job is to inform those who can.</comment>

<comment>That "local leadership" knew and did nothing. Even after the information became known, the "local leadership" did nothing but pass the buck.The EPA data was leaked and published by the Michigan ACLU.I still don't understand why so many nimrods want to defend those who's job it was to do something and blame those on the sidelines.</comment>

<comment>Its definately local leadership's fault too. Im just responding to op saying epa shares no culpability.</comment>

<comment>That "local leadership" comprised one person; the Emergency Manager.</comment>

<comment>That isn't relevant to my point at all</comment>

<comment>Right. Simply because you refuse to acknowledge that the Emergency Manager is the one that ordered the switch to river water and didn't follow the EPA or MDEQ regulations and standards. When you talk about "local leadership", the EM was the local leadership.</comment>

<comment>What? When did i refuse to acknowledge that? Are you confusing me with someone else? I'll repeat, all I'm saying is the eta shares some culpability.</comment>

<comment>"not locally elected leadership"This may be giving the 'emergency manager' too much credit.</comment>

<comment>Under the Safe Drinking Water Act the EPA IS responsible for setting acceptable containment levels and monitoring compliance.  They didn't do such a good job ensuring compliance, did they?</comment>

<comment>No they didn't do a good job of monitoring the incompetent policies of the governor.</comment>

<comment>Remember when arguing with libertarians pointing out any failure of government is basically conceding their point to them.  Only partisan hacks lose by having their party be to blame.</comment>

<comment>So instead of government following the regulations and standards set for them, they ignored them. Ya, that sounds like we don't need no stinking regulations. That also sounds like why 100,000 people were exposed to high to extremely high levels of lead..</comment>

<comment>What good are regulations that are ignored and not enforced?</comment>

<comment>Which is one reason why we build jails.</comment>

<comment>It's been a year, who has gone to jail over this?</comment>

<comment>There are Federal, State, and local investigations going on plus several lawsuits.By the time this is finished, expect several people to be in jail.</comment>

<comment>So once again the government is playing crime janitor instead of actually proactively using all the regulations it passed that add massive compliance costs in a way that actually protects people.</comment>

<comment>What did you want the government to do?</comment>

<comment>The same thing I want it to do with immigration and Ebola.  Enforce the law and protect the people.  When a municipal water system that supplies water to 100k people fails a containment test I expect the EPA to notify the impacted population and send agency representatives to work with the municipal water system to resolve the problem.  If the people at the municipal water system aren't capable or willing to do so to I expect them to be removed and replaced them with people that can.The Army has mobile units that supply water to our troops in the middle of wars.  Now I know Flint is super dangerous, but surely as a last resort we could deploy some of these guys to have supplied safe water.  Or brokered a deal to get Detroit water back.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter what water they use. The pipes have been damaged by using untreated river water. AND, they have been back on Detroit water for a couple of months.The purpose of the EPA is not to manage the Flint water system. That was the job of the Emergency Manager and the State of Michigan. When notified, the Governor's office, the ONLY office that could react, refused to do anything but blame the residents.The people were being told by their doctors and others in the community. The University of Virginia released the results. The Michigan ACLU released the results. The results of lead were out there. It was only after the release of the Governor's office emails that this became a known, preventable tragedy.Yes, it would have been better if the EPA did release their report. But, it had already been released by the M-ACLU.</comment>

<comment>The Army and Navy have portable water treatment systems and the Army has delivery trucks.  They are perfectly capable of providing water distribution for the whole city that entirely bypasses the existing piping.  Why is it our Commander in Chief can bomb a Country on the other side of the World and deliver water to Haiti after an earthquake but can't seem to be bothered to deliver water to support a city that overwhelmingly voted for him?You make excuses trying to place partisan blame.  I explain all the failed opportunities government at all levels had to assist and how they all let the people down.</comment>

<comment>Every time someone wants a shower or to fill a coffee pot, there isn't a military truck outside waiting.Currently the problem isn't the supply; Detroit has very good water. The problem is the delivery. The pipes have been damaged. It is winter in central Michigan. They can't just run hoses to every house.Setting up a temporary water supply using hoses or even trucks at each corner might work in warmer temperatures and for short periods might work in an emergency. They don't work nearly as well when it is you that wants to turn on your kitchen tap to fill your coffee pot. The city will need to repair the pipes, replace the pipes, or condemn entire neighborhoods and move the residents. That includes entire commercial and industrial sections. None of those things are cheap nor easy.You blame those on the edges and ignored those that are responsible. Then you come up with ideas that just aren't feasible and deride others for not using them. Obviously you still don't understand the problem.</comment>

<comment>No, it's you who apparently doesn't understand how clean drinking water gets distributed in these cases.  They don't re-plumb your house to temporary water sources. They do it like they do in disasters and they set up water distribution points and you come pick up bottled water or fill 5 gallon containers.Then you take that water home and use it for cooking.  And before you bother replying with all the reasons that isn't workable consider in Africa women walk miles to rivers to do this every single day.  This is also what they did in Haiti after the Earthquake and all over the US after various Hurricanes.Here, let me show you with pictures that illustrate the concept.  Notice the men in camouflage carrying water to vehicles for people?  That's the National Guard.  When you live in a State where the Governor isn't as idle as the President these guys can come help.  If you'd like I can get you some pictures of water being delivered to people's houses to illustrate the concept of how clean water gets to people without using their house pipes.http://www.japantimes.co.jp/ne...</comment>

<comment>Then you take that water home and use it for cooking.  And before you bother replying with all the reasons that isn't workable consider in Africa women walk miles to rivers to do this every single day.And I suppose these Africans do this in the middle of winter with snow and a high temp of 20 deg. What you ignore is this is NOT Africa or Haiti. Cold water baths in 20 deg temps doesn't work for many people.It also ignores that the resident's pipes have been damaged and now require either replacement or repair. The system water is clean. The delivery isn't. Unless you plan on using this NG delivery system for the next few years you haven't thought it through. Temporary work-arounds won't fix the problem..</comment>

<comment>We'll add geography of Africa and absorption of lead into the body to the list of topics you have a flawed understanding of.Go Google Leslotho.  It has snow and freezing temperatures and the people still need to haul water.As to lead and bathing:"Lead (except for certain organic lead compounds not covered by the standard, such as tetraethyl lead) is not absorbed through your skin."https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaw...So there you go.  Don't drink the bath water and you'll be fine (I'd still do it quickly and not with really hot water).What part of water tankers and bottled water distribution suggests I was ignoring bad pipes?  More amusingly bad pipes ought to lead you to exactly the thing I was suggesting from the beginning; handing out water.  An alternative while you replace the pipes would be using a $250 distiller in every home (when you distill water you leave many contaminants like lead behind).</comment>

<comment>This wasn't an argument that government failed, it was an argument that the "small government is good government" philosophy failed. This happened once the city came under Republican control because the big spending liberal city was supposedly irresponsible. Turns out that Republican management was far far worse. </comment>

<comment>The EPA is not an example of small government.  It is an example of the sort of over-reaching unaccountable Federal agency libertarians dislike, and true to form their over-sight was of zero benefit protecting Flint, just like the SEC was of zero benefit protecting investors from Bernie Madoff.</comment>

<comment>Repeat with me:  the EPA did not create this disaster. </comment>

<comment>Repeat after me: The EPA is responsible for enforcement of the Safe Drinking Water Act and monitoring compliance with it.  Flint was non-compliant for how long?  What did the EPA do?</comment>

<comment>As I said previously, yes the EPA should have caught and stopped the screwed up criminal acts of the governor far sooner.  But the EPA didn't create the problem that poisoned kids.</comment>

<comment>The EPA knew long before the governor did.  The municipal people should have known before the EPA did.  So we have a failure at all three levels of government, but let's just blame the governor because it's a Republican.</comment>

<comment>The governor's office made the decisions in this case.  Like I said, yes the EPA should have done a better job of oversight in this case.  Of course, in general I think that the EPA needs to be stronger in it's enforcement, so I think we are in agreement there.</comment>

<comment>The EPA did its job as per the CWSA. If they overstepped and actualy halted the state's decision then libertarians would be crying about tyrannical government. Welcome to libertarian "logic" where a failure in austerity by a state government poisoned people, but it's the EPA's fault because "big government".</comment>

<comment>"EPA works with its federal, state and tribal regulatory partners through a comprehensive Safe Drinking Water Act compliance monitoring program to protect human health and the environment by ensuring that the regulated community obeys environmental laws/regulations through on-site visits by qualified inspectors, and a review of the information EPA or a state/tribe requires to be submitted."http://www.epa.gov/enforcement...So please, tell me what the EPA did when it discovered Flint's water violated lead containment levels.</comment>

<comment>Civil Administration Action. They had to send a letter of notice to the offending office (in which they did and the state ignored it). Apparently, they've moved on to the Civil Judicial Action stage and suing the state. The enforcement options are listed on the Basics of Enforcement page.Edit: by the way, the real issue is why they didn't tell the public, not that they didn't do their job. That's because they don't have the legal authority to release that information to the public until they conduct their own study (not just have some test results). Same thing applied when they were conducting their fracking study. If they went off telling everyone fracking causes poisoned flammable drinking water, and didn't have the evidence to prove it, and it turned out false, the fracking industry would sue our nation into oblivion.</comment>

<comment>The EPA confirmed these problems in April 2014 after identifying potential problems in February 2014.  Rather than going public with information the EPA's Susan Hedman sought legal advice and didn't hear back until NOVEMBER 2014.  Every single level of government failed here.</comment>

<comment>The EPA did exactly what it was legally required to do. You can twist it however you want to fill some libertarian fantasy, but this was solely a state level screw up due to austerity.If you want the EPA to have enough authority to shrug off liability if it makes a mistake then Republicans and libertarians need to stop whining about there being too much government.</comment>

<comment>What liability?  The EPA CONFIRMED the failed test results in April, then sat on it for 7 months waiting for it's lawyers to tell it what to do while 100k people drank leaded water.  The law requires these citizens to be notified.And you want to blame the governor for austerity.  Except the problem is this situation has happened over and over and one instance was in Washington D.C. where you don't have any Republicans you can blame and the EPA similarly failed.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Having a confirmed test saying the water is unsafe isn't enough for the EPA to make the decision, all that means is they tested a few pipes for lead and it was positive (they don't know why or how widespread it is until they conduct a full study). At that point, it is the responsibility of the state when the EPA notified them of the failed pipes.If you read the wiki page you linked, you'd see the biggest problem there. Water utility companies were cheating on their EPA tests to provide passing results (such as flushing pipes they knew would fail prior to the EPA testing them).The issue and criticism is that the EPA is toothless when it comes to testing and enforcement (it isn't powerful enough). We had the exact same problem with cheating on tests from food production facilities. As a result, the USDA is now required to be on-site at production facilities. Now every time we turn around we find out there's E. Coli in our peanut butter and salmonella on our spinach, and we can identify the farms they came from within days and have the product pulled from shelves. That isn't feasible with the EPA though, due to the scope of their responsibility, unless you want to vastly increase their budget.Either way, we know the problem here wasn't EPA testing or a local government's decision to use river water. It was a governor's bad decision to apply austerity to public infrastructure and he wasn't going to let the big, bad federal government impede his states' right to poison its population to save a few bucks that probably went towards building a luxury greenway for some rich suburb.</comment>

<comment>Yup.  All these arguments that it is the EPA's fault is an argument to give the EPA more power and authority.</comment>

<comment>Except now it's clear that the move didn't save money.  In fact, the EM moved forward with the move to use the Flint water even when it became clear that staying with Detroit water would SAVE money.    http://motorcitymuckraker.com/...So not only did the move poison kids, it wasted taxpayer money.</comment>

<comment>....and let people get poisoned.  The EPA is a total waste of taxpayer money.  The bad water might be someone else's fault, letting people drink it is clearly an EPA blunder.</comment>

<comment>Not meeting the standards was the City of Flint's fault. The EPA didn't tamper with anything or force Flint to do anything. The City failed to meet the standards of the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality as well as the EPA.The State is responsible as they and only they did the change to river water. The city did not have the option. It was the State through the Emergency Manager that poisoned the residents.</comment>

<comment>The city of Detroit jacked up the rates.The EPA sat on a report for months. The city was a failure after decades of Democrat rule. </comment>

<comment>The City of Flint was screwed over by the State. The decision to use river water was made by the EM. The cover up was done by the State.http://www.freep.com/story/opi...</comment>

<comment>Nice of you to ignore the EPA and the city of Detroit.Objective people see a failure of government at all levels - partisans blame one party. And you are a dishonest and partisan hack - so no surprise thereTell me - why was Flint under an EM in the first place?  </comment>

<comment>The EPA did not force the EM or State to choose river water. The EPA did not tell the EM or State not to respond to the toxic levels of lead. The EPA did not float emails among the Governor's aids on ignoring the problem.The City of Detroit did not cut off the water supply. The County still used Detroit water after Flint went to river water.Why Flint was under an EM was a decision the Governor took. He also takes responsibility for what the EM does. When he removed the democratic council, he also removed the immunity of the State for damages.</comment>

<comment>The city of Detroit forced Flint's hand, as the city needed two years to make the switch.One broke Dem city exploiting another. </comment>

<comment>The City of Detroit was in bankruptcy proceedings. Genessee County had shared the pipe with Flint but did not drop the Detroit water when Flint did. There was no ultimatum that Flint, or the County, had to quit Detroit water.</comment>

<comment>You mean the EM who was a Democrat? Appointed because the Republican governor didn't want to upset the delicate political sensibilities of a one-party town like Flint, so he gave them a member of their own party? You mean him?Maybe if Democrats weren't petulant children who demand total ideological conformity from everyone they come in contact with, the governor could have appointed a more competent EM. But Flint wouldn't work with a non-Democrat, despite the fact that Democrats have ruined every city they've ever run.But yeah, keep blaming the Governor. Flint and Detroit were basically utopias before he took office, right?</comment>

<comment>Why does it matter what party the EM belonged to? He still arrogantly ignored the water regulations of the EPA, the standards of the MDEQ, and the recommendations of the 2011 engineering report.It wouldn't matter if the council and Mayor didn't get along with the EM. They had absolutely no input or authority in the decision.</comment>

<comment>It matters because people are trying to blame Republicans for this screwup.  If there wasn't a single Republican directly involved then that case is hard to make.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately for your point, all of this was done by those that were either Republicans or appointed by the Republican Governor.Blaming the Democrats is stupid. They had absolutely no say in the matter.</comment>

<comment>"all of this was done by those that were either Republicans or appointed by the Republican Governor."Except the "appointed by the Republican Governor" was a Democrat.  Since there's no evidence I can see that the Governor did squat it's all Democrats, including the guys who wanted the deal in the first place, the local government.</comment>

<comment>1) The local government never wanted river water. But I'll let you try and find a source that says they did. In 2012, the City Council voted to use the KWA and their own pipeline from Lake Huron.2) The Democrats had nothing to do with this. The decision was made by Ed Kurtz, a Republican appointed by Snyder. Kurtz also hired an engineering firm to make the switch to river water in June of 2013. Earley, a Democrat in name, was sitting in the EM's office when the switch was made a few months later. He was the one who, along with the Republican controlled State, lied to everyone in Flint. http://www.mlive.com/news/flin...3) Snyder has fired the head of the MDEQ. He hasn't fired anyone in his own office that was aware and did nothing about the crisis.</comment>

<comment>"In 2012, the City Council voted to use the KWA and their own pipeline from Lake Huron.'So what did they want to use?  What was the alternative they imagined?  And imagined is the word."2) The Democrats had nothing to do with this. The decision was made by Ed Kurtz, a Republican appointed by Snyder. "What decision?  The decision to use the river water was made by a DEMOCRAT EM and it was only necessary because as already pointed out, the council voted for it.</comment>

<comment>So you can't find any source that suggested the City authorized or even knew the EM was going to use river water.BTW, the County shared the pipe with Detroit and continued to use Detroit water all that time.Grow up.</comment>

<comment>So again. WHAT WERE THEY PLANNING TO USE?</comment>

<comment>Detroit water. Just like the County did.</comment>

<comment>Except that of course they had just rejected the use of Detroit water.</comment>

<comment>I'm seriously concerned here. You seem to be having a very difficult time with reality. It was the Emergency Manager that decided to stop using Detroit water and to use river water.  No elected person had any choice, say, or input into the decision. Ed Kurtz was, and still is, a registered Republican.</comment>

<comment>*The Republican governor replaced the elected government.</comment>

<comment>What precisely is the point of the EPA being responsible for implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act and mandating results be reported to it if it isn't going to bother enforcing violations of the contaminant levels?</comment>

<comment>and you're still wrong and misinformed .............</comment>

<comment>Their probably too busy with their swat training.</comment>

<comment>The EPA doesn't have anything to do with the idiot and criminal decision that the Governor made.</comment>

<comment>The EPA made their own decision to sit on the data. That could have changed everything. But they just kept quiet. Why?</comment>

<comment>According to this, the decision to switch water sources was NOT a cost-cutting measure, but a Keynsian stimulus program gone wrong.The Flint Water Crisis Is the Result of a Stimulus Project Gone WrongThe new water system was never a cost-cutting measure. It was an expensive jobs project.https://reason.com/blog/2016/0...</comment>

<comment>Do you have a legitimate source for this? I'm not saying it isn't a public works stimulus project, the people of Flint could use it, but Reason is a well-known Libertarian propaganda site.</comment>

<comment>Just like the The Atlantic is a well-known progressive propaganda site. Actually, Reason articles (as befits the name) tend to be better sourced and much better written than most of juicebox offerings on this site.You can't learn if you never read what the other side is writing.</comment>

<comment>That's why we're debating in an Atlantic article praising corporate generosity and lambasting government? Yes, I'm aware Atlantic has a bias towards Democrats (especially Hillary).Even in the article you linked, there is nothing saying it was a public works project besides the author's assumption based on alleged hearsay (ie bullshit). That's what I mean by a legit source.I don't need to read Libertarian articles to know what they're writing. They use the exact same non-evolving, ineffectual rhetoric for every argument. Why would I want to use a broken clock when I know of several that work (might not have the correct time, but they work).</comment>

<comment>But I can get my digestive system cleared up without an enema.Sorry, Reason doesn't cut it in any way.  That's my assessment having spent enough time in one area of expertise.</comment>

<comment>It's worse than how it's sourced.  EVERY number you see (in that area) has an agenda and has been presented to MISinform.In statistics, in the likelihood models, there is the concept that you can have a model be worse than the know-nothing model.That is Reason Foundation.</comment>

<comment>Name one time they lied or distorted you filthy animal.  You don't care how many people die as long as you get to blame the innocent and excuse the guilty.</comment>

<comment>I think you got the wrong number - you were trying to talk to a filthy animal about some subject I don't know.  Please re-direct.  If you are referring to the Reason Foundation, then I just did, it's EVERY TIME it publishes anything.</comment>

<comment>So you can't name a single time they did you lying little animal.  You don't care if people die as long as the right people get blamed.  You disgust every rational person who knows you.</comment>

<comment>Apparently you WERE talking to me, and you won't take the info that EVERYTHING they post is bunk.OK, first example, their infrastructure condition reports.  Their sorry analyst thinks road and bridge conditions have been getting better, and that's looking at the same data I have been looking at.Sorry, you'll have to get off your lazy butt and study up.Or just accept the opinion of someone who has indeed read that junk.No more debate accepted, especially after insults and no desire to critique the data at all.Bye bye and good riddance.</comment>

<comment>Only Nadine would post something so stupid.Flint was paying Detroit $1.3 million per month for water. The EM decided that it would be cheaper to use river water. The problem was that he ignored all the standards and regulations. There were no new hires to treat the river water.The river water wasn't free. It was most likely even more expensive as it was costly to remove the taste. It also required much more cleaning and disinfecting, which weren't done.</comment>

<comment>Yes, that old SAT question,Reason:Foundation Lid:trash canthere is one area where I am able to quickly peruse through the analysis and data (before the smell makes me queasy) and see clearly proof of the adage, "if you make up the data you can prove anything."  Therefore, no more reason to look.</comment>

<comment>No.</comment>

<comment>The city of Detroit made the decision to jack up the rates, which precipitated the crisis in the first place.  The Democratic City Council approved the switch.  And the EPA sat on a report for months.Don't be a stupid, partisan hack.It was a total failure of government at all levels.</comment>

<comment>The idea of running a pipe to Flint directly from Lake Huron had been tossed around sine the 1960s. It wasn't OKed only because of Detroit's price.The decision to use the river water was never approved by the Council. They approved the Engineer's report in 2011 which did not recommend river water. The EM decided on his own to use river water. He did not need nor sought the City Council's approval.While the EPA was wrong to sit on the report, they did not hold back any information that was not already public. A copy of their report was leaked to the media through the Michigan ACLU.You though deny who is to blame on this. The State and the Governor's office.</comment>

<comment>lol...Because this single person said not to test the water ? What would happen if a private company did this to people ?</comment>

<comment>He wanted to "create jobs" with the pipeline build.  Dems were on board with that one, too. republicans don't have a monopoly on foolishness.   Michigans government is a joke.Let's recall why they needed to look for stimulus projects and cash: politicians ran the city into the ground through stimulus projects and handouts in a blue state where the greatest export was people who saw the crisis coming.But the real problem here is Coke. How dare they provide so much water.  When some kid in Flint</comment>

<comment>no it did not. The facts are the governors office did not recommend the swtich. Local politicians (aka: Progressives) wanted to switch as they wanted a jobs program.https://reason.com/blog/2016/0...</comment>

<comment>Correct.  Moving away from the Detroit Water monopoly has been a *cough* pipe dream since the 1960s.    http://www.mlive.com/news/flin...The project was support by the previous Flint Mayor Brown and Mayor Walling was on the KWA board.  This is all before Flint was appointed an EM in 2011.  http://www.mlive.com/news/flin...</comment>

<comment>Someone already linked that and I already pointed out the bullshit. The author made a false attribution fallacy and based the entire article around it (ie, they made up the entire thing and said a little birdie told them).</comment>

<comment>You could not be more hopelessly wrong: https://goo.gl/EIGjxp</comment>

<comment>Why do people keep posting a BS opinion piece as if it were factual?</comment>

<comment>It's why I stopped debating Libertarians years ago in hopes they'd die off when Ron Paul was laughed off the political stage and everyone realized Peter Schiff is a crackpot that got lucky. Alas, here they are with their tin foil hats on while thumping Atlas Shrugged and spreading their nonsense like a bad outbreak of herpes.</comment>

<comment>Because it's not BS and you know it.  Nor is it an "opinion piece".</comment>

<comment>So you didn't even read the article. That explains it.On the off chance you did read it, then that would be indicative of your intellectual astuteness.</comment>

<comment>I did you lied.</comment>

<comment>What a hack.</comment>

<comment>No.  It didn't.  It was a 100% local government decision.  Nerf.</comment>

<comment>Time Magazine article does not bear that out .......the information you are spreading is patently FALSE .............</comment>

<comment>It was stated that the emergency manager in charge of Flint was appointed by the governor. He's also the same guy responsible for Detroit's toxic schools. The federal government also isn't responsible for the typical poor right-wing planning, even if it should step up here. So, yes, much of the responsibility falls on the governor.</comment>

<comment>The article explained how the local and federal government also had responsibility, but a rabid partisan like you can be expected to ignore that.</comment>

<comment>Did you even read the article, or click the NPR link on the EPA? The city had zero authority, even if they had said no after the decision was made. The EPA has zero authority and can only advise the state (which the state in-turn mismanaged). This was entirely a problem with the governor's poor decision making and poorer choice in emergency manager (that he employed more than once, despite his record).Just because modern right-wing policy tends to run states and nations into the ground (like what happened to my home state of NC) doesn't make me partisan. Modern Republicans are Reactionaries, not true conservatives. Saying I'm partisan because I call Reactionaries idiots is like saying I'm a Communist because I don't agree with the Nazi party.</comment>

<comment>I think YOU failed to read the article. "...Local officials did, however, weigh in on the decision to switch away from Detroit water to the Flint River, and the city council voted in favor, 7-1...".And also, the EPA certainly DOES have the authority to ensure that  Federal water standards are being followed - if they are not, lawsuits and fines are supposed to follow.</comment>

<comment>Local officials appointed by the governor.</comment>

<comment>Yes, once local authorities prove themselves incompetent.</comment>

<comment>They were replaced by incompetents unless you're defending the move to the Detroit river.  That was criminally negligent.  </comment>

<comment>They replaced mere incompetence with criminal negligence.  </comment>

<comment>As clif said, the local officials were the emergency team appointed by the governor. The council vote was irrelevant since they had no authority in the situation.The EPA already said it can't force states to do anything, and if you read the CWSA you'd know that. All they can do is sue them, which requires a lot of evidence and takes a very long time (look how long they studied fracking to show it causes flammable drinking water). All they have is a study that might suffice, but it might not, depending on how much of a dick Snyder wants to be about this (I'm guessing a lot, because I've yet to see a Republican politician that gives a crap about poor working class Americans).</comment>

<comment>The vote is not irrelevant.   Flint has wanted a move away from Detroit Water since the 1960s.    The Democrat Treasurer (he was the last signature to sign the KWA check) is at fault for letting the Democrat council have it's way without using his powers to stop them.   That within itself is not a problem.  But characterizing this as a Republican or Governor initiated project is incorrect.</comment>

<comment>The 7-1 vote was to approve the pipeline to Huron. The lone vote was for the Flint River. The choice to go on river water was made by the Emergency Manager. Nobody in the city had the authority to override him. Also, I don't think Treasurers work the way you think they do. We don't allow them unlimited power like that.</comment>

<comment>"Also, I don't think Treasurers work the way you think they do.""Dillon made his decision to allow Flint to enter into a contract with KWA"http://www.mlive.com/news/flin..."Emergency manager decisions are approved by the State Treasurer—the same office that appoints EMs."http://michiganradio.org/post/...</comment>

<comment>A governor may override the treasurer's approval, but I see what you're saying. Yes, they can approve budget items like building a new pipeline, they just don't have unlimited executive power. However, you do realize that Dillon only approved the KWA pipeline, right? Not the use of river water.In fact, even the Emergency Manager initially rejected the river. The move to use it was made directly by the governor's office. Dillon wasn't even treasurer when that decision was made.Regardless, the vote in question was against using the river, not for it. Only one person on the council supported using the river. This was purely a failed attempt at austerity by Snyder.</comment>

<comment>"However, you do realize that Dillon only approved the KWA pipeline, right? Not the use of river water."Yes, I don't dispute that comment.You are slightly confusing two subjects though.  One was primary water source project (KWA, Detroit vs. Flint River).The second is Detroit cancelling their current contract with Flint (Detroit Water's largest customer).  This went into effect 1 year from the notification.  Genessee renegotiated with Flint to continue services under a new contract until KWA came online.   Flint decided to use the Flint River as a supply.  No vote by City Council, but they actively cheered in our local press and the Mayor 'pressed the button'.   Had they disagreed with the EM, there is absolutely no political benefit to stay silent.   I think this context and nuance is important.    Ultimately, Snyder has already admitted that he is the Governor and the decisions of his staff were inconsistent with common sense.I'm reserving judgement on comments such as 'failed attempt at austerity by Snyder' until more documentation becomes available.    I'm also less concerned with this entire part of the story. Had the water been treated correctly - it appears none of this would have become national news.I'm only interested in furthering my own education.  I'm not interested in the narratives molded by party affiliations; ignorant entertainers or opportunists.Enjoy your weekend.</comment>

<comment>The council just shown up at the groundbreaking. It doesn't look good, but it's not necessarily an endorsement. An example, I ran a federal office and had an opposing senator (voted to cut my budget) show up at my ribbon cutting because my office still provided his constituents with jobs.My concern is the increasingly conservative direction the nation has been heading for the past 16 years and the persistence of blatantly bad ideas in the name of towing the party line (austerity, free trade, trickle-down, etc). That includes Democratss. I mean 50 years ago, Hillary would have been a blatant Republican candidate along the lines of Nixon, and that's what passes for "liberal" today. The US might as well give up and just ask Marcos to lead us with options like Trump and Hillary.</comment>

<comment>The problem wasn't turning to river water. It was in not properly treating the water. The EM ignored the EPA, MDEQ, and 2011 Engineering report. That all belongs on the head of the EM. The Mayor and Council had no authority on the matter and did not even vote on it.When the problem became known, the EM and the State health department ignored it. The aids in the Governor's office tried to bury it.</comment>

<comment>"The problem wasn't turning to river water. It was in not properly treating the water. "  I agree."The EM ignored the EPA, MDEQ, and 2011 Engineering report." The Rowe, 2011 Engineering Report?  http://www.scribd.com/doc/6438..."That all belongs on the head of the EM."   Treatment controls falls on Flint Water and MDEQ.  -I'll be interested in this being documented in more detail.  The MDEQ failings have been documented and agreed upon by everyone, including the Governor.  The failings of Flint Water Department needs more detail in reporting, but here is one article on the potential local issues; http://www.mlive.com/news/flin..."The Mayor and Council had no authority on the matter and did not even vote on it."  -I agree that they really didn't have effective authority and this demonstrates an issue with the EM authorities.  The lawsuits will probably help disclose any email between the EMs, Mayor and Council.  The Mayor and Council were in support of the switch and did not use decision as an opportunity to question the EM, but appear to be, at the minimum, complacent or agreeable to the decision;http://www.mlive.com/news/flin...I don't know Kurtz or Brown well enough to comment on their natures.  Given Earley's long history in our local politics (Saginaw & Flint) - I can see him being very 'friendly and agreeable' relationship with council and mayor.  A lot of people don't understand the feuding between Detroit Water and the animosity Flint leaders (and citizens) have towards Detroit Water rate bills; http://www.mlive.com/news/flin...At the end of it all; this will be an exercise in sovereign and officer immunity.</comment>

<comment>I like a guy that knows what he is talking about and can explain it with cites.I have a feeling that the State will lose its sovereign immunity. The State does have a duty of care to its citizens. http://biotech.law.lsu.edu/map...Also,  I would think intentionally violating State and Federal law rises to gross negligence.</comment>

<comment>Thank you.  You are probably correct on that, I'm really not familiar with how that works.  I suspect the MDEQ WB and Flint Water Department staff might appreciate that information and go over it in detail with their attorneys.Are you from the area? You seem to be more informed than most.  I'm hoping to hop into the city this weekend for some Vehicle City Tacos !Enjoy your weekend.</comment>

<comment>I live in Northern Indiana. We have relatives in Canada and travel through Flint. It is often a pit stop for us. The last few times we've stopped at the Bob Evens, which I believe is County.I'm a mechanical engineer so have a rough idea of the how. As a Quality Manager, I need to understand a lot of the why.</comment>

<comment>There are at least two lawsuits against the State at this moment.BTW, the council did not vote to use river water. There was a 2011 study that was passed with a 7-1 margin. The decision to use river water was solely the EM and the council did not vote on it.</comment>

<comment>The article got that part about the council wrong. That vote was in 2011 on building their own pipeline from Lake Huron. The report they voted on did not recommend using river water. When the decision to use river water was made, the Council was neither consulted nor approved. Although the decision by the EM was autocratic, the crime was not properly treating the water. Again, a decision that rests with the EM and the Governor.The EPA does have enforcement authority. That does not excuse those who violate the law though. The EPA has set standards for water quality, but it doesn't operate the treatment plants.Why are you excusing those who screwed up and blaming the ancillary players?</comment>

<comment>The EPA may order the city to stop using the water. Unfortunately, they need water for other things, especially fire fighting.At this point, the EPA is mostly hamstrung in what orders it may give. The problem is in the pipes and they can't be fixed overnight. They may still assess fines and recommend criminal charges.</comment>

<comment>They can order them via admin action, but it's a toothless order. That's what the judicial action is for. Of course, by the time the suit is won they could probably replace the entire water system for the city. Snyder is really the only one with the authority to do anything right now (and by proxy, the EM he appointed).</comment>

<comment>The EM is no longer controlling Flint. They now have an elected council and Mayor.</comment>

<comment>I'm aware the last guy was removed. I hadn't paid attention if they replaced him.</comment>

<comment>"The city had zero authority, even if they had said no after the decision was made. "The city specifically approved the policy and the KWA specifically said they would not go ahead without that approval.</comment>

<comment>They approved the pipeline to Huron, not getting water from the Flint River.http://www.mlive.com/news/flin...The temporary water was decided by the emergency manager. He chose to use the river because it was cheaper than Detroit Water. The problem came from the fact that the state was aware the water was not suitable without proper treatment, but didn't care.</comment>

<comment>"The problem came from the fact that the state was aware the water was not suitable without proper treatment, but didn't care."      That is incorrect.   The Flint River was used as a supply in 2009, it is also the backup water source and a former desire of previous council members to be a primary source.   The problem came from the incorrect direction of MDEQ Water Bureau staff not requiring corrosive controls.   In addition, Flint Water staff knowingly collected insufficient water samples using improper sampling methods.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is correct, as the state disregarded the Admin Action the EPA took. You didn't read the article that I linked saying that the council voted 7-1 for the pipeline with the lone vote being for the river, did you?Making things up isn't going to absolve poor right-wing decision making in this.</comment>

<comment>  The Flint River was used as a supply in 2009, it is also the backup water source and a former desire of previous council members to be a primary source.Flint used river water until 1962. They then changed to Detroit water and used it exclusively until 2014. While river water remained a back up, Flint didn't have the treatment facilities to use it solely.</comment>

<comment>"In fact, Flint residents in 2009 were drinking Flint River water for about two days because of a problem with the 72-inch main water pipeline from Detroit, Brent Wright said;" http://www.mlive.com/news/flin...As you have stated, the interim switch really isn't the issue.  The issue is treating the water and responding to complaints.</comment>

<comment>Wow, that's a really uninformative article you've linked to.  It says NOTHING about who approved the plan the important decisions, such as to stop using Detroit's water.</comment>

<comment>Uninformative? It's the vote on the new water plan. They chose the pipeline, not river. The temporary water issue was solely on the governor's appointed Emergency Manager. Man, you right-wingers really aren't in touch with reality.</comment>

<comment>"They chose the pipeline, not river."And what does it say about who choose the river?  Nothing you dishonest little toad.  That's why it's uninformative, and you chose an uninformative source because you know informative sources condemn the council.</comment>

<comment>It says the person that chose the river was a moron that decided poisoning people was worth saving a few million dollars. That moron just happened to be Snyder, based on the current testimony.The council did not choose to use the river. The governor's office did. In fact, the city told the governor's office that the river was poisoning people and he chose to ignore them and the EPA's notification that the water was undrinkable. This was your typical right-wing screw up in the name of your typical failed right-wing ideology. Democrats are hardly great, but the Republicans need to die off before they regress us back to the dark age.</comment>

<comment>"It says the person that chose the river was a moron that decided poisoning people was worth saving a few million dollars."No it doesn't."The council did not choose to use the river. "What were they planning to do then?  They decided to stop buying water from Detriot, did they approve the plan of using the Flint River or did they just act without planning?  Either way they are at fault and either way the Mayor did lie about the water." This was your typical right-wing screw up in the name of your typical failed right-wing ideology."What exactly was "right-wing" about any of this?  There was no attempt to privatise, reduce government power or do anything that is sterotypically "right wing".  What there was was massive unnecessary public works programs.</comment>

<comment>That has absolutely nothing to do with using river water. In 2011 the council approved the Engineering Report that recommended the Lake Huron pipeline. It also warned that using river water came with a lower up front price but a much higher treatment cost and that a new treatment plant was required. The EM ignored that report.When the decision was made to use river water, the Council wasn't consulted and didn't vote on it. That though means nothing. The problem is the water wasn't treated. That is what caused the problems.</comment>

<comment>"That has absolutely nothing to do with using river water. "Actually it did.  The council knew that it had to have a stopgap measure because the pipeline wouldn't be ready for years.  Without their approval now of this would have happened."The problem is the water wasn't treated. That is what caused the problems."Yes and the council LIED about the quality of the water.</comment>

<comment>Nope. There was a 2011 engineering report that gave the city council their options. The council voted 7-1 to join those building their own pipe from Lake Huron. The City never voted to use river water, even as a stopgap measure.Under MDEQ regulations, the city could only use river water on a temporary basis. The last time was in 2009 for just under two days. The treatment plant wasn't equipped to treat river water. According to the 2011 report, it would cost $60 million to upgrade the treatment plant to use river water while it would require only a $10 million refurbishment of the plant for Lake Huron water or a continued Detroit water.The Mayor and City Council did not approve the 2014 change to river water. That was the decision of the Emergency Manager and his only. The elected politicians had no authority to even have a vote. These is no evidence the council were even aware that the EM planned on changing the source. What is known is that the council never had a vote on the matter. This is why there are all those law suits against the State and Governor and none against the city.I'm sure you knew all that but just wanted to lie.</comment>

<comment>Lets say, hypothetically speaking, that the govenor was a democrat. Then every repub would be banging the gong on how this is a failure of a democratic progressive society, blah, blah, blah. Either way, no govenor should be able to skate by on this one. Its a massive failure, and since he appointed the emergency manager, he does hold some level of accountability.</comment>

<comment>Keep drinking that rightwing kool aid, the Governor is solely responsible for this f**k up.</comment>

<comment>Even the Atlantic and Mother Jones have BOTH noted that local, state and federal authorities all dropped the ball.So the Atlantic and Mother Jones are "right-wing kool-aid" now?</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic author also got it wrong. They didn't even cite the 7-1 vote correctly.</comment>

<comment>So you ARE saying that the Atlantic is "right wing kool aid".</comment>

<comment>No, I'm not talking about the Atlantic as a whole. This article has a heavy Libertarian slant though (might explain the massive amount of Libertarians in these comments), and keeping in line with Libertarian articles, this one ignores many facts, incorrectly cites, and uses flawed logic in order to write a corporate puff piece and put blame on "liberal government".</comment>

<comment>"No, I'm not talking about the Atlantic as a whole. "You are however saying that the Atlantic has drunk libertarian Kool-Aid, which is unlikely."No, I'm not talking about the Atlantic as a whole. "You are however saying that the Atlantic has drunk libertarian Kool-Aid, which is unlikely.  That you ignore the fact that _Mother Jones_ also said the blame wasn't all on the Republicans means you're being dishonest, not stupid.</comment>

<comment>Where did I say that the Atlantic was anything? I said the author got his facts wrong. The strange thing is that he was aware that the 7-1 vote was for the pipeline.http://www.theatlantic.com/pol..."The city council did have a chance to weigh in on that change, and supported it 7-1."I then said this article has a Libertarian slant, including the usual ignoring half of the facts and incorrect citations. Again, nowhere did I say anything about the Atlantic itself.As for Mother Jones, I went ahead and read the article, and this paragraph is what they're basing their opinion on:On Monday, EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy insisted, "EPA did its job but clearly the outcome was not what anyone would have wanted." But a day later, the agency said that "while EPA worked within the framework of the law to repeatedly and urgently communicate the steps the state needed to take to properly treat its water, those necessary (EPA) actions were not taken as quickly as they should have been."Doing everything they were legally obligated to do but choosing snail mail over faxing isn't quite the same screw-up as choosing to poison your citizens to save a few million. We're well aware the EPA could be faster. That's what happens when you don't give a federal organization enough power over their state-level counterparts. Also, if the state hadn't been lying about the river in the first place, the EPA could have been far more effective.</comment>

<comment>So who gets leaders of the year ?  Detroit or Flynt ?  Gonna be a close one.</comment>

<comment>Lansing, not Detroit</comment>

<comment>Sorry.</comment>

<comment>imo this problem would have not happened if more democrats were involved</comment>

<comment>I bash the hell out of Republicans, but I'm not going to give the Democratic leadership of Flint a pass. They did vote 7-1 for the same move (even if the vote didn't matter). What makes me wonder is who convinced them this was a good idea? I'm guessing it was the state-appointed group saying "oh yeah, it's fine, here are numbers you don't understand from a test you wouldn't know we conducted incorrectly even if we had".</comment>

<comment>No, the council did not vote to use river water. They voted in 2011 to commission a study for using river water. They did not vote in 2014 to change as the matter was never put to them.</comment>

<comment>That makes more sense then. It did seem odd that the council would vote on a decision where they had no authority.</comment>

<comment>This hand-wringing is silly.  Private water donations are filling the gap until the municipal water supply is clean- it's not a long-term thing.  Yes, someone like Bill Gates has the money to influence the charities he funds, and you can question how his personal views and biases affect that, but I don't see how it applies in this case.</comment>

<comment>Walmart, Target, and others sent supplies to New Orleans, including water after Katrina.</comment>

<comment>Those BASTARDS how dare corporations donate water to needy peopleThis is just the first step towards a fascist takeover of the government </comment>

<comment>The private sector has no business being there.  They need to be seized immediately by the government before they screw something up!</comment>

<comment>This is satire, right? This has to be Swift-level satire.</comment>

<comment>He's an idiot. </comment>

<comment>Poe's Law.</comment>

<comment>It's an attempt at satire, but I'd hardly call it "Swift-level". More like an IowaHawk- or DailyCaller-level attempt.If private companies had been in charge of Flint's water and made the change, they could always go bankrupt and their CEOs probably wouldn't be touched (especially if they'd already moved to Abu Dabhi). Governments can't do that and politicians aren't as likely to move to Abu Dabhi.</comment>

<comment>My questions is where were the big corps for years before this incident in communities like Flint.Jobs for average people have disappeared in huge sections of our country leaving workers hopeless and local governments broke with no tax base to draw from.These companies suck the wealth from our once prosperous middle class, shift labor overseas, hide their profits in tax shelters or pay teams of lawyers to avoid taxes altogether.. then they come in to somewhere like Flint and hand out water bottles to people being poisoned who have no jobs and fading options to improve their situation... gee thanks.Ironically, the water bottles are a tax write off </comment>

<comment>The big corp your talking about is GM...its too bad the Flintstones couldn't make ends meet on $65 an hour</comment>

<comment>65$ an hour?Are you suggesting that GM factory workers made around 140k a year?Might want to run your math again.Regardless, any American wage is just not acceptable costs for these companies anymore. Not when the Chinese or Mexico laborers can do it for a few bucks a day.Ask Trump. Americans aren't the only workers building his hotels and definitely not working in his resort kitchens. Of course, you don't hear him talk about that.</comment>

<comment>$65 was the fully loaded wage rate, it included first dollar health care</comment>

<comment>LOLWrong person to respond to.I'm an accountant bud. I know what a full loaded wage rate is.A fully loaded rate is used in production accounting and has little to do with an employees take home pay. It includes company overhead costs, and employer's share of benefits and can sometimes be more than double the actual wage paid to an employee due to high electric costs, minimal square footage, etc.. in that employees department.It includes both direct costs of production and indirect. Hazmat fees related to an employees work area, expensive machinery, etc..Also, a fully loaded rate can be calculated in different ways by companies making it completely irrelevant to the actual take home pay of an employee.If an employee was actually compensated to the tune of 65$ per hour their W2 would show 140k in earnings. There has never been and never will be a production line employee making 6 figures a year.</comment>

<comment>Lots of skilled Trades guys hit 6 figures..... and a fully loaded wage rate is what that employee costs the company, useful for deciding to relocate...</comment>

<comment>Skilled trades guys that own their business maybe...with employees and various industrial clients... otherwise no.You are correct that the fully loaded wage is useful for a company to decide to relocate, but your original comment was that a UAW WORKER couldn't live on 65$ / hr..</comment>

<comment>I managed a large auto supplier mfg facility and it was typical for a few toolmakers and PLC guys to notch a $100k with their OT. Yes the loaded rate was over $65 per hour for line workers and they wanted more.... Health care is compensation, especially when you have ZERO copays...</comment>

<comment>They never made $65 an hour. That was a lie told by Fox by including all past pensions and benefits into 40 hours a week.They skewed the numbers further by comparing them to brand new factories from foreign companies that hadn't been in the US long enough to even have a pension-age workforce. Even then, those workers made similar wages (in the mid-$20 range).The issue with the UAW had more to do with executives wanting to take wages from the workers, but accept their own exorbitant pay raises.</comment>

<comment>You are correct. Using a fully loaded rate for any job to suggest it is their take home pay is false.A fully loaded wage rate is used internally for production accounting. It has nothing to do with take home pay for an employee.</comment>

<comment>The interesting thing is that the real wages were pretty standard for a factory worker. US automakers didn't lose because their workers were paid properly, they lost through a combination of cheap-quality bland car designs and gas prices destroying truck and SUV sales.The UAW was just a scapegoat for bad management that was unwilling to admit they have no clue how to run a car company.</comment>

<comment>I agree.The American auto industry was just facing a changing period of consumer demand and they couldn't keep up or evolve to stay profitable...The unions are always the enemy in the end though. Elite capitalists are disgusted at the idea that their workforce is important enough that they should share their wealth with them.Look at the way Walmart publicly deals with their workers - forced into part time only hours, cut benefits, invest millions in technology for automated cashier terminals to replace them... its deplorable. That is why unions have to come in and fight for those wages.However, at Walmart if anyone starts to even act like they are organizing they just get fired...In my experience, its almost a uniquely American attitude these days. European companies seem to at least be more willing to invest in their workforce and recognize the value of keeping your employees paid well and functioning at their best.In my area, the only good paying jobs are at foreign owned factories. We have a German owned wind turbine blade factory - pays very well, good benefits, great place to work. We have a French owned corn processing plant, pays well, good benefits, the workers are unionized but generally there is no dispute...In contrast, the American owned companies pay far less, have constant turnover, and require mandatory 6-7 day a week OT... some of them don't get days off for 3 weeks or more.. most of the workers are unionized, but are in constant dispute and right to work laws limit their ability to bargain effectively... </comment>

<comment>I wholeheartedly agree with you. A good take on the state of unions right now is the episode of Inside Man that Morgan Spurlock did. It was pathetic the lengths that Walmart went to crush the unionization protestors. The Boeing union attempt in South Carolina is worse, as that's nothing but state condoned violence being used to union bust.</comment>

<comment>The only one-industry town with permanent job security is Washington DC.</comment>

<comment>They're not just a write-off, they're practically free good publicity. The way I see it, even the Yakuza helps out in Japan during natural disasters. That doesn't absolve them of their crimes. Walmart would have to send quite a lot of bottles to match the damage they've done to the US economy.</comment>

<comment>LONEWACKO!!</comment>

<comment>"Earl of Sandwich" (/disqus_PYUSWloMy2/) has no counterargument to anything I wrote (or anything I've *ever* written anywhere) so it simply says "LONEWACKO!!" in reference to my former domain name. See this for other examples of libertarian fascists never being able to present a valid counterargument to anything I've ever written:24ahead.com/s/reason-magazine</comment>

<comment>Satire it is.</comment>

<comment>The author may wish to consider that fixing the problems with the infrastructure isn't going to happen overnight, and there is an immediate need for fresh drinking water - a necessity so basic, that this is completely inconceivable inside the United States. Rather than looking the gift horse in the mouth, and trying to figure out how we can furtherregulate gifting, horses, and equine dentistry in the future, why not at least thank Corporate America for stepping up where our own government has failed us?</comment>

<comment>You don't seem to draw the connection. Corporate America has left these Americans behind.Once thriving towns like Flint are broke and hopeless as these companies 'step up' by sending jobs overseas, funneling profits in tax shelters and paying billions to PAC's to bribe our government to hold down wages, demonize unions and the poor, and support corporate monopolies that drive up prices right in front of our face.Our failing government and Corporate America are the same people. Come on now... its right in front of you.Oh wow, they're out handing out water bottles? Gee thanks. Why don't they invest in these communities? Tell their executives they're going to have to sell their 4th vacation home and yacht and actually pay their employees a fair wage and benefits? Or at least keep their labor force in the US..Then maybe a city like Flint would have the tax base to support facilities and management of a necessity so basic as drinking water.Ironically, those water bottles are yet another tax deduction for these companies. You can't make this up.</comment>

<comment>Well said.</comment>

<comment>What do you expect? The government messed this up. The problem began with the people of Flint and was made worse when the people of Detroit sold them down the river. (Literally). Certainly the governor's office didn't make things better. Nor did Obama's EPA.</comment>

<comment>How did Detroit sell Flint down the river? It was the EM that decided not to continue the contract or negotiate a short term contract.</comment>

<comment>Detroit charged too much. If they charged a decent amount, Flint wouldn't need to try to save money.</comment>

<comment>So what is a fair price? The Bankruptcy Judge said they couldn't subsidize the suburbs.</comment>

<comment>"In September 2011, an engineering report to the Flint City Council said that the most expensive option for providing citizens with water was continuing to buy it from Detroit." http://www.crainsdetroit.com/a...</comment>

<comment>Analysis indicates that the cost of supplying water from the Flint River on a continuous basis will be greater than the proposed KWA Raw Water Supply Contract, but less than continued supply from Detroit. http://dwsdupdate.blogspot.com...</comment>

<comment>This is an easy problem to solve, it only takes MONEY, which the people of Flint don't have. Tax dollars pay to maintain a water dept. Looks like Flint never spent any tax dollars for maintenance. The population is now reduced, tax revenues are down, and they have ignore the repair and maintenance of their own water supply. Where do they get to money for repairs ? Could it be higher taxes ? Where do they get the money to buy more expensive water ? Might it be taxes ? The problem has grown worst, for the metal pipes, in people's homes must be replaced. I bet that also costs MONEY. Perhaps Trump or Sanders has a solution ? Govt. needs to wisely spend tax dollars. This usually didn't happen in Detroit or Flint. Hell, it rarely happens in Wash. D.C.</comment>

<comment>Too bad Flint didn't have an Art Collection....</comment>

<comment>You are correct. Money is the issue.Austerity politics at work. You can't spend tax dollars that aren't there. You can't generate tax dollars when companies move jobs out of the country and keep wages flat.When people give up and don't work, or when decent jobs aren't available there is no income tax revenue. Key word is 'income.'This is conservative economics at its finest. Give the suits and corps whatever they want, send jobs overseas, cut taxes and remove government oversight, and let everyone fend for themselves.Its American individualism, right? It's trickle down, it's tough love...It's really just failure at the most basic human level. Little kids with brain damage, pregnant mothers terrified, and dead people from legionnaires.</comment>

<comment>redshark, long before companies left Detroit and Flint, local govt. wasted tax revenue. The city admin. spent too much on pensions and fringe benefits for govt. workers. Believe me, they should have a pension, good pay, and even benefits; but it was Cadillac pensions and benefits. These pay and benefit packages were rewarded with votes. Also understand that companies wouldn't eliminate defined pension plans or move over seas if our govt. our elected officials had a brain.The Ds are as bad as the Rs. Both parties have diminished the middle class. Wasn't it Clinton that that enacted NAFTA and perhaps Bush helped China get into the WTO ? (two bad moves) BOTH parties push for more trade agreements that result in a loss of jobs and an ever greater trade deficit.Both parties endorse more immigration, legal and illegal, which drives down wages.It's liberal and conservative economics that tear at the fabric of our society. Open your eyes a little wider and see liberals can destroy economies as well as conservatives.I'm hoping TRUMP or SANDERS gets to be President. Anyone but one of the anointed ones.</comment>

<comment>We are in agreement on this Magyart.I hold no party close to my heart. Or my nose. My eyes are open.Clinton's banking policy also contributed to the 08 crash as much as irresponsible Wall Street fraud.It is a two party problem.But the GOP are so bold they come right out and advertise they work for the interest of money and corporate sponsored theft from American people. They truly believe this should be our country's future (actually, I'm not sure they know what they believe) and have no concern for average working people.Further, their religious extremism has no place in modern society. Christian extremists are no different than our Islamic boogeymen they have crafted as the villain of the day.Trump, the TV star billionaire, has zero experience or credibility to be POTUS. Putin, China, and the global community would laugh in our face. He can't manage the US from his twitter feed. He's a joke.Sanders is the only option for a change. And he happens to be running Democrat.</comment>

<comment>I'm tempted to register as a Dem., so I can vote for Sanders in OH's primary. Keep in mind, Trump has more executive experience than Obama, when he won election.If Trump would win, I hope he sounds himself with experts, not self centered politicians and makes good decisions. If Trump doesn't make it, I'm inclined to vote for Sanders. I think he's a radical, but we need the right kind of radical, lol.</comment>

<comment>If you think Sanders is radical Magyart, you are mistaken.  He is a self-identified Socialist Democrat advocating for more taxes and even bigger government - the opposite of radical.  More of the same old nanny state.</comment>

<comment>I would urge you to consider it.I don't think he can accomplish many of the very progressive changes he champions, but if he makes progress it will be better than nothing.I would have more support for Trump if he wouldn't pull the ridiculous publicity stunts and speak with such hate. It's pretty easy to see he doesn't really care about making it to the White House. This is just all good publicity for him and his next set of hotels or reality TV endeavors. I can't identify with someone who states that we should isolate a certain ethnic group or religious group and ban them or treat them as enemies in our country. That kind of hate is the thing the US was built as a symbol to stand against. In my opinion, his campaign ended with those comments.</comment>

<comment>So, Redshark22, you think Sanders plan of higher taxes and even bigger government is change?  Think again.  I agree it is a two-party problem.  Keep holding your nose closed and your eyes open.</comment>

<comment>Will Tyler, bigger or smaller government isn't what's important. Those are Fox News talking points that are meaningless.What's important is who that government works for.European nations who put their government to work for the people, both rich and poor, are amazing places to live and work. I know because I've been to them and work with them daily.Big government has lifted this country out of depression and set the stage for a national railroad and highway system that spurred our industrial boom years. Big government has funded medical and scientific research that has saved millions of lives through vaccines and breakthrough treatments and medications.You have been conditioned to think big government is bad. It is only bad if it takes from us and gives nothing back, which is the situation we are starting to see.Conservatives spout a lot about big government - stay out of our lives! But try to take away their police force (or hold them accountable for crimes), or decrease their jails, or even mention cutting military funding.. then all of a sudden big government is OK when it involves jailing or killing people we throw billions at it. When it comes to our school system, public health facilities, social safety nets, etc.. then its called SOCIALISM. Buzz words, meaningless and misleading..Big oil, big pharma, banking and the insurance industry are who our government works for now, not us. Hell, they are even the same people! They walk out of a Goldman Sachs boardroom and into our regional federal banks. They stroll out of big pharma companies and into the FDA, all of them with an agenda to keep passing the money UP.They are literally bribing and stealing from us right in front of our faces, yet there are droves of people lining up to support a clear corporate puppet like Ted Cruz or Jeb Bush, or Hilary... its shameful.Whether or not Bernie can make all the changes happen (and I am skeptical he can), he is the only candidate with the credibility and drive to attempt it.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, part of the problem is also that population growth has leveled off, and places like Flint are harbingers of what is to come. A shrinking population base to support expenditures. The problem is manageable. If acknowledged.</comment>

<comment>The city of Flint spends 1/3 of its tax revenues on retirement costs for its former public employees.The unions took all of the money. </comment>

<comment>Phase three. The corporate take over of government caused this deadly debacle. Now after the results are in, we are supposed to be gaga and wobbly in the knees for the corporate PR guys shilling for headlines?The cycle is complete.. Open media mouth insert hook...</comment>

<comment>Exactly.These companies could care less about average Americans, part of the reason these communities are in bad shape is corporate outsourcing and their billion dollar crusades to drive wages down and prices up.But they'll show up to hand out water bottles. And take the tax deduction for charitable contribution.</comment>

<comment>How exactly do you blame corporations for the EPA's failure to act on unsafe test results from a municipal water supply that were submitted to it as required by the Safe Drinking Water Act?  It isn't like you had a private water test lab faking results or an evil private water company sending in samples from a known clean source.</comment>

<comment>Snyder made the choice. His un-elected hacks made the decision. Of course it is part of the mantra to divert blame in true cowardly corporate hack fashion...</comment>

<comment>Why are you giving a free pass to the regulators who received these out of compliance tests and failed to act?  Oh, right, they aren't Republicans.</comment>

<comment>Let's not be silly here John. It has been the mantra of the Republican party, for quite  some time, to flog endlessly that the business acumen of the corporate "business" party has all the answers.The republicans are demanding the need to "privatize" our government even though massive corporate bankruptcies failures get shrugged off.  From Kenny Boy at Enron to banking to autos the citizens are becoming aware of the silliness of tat Reaganomic.Now  children are going to be sick from this austerity hype. These sociopaths have no place in the public sector.  It is the end result of  a lead in to another junk product by corporate hacks.The American people are slow but they are catching on...http://www.gallup.com/poll/159...</comment>

<comment>Corporate bankruptcies get shrugged off because they represent the free market clearing itself of failed entities and because everyone who dealt with those companies did so voluntarily.  Government failure is so heinous to libertarians because it is often a forced relationship where we had no choice but to engage with it.You view Flint as some failure of austerity yet you probably have no idea this exact same thing happened in Washington D.C. in 2001 and Providence in 2002 and New York City in 2001 and 2002 also had lead levels exceeding legal limits.  You call it austerity while at the same time States like Illinois and California are tens of billions behind in pension contributions and the National Highway System is many years and many billions behind on necessary maintenance.  And it isn't because of austerity.  On the contrary the government has never spent more money than it is spending now.  It just doesn't spend it on infrastructure, it wastes it on wars or studying why overweight lesbians have less sex.</comment>

<comment>silly..</comment>

<comment>What about Omni Consumer Products?</comment>

<comment>They should partner with the Weyland-Yutani Corporation on this one.</comment>

<comment>This is great. It's good that big companies are pitching in..However, where have these big, generous, compassionate companies been for more than two decades now for communities like Flint? For communities all over our country where jobs have disappeared and wages have flat lined?Flint's tax base is so poor that their local government operates at a bare minimum. Cutting costs becomes a priority. I am not in any way excusing the actions of all layers of government involved in this catastrophe, but you have to look at the root of the problem not just the symptoms.When you have a community that is so poor (and right wing austerity politics decreasing the role of government), the tax revenue is minimal and things that should be priority number one for a local government become a financial problem.Similar to Baltimore and towns all across the Midwest. Companies are shutting down businesses, factories, moving jobs overseas and fighting to keep wages low, cutting costs, 'decreasing the role of government' in our lives, and other forms of this right wing nonsense.Our workers have to choose to sign up for welfare help, take part time only jobs structured to keep pay low with little or no benefits, etc...How could the local government of Flint finance changing the outdated lead piping? Or how can they afford to build a modern water filtration system and hire qualified staff to ensure safe drinking water? The answer is they can't.. they are broke.Start investing in our communities both rich and poor. Stop the corporate giants from rigging the game and making billions by sending their manufacturing overseas and leaving our communities out in the cold and our workers hopeless.Lift people up from the bottom and you will see it flow through local government and upward. This would never happen in a wealthier area of Michigan. The residents complaints would have been taking seriously and it would have been corrected, this is our fascist government politics at work. This is what the GOP plan for our government would look like nationwide. Bright spots of shining wealth pocketing our nation right next to desperately poor areas where people fend for themselves without the support of what conservatives consider government 'entitlements.' Does this now include even our basic needs such as safe drinking water, adequate housing, schools, and infrastructure. These are 'handouts' now?Wake up people.You have to have government services. You have to have taxes to pay for it and we need stop the oligarchy and make corporations invest in the country they profit from, not just their shareholders and themselves.</comment>

<comment>"... This is what the GOP plan for our government would look like nationwide. .."."...Stop the corporate giants from rigging the game and making billions by sending their manufacturing overseas and leaving our communities out in the cold and our workers hopeless...".Look at you. YOU are also a part of the problem- because you cannot or will not recognize the obvious fact that the problem you speak about is bipartisan.By persisting with a wrongheaded and simpleminded partisan POV - people cannot ever "wake up" the way you would like.</comment>

<comment>I agree. We are ALL part of the problem.We ALL need to push our government to work for us. I hate the two party system. Neither party seems to do what is needed.I'm simply pointing out that this type of government and economy in Flint is created by GOP strategies - give the corps and suits whatever they want, cut government services, lower tax rates...What's your suggestion for avoiding these issues?. I'm sure you have a very bipartisan answer since you seem so offended by my GOP reference.</comment>

<comment>You just repeated your mistake. You have the mistaken impression that corporate welfare/crony capitalism is a "Republican" thing.</comment>

<comment>Yeah I didn't figure you had any suggestions.Thanks for pointing out 'my' mistakes.I believe Hilary could be considered a Wall Street employee, crony capitalism is a bi-partisan issue, yes.But you rarely see it as a directly stated political platform like you do from the GOP..If you feel you're providing something interesting to this discussion you might have a career in congress.As an independent of course since you're obviously so 'bipartisan'</comment>

<comment>Try to educate yourself a bit before you post.</comment>

<comment>Educate myself with what? Enlighten me wise one.The GOP has candidates running tax cutting, corporate sponsored platforms right in everyone's faces, with most the candidates sponsored by fracking billionaires, oil companies, or Wall Street... advocating against unions, against minimum wage increases..You're trying to criticize my statement that the GOP is an openly admitted corporate crony party? Is the sky also not blue?You know what.. its not worth it..I agree we have a lot of problems on both sides. Hopefully we can overcome these issues.Good talk.</comment>

<comment>Ignore spuddie; he's on track to posting 15,000 comments in his first year on this website and none of them have ever displayed an education or blamed Republicans for anything.  Just a right-wing hyper-troll.</comment>

<comment>Its their rhetoric. Don't believe your lying ears.</comment>

<comment>It is and has always been. The decision to move to toxic water came AFTER Flint's elected leaders were replaced by the governor's appointees.</comment>

<comment>You realize Flint has been controlled by Democrats (and Unions) for all those years the pipes were rotting under their feet..</comment>

<comment>Lead pipes exist in many cities in the US. Not too long ago Washington DC itself had a lead crisis related to its outdated water system...By ensuring the water itself is not corrosive enough to damage the pipes, the pipes can be used safely.You can try to shift the blame either way, but this is a government failure all around. Dem and Repub.We need to realize that a certain level of government funding and services are necessary and we need to create an economy and tax structure that supports it. The problem is that's called Socialism to most people. Fox News says so...  must be true.It sends the masses into hysteria suggesting that taxes may be necessary..We seem to think we can pay our workers pathetic wages with no benefits, charge little or no taxes and somehow support a top tier first world nation's infrastructure.But as long as the DOW keeps climbing we must be rich right?</comment>

<comment>Blacks?Are you serious?Please present one fact to support how the black community 'took over' this town or had any part of switching the water supply and not following up on its safety.

<comment>like I said, name one city they have not destroyed after they took over. You can't.</comment>

<comment>Name one city that blacks 'took over.' Like they are some mercenary military force? You are retarded.So you're saying a group of black people in Flint appointed the emergency manager? Made the decision to switch the water supply?Name one uneducated racist that doesn't live in reality - Phil Greene.</comment>

<comment>People vote with their feet. You can't stop them.</comment>

<comment>At least you admit your racism and belief in white nationalist enclaves, that's hard to do in modern America.</comment>

<comment>No it is easy and it has happened all over America and will continue. Think, Detroit, East St. louis IL, Atlanta, Flint, Camden, NJ, Jackson MS, St Louis, Chicago, LA, Birmingham, AL, New Orleans, Cleveland, need I go on. It is not racism it is history.</comment>

<comment>Awww you upvoted your own comment. That's sweet.Bless your heart.</comment>

<comment>It's not a race issue. It's a poverty issue. The areas you list have some of the poorest neighborhoods, biggest police forces and archaic laws. All this stuff goes hand in hand with poverty.If you went back far enough in time there would idiots just like you talking the same way about the Irish or the Polish, or the Italians.You can't think outside your deep seated racist programming. The wealthy elite of the world want us looking down on the blacks, or the Irish or the gays, keeps the herd like yourself occupied so they can rob you blind and you still go to polls and vote for them.Whatever it takes so you can feel above someone.Even the poorest white man can accept his situation if he has a black man to look down on.. or Irish, or gay, etc..Do you follow me?</comment>

<comment>Visit the above named Cities as I have and see the destruction for yourself and get back to me. Try East St Louis, it is hard to believe the total ruin of a Town, by blacks.</comment>

<comment>Been to East St Louis. I'm a lifelong Cardinals fan so I'm very familiar with that area. You are correct it is shocking if you accidentally go across the river (which I've done on multiple occasions), its like you've been transported to a 3rd world country. Abandoned buildings. No businesses for miles, crumbling roads and houses..Blaming the race that happens to be the remaining habitants of an area isn't quite identifying the problem though.There are places all over the country where a majority black population exists that are thriving. What about the town where Dylann Roof decided to walk into a church filled with respectable black men and women of that area, one was a US senator, and open fire.Who is wreaking havoc in that town? Not the blacks.I believe where there are jobs and opportunity, fair policing, and strong leaders you will see people thrive and lift themselves up.Where there is little opportunity, drug war driven policing where young blacks are jailed and fined into despair for small infractions like a suspended license, or possession of marijuana, or failure to pay fines for all of the above infractions you see people become desperate. They sell drugs to make a living, they drink in excess to numb their pain, they get high to escape, they run from the police to stay out of jail, they create gangs to form their own community and violence becomes the norm...Chances are if you or are grew up as a small child in that area we would be one of these same 'blacks' that you blame for everything. Its not a genetic problem. Its an environmental problem.The world isn't black and white, man. There aren't good guys and bad guys. Only a thousand shades of gray.Open your mind a little. Speaking like you do only makes the problems worse.</comment>

<comment>Now that you have rationalized East St. Louis, rationalize the rest of the towns I mentioned that have succumbed to black rule and do name the town that they have improved. You can't.</comment>

<comment>Hahahaha, 'succumbed to black rule'What is this game of thrones? You're entertaining at least.How many of the towns you list have black city officials or government? Present me with that fact and you may have an argument..Like Ferguson, MO - another town that you would say 'succumbed to black rule'? - entire city council of white men, white mayor, white police force, white city director....Is that the 'black rulers' you're referring to?</comment>

<comment>Not a town I mentioned at all. You did.</comment>

<comment>We won't stop you, anyway.</comment>

<comment>I am pretty sure filters can't filter dissolved lead.</comment>

<comment>Reverse Osmosis can.  The Army has filtration systems (the Navy does, too) that can do the job.</comment>

<comment>I'm no water expert, but one point is not clear to me. Flint has returned in the last couple of months to the Detroit municipal water source, which it had for 30 years previous to trying to save money with Flint River water.So, why are they telling residents to drink bottled water? The tap water is the same now as they had for 30 years.</comment>

<comment>The pipes are corroded, and leaching lead into the water.  So it's not safe </comment>

<comment>It was safe for 30 years of non-corrosive Detroit water, why is it not safe now for non-corrosive Detroit water?</comment>

<comment>it wasn't safe, Flint had not tested the water until they switched sources, now they know they've been poisoning themselves for years..</comment>

<comment>Not sure that's correct. Here is info on how added phosphates restore the interior coating on lead service pipes to prevent high lead concentrations in the water. When the phosphate deposits on the inside of the pipe increase, the lead in the water goes down and the lead load of the residents will return over time to what they had before this fiasco.------------"Detroit had been using phosphates — a type of salt containing phosphorus — for years to control lead; the method has been used successfully by water systems across the country since the 1990s. But when Flint switched water sources, it didn't add corrosion controls, as the law requires for water systems that serve more than 50,000 people. DEQ officials later acknowledged that they wrongly used the protocol for smaller water systems.Experts said the more corrosive river water wore down the mineral layer inside Flint's aging pipes and began leaching lead into the water. If lead concentrations exceed 15 ppb in more than 10% of customer taps sampled, the water system operators must take additional steps to control corrosion.Detroit adds 1 milligram of phosphate to every liter of water it treats. On Dec. 9, Flint began adding an additional 2.5 milligrams per liter to help accelerate the buildup of the mineral layer.Lead levels can be expected to begin falling two to three weeks after the phosphates are added and fall faster as the mineral layer builds up, said David Cornwall,  a former Michigan State University professor who serves as a technical adviser to the National Drinking Water Advisory Council. But that can also vary.For example, all water systems have areas where water flow is low, Cornwall said. That means it takes longer for the new treated water to reach those pipes."There are always lots of storage tanks in a distribution system," said Cornwall, who is now president of EE&T, a consulting engineering firm based in Newport News, Va.  "Water can sit in those tanks for days. You've got to get this new boosted orthophosphates out to the whole system."from http://www.freep.com/story/new...</comment>

<comment>it became unsafe when they added more chemicals agents to the water to compensate for the pollution added to the supply when the switched to the river water.</comment>

<comment>The pipes are ruined.  All the pipes have to be ripped out and replaced.  That's every pipe from the water plant for each individual house.</comment>

<comment>might as well the roads all need resurfacing..</comment>

<comment>You could pour bottle water into those pipes and they wouldnt be safe. IT has nothing to do with switching water sources, this is an example of total neglect on the part of city leadership since the 70's...</comment>

<comment>The pipes are ruined because the change to a contaminated water source, prompted the increase of corossive chemical agents, which hastened the leeching of lead into the water entering the home. Get a clue.</comment>

<comment>The non Detroit water reacted with the pipes and caused mass lead leaching. If I understand it correctly, the corrosion can't be reversed, not with any amount of flushing the pipes with good water.</comment>

<comment>Here is the solution to the Flint problem.  President Obama should activate and deploy Army Reserve "Water Filtration" units to Flint.  Those units are company sized and can supply clean water from some of the most foul water sources on the planet.  Additionally, a battalion of Army Reserve transportation trucks can transport the refined water to the people of Flint.There is a Army Reserve Transportation Battalion up in Bay City, Michigan and they are only about 50 miles from Flint.  Additionally, there are Army National Guard distribution assets in Midland, Michigan, about 75 miles away.  The closest filtration unit is in Columbus, Ohio but they could start refining water for Flint by this weekend if activated.  The USAF could transport the water filtration units into Bishop Airport which is just by Flint and large enough to take C-5 and C-17 cargo aircraft.A good Brigade staff of Army Logistics officers could make the plan for distribution of water inside of a day.  A Battalion of water filtration units could supply all of Flint.  A Battalion of Army Trucks could distribute water to all of Flint.Government, get off your ass and fix this.  Put out warning orders and get going.  There is no reason this isn't fixed by this weekend.  </comment>

<comment>Here is the solution to the Flint problem, build refugee camps to house the citizens outside of the city until they can be relocated.....This is a perfect example of people getting exactly the government they deserve!</comment>

<comment>The people didn't cause this mess.  It was three idiots.  An acting city manager didn't do his job.  A water plant manager didn't do his job.  The head of the Michigan DEQ didn't do their job.I can see NO REASON WHY CHILDREN ARE GIVEN WATER WITH LEAD IN IT!I'm a republican but this is Inexcusable.  First we fix the problem.  Second, some jerks need to do some serious jail time..</comment>

<comment>while you decide who should do jail time lets get the residents out of this hell hole...</comment>

<comment>In the middle of Winter in Michigan?  Please...Get the Army in there, give them water, then decide what to do with the city.Are you just trying to be obtuse?</comment>

<comment>If the Federal government can pay to relocate Syrian refugees then why not its own citizens? Flint is every bit as bad as war torn Syria!</comment>

<comment>Yes</comment>

<comment>That's probably the best solution I have heard anyone float so far.This is a dire situation that calls for real action. A bold move like that it ought to be handled until something more permanent can be developed. Kinda how you would respond to a crisis in a 3rd world country (and it pains me horribly to say that).</comment>

<comment>Logistics... it's pure logistics.  A person needs 4 gallons of water a day which includes cooking, washing, drinking, and cleaning clothes.A bottle of water is 16 ounces, that's two cups.  It's a joke.This situation drives me bat-crazy.  Why isn't anybody getting off their ass?</comment>

<comment>I'd say four gallons is a bare minimum. If that was your ration, it'd be tough to stretch it far enough to cover all that, but possible (barely).Best part about this? Flint is still billing people for water that they can't use. Classy.</comment>

<comment>Obama can't do that without Congresses permission.but if he declared states of emergency Synder could deploy national guard who probably have similar options</comment>

<comment>I used to work as a full timer for the Army Reserve.  Obama could activate the Reserve units if he wants.  Congress would have to authorize additional funding past two weeks.  But Obama is completely in his rights of telling the Army to send Army Reserve Units into Flint to purify water.  I could come up with a rotating scheme to have the reserve units run it for a year and not have anybody do more than three weeks on active duty and staff a battalion of water purification personnel.Snyder has the Army Guard but if he activates them it comes out of the State Government's budget, not the Feds.  There are various budget tricks that can be done but that's WAY beyond the scope of this conversation. Anyway, most of the Army Guard units in Michigan are Combat or Combat support assets.  90% of all Army Guard dollars come from the Federal Government.The Army Reserve has transportation units in Bay City and Traverse City.Anyway, you're in an argument with a former full timer who used to live not but 30 miles from that area.  I used to coordinate personnel actions for a good chunk of the Guard and Reservists in mid-Michigan.</comment>

<comment>The National Guard is already doing this, though their configuration is a bit different than Reserve units.</comment>

<comment>Flint is going have to dig up and replace ALL the lead service lines, it's a BIG job, but for a city of 100k, it should be able to be done by the end of the year.</comment>

<comment>It should have been done before they hyperchloirdated the water after replacing their supply with polluted poison</comment>

<comment>Situations like this undermine the fundamental legitimacy of the state. When the wealthiest, most materially powerful nation in the history of man can essentially turn into a hollow state with respect to the immediate needs of even just a small portion of its citizenry, it raises questions of its utility and validity in their entirety.</comment>

<comment>Yup, Take care of yourself, because IF you rely on the Govt., they will let you down when you need them the most.</comment>

<comment>Republicans run on the government being wasteful and incompetent, then get elected and prove the point.</comment>

<comment>There's that.</comment>

<comment>http://reason.com/blog/2016/01...</comment>

<comment>Democrats owned and created the disaster in Flint.</comment>

<comment>Embrace the decline and let your inner nihilist fly!</comment>

<comment>And yet you people ask why I have guns.</comment>

<comment>Imagine that, the private sector solving problems better than the bloated bureaucracy of government can. Those evil corporations and their profits! Berndawg must be grinding his teeth over this one.</comment>

<comment>Solving the problem is replacing the pipes. I don't see anyone stepping up to do that.</comment>

<comment>Make no mistake, this is nothing but a publicity stunt by big business. In reality, water bottle donations by business or charities, will never be a substitute of a government function of providing public goods. None Of these businesses will step up to replace or even repair the water infrastructure, which is what is required. The real irony is that this was caused by idiots who wanted to run their government like a business, i.e cost cutting. Elect Rupubes, and you get water poisoning.</comment>
