<comment>Religious liberty or 'religious liberty' (if you're a liberal) is effectively dead. The only question is how far liberals take this. Are they going to close churches that refuse to marry gays? Are they going to close religious schools that refuse to employ gays? It's really up to them now.</comment>

<comment>Typical made up garbage,.  There never has been, nor will there ever be, a situation like you describe above.You darn well know the difference between private/religious institutions and those supported by public tax dollars.You are clearly gay obsessed and a vile homophobe. You could have given a much simpler fraudulent example: forcing the Catholic Church to employ female priests. But, as anyone can clearly see, this bogus sense of persecution has never been about religion, it has always been about hatred of gays.</comment>

<comment>Women are not intrinsically disordered.And I never claimed persecution. Find a straw man somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>You need to look up the definition of strawman. You implied persecution</comment>

<comment>Attacking institutions is not the same as attacking people!</comment>

<comment>Attacking institutions is not the same as attacking people!Uummm, a difference only in the name of the target.</comment>

<comment>Catholicism survived the Reformation, Henry 8th, and the French Revolution. We will survive the loss of a tax exemption.I prefer that people have to pay a social or financial penalty to be a Christian. Anything that pushes the lukewarm away from the faith can only help strengthen the solidarity of those of us who remain.</comment>

<comment>Ahhh, yes ... the holy exclusivity of the unwavering rightness of spiritual belief.Try to remember the simple fact that a vast majority of the population in this Democracy -- or Constitutional Republic, if you prefer -- want you and everybody else to keep your gawd-damned Gawd out of the public arena and in that motley collection of the myriad churches, temples, and synagogues where He or She belongs.</comment>

<comment>No. Atheists are more hated than even Muslims.</comment>

<comment>Universal hatred from every disgusting, lying fanatic on the planet IS quite an accomplishment. IIDSSM</comment>

<comment>Spectacles A**hole.</comment>

<comment>it's because churches teach that atheists are immoral child molesters, and as you know, religious people will believe anything.</comment>

<comment>"Vast majority?  Hmm.I think most oppose the imposition of a religion upon others.  But most also support the acknowledgement of a deity of some sort in public life.</comment>

<comment>Real A**hole.</comment>

<comment>Since no legislation forces churches to marry same-sex partners, nor any contemplated legislation, nor even a whisper of any laws intruding upon religious ceremonies, you have invoked a strawman argument.Furthermore, you have to believe in 'natural law' to also believe any consensual sexual act between partners is intrinsically disordered. Since I don't believe in that 'natural law', your belief in it means nothing to me.And, by the way, the Catholic Church's teaching is not that any people are intrinsically disordered, only certain acts.That said, perhaps you are 'intrinsically disordered' because you believe your religious convictions should override the law itself, amounting to a claim to an authority that absolves you of political responsibility in your everyday life..</comment>

<comment>The Solicitor General said in testimony to the Supreme Court that Churches could lose tax-exempt status for refusing to marry gays. Losing that status would force some churches (mostly poorer black and Latino) to close. Is the Solicitor General a strawman?Is he?And where do I say my religious convictions should override the law? Straw Man!</comment>

<comment>Justice Alito asked — “would the same apply to a university or a college if it opposed same-sex marriage?” Solicitor General Verrilli replied:“You know, I — I don’t think I can answer that question without knowing more specifics, but it’s certainly going to be an issue. I — I don’t deny that. I don’t deny that, Justice Alito. It is — it is going to be an issue.”Neither the question nor the answer was about marrying in church ceremonies. The reality is that no religion is being told it must perform same-sex marriages, and there is absolutely no way the the law can be constructed constitutionally to force that.</comment>

<comment>Threatening the tax exemption of a non profit enterprise is extortion. </comment>

<comment>Even Scalia would probably disagree with you on this. He once wrote that  “The mere possession of religious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities.”Governments should not be offering tax-exemptions to any institution which does not discharge its political responsibilities to treat all as equal before and under the law. If a religious institution does not want to do so, it should receive neither direct nor indirect government funding. And tax exemptions amount to indirect funding by taxpayers.</comment>

<comment>The government can remove tax exemptions from Churches. I never meant to imply they could not or should not. It is a decision that would have serious consequences.Besides, Black Churches are basically part of the Democratic Party so this won't happen anytime soon.</comment>

<comment>O! True colors!</comment>

<comment>The true color of pragmatism?</comment>

<comment>Why should the religious not pay for their own personal convictions?  It is quite an astonishing display of unearned entitled to insist that the taxpayers must do so because you will scream about being persecuted otherwise</comment>

<comment>So, a law repealing the tax-exempt status of the National Football League would violate the Constitution?</comment>

<comment>The NFL is a business, but you could make the argument it's a religion for some folks.</comment>

<comment>But the Constitution does not actually say that all religious institutions must be tax-exempt, does it?  An activist judge ruled that church buildings have to be in the nineteenth century, but by Antonin Scalia’s stated principles, that’s very hard to justify.  It’s led to absurdities like atheist organizations suing the IRS to get the same tax breaks for their leaders as “ministers of the gospel,” resulting in an ruling by the IRS that the corporate officers of atheist organizations are officially “ministers of the gospel.”  And the IRS gets very skeptical when a corporation claims to be a tax-exempt institution while charging money for goods and services.One question I would ask is: does this apply to religious beliefs that you, personally, disagree with?  Back in the ’60s, segregationists did try to claim the religious liberty to discriminate against black people.  So could a private school run by them be legally segregated just by calling itself “religious?”  Could one of them refuse, on religious grounds, to rent a hotel room to an interracial couple?  Could a hospital run by a segregated church refuse to let the black husband of one of its white patients visit her in the hospital or talk to her doctors, because it doesn’t recognize their marriage?Can any employer, or even just any religious employer, claim the religious liberty to hire Mexicans without green cards, citing Leviticus 19:34: “The foreigner residing among you must be treated as your native-born. Love them as yourself, for you were foreigners in Egypt”?  I have never heard any defender of “religious liberty” answer yes.  But why wouldn’t that count?  A claim that the government can pass a law you like because that’s a legitimate function of government, but not laws you don’t like because they restrict liberty, is a mere tautology.</comment>

<comment>Non-profits aren't automatically entitled to tax exemptions, which is why the IRS reviews their applications.</comment>

<comment>The more effective extortion is the relentless threat of hellfire and damnation.</comment>

<comment>Extortion, like the threat of excommunication.</comment>

<comment>ReallyClaiming that all tax payers must support your personal club house is quite an unearned privilege. forcing others to pay for your religion is not exactly what you would call a lack of religious freedom for YOU</comment>

<comment>False. The base case is being taxed, and then these organizations were granted an exemption. That's what an exemption means. Taking away for policy reasons something which was granted for policy reasons is hardly extortion.Not only that, but extortion implies a demand for something in exchange for something else (e.g., give me money, or I'll publish these embarrassing pictures of you). What's the ask here, in your scenario?</comment>

<comment>If religion cannot survive in the marketplace of ideas without government support then that would mean that that religion becomes a subsidiary of the government. Is our government in the business of religion? As an atheist, could I ask for a tax credit to offset my support for your religion? Why are you taking away my freedom by forcing me to pay for your religion? Isn't that a form of tyranny as it relates to non-believers?</comment>

<comment>I prefer the custom in German speaking countries where Christians pay a special tax which is then remitted to the Church.</comment>

<comment>Now you're just trolling.No one should be forced to pay for the operation of a religious service. And it's entirely unconstitutional here in the United States where we have a separation of church and state.Nice try.</comment>

<comment>Church membership is not compulsory in German speaking countries. </comment>

<comment>Good. It shouldn't be compulsory anywhere, even if an Arizona legislator wanted to pass such a law recently. (She withdrew it in the face of outrage.)</comment>

<comment>When the government gives a tax break to a church, that's called a tax expenditure. They do not pay their fair share of taxes and they are borne by all of us. Therefore, you are subsidizing religious belief.</comment>

<comment>It seems that Hobby Lobby opened the door to all of us picking and choosing what we want to pay for based on our religious beliefs. That will be part of Scalia's legacy and it is ugly. My religious belief is that there are no gods, wizards or ghosts so why am I being forced to pay for someone's church? If Christians can refuse to pay for contraception, then why do I have to pay for a Mormon's magical underwear? Why should I pay for a priest's wine or junkets to Jerusalem? Your idea of the Christians creating their own tax fund makes perfect sense but we still have to get the 3 other medieval-minded justices off of the court. Vote Sanders. If he doesn't get the nomination, vote Clinton. Democrats need to stay united so we can fix the mess that Scalia, Alito, Thomas and Roberts have created.</comment>

<comment>The Kirchensteuer (Christian Tax) is a medieval custom. Democrats would never allow government to become tithe collectors.</comment>

<comment>I suppose that it's all in the words then. Let's call it the Christian Sustenance Fund. The point is, if the Christians can make the case that they shouldn't pay for a woman's contraception based on their belief then why should I pay for your religion? It makes no sense to me.Fundamentalist christians, who flock to the Republican Party as a block, are more supportive of fealty to religious connections to our government. Most would prefer that we become a christian caliphate if only they could have the political structures in place to do so. That was where the likes of Scalia would have taken us if they could control all the levers of power. Appointing more conservative justices will yield prayer in schools and a complete ban on abortion and contraception. Don't forget that the precursor to Roe v Wade was Griswold v. Connecticut. The case was essentially about a town that had banned ALL contraception. It may seem unlikely but that actually happened in our country not so long ago. We have evidence of their intent. That is what conservatives really mean when they say they want to return the nation to traditional American values.</comment>

<comment>I, myself, wondered what could be fuelling such backward beliefs. What year is it, anyway, 1016? The overzealous religious right seem to be living in some alternate reality/time, where they feel that a continued denial of reality will eventually force us all to accept their backward beliefs.One of the most interesting takes I've read about the fundamentalist phenomena is Robert Minor's (Professor Emeritus of Religious Studies at the University of Kansas) WHEN RELIGION IS AN ADDICTION:"An eye-opening and hard-hitting work, "When Religion Is an Addiction" not only puts the political activities of the right-wing in a new perspective, but explains how liberal responses have often enabled religious addiction to thrive. Dr. Minor applies contemporary understandings of addictions to the extreme Christian right-wing in the United States and concludes that for them religion is functioning as a process addiction. Crucial to the addictiveness of such religion is its obsession with human depravity, the ultimate expression of low self-worth. The emotional "high" of righteousness functions to eliminate the addicts' sense of personal responsibility for their teachings, their actions, and their actions' painful toll on other human beings. Religious addiction, he observes, often covers sexual addictions. And the current right-wing obsession with political campaigns and victories is the even stronger fix the addiction demands to cover growing fears of failure. Too often the responses of liberals have been like those of enablers in an addict's family who through their reactions prevent the addict from hitting bottom. Arguing about religion, for example, only promotes the addiction. In the final chapter Dr. Minor reveals a non-enabling way to respond to those people for whom religion functions as an addiction."http://www.posthypnoticpress.c...Use this coupon, get 25% off on downloads and CDs: "Religion".</comment>

<comment>For most, the argument against gay marriage, as explained by a Mormon friend, has nothing to do with condemning them or trying to stop them from being gay.  It's that the law is forcing churches to treat homo unions the same as hetero ones, which their interpretation of their holiest book says is wrong.  The media are the ones setting up the strawman here.(I see nothing at all wrong with gay marriage myself, for the inevitable, wrong assumptions that will no doubt be generated toward me for presenting the other side.)</comment>

<comment>In what way is the 'law' "forcing churches to treat homo unions the same as hetero ones"?Civil law sets standards for civil behavior between all people within society. Without such standards, no society can long survive as a civil one.Civil law is not about setting personal moral standards for behavior; nor religious ones for that matter.  It is about defining and maintaining ethical standards for civil behavior towards each other.No Church is being 'forced' to marry anyone.  But, as a matter of civil law, they are not allowed to discriminate against any married persons because of their religious beliefs. They are not allowed to say 'We will provide these employment benefits, pensions, et cetera to 'these' people because ..." any more than bible-thumping white Supremacists  can discriminate against blacks because..."Civil law setting standards for civil behavior derives its authority from the political authority of the people altogether, not just of some of the people. The law of the land is not religiously sanctioned law in a pluralistic society.</comment>

<comment>Point missed, apparently.Churches hold marriage as a holy union.  To them, that union can only be between one man and one woman.  When churches are forced to recognize marriage as something else (like that cake shop that tried to refuse to make a cake for a gay couple and were successfully sued), it is, in their eyes, and infringement on their beliefs.They're perfectly fine with it being a union, a bond, or anything else you want to call it.  Everyone can and should have the same legal rights.  However, forcing them to recognize it as being exactly the same as one of their most sacred beliefs is what they find offensive.  You're being just as close-minded by smugly telling them you're right without taking the time to even learn why they feel the way they do.And for crying out loud, quit comparing it to racial segregation.  It's not even in the same ballpark.</comment>

<comment>It is you who is looking at the world with a blindfold on, imagining what is there to be seen rather than seeing what is there to be seen.Marriage is a civil union in civil law.Marriage is a sacred union in religious terms. Call it sacramental, or covenantial, or simply blessed if you wish -- Christians and others do disagree about that.One does not preclude the other.Recognizing one form of marriage in law does not preclude recognizing the other form of marriage as religiously meaningful for those who have such beliefs  (as I do).  The law only requires that those who are married before and under the law are not discriminated against on the basis of religious beliefs about what the civil law SHOULD BE.The civil law requires only that marriage as a civil union is recognized as such. And, it adds that this union is to be recognized by everyone.This does not prevent you from believing one form of union is more sacred than another. It does prevent you from discriminating on the basis of your idea of what is or is not a proper marriage.Miscegenistic beliefs, mostly religious in origin, once prohibited 'interbreeding' and refused to recognize such 'marriages' as such.And you think this issue has little in common with racial segregation and the discrimination that existed in the past.The pattern holds, and you know that, blindfold or not.</comment>

<comment>The institution that came up with the language of "intrinsically disordered" is the same institution that did almost nothing to actually stop a wave of sexual predators that they employed from assaulting the innocent among them. "Intrinsically disordered" indeed!</comment>

<comment>The Catholic Church, the largest organized pedophile ring in history, should have been shuttered years ago.Wearing dresses and talking to the air do not excuse their violence.</comment>

<comment>There's a fascinating book about this by three priests: "Sex, Priests, and Secret Codes: The Catholic Church's 2000-year Paper Trail of Sexual Abuse," by Thomas P. Doyle , A.W. Richard Sipe, Patrick J. Wall. It should be required reading for all Catholics."The Doyle-Sipe-Wall report clearly demonstrates a deep-seated problem that spans the Church's history. This collection of documents from official and unofficial sources begins its survey in 60 CE and concludes with the contemporary scandal. It reveals an institution that has tried to come to grips with this devastating internal problem from its earliest years. At times circumspect and at other times open and direct, Church leaders tried a variety of means to rein in the various violations of clerical celibacy. The sexual abuse crisis is not isolated from the questions of the celibate practice of all Catholic clergy and the moral questions that involve marriage and all human sexual behaviors. These are the main, yet unspoken, reasons why sexual abuse has been such an inflammatory and dangerous issue for the hierarchy. The Church abuse scandal of the contemporary era, rather than seen as a new challenge, is actually the catalyst for a complex process that is forcing the official Church to redefine its ideology of sexuality, its responsibility to its members and its role in society. The three distinguished authors have served as experts and consultants in over 1,000 cases of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy, and have collectively spent over 70 years of official service within the church."https://books.google.com/books...</comment>

<comment>Thank you for this important reference.</comment>

<comment>When I point out that the majority of the sexual violence in the Church comes from 'intrinsically disordered' priests, I get banned from Catholic sites.Those 'intrinsically disordered' priests need to be removed from the Church. Not that I expect Pope 'Who Am I To Judge' to have the cojones to do that.</comment>

<comment>Homosexuality is in no way the same as pedophilia no matter how often you repeat that tired old canard.Homosexuality entails two consenting same sex adults having sex, no violence or rape involvedPedophilia is an adult and a child having sex (either of the same or opposite sex, yes priests also raped female children), this is always rape and all rape is violence</comment>

<comment>@ mr Mr j.  The bit about forcing churches to marry gays is a big fat obvious straw man.</comment>

<comment>Women aren't intrinsically disordered--in your opinion. There are websites full of people who will disagree with you; check out the MRA movement some time.Which is why we need the distinction between private religion and public government--so opinions don't become encoded into law and policy.</comment>

<comment>The two are inseparable.</comment>

<comment>That is their agenda.</comment>

<comment>Of course it is. And they are well within their rights to do it. It's already the case in many parts of Europe that public expressions of faith are outlawed. </comment>

<comment>And where would that be? Please, where in Europe is it illegal to express your faith?OOopps, I forgot, you just pulled that out of your butt so it must be true.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps Courageousmisterj refers to law in France banning the wearing of face-covering head scarves.</comment>

<comment>It also prohibits Christians from displaying large crucifixes on their person while employed in public service, though that is not always as vigorously enforced as the headscarf ban.The language that separates Church and State in France is very similar to the language of our First Amendment. It's the interpretation and enforcement that makes the difference. America could easily adopt French laïcité with a few new Supreme Court appointees.</comment>

<comment>Really?!I have traveled plenty through France (usually on my way to Barcelona or Lisbon)  they must have temporarily revoked that ban specially for me when i was there!Are you talking about Flavor Flav sized crucifixes?  Yeah there really is no ban against that, it is simply a matter of having a better fashion sense.</comment>

<comment>Baloney.  Liberals will fight for your right to believe what you choose, worship as you chose, with, or without whoever you chose.  We even give your church freedom from taxes.

<comment>Being gay is not a problem when it comes to employment in a Catholic entity. The Church does not teach that being gay is sinful. The employment problem arises when Catholic employees, most, if not all, of whom have signed contracts including clauses about upholding the Church's teachings, live in ways that directly oppose Church teaching -- female teachers who have abortions and gay people who live in gay relationships.</comment>

<comment>christians don't want religious liberty they want christian favoritism. they have shown they only want christian prayers in govt, only christian monuments at court houses, only christian prayer in schools.</comment>

<comment>Religious liberty died when Antonin Scalia wrote the majority opinion in the 1990 Supreme Court case, Oregon Employment Division v. Smith.  He was the author of the broad-brushed undermining of individual religious liberty that made necessary the Religious Freedom Restoration Act."Religious liberty" only became a suspicious argument for us when people on the Right started trying to claim it as an immunity that would allow people in positions of power (political or private sector) to impose or inflict their religious views on people under their jurisdiction or employment.True religious liberty, for instance, does not grant county clerk Kim Davis the immunity to disregard the law and impose her beliefs on couples seeking marriage licenses in Rowan County, Kentucky.</comment>

<comment>Scalia was such a nice man in person, but bitterly acidic and not at all Christian in his writing.  I don't see how anyone can say that the Church isn't better off without him.  He was about as Christian as Trump.</comment>

<comment>When you are dealing with extremism and highly dangerous and even treasonous people sometimes you need "bitterly acidic" responses.Jesus knocked over tables at the temple and brandished a whip. Scalia was right to harness the same kind of energy.</comment>

<comment>Aha! Manichean thinking</comment>

<comment>Being at times "bitterly acidic" is in-line with the first amendment right to free speech; it is not the dualistic opposite of trying to undermine such a right, or other Constitutional principles.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I know what you mean. The Christians are definitely extremist and highly dangerous.</comment>

<comment>"Religious Liberty"? A better question is what does his death mean for the Constitution? If we get any more Justices that treat the document as "living" and up to their subjective coaxing, the document ceases to have any valid meaning.It was not Roman Catholicism lurking behind his legal opinions on abortion or marriage deconstruction, it is the actual meaning of the Constitution (and what it includes) lurking there.When a Justice is not making up extra-constitutional stuff that does not mean he is avoiding doing this because of religious reasons; it could just be that the Constitution is not an infinite document. </comment>

<comment>The Constitution as Holy Writ. Great.</comment>

<comment>No. The Constitution as a guide which includes rules to make changes thereto...  Liberals have just gotten lazy about actually changing the rules in the manner provided.</comment>

<comment>That's a valid point, but don't pretend the conservatives haven't done the exact same thing.</comment>

<comment>The Conservatives on the Court? Sure, they may have, but they are promoting 'originalism.' Where the Liberals on the Court are promoting the 'living' Constitution view. Blame the Conservatives for being hypocritical and following too much of the Liberal view at times, not for promoting the better view.</comment>

<comment>No. Learn some context. I mean conservatives in the legislature and the oval office.</comment>

<comment>Well, the liberals on the Court who are lazy about changing the rules in the manner provided are also dangerous.</comment>

<comment>They have undoubtedly tried to game the system via the legislative process but they haven't been trying to have the panel of nine justices use the "evolving document" position to remove rights in the way that liberals have used it to create new rights which are not included in the Constitution (including all amendments).</comment>

<comment>I don’t think you could find three Democrats who’d agree that Citizens United and Hobby Lobby did not do exactly that.  And, yes, once the rules changed, both sides played by them.</comment>

<comment>I see, laws are passed, etc, and "liberals are lazy".</comment>

<comment>No. My point is more that liberals just want a panel of nine to "interpret" new rights into the Constitution since building the support to put them there through the Amendment process (the right way to do it) is difficult by design.  That said, I understand why this has been their strategy having watched the ERA wither on the vine the last time tried to do it the right way.</comment>

<comment>That isn't laziness, it is doing what works. However, it does lead to sfort-termism</comment>

<comment>Well, restricting voting rights using Constitutionally-allowable means works as well but I can't find many dems or independents who would agree that that is an appropriate way of "working within the system."</comment>

<comment>I don't see many liberals lazily trying to limit voting rights....so I think we have wandered off topic here</comment>

<comment>The Constitution as Writ.</comment>

<comment>Why do you worship this document which is over 240 years old, has been amended to make it more in tune with then current political reality, and will be amended in the future? The basic rights enumerated in the Constitution are all fine as they stand, but wherever the Constitution is used to deny human dignity by retrograde "originalists" it is used to corrupt the intent of the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>I don't worship the document. I think that when people write something, especially when it is formal and legal we should read what was written and intended and not put our own subjective imagination as a politically expedient gatekeeper, so we can make it mean whatever is most convenient for our goals. That throws off everyone else who doesn't have access to an individual's subjective whims. Everyone has access to the text as it is written. That is how civil society has to use it. If it is treated as "living" it could grow in any direction and multiple contradictory directions at the same time and that reaches absurdity and results in power plays and might makes right. A Constitutional Republic is meant to prevent such doors to tyranny.There are many subjective and contradictory views on what "human dignity" means. One's imagining the Constitution provides dignity in a certain way is another's imagining it as denying dignity in a certain way. We have to go by what the text actually says and means, and if we don't like it, amend it through the amendment process.</comment>

<comment>OK then. Holy Writ.</comment>

<comment>If the Constitution becomes a dead letter, as liberals wish, then we live in a dictatorship. That what you want?</comment>

<comment>Ho ho ho. Either/or.  My choice a or b. Really? False dichotomy</comment>

<comment>"If we get any more Justices that treat the document as "living" and up to their subjective coaxing, the document ceases to have any valid meaning.""it is the actual meaning of the Constitution (and what it includes) lurking there."One person's 'subjective coaxing' is another person's 'actual meaning' and vice versa.</comment>

<comment>That is a self-defeating idea that leads to absurdity.There are certain views of meaning that are more in-line with the actual meaning, there are others that are less. Any view that rejects this could itself be interpreted as less in line with meaning by anyone willing to do so and the view would justify this approach. It commits suicide.</comment>

<comment>"There are certain views of meaning that are more in-line with the actual meaning, there are others that are less."Mintap, for the first 60 years of its life, freedom of speech in the constitution was freedom of speech as intended: Either handwritten documents or the words coming out of your mouth.Then came the telegraph: A form of speech that involved neither writing nor talking. Back then it would have been very easy for an 'originalist' to claim that since the telegraph did not involve speaking or writing, it was not free 'speech', and therefore not protected by 1A.Fortunately for us, this either failed, or did not happen</comment>

<comment>That is just an example of bad interpretation. Handwriting was never literal "speech." There is no articulation of sounds to make it "speech." The surrounding context of "speech" in the 1A is the free exercise of religion and of press. These are clearly broad enough to include the telegraph or internet.</comment>

<comment>If the constitution were meant to be static then why did it include a process for amending it? The founders clearly knew that our society and/or values would change over time. Its just absurd to me the way that some people defer to the founders for everything. As if they thought of every possible contingency. Every way in which our society could change. The Constitution is an amazing document, but its not a perfect document, and it never will be.</comment>

<comment>They did include a process for amending it, but that process does not include judicial *reinterpretation* of existing Constitutional protections in order to find new ones, or to eliminate existing ones.</comment>

<comment>Amending is not the same or changing or ignoring the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Amending the Constitution *literally means the same thing* as changing it.</comment>

<comment>No, it means adding onto. Amendments can change things.</comment>

<comment>Did I accidentally wander into some Kafka story?Me: "Amending means making changes."You: "No, it doesn't mean that. Also, amendments can change things.".........Constitutional Amendments can add sections to the Constitution or repeal them. Both additions and subtractions are changes.Merriam-Webster definition of 'amend' (emphasis added by me):1. to change some of the words and often the meaning of (a law, document, etc.)2. to change and improve (something, such as a mistake or bad situation)</comment>

<comment>What does "reinterpretation" mean? You might as well just abolish the supreme court if that's the case. In order for there to be a reinterpretation, someone- a person with subjective points of view- had to interpret it in the first place. There is no objective interpretation to the constitution. How do you know that earlier justices didn't get it wrong, and the "reinterpretation" isn't just the current court getting it right? That's the stance that literally every SC decision has. No one says, "I am pulling this new constitutional principal wholesale out of my butt". They say, "after reviewing the constitution, we have now found that it says x, y, and z." That's a deconstruction of literally every SC decision, because that's the only way that a Supreme Court can work.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough. 'Reinterpretation' isn't quite the right word. I think that Scalia's textualism (the statue means what it says, not what someone thinks it might mean) and originalism (the Constitution means what it meant when it was adopted, not necesarilly what people might want it to mean today) is helpful here, at least as a lay-person who likes to think that he can understand at least a portion of the law under which he lives, without keeping up with the day to day minutia of smaller legal decisions.I mean, to some extent I *do* enjoy keeping up with that day-to-day minutia, but I don't think one should *have* to do so to be able to understand how a law is implemented.</comment>

<comment>I think part of the problem is that Scalia had so many principles, he could always find some principle to justify whatever conclusion he wanted to reach.  I’m pretty sure that happened subconsciously.  But, for example, when the Obama administration found laws from the 1790s where the Founders passed mandates for all (white, male) citizens to buy goods from private companies, and even one that mandated people buy insurance, that didn’t change his opinion on the Affordable Care Act.</comment>

<comment>The constitution was NOT meant to be static.And the key word there is "meant," i.e., the Constitution actually has a meaning. It is not living, with it's meaning blowing in the wind.The original meaning of the document is that we use amendments as things change. We DO NOT use judicial word deconstruction jujitsu whenever progressives want special change that they cannot get through the amendment process. </comment>

<comment>Dude, no. You're confusing the actual functions in the document itself, with how the founders envisioned people would interact with it.</comment>

<comment>Whose interpretation of how the founders envisioned people would interact with it?Theirs or yours?</comment>

<comment>Just because the meaning of something changes over time doesn't mean it doesn't have a meaning. The founders meant the content of the document to be subject to interpretation. Why else would it be so vague in places? What is "cruel and unusual punishment" for example? They left it up to us to decide. That's what doesn't change. We get to decide what the constitution means, because that's how self governance works. We decide what laws we follow. Not some guys who died 200 years ago.</comment>

<comment>I feel sorry for your high school teachers.  Did you drive them all crazy?</comment>

<comment>Whether or not they were driven crazy is left up to him to decide.</comment>

<comment>So you do think some intention doesn't change, but at the same time we get to decide what changes? What if we decide that the parts that you think don't change do change? We if we change the rule that everything can change and make it that the intention matters? Or is that amount of change off limits, so there is something that cannot change? You just only want what you want to not change to be static?There is a moral element to interpretation. Deciding what is "cruel" is a moral question.John Adams said that, "Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."It takes a certain moral and religious view to respect the actual meaning of a text, and also to interpret it well when left open for interpretation. In contrast it is immoral to deconstruct it beyond the actual meaning.</comment>

<comment>Ah, yes, the Amish Constitution.It doesn't mention zippers. Guess we ought to get rid of those. Oh, and don't you have to belong to an organized militia to be exempt from gun control?Tell me again how that doesn't count, you miserable, far right shites.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. Scalia paid close attention to the militia aspect of the second amendment.Oh wait. He didn't. He treated it like inconvenient toilet paper.</comment>

<comment>Yes, we should adhere to the strict meaning of those 18th century perfectionists. I say bring bring back slavery because how could that have been wrong? That woman voting thingy was probably right as well. While we're at it, you know that we created a completely new constitution just a few years after the first one, don't you? We should wipe out this constitution and go back to the Articles of Confederation to be real he-men originalists. Aw, scrap that and just let the pope be our king as they did in the real good-old-days.</comment>

<comment>You are giving examples of Judicial activism and progressive extra-constitutional policies. If we'd stick to the Constitution and stick to the amendment process and reduce the amount of tyrannical tricky business we don't have slavery or devaluing of women.</comment>

<comment>What I'm really saying is that the founders were advocates of vigorous changes in our constitution and governing philosophies as evidenced by the first 25 years of our independence. They completely scrapped the Articles of Confederation, faced massive disagreements as to whether the constitution even needed a bill of rights, and proposed 20 amendments to it, of which 12 were passed, within 15 years of the ratification of the original constitution. We have only passed 15 amendments in the 210 years which followed. The founders were clearly for adjustments and wholesale change to our governing structures yet we are so timid and restrained by adherence to what many conservatives see as an inerrant document.</comment>

<comment>It makes sense that there will be many more amendments as things are getting going and that as time passes more time-tested principles will remain and fewer amendments are needed.What is the alternative? Illegal or under-the-table deals? Progressives don't like the Constitution because adhering to it doesn't let them cheat. Conservatives like the Constitution because adhering to it doesn't let the Progressives cheat.Progressivism's continual need to cheat is evidence that it has more errors as an ideology than Conservatism does. Sure, Conservatism has some errors, but conserving checks and balances helps compensate for these. Progressives have no self-reining-in, that is why Conservatives must also conserve the 2nd amendment.</comment>

<comment>Basically he was saying that if you want to change the law then do it through legislation.  Don't rely on the courts to do it.  Because that's a judicial Caliphate.  And he was saying, that's how the founding fathers intended it.  I can respect that.  Unfortunately few of the current presidential candidates seem to understand that.</comment>

<comment>Unless you want to change the law through to expand healthcare. In that case the legislature can go to heck.</comment>

<comment>The role of the Supreme Court is to invalidate laws if they are unconstitutional.  Like requiring people do things that go against their religion - this is a violation of free expression.  But they should not just create law out of whole cloth.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Like they did with the Affordable Care Act.</comment>

<comment>Actually that was Roberts building up credibility for when he rescinds Roe v Wade.</comment>

<comment>Please. For once, Just stop with the babble.</comment>

<comment>Will I be the first resident of the gulag?  Do I get to choose my room?</comment>

<comment>You can share one with me. We'll be roommates. After Goodwin Liu sentences us there.</comment>

<comment>Where does it say in the Constitution that the role of the Supreme court is to invalidate laws that are unconstitutional? My copy of the Constitution says no such thing, does yours? If Scalia was such a literal Constitutionalist, where did he find in it the power to invalidate laws?</comment>

<comment>In all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party, the supreme Court shall have original Jurisdiction. In all the other Cases before mentioned, the supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact, with such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make.Appellate jurisdiction both as to Law Fact.  Right there.</comment>

<comment>Marbury v. MadisonJust because Scalia was an Originalist, that doesn't mean he ignored precedent.</comment>

<comment>I wish more courts had his views.</comment>

<comment>If he's really deferring to the founding fathers though, then he's forgetting about all of the UNDEMOCRATIC parts of the Constitution. The founders never intended to set up governance by a plebiscite. If you read their writings about the thought process that went into the constitution, there is a serious concern about tyranny by the majority. Hence, protections against that, like the Bill of Rights.</comment>

<comment>Exactly - the minority fights for their rights until they get a majority to vote for it.  Then if the new law violates the Bill of Rights, the SC will invalidate it.  That's exactly how it's supposed to work, so thanks for reiterating that.  The founding fathers really were complete geniuses.  At this point though I don't know if they are laughing or crying.</comment>

<comment>No, that's not really how its supposed to work. Fundamental rights are not subject to a vote. That's why they're fundamental rights. You don't have to ask the majority to give you back something that they never had the right to take from you in the first place. I mean, would you agree that rather than the SC desegregating schools, we should have just waited for the southern state legislatures to do it on their own?</comment>

<comment>Like I said, the genius of the Constitution is that if you believe you have a right to something, then you can fight for it without being prosecuted.  Then you fight and then you win.  And no need for a judicial caliphate.  It's pretty cool when you think about it.</comment>

<comment>...Unless the legislature makes it a crime to fight for a particular cause that you believe in. Then you can be prosecuted, and in your world the courts would not be able to do anything about it. Because that is a judicial caliphate. Whatever the hell that is.</comment>

<comment>"Unless the legislature makes it a crime to fight for a particular cause that you believe in."  But that is unconstitutional from the first amendment.  That's the role of the SC.  Do you get it now?</comment>

<comment>But you just said that it is up to the people to fight for what they believe in and convince the majority to vote for it- not to have the SC overruling legislation. Which is it?</comment>

<comment>LOL as Scalia would say, this is intellectual gobbledy-gook.  You fight for your rights and you win them.  If your right is to make it a crime to prevent others from fighting for their rights peacefully then the SC invalidates it.  Get it?  It's really not that hard.  Here's an example: People vote for Trump, who institutes a registry for Muslims.  Then the SC says it violates free expression and invalidates it.  Its genius is its simplicity.</comment>

<comment>Then you have your 2nd amendment right which remains no matter what the legislature or court says about it.</comment>

<comment>Get another liberal on the Supreme Court, and they will make the 2nd amendment a dead letter.</comment>

<comment>But The Bill of Rights was voted on, as were all the succeeding Constitutional amendments. So your " Fundamental rights are not subject to a vote" line is nothing but liberal clap-trap, designed to legitimize the rulings of activist judges who impose minority views on the whole country -- views they know perfectly well could never get through a legislature.</comment>

<comment>Scalia was a pretty doctrinaire conservative Catholic on the bench. Like a lot of right wing Catholics he was peeved at the Churches liberal turn post Vatican II, and in the other cases he was quick to vote against exemptions for non-Christian practices but for protections of Christian interests. Funny thing about Scalia's textualism: somehow the text always agreed with him!</comment>

<comment>Did it agree with him in his decision in Texas v Johnson?</comment>

<comment>Not just a Catholic but a Latin Mass Catholic.</comment>

<comment>"“The mere possession of religious convictions which contradict the relevant concerns of a political society does not relieve the citizen from the discharge of political responsibilities,” he [Scalia] added.I don't think Scalia's position in Hobby Lobby was at all consistent with that quote.</comment>

<comment>Because Hobby Lobby came after The RFRA...</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure I agree.  In the first case, he was referring to plaintiffs who broke a law and wanted relief from the penalties whereas, in the Hobby Lobby, the plaintiffs were seeking relief from doing something which implicitly went against their belief system...I think a better corollary on the first case would have been if the law had required the plaintiffs to excavate their ancestors bones (or do something else that they considered abhorent)...  Really, the limitation on their ability to smoke peyote (prior to the law changing) has more similarity to the currently outlawed nature of several aspects of the religion known as SantaRia (where you are told you can't do something you want to) than the Hobby Lobby decision, where the law compelled people to do something they found objectionable...</comment>

<comment>You have given me food for thought.Thank you.</comment>

<comment>A corporation cannot have a belief system, the shareholders and directors are not synonymous with the corporation, that's one of the many reasons Hobby Lobby is such a garbage decision</comment>

<comment>I think that distinction falls down when the thing they find objectionable involves the phrase, “forced to allow.”</comment>

<comment>The road to hell is paved with good intentions.  That's the thing he understood.  It's another way of conceptualizing the devil, and the importance of religion for reminding us of that, even as we must be careful not to impose that belief on others.  I think this is what made him come off as a crank.  He knew you couldn't just give everybody everything they wanted and this would make everyone happy.  No, it would lead inevitably to hell.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps an activist court was required for a while in the 1960's to establish civil rights, as a completion of the win from the Civil War 80 years earlier.  However it hasn't been required since, and Scalia steered it back on course to its original purpose - invalidating unconstitutional laws.  The genius of the Constitution is that the Bill of Rights grants us free speech to argue for our rights via legislation.  So that we don't need a Supreme Caliphate to make these decisions for us.  Unfortunately I fear the country is swinging back in the other direction - towards an activist court and even the 'Republicans' will go along with it.</comment>

<comment>Scalia steered it back too far ... to the stone-age.</comment>

<comment>Again, I ask, where in the Constitution do you find that the Supreme Court has the power to invalidate laws? Which article?</comment>

<comment>It's called 'judicial review'.  Look it up.  Also 'Marbury vs Madison'.</comment>

<comment>Its been true ever since Marbury vs Madison ... there's been ample time for one side or the other to explicitly reject that power for the USSC by drafting an Amendment but no one has ever, ever taken the opportunity to do so.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately, the lesson liberals learned from the Civil Rights movement was that they had got this nifty new bag of tools that would let them bypass the hard work of getting majority approval, passing laws, or passing Constitutional amendments -- forever, for any new cause they decided to take up. And liberals packed the courts with judges who saw it their way.</comment>

<comment>Genius.Intellectual Giant.God among men.That was Antonin Scalia.RIP.Props to one of the site's well known liberals for growing a conscience on the message boards. Proud of you.</comment>

<comment>He was a complete moronic hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>I'm okay with you being wrong.</comment>

<comment>Well then be prepared to be disappointed.</comment>

<comment>You're an Atheist? Congratulations. So am I.Scalia did nothing to infringe upon either of our non-belief.</comment>

<comment>He definitely tried to.</comment>

<comment>You're welcome to prove it.</comment>

<comment>His vote in the Hobby Lobby Case is proof enough.</comment>

<comment>Hobby Lobby decided they should not be forced to provide specific kinds of birth control.They provide others.Why is it that you think that their choice to not provide some birth control while they provided others is "religion ruling your life"? Do you have the need for birth control?</comment>

<comment>I have the need for religious beliefs to NOT dictate court rulings or law making.</comment>

<comment>And they haven't dictated them. You're creating a straw man, again and again.</comment>

<comment>Any ruling in favor of "religious liberty" tramples on atheist rights. Regardless of the subject.</comment>

<comment>If you're looking for sympathy, look elsewhere.A ruling in favor of Hobby Lobby provided a chance, for once, for Christians to not be persecuted in the USA.Please be a concern troll elsewhere.</comment>

<comment>Christians are the PERSECUTORS not the Persecuted.I'm a Republican btw.</comment>

<comment>Oh my friend... We don't have time to go into how bad some Christians are. I'm aware of that fact. Christians are persecuted in this country and around the world.There is no denying that. (This is where you bring up Westboro Baptist, like it's a shining example of Christian Faith)</comment>

<comment>No this is where I bring up the Roman Catholic Church and the entire Southern Baptist Faith and the Mormons and all the evil sick, demented corrupt evangelicals out there that hijack our national debate with their primitive anti-science superstitions.Moderate Religionists aid and abet the radical fringe just by continuing to accept the lie that there is a supernatural existence.</comment>

<comment>The Roman Catholic Church? As a religious institution, it is fine. Southern Baptists as a religious entity are fine.Mormons? Same thing.</comment>

<comment>That just demonstrates your lack of proper perspective.</comment>

<comment>Enlighten me then.</comment>

<comment>As an atheist I think Religions shouldn't have liberty to dictate my life.</comment>

<comment>Even when they align with universal human rights?</comment>

<comment>I reject religion's place in "human rights" in the first place.</comment>

<comment>So far as to throw the baby out with the bathwater? If Christianity says that murder is wrong, and we can't have such religion influence human rights, should we not let such a principle have the liberty to dictate our life (including possible murderous impulses)?</comment>

<comment>If you need an imaginary guy in the sky telling you that murder is wrong, you have severe problems.</comment>

<comment>Those with the severe problems are the ones that cannot justify why they feel murder is wrong.</comment>

<comment>Some things are true just because they are true ... axioms don't require religion.</comment>

<comment>But they require more blind faith than religions need.</comment>

<comment>No they don't.</comment>

<comment>You take that sentence on blind faith don't you?</comment>

<comment>"above all, he believed it is a country that must be governed by close adherence to what he saw as the original intentions of the Founders," at least when it fit his own interpretational purposes. Scalia was quite able to abandon any kind of realistic following his Holy (Founding) Father's intentions when it didn't square with his late twentieth century conservative views of the how the world should be governed. Political analysts should stop giving Scalia and his ilk the benefit of the doubt that they're always (or even often) actually faithfully following their beloved principle of originalism.</comment>

<comment>"acidly conservative opinion"......wow.   Really?   Let me guess:  Emma Green would never write about Kagan's acidly liberal opinion.</comment>

<comment>liberal views are abhorrent by nature</comment>

<comment>Ok sweet... Thanks for  chiming in Terry.</comment>

<comment>Sorry for being long winded but a lot to unpack...The Republican Party is playing with political fire if they plan to obstruct an appointment to the Supreme Court. There are way too many political nails for the Democratic Party to pound. Pound not just for the sake of pounding but because there happens to be mountains of public polling evidence on issues that matter to Americans but unprecedented evidence of Republican obstruction within the Senate during the Obama administration.No Republican gets to define when an appointment can be made to the court other than the President. The GOP which cites the constitution, when convenient, has no constitutional basis to suggest the President cannot nominate. Guarantee you if Mr. GOP President would be in the position of President Obama they would claim they were elected for a specific term and are well within their mandate to nominate. Elections have consequences!The Supreme Court if America were to witness Senate GOP mulishness will have a vacant seat for greater than 1.5-2 years. American people at large will not tolerate such a situation.GOP senators seeking re-election, even election for the first time, in blue or purple states will be effortlessly labelled as obstructionists.There is a documented history of unprecedented obstruction from Senate Republicans since the start of the Obama administration with respect to administrative and judicial Presidential appointments. Highly doubt the majority of Americans are familiar with the facts and when exposed to the pattern of demonstrated purposeful obstruction in combination with the urgency to restore functionality to the court any type of continued obstruction will be reinforced as Republican intransigence.Democrats can point to a plethora of issues that Republicans are on the wrong side of with respect to majority public opinion to stimulate voter turnout, especially minority voting segments.  Public will have a strong desire to protect progress made to date and protect against future court challenges on issues that the majority of Americans support via public polling. This will provide opportunity for Democrats to leverage minority voting segments as well. These issues include….Removing dark money from politics – Citizen’s United.Environmental regulation/policyVoting rightsWomen’s rightsGay rights and gay marriageRace equality issues such as affirmative action or housing.Labor rightsImmigrationHealthcareYet another example demonstrating the GOP does not have facts on their side.</comment>

<comment>They don't have a choice. They have to oppose a nominee.</comment>

<comment>No they don't have to ... they are Representatives that have agency to determine that maybe the needs of the nation outweigh the needs of their narrow constituency.</comment>

<comment>You're not thinking this through.The Senate does not have a choice.They /have/ to oppose a nominee.</comment>

<comment>True. Until it becomes politically inexpedient to oppose a nominee. Sometime after the general election has begun for instance.</comment>

<comment>really ?SCHUMER blocked Bush nominationsPAYBACK TIMEhttp://dailycaller.com/2016/02...</comment>

<comment>If you’re saying that Schumer is a hypocrite, fine.  (Although he didn’t go as far in 2007 as McConnell has.)  But if you read past the headline, even in that polemical source, Schumer never blocked any Bush nominations.</comment>

<comment>The United states is NOT "fundamentally a Christian nation".  It is a religion neutral nation, that has a majority Christian population</comment>

<comment>Imagine if the US *acted* like a Christian nation.</comment>

<comment>Which (officially) Christian nation would you like the US to emulate?  How about El Salvador, where abortion is forbidden even in cases of rape or where the woman's life is in danger?Be careful what you imagine.  </comment>

<comment>I'd say our national policy pretty much leads to the opposite of most of the Sermom on the Mount. You may have missed his point.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. Gee, it would be fighting Muslims and trying to take back the Holy Lands for itself.Instead, it is fighting Muslims and trying to take back the Oily lands for itself.Plus la change ...</comment>

<comment>The US is fundamentally Christian.  We believe in peace and freedom and follow basic laws.  Of course, we are often tempted into evil, but such is life.  If we were a religiously neutral nation, like Germany or Russia, we would be susceptible to Nazism and Communism and other atheist conceits.  Or we could be like French, whose laicite - secular caliphate - will surely be their undoing.</comment>

<comment>You're the biggest idiot I have ever seen. You have to be trolling.</comment>

<comment>I'd also point out that central to the growth of all these destructive ideologies is the bullying and insults.  Thanks for the demonstration of how that works, please continue, perhaps try 'infidel' as your next angle of attack:</comment>

<comment>Instead, you are subject to the conceits of plutocrats who call themselves capitalists.Actually, they are opportunists.</comment>

<comment>The "takers"</comment>

<comment>We make, they take. And it is their view that they can take whatever they want to without complaint.</comment>

<comment>"religiously neutral nation, like Germany"i have to remember to not eat when reading something of such magnificent stupidity.  poor computer screen.</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>Troll or idiot?"...peace and freedom and follow basic laws" is not Christian.The Sermon on the Mount provides a reasonable summary of what it should mean to be a Christian.  Based on that I'd say that the US is the exact opposite in philosophy to Christianity. "It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God."American exceptionalism is never more ridiculous than when it invokes "Judeo-Christian values," which attempt to co-opt ethical values that predate Christianity, and in any case, Christians fail to follow with predictable regularity.Do you really think the Jews were surprised to hear that lying, stealing and murder were wrong when Moses came down from the mountain, or is it more likely that those norms predated the Jewish faith by thousands of years?</comment>

<comment>The U.S. has always been a Christian nation.</comment>

<comment>No, it isn't. This isn't debatable. It's so true and uncontroversial it's basically pedestrian knowledge.</comment>

<comment>Why is Christmas a federal holiday?</comment>

<comment>Huh? The fact you think that even means something is very telling.</comment>

<comment>Look at the list of federal holidays. They speak to important values we have as a nation:New Year’s DayBirthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.Washington’s BirthdayMemorial DayIndependence DayLabor DayColumbus DayVeterans DayThanksgiving DayChristmas DayOne value is our Christian heritage.Also why is Sunday (the Christian Sabbath) separated as a day of rest in the Constitution?</comment>

<comment>New Year’s Day-pagan holidayBirthday of Martin Luther King, Jr.Washington’s Birthday-commemorating great AmericansMemorial Day-celebrating veteransIndependence Day-celebrating IndependenceLabor Day-celebrating organized laborColumbus Day-celebrating the 'discoverer' of America Veterans Day-celebrating veteransThanksgiving Day-I could argue that this is the Harvest festival, but I'll give you this one because of its Puritan rootsChristmas Day-the only true Christian 'Holy day' on your listAnd what happened to Easter?</comment>

<comment>Actually it is New Years Day of the Gregorian calendar, a Christian day, we don't use the Julian calendar, so not a Pagan day.Birthday of MLK is commemorating civil rights,Birthday of Washington is commemorating the first executive(not just great Americans, but the principles behind them)And Easter is always on a Sunday. It is already a day off.</comment>

<comment>Lots of people now work Sundays, including Easter Sunday. They must if they want to keep their jobs.A Christian nation? Thomas Jefferson disagreed.</comment>

<comment>"A Christian nation" could have multiple meanings. On some levels the U.S. is clearly a Christian nation. There are countless details of the formation pointing to this.Sure, on other levels compared to other countries with state churches, or official bishops or patriarchs,  the U.S. is not a "Christian nation" in the same way.  Denmark, Sweden, and Norway are Christian nations in a way the U.S. is not.Thomas Jefferson held Christianity highly enough to assure that government doesn't meddle with it. The U.S. does have a government that has anything to do with Christianity, but it is a Christian nation. The best kind of Christian nations keep government in it's limited place unable to hinder religious exercise (real life).</comment>

<comment>It's pagan.</comment>

<comment>Because Congress said so.  Like Dr. King's birthday and Columbus Day, among other holidays.</comment>

<comment>And Congress has no power to decide what kind of nation the U.S. is?</comment>

<comment>In regard to religion, that is exactly correct.</comment>

<comment>Not because of the Puritans. THEY forbade the celebration of Christmas.</comment>

<comment>The inspiration and basis of our founding documents and laws including the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution is the Bible and our Judeo Christian heritage.</comment>

<comment>Actually, most of the provisions in the Constitution have no basis in the Bible.</comment>

<comment>From the Mayflower Compact:"Having undertaken, for the Glory of God, and advancements of the Christian faith and honor of our King and Country, a voyage to plant the first colony in the Northern parts of Virginia, do by these presents, solemnly and mutually, in the presence of God, and one another, covenant and combine ourselves together into a civil body politic"</comment>

<comment>The Pilgrims weren't Americans, what with the USA not existing yet and all. That, and I really don't think you're trying to suggest we're a Puritan nation.</comment>

<comment>The purpose of advancement of the Christian faith is stated up front as a goal of the civil body politic.</comment>

<comment>And? They're still neither American nor relevant. You might as well cite the similar goals of the Knights Hospitaller or Teutonic Order for all it matters.</comment>

<comment>Was that document the foundation of our nation? No. The constitution is. Where does the constitution mention God or Christian faith?</comment>

<comment>That is the beginning of the civil body politic that is the U.S. The Constitution is not the founding document. It is the supreme law. These are different. The Declaration of Independence is the document declaring the founding.</comment>

<comment>Literally the worst attempt at proving America is a Xtian nation I've ever seen. The friggin Mayflower Compact? Lol.</comment>

<comment>That wasn’t even the first permanent English colony in what later became the United States!</comment>

<comment>That was the beginning of the civil body in this land that is now the U.S.There is a reason that is an important document in U.S. history.</comment>

<comment>Why is there a stone engraving of Moses carrying Ten Commandments on the U.S. Supreme Court building?</comment>

<comment>The same reason why Muhammad is on the wall.ETA:  "The South Wall Frieze includes figures of lawgivers from the ancient world and includes Menes, Hammurabi, Moses, Solomon, Lycurgus, Solon, Draco, Confucius, and Augustus. The North Wall Frieze shows lawgivers from the Middle Ages on and includes representations of Justinian, Muhammad, Charlemagne, John of England, Louis IX of France, Hugo Grotius, Sir William Blackstone, John Marshall, and Napoleon."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>The Founding of the U.S. and our laws is not based on a "Co-exist" bumper sticker but on Judeo-Christian values and principals.There are at least six depictions of Moses and-or the Ten Commandments at the Supreme Court building.  Not the Koran or Muhammad.   Not Buda.  Not Gaia. The Declaration of Independence declares that man is created in the Divine image, all men are equal, man is superior to the state, the state exists for man. The Constitution is based on Christian ideas such the rule of law, trial by jury of peers,  Creator endowed rights, not government granted.“The Bible is the rock upon which our republic rests.” - Andrew Jackson.</comment>

<comment>"Christian ideas such the rule of law, trial by jury of peers,""The modern jury evolved out of the ancient custom of many ancient Germanic tribes whereby a group of men of good character was used to investigate crimes and/or judge the accused. The same custom evolved into the vehmic court system in medieval Germany. In Anglo-Saxon England, juries investigated crimes. After the Norman Conquest, some parts of the country preserved juries as the means of investigating crimes. The use of ordinary members of the community to consider crimes was unusual in ancient cultures, but was nonetheless also found in ancient Greece."https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/..."the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.""-Thomas Jefferson</comment>

<comment>“It is impossible to rightly govern a nation without God and the Bible”    - George Washington</comment>

<comment>Washington was by all accounts a pretty piously Christian guy (as were most men of European descent at the time) - but he never said that.http://www.religioustolerance....</comment>

<comment>Wow "lying for Jesus"!!</comment>

<comment>Only three of the Ten Commandments are embodied in our criminal law.  The prohibitions of theft, murder and perjury.</comment>

<comment>And three of the 10 Commandments are unconstitutional: No other gods, no graven images, no taking the Lord's name in vain.</comment>

<comment>yeah, english common law has nothing to do with the US constitution.  not even a little...oh, and common law didn't exist before christianity arrived to the British Isles.</comment>

<comment>Andrew Jackson was an assshole.</comment>

<comment>Andrew Jackson was hardly Christian in his behavior, though perhaps he was Biblical in his ethics, in that he killed a man with a gun and conducted a campaign of genocide.</comment>

<comment>In what possible way would that be proof that America is a "Christian nation"? You aren't very bright.</comment>

<comment>Considering that said building wasn't constructed until 1935, I suspect that the Founding Fathers had very little to do with sticking Moses in there....</comment>

<comment>Liar</comment>

<comment>Does that mean that the phrase "under God" is not neutral?</comment>

<comment>As I understand it, the phrase "Under God" wasn't the brainchild or the original framers of the Constitution - it didn't appear on US currency, in the Pledge, etc., until well into the 20th Century.</comment>

<comment>That is correct"Religious liberty" is inherently an egalitarian concept and has no place in the modern world. Majority supremacy is a much more rational social policyA majority Christian should privilege Christianity, a majority Muslim country should privilege Islam, and so forth</comment>

<comment>Why should the majority be privileged?</comment>

<comment>wrong questionWhy should a minority be equal?majority supremacy is normative, even questioning it is problematic</comment>

<comment>Lots of white liberals are gonna learn this the hard way in another decade or two...</comment>

<comment>daily reminder never to help an egalitarian in need regardless of their raceits highly dysgenic</comment>

<comment>Learn what? That the Constitution is an intrusion upon 'majoritorian' mobs defining 'liberty'?</comment>

<comment>The exact opposite, actually. </comment>

<comment>Your missed the snark. Though I hadn't put in a "/s", I didn't do so because the snark was obvious. Rule by the mob majority is what the Fathers of the Constitution were trying to avoid.</comment>

<comment>Because, O Asian one, we are not a nation of majorities and minorities. We are a nation of individuals - all minorities of one.</comment>

<comment>You are an idiot.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Ah, another American who does not understand 'why' there is a Constitution with provisions like the First and other Amendments nor what the phrase 'tyranny of the majority' means.And, no doubt, you are prepared to invoke that very Constitution if your 'rights' get trampled upon.The United States is a Constitutional Republic that does not embrace unrestrained majority supremacy in its politics.</comment>

<comment>everyone's favorite sock puppet.pesky equality, hampering the big shots like yourself...</comment>

<comment>That's not in the constitution Terry, but a lot of language defending the rights of minorities against the majority IS in the constitution</comment>

<comment>America's civil society and democratic institutions are historically intertwined with Christianity. Not to mention the entire moral and cultural context of Western civilization.</comment>

<comment>@ Joe. So what?  They are also intertwined with classic Greek civilization,  the 18thcentury enlightenment ideas of john Locke etc, the Iriquois confederation ideas about governance, and a bunch of other cultural and ethical ideas.  The constitution does not mention religion, except in a negative sense, and the framers did that quite deliberately</comment>

<comment>Establishing a national religion is not the same thing as a society having a deeply religious character. The US is certainly more Christian than it is Greek or Iroquois.That is not to say it is the single defining feature - if I had to pick one it would be the ideas of the Enlightenment. But it would not make sense to pretend America is neutral on the idea of religion. It is pluralistic, but not indifferent to religion.</comment>

<comment>very few people are neutral about religion.  Yes, pluralistic,  and nobody gets to use the power or money of the state to promote one religion over another or theism over atheism or agnosticism.  if you can agree to that, we are in agreement.</comment>

<comment>What did antonio scalia alive do for religious liberty?Hopefully he's burning in his own hell,if he ever believed in it.Maybe he's just a dead axxhole.</comment>

<comment>I don't blame liberals for being happy at his death. He forgot more over his life than they will ever know. Intellectual god. RIP.The republic died with you, sir. Trump 2016</comment>

<comment>Religious Freedom is impossible.Additionally, too many religions make demands on their followers that are incompatible to modern life and values.</comment>

<comment>That is why we need a strict constitutionalist.</comment>

<comment>The worship of "modern life and values" is one of those religions.</comment>

<comment>Right. If you don't agree with someone's beliefs or way of life, just label them a religion and declare that you've won the argument.Sorry. Replied to the wrong comment. Meant to reply to mintap.</comment>

<comment>"Scalia doesn't fit easily into a narrative about American conservatism." This article gives no support for that statement whatsoever.  Consider your two examples of where he did not find for so-called "freedom of religion".  One: he didn't support the right of native Americans to use Peyote in religious rituals. But surely that's exactly what one would expect from an American conservative? Two: he favored the death penalty despite the American Catholic church's official position on the matter. But again--that's exactly what you'd expect from a conservative (and the tendency of American Catholics to support the death penalty has been often noted). In fact, you have the story exactly backwards. Scalia was a classic conservative. What he was not is a man of principle.</comment>

<comment>But he sure faked principle when he wanted to.</comment>

<comment>Well, George Burns said that it is all about sincerity -- when you can fake that, you got it made.</comment>

<comment>Whenever you quote that, you oughta sign off with, "Sincerely yours..."</comment>

<comment>But above all, he was committed to a literal, originalist interpretation of the Constitution, along with strict attention to the texts of federal and state laws.Emma, you blithering idiot. Scalia was committed to a far right interpretation of the Constitution. The phony "originalist" doctrine was merely the most efficacious mask for doing so, in most cases. Scalia, of course, dumped this pretense at interpretation whenever it suited him. See, for example, his disgusting vote in Bush v. Gore.</comment>

<comment>As Scalia said numerous times of his Bush v Gore vote:Deal With It.</comment>

<comment>God, in His infinite wisdom, did just that yesterday.</comment>

<comment>God tells us to deal with it several times each day.</comment>

<comment>You must be really cued in. He tells me nothing.</comment>

<comment>I don't know whether it was God or Satan that called Scalia away from this mortal plane, but I doubt that either wanted to see him rule on Woman's World v. Cole, the Texas abortion case which will be argued on March 2.</comment>

<comment>Isn't Satan, or at least the Antichrist, the present junior senator from Texas and presidential aspirant?</comment>

<comment>So far, religious liberty is fine, even in places where Christians are the minority, like Europe. The biggest threat to religious liberty is using extremist terrorists to justify religious discrimination. So far, it has only been applied against Muslims, but it could just as easily be applied to any other religion.</comment>

<comment>Is religious liberty for Christians just fine in Muslim majority countries?</comment>

<comment>Who cares?</comment>

<comment>Shhh... Grown folks're talkin </comment>

<comment>That isnt the question, dumb ass, what other countries do gas little to do with our Constitution nor how it is interpreted.People like you make me sick.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>I hope you feel better.</comment>

<comment>This is the fundamental flaw exposed in Republican conservative views....they want religious liberty only when it applies to Christians, but then they want the Constitution amended or ignored when in comes to other's rights. They want freedom to shoot people with guns but then want the government to have the power over who lives and dies in prison. They want strict Constitutional dogma when it comes to freedom of speech but want the Federal government to fine people or imprison people who dont say the right things. They want freedom to practice their faith but want the Federal government to ban gays, monitor Muslims, and force state laws against Non-Christians openly practicing their faith in public schools. Hypocrites....thats what Ted Cruz and the radical GOP are.Which is it conservatives? Follow the Constitution or follow some laws you impose on us? Are we free or some if us are free???? </comment>

<comment>I have long thought the Republicans should abandon Conservativism for Nationalism.</comment>

<comment>You really mean "white" nationalism don't you?</comment>

<comment>No need for the scare quotes. White people have existed for 4 or 5 thousand years. We aren't going anywhere.</comment>

<comment>Brown and black people have also existed for that long and longer. "White" is a pretty recent innovation advantageous for vitamin D absorption and not much else.Back to the question. Do you mean "white' nationalism or a rainbow nationalism?</comment>

<comment>Do you still beat your wife?</comment>

<comment>I'm not married.Why do you avoid such a simple question. You can answer yes, you mean white nationalism, or no, you mean nationalism that includes all creeds, all colors, gays, etc.Which is it?</comment>

<comment>wtf is a "white" person?</comment>

<comment>You mean they haven't?</comment>

<comment>reactionaries are not know for adhering to logic.  they just want things to stay the same, whatever that even means...</comment>

<comment>I don’t think Scalia ever had a coherent concept of “religious liberty” that he was willing to apply both to his own religious beliefs and other people’s.  In his Hobby Lobby ruling, for example, why does he say that the religious beliefs of Christian Scientists do not deserve the same protection as those of people opposed to artificial birth control?  He gives no reasoning to justify that at all.Thank you for mentioning an example of how he ignored the Magesterium of his own church when it suited him.  Of course, he lectured Anthony Kennedy that, if a judge’s opinion of what the Constitution meant ever conflicted with his personal religious beliefs, the only principled course of action was to resign.</comment>

<comment>"Religious liberty" means what exactly? Is it the line drawn between government and individual religious belief, or the line drawn between government and organized religion, or what?This is one of those arenas where "originality" is really not much help because modern questions about where to draw these lines are way different from anything the great and wonderful founders anticipated. Sort of like gun control.</comment>

<comment>Antonin Scalia was in the habit of saying that the Framers of the Constitution agreed with him about everything.  That wasn’t true.</comment>

<comment>Abraham Lincoln agreed with everything I have ever said. So did Jesus. And no one can prove I am wrong.</comment>
