<comment>A more accurate headline, "Supreme Court finds cause to halt EPA's unprecedented power grab."</comment>

<comment>You're celebrating a finding that will make this planet a harder place to live.  That's kind of insane.</comment>

<comment>No harder than living in a country that has forsaken Constitutional government in favor of political correctness and feelings.</comment>

<comment>In what way?  Be specific</comment>

<comment>Climate Change is a threat to everyone living on the planet.  Rising sea levels will wipe out coastal cities (and, eventually, several states).  Rising aggregate temperatures threaten agriculture.  Increasing levels of CO2 are causing the world's oceans to become acidic, which threatens to wipe out most of the world's coral reefs (and all of the sea life that requires those reefs to live).  Food and clean water shortages threaten to increase the number and severity of resource wars around the globe.  Mass migrations due to the loss of inhabitable land will make the Syrian refugee crisis look quaint.Those are some major crises that will threaten our continued existence.  There are probably more negative consequences of Climate Change, but they don't come to mind at the moment.</comment>

<comment>The climate ALWAYS changes. Claming you or anyone else knows what causes it to change is TOTAL FANTASY.Global Waming a radical-fundamentalist secular religion. </comment>

<comment>As I assumed you are completely ignorantBoth warming and c02 is good for life on earthThe catastrophic predictions of the future involve sea level rise and flooding of coastal cities.  Everyone else would benefit</comment>

<comment>What revolting hubris,  you claim to know the future.  Total insanity!</comment>

<comment>Liberals celebrated every time they killed construction of new nuclear plant..</comment>

<comment>CO2=Y2KRemaining Goregressives;If science doesn't need to agree a global CO2 crisis is as real as smoking causing cancer then what is stopping another 35 years of debate, denial and climate action failure?Are the science gods that you eager "believers" exaggerate also only 99% sure the planet isn't flat? Who's the fear mongering neocon again here?*Occupy no longer even mentions CO2 in it's list of demands so follow the herd like good progressives.</comment>

<comment>You know that the climate IS changing right? And that the sea level IS rising, right?Regardless of if it's anthropogenic or not this is going to be a major issue in the near future. At the very least we are going to be the root cause of the collapse of biodiversity on earth, so maybe we should attempt to steer away from this 'rape the earth' course we are on, even if extra carbon isn't behind warming.On another note, blindly ignoring science because you think there is a global conspiracy to trick people into not using as much fuel sounds just as idiotic as you think it does.</comment>

<comment>Risings seas ain't nothin for us folks in flyover country to worry on, is it?</comment>

<comment>Is that where all of this hatred is coming from?  People in the coastal regions have stereotypes in their heads about people living in the mid-west, and so you're hoping that their homes are washed away by the rising ocean?</comment>

<comment>Especially not because there is less than 2mm per year of sea level rise</comment>

<comment>Even a small aggregate sea level change can have large negative consequences:  http://ocean.nationalgeographi...From the article:  "When sea levels rise rapidly, as they have been doing, even a small increase can have devastating effects on coastal habitats. As seawater reaches farther inland, it can cause destructive erosion, flooding of wetlands, contamination of aquifers and agricultural soils, and lost habitat for fish, birds, and plants.When large storms hit land, higher sea levels mean bigger, more powerful storm surges that can strip away everything in their path.In addition, hundreds of millions of people live in areas that will become increasingly vulnerable to flooding. Higher sea levels would force them to abandon their homes and relocate. Low-lying islands could be submerged completely."</comment>

<comment>Less than 2mm per yearAnd it was rising at the same rate 100 years agoIf you want to build better levees I'd support that.  But nobody in New York seems worried.</comment>

<comment>Maybe not, but the dust bowl wasn't much fun.</comment>

<comment>As long as you don't live near the Missouri or the Mississippi rivers.</comment>

<comment>NYC was supposed to be underwater by now according to Gore. The end is nigh is nonsense.</comment>

<comment>Ever tried taking the subway from Brooklyn to Manhattan after a major rainstorm? You can't because the pumps that prevent the stations from flooding all the time can't keep up after a heavy rain.</comment>

<comment>That's been an issue since they were built. </comment>

<comment>Whatever you have to tell yourself.We are DESTROYING this planet in 10000 other ways, regardless of if climate change is 'our fault' or not; it doesn't matter. Not really sure why people can't understand that simple fact.</comment>

<comment>The environment has improved over the last half century due to technology. </comment>

<comment>You're going to sit there and tell me that we aren't destroying the planet with our practices in many places?Are you SERIOUSLY going to make that argument?You people are unbelievable.</comment>

<comment>Yes because that is reality. </comment>

<comment>No, it's not.Rainforests are still being deforested which creates more deserts, which creates a crapload more carbon in the air. Permafrost and lakes are melting that haven't melted since before the last ice age, and they are releasing methane into the atmosphere... in case you didn't know, and I bet you didn't, methane is about 20 times more harmful than CO2 is.50% of the animals in the ocean and 50% of the animals on land are at risk for extinction, MOSTLY BECAUSE of habitat loss, environmental destruction caused by mining, and invasive species spread; ALL THINGS THAT ARE OUR FAULT.That's just a couple things that are happening, there is a much bigger list that you should familiarize yourself with.You know nothing about science, and definitely NOTHING about environmental science. Maybe just keep your idiotic opinions to yourself until you can actually do some research and backup your moronic statements.</comment>

<comment>Your predictions of the future are garbage and have been proven wrong time and time againYour grasp of science is poorYou could not even explain this global warming theory to me, you think it's about c02 but of course only 1/5 of the warming the IPCC predicts comes from c02.  The rest involves a very wild hypothesis.  Can you explain how it works?</comment>

<comment>Your grasp of ignorance is strong.  Even Exxon's scientific research agrees and then they hid it.</comment>

<comment>So...can you even explain how the catastrophic theory works then?I'll give you a hint:  Feedbacks</comment>

<comment>What year is it? Does Google not exist in your country? Can you not look up 'how it works' from 10000 sources?The answer is 'yes you can'. You're just being a smarmy douchebag that thinks they're being edgy by denying climate change. You're just an idiot with no idea of how to use the internet apparently... you should take a class or something.</comment>

<comment>Are you saying you don't think Y2K wasn't an issue?</comment>

<comment>Well, there is one big difference between the two issues:  We actually took effective action to prevent the Y2K disaster.</comment>

<comment>I agree as I worked on Y2K for my employer.  My guess is that B.J.D. thinks Y2K wasn't a real issue either.  And is clueless that there wasn't an issue because companies invested in resolving it.</comment>

<comment>Its much worse than Y2K ... with Y2K only a small handful of programmers and consultants made modest paydays ... with CO2 guys like Tom Steyr and other other connected people will make trillions.</comment>

<comment>Drill baby drillI love how this screws over Obama's diplomatic agenda.</comment>

<comment>This has nothing to do with oil drilling smart guy . . .</comment>

<comment>Didn't you hear, they stopped drilling since the price of oil collapsed from above $100 in June 2014 to a 12-year low of $27.10 last month</comment>

<comment>LOLYou mean Obama can't make laws up all by himself. I mean who could know?The four lib justices didn't write a dissent because their reason is obvious. They are Obama puppets</comment>

<comment>The green "end is nigh" rot is as nonsensical as the Mayan Apocalypse.</comment>

<comment>You mean the Mayan Apocalypse that happened? The one that destroyed their civilization by overuse of their environment?</comment>

<comment>Except the evidence is for political decline. You don't have population decline until the virgin soil epidemics. </comment>

<comment>So now China becomes the de facto leader for implementing the Paris Climate accord.  Congratulations to totalitarianism and a wave at the wimpy executive action ploy by the Obama-ites as they sit in their broken down car.</comment>

<comment>He just used executive actions because Congress is full of deranged science haters.  If the GOP could get their heads out of their asses and admit that we have a huge problem staring us in the face, they could pass legislation that would more effectively combat climate destruction.  Instead, they are on course to screw us all.</comment>

<comment>The coal needs to stay in the ground. The long term (global warming) and short term cost is too high, yes even in developing countries and China, which is choking on its own emissions.</comment>

<comment>The planet is melting! The planet is melting! The planet is melting!Whew, I feel so much better now.</comment>

<comment>Nah, it's not melting, but it's undeniably warming.</comment>

<comment>and it will cool again ... just like it always has</comment>

<comment>Yup, once the humans have perished.</comment>

<comment>"The coal needs to stay in the ground."Exactly.  Even a free market would wind up with coal not being used.  Existing policy is merely propping up the dirtiest buggy-whip manufacturers of our era.</comment>

<comment>As long as you're happy buying all of your steel and other coal made materials,  from offshore companies, you're right.</comment>

<comment>Most of it would have if the US would have built nuclear plants in the 70's.... but the Liberals killed that plan....</comment>

<comment>I think the fact that all the predictions made by the warmists from 20 and 30 years ago were totally wrong and we did not get the warming or sea level rise that was predicted hurt his climate change plan more than anything.Their theory has fallen apart to the point where they now deny the satellite data</comment>

<comment>Try telling that to folks in Miami when their streets have been flooding more and more with each new storm. Or tell me why my daffodils keep popping up in January and February in the northeast.</comment>

<comment>The sea is rising at a rate of less than 2mm per yearFlooding in Florida has nothing to do with thisAnything else?</comment>

<comment>The theory has not fallen apart.  That's just a right wing talking point.http://www.scientificamerican....</comment>

<comment>Yes it hasThat's why your editorial offers no evidence of future catastrophe.Infact they didn't even acknowledge the sat data at all so they are on a level below denier.</comment>

<comment>It is easier to watch Koch Brothers dig themselves further into debt than bother fighting it out with Appalachia. They'll all go bankrupt long  before u put a padlock on their doors. Then the taxpayer will look back at how Koch left them with clean up bills in the billions, scratch their heads and continue to follow along the Republican highway. They'll pick up their guns and start shooting those darn eastern bankers holding squirrels hostage in the bayou.</comment>

<comment>This post is funny.</comment>

<comment>Nuke Bambi.</comment>

<comment>I'm glad I'm wealthy enough to avoid most of the consequences of conservatives' bad decisions. Most conservatives are not.</comment>

<comment>HA HA HA .... that Anti-American Islamist Obama got slapped down by the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>Kind of like how Exxon and all the other U.S. oil companies are getting slapped down by OPEC's production going full speed. It's funny watching who will lose out in the price wars between the Middle East and domestic oil companies.</comment>
