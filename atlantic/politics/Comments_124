<comment>There is video of the reading of the verdict showing  Hortzclaw having a complete and utter breakdown: https://youtu.be/RCOLxrwMqmI. The verdict represented justice for the women. And the video was satisfying to watch. </comment>

<comment>Perfect!</comment>

<comment>There is no "justice" for these or any girls and women raped. The sentence for even one rape ought be life in prison; it used to be a capital crime and, quite frankly, still ought be. Rape is the broken brain male extreme use of physical force to show utter contempt for the life of any female. It is intended to permanently injure and traumatize them, along with often those around them, for their entire life. Males know this. Far too females do not. </comment>

<comment>Capital punishment serves vengeance, not justice.Let this criminal endure the life of a cop in prison.</comment>

<comment>Just to note: Your sentence also reeks the aroma of implied  vengeance.</comment>

<comment>I liked the irony.</comment>

<comment>The only part of this I don't like is that my tax dollars will pay for his prison costs.</comment>

<comment>"I don't like is that my tax dollars will pay for his prison costs."But, more of them would be necessary to execute him.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm, maybe but the cost of prison room and board and medical care over an entire life time must be pretty steep.  I'm not up on those facts of cost of incarceration vs execution.</comment>

<comment>I have a funny feeling that he's not going to live out a normal lifespan. I think there's a prison shank in his future.</comment>

<comment>I see buttrape in his future.</comment>

<comment>hopefully buried deep in his poop shute</comment>

<comment>Might want to inform yourself on those facts instead of guessing.</comment>

<comment>MZale is correct. It is actually more expensive to execute a person than to keep him in jail for a long time.</comment>

<comment>Cheaper than the court costs associated with execution.  Far cheaper.</comment>

<comment>The tax payer cost of an execution far exceeds that of a lifetime of incarceration when you consider the legal process an execution requires.</comment>

<comment>the system is fractured from the top to the bottomas one commenter here said let's not fall into the notion that no one in the department knew this guy was a predator.  he looks mentally unstable for starters....</comment>

<comment>money well spent</comment>

<comment>"I don't like is that my tax dollars will pay for his prison costs."I understand.However, factoring in "costs" is a bad thing when applied to moral issues or matters of justice.</comment>

<comment>I get where you're going with that....what's the cost of medical and psychological care and a life time sentence of PTSD for 13 women and each of their family members?  Cost is a relevant issue in the ethical discussion like it or not.</comment>

<comment>"Cost is a relevant issue in the ethical discussion like it or not."You bring up a related issue, but not what I was addressing - nor will I.Cost is not relevant for determining whether to execute, release, or jail for life.</comment>

<comment>I understand your thinking and appreciate your point of view.</comment>

<comment>Given the stage of Americas prisons, he's going to endure torture and rape..pretty much guaranteed..at the hands of borne the inmates and the guards. Seems like the punishment fits the crime.</comment>

<comment>I've always found "I don't want my tax dollars to go toward _____" to be a specious argument. Part of everybody's tax dollars go to certain things they don't agree with.Try thinking of it this way: your tax dollars are going to keep this predator away from possible future victims. Surely that's a worthy goal, no?</comment>

<comment>I suppose....but would be happier if we could separate him from his male genitalia and let him go.  Nature will take it from there.  Why waste $$ on this F-tard?</comment>

<comment>Rape is more about power than sex. Claw liked lording it over these women, but was too stupid to realize the last victim would have his dick in the slammer before he could get a good night's sleep. Had he not picked on her, he might still be at it.</comment>

<comment>You know, life in prison can be a fate worse than death for certain criminals....particularly sex offenders! He's gonna WISH for death row when he ends up as Bubba's girlfriend.</comment>

<comment>There is no way that an ex-cop will wind up in the general population in prison. He will be placed in protective custody or even solitary confinement if his safety is threatened in the protective custody unit.</comment>

<comment>If you think that prison rape doesn't happen in protective custody.....think again.</comment>

<comment>If you are replying to me, kindly note that I wrote that he could wind up in solitary confinement if he is threatened while in protective custody. It happens all the time, particularly when juveniles are sentenced to serve time in adult prisons.It's one reason that I do not agree with juveniles being locked up with adults. They should be allowed to serve time in juvenile facilities until they are old enough to be transferred to an adult prison. I also think that juveniles should have the opportunity to be rehabilitated in all but the most egregious of cases. There is a much better possibility of rehabilitation if a juvenile is remanded to the juvenile justice system.</comment>

<comment>You love the idea of rape as punishment. You are a fking douchebag. And no fkstk, rape cannot happen in isolation.</comment>

<comment>Your view of prison is childlike. The people in prison want one thing......to get out. You do not get out when you assault people. You get more time. Dumbfks, like you, seem to think that the guys in prison are superheros, out to right the wrongs that straight society cannot. Grow up. People in prison may do violent things, but it is a personal issue. They are not going to give up any more freedom because something happened to someone they never heard of.  And.........the fact the you want anybody raped...........you are also a douche.</comment>

<comment>Guess what dumbdumb, some people in prison are never getting out! So why should lifers give a f*ck about good behavior? Besides, many prison guards look the other way when new inmates get *turned out*. So don't try to tell me that inmates have ANY incentive whatsoever to keep it in their pants.Another thing you don't get is that how you're treated by other inmates depends on what you did to get into prison. Sex offenders are at the very bottom of the prison social order and particularly pedophiles.Nobody said that prisoners are good people. But a rapist getting buggered in prison is poetic justice.</comment>

<comment>What you are saying is bullshit. I have been there. Sounds like you like talking about buggery. Your rectum is probably wider than the Rio Grande. By the way fktard..................people who are in for life are kept separate in most prisons for that exact reason."So don't try to tell me that inmates have ANY incentive whatsoever to keep it in their pants."Just like you huh? Love gay sex do ya? Too funny.</comment>

<comment>How much of the thought behind rape being a capital crime was due to the notion that raping a women devalued her to her family? After being raped, she was no longer worth as much to her father and no longer was considered a prospect for marriage and a family. That was the reasoning behind "a fate worse than death".While any assault causes significant trauma and damage, we no longer consider that the mere fact of being raped causes a stain upon the victim, who is then expected to withdraw from life because she is "damaged goods".</comment>

<comment>Rape as a capital crime existed to murder black males, period.  There are some cases of white males executed for rape (Caryl Chessman was not executed for rape, but for kidnapping, which was a very specious charge in his case), but the overwhelming majority of people executed for rape (more than 90%) was for the rape of a white woman by a black male.  There isnt a single example of a white male executed for the rape of a black woman in US history.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Thank you for trying to educate the sheeple</comment>

<comment>Rape is a Republican crime.</comment>

<comment>Maybe on some level....as a female my wide perspective is that it is resulting from a long standing patriachy that needs and supports the brutalization of women as a method of control through terrorizing a class of people.  That mind set is equally shared across political spectrums in my experience as a person walking through life with breasts and a vagina, just sayin'</comment>

<comment>omg.  no no no.  do you live in a third world country?  then no, you are not brutalized as a method of control by men. not even close.  it's offensive to third world women and first world men to even say things like that.</comment>

<comment>Uh, you realize that the right to be pregnant at work without being summarily fired, the right to access contraception, the right to not be legally raped by a spouse, and ANY awareness of domestic violence as a crime, let alone a custody issue, have all come about in my lifetime, right? These brutalities are very close and not very quiet for many of us standing right in front of you. What is insulting to first world men is that you are this ignorant about the lives of the women around you. </comment>

<comment>no no no. hyperbole, strawmen arguments,distortion of facts and/or presenting them out of context, oh and the ol' "you don't understand because you're not a woman" ad hominem attack.  You packed them all in there.I'll admit that the descriptions i've heard of the 1950s doesn't sound awesome for women, but we've clearly made some changes since then, and some of the things you claim were the case, weren't really the case, at least not in the hyperbolic way in which they were stated.There was no law that allowed husbands to rape their wives. There just wasn't a law or judicial interpretation that defined any sex between spouses as rape.I'm glad you brought up domestic violence.   Today there are actually tons of resources for battered women.  That's great.  There aren't very many for men. In fact, i'm guessing, your response to that would be some sexist assertion about how men don't need it. We can't be victims. because patriarchy.  I'm a whiny brat for asserting that it could be possible that i might need it.Also glad you brought up custody issues and reproductive rights.  Again, women have had those for decades.  Men, on the other hand, do not. And never have.  In the past, men always kept custody BECAUSE it was considered their sole burden to care for the kids of the parents separated. If the woman wanted to take off, there were no child support checks.When you consider that, it doesn't seem like a patriarchal conspiracy.  Even today, if a woman chooses to bring the child to term, and wants child support, the man has no choice and will be labeled a dead beat if he doesn't cough up money.  Not nearly as strong of a stigma exists for mothers who give up their kids for adoption, abort it, or drop it off at a firestation even.When you wanted to go to college (which women do nowadays at increasingly higher rates), did you have to sign up for the draft? Did you realize that was one of the original justifications for so-called "universal suffrage" during the Jackson presidency.   Many thought insurrection would ensue if men were forced to fight but not allowed to vote.   Many in the suffragettes movement were afraid that gaining the right to vote would mean a similar duty of involuntary servitude.Is this a travesty for men? no,  not really.  It's definitely no brutal,What is insulting to everyone is that you think you can just say, "you're not a woman, so you clearly wouldn't understand what it's like to be me."  Do you think that's an argument? Do you not see that blatant fallacy in that line of reasoning? I mean, i realize you're a troll, so you're intentionally by hyperbolic, and I probably shouldn't feed you, but seriously,  be better.  To act like the situation in the US (where it wouldn't be unusual if you were writing this tripe from your latest generation iPhone, while sipping premium espresso, at the coffee shop down the street from the place you're allowed to and can independently afford by yourself, to and from which you can choose to drive or walk alone without fear of being harmed or anyone thinking it unusual.) is or was similar in non trivial ways to say, Saudi Arabia, is outrageous. I mean, women are stoned in places like the middle east for the crime of being raped.   Today, i watched a cop get sentenced in the US to 263 years in prison for rape.</comment>

<comment>The last state to outlaw spousal rape did so in 1993. You are literally wrong there. It was not illegal to rape your wife. Most of the other rights were codified in the 70s. Women continue to be distinctly more likely to be injured, hospitalized or killed by domestic violence than men. Not to discount male victims or imply that women aren't violent, but the social harm of domestic violence disproportionately falls to women. Sticking women with the burden and privilege of childcare has been a mixed blessing based upon sexist assumptions, but I brought it up in the context of domestic violence, which courts did not recognize in divorce settlements until recent decadesIf you seriously think women should shut up because they have iPhones and espresso, try that on for size yourself, quit your whining about giving women equal justice, equal credence, equal consideration for their concerns, and get over yourself. It's just not that much of a tragedy to finish this job. </comment>

<comment>it was not explicitly legal to rape your wife.  it also wasn't explicitly illegal.  you act like we overturned a law that said it was legal to rape your wife.  no no no.Men are more likely to be victims of violence over all.  It has also been shown that women are at least as likely as men to instigate physical violence.  Lesbian and gay couples have the highest rates of domestic abuse.  yet all the resources go to women.  who cares who's more likely to be a victim or suffer more harm at the margin, the point is, men don't have public resources in this regard yet still are often victims. zero resources.   women have some.   equality here would mean increasing the amount of resources devoted to male victims of violence.   I mean, if you're all for equality, then you should be focusing on how men are ot getting resources in this regard proportional to their suffering (because they get 0).  That doesn't mean women should get less, in fact, it could still be the case that we ought to devote more to women in absolute terms.  You're making the argument for me.yes, perhaps courts didn't consider domestic violence decades ago.  That's my point.  decades ago.  the world i grew up in wasn't like this, the males i grew up with weren't raised to be sexist predators. we grew up in a world where girls were told from the get-go that they were equal to us and no one questioned it.  so stop focusing on what was decades ago and what is actually the case today.  And, today, it's clear based on your failure to respond to most of my examples of inequality where men are on the losing side, that it's not immediately obvious that women are the victims of some patriarchal, sub-conscious manspiracy."right to be pregnant at work without being summarily fired..."  -  are you kidding me?   Do you think women were fired for being pregnant per se?  No no no. they were let go in many circumstances, because most profit seeking employers don't like to continue investing in an employee they know will at least go on a lengthy maternity leave, and often choose not to come back at all.    Now, we can argue the merits of that, and i'm not necessarily that's justified, but that's a lot different than getting fired because you're pregnant per se.you're like, really, really bad at arguing.  Your last paragraph is a blatant straw man.  do you not understand that i was drawing a comparison between a modern woman's life in the US vs , say, Afghanistan?   Of course women shouldn't shut up.  After all, this isn't Afghanistan where women are actually brutalized in a non-hyperbolic sense.  And then the same, "you're not a woman, so that's why you're not understanding ad hominem. "to claim that you're brutalized given the existence of places like afghanistan where women actually are brutalized, is like the libertarian who says he's enslaved because of taxes.  An insult to victims of chattel slavery.It's people like you that give feminism a bad name.  A whole bunch of ad hominem attacks, straw man, appeals to emotion, deliberate distortion of  stats, etc.</comment>

<comment>"It was not explicitly legal to rape your wife." "you're like, really really bad at arguing"This is all I really need to be able to dismiss this conversation. You've obviously got an axe to grind in recreational debate and clearly don't actually give a damn about the issues you're talking about, particularly domestic violence. Yes, I hold your arguments in contempt, because really? This is about whether your delicate feelings can bear to call injustices against women "brutalities." And that's just not worth anyone's time.Call me up when you have spent less than zero time actually helping male victims instead of whining against feminism on the internet. You're talking to an advocate. </comment>

<comment>i'm sorry, i am still waiting for a valid argument.  you seem to love demonizing your opponent to avoid addressing the merits of their argument.  It's kindof sad.  Just a lot of angry ranting about how anyone who disagrees with you is obviously callous, uncaring, and mysogynistic.   The vacuity in your reasoning makes me feel sporry for you.</comment>

<comment>btw, i was a male victim of rape (by a female, GF).    So i was at one point an advocate for myself, and one of the biggest challenges men face is that every time we assert the need for a voice, resources, etc, there's someone like you who flips the eff out and acts like no additional resources should be devoted toward men until all women's issues (valid or not, caused by men or no) have somehow been solved.  And you call this equality.  The rest of society calls that childishness.</comment>

<comment>In your anger, you have consistently misread my actual comments in order to peddle your own view. I am NOT against resources for male victims. I am in favor of resources proportionate to harm. And it's been feminism that I've seen go to the mats for male victims suffering from patriarchal ideas that they can't be victims, that they don't deserve a consent culture, and that they can't be raped because they should be able to fight back or speak up. I've seen the advocacy peddled by MRA's, and while I earnestly supported their mission, their work has done nothing but leave a horrible taste of harassment and hatred for women in the public's mouth without accomplishing real change.That is a horrible tragedy. But no one forced this reputation on the movement. They truly earned it. Feminism has championed ideas such as intersectionality and trans rights. It's been a highly effective political and intellectual movement that has enacted real and crucial changes. Have they gotten everything right? No. Are vapid people a part of it? Of course. But the movement has done more for people JUST LIKE YOU by dismantling rape culture than any other movement can claim. And while I'm horribly tempted to say you're claiming victimhood status in order to compete in an argument, feminism teaches me not to be so cold. So I believe you.I've actually been TRYING to advocate the equality you've been complaining about: one that recognizes that resources should go to people who are harmed, no matter who they are or who you believe they ought to be: disreputable, sex worker, male, trans or non-white. Have you really not noticed this? Did you also notice that your major defender on this thread has been saying that spousal rape doesn't exist because you can't rape what you already own? Are you down with that? If not, why aren't you responding to him about this odious idea?And no, I don't believe things are as bad here as they are in other parts of the world by a nice wide, comfortable margin. But that doesn't excuse me from advocating for what's right where I live. I vote for it. I argue for it. I volunteer at my local rape crisis center as a trained volunteer specializing in male victims of abuse. I've heard those terrible strangled sounds that men who do not cry make when they try to talk about this. And you know who offered me that training and tells me I ought to care about it? My feminist friends at the rape crisis center. You know who doesn't? Every single male I know. You know what they do? They laugh at the idea. Because they still can't conceive of how they could possibly end up on the losing side of rape culture.</comment>

<comment>anger -  i'm not angry?  Are you assuming i'm angry because i disagree with you? Generally, i don't let shrill, delusional conspiracy theorists anger me.   I let them entertain me.  That's why i keep responding.I'm not sure what an MRA is so can't comment on that.You're not arguing for proportional distribution of resources.  You originally supported the status quo where men get nothing, and women get all the public funds.   Looks like you're changing your tune now.  Glad you finally appreciated the inequity.The feminists that i run into on tumblr, facebook, etc.  The ones who deny that misandry exists, etc are the ones who are the loudest.  You may be the exception, but given your previous remarks about women being brutalized in america today, and crying about things that literally changed decades ago, before I was born, it's pretty obvious why anyone would confuse you with the the shrill, statistics manipulating, 1/4 women in college are raped, and anyone who suggests that a woman might lie is a rape apologist - type feminist.I'm glad that you're an advocate, but you need to recognize that most of the people who wear the feminist label are hostile toward men, call us rape apologists for disagreeing (similar to your ad hominem, fallacious attacs).Feminism is an advocacy group for women.  I largely don't see them advocating for men, transgendered folks (some of them are openly trans exclusive), etc anyone near the degree that they spend time trying to prove a great patriarchal conspiracy and demonizing the decent men that surround them.Also, maybe in the 50s, but definitely today.  There just isn't a rape culture to be dismantled today.  people think rape is wrong.  people don't need to be taught not to rape, that's condescendingly insulting.  As if people wouldn't no basic right from wrong without some morally superior feminist campaign educating them.  There is no rape culture in the West. At least, not in the world I grew up in.    It's a myth, propagated by feminists,  so they always have a battle cry to rally people with.  It's a similar strategy to neo conservatives.  An attempt to create a perpetual enemy, that can never be defeated in efforts to control people.</comment>

<comment>Dude, I give up. You literally accused me of ad hominem attack and did the exact thing you were criticizing *in the next sentence.* This was never about respectful debate or coming to united conclusion. It was about you feeling like you won because tumblr feminists hurt your feelings. It's disingenuous and a waste of time.</comment>

<comment>i'm not sure you understad what an ad hominem fallacy is.example:  "you're stupid"  = not an ad hominem, just an insultnext example: "your argument is wrong because you're stupid" = ad hominem fallacy, and an insult.I don't believe you've pointed out how i've tried to prove the merits of my argument, or the demerits of yours by insulting you.and did you just forget again to respond to some of the more salient points i made?   You have a nasty habit of just ignoring the stuff you can't refute.</comment>

<comment>also, the fact the someone may act hypocritically with respect to their convictions, does not make the merit of their conviction wrong, necessarily.  That would be a tu quoque fallacy.</comment>

<comment>Women today are such narcissistic crybabies that it's impossible to respect them. Do you really think a woman is entitled to keep her job when she gets pregnant? She's not. An employer should be allowed to fire ANY employee who goes out and finds another job that interferes with the first one. Do you really believe there was ever a time when women haven't had access to birth control? They've generally had more control over their reproduction than men. Perhaps what you really mean is that the government has only recently taken to paying for it. And how can a husband possibly rape his wife? That's like buying something in a store and then arresting the shopkeeper for stealing your money.</comment>

<comment>I'll turn that right around and call you a crybaby for being THIS concerned about the women's movement closing the gap of equal justice. Seriously. Grow a pair."how can a husband possibly rape his wife" aaaand we're done. I don't do debate with rape apologists. It wastes everyone's time.</comment>

<comment>Dear ithink: your mindset and lack of even HALF a clue is what's been moving us rapidly toward religious fascism at the eager hands of the American Taliban aka the Rethuglicans funded by the terrorist styled religious right.  you have no idea of the political reality and danger of this current time in our collective herstory here in Murica.In the last 4 years alone over 250 new laws forcing women into compliance with a very narrow set of religious belief systems based on male religious leaders who dominated state legislatures in a direct effort to support the american brand of sharia law based on one particular religion that openly states women should be controlled by their husbands.  Sound familar? D'oh!Number of laws giving the states power over male behavior.  ZERO, introduced or passed EVER.Please: THINK</comment>

<comment>can trolls cite sources?  just curious.  did you also know that tin foil hats are on sale at walmart?</comment>

<comment>Ahhhh, that precious moment when you reveal yourself to be uneducated, unable to discuss real things, and unwilling to be free of the American Taliban thought police.  Good luck with that.</comment>

<comment>mmmooohhhh kay.  is that supposed to be an argument?</comment>

<comment>the only religious group forcing women into compliance is Muslim and Sharia Law...not the "right"...how do you survive in the real world?</comment>

<comment>Really? Sexual harassment laws? Title IX? The Violence Against Women Act? The Clery Act? The states and the federal government have thousands of laws meant specifically to protect women, while regulating, terrorizing, or disadvantaging men.You seem to think that even more laws should exist to shame, silence, and disadvantage men, restricting them sexually as much as possible, while females should have absolutely no checks on their behavior whatsoever - complete reproductive freedom for them, while males cover their bills.I don't think we need to worry much about women "being controlled by their husbands."Marriage rates are plummeting, largely because marriage has become a legal minefield for men.Few of us have good reasons to get married - misandry in the courts and the general self centered nastiness of more than a few females has been very, very effective at releasing women from the burdens of marriage.(By which I mean that people such as yourself made marriage so hellish no man in his right mind would put himself through that meatgrinder.) </comment>

<comment>Jane, you're regurgitating a silly ideology that you've swallowed whole because it feeds your need to feel important and heroic. Nobody's oppressing you, get over yourself.</comment>

<comment>yeah, you're right....I live in a country where no one tries to legislate my rights away by virtue of their Talibanesque desire to have the power of religious tyranny over my body or my choices, where there has never been one law passed that attempts to interupt or legislate the freedom of men over their sexual choices or bodies, where I make the same amount of pay for equal work and that's a law, where no one questions my sexual choices or belittles them/me with demeaning social constructs meant to shame me or other women as a way to excuse the failures of males to truly value women and their children, where female images long ago stopped being used for sexualized marketing or the blatant and socially accepted sexual gratification of men, and I never have to reply to your brand of jackassery.  Oh wait.....</comment>

<comment>you make the same for equal work.  the 78 cents on the dollar bs has been debunked over and over. i'm sorry you have a paranoid. borderline schizophrenic view of men.   that's sad. I exist in a world where men, women, and all other gender identities treat eachother with respect. i'm sorry that femifascism has clouded your judgement.besides not being able to cite one verifiable or quantifiable expression of your pov</comment>

<comment>Cite your statistics that you claim debunk the unequal pay gap regarding pay.  I think your mommy toilet trained you harshly.</comment>

<comment>Google "78cents to the dollar myth."First two are articles from the WaPo and WSJ.  This common knowledge. </comment>

<comment>look at this chauvinistic jerk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>please stop posting. ..your stupidity is an embarrassment to all women..Equal Pay Act was passed in 1963</comment>

<comment>I see that you enjoy your shackles......</comment>

<comment>no...I enjoy the intelligence MOST women have</comment>

<comment>The more you talk, the more like a spoiled brat you sound. Nobody's oppressing you, you just get off on this nonsense. Grow up.</comment>

<comment>It's always clear that the vanguard of the American Taliban is speaking when individuals are unable to engage in civil discourse and default to attacks and insults when faced with viewpoints they disagree with and feel threatened by.  This is the underpinnings of dehumanizing groups and the first sign of the desire to oppress them.  You prove my point exceedingly well.  Thank You for demonstrating exactly what I've been talking about.</comment>

<comment>Well, you can't exactly complain that your opponents "are unable to engage in civil discourse and default to attacks and insults" in the very same thread you rant against "Rethuglicans".  Come on now.  But I'll bite because I'm also curious to hear a single, specific example of how you personally were oppressed by the "American Taliban".For example, I agree that women in Texas losing access to abortion clinics are getting a pretty raw deal...but if it's true that "in the last 4 years alone over 250 new laws forcing women into compliance with a very narrow set of religious belief system" were passed, can you provide an example of a time one of those laws made an impact on your (or my) daily life?</comment>

<comment>If it's such a small thing, get over your own self and get out of the way of the women's movement. If their claims are so small and insubstantial, just codify equal pay into law, quit shutting down abortion clinics, give equal credence to women's perspectives and concerns, and equal representation in media. Where's the big hunk of skin off your back?</comment>

<comment>omg, have you seen this? Apparently, we're worse than most of the developed world. http://www.euronews.com/2015/1...</comment>

<comment>Wow, man hate much? I really hope you never raised any sons.Men are not rapists, ma'am. Men are not violent criminals.You're confusing a tiny fraction of a % of the male population with the rest of us, like the racist who sees a black person committing a crime, and then assumes all blacks are criminals. </comment>

<comment>step away from the bong..your brain is fried</comment>

<comment>You speak of lynching by verdict...</comment>

<comment>I'm confused...are you saying black people are extra rapey, or extra stupid?  Cuz I'm no expert, but that sounds kinda racist.</comment>

<comment>Well, I would disagree that you arent an expert, because on top of being racist, you sound fairly stupid as well.If there is a crime and only one race has received the maximum punishment for that crime, it isnt the people who are convicted that are the issue, but the system that is responsible for sentencing those people to death.  You would have to be pretty stupid to not be able to recognize the inherent racism of the criminal justice system to not recognize the disparities.  There are a great many people who were able to recognize what my comment was referring to, the only one that seems to have missed the boat was you.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Rape is indeed a crime that demoralizes and demeans and is a trauma that scars its victims for life. While watching the video it was hard to determine how or why certain counts on which he was found guilty merited 8 years while others received 16 or 30 years. And the reality that if not for the fact he raped at least 13 women his sentence could have been less, he has cumulatively received 263 years which constitutes a life sentence. Not a life sentence for each count, but a life sentence overall. </comment>

<comment>Despite all the years recommended by the jury, it is quite possible that this former police officer will be out of prison in under 10 years, if not 5.Imagine that the time runs concurrently, that the former officer does not get 30 years for each charge, the accrual of 'good time' and the cut offs for parole and it is more than likely this man will be out of prison well before his 40th birthday.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>I thought the same as I watched the video of the verdicts being read. I hope we're wrong in this thought. I fear for other women if we're right.</comment>

<comment>Or the judge can reject the jury's recommendation period.</comment>

<comment>Prosecutor declared after verdict that he'd ask for consecutives, not concurrents. Claw's a gonner for life.</comment>

<comment>I hope you are correct, but given the state of things, I have little faith in our system to do the right thing on a consistent basis.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>There should be no capital crimes in the US and as soon as we get rid of that assclown Scalia, the Supreme Court will again rule the death penalty unconstitutional for the same reasons they did last time, only this time it will stick.You also dont seem to know much about rape as a capital crime, because it was one of the greatest miscarriages of justice that this country was ever involved in, outside of the institution of slavery.  Virginia is an example of what a racially motivated and driven punishment the death penalty was for rape: Every single person executed for rape while Virginia had electrocution as its form of execution was black.Every. Single. One.If that verifiable fact isnt capable of assisting you in seeing the error of your ways, I am not sure what would.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Rape used to be a capital crime because a woman had no value other than her sexual honor. That's not the case anymore. It's the opposite in fact. In our sexually liberated era, there's no qualitative difference between rape and other forms of physical assault.</comment>

<comment>Well there is poetic justice! He's gonna get raped many more times than his victims.</comment>

<comment>Yes ... he's an ex-cop, his daddy is still a cop, and he's a rapist of black women. Plus he's young and hung. Perfect for Bubba and his pals.</comment>

<comment>The death penalty for rape is a bad idea, because it provides an incentive to do away with the victim, who is also a witness.</comment>

<comment>If rape is a capital crime, it incentivizes murdering the victim after raping them because there would be no difference in potential punishment between rape alone and rape in conjunction with murder.  Murder ensures that the rape victim will remain silent about who committed the crime, so there would be every reason for the perpetrator to kill. Maintaining a differential punishment between the two felonies is in the interest of potential victims.</comment>

<comment>What a bizarre post, especially considering even as committed a feminist as Hanna Rosin, founder of Slate XX and author of "The End of Men" acknowledges that sexual violence is minimally gendered, if that,  in her scholarly "When Men Are Raped: A new study reveals that men are often the victims of sexual assault, and women are often the perpetrators." One can also go to as easily available a source as TIME magazine for such articles as "Congo’s Forgotten Epidemic of Female-on-Female Rape.""Rape is the broken brain male extreme"??  Hardly. Instead, rape is humanity, men and women, at its worst. Until we recognize this, people such as yourself will only continue to politicize rape to foment fear and hatred between men and women.</comment>

<comment>No need to. 30 years per rape - that's already 120 years only for the 4 of the first degree ones. More then enough for a life in prison.</comment>

<comment>Justice for the women, but also for the greater society.  Recent arguments for the unfettered support of all cops, based on the mistaken and illogical notion that they are all "good" and worthy, continue to be exposed for their fallaciousness.  The commitment to bringing malfeasor law enforcement officers to justice will only further add to the mounting, undeniable evidence that many of our departments/institutions are in great need of reform.</comment>

<comment>Nah, it was probably a coldly-calculated display in hopes of it affecting his ultimate sentence.He's almost certainly a sociopath, and expressions of emotion by sociopaths are merely affectations they've learned to adopt while in the presence of humans.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, the level of evil to systemically rape marginalized women comes not from any sort of mental illness, but from normal minds given entitlement, power, freedom from scrutiny, and the misogyny to disregard the lives of women. There is nothing wrong with his brain. That is a normal brain on a broken society.</comment>

<comment>Sociopathy is not necessarily a mental illness at all, more like a neurological condition.I'd like to see an fMRI scan of his brain (looking for white-matter connectivity issues associated with sociopathy and psychopathy among other indicators) as well as a genetic test for the presence of the pro-social variant of the oxytocin-receptor gene.Until that data is available, your comment about his brain is just as speculative as mine was (why I included the word "probably" in it). Still, just using his behavior as evidence (and keeping current on research into the neurological aspects of dysfunctional behavior), I'd say the chance is higher that my guess is more likely.</comment>

<comment>Sociopaths do have feelings and emotions, just not towards other people: they sure feel a lot about themselves. I bet that the crying was deeply felt, as he antecipated the colossal amount of rape and vioence he will face in jail.</comment>

<comment>The prevalence of violence and rape in prison is itself criminal and makes our so-called "justice" system morally-equivalent to Holtzclaw.Incidentally, rapists who are sent to prison tend to be the rapists in prison. Granted, most aren't also disgraced cops, but if Holtzclaw is attacked in prison it'll probably be because he was a cop, not because he was a rapist.</comment>

<comment>Satisfying from a sense of justice but still sad for the victims.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. Did he really think he was going to skate on all counts?</comment>

<comment>#1 question: Why wweren't Holtzclaw (and his attorneys) required to stand up like men when verdicts were read? Instead, they sat on their rumps. That's not  court decorum where I'm from.</comment>

<comment>The best part was when he walked out past the side where the supporters of the women who were assaulted were sitting. The looks on their faces in those few seconds — liberating.</comment>

<comment>As if he has the gall to cry. Prick. </comment>

<comment>Well over 200 years is a long time.</comment>

<comment>LMAO!!!!  Happy belated birthday, B!TCH!!  Don't drop the soap!!!!  LOL!!!!</comment>

<comment>The fact that people from all parts of the political spectrum think like this is the reason why, for the foreseeable future, the U.S. will have rates of prison rape that make the rest of the developed world blanch in horror.Most decent people are against prison rape in the abstract, but once someone truly despicable gets convicted, out come the soap jokes.</comment>

<comment>YEP!!  And in this case, justifiably so.</comment>

<comment>Well, I'm normally on about the same page as you politically, but I'm afraid I must draw the line at state-facilitated vengeance rape.</comment>

<comment>Our prisons are horrible. He will be assaulted. It doesn't matter if he is in special custody or not. It will absolutely happen. And it is not the way that I would want prisons to be. This brand new prisoner- who never once considered for a single moment- that maybe he *SHOULD* possibly think about what he was putting his victims through- WILL KNOW EXACTLY what he put his victims through. I'm just one person and I can't do anything about saving HIM from assault. I can't lead him gently to humanity and compassion through counselling. I would prefer that our prisons did this and were successful at rehabilitation. But our prisons are broken and so is he. He still denies that he did anything wrong.I can appreciate that his future experiences might offer him some knowledge that he made the choice to ignore.Sorry, but we all got to have some hope from somewhere.</comment>

<comment>No, you despicable, contemptible, thug, it isn't justfied. Once you accept the premise that it is a good thing for a human being, no matter how wretchedly evil, to be tortured, because the state willfully allows it, or even, as is often the case with prison rape, facilitates it, then you are little better than the rapist yourself. You are grotesque.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't say a hypocrite, which every person is at some point in their lives, is only "a little better than the rapist."</comment>

<comment>I would say that a person who applauds his or her government facilitating rape is only a little better than a rapist.</comment>

<comment>Why is it always presumed that the person being shipped off to prison is destined to be the victim of prison rape, rather than a prison rapist?The problem with using prison rape as a measure of justice is that every time a prisoner is being "punished" via rape, the prisoner doing the raping is ostensibly being "rewarded".</comment>

<comment>The rationalization to justify cruel punishment of rapist cops resembles the same one justifying rape of black women with past criminal records.</comment>

<comment>You seem smart. Classy, too.</comment>

<comment>Well, that and PREA is at least as much of a joke as the actual rape jokes.</comment>

<comment>Yes, it is quite disturbing and I find it not much different than the attitudes of the cop that raped women. Wishing rape on someone. Humane punishments and protection for society is good enough for me.</comment>

<comment>Bridge too far Berynice. Bridge too far.After all, look how happy so many people are when the cops gun someone down on the street, with or without reason. The latter ones get my goat tremendously. The former cases still trouble me.</comment>

<comment>I'm afraid in my bubble nobody's happy about it. I don't even know what bridge too far means? But I know when I hear somebody wanting vengeance it doesn't make me feel good or more secure or warm and fuzzy or take away bad things that have happened. Wishing for more bad things doesn't make me feel better.</comment>

<comment>A bridge too far is a bridge that cannot be crossed. It's in reference to your satisfaction with humane punishments and protection for society which isn't enough for most. Vengeance is a necessary component for a whole lot of people.It's nice to see a decent human being in the comboxes. It's a rarity.</comment>

<comment>Indeed. People see it as bringing some sort of balance, that it makes the score Rape 1: Society 1.It doesn't. It just makes it Rape 2: Society 0.</comment>

<comment>Prison rape is the great equalizer.....saving us from our horrible 'justice' system that is for whites only.  Once in a while one of the dominant culture pigs get real justice.  This is one of those times.  Bravo.  Hope his sphincter becomes unable to hold it's contents and that he ends up with a colostomy from all the a(ss)buse.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure that your bestial emotional gratification justifies the literally thousands of people raped in prison who are non-white, and who didn't commit heinous crimes.I'd rather let the right-wingers keep their lock on medieval notions of retributive justice, thanks!</comment>

<comment>to each their own, but sometimes poetic justice is it's own reward</comment>

<comment>Just as long as you understand that you are advocating rape and vengeance as a means of justice.</comment>

<comment>Tell me he doesn't deserve it,</comment>

<comment>Nobody deserves to be the victim of state-facilitated rape, sorry.</comment>

<comment>Actually, I think I'm going for the old fashioned an eye for an eye scenario when it comes to this type of crime in general. What I'd really like is the gift of chaining him to a wall in a locked room with those women and their families for about 8 hours....in the abscense of that prison retribution will do just fine.  Let the karmic wheel turn for this animal. I'm guessing that every one of those women would just love cutting his dick off.  That's justice.</comment>

<comment>One slice at a time, so all would get in their licks, so to speak.</comment>

<comment>Said every woman who has ever been raped including myself....but it IS supported and accepted as long as it is pointed at women.</comment>

<comment>Admittedly, the logical, civilized side of me says that an eye for an eye is old-testament barbaric, we should turn the other cheek, society is judged on how we treat our worst offenders, blah, blah, we are better than our nature, blah.But if I'm gonna be real 'bout it? He deserves it for being a despicable piece of s*** predator who preyed on the weakest and never expected to get caught, let alone convicted. Good riddance to him.</comment>

<comment>Yes ... he figured even if caught, he'd be given a warning, and told to be more careful in the future.</comment>

<comment>NT</comment>

<comment>Rape just isn't funny.  Nor should it be considered a just punishment for any crime.  Just because criminals are barbaric doesn't mean the rest of us should be barbaric in return.This wretch is likely to spend the rest of his days in prison.  Prison sucks enough without rape.</comment>

<comment>Here comes protective management...</comment>

<comment>They really ought to stop putting these people in protective custody. I think the justice system could save a lot of money by teaching the inmates about these SOB's and letting them in the gen pop. Most of them wouldn't survive, the rest would wish they hadn't.</comment>

<comment>It probably wouldn't save money having to constantly investigate the deaths of the inmates. And, depending on the state, there's not a huge amount of difference in how much PM costs. You're talking about a handful of additional officers, basically. Again...that varies from state to state.</comment>

<comment>I'm just raging. I didn't think it through. But tell me aren't you angry at the sheer amount of rapists and murders that virtually get away with it because their locked away in protective custody?</comment>

<comment>"But tell me aren't you angry at the sheer amount of rapists and murders that virtually get away with it because their locked away in protective custody?"I don't agree with your premise, so I can't really respond beyond that. There's a HUGE degree of difference between life in prison and getting away with something, virtually or otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Cops get protected custody.  Run-or-the-mill rapists and murderers don't.</comment>

<comment>What you are suggesting is breaking of the law and extrajudicial punishment in response to people being convicted of crimes.  That is a sick thing to believe in.Every single person, regardless of their crime, should serve their terms of confinement in safety, period.  Also, we need to do a much better job of rehabilitation of the incarcerated population.  We spend more money than anyone else on incarceration, have the largest prison population and do an incredibly poor job preventing recidivism.  This is one of the things that point to what a failure the US is compared to other developed countries.Have a great day!</comment>

<comment>Any person who sincerely believes such things is nothing better than him. But since people write a lot of stupid stuff on the internet without actually meaning it I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. But I am still disgusted by your comment.</comment>

<comment>He is crying because he knows he will be biting a lot of pillows in the near future.</comment>

<comment>who allegedly raped and sexually assaulted at least 13 black womenWhat the hell do you mean ALLEGEDLY? Look at your own headline, GUILTY. No more alleged.</comment>

<comment>He wasn't convicted of all of the rape and assault charges. 18 out of the 36.  He was found guilty for some victims, not guilty for others. But, if you wanted to convey the scope of his crimes, you want to mention how many victims brought charges. But you can't say he was found guilty of sexually assaulting all 13 women because he wasn't convicted on all counts. Allegedly makes the statement legally accurate.</comment>

<comment>Don't think so.</comment>

<comment>Life in prison is the only fitting punishment.</comment>

<comment>263 years is longer than anyone's life.</comment>

<comment>This is a totally despicable crime, the abuse of power, preying on the people who are poor and combining it with sexual abuse and hiding behind a badge. He doesn't need to be in jail he needs to be beneath the jail.It's also an assault on democracy. If we can't trust law enforcement officers to respect and uphold the law, who can we trust?</comment>

<comment>Perhaps the broad communities of USA citizens will begin to recognize too many police departments have too many issues, and  must began to demand better. The behavior of this individual is far pass sick or perversion, and it seems unlikely that the employing department was unaware of this individual.</comment>

<comment>The "thin blue line" of "protecting our own" must be dealt with.If a civilian hid evidence or covered up a crime, they could easily be convicted. It is a crime to do so. Little progress will be made until police are hld to the same standards.</comment>

<comment>Did that happen in this case?  I haven't seen any mention of the police response not being immediate and adequate to the allegation</comment>

<comment>Sounds like a perfect VP for Hillary. She overlooked rape before.</comment>

<comment>You are a worthless fking douchebag. Lewinski was not raped and you know it. She was a woman obsessed with a president. That is consent you fktard. Now drop fking dead.</comment>

<comment>Are you crazy! he was referring to Juanita Broaderick and Eileen Wellstone women Bill raped.</comment>

<comment>Seriously? Bill Clinton has been accused of sexual harassment by at least a dozen women, and rape by at least two.</comment>

<comment>The fact people don't know that is infuriating. Hillary should be disqualified by today's standards. Clinton is more guilty than Cosby.</comment>

<comment>Oh well.</comment>

<comment>Get over it. It doesn't affect your life & the women have obviously moved on.</comment>

<comment>Not if Hillary is running for President.</comment>

<comment>Hillary should be disqualified because of her husband's actions?</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. She is only there as his wife and HE will be the first Husband.</comment>

<comment>No, but she should be seen as the cynical shit she is, for orchestrating and managing the sliming of his victims.  They are as credible as any of Cosby's victims.  They were raped, assaulted or harassed, and Hillary *enjoyed* deciding whether to slime them as gold diggers, GOP plants or crazy people.  She ruined their reputations AND careers after her partner assaulted them.  She coined the very phrase "Bimbo Eruptions," a phrase itself which shows disdain for women.</comment>

<comment>I don't know if he's "more guilty" than Cosby in terms of the actual assaults and harassment he's guilty of, but he's certainly "as guilty."  Billy Boy's victims are surely as credible as Cosby's.   </comment>

<comment>A nurse is more credible than a Hollywood starlet every day of the week. Many of Cosby's accusers are convicted prostitutes.</comment>

<comment>Go there is you'd like, Rick, but I won't.  I believe Cosby's accusers are very believeable and I don't care if they're "starlets" or convicted prostitutes.In other words, I won't go Clinton on Cosby's victims.</comment>

<comment>To be more clear I think Cosby is innocent and Clinton is a serial rapist. Hollywood starlets are known liars.</comment>

<comment>I think both are guilty. I like Cosby and am sad about that.  I understand he hasn't been convicted in a court of law, but he's got too many credible accusations against him by too many women who don't know each other from Adam, coming out independently about the very same kind of incident.Clinton is scum, too.  In addition to his harassment, rape and assaults he slimes his victims and has ruined them with the help of Hillary.</comment>

<comment>We agree on Clinton. You might be right on Cosby.</comment>

<comment>To be clear, you have no thinking ability whatsoever.</comment>

<comment>No, many of Cosby's accusers are accomplished women who don't need his money but want to see the old sleaze get a dose of justice.</comment>

<comment>They are all lying groupies accept for the case he settled. I believe that women.</comment>

<comment>Hope old rapist CosbyI is being made aware of Claw's fate.</comment>

<comment>I don't know how old you are, but there was a loooooong investigation into this.Those claims couldn't be corroborated by evidence.  We know that not all claims are supported by the facts.  That you're just throwing them around speaks volumes about you.</comment>

<comment>Then why did he pay them off?</comment>

<comment>Nor can the charges against Bill Cosby be "corroborated by evidence."  Do we disbelieve the women coming out against him, who had no previous knowledge or relationship with one another, who describe nearly identical assaults?Well, that's exactly what the long line of women who Billy Boy assaulted were.  Almost all of them were somehow related to his governorship, or campaign or the Democratic Party.  They were on his side, not GOP plants."...couldn't be corroborated by evidence" is the entire story of the Clintons in a nutshell, isn't it?  It reminds me of Billy Murray in "Stripes" when the recruiter asks if he's ever been convicted of a crime.  He pauses and answers, "Convicted?  No."</comment>

<comment>We try not to feed the trolls.</comment>

<comment>well, we TRY not to</comment>

<comment>Bubba has a long history. Good thing his pecker no longer works.</comment>

<comment>Oh please.  As if Bill Clinton's repulsive sexual history started and ended with poor Monica Lewinsky.Bill Clinton was serial sexual assaulter and harasser, well prior to Lewinsky.  His sexual history is despicable.  There are at least a dozen women, with zero prior knowledge or relationship to one another, who were pro-Clinton, pro-his governorship at the time of their assaults - NOT Republican plants - all with very credible claims of assault and/or harassment by him.  The charges they brought against him are as credible as the charges brought against Bill Cosby.Worse, they had their reputations and careers ruined when they came forward.  And who led the campaign against the endless "bimbo eruptions"?  Hillary "I'm a Feminist Icon" Fukcing Clinton.  It was her own special duty to decide whether to slime his victims as gold diggers or nutjobs.  She invented the very term "bimbo eruption."  A regular Gloria Steinem she is.The ONLY way someone can dismiss these charges is out of reflexive partisanship.  If Golden Billy was a Republican who was discovered to have been such an abuser of women, the left would have ended his career, and rightly so.As for Lewinsky, I'd have far more respect for Billy Boy if he had had a genuine affair, a relationship with a woman who he showed some respect for.  Instead he used an adoring, immature young woman who was starry-eyed about giving blowjobs to the President of the United States.  Without the "blue dress" he and Hillary would have savaged her as well.What shameless, rotten human beings these Clintons are.  That they have sold so many Americans on them being some kind of icons of progressivism makes me want to vomit.</comment>

<comment>for the record, when the trolling is THIS transparent and frequent (i'm almost impressed by how many bad one-liners you've coughed up in only 4 days), people learn to ignore you pretty quickly.  step up your game.</comment>

<comment>happy birthday scumbag</comment>

<comment>And go Flyers.</comment>

<comment>Sixers cancel out the Flyers.</comment>

<comment>"Sixers cancel out the Flyers."Ohhh! That was low. (Eagles also).</comment>

<comment>Finally, a pervert cop gets caught.</comment>

<comment>Now if only so many of those other killer cops get the life sentences they so richly deserve.</comment>

<comment>Matt Ford: He was found guilty, therefore you have no need to say he "allegedly raped" the women. He actually raped the women.</comment>

<comment>Exactly.</comment>

<comment>I was going to say the same thing. I thought that, in journalism, "alleged" only has to be used to the point of conviction.</comment>

<comment>On modern journalism, throwing in the word "alleged" is reduced to the level of a verbal tic.  It originated as a self-defense measure against defamation litigation, and ended up being tossed in as the written equivalent of saying "um" or "uh".</comment>

<comment>When it's a white person accused of a crime, they say "allegedly."  When a non-white person is accused of a crime, they have him tried and convicted long before he ever enters a courtroom.  it's just how it is.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, the cop was accused by 13 women, but not convicted of raping all of them.  Hence, the use of "allegedly" in that sentence.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps; I see your point. In reading the article it seems the women went through a lot of victim shaming, and it just burned a bit to see the word "allegedly" used.</comment>

<comment>Don't do the crime - and you won't have to do the time. Glad he was convicted. Sounds like he'll be right where he needs to be. Justice served.</comment>

<comment>That's right. Cry you slimy piece of crap. Enjoy the rest of your shitty life in prison.</comment>

<comment>Yes. We definitely need more prison rape jokes.</comment>

<comment>the reporting on this trial has been very poor. does anyone have any links where they talk about the evidence submitted in the case? the media makes it seems as though the testimony of the victims was the only evidence.</comment>

<comment>The info is in one of the links from this story.</comment>

<comment>It's very likely that the percentage of rapists and child molesters on police forces is much higher than the general population </comment>

<comment>Derived from what info?  One conviction</comment>

<comment>Having grown up around a lot of cops.  Most are just awful people </comment>

<comment>Exchange cop for race and you would be chided.  Stop stereotyping</comment>

<comment>That's really stupid. Cops are free to quit anytime </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>solid source. thanks.</comment>

<comment>Hope he enjoys the rest of his life in solitary!  </comment>

<comment>What I don't understand--as a heterosexual man, what I don't understand--is how a guy can attain an erection, much less an orgasm, if a woman does not want him to do so? If she does not give her free consent? I don't understand how that works. How does a mind arrive at that juncture? And every man knows that erection and orgasm first happen in the mind before they happen in the body.</comment>

<comment>It's not the sex, but the power</comment>

<comment>I realize it's about power. But is there not a basic moral prohibition against such a use of power? It's not something I have to look for--it's inside, inherent. Or is it taught, and in some cases not taught, or taught and forgotten? To me, morality is an absolute truth. I don't need a state legislature's law against rape to prevent my body from raping.</comment>

<comment>It's because you view the act as a consensual interaction between two people. Rapists view the act as a conquering, even if the other party is willing.</comment>

<comment>This. You're (thankfully) not a sociopath and fully understand the concept and practice of consent. For rapists, it's about having power over the victim, destroying their ability to consent and deriving pleasure from their position of supposed superiority.</comment>

<comment>To you, morality may be an absolute truth but not to rapists.  Rapists don't have any basic moral prohibitions whatsoever.  It's like I want it so I'm going to take it.</comment>

<comment>"To me, morality is an absolute truth."Me too. Now tell it to our politicians.</comment>

<comment>'To me, morality is an absolute truth.'For that to be true wouldn't it have to be for everyone?</comment>

<comment>I'm sure every woman who comes across your comment will be very impressed.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps. But I don't need her to be impressed. I need to impress myself. How can a rapist have any self-esteem? What kind of identity does he have? He's nothing. A hole in the ground is more self-actualized.</comment>

<comment>His self-esteem lies in his ability to dominate and control.  Rape isn't about sex, it's all about power.  "Hey lookit me, I f*cked that b*tch and there was nothing she could do about it."  That's the mindset of a rapist.  Most normal people can't begin to fathom it.</comment>

<comment>There's a lot of space between a rapist and a panderer.</comment>

<comment>One of these days you will impress a women.</comment>

<comment>Why would I want to impress you?</comment>

<comment>Looks like you have never met a real man.</comment>

<comment>Despite conversing with you.</comment>

<comment>You have your own answer... you NAME.</comment>

<comment>Here is a good article about the sexual arousal of rapists:http://www.nytimes.com/1991/12...</comment>

<comment>I'm glad you don't understand.  The bottom line is that it's about power and control.  Someone else's feelings have little to do with it.</comment>

<comment>Hi Willie. Good to see you.</comment>

<comment>I see what you did there</comment>

<comment>Maybe the fact that his last name sounds like a James Bond villain should have tipped everyone off that he was up to no good.</comment>

<comment>Wood clawwwwww.... he's the man, the man with the wooooden claw!</comment>

<comment>I never Metaluna I didn't like.</comment>

<comment>So nice to know he'll  get the frequent and very long term ass brutilization that he deserves.  He knows what happens to rapists in prison.  That's why he's crying.  Sentenced on his birthday.  Poetic Justice has been served.</comment>

<comment>Nope.  Ex cops get put in segregation units.</comment>

<comment>I don't think that'll keep him safe....prison has it own way of metting out justice through it's own social culture.</comment>

<comment>Except he'll be around prisoners that are either a) in for similar crimes or b) also used to be in positions of legal power. He'll stay safe, most likely.</comment>

<comment>Doubtful, I've worked in prisons....the subculture within those walls will take care of him and it will never come to the light of day....just as he thought his crimes wouldn't.  So perfect.</comment>

<comment>I have also worked in prisons. I'll grant that it might be different in Oklahoma, but in Florida they'd have at least a difficult time getting to him. I'd actually argue that he's in more trouble because he's a former cop. Doesn't mean he won't suffer the hell of perpetually looking over his shoulder, of course.</comment>

<comment>Well, a girl can dare to dream....</comment>

<comment>Heh. Fair.</comment>

<comment>A segregation unit won't protect this germ.  He won't last a year inside.</comment>

<comment>I'd be surprised if you were correct, actually.</comment>

<comment>"Holtzclaw sobbed and rocked in his chair"Ha ha. GOOD.</comment>

<comment>Given the recent trends and even sadder to think it is he'd probably walked free if he shot and killed each of his victims.</comment>

<comment>He'd probably have a ton of defenders on here</comment>

<comment>lol...probably. Look at you, being all optimistic.</comment>

<comment>haha, I know, definitely is more realistic.</comment>

<comment>I can think of a couple of conspicuously absent names...</comment>

<comment>Yes, that was satisfying to hear.</comment>

<comment>"Holtzclaw sobbed and rocked in his chair"May that be only the beginning of a life of sobbing.</comment>

<comment>Why is it that this sentence used in the article "who allegedly raped and sexually assaulted" if he was found guilty by the courts? He is a rapist and was found guilty of raping women. Let us call a spade a spade!!!</comment>

<comment>From what I'm seeing here, if we really want to cast aside our political differences and come together as a nation, we should just start telling prison rape jokes.</comment>

<comment>Justice served - what a despicable crime committed against those he was supposed to protect.</comment>

<comment>The writer said allegedly.   He was convicted you idiot .  He said allegedly and convicted in the same sentence .  Retard.</comment>

<comment>Heh. Mike Tyson commenting on a piece about a rape trial.</comment>

<comment>Kobe agrees with y'all.</comment>

<comment> Careful or you'll lose an ear...</comment>

<comment>Probably just a journalist's habit.</comment>

<comment>I think as others pointed out he wasn't convicted of all counts so the scope of the crimes is still allegedly 13 women. So is there a high likelihood he raped 13 women? Absolutely? Has that been legally established as to all of them? No. </comment>

<comment>As an aside here, those making prison rape jokes - you should be ashamed of yourselves.  Rape is US prisons is a national disgrace.  If we as a society are going to sentence people to rape, it ought to be done explicitly by judges and with the knowledge and approval of the voting population as it is for the death penalty.  If we are going to do that, then we ought to take this to its logical conclusion and sanction torture as a punishment.  None of this intended as sympathy for the convicted, but just listen to yourself when you say these things.</comment>

<comment>Jim Webb spoke out on this topic, but no one cared.</comment>

<comment>I would vote to have him raped daily, with a cactus or pineapple </comment>

<comment>Good. It sounds like that conviction was the only sensible outcome. Now can him up for a good long while and maybe he'll come out the other side knowing better than to engage in such vile criminal activities again.</comment>

<comment>Unless he's given parole, sounds like he's never coming out the other side.</comment>

<comment>Finally...something everyone can agree on.This guy deserves everything that's coming to him.</comment>

<comment>Hello?  Why would this man go crazy if he knew what he was doing?  This is definitely the age of entitlement isn't it?</comment>

<comment>A small victory in the war against Police corruption to be sure, but a victory none the less.</comment>

<comment>Most excellent.  Such crimes committed under the cover of the badge are not only crimes against the individual victims, but all of us.</comment>

<comment>White racist should be deported...</comment>

<comment>Nothing like committing crimes when you're supposed to be the person who polices them. What a damn piece of shiiiittt.  I don't care who you rape.  Rape is rape. So, if a woman says NO, guys -- she means NO and, if you proceed otherwise, this could be you.</comment>

<comment>A predator preying on the vulnerable, people at the margins of society, and thinking he'd never get caught. Sociopath.</comment>

<comment>That is why I always say that Cops committing crimes should get tougher sentences than the general population - the violation of trust and the fact they are well aware of the consequences of their crime should double their sentences and obliterate any good points from their  past work record.</comment>

<comment>GOOD. May he rot in prison.</comment>

<comment>Was there any evidence besides the victims' testimony?</comment>

<comment>Yes. There was physical evidence, including DNA.</comment>

<comment>OK.</comment>

<comment>Tons of it.  This cop isn't very bright.</comment>

<comment>Now where are all those republicans who kept saying all you have to do is obey the cop and you won't get hurt?</comment>

<comment>Is Cheyenne  your poll dancing name?</comment>

<comment>Is Jiffy Pop the name you use when you're doing business on the corner?  "Hey, this won't take more than a jiffy, two bucks please."P.S.  Try to learn the difference between poll and pole.  Your ignorance  is mind-boggling,</comment>

<comment>I use the name Jiffy Pop when putting dollar bills in your G-string.</comment>

<comment>I bet that's the only way any girl let's you near here g-string, loser.  You don't even know the difference between pole and poll. What a nitwit </comment>

<comment>OMG you sad little gollum, was that nugget the best you could squeeze out of your butt after all that effort?   What a pathetic little worm you are.</comment>

<comment>a serial killer or serial rapist or secret triad member has nothing to do with the law enforcement agency that employs them - there was NO coverup - the cops are the ones who investigated and caught him.</comment>

<comment>CRY motherfucker. Ugh disgusting.</comment>

<comment>Adebisi awaits.Somewhere in heaven, Walter Dempsey Junior and the Comfort Gays and the Comfort Women are thanking the jurors.</comment>

<comment>For those people out there who question why someone / anyone has or would have mistrust of their community LEOs, we need only to point to cases like this where an officer not only abuses his position of power over the already disenfranchised, but operates as a serial rapist and sexual predator for years knowing that the badge and thin blue line were there to protect him.</comment>

<comment>This specific case completely contradicts your claim.  This monster was not protected by police.   And I wonder why I never heard of this case before today?The police department fired him within a few months after the first woman came forward. They investigated thoroughly and matched the pattern with other cases resulting in him being charged with 36 counts. Now an all white jury has found him guilty on 18 of those counts and he will no doubt be sentenced consecutively resulting in life with no chance of parole.The justice system is operating quite nicely In OK City.  Not so well in Chicago.</comment>

<comment>Dave,This case doesn't contradict my claim that the marginalized are can have a legitimate mistrust of police departments to protect and serve. That the cop operated in such a brazen matter for some time before a woman was able to muster the bravery to come forward says something about the intimidation and mistrust factor. That Holtzclaw was actually charged and convicted doesn't dispute or contradict that police officers can and do abuse their positions and many get away with it.This particular case is one where the justice system actually "worked" for the marginalized victims. But how many more aren't prosecuted because LEOs don't want to take seriously the allegations of a prostitute or drug addict or homeless person? The supporting evidence has to be very strong to convict on rape.I'm not sure why you never heard of this case until today. But maybe it is probably because like many people, we subconsciously screen out news stories that don't necessarily interest us. Not sure what your point is about an all-white jury convicting an officer has to do with the overarching issue of people having mis-trust of the justice system or LEOs.</comment>

<comment>I am not marginalized in the slightest but I don't particularly trust police.   My experience with police attitudes are that they primarily depend upon whether you are calling for assistance or you are under suspicion.  They tend to look at you as either supplicant or possible antagonist.I am just saying that this specific case where the system worked so well is not the case you want to 'point' to as an example of systemic abuse and law enforcement coverup as it was emphatically neither of those things.  It was a uniquely monstrous cop that was quickly weeded out.  You can't really use it to make broad assumptions.   Some other cases are clearly better suited for that.</comment>

<comment>I think there's a fair counterpoint that he went on for a pretty long while and did an impressive amount of damage before the courage of a victim, not any particular initiative by "the system" allowed him to be caught. If he had been more fresh-faced or slightly sneakier, it's very likely no one would have ever troubled him about these crimes.The fact that we're falling on our knees in gratitude that this most horrible of horribles was finally put away does not belie systemic problems in the slightest. This is almost literally the ONLY thing we can catch: monstrously prolific abusers too stupid to cover their tracks. And we were just barely able to do it. Shame on us.</comment>

<comment>It had nothing to do with being a cop but being a rapist hiding inside PD.The jury should have been all white, all male and all PD and they would have gotten to a guilty verdict in minutes.</comment>

<comment>He must be shedding TEARS OF JOY because theres going to be a lot of raping and forcible sodomy where hes going....Oh wait... Who'm I kidding?He's a cop.He'll get an ankle bracelet.  </comment>

<comment>No, he won't.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't feel like a cop to me at all.And as the song goes "tears don't care who cry them."Tears don't care who cries them, they don't care at allAny time a heart starts breaking, they will fall and fallRich man, poor man, beggar, tears can fill each eyeThey don't care who cries them, you just cry, cry, cryRead more:  K.

<comment>She should tour China - the Mainlanders would love these songs.Or maybe just Tibet - she can collaborate with Han Hong.</comment>

<comment>My son was framed, he has always been a good boy.  - Mom</comment>

<comment>The man is as guilty as sin, that being said we had a saying around my parts, something to the effect, I'd rather take a beat down by the police then a collar, especially if our Dad's would find out. I have no doubt MANY young ladies would rather do sexual stuff then go to jail.</comment>
