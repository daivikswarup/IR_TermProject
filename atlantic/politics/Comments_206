<comment>I do. </comment>

<comment>Poor Jeb(!). Doesn't your heart just go out to him.</comment>

<comment>Why?  He just won the Hillary 2008 coronation crown.</comment>

<comment>I know. Some days, it hardly seems worth the effort of trying to buy the presidency at all.</comment>

<comment>The man needs to unleash a little Chiang.</comment>

<comment>The first of the anti-Iran pandering has begun. Let's forget that those sailors have already been released and are already back on base.</comment>

<comment>haha. Cruz doesn't want "anyone on their knees".Were those sailors even captured during the SOTU?</comment>

<comment>They were captured (detained really) a little prior to it. But rather than make fuss over it, they did the right thing and were vindicated when they were released in under 24 hours with all their equipment.</comment>

<comment>prior to our opening up relations with Iran this episode would've dragged on for weeks</comment>

<comment>They only wanted nothing standing in their way of $150B. They would never have tried this with another leader - like a Reagan. They enjoy taunting us.</comment>

<comment>They admitted they drifted into Iran's territory due to engine failure. They were released unharmed in less then a day. Nice try, though.</comment>

<comment>In a submissive embarrassing way. Nice try, though. </comment>

<comment>Regan who cut and ran from Lebanon after the embassy bombing?oh yeah sure</comment>

<comment>That's all you can bring up about Reagan. The Best!</comment>

<comment>Wel you said Reagan would've stood up to them.   I gave a prime example of him cutting and running</comment>

<comment>Ok I guess I was thinking of the talk softly, carry a big stick Reagan. By building up the military, he was able to demand some things without having to battle much. Also the air traffic controllers firing and Iran hostage release gave him future respect. </comment>

<comment>The day before, but they admitted they drifted into Iranian waters when their engine failed.</comment>

<comment>Thou shalt chest thump.</comment>

<comment>Hey, they paid good money to somebody to write those talking points for them, and by golly, they're going to use them - relevance be damned!</comment>

<comment>And under President Cruz, Tehran would be a smoldering ruins right now....unless he's lying.</comment>

<comment>The panderers are the same people that told us for years how well things were going in Iraq.  It's a testament to our love for freedom that these mentally insane people are not committed to an institution.</comment>

<comment>Not mentioned, even in passing, was the humiliation inflicted on GWB when one of our spy planes was forced to make an emergency landing in China. That incident dragged on for days, with American airmen held prisoner, during what was allegedly the golden zenith of America's power and respect around the world.How odd.</comment>

<comment>"job creators"... uh huh</comment>

<comment>Ah! I am worried, Chris! Help!!</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie is such a despicable scumbag. Even for right wing pols, he carves out a new benchmark for scumbag.</comment>

<comment>Wow. What did he say to make your idiocy spew?</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie is the least right wing politician in this primary.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/...http://fivethirtyeight.com/dat...</comment>

<comment>He is, but he's still a stark raving a-hole.</comment>

<comment>""Protect American interests" is such a vague phrase, it can mean anything. Get a room of foreign policy wonks together and they'll argue all day what qualifies as an "interest".</comment>

<comment>It's right up there with "keep America strong" and "protect our families" as a feel-good phrase that can mean whatever the politician in question wants it to mean.</comment>

<comment>Pretty much. None of them seem willing to mention any details, except that it's all Obama's fault.</comment>

<comment>That one means that they will start new wars</comment>

<comment>Lots of them.  Awesome.</comment>

<comment>Good that you confess</comment>

<comment>Yah, I am a sleazeball.  Don't forget it.</comment>

<comment>More importantly, it can mean whatever his supporters want it to mean.</comment>

<comment>It sure can. People often project whatever they hope for  onto a candidate who deliberately keeps things vague.</comment>

<comment>First you have to "take back America," and then you can get around to protecting its interests.</comment>

<comment>That one means American oligarchy get back a lot more cash</comment>

<comment>It means that they want install  new corrupt dictators in their pocket</comment>

<comment>Poor Jeb(!). I am not enjoying his sad decline. (though of course he would be a horror show as President). He is a deer-in-the-headlights candidateHey Jeb(!) scored one with "white house to the courthouse"</comment>

<comment>And that pained, sad little head-tilty smile....</comment>

<comment>And shoulder-shrug thing that runs in the family. What the hell?</comment>

<comment>Yeah – that sad, head-titly thing. ew...</comment>

<comment>Dodd Frank is now a national security thing....</comment>

<comment>Benghazi conspiracy theories. Everyone drink.</comment>

<comment>The email scandal is so much more compelling thanks to the data the FBI recovered and the FOIA requests and the State Department getting it out to the public.  My favorite so far is her reply to aide Jake Sullivan about a problem with getting her some information via the secure fax:"If they can’t, turn into nonpaper w no identifying heading and send nonsecure"If that turned out to be classified and he did what she asked, she's cooked.http://thehill.com/blogs/ballo...</comment>

<comment>Rubio comes out swinging.... BENGHAZI!!!(Can I get a drink of water?)</comment>

<comment>These men are all KKK/neo-Nazis and I hate them all! I'm so glad they have no chance of winning the general election.</comment>

<comment>Another compassionate liberal heard from .</comment>

<comment>I miss Rand Paul; no one to remind Rubio that his military adventurism costs trillions. Go deficit!</comment>

<comment>It's great when Rand Paul calls the GOP out on its military adventurism.</comment>

<comment>"Exo-atmosphere..." Whaa?</comment>

<comment>It seems this debate is going to be mostly foreign policy. Watching Carson show how little he understands about warfare is rather sad. EMPs, dirty bombs. It's like a survivalist website's fiction blog.</comment>

<comment>Dude needs to stick to brain surgery. Foreign policy and warfare is not his forte.</comment>

<comment>Are you ignorant of the effects of a high altitude nuclear detonation on electronics?  A high atmosphere nuclear test in the Pacific knocked out power in Hawaii over 750 miles away.</comment>

<comment>Go Bernman and Trumpster Fire! Change we need!</comment>

<comment>Of course.</comment>

<comment>Do you ever make any comments that are longer than one sentence and aren't name calling or mindless partisan statements?</comment>

<comment>So when is the first presidential debate and will Gary Johnson be invited?</comment>

<comment>Hillary is on MSNBC yet the lefty losers would rather watch the debate and spew their hate and vile remarks on here . How revealing.</comment>

<comment>In the end votes are counted, not the number of polls that one is on the top of.  This isn't the TV ratings game.  Votes are the only things that count.</comment>

<comment>Why does Cruz hate the Constitution?</comment>

<comment>Cruz has a beak!!!  LOL!!!  Bird man!!</comment>

<comment>The crowd doesn't know what to boo or cheer</comment>

<comment>Probably not a collection of the greatest minds in America.</comment>

<comment>That's a given.</comment>

<comment>Definitely not</comment>

<comment>Take it from your own prof</comment>

<comment>this debate is an embarrassment so far...</comment>

<comment>The repuke party is an embarrassment </comment>

<comment>This is embarrassing for everyone in this country.</comment>

<comment>How long do ya'll think these debate formats will last? Two or three more Presidential primary cycles?Make sure to take into consideration that these networks like CNN, MSNBC, and Fox are on lifelines from so many people cutting their cable. (I know that these debates have generated enormous ratings, I think I may have already answered the question. Ha!)Rand Paul is on periscope answering questions. What do ya'll think the future format of these debates will look like? In my opinion, I'd like to see small debates of three or four max on separate nights with separate issues.</comment>

<comment>I like the idea. The crowded stage doesn't help. Too bad for Paul, I guess all of the money bombs have been defused.</comment>

<comment>It is amazing to me just how paranoid and xenophobic these sad candidates are.Cruz talking about Lawrence Tribe with " dog whistle....dog whistle"And little boy Rubio pipes in with "me..me..me"</comment>

<comment>Ok Fido.</comment>

<comment>Gophukurself </comment>

<comment>Watch out. This site is apparently banning people who are rude to the troll infestation crowd. It won't ban them, but apparently you can be banned for being rude to them back.</comment>

<comment>Seriously? Who got banned?</comment>

<comment>Naidm. Which I expect people already figured out is me, since I didn't attempt to change my speech patterns. I thought maybe they'd finally cleaned up the site, but I see limoman and some of the other very virulent trolls are still posting, so clearly it was just me.Apparently being a neo-Nazi posting hate speech is not a bannable offense. Cursing at neo-Nazis is. </comment>

<comment>Maybe you calling everyone a nazi a bigot and a racist might have had something to do with that?</comment>

<comment>Accurately identifying what you and your compatriots are is not inappropriate.</comment>

<comment>Oh, geez. I wish they'd get rid of some of the obvious racists, personally.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I don't really understand the logic. If they read me cursing at them, they must have read the racist comments, right?</comment>

<comment>One would think, yes.</comment>

<comment>I'm losing a lot of faith in this site. I like the liveblogs for these debates, they're usually okay. But honestly I can't figure out how they are so unwilling to do anything about the troll infestation. I know it's been brought to their attention.</comment>

<comment>Phuck 'em, republicans suck</comment>

<comment>You know, it's difficult to take anything you say seriously after thinking what's been in that big filthy mouth of yours.</comment>

<comment>Comment from CNN's live blog that is worth sharing: "Donald, if you make Cruz your VP candidate, hire a food taster!"</comment>

<comment>Poor Jeb(!). The whine in his voice is listed on the stock exchange.And Carson is sleeping his way through yet another "debate"</comment>

<comment>I finally figured it out.  You're actually Joan Rivers, minus the humor.  It makes perfect sense, too bad it doesn't actually advance the discourse any because there aren't too many ways to respond to mean spirited attacks that don't even pretend to raise a point worth discussing.</comment>

<comment>"Because you know, zzzzzzzzzz..... if a progressive zzzzzzzzzz .... we'd better zzzzzzzzzzzz." -- Carson</comment>

<comment>Just when i thought Kasich was the smart one.</comment>

<comment>Race to bottom.</comment>

<comment>"Until 1988, the debates were overseen by the League of Women Voters, a group Farah says was much better at putting the voters' priorities over the candidates in the debates, and not excluding third party candidates......By 1988, however, the League decided it would pull out of sponsoring the presidential debates, saying the campaigns had negotiated "behind closed doors" in a way that had given them too much control over the debate proceedings, questioners and audience. The League released a strongly worded statement at the time that read:"It has become clear to us that the candidates' organizations aim to add debates to their list of campaign-trail charades devoid of substance, spontaneity and answers to tough questions. The League has no intention of becoming an accessory to the hoodwinking of the American public."</comment>

<comment>Wow, I thought Rubio had gotten over on Christie, but then bam, Christie swatted right back. Impressive.</comment>

<comment>Interested to see the fact checks on that.</comment>

<comment>"Self-avowed socialist"Hey – back to the future. It is 1950 again and Americans are stupid sheep, cowed by bullies like Joe McCarthy (or now, Ted Cruz and Donald Trump).Are Americans this stupid?</comment>

<comment>Short answer , yes!</comment>

<comment>Many are, yes. In fact, half are below average. </comment>

<comment>(half are below median)</comment>

<comment>Technically, yes. However, one of the neat characteristics of a normal distribution is that the median and the mean are equal. Given the population size, one can safely assume a normal distribution here, or are you under the impression that the distribution has skewed recently?</comment>

<comment>You betchya!</comment>

<comment>Lots of them are planning on voting for Sanders so yes they are that stupid</comment>

<comment>Sanders will wipe the floor with any of those clowns on stage.</comment>

<comment>If you can name me some successful socialist Countries, maybe they are.  However I doubt you'll be able to, most of them didn't make it and the ones that did aren't very successful.  I'll spare you some embarrassment and advise that the only one still in existence in Western Europe is Portugal and their debt to GDP ratio is worse than Greece.</comment>

<comment>So you are a follower.That's ok. Nothing to be ashamed of. Not everyone can lead (like me)</comment>

<comment>"We don't hate the rich... we just want to be the rich"the same old Republican lie.Sorry, no. You are not going to "be the rich" given the the right wing political agenda. You are going to be a poor, middle class American in decline.</comment>

<comment>Indicates capacity for independent, rational thought--not a quality appreciated by special interest groups.</comment>

<comment>I'm always impressed by the ability of candidates to speak so many words without any actual substance.</comment>

<comment>This debate is a lamentable waste of my time.</comment>

<comment>Word salad?</comment>

<comment>Indeed, but topped with Ameritude!</comment>

<comment>They have in-service training for that (tax-payer funded)</comment>

<comment>They don't write the script.</comment>

<comment>Do any of you people here have anything relevant about the debate or are you simply satisfied to do snark badly?</comment>

<comment>I can and will gladly add more substance than any of those charlatans on stage have. What topic would you prefer?</comment>

<comment>something other than a drinking game...</comment>

<comment>Why? A drinking game has more value than the empty posturing on stage there. At least you get drunk from the drinking game. These candidates spreading lies and generalizations don't affect the world in any way.</comment>

<comment>If any of them gets elected it will affect the world...</comment>

<comment>They won't. Now where is your substance? All I've seen you do is whine about others not taking this clown show seriously.</comment>

<comment>Is this really a debate, or one big dog whistle?</comment>

<comment>I'm stumped by Carson's brain twister of whether this is still America.  Good one by the Dr.</comment>

<comment>Can you cite a single substantive issue that's been reasonably debated by these asshats?</comment>

<comment>Jeb just discussed gun control...</comment>

<comment>I went to the fridge to grab a beer...missed.  Maybe next debate.</comment>

<comment>Carson complaining about decisiveness is rich, given the general spirit of everyone up there.And then he pins it to "Judao Christian values."Yeah, so glad you are against decisiveness, Ben.</comment>

<comment>Baby Rubio faps about guns....LUBE!!!</comment>

<comment>Wish the moderators would ask these candidates if felons should be allowed to own guns too.  The responses would be hilarious.</comment>

<comment>It is Fox News slow pitch – what do you expect.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is a total prick.</comment>

<comment>Confiscation meme</comment>

<comment>What are we up to now? We got "Obama wants to weaken America", "Obama is a dictator", "Benghazi", "Judeo-Christian roots/values" and now "gun confiscation". We need a big abortion rant for bingo I think.</comment>

<comment>Hmmm....have we raised military spending yet? And background checked and drug tested welfare moms? They can't leave that out...</comment>

<comment>Yeah we had military spending early on. "We can't project force" in Jeb's words.</comment>

<comment>Oh - missed that. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>Can't blame you. I was paying attention then. They were inventing bad foreign policy talking points faster than I could type.I'm about to jump over to the FXX Simpsons all the time marathon, because I'd take 15 year old Simpsons reruns over this.</comment>

<comment>Sigh... Rubio lies againBut I enjoy his saying "...when I am President of the United States..." – like that is going to happen.</comment>

<comment>I think you may be confusing conservatives with Republicans.</comment>

<comment>False.  True Americans WILL NOT quarter any peacetime soldiers without their consent.</comment>

<comment>But I thought conservatives were all a bunch of religious zealous, surely they like the freedom of religion part of the First Amendment, given that is what their lawsuits against gay marriage tend to hinge on.I also thought they hated the government, so you'd think they would also like the 10th Amendment, which states that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, and not prohibited to the states, are reserved for the states.But, I guess if you listed all three of those it would sort of wreck the rhetoric, wouldn't it?  We can't let the truth get in the way of the narrative you want to pitch, do we?</comment>

<comment>Hesitant applause to "petulant child" comment because, clearly, audience unsure what petulant means.</comment>

<comment>It sounded mean, so they clapped.</comment>

<comment>Christie has used that pathetic  "petulant child" line a number of times before. He (or his handlers) think it makes him look "tuff". In fact it makes him look stupid and petty.</comment>

<comment>Now you're just repeating yourself.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie promising to stop a third Obama term.  How brave and courageous!</comment>

<comment>Did you ever play GOW?</comment>

<comment>Sigh. And now Ted Cruz pimps for guns.What color is your dildo, Ted?</comment>

<comment>Sigh....so much word salad, so little dressing.</comment>

<comment>Why won't Obama just listen to the military officials?  They have all the answers for how to solve these problems.  He just needs to ask and implement.</comment>

<comment>When you only have a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.  That's the problem with listening only to the military.  The only response they have is military and that isn't always the best thing to use.</comment>

<comment>Who are Donald's "Muslim friends"?</comment>

<comment>People who work for hate groups like the Gatestone Institute. I think the discredited scam artist Walid Shoebat supports him too. He's an "ex-Muslim". </comment>

<comment>There is a guy who works behind the counter at the corner store down the street who says hello to him and Trump is pretty sure he's Muslim.  Or, you know, Mexican or Italian or whatever.</comment>

<comment>Probably Sikhs</comment>

<comment>He has no friends.Seriously. If you knew Trump's life he is a loner and has no friends. His classmates at Wharton do not even remember him.</comment>

<comment>Yes, he comes off as a total loser desperate for attention.  Not sure why that's not obvious to all.</comment>

<comment>He has a big hotel in Indonesia, the most populous Muslim country on Earth where about 88% of the population belongs to that religion, so I'm sure he spread some money around there and made some Muslim friends.</comment>

<comment>Its PC to be anti racist</comment>

<comment>God damn... has anyone worked with Jeb(!) .. or (Jed!)'His high voice whine reeks of surrender to the GOP goobers.Easy target for Trump. Cruz is a harder target.</comment>

<comment>"This isn't a different kind of job." -- Jeb!Thanks for that insight, Jeb!.</comment>

<comment>I spy... with my little eye.... pipe bombs!!– Donald Trump</comment>

<comment>Lots of people saw pipe bombs, lots.</comment>

<comment>Yeah...lots of people saw seagulls too...</comment>

<comment>Loll </comment>

<comment>Pauvre police</comment>

<comment>Translation: "poor police"</comment>

<comment>Time for the question the candidates if they want to be openly racist or remain implicitly racist portion of the debate.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie... pimping... 9/11 ... is a fcuking onster.</comment>

<comment>Why don't you start a live blog?  Better yet just pre-populate a random insult generator with Republican candidate names, so keywords like terrorism, immigration, 9/11, Iran, and some rude and insulting words and you can sit back and generate equally useless content to the dreck you're pumping out here?</comment>

<comment>Who radicalized Rubio?</comment>

<comment>The polls.</comment>

<comment>Ha – thanks for saving me some typingoh wait...</comment>

<comment>Sad but true</comment>

<comment>LOL Christie's career as prosecutor consisted of going after non-threats and labeling them as terrorists so the government could tell us how safe they were keeping us.</comment>

<comment>He is a baseline scumbag.</comment>

<comment>"Why are you raising this issue now?" Trump: "Because now he's doing a little bit better!"Chris Christie vows to kick President Obama out of the White House—just as his term is ending and he’s leaving voluntarily.Cruz is asked what he means when he accuses Trump of holding New York values. “I think most people know exactly what New York values are,” says Cruz. It’s a remarkable spectacle—a candidate for president implying that being a citizen of its largest city is somehow un-American.There's got to be some vital context I'm missing that makes these statements not as completely idiotic as they sound.</comment>

<comment>There has been so much stupid and so little substance.  Hilarious, as long as you don't think about the office they are running for.</comment>

<comment>Carson wants to use Israeli "screening" techniques. I don't think he's aware of what that actually means.</comment>

<comment>He does. He had extensive discussions with themI;m not sure we can</comment>

<comment>So he wants to adopt openly racist screening and racial profiling, as well as torture?I'm not sure what's worse, being ignorant or willfully endorsing those policies.</comment>

<comment>Do you mean "extensive" discussions?</comment>

<comment>What province?</comment>

<comment>CRUZ IS GOING ELECTRIC....talking about DESTROYING!!!Bubba BubbaBen Carson ...soothing talking about Israel...Jeb....mmmm .... equivocating... whiny voice...</comment>

<comment>"Every problem can be solved with common sense.  What we need to do is convene a group of experts." -- Ben CarsonOkay....</comment>

<comment>Is that one real?  If so, that's an instant classic.</comment>

<comment>Pretty sure that's the gist of it.  Definitely followed up the need for common sense with a call to relying on experts.  Ben's always good for a nonsensical quote when he wakes up from a nap.</comment>

<comment>"China they have total control, just about, of North Korea." -- TrumpThe new definition of total.</comment>

<comment>Trump.... "blah...blah...blah... but I am not saying we would do it.""I have many friends......""....absolutely..."ha ha.It is amazing to me that Americans support this empty sack of shite.</comment>

<comment>"I'm not saying we do it ... I would certainly start taxing goods coming into China." -- TrumpHuh?</comment>

<comment>Ichan is another doochebag </comment>

<comment>Tepid applause, the crowd is clueless when people aren't saying racist xenophobic shyt.</comment>

<comment>Yeah. No doubt "Black people are stealing our jobs" would get a standing ovation.</comment>

<comment>I'm so confused by Trump right now.  He loves free trade, but he wants a tariff.  And he apparently understands China incredibly well, despite not being able to formulate a single coherent thought about the country.</comment>

<comment>I am for flea trade!FLEA TRADE!!- Donald Trump (with add on "me toos" from the other losers)</comment>

<comment>The fleas are gonna be YOOOOOGE!</comment>

<comment>And beautiful </comment>

<comment>The crowd is lost right now</comment>

<comment>Trump's going to put a tariff on China, but it's never going to happen?  Trumponomics is hard to understand outside of Wonderland.</comment>

<comment>Worst crowd ever</comment>

<comment>the pander points are garbled.</comment>

<comment>Poor Jeb.... (!)Jeb is weak ( says Donald). Why is he attacking Jeb when Cruz is the threat?</comment>

<comment>You heard it there, Trump said he likes the poll.</comment>

<comment>But he hates Polish Jews.</comment>

<comment>"I'm not talking about now, I'm talking about the future." -- TrumpWhatcha talkin' 'bout Willis?</comment>

<comment>Cruz is going "tax free"....</comment>

<comment>Even the mods are like, what the phuck are you idiots applauding?</comment>

<comment>What the hell is Cruz babbling about?</comment>

<comment>In fairness, there was some actual substance the last 15 minutes.  Of course, the responses were garbled and incoherent, I have no idea what any of them are actually proposing.  But at least it wasn't just the usual predictable talking points.</comment>

<comment>Somebody say, "Islam" and get the crowd engaged again</comment>

<comment>Hate is a real crowd pleaser...USA!  USA!!</comment>

<comment>Speaking of hate, how is that working out here for you tonight? Maintaining your usual average of less than one up vote per personal attack posted?</comment>

<comment>They'll have to outbid Mexico </comment>

<comment>Ann Coulter is keeping the audience warm during the breaks.</comment>

<comment>What I was hoping is happening. Trump is not getting away with his packaged one-line sound bites.He is getting killed on substance and it will matter to people in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.</comment>

<comment>That's generous </comment>

<comment>mmm... no. The people in Iowa and New Hampshire are stupid and are ignorant of substance.</comment>

<comment>There hasn't been any substance in this entire debate. None of the other candidates are any better.</comment>

<comment>Because corporations aren't responsible for prioritizing profit over people.</comment>

<comment>Because you run a country like your mama ran her household.</comment>

<comment>"jawbs"? "jarbs"What are these right wing fucktards saying? They are always pimping "jawbs"... yet their policies are totally against job creation.And Carson? Ugh. Wrap it up and take it home. You are done.</comment>

<comment>They took our jerbs!</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Lol</comment>

<comment>I think you're confused, only Democrats cheer for government.  Republicans boo government.</comment>

<comment>Vat are they talking about?</comment>

<comment>Rubio answers entitlement question without saying a single thing about Social Security and Medicare.  Nobody wants to talk about the fact that Medicare is the primary engine driving our massive accumulation of debt.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Social Security is run reasonably well.  People's benefits are tied to their contributions.  (SSDI, though is a serious fiscal problem.)Medicare is a fiscal disaster.  Fixed rate of contributions, but unlimited benefits.</comment>

<comment>Dont forget "disability"</comment>

<comment>Piss on you economics</comment>

<comment>Trump got booed by the audience for going birther on Cruz? Oh, that's right.....birther cr*p isn't okay when its a white Republican!</comment>

<comment>Was it as crude and vile over at MJ as it has been here?</comment>

<comment>I was wondering when St Ronnie would make an appearance </comment>

<comment>Bahahahahahahahahahaha!  Cruz is proud of a Laffer endorsement of his tax plan.  Bahahahahahahahahahaha!</comment>

<comment>Doesn't matter, crowd totally lost right now.</comment>

<comment>Let's spend a couple of hours pretending that someone other than Trump will be the nominee.  For purely academic reasons, let's ask the others questions about policies that they'll never have the opportunity to enact.  Their pusillanimous answers about Muslim immigration underscore their unfitness for the office and the task.  Cometh the hour, cometh the man.</comment>

<comment>As if Trump will do anything he proposes. Seriously, how does one get Mexico to pay for a wall? Get real, chump.</comment>

<comment>Tax remittances.</comment>

<comment>Someone say "JAWBS"I need my GOP fix.</comment>

<comment>America is great now</comment>

<comment>"I wanna use that same appeal... whatever it may be"Trump is actually more honest than people give him credit for.'Of course he is an idiot.</comment>

<comment>Police are pigs</comment>

<comment>State's rights, fatty</comment>

<comment>Christie is a sad, fat fcuk. Does anyone disagree with that statement?</comment>

<comment>Agreed </comment>

<comment>Disagree with your ordering of the 'c' and the 'u'. :-P</comment>

<comment>I think you are a sad excuse for a human being and I am glad you are not a conservative.</comment>

<comment>Cons are the phucking ignorant aholes</comment>

<comment>And you sir are sadly are a representative  of the democrat base</comment>

<comment>Im more a republican hater than dem, you know nothing.</comment>

<comment>Yes another lefty hater and a proud one at that.</comment>

<comment>I hate republicans, and am very proud of it. Phuck every one them.</comment>

<comment>What were the protestors chanting?</comment>

<comment>At one point they were chanting for Rand Paul.</comment>

<comment>Thanks, I couldn't make it out live!</comment>

<comment>The police have to realize, the black man also wants to get home to his family </comment>

<comment>...white Americans are so oppressed... they were just late to the party.</comment>

<comment>"At the end of the day, the country needs healed." -- KasichLet's heal his grammar.</comment>

<comment>Let's heal his ethics and callow ambition.</comment>

<comment>Ok.... Rubio is pimping FEAR now.Marco Rubio...the Cuban Pimp...ernel</comment>

<comment>Yeah every answer Rubio gives is said with an inflection that suggests it might be the last response of his life.  Sadly, none of his answers have been.</comment>

<comment>What were the people in the crowd chanting before Kasich spoke?</comment>

<comment>He said it again, "when I'm president"</comment>

<comment>He done did it again!</comment>

<comment>Great debate between Cruz and Rubio</comment>

<comment>Nah.... just noise</comment>

<comment>Hey Klug, remember when there were smart people here?</comment>

<comment>What a wise remark</comment>

<comment>They were funny, too. And clever. </comment>

<comment>You are killing me 😭</comment>

<comment>If only.</comment>

<comment>Zing!</comment>

<comment>Rubio is (yet another) disgusting piece of sad right wing shite.</comment>

<comment>All of them are</comment>

<comment>LOVE seeing the Republican clowns feed on each other.</comment>

<comment>One of these seven clowns will be the Republican nominee.  Napping Ben Carson seems most qualified simply by virtue of keeping his eyes and mouth closed most of the night.</comment>

<comment>Carson is seriously asleep. Go figure (that's a midwest expression)</comment>

<comment>He's obviously drugged.</comment>

<comment>The most intelligent thing I have heard from a Republican event today is "Ameritude!  Over here, USA!  Over there, USA!"Really sad.</comment>

<comment>Poor Jeb (!)Someone should tell him that the more he whines, the more he comes across as a whiner (YO JEB:: YOU SOUND LIKE A WHINER) (seems obvious, eh? But these guys are not that smart).</comment>

<comment>But whiner and winner have so many letters in common, thinks Jeb!</comment>

<comment>Sadly, he probably thinks the same. He doesn't seem a monster like Trump or Cruz but his weaseling right wing values are toxic, no doubt. Still, his deer-in-the-headlights presentation this whole campaign makes one wonder: did he not realize what he was getting into or is he just some sort of goober without a clue,</comment>

<comment>And Rand Paul is at home tonight eating pizza, getting a hummer, catching up on twitter..</comment>

<comment>Closing remarks: gubmint, isis, islam, taxes, st ronnie. Good night.</comment>

<comment>Something needs to be done about the paid stooges from the Bush/Rubio camp jeering everyone else.  Obvious audience plants.</comment>

<comment>Like a NASCAR race with no crashes: a waste of time.</comment>

<comment>Rape is just a little inconvenience. Its no crime.We need to accommodate other cultures and accept rape.Legalize Rape / Clinton 2016!</comment>

<comment>I wuz raised by a blind guitar player bluesman  pimp and an opera singer momma challenged by the SATs and the IRS tax code...</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie needs to meet the private sector. That sack of shite should never have held public office.</comment>

<comment>Ben Carson asks you to join him in ....a play-do session..</comment>

<comment>Rape is a non-issue.Women need to accept such a little inconvenience because accepting other cultures is the right thing to do.</comment>

<comment>And Rubio is going the "god" route. And the number of his lies are exhausting...</comment>

<comment>The Benghazi movie, lol</comment>

<comment>Cruz.... doing a Hollywood movie tie-in....BENGHAZI!!!!What a fcuking, creep.He will "have your back"What a fcuking scumbag.Punch that face!</comment>

<comment>Women want to be raped. They crave it.Thats why they support Bill Clinton and muslim immigrants.Have at it boys. No Means Yes / Hillary 2016!!</comment>

<comment>Go for the high risk high reward play and put on blackface before you violently rape someone. If you get caught as a white man you'll be guilty of aggravated rape and a hate crime, but if your cover isn't blown the media will actively try to cover up your actions.</comment>

<comment>Bernie Sanders is going to mop the floor with Trump and win in a landslide.</comment>

<comment>Shoot, I missed it. I miss anything important?No, I did not...</comment>

<comment>Over 2 hrs of trying to convince us, the ones that hate government, are the best ones to run it.</comment>

<comment>wait... Ron Swanson is running?</comment>

<comment>If a rape, "victim" ever pretends she didn't want to be raped aggressively attack her as a xenophobic racist.We need to accept muslim refugees and their culture. At most rape is just a minor inconvenience,Hilary 2016!!</comment>

<comment>If the above conversation sounds familiar, it's probably because you've heard the same liberal snark while you were in high school and you were sitting near the Tay Sachs table in the cafeteria.</comment>

<comment>Trump nailed that slimy SOB to the wall, he should have added, Who do you want responding to you when your family is trapped in a burning building, NYC Rescue One or whatever joke of first responders Texas or South Carolina has?</comment>

<comment>2008.</comment>

<comment>Last summer, after the first Trump articles started appearing.  A bunch of 4chan neckbeard Nazis from a site called The Right Stuff (which I'm not going to link here, but is not hard to find) started concertedly trolling the Atlantic.  Since this site has almost no moderation, it took awhile for most of them to get banned, and there's still somewhere between 6-12 of them who regularly post here.</comment>

<comment>Yes, very stirring tribute to NYC's 9/11 response.  But does Trump realize how many of those first responders who died in the towers were 1st and 2nd generation immigrants?  I've decided that the only way CONservatives can tolerate so much cognitive dissonance is that their heads are filled not with neurons but with cheese.</comment>

<comment>Boy, are you desperate to deflect from your favorite pastimes. </comment>

<comment>Trump soaring even higher.....Is there anything that can stick on this teflon ???</comment>

<comment>He has a Hillary quality about him.</comment>

<comment>Applebaum's natural-born citizen comment is grating.  The "weight of the scholarly consensus" is a very cosmopolitan way of saying "probably."  There is no answer.  That's what makes it a fascinating legal question, which a historian like Mr. Applebaum should recognize rather than trying to bury.  Applebaum is not, however, a Constitutional scholar.  In fact, neither is Professor Garner, who wrote his Atlantic piece in one day.  If you want to read actual scholarship on the issue, read Professor Sarah Duggin's 2005 law review article, and perhaps avoid op-eds and hastily drafted fake-legal-memos.</comment>

<comment>More BS</comment>

<comment>I guess I should be glad that it only took 9/11 for Conservatives for learn the value of New York, the greatest city in the world and the engine of American prosperity.</comment>

<comment>New York's a cool place. Wall Street provides valuable liquidity to the economy as a whole. Arts and culture are central to any thriving society.But to call it the engine of American prosperity, when Texas is creating more jobs than the rest of the nation combined, is silly.</comment>

<comment>If you go by GSP (GDP on the state level), Texas slightly edges New York, mostly on the strength of Houston's economic dynamo.  (The post-industrial economic deterioration of New York outside of NYC, LI, Westchester, Rockland, and Orange Counties is pretty profound.)But - and as a provincial East Coaster, it pains me to say this - California's share of the GDP is substantially larger than either Texas' or New York's.  Texas is in second place; California's is half againas much as Texas'.</comment>

<comment>It really depends how you look at it.  NY is pretty empty once you get out of the Metro Area.  Texas has Three major cities(Houston, Dallas and Austin) and its oil industry Cali has several major cities, Silicon Valley and is the country's biggest farming state</comment>

<comment>they learned to exploit its tragedy for political gain that's for sure</comment>

<comment>On Monday the British Parliament will debate whether to ban Trump from ever entering the UK again, after 573,000 Britons signed a petition demanding just that.  A counter petition has just 42,000 votes, mainly in the areas where Trump has bought golf courses.  The British government will ignore the vote as it isn't binding, but it does promise to be one of the more fun days in Westminster.  It'll be streamed online and I highly recommend anyone considering voting for him to watch it simply to get a view of the man from your former colonist masters and oft-time ally, if only so that your disdain for the British may strengthen your resolve.  After all, Trump has no respect for our politicians, he only praises leaders like himself, such as Vlad Putin and Kim Jong Un.</comment>

<comment>The counter petition was initiated by trump's campaign.</comment>

<comment>Cruz is doing what a lot of the GOP is also doing - trying to equate 'conservatism' with 'social conservatism.' There are a lot of  -fiscally - conservative people who tend towards moderate or liberal in their social views. If the GOP alienates them, it commits suicide.</comment>

<comment>This was the big boys debate ? Juveniles fighting over who is the scariest. Rather sad for republicans when the ceramic bust that is jeb bush sounds the most 'presidential'.</comment>

<comment>The presidential candidates from both parties are all America has to offer.  America is in a death spiral and will be an impoverished nation by the end of the century.</comment>
