<comment>My god, the Republican's worked so hard for over 40 years with their "Southern Strategy " to recruit the nations intolerant and ignorant. Unfortunately for the Grand OLD Party their efforts were successful, the recruited nuts, ignorant, and intolerant have pushed the angry stingy rich country club white guys aside and become the GOP majority. Nice goin, congratulations on your Frankenstein creation. and Adios.</comment>

<comment>Trump isn't really a Republican. Most voters know this.</comment>

<comment>He's the result of the majority of the Republican recruitment, so yes he is the contemporary GOP.</comment>

<comment>I despise the GOP and love Trump, so if you're trying to score points by labeling him a Republican; I don't care. Trumps candidacy formalizes what we've always known: the greatest divides in our country are not regional or economic, they are racial. Time for our politics to reflect that.</comment>

<comment>Aren't you the confessed racist/white supremacist?</comment>

<comment>Are you colorblind? That's a form of racism.</comment>

<comment>KKK for Trump?</comment>

<comment>Do you deny that the greatest divides in our country are racial? That black folks don't have a fraction of the opportunity available to white folks?</comment>

<comment>Of course race is an important problem.  I'm black, you idiot.Do you deny that you are a white supremacist?  Don't change the subject.</comment>

<comment>I am. I don't see color at all.In fact, the only reason I know I'm white is that police officers call me "Sir."</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure what you mean here. Do you mind expanding on the idea that our politics should reflect the racial divide?</comment>

<comment>Other than a historical national joke I have no idea what Trump is.</comment>

<comment>There's no "crass opportunist" party, so he's left to run as a republican.</comment>

<comment>It's sort of telling that both the outsider candidates, who really aren't part of the orthodox traditions of the parties they're running for (Trump and Sanders), are running for the primary nomination, rather than as independent or third-party candidates.And from a purely strategic point of view, I think it's entirely wise. The only person to ever win the presidency that wasn't from one of the top two parties was Washington, who predated the formation of the parties anyway. That isn't to say it's not possible, but it would take perfect storm type conditions to do it.</comment>

<comment>The fact that he chose to run as a Republican - and it was no mistake - is telling enough. </comment>

<comment>He is center right for sure. Just like Bloomberg is center left and would pull more voters from Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Trump is not a serious candidate for President.  Amazing how many voters do not know this.As for Uncle Tom's two daughters, they might fool some Republicans but it isn't going to rally the black vote.</comment>

<comment>He has a very good, though admittedly not great, chance of being our next president. That makes him a serious candidate.</comment>

<comment>Hopefully most voters will figure out how grossly immature and megalomaniacal he is before the election.  I mean, not even showing up for a debate?  Is that how he expects to conduct diplomacy? "Wahhh, Putin was mean to me so I'm not coming"?But even if he wins, he is not a serious candidate.  He is a joke.  I have confidence that America will elect a grown up to be President, and Trump is not a grown up.It is like electing a cartoon character to the White House.</comment>

<comment>He probably won't debate Hillary either. So what? Are debates important to anyone other than the media who make money on them?</comment>

<comment>Yes they are.  By coming and debating, you show you are not a coward and that you have leadership qualities.Trump has proven he is a big baby.  Most men show better maturity in the third grade.Are you dense?  Why do you make me say this OVER AND OVER AGAIN?And why won't you admit that you are a racist white supremacist?  You have posted literally thousands of spam white supremacist comments.  It is not like you are fooling anyone!</comment>

<comment>Useless Millennials For Trump</comment>

<comment>Unemployed white clingers to guns and religion for Trump.</comment>

<comment>No one for Bernie.</comment>

<comment>Courageousmisterj for KKK stooge.</comment>

<comment>youtube stars ?  Didn't even appreciate such a thing existed, but then reality tv stars is also a new thing.  Small surprise they see the same common cause as ms foran: clicks.</comment>

<comment>They only have 23k subscribers. It's not insignificant, but ‘YouTube stars’ is definitely an exaggeration.</comment>

<comment>Jesus Christ. If someone tried to hand me $100 bill as I walked into my polling place to vote for Trump...I would rip it up.</comment>

<comment>I was wondering how Trump was going to make my Geico insurance cheaper and now I know.</comment>

<comment>No no we can't unite American whites and blacks under Trump.We have to unite the elites, welfare recipients and third-world immigrants against the middle-class!ABORT ABORT</comment>

<comment>How does "22,000 subscribers" = "Youtube star"?</comment>

<comment>Ha, ha! Trump must be a Democrat. Over at "The Federalist", something I like to read alongside this publication for at least a balanced view on current events, they wouldn't give him the time of day. About the debate: "Paul excels, Christie shines, and Rubio and Cruz tussle in last GOP debate before Iowa caucuses. Trump's absence was not a big deal."</comment>

<comment>If The Federalist wouldn't give Trump the time of day, it's interesting they posted an article about him yesterday.http://thefederalist.com/2016/...</comment>

<comment>True, but it's about how Trump cynically created a charitable fund to suck the oxygen out of the Fox debates. No kinder than what they'd have for a Democratic candidate.</comment>

<comment>"Youtube Star"[sigh]</comment>

<comment>Did you know that YouTube channels mint millionaires? And at least one of them just talks while playing video games.I hate everyone.</comment>

<comment>' South Park' had an episode mocking that moron Pewdie Pie and his brain-dead followers.  He took it as a compliment and uploaded a video thanking South Park for the honour.  I know that murder is wrong, generally, okay always, but I doubt any jury would convict you if you tracked him down and put him down.</comment>

<comment>Isn't he Dutch? I'm not angry enough for those kinds of logistics.</comment>

<comment>Swedish but he lives in Brighton, England.  I could get the bus there if you chip in for my legal defence.</comment>

<comment>What's the exchange rate these days? [Just kidding, FBI!]</comment>

<comment>I do like some gamer YouTubers*... but PewDiePie is trash.*Guilty pleasure</comment>

<comment>It's like they don't understand that a united majority isn't always a good thing without some inflection and context. But how could that be? They're social media superstars - the most professionally and intellectually rigorous demographic in these United States!</comment>

<comment>I don't know, ladies..  I might to respectfully disagree with your assessment.</comment>

<comment>That's just because you haven't negotiated an acceptable compensation package with Trump for your overly-enthusiastic endorsement of him yet.But I'm not judging. Heck, I'd sell out in a heartbeat too (except no one's buying because I don't have enough youtube followers to demand a high enough offer yet).</comment>

<comment>That's true. I'll take the moral high ground here until something more lucrative comes along.</comment>

<comment>I keep hearing Trump supporters claim a "ton" of Democrats support him. I've yet to see or meet a single one.</comment>
