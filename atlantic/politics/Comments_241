<comment>The "Religious Right" was never as powerful as they were made out to be.It was in their interest to make themselves look more powerful than they were. And it was in liberal's and the liberal media's interest to do the sameBut apart from Reagan, who did the Religious Right crown "king" ?   George HW Bush was not their choice for 1988.And Pat Robertson flopped in 1988. George HW Bush wasn't who they wanted in 92 either. Bob Dole certainly wasn't their first pick in 1996. Many  far right conservatives hated  Dole. And in 2000, Gary Baur was the religious Right's favorite.And he got very few votes. Geroge W  Bush  didn't really run  as a member of the Religious Right. And John McCain  was defintly not the choice of the Religious Right in 2008.And in 2012, the Republicans chose Mitt Romney.He was Mormon   for crying out loud! He was the last guy that they wantedFor a group of people that  have supposedly been so powerful in the Republican Party, the Religious right has had almost no  say in choosing the Republican Presidential nominee. And up until this year, the Far Right in the Republican Party has had little say in who the nominee was ,either. They hated guys like Bob Dole,John McCain   Mitt Romney , and George HW Bush.But it didn't matter</comment>

<comment>HW called them insane and that they would ruin the party. He was right.</comment>

<comment>A not uncommon tag applied to them, dating back to Goldwater first being confronted by the threats of the holier than thou crowd.</comment>

<comment>"The 'Religious Right' was never as powerful as they were made out to be.It was in their interest to make themselves look more powerful than they were."You're absolutely correct, at least in terms of their having the ability to dictate the GOP's presidential candidate.  On the other hand, they have maintained an amazing amount of control over party platform issues.  I think this is where their power slips away with the Trump insurgency.  They may no longer have the power to force social issues like abortion, gay marriage, prayer in school, etc. into the forefront.  Frankly, this is probably a good thing when it comes to electability in the general - those types of stands can become albatrosses.</comment>

<comment>MZaleAbortion has been legal for many years now.Gay marriage is legal in many states.And  there is no school sponsored prayers  in public schools.  And for all of its bluster, the Republican Party doesn't really fight hard for social conservative causes .Some individual Republicans do. But mostly the Religious Right basicly just gets  their causes  "lip service"  at the convention party platformsCan you  remember what the Republican and/or Democratic party platforms from 2012 were? Or any year.? I myself could probably take some guesses  at what was in each.But to be quite honest, I don't pay much attention to them. And im certainly not alone in  that</comment>

<comment>Same sex marriage is now legal in all states.</comment>

<comment>Hi Pete:I think you understate the continued success of religious conservatives.  Abortion and gay marriage are both legal as a result of sweeping judicial decisions.  While acceptance of gay marriage was happening at an astonishing pace, it's nation-wide legality is the result of a court decision, not the lack of influence by the RR.Abortion is a better example.  Yeah, it's legal, but the RR has been very successful in creating effective hurdles to frustrate access. Lawmakers aren't just paying lip service to religious conservatives, at least at the state level.</comment>

<comment>There was no small measure of repentance within the evangelical Christians for having abandoned Romney, once they had a taste of Brock Insane  O'Bama, the Kenyan Sheikh Obamination.</comment>

<comment>Probably the apex of their influence would have been in the 2000 presidential primaries, as evangelical support pushed GW Bush over the top with McCain, or at least was a serious part of his primary voter coalition. But they were otherwise never able to completely dominate the party to the point of exercising veto power over the candidate.</comment>

<comment>Thank you!   I had tweeted Trump early on my displeasure that he seemed to be courting the silly evangelical endorsement.  (No, I don't think he gives my opinion any consideration.). I want to see the party evolve with less influence from religious right.  I did not credit Trump for being so smart as to want to peel those voters away from his opponents.  I don't think his faith, or lack of it, should matter to voters.  In this regard I agree with Falwell and those are words I never thought I would say in any context.</comment>

<comment>Conservativism is an unpopular ideology if it can be so easily hijacked by nationalism and protectionism. Conservativism will never recover from Trumpism. Someone is gonna come along in 2020 who will advocate Trumpism without Trumps noxious-ness. I couldn't be more happy to see conservatives booted from their own party.</comment>

<comment>How can you rationalize this when Trump only commands 40% of the Republican support?</comment>

<comment>All right, I'll bite.Who's beating Trump in the primary?</comment>

<comment>Seriously. Kasich is staying in until he loses Ohio Michigan and Illinois.Rubio thinks he's going to win FloridaAnd Cruz thinks he's going to win Texas.We'll see.</comment>

<comment>Trumps already at nearly 50% of primary voters.</comment>

<comment>That's the thing. It's about turnout and excitement. They're too stupid to understand.</comment>

<comment>And two months ago you said "30%"It's like you're actually this stupid.</comment>

<comment>"Someone is gonna come along in 2020 who will advocate Trumpism . . . ."Why would anyone ever run on the unmitigated failures and destruction of such an ideology?Besides, if Trump's actually elected, true conservatives in the GOP will begin their primary challenge next January.  There's way too much money and power being kicked to the curb to go down without a hell of a fight.</comment>

<comment>Trump has chased all the nonWhites out of the Republican Party. The Republican Party is now an ideologically flexible party of White ethnonationalism. They next step is to bring in the White youth. Ethnonationalist European political parties are significantly younger than the general population. White American millennials are no more racially tolerant than their parents.</comment>

<comment>This is untrue.  I was at Trump's Ft Worth Tx rally on Friday and it was a enthusiastic, diverse crown that represented the demographics of my community.  Don't spread ugly lies.</comment>

<comment>No. Trumps supporters are 90% (maybe more) White. But those people deserve representation, too. It's a failure of political leadership that working class Whites had to wait for Trump to come along to get representation.</comment>

<comment>No one cares about them and for good reason.</comment>

<comment>I only care about you Mexicans because you cut my grass and wash my laundry for a lot less than a White will. Bless your hearts.</comment>

<comment>And Trump won Hispanic vote majority in Nev Primary.</comment>

<comment>It was a caucus in a state where Hispanic participation was negligible.</comment>

<comment>40% of the 8 percent of Hispanics who identify as Republican or around 3% of the Hispanic vote. Yes, yes, an excellent victory showcasing Trump's diversity.</comment>

<comment>So there is some support for the idea that white millennials have as many racial hang ups as their parents. But, they also aren't as explicit about it, kind of life the idea that they are more tolerant than their parents and they know they have to deal with changing demographics. I don't think implicit racial biases is going to turn white millennials into explicit ethno-nationalists in the near future. How will they explain themselves to their friends of other races and ethnicities? </comment>

<comment>75% of White people have no nonWhite friends.</comment>

<comment>What's the rate among millennials? </comment>

<comment>What exactly do you see as non-noxious "Trumpism"?  See, for many people, the white ethnonationalism is what's noxious.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter what you think is noxious. It just needs to broaden its appeal among Whites, get closer to a majority.</comment>

<comment>Whites are rapidly become a minority in the US, so I don't see white nationalism as a long-term viable strategy.In any case, I'm curious as to what you see as noxious about Trump.</comment>

<comment>What political strategy needs to last longer than the next cycle?</comment>

<comment>"Conservative Christians lack strong moral leaders who can create a unifying political vision."Strongly incorrect. Christianity's whole founding was about the most moral leader, and anyone who's pinned Christianity to a living man was only corrupting that purpose and who we ought to be following.</comment>

<comment>Wrong and stupid. Please stop.</comment>

<comment>Unsubstantiated and factually incorrect.</comment>

<comment>Your original post is, I agree.</comment>

<comment>And now insults that a schoolyard punk would be embarrassed by? You've got me quaking in my boots here, El Jefe. I think I need a safer space here, now.</comment>

<comment>Based of your libertarian political views, I would agree that you would frequently be in situations involving schoolyard punks.</comment>

<comment>Oh look, the homophobe is back.</comment>

<comment>He's a homophobe. They're inherently disgusting people.</comment>

<comment>Evidence for this? You can look at my post history, I've left it open.</comment>

<comment>"pinned Christianity to a living man"Isn't that how the whole thing started?</comment>

<comment>If we'd like to get all theological, then yes, I should have specified "living physically on this earth," as Christian theology clearly teaches that Christ is alive and well.Regardless, the point is that pinning Christian faith onto a man other than its focus of Jesus perverts the entire focus.</comment>

<comment>OK.  Thanks.  That makes a lot more sense.</comment>

<comment>What's so moral about religion? Some of your "religious" ideas are very immoral.  Your pro-life = pro-gun (gun = killing machine) + pro-death penalty. Plus you kill animals mercilessly. Religion has nothing to do with morality.Religion = delusion, brainwashing from birth, politics and deception. The religious detest science because it completely disproves religion. Do yourself a favor and give this some objective thought. How can you, as a human, be the divine gift from your "god" you've been taught that you are, with a pre-determined human mission to fulfill on earth when it's been proven a million times over that humans are evolved, biological beings like all other living beings on earth...say, trees? Just think about it.</comment>

<comment>Heresy – I’ve had enoughI must inform you that I’ve reached my limit with regard to the antics of the Holy Father.I will continue to pray for the Holy Father, the man.  Most especially, I pray for his conversion.  But I can no longer remain quiet on his actions. Words have meaning, and the damage is real. I have spent three years in the shadows, only blogging anonymously or commenting anonymously on his multitude of errors, blasphemies, calumnies, and ad hominem attacks.  My silence ends today.I’m going public, and I’m attaching my name to the truth.  I’m proclaiming that contraception is an intrinsic evil; does he even understand what that means?  I’m proclaiming eugenics as an intrinsic evil.  I’m proclaiming that there is not now, nor has there ever been, a conflict between the Fifth and Sixth Commandment.  I’m proclaiming that a sovereign nation has not just a right, but indeed a duty, to defend its border and protect its citizens.Oh, and that’s just since Thursday.  Three years of this, and I’m worn out.Have a look at the quote on our offertory envelopes for the Third Sunday of Lent: “Everyone has his own idea of good and evil, and must choose to follow the good and fight the evil as he conceives them.  That would be enough to make the world a better place.”I don’t even know where to begin.  This kind of heresy makes the world, in fact, a terrible place; a haven for abortionists, jihadis, and sodomites, all of whom think their actions are good.  This isn’t garden variety heresy, wherein a drop of poison is added to otherwise sound doctrine.  No, this is a whopper.  In short, it’s the opposite of what the Church teaches.  Surely we can find a different envelope supplier.This blog will remain anonymous, at least for now.  It provides me certain options should things get ugly, which they surely will.  Unfortunately, the main vehicle for my public defense of the faith will need to be facebook.  There is just no other means to get the message out as effectively.  I await with interest to be condemned by my Pollyanna Catholic friends and lauded by the Evangelicals.</comment>

<comment>There is Hope for Atheists!When I read some of the atheist blogs, Facebook posts, and news articles that display a sheer hatred against Christians (really, it’s a hatred against God), it can seem, humanly speaking, hopeless to try to reach these secularists with the truth of God’s Word and the salvation message it presents.And yet, we can be encouraged to read of the incredible conversion of Saul (who severely persecuted Christians) in Acts 9 and realize that God’s Word can penetrate even the most hardened heart. Indeed: “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12).As I read many of the comments by atheists (blasphemous and vitriolic as some of them are), I also understand that they have been indoctrinated in evolutionary ideas. Most of them have probably never really heard a clear, logical defense of the Christian faith that would answer many of their skeptical questions. It’s important to remember that God’s Word commands us to “sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear” (1 Peter 3:15).At the same time, it’s vital that we never divorce any arguments/defense we could present to atheists from the powerful Word of God: “So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God” (Romans 10:17).When I read some of the atheist blogs, Facebook posts, and news articles that display a sheer hatred against Christians (really, it’s a hatred against God), it can seem, humanly speaking, hopeless to try to reach these secularists with the truth of God’s Word and the salvation message it presents.And yet, we can be encouraged to read of the incredible conversion of Saul (who severely persecuted Christians) in Acts 9 and realize that God’s Word can penetrate even the most hardened heart.

<comment>Evangelicals do not have a common political vision. They have moral and religious concerns. If moral issues are front and center, they have a common interest in politics. But today there are many political issues so there is no common evangelical position.This parallels what happened to the conservative movement. Without an overall political vision, there is little to maintain cohesion. Conservatives today are not much different from liberals who are practical.</comment>

<comment>Good. Tying the gospel to a political party has always proved to be a bad move.Maybe Evangelicals, when they lose their political power, will go back to working on their spiritual power.There are still sick and poor people. Still widows and orphans. Still hurt and lost people. These are the people we're told to invest in.Not riches and power and glory.We lost our way. We can find our way back.</comment>

<comment>There will be consequences to losing your political power. It will become more difficult to help the sick, poor, widows, and orphans when the government comes after your tax exemptions.</comment>

<comment>Watch for this strategy:A homosexual comes into your business and starts talking to you about your service or products. They act normal to their outward gender, intentionally. You're kind and helpful, focusing on serving them in whatever particular business you do or work at. However, you can sense something evil, something sinful about them and the slightest apprehension is noticeable, because the devil controlling them makes them aware that you can sense his presence. He then prompts them to mention they have a spouse (opposite gender spouse) and they watch your reaction closely. If your apprehension subsides, even in the slightest, at the mention of their "spouse", then they mark you as being homophobic and communicate that to all the friends in their network.I'm not telling you this so you will hide your beliefs, just to warn you about a common strategy employed by demons to "root out" and identify those who love the LORD to those who are following the Devil's lies.</comment>

<comment>Wow.  Nutty.But please clarify this:Why would they be suspicious when your apprehension "subsides?"And how do they "mark" you?  Glitter bomb?</comment>

<comment>Real life has nothing to do with your mythology. </comment>

<comment>Our society today teaches us that Homosexuality is alright. The President and Vice-President endorse this shameful act, members of Congress endorse this shameful act, and now the Homosexual rights advocates have oral arguments right now before the U. S. Supreme Court.So our question is this:If you are a real Christian and believe in the Bible then join with us and together we can stop this illness of Homosexuality that has polluted our government and threatens to pollute the next generation. Join the Ku Klux Klan today "Soldiers of the Cross"We all know according to the teachings of the Bible what is going to happen to the Homosexuals, in the rapture if Christ comes.</comment>

<comment>Racial suicide all in the name of equality is insane. In the Klan’s opinion, it shows a lack of love and caring for the White Race. The Klan believes Whites are superior to the Non-Whites. When someone comes to a Klansman and makes the comment, ‘we are all God’s creation and the only difference in the Race’s is the color of the skin’, we tell them that they are partially correct. God is the creator, and he did create us all, but there is a world of difference between the races besides skin color.Why are so many people bent on promoting race-mixing and racial equality? Because, it is Satan’s goal to have us violate our Heavenly Father’s law on mixing our seed with the other people of the world. What use to be wrong is now right. What use to be bad is now good. Our world has been turned upside down and we have only ourselves to blame for being so gullible.The Federal Government promotes the destruction of our race through its many programs. They require that business’ hire based on race rather than qualifications, they call this Affirmative Action. The Government supports mass Non-White integration. When the hordes of Third Worlders that enter our country can not work, they go on Welfare. The Welfare Program allows the White people to pay for the Non-White people of the Country to eat and live, while at the same time causing the White people to lack in necessary funds to have children of their own. Our race, through the Government’s power, now has the lowest birth rate. White Men and Women can not have children because they pay ‘mandatory child support’ in the name of TAXES. Our Government promotes Race-Mixing through integration. Our Children are forced to go to school with every race under the sun. They are being taught that the races are equal. When did race-relations become part of educational curriculum? Our Children are being brainwashed all in the name of ‘Humanity’.White people have practiced segregation throughout History. It is conclusive to believe this due to the fact the White Race has flourished throughout History rather than dwindling such as we are during this time of accepted race-mixing. The inequalities of the Races have never been more apparent than that in the Bible. Here are just a few Bible scriptures:Exodus 33:16 "So shall we be separated: I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the Earth"Leviticus 20:24 " I am the Lord they God which have separated you from other people"Joshua 23:12-13 "If you do in any way go back and cleave unto the remnants of these Nations, even these that remain among you, and shall make marriages with them, and go in unto them and they unto you: Know for a certainty That there shall be snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your side and thornes in your eyes. Until ye perish off from this good land which the Lord your God has given you."The list goes on and on: Deuteronomy 7:3, Proverbs 23:27, Psalm 144:11-12, Hosea 5:6-7. So We, the True Chosen people of God, the True Tribes of Israel, are commanded not to Race mix. We are NOT EQUAL IN THE EYES OF YAHWEH.Do you recall the story in the Bible about the two cities, Sodom and Gomorrah? Well guess what, it is happening again today. Non-White cultures, Race-mixing, drug abuse, disease, Homosexuality, and criminals plague our cities. We, as a Nation of White Christians, have turned from Yahweh’s law and have embraced Satanic Order. Our punishment is the society in which we live today.The Double Standards that the Politicians use against us is blind to many. If a White man were to stand up and pronounce his pride for his Race and his Heritage, he is called a Racist and a Bigot. However, Non-Whites are encouraged to exhibit and promote pride in their Soul-less race. Today it is even deemed socially acceptable for Homosexuals to walk down the street and pronounce their Gay Pride.We see more and more All-Black TV programs that pollute the airwaves. Where are the White people in these Black Sitcoms? You can be sure to find a majority of the credits for these Back Sitcoms belonging to the Jews. In a Country where the Majority rules, you would think that the White Man would be in control and therefore rid this land of the evil that plagues it. But instead you have the parasitic Jew at the Head of Government. The Whites are discouraged from taking part in political events, while the Non-whites are very encouraged. This is apparent at any election time. The candidates can always be found having some sort of political rally in the Non-White sections of cities. Where as every single election, the Republican and the Democrat always promise to better the Non-White. The White man is told that it is wrong for him to belong to a pro-white organization. While at the same time it is greatly accepted for Negroes, Jews and Hispanics to belong to Pro-Race organizations. The Negroes have the NAACP watching their rights. L.U.L.A.C. is out there watching the Hispanics. The A.D.L. and the J.D.L. is out there to remind us of the Holocaust every chance they get. But, if a White Man were to join the Klan he would more than likely lose his job and be a social outcast.Our White National Holidays are currently being replaced. With the promotion of Pro-Black Holidays and Jewish Holidays, our White Culture is almost forgotten. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day is now one of the most recognized Holidays by the people of the nation. Malcolm X, a known White Hater and terrorist, has a day set aside for him in the month of June. Kwaanza is now practiced throughout the Nation and dominates the News during its weeklong celebration. Juneteenth is celebrated here in Texas. Why?. The Negroes here in Texas found out that they were freed two years after the fact. So in essence they celebrate their stupidity. Jewish (Satanic) Holidays are taking precedent over Christian Holidays.</comment>

<comment>Jewish holidays are Satanic?Those Old Testament scriptures that you reference -- what separate people do you surmise that they mention??</comment>

And no matter what you call this thread you cannot use it to poke at subjects that are nothing to do with the Lords Prayer.There is no mind set to condemn or defend. That was that covenant. But today for Christians they cannot be homosexual in practice because the body is to be used for Gods Glory not mans lusts or to sin in any way.Christ is for Christians and homosexuality is for homosexuals.  Christians are not allowed to take part in any sexual behaviour considered sin. They cannot sleep with prostitutes and they have to remain in unity with God.So not really anything to do with Christianity is it?</comment>

<comment>Given that both the practice and beliefs of Christianity have become illegal under Obama, it is not surprising that the movement has lost a step or two. Aside from the average democrat, no one hates America more than Obama.</comment>

<comment>Thank God for Trump. He is the only Republican candidate in a generation that truly stands for conservative Republican values. Like it or not, the truth is that a large majority of the American public has become worthless and even worse, a burden on our precious national assets -- the blacks, Hispanics, women, gays, lesbians, the elderly, the sick and infirmed, the "chronically unemployed" (which means the real losers), the "mentally challenged" (retarded). The list goes on and on. Add to that long list of inferior U.S. citizens the 20-30 million illegals we have (the real number covered up by the press) and we have a dysfunctional society that must be purged (to borrow a term from Stalin and Mao) before we implode. Only Trump has the courage and "management skills" to cut out the cancers in our great nation. Then, of course, there are the Muslims and the "transgenders." But i don't even want to talk about them. They're disgusting -- and must be interned or deported along with the illegals and the "inferiors." Then those of us who have worked so hard for so long to earn our places in the much-maligned 1% can feel good again about our country. But not until then. It's Trump all the way! Let's make the USA the USA again -- a nation of rich, white men with REAL power and all the cash.</comment>

<comment>Wow. This guy doesn't even like women!</comment>

<comment>Yeah, Obama took all the fun out of Christianity when he dun banned puttin' yer cousins' heels to Jesus...</comment>

<comment>The only good thing about Trump is that he is not religious.Cruz and Rubio's public prayers are nauseating in their obvious pandering to the religious right. That alone is reason enough not to vote for either of them. </comment>

<comment>I could have told you that Christianity itself is falling away just as 2 Thessalonians 2 foretold.I can name more apostate denominations than I can Bible believing Churches.  Many have joined the BDS to attack Israel.   A secular humanistic worldview is replacing the Christian worldview and the vacuum is being filled by radical Islam in Europe and in time, it will come to the US.  Clearly Ted Cruz would have possibly won about 20 years ago but today it is not likely.  My wife and I will vote for Ted but we will vote for Trump in the Nov. elections.</comment>

<comment>I already have a huge jumbo, gigantic, colossal crush on Jesus, because He is an immortal gorgeous white. He must look very extremely yummy and hot, the real hottest Entity. Jesus is my Babe and Darling. And by the way, China and USA go to war and nuke war. Oh baby, it’s just like the top 2 warriors go slaughtering each other. It’s gotta be the most exciting warfare. Both with highly sophisticated weaponry go slaughtering each other to define who’s the boss on the planet earth. I’d rather see this deadly war when I’m in Heaven. With my immortal eyes wide open, I’m gotta be fully enjoying seeing the top 2 nuclear-armed warriors’ deadly warfare and nuke war, the grandest fireworks ever in the modern ages. The war of the No.1. and No.2. It’s gotta be the most explosive and hottest war ever.</comment>

<comment>@ThePeople4Trump - Are you aiming for some type of outrageous, over-the-top, sarcastic humor? Are you laughing each time someone responds seriously?

Jesus Christ death and resurrection are historical fact, even secular scholars concede to the empty tomb dilemma, not to mention there would be no church if it weren't for the empty tomb and Jesus resurrection appearances!Also, how do you explain my testimony and thousands of others who testify that weve been changed, that we know God through his son by faith, have seen prayers answered etc. Are we all mad?</comment>

<comment>You seem confused, because science, not the good book, described DNA.</comment>

<comment>If science is so smart, then why do monkeys still exist?</comment>

<comment>Are you drunk?</comment>

<comment>Beautiful... beautiful Sir...</comment>

<comment>Every time you post, you make it clear that you aren't very bright. Scream real loud, and your mother will come and wipe the drool from your chin.</comment>

<comment>I don't need your approval, only the love of God.</comment>

<comment>I don't care whether you believe in a sky captain, the tooth fairy or Santa Claus. Get some professional help. You know, those voices in your head can stop with the proper medication.</comment>

<comment>Why wouldn't monkeys still exist?  They breed in the same manner as other primates.</comment>

<comment>You tell me Eviloutionist.</comment>

<comment>I should tell you why monkeys should not still exist??</comment>

<comment>No, not all of us are mad; only those with invisible friends in the sky listening to the voices in their heads...</comment>

<comment>God is real libtard, whether you would like to admit or not.</comment>

<comment>Which god did you have in mind out of the so many?</comment>

<comment>Christian God is the only one. The pagan filth will feel his wrath.</comment>

<comment>Which Christian god did you have in mind? The trinitarian one, the Unitarian one, etc? As I said, there are many little gods...</comment>

<comment>The fact that the 'religious' right are stumping for a degenerate like trump perfectly demonstrates the shallowness of their faith.</comment>

<comment>Trump is the only one who can win!We have homosexuality, abortion rising, Muslims coming in, Jews control everything and restless black savages! How can a Christian live and survive in this country?</comment>

<comment>You know, a bullet in your head could make it all go away. Might as well get closer to God. It will be alright.You're "saved". Move closer to the white light. It's OK.(LMAO)</comment>

<comment>I am not religious. But I will not tolerate something that runs contrary to the basic functions to the human race. If we endorse homosexuality, we open the freedom to bestiality, to polygamy, to incest. THAT is UNTHINKABLE. The legalization of same-sex marriage will be used as precedence to legalize marriage in that respect, and so, it follows logically, if you advocate for same-sex marriage, you advocate for polygamy, for beastiality, for incest legalization. Do you really?Society is not prepared to accept homosexuality. How do I know this? you ask. Well, quite simply, the fact that same-sex marriage is not legal is perfect evidence.Marriage is between a man and a woman. Period. That is the way the law writes it, and quite frankly, the law does not need to be agreed with. Humanity has survived quite adequately for millennia without homosexuality, so your "stagnant society" argument holds no water.Once again, I am okay with putting all of the homosexuals away from society and letting them do whatever. But by allowing them to marry, I allow them into my society, into a society that does not wish for them to be there. Violence from religious group follows. Allowing homosexuals into society will only ensue instability. But even on a smaller scale, same-sex marriage enables homosexual couples to receive the same benefits that heterosexual couples receive. They should not receive equal treatment, at least in the same system.</comment>

<comment>Same sex marriage is not legal?  Are you sure about that?</comment>

<comment>He can't hear you, because he just now found out about the SCOTUS decision, and was suddenly overcome with the urge to date his mailman and have sex with his dog.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, it obviously doesn't jibe with the principles of Christianity, But there's also this curious subset of evangelicals, called "Prosperity Theology" (aka, the Prosperity Gospel), where money and wealth are seen as a sign of God's approval and favor. And not surprisingly it's also an ideology that's usually more popular among the less "affluent" evangelicals (like Trump's supporters). https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Sorry - Evolution-Tards...Another Smack-Down - For Your "Theory"....Sorry for you Evolution-Tards, and science-defying Mongrel-Theists.Looks like the cartoons you use just don't seem to jibe with real experimental research, and observable science?Those goofy "Evolution-Sketches" were pretty good though.Perhaps you should try the Comic-Book Industry?A group of scientists with the University of Cambridge recently published a report in the journal “Nature Structural and Molecular Biology,” in which they describe their findings on epigenetic modifications.</comment>

<comment>"Hallelujah, thank you Jeebus!"</comment>

<comment>Praise the lord...</comment>

<comment>And pass the lube.</comment>

<comment>The fact is that the US did have a sense of being a European, Christian society until very recently. Christianity was an uncontested part of public culture until large-scale Jewish immigration in the early 20th century. The immigration laws were biased in favor of Europeans until 1965 when the long Jewish campaign to change them finally succeeded.</comment>

<comment>And with the election of Pope Francis, the Catholic bishops have been reined in a bit and that helps things as well.   Francis does not approve of his bishops meddling in politics like JPII and Benedict did, the ultra conservative bishops now have to watch themselves and can't be as outspoken as before.   Francis has also thrown in his lot with the poor and disadvantaged against the capitalist system that keeps them poor and disadvantaged.   And too, I thing the population at large have just grown weary about the constant barrage of hatred from the religious right.</comment>
