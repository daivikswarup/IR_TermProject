<comment>I can't with a straight face say Hillary would be a better president than Trump, and that terrifies me. If ever there was a year for a third party, it's this one.</comment>

<comment>To me, Bernie Sanders seems like the heir to President Obama. Sanders is the candidate who continues Obama's vision of hope and change. Sanders is the candidate who wants to empower each individual to have real, fair, opportunity for a better life. Hillary.... who knows... She changes her position whenever the polls change. If Obama's popularity were to drop in the polls, she would drop him like a hot rock. Bernie is Bernie is Bernie. He does not break his word. He did not care about the polls when he endorsed Jessie Jackson for President in the 80's, (and helped Rev. Jackson win the very white state of Vermont). Bernie is honest. He is the one who truly holds the same vision as President Obama, and he will be the one to fight hardest to keep that vision alive.</comment>

<comment>:"Sanders is the candidate who wants to empower each individual"No, Sanders is a Marxist.He believes in heavily suppressing the individual and propping up the stateAnd he's the most dishonest about his policy and will not come clean on the debt his proposals would create even a little a bit.  A completely dishonest politician </comment>

<comment>You just blow in from stupid town?</comment>

<comment>What will be of real interest will be the turnout. Will Republicans cast almost 10 times any many votes as Democrats in SC, as they did in Nevada?</comment>

<comment>The Democratic caucus in Nevada requires voters to stick around for a while for their vote to count.  The Republican caucus in Nevada allows people to vote and leave.  Since it's a primary in South Carolina, we won't have a similar dynamic at play and are therefore unlikely to see such a disparate turnout (though with SC being a fairly red state, we'll still see some disparity).</comment>

<comment>My personal belief is that the Clintons are borderline criminals.  No matter how unethical or immoral an action is, as long as it is not explicitly illegal then they will do it without reservation or apology.  They seem to want power simply for the sake of power itself.  Every word they utter appears to be vetted by lawyers and marketing specialists, every opinion shaped by public opinion polls.  I think they represent the very worst our political system has to offer.  It is pretty much agreed by everyone that our current political system is broken, and the Clintons are the poster children for that broken system.</comment>

<comment>Borderline criminals" huh?"  Go back to middle school and learn about the dynamics of politics Joe.</comment>

<comment>I'm in favor of a one year term for president with no term limits. It will make everyone who wants to be president try much harder and we will always know what is on people's minds.</comment>

<comment>That's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard. The POTUS would then be on perma-campaign mode with no time to govern.</comment>

<comment>What's the difference? Nobody is governing now.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, nobody's governing. That's why Obama's been called one of the most consequential presidents in modern history.One party is trying. The other one is not. I'll let you guess which one is which. If you believe in some false equivalence, you're probably some right-wing apologist.</comment>

<comment>With a divided government, the executive has an inherent advantage in being seen to act-- executive actions that don't require the involvement of Congress as opposed to the legislature needing to be able to overcome a veto to move forward-- while the legislature is primarily limited to actions that are generally regarded as obstruction (e.g. investigative hearings, blocking of nominations), so it's possible that if the parties' offices were reversed we'd be seeing the opposite party as acting.That said, I think Obama has displayed a far greater willingness  than Congressional Republicans for the negotiation/compromise necessary to govern jointly in a divided government.</comment>

<comment>If she is the heir to Obama, she will lose.Good luck.</comment>

<comment>Nope...quit drinking the tea Donald John Trump.</comment>

<comment>Blacks might win Hillary the nomination, but if Trump wins the neocon nomination, he'll mop the floor with her by capitalizing on her flaws in a big way...something that he's exceptionally skilled at doing.Don't think minority communities will fare too well under a Trump administration, but they'll have themselves to thank for not having the foresight to see the big picture.</comment>

<comment>There is no way Trump can win against Hillary.  The "informed" voters will come out in droves and the Electoral College will give Hillary the victory prior to 10:00 EST in November.  (Write this down)  Electing Trump would be like electing Palin or Bachmann...it just ain't going to happen.</comment>

<comment>Trump's supporters have a disconcerting habit of thinking that their candidate has no flaws to capitalize on...and it isn't just the Dems doing oppo research on the Donald, it is also his own party. Trump is living in a YUUUGE glass house.</comment>

<comment>I won't say it's impossible, because Trump has far exceeded my expectations so far, but I would say that it's still a long shot.   Either way, I'll need to hold my nose to keep from gagging when I cast my vote for president.</comment>

<comment>It's the economy stupid...the US economy has recovered and is growing, therefore, 8 more years of Obamanomics would do the trick.</comment>

<comment>Did a flying unicorn who poops rainbows tell you that?</comment>

<comment>Can we please stop trying to create this fiction that there is some kind of competitive race here? The "democratic" party has stacked the deck with superdelegates to the point that it would take overwhelming victories in all almost every state for Sanders to overcome the gap in supers. It's not going to happen.[And no, the superdelegates will not "move to Sanders like they did to Obama" -- the superdelegates are democratic party insiders. Sanders isn't even a member of the democratic party.]Edit: For those who are curious, wikipedia says that superdelegates account for about 20% of all delegates, while pledged delegates are about 80%. So even if Sanders won every state by 20% (which won't happen), the superdelegates could close the gap for Clinton. </comment>

<comment>Hopefully you're right, Super Tuesday should seal the deal. By the way, I bet the GOP wished they practiced a similar selection process, it would have allowed them to stonewall Trump long ago.</comment>

<comment>I also don't think Trump is going to be the Republican nominee, but for different reasons.</comment>

<comment>Wouldn't have helped them, because he'd stick around until the convention, and then if they truly did turn against him in spite of winning the primaries, he'd run as an independent.  You think Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio has a prayer in a general election if an angry Donald Trump is competing for their core voters?</comment>

<comment>WOW  what a thread, Hillary is her own woman and she will run the White House the way she sees fit and for the good of America so STOP with the HEIR crap.You go Hillary, your supporters will always be there for you, forget the haters and the bashers.</comment>

<comment>She is indeed her own woman, looking out for herself and hers.Unfortunately, she is not *our* woman. Sad that people are falling for her schtick.</comment>

<comment>Hillary don't need your vote, Trump might  hehePresident Hillary Rodham Clinton - YOU BET!!!!</comment>

<comment>No matter how many puff pieces The Atlantic publishes about her, Hillary remains an untrustworthy lying old bag of bones pandering to the margins of society who depend on the government for their daily bread.</comment>

<comment>Why not supporting Sarah Palin or Michael Bachmann.  Certainly they would be better candidates than Hillary?</comment>

<comment>HAHAHAHAHAHA</comment>

<comment>Forget being the heir to Obama, the U.S. needs a bolder trajectory towards becoming a more just, sustainable and peaceful future, but continuing the decency and integrity represented by Obama.The Clintons' aura of sleaze, and Hillary's closeness to Wall Street AND her abysmal foreign policy record are why I would never vote for her.As for Hillary's foreign policy judgment:http://www.huffingtonpost.com/... again Hillary Clinton w/ more insight on prohttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/...I am looking forward to doing a  CA billboard with Hillary and Cheney, with wording about both having experience and similar judgment...The incredibly huge, yet unnecessary cost of poor foreign policy judgment could have been used for better education [early childhood,included], better health care, improved infrastructure... all of which would have made the U.S. stronger than the really stupid foreign policy expenditures supported by Hillary.Hillary supported a coup in Honduras that lead to more violence in that country, and then she whines about having to send  illegal Honduran children back, to send a message...I have confidence in Bernie, and the people he will bring into his administration!A better future is possible</comment>

<comment>LMAO@huffington post</comment>

<comment>And the cheerleading continues.I look forward to The Atlantic's crack team of real journalists uncovering what Clinton told her real constituents in those speeches to Goldman Sachs.We know Molly Ball is a Clinton surrogate, like most of the writers in the media. How about assigning a real reporter to cover Clinton?</comment>

<comment>There's a time for separations and a time for unions.  For many reasons, this seems to be an era of separation, not just here and there, but all over the world.Almost anywhere you look in the world today, you'll see the constituencies for separation waxing in strength.  All the old unions and associations are falling apart.  Scotland wants to leave Great Britain.  Great Britain wants to leave the European Union.  The Basque are now joined by the Catalonians in their intention to leave Spain.  Flanders and Wallonia both want to leave Belgium, but not together.  These movements and many others across Europe are now shockingly strong and just getting stronger.Looking further out, separatists are currently destroying the old order across the Middle East.  India and China have always faced existential threats from separatists and continue to battle them on many fronts.  Separatists in Pakistan have already succeeded in adding an asterisk to that country's name.  It's not really even a country anymore.This is also happening politically and demographically in the U.S.  We had a civil war and a civil rights movement that divided North and South.  Now we have red and blue states.  And the blue states are fighting between two versions of themselves and the red states have nearly disintegrated into splinter factions.  It's only the strength of our democratic institutions which are preventing more Americans from going the Bundy or Occupy route.  And those institutions seem to be weakening.  Our predilection for self-segregating into communities of the like-minded continues to undermine our ability to respectfully engage those we disagree with.I'm a long way from being convinced that this era of separatism we are in is going to work out for humanity.  I'd argue that separation is the natural instinct among groups of humans, and unity happens only as a response to an urgent need.  Despite the many many apocalyptic dangers facing humanity, this has been an era of unprecedented stability.  That stability itself is providing most of the fuel to the separatists.  Which is ironic, since we'll need our unions to face the multitude of challenges threatening the continued existence of our species.  </comment>

<comment>Wow ! The Atlantic actually did a write up about Hillary ! That's almost as rare as The Atlantic doing a write up of a black mass shooter.</comment>

<comment>Insightful & well stated, Molly Ball...now more tired, trite, babbling bagger responses.</comment>
