<comment>The left's favorite mantra: "It's not FAIR." We can't save the world, especially if we can't make sure that those who are here understand and accept who we are as a nation. Assimilate the ones we have and then accept more. Otherwise there won't be anything left to be the foundation that the next ones stand on.</comment>

<comment>So you propose doing nothing? Saying "no"?  Who'd have guessed?"We can't succeed so we shouldn't even try."  The battle cry of the loser, and the party of "no."</comment>

<comment>Go ahead. Save the world if you want. No one's stopping you. I support helping people but as an individual because it's my choice to do so.</comment>

<comment>Doing what hard-working Americans do every day is not 'nothing'. They are creating wealth. Since they create it, it's theirs, but if they are generous, they share it. That is the key to conservative ethic - everybody is free to do what they want with their wealth, and compassion is the core characteristic - to give to others in need.Now nobody wants to live off the generosity of another - they would rather use that generosity to get on their feet and build their own wealth.The solution to the immigration crisis is not to let the whole world in, but for other countries to get on their feet and start making a place for the people they call their own. Government authority from above doesn't do that, individuals do that.That's all very simple and theoretical, but it's true and it says that what happens to them is not our responsibility - and they would agree because we're NOT their overlords, right? The USA has a certain unique responsibility to the world, but not one of ruling it, nor even of upholding the rights of every human being in the world. It cannot give or take wealth - the people themselves must create it.As for the immigration, Ryan is a Republican - we were warned about political parties by our first president. Shame on us for bandwaggoning with Jefferson and Hamilton. So Ryan is going to work with his own party first and everybody else second. And he's not going to work with Obama on immigration because the president pulled that stunt recently, abusing everyone's ignorance of what the executive can and can't do without the approval of Congress.</comment>

<comment>Unfortunately this "wealth" that they supposedly create is not ending up with the people who help in the trenches to create it.  You will not have heard loud screeching until the doctors lawyers and indian chiefs start (and their kids) start taking a big hit.  By then...oop's  too late.</comment>

<comment>Exactly- why should I have to ask the government if I want to move somewhere else and get a job?  None of their business where I want to live as far as I'm concerned</comment>

<comment>We have some refugee's that would love your neighborhood...where is that again?</comment>

<comment>My neighborhood is probably majority immigrants, so I don't think I would even notice any difference.</comment>

<comment>Oh, America should remain the only place in the world where people can create wealth?</comment>

<comment>So politicians are supposed to create wealth for rich people?  Who knew?I thought they were supposed to use the Bible to tell us what the Pyramids were for.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure where I said or implied that. People create wealth. If they hand that down to the next generation, of course you will have a person who did nothing to earn his wealth. Now who had the right to take it? That is the only question you have to answer to understand what I'm actually driving at.It's a shame big business and big banking set up shop here, but they get business because we give it to them.</comment>

<comment>So your comment had nothing to do with the preceding discussion.  Got it.  Random.</comment>

<comment>How do you propose for us to, say, "save" everyone in Nigeria because, what, their top 10% of population have less to spend than our bottom 10% of population? How do you propose we "fix" other countries in the world that is poorer than us?Sure, I understand, you want to love thy neighbors, you want to live like Jesus, you want everyone to have equal everything. Reality is, idealistic equality for all people in all countries will NEVER materialize.Look at it in another way, 30 years ago China was among one of the struggling economy in the developing world. That country had even been our nemesis throughout the Korean War and Vietnam War, and China never got anything meaningful help, given its closed doors for so long. But its leadership and its people pulled through, and China could overtake our economy in another decade, pulling hundreds of millions of its people out of abject poverty, all of which without our help. So, do NOT believe for a second that poor people cannot rise above their station simply because we do not meddle into their affairs or give them handouts.But it's true, the people and the leadership of these poor countries have to want to improve, rather than with the sole goal of fattening their own pockets (which Beijing elites do too, no doubt). If they do not want to help themselves, no one with the noblest intention can do it for them.</comment>

<comment>I think you misunderstood me.  Nice rant though.  I think American politicians should help American citizens.  Try to pay attention.</comment>

<comment>Not only do you not want to teach a man to fish, but you want to catch it for him, filet it for him,cook it for him, and serve it to him, all the while throwing dirt at your fellow citizen who cannot fish without a license or your permission.   Of course you feel that way because you don't really care about America or her citizens who are homeless and jobless.  Figures.</comment>

<comment>What you have written is a big, smoking pile of pure bullshit, and you are standing in it.  How dare you teach me what I want?  You're a fool.</comment>

<comment>I would add that we are doing a lousy job of taking care of our own citizens, at present.  When 21% of our citizens' children are living below the poverty level, and food banks are struggling to provide them with basic nourishment when schools cannot, and our schools aren't preparing our youth to go out into the world able to pursue further education or a living wage -- we have no business "saving" anyone. We need to take care of our own people adequately first.The people who want blanket amnesty, are as mentally ill as animal hoarders who unintentionally end up subjecting those they purport to "rescue" to unacceptable conditions.</comment>

<comment>The GOP takes care only of the obscenely rich.  Who are you kidding?</comment>

<comment>Esther, both parties take care of those who fund them.  While the Democrats may fund more social welfare projects, they aren't doing anything but slapping on bandaids when we cry.  I don't believe either party serves the 99.9% who live in this country.</comment>

<comment>One party tries.  Your party is callous cruel and hypocritical, as you so fully exemplify.</comment>

<comment>You're ignored.  Deal with it.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for telling me?  Tee heeüòù</comment>

<comment>Isn't a bandaid better than standing by doing nothing?  Your own words kind of make Motoboto's point, don't they?  Is it really your view that government has no responsibility for the governed?  Just coddle the donors?  That is what you have said.  You sound almost inhuman!</comment>

<comment>I never said the government has no responsibility for the governed, in fact I said just the opposite.  I said both the Democrats and the Republicans show repeatedly that they serve the donors, and not the  citizens.  Nice try but read again, Esther.And while on many issues you have sounded reasonable, you sound pretty much like a Party-pushing person for the Democrats on this one, which unfortunately, makes you sound as lacking in credibility to me, as the Republicans who insist on blaming the other side.</comment>

<comment>This is precisely the problem - that is not what the government is for. We are not 'the governed' but the consenting governed. They are not the rulers - we are. And trying to demand that poor be helped to reach some arbitrary standard of living by legislative fiat achieves NOTHING.No one has the right to take from one and give to another, especially not our offices of civil servants in DC - their actual job is described in the US Constitution, and it is a very limited job - mainly defense, border, infrastructure, civil rights, alliances/trade, and interstate commerce.DC does not generate wealth. Nor do poor people. Wealth isn't just sitting around - it is always created. And whoever creates it owns it. Now the answer to the poverty of the poor is wealth, but between DC and the poor, there is none of that - so DC really can't do a thing about it. The money it has is the money we give it to do what the Constitution says it's supposed to. The Constitution is the contract by which we consent to be governed.Where does that place the responsibility for bandaids and otherwise? Squarely with the people. And for good reason - DC always has to take a cut of what we give it, and like everyone is saying "trickle down theory doesn't work" so how much is left when it finally gets to the poor?</comment>

<comment>Nice rant.  Totally bogus and wrong, but that is .... oh wait, that is the point.Thanks for being predictable.  Always nice when the GOP "everything for the rich" crowd shows up on cue.</comment>

<comment>Do not associate me with slimy partisan politics. President Washington warned us about political parties as well as tyranny. Have you ever tried understanding the opinion of someone who disagrees with you or are you always right, so they are idiots?The government is a monopolistic large corporation that dominates every facet of our lives. Don't forget that they are big business too, and the worst one, because they think the American people belongs to them.</comment>

<comment>I just figured your words had meaning.  Excuse me if I was wrong.</comment>

<comment>Is this a rhetoric game or a discussion?</comment>

<comment>You got me.  I give up.</comment>

<comment>Well, don't do that. Just say something of substance and make a comparison with what I'm saying, then point out how it invalidates it, then I'll point out where and why I disagree, and while we may never reconcile viewpoints, we will both learn a lot.It can be fun and not a waste of time.</comment>

<comment>Your starting point seems to be that taxing people is unlawful and any government invalid.I can't learn anything from that except that you are a boatload of way out there.  Enjoy Planet Phoenix.</comment>

<comment>To assume that you fully comprehend someone else's mind and judge that you can learn nothing from them is pinnacle of close-mindedness.My position is simple - a nation must build its government with human nature in mind - thus the separation of powers at every level, from federal to local, from force of words to force of law to force of arms.The American system is one of the most just, by that measuring stick, and the US Constitution is the contract by which we consent to be governed by the US Government.Now if we want that government to do its job, we need to give it the money it needs to do that. Therefore, taxes.But it also has to hold to the contract and only do what the contract says it must do - that is very few things at all. And it can't do anything else, and so it can't demand for money for anything else. And I think another limitation of that contract is who it is to - the American people, not the world.That is my boatload of way out there, and I would like you to challenge its legitimacy, not the shadows you have been punching at.</comment>

<comment>Closed mindedness has a pinnacle? Who knew?  What a great mental image. And the view up here is great!I apologize. Perhaps it is my own inadequacy, but to me, you are just blithering random crap that comes into your mind.  You are also blatantly contradicting what you wrote previously.  I can't "debate" that.Please go away.  If you must declare victory, you may do so.</comment>

<comment>You're funny, but I think that what I have said is coherent and I would like to know what your challenge to it is because you seem to have a different opinion. Maybe it is a better opinion. What is it?</comment>

<comment>Yes, we have a difference of opinion.  In my opinion, what you have said is not coherent.  That is why I cannot respond to it.I don't have the slightest idea what you are talking about.  Sorry.</comment>

<comment>Your facts are true and inconvenient.  As the Palis vs. the Jews and inner city Blacks vs. Whites where it starts with toddlers, the left only thrives and maintains its power with Balkanizing groups and fomenting hate by the perceived victims, here, Esther playing Rich vs. Poor.   Ignore that the democrat party is now the party of the rich.  Oops.  That's a secret that even Esther is not supposed to know lest her and other faithful soldiers for the 'good' question their message masters.</comment>

<comment>Sadly, that is no more. BOTH parties cater to the 'obscenely rich' with the democrats posturing and throwing crumbs to the masses to ensure their votes. Name one government handout program that has improved the lot of the recipients.  Student loans may be one. The others, not so much. Look at the inner city black communities, prime recipients of the democrats' largesse with other people's money.   Compare them to the black communities of the late 60s' early 70s as to education, job and marriage rates. Ask yourself what has happened since then to those communities.  If honest, you will not say racism.</comment>

<comment>I'll ignore your simplistic notion of what "the left" is. What exactly is it that those who are here must understand about "who we are as a nation"?  I see a whole bunch of people who work extremely hard for very low pay and fiscally represent a net benefit to the US.  That's far more closely aligned with "who we are as a nation" than the xenophobic rants of the far right fringe.</comment>

<comment>Paul Ryan a hypocrite?  Who knew?</comment>

<comment>Oh, come on.  Hypocrisy is not unique to one party or the other. Reid and Boehner had their hypocrisies, as well.Furthermore, it's disingenuous for either party to point fingers at the other with respect to the immigration debacle; both had a hand in it and neither did much at all, even though the problem was mentioned repeatedly.After all, Democrats controlled the house and the senate from 2007-2011, and they still controlled the Senate until 2015.  They didn't choose to do anything, either, even with a Democrat in the White House.</comment>

<comment>Not good at history, are you?  Don't you think you are ignoring the statistics?</comment>

<comment>You up-vote your posts because you are pathetic. What sort of idiot posts things that they don't stand by? Apparently, you believe there is a chance that you are that manner of idiot, and thus are compelled to take action which shows otherwise.

<comment>Wow.  Off your meds?</comment>

<comment>So its the "both parties defense" that you raise.</comment>

<comment>No defense at all. I have no interest in Ryan.  I'm an outsider and I really don't see a difference between him or Boehner or Reid, is all.I simply see the hypocrisy of both parties.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, that was a mistake on his part. It's not an issue of hypocrisy at all - the author is simply taking rhetoric about equal opportunities for Americans and stretching it to apply to non-citizens who arrived in this country illegally.</comment>

<comment>"Oh, come on. Hypocrisy is not unique to one party or the other."To be fair, he didn't say it was. He said Ryan was a hypocrite. Which isn't exactly controversial.</comment>

<comment>I get the moral argument. I even get the economic argument. But it's just not politically feasible now. It may take conservatives deciding to do something. An actual worker visa for people from this hemisphere, for example, with strict enforcement of e-verify. A Dream Act solely for people willing to join the military, maybe.  But until then, nothing is going to get accomplished. Them's the breaks.It will be interesting to see, if a Republican wins the White House, if they would really stop prioritizing which people get deported. You can't very well complain about illegal immigrant criminals, and then waste all you ICE slots on women and children, because you won't prioritize on principle. Well, of course you CAN. It would just be illogical.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  The Great Wall of Texas seems an apalling waste of time and funds.Currently we have unlimited flow of TN work status for Mexico and Canada (although the employer must complete an application for the worker, who must show professional and educational credentials), and a limited number of one-year worker visas, in addition to the H1B, etc.  Nationally mandated E-verify for everything from drivers licenses to school, housing, benefit and job applications, would be a huge step in keeping people legal.  Enforcement of existing laws against employers of illegal aliens -- and imposing the $10,000 per head fines -- would do much to discourage exploitation of illegal workers by those employers.  It is estimated, based on SSA no-match records and IRS reports, that around $80 billion could be collected from these law-breaking employers.That $80 billion could be used to repatriate those illegal workers who wished to return to their home countries in order to lawfully migrate.</comment>

<comment>I wish we had Mexico's immigration laws and enforcement.</comment>

<comment>A stupid argument by the author.  One of the ways in which low skill/low education Americans have been undermined by the political class is the toleration by both parties of a massive influx of cheap labor over the past 30 years.  The times and economy change, and there is no reason we should put the desires of some to move here over the obligation we have to secure the best lives possible for our own citizens, no matter that there have been periods in the past with high levels of immigration.  The overwhelming majority of Mexican and Latin American immigrants are low skill low education workers and the evidence over 50 years is that for the most part their children do not rise much higher economically than the parents.  Let's stop growing the underclass in this country in the name of moral vanity and put our citizens of all stripes first.  That's the point of being a nation in the first place, after all.</comment>

<comment>They've been importing cheap labor for far longer than 30 years. What changed was the laws, multiple times, over our history. 1965's law had some unintended consequences. We didn't leave enough slots for temp workers, but that didn't change demand for cheap labor. They just came illegally. And since they didn't want to risk crossing the border multiple times a year with no status, many have decided to bring their families here. If you want this to change, reform is necessary.</comment>

<comment>The stupid arguments are yours.  Cheap immigrant labor has been going on for our entire history and for other nation's history long before there was an America.  What's your "evidence over 50 years"?  You have none so don't pretend. The overwhelming majority of immigrants of all shades have been lower skilled and lower educated and ALL americans of the current generation are now unable to rise much higher than their parents (thanks to Reagan and his idiotic supply side crap).  You have proven nothing but that you are simply anti immigrant.</comment>

<comment>I guess when there are no more slaves to do the work , then cheap labor is your only way out. How else are the exploiters going to exploit the poor? Bring in more poor people.</comment>

<comment>I think it was actually an argument that Americans are evil because there are people around the world who are not as well off as they are.This idea of income inequality being injustice is not new - 20th century one-size-fits-all Marxism made a big deal about it too, and made the situation worse. Some people are more talented than others, and some work harder than others - why should they receive the same as the others?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Right because the cost of living is so much lower and because countries, justly, have no direct power over each other.So while 500 pesos might equal $1 USD, that's fine because that doesn't mean that what costs 500 pesos in Mexico doesn't cost $1 USD in the US.In other words, Mexico might have a disparity with the US, but the economic situation could be identical with it, and everybody in Mexico is just as well off as everybody in the US. better yet, they'll have a better tourist market from the US than the US will have from Mexico because it's cheap for American tourists.That said, the actual situation is that no other country is as free as the United States for individuals to go and create wealth, so everybody who gets excluded wants to come here. We can't fix that - the other countries have to get their act together. Their people have to be willing to embrace freedom and equality and be willing to pit their lives against the oppression of their government. That's how we got what we have today.The world cannot have it both ways - it must either decide to be independent and act independently or decide that the United States rules it and provides for it.</comment>

<comment>The first paragraph did not make much sense to me. I will only point to globalism and international corporations, how they are a huge problem and we ought to do everything we can to break them down. Money is their sole object, and so they use people.Second, I believe we exhausted one advantage with our costly Civil War and the other with our heavy spending to maintain those interests. I could not agree more about Syria - their leader is an idiot who does not realize that he has no power if all the people he has to rule over are dead. That is not temperamental internet insult 'idiot' - he is a selfish, stupid man.Third, one of the first duties of a government is to maintain its borders. Those who have broken them already have violated our national security and should be treated as criminal aliens. In extraordinary situations, things will change because people are people and their government is criminally negligent of executing its duties to promote the good of its people. That doesn't mean let the foreigners become American - they will have to embrace an American identity, adopt a new way of thinking and living. We can treat people like human beings without making them citizens.</comment>

<comment>And some don't work at all, and sit on unearned income, which accrues a great ROI, which they use to buy back stock and inflate their companies true value. Wait--you're telling me that those are some of the richest people in the world? How can this be?! But...but...marginal utility something something! Free market freedom something!It's almost as if history and systemic issues matter for individual flourishing.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the underlying tragedy of moral relativism has taken its toll. People do not care about other people anymore - they care about money, and so everything is done for the sake of money instead of people. That's why products are crappy - whereas in a world where people cared about people, their attempts at making money involved quality products.Those idiots would have no power if everyone saw them for what they were and refused to buy their products, work for them, do business with them. We empower them.</comment>

<comment>No, it wasn't at all an article about Americans being evil, not by any stretch.  Nor does the canard of marxism have any relevance whatsoever.  yes, some people are more talented and work harder.  You can make the baseless claim all you want, but no one is saying that others should receive the same - we are saying that those who have risen to a position where they can leverage their economic power should not be allowed to ensure that others cannot have similar opportunity.  Opportunity, not outcome - do you understand the difference?</comment>

<comment>The opportunity we're speaking of is for people in their own country to create wealth.Illegal Mexicans, Guatemalans, Peruvians, El Salvadoranos, are not Americans. The equal opportunity is for them to create wealth in their own countries. America has done what it ought in relation to that matter - stayed the hell out of it.Marxism says there is no legitimate distinction among countries. It is not irrelevant. Globalism also says this and that government should be the caretaker of the people. That would be a condemnation of America, and of every other government.So what are we really talking about when we speak of opportunity? What I have said about the rich and about corporations, you can find in this discussion. Power and responsibility both lie with people, nowhere else.</comment>

<comment>If you think America "has stayed the hell out" of those countries then you have missed the entire 20th century -  particularly the Eisenhower years. We have indeed compromised their poorest citizens' ability to create wealth by virtue of our multinational corporations' activities under a guise if pure capitalism and support of dictators.  So please do not oversimplify this with unrelated aspects of Marxism.  </comment>

<comment>Of course corporations have interfered - they are not the same entity as the federal government of the United States. Or are you admitting that they are? That is not a good example of capitalism, but I am afraid you're right - the government and the corporations are in on it together so it is not truly the government regulating business - it is big business itself. And we think the government will take care of us by fighting big business.Either way, I'm saying it isn't really the fault of the government - it's those corporations that ruin everybody's lives, and until people here and around the world take the fight to them, we will be fueling our own slave masters. Don't blame the US or its government for that - you yourself identified the true enemy.</comment>

<comment>I do think that the government has played a big role in abetting the multinationals - Look at Dulles' role with the United Fruit Company.  anyway, sorry I responded the way I did - you and I clearly tend to agree.</comment>

<comment>maybe the author might next delve into foreign aid/foreign investment as practiced by many developed nations and their citizens/businesses, being careful to note how the results are actually distributed.  maybe Ryan might revise and extend his own remarks on such subjects when given a good opportunity--if he doesn't duck such, etc.</comment>

<comment>Maybe the Atlantic's author could delve into the political decisions made in the last 50 years by nations such as Peru and Tanzania that have left their citizens bereft of opportunity. Do they respect human rights? Do they have strong property rights? A working and transparent legal system? Relatively free and open economies? A representative form of government? It would seem those problems have to be addressed before the United States (and Paul Ryan) need to feel any guilt about limiting the opportunities of the citizens of those nations and others.</comment>

<comment>Hmm, should we feel guilty about the disastrous results of embracing "anti-Communist" authoritarian regimes in Latin America?</comment>

<comment>Sure. Start with Chile. Contrast and compare them with Peru. Or Venezuela. Or Ecuador. Go.</comment>

<comment>What of equally disastrous pro-Communist ones?Ask your liberal pals how well that whole Venezuela deal turned out.........?And if the old-guard leftist Sandinistas [ Sandimos ] were doing such a great job down in Nicaragua, then why did tens of thousands of people flee from that nation from what you liberals have referred to as ''deadly violence'' yourselves? Bear in mind that in both instances, American liberals [ I will not even get into the famous Hugo Chavez Jimmy Carter/Noam Chomskey/ Sean Penn/ Susan Sarandon era ],  made the totally specious and unfounded claims that left-of-center governments would be a better deal, rather than to turn their nations into violence-wracked garbage heaps.</comment>

<comment>Pointing out the United States failed policies in Latin America doesn't make me Sean Penn, Nathan. Sheesh, give me some credit. (And note: the Contras weren't exactly bastions of democratic values). Picking sides didn't exactly serve the best interests of the people living in those countries, which was the counterpoint I was making.</comment>

<comment>Anyone living in the US who has supported American trade, the war on drugs, and foreign policy with Mexico and Central American nations since at least Roosevelt, but certainly more recently and specifically the Reagan Administration's Elliot Abrams orchestrated bit of terrorist support, which has destabilized the region for decades now and complains about the ongoing migration crisis is like someone that coming across the problem of 2 + 2 comes up with the answer of 3 or 5.</comment>

<comment>So true.</comment>

<comment>One does not have to support any aspect of American policy to note that communist ideology, and make no mistake, until the mid 80s, there were powerful actors in the Western hemisphere who were hard core advocates of communism, produces gigantic migration crises, without fail.</comment>

<comment>don't expect sense from Nathan.  he's incapable.</comment>

<comment>Then perhaps you should include the fact that you were indeed, ''picking sides''. [ your ''anti-Communists'' ].You displayed bias, in conformance with your ideological beliefs.</comment>

<comment>Let's take this logic further.  What family you are born into also has a great impact on your success.  If you are born into a family with two loving parents, who feed you well, read to you, and invest in your education, you tend to do much better in life.  Therefore each loving, stable two-parent American family should be required to take in 6-8 Third World children so that all can share in these benefits.After all, caring for your children and raising them well is one of America's founding values.  So failing to take in those 6-8 children is unAmerican.  Right?</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>So you agree that other things matter besides the pure equality and fairness on which the author bases his argument.  Good.Blacks and women were already part of the American 'family,' already privy to the social contract.  Their liberation was a matter of extending the full rights of that contract to them, which had been wrongly denied.Foreigners are not part of the social contract among American residents and between them and our government.  We owe them nothing--they have no right to use our highways or national parks, vote for our leaders, or partake in our national economy.  We also cannot draft them to fight our wars or tax them.It would also increase 'economic freedom' to let homeless people sleep in your living room and use your stuff.  Why don't you?  Because you have built up what you have over the years; it's yours; you have a particular relationship to it.  You are responsible for how it is, and how it isn't.  You can choose to admit people and make them part of your household, but you have no duty to.  Just so the nation.</comment>

<comment>I can trade with Mexico and China just fine, without all of them moving here. Your argument is intellectually dishonest at worst, and flawed at best.</comment>

<comment>"A liberal is a man too broadminded to take his own side in a quarrel. ‚Äù ‚Äï Robert FrostIf you honestly cannot tell the difference between a person moving from Georgia to Michigan and a person moving Nicaragua to the U.S. I can't help you.  Start with the fact that when the U.S. is in a war people from Georgia and Michigan are expected to die for each other.Immigration laws do not restrict the right of Americans to "deal" with foreigners, any more than my property line restricts the right of my children to "deal" with the kids down the block on our terms.  Immigration laws restrict the children from down the block from setting camp in my living room unless the people already part of my household invite them.</comment>

<comment>It actually does impact your property through its decline as a key asset due to property value loss. We have witnessed this all over the West.</comment>

<comment>Is that why so many "blacks" are moving back south?</comment>

<comment>That analogy is worse than the one before. </comment>

<comment>Of course, the author, in the pursuit of fact-free demagoguery, ignores the reality that George Washington never would have considered it a proper function of the state to tax 35% of GDP, doing so in large measure for purposes of wealth redistribution, cronyism, and rent-seeking, according to the dictates of whatever energized pluralities can obtain 50.1% of the votes cast in election cycles. Of course, George Washington also thought a proper role of the state included enforcing the ability of some humans to own other humans.If the author wishes to have the current function of the state to replicate that which was the case in the late 18th century, then the yammering about American traditions may have pertinence. Until then, the citizens of this country can quite reasonably make decisions about to whom U.S. residency and citizenship should be extended based upon what they perceive to be in their interests.</comment>

<comment>Heh, you think it's a good idea for citizenship to be extended based upon what americans "perceive to be in their interests"? No wonder you don't want to talk about our history.</comment>

<comment>By that logic and metric, no-one will ever be granted citizenship which is what I bet he  really  wants.</comment>

<comment>I want the citizens of the United States to pursue what they think is in their interests. Do you wish them to do otherwise?</comment>

<comment>And what is "in our interests?" Are you defining that for us?</comment>

<comment>No, I'm not. I'm illuminating the fatuous nature of appealing to the rationale employed by Geroge Washington in 1783, in his particular circumstances, as a means to advocate what the citizens of the United States should do in 2015, with regard to immigration policy. I'm stating that those who which to advocate policy x should explicitly state why policy x is in the interests of the current citizens of the United States. Again, do you think otherwise?</comment>

<comment>I don't think otherwise. I'm asking you to define and explain your position.  I'm  specifically asking you to clarify "pursue what they think is in their interests" specifically "in our interests" and you bring up Washington and 1783 which has absolutely nothing to do with 2015 and the fact that the world has dramatically changed since then.So once again, "And what is "in our interests?" Are you defining that for us?</comment>

<comment>Did you read the piece we are speaking about? I didn't bring up Washington and 1783. I objected to the manner in which the author did. Why must I explain this to you?</comment>

<comment>I'd rather you explain to me what this "in our interests" means that you keep saying.</comment>

<comment>I'd rather you explain to me why you made a false assertion, when you wrote.........you bring up Washington and 1783 which has absolutely nothing to do with 2015 and the fact that the world has dramatically changed since then."Why have you decided to lie?</comment>

<comment>Fourth time now I'm asking you, please explain what you mean by "I want the citizens of the United States to pursue what they think is in their interests."  What do you mean by our "interests?"</comment>

<comment>When you explain to me why you decided to lie, then I will be interested in having further detailed conversation with you. I'm not interested in putting forth that effort with someone who refuses to acknowldege their dshonesty, and give an explanation for it.</comment>

<comment>So, no, you can't answer my question, nor can you clarify your own positions?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I can. I am unwilling to do so with a dishonest interlocutor, until they admit to their dishonesty, and give an explanation for it.It's simple. Acknowledge your lie, and explain why you chose to lie.</comment>

<comment>So, no, you can't answer my question, nor can you clarify your own positions. Figures.Okay then. Buh-bye!</comment>

<comment>Yet another dishonest post.</comment>

<comment>Is reading an issue for you? I never stated I don't want to talk about history. In fact, I implied precisely the opposite, by indicating that all of history should be examined, to obtain the optimal context.I wrote that the citizens of the United States can reasonably decide to extend legal residency status and citizenship to those people who do not have that status, based upon what the citizens of the United States perceive to be in the interests of the ctizens of the United States. Do you think otherwise?</comment>

<comment>Sorry Will, perhaps the way you've written this has something to do with me misinterpreting you?"If the author wishes to have the current function of the state to replicate that which was the case in the late 18th century, then the yammering about American traditions may have pertinence. Until then..."Until the 19th century, the only people granted citizenship were white men, and coincidentally they and their families were the only people considered to be "immigrants." Everyone else was a "worker" (the mexicans, the asians, and some european sects). We didn't start placing legal restrictions (quotas) of immigration until the 20th century. Quotas are probably necessary, but I take issue with your language about "perceive" to be in their "interests". It is the subjectivity of perceptions about who is and isn't deserving of citizenship status that has been a problem.</comment>

<comment>Yes, in other words, I explicitly stated that one could not strip Washington's advocacy in 1783 from the context of 1783, as a means to advocate for a particular policy in 2015, unless one was simply engaging mindless demagoguery. Again, is reading an issue for you?We are a nation which in which the citizenry is supposed to be engaged in self-government. Thus, it is preferable that those who engage in advocacy do so by making explicit arguments as to why what they advocate is in the interersts of the citizenry, as opposed to the fatuous employment of selective history. Again, do you think otherwise?</comment>

<comment>No, reading isn't an issue for me. Is being a prick an issue for you?</comment>

<comment>If reading isn't an issue for you, why did you misrepresent what I wrote, by stating that I "didn't want to talk about hstory"? . Has it occurred to you that one is a prick when one misstates the positions of others?</comment>

<comment>I suggested to you the way you wrote that paragraph leaves open the interpretation I gave. But instead of considering that possibility, you decided to be a prick and ask me again if I had a reading comprehension problem. Have a nice day.</comment>

<comment>Yes, instead of simply asking someone to clarify what you didn't understand, you made a negative inference about the intellectual honesty of another person, by claiming  they "didn't want to talk" about something. You behaved like a prick, and lack the self awareness typically possessed by a 8 year old, and thus cannot grasp why your tone was mirrored.</comment>

<comment>Quite frankly, Will, I don't think you are being honest. And you've yet to clarify your meaning. Down thread Max was also trying to get you to expand on your language, and you ignored his pointed questions. This leads me to believe my interpretation is actually correct, but you don't want to admit this, or you are being defensive because you don't like being called out.</comment>

<comment>I'm happy to talk about anything wth people who demonstrate a willingness to be honest in ther discourse. I am unwilling to do s with those who demonstrate a desire to lie in order to "win" an argument. What you wrote in your first post to me contained a plain inaccuracy at best, or, less charitably, a lie.</comment>

<comment>No, you wrote that I respond to all disagreement with the accusation, directed at those that I am in disagreement with, that they are lying and/or stupid.

This really is beyond bizarre.</comment>

<comment>You really should reflect upon the value of writing false statements. All people, nor even a majority, or near majority of people, do not lie in the habitual manner you choose to. Again, your behavior is extremely bizarre, perhaps borderline sociopathic. You obviously have the cognitive ability to grasp that what you are writing is false, you choose to write it nevertheless, and then find it notable when it is observed that you have written false statements. This is extraordinarily weird.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.  Even legal professionals cannot agree on the birthright citizenship for children of tourists and illegal aliens.  At the time the 14th Amendment was written, the world and the country were much different places.I'm not sure what Will intended to say.  However, I believe most of us would agree that it is the right of the citizens of the United States, to periodically demand their legislators update laws and policies, amending the constitution if necessary.  At the time the constitution was written, people thought it was acceptable to own other people.  The Fourteenth Amendment was demanded and created, to set things right for an entire race of people who had been brought to the US against their will...some of them whose families had been held as slaves for hundreds of years.  Twenty-seven Amendments have been created because as time passed, we saw more opportunities for improvement.Similarly, we have asked our policies and laws to be changed over time, as conditions required it.</comment>

<comment>Really, my only point was it was fatuous of the author to employ Washington's rehtoric from 1783 in the manner that the author did, in support of the author's  preferred policy of 2015, and that it was reasonable for the current citizens of the United States to express a preference for immigration policy, based purely on what the current citizens of the  United States peceive to be in their interests.</comment>

<comment>Immigration reform is not going to happen as long as Trump is a candidate. If GOP compromised with Obama, they could just hand Trump the nomination and save themselves a lot of trouble</comment>

<comment>Trump has zero to do with this story.</comment>

<comment>It explains why immigration reform is off the table ?</comment>

<comment>It's off the table because Obama is a lame duck who poisoned the well and to appease the hard right(Freedom C etc).Trump is unlikely to get close to the nomination anyway.</comment>

<comment>How will it happen if Trump is NOT a candidate? The GOP doesn't want to seal the border anymore than Democrats do. It's all a farce.</comment>

<comment>I think the "immigration reform" is synonymous with "amnesty" in Congress. GOP will only be happy to open the flood gates as soon as they don't have to worry about Trump calling them out</comment>

<comment>And he, the majority Roman Catholic Supreme Court, as well as their grand poohbah "pope", want to see the US become a (Spanish) Catholic country.</comment>

<comment>Ryan is not going to push through legislation as important as immigration reform with a lame duck President in office who has poisoned the well with exec orders. Its that simple and this has a good chance of being a GOP Presidential year in 16 so makes complete sense to wait.</comment>

<comment>Meh, the excuse about "exec orders" is really just political cover for Ryan. He simply can't afford to bring an immigration bill to the floor because the power brokers in his party (who represent the GOP base) don't want him to.</comment>

<comment>There is some truth to the fact that it was agreed he would wait to 2017 to appease the hard right immigration crowd. But no way realistically you can push through any kind of bill of this magnitude in a Presidential election year-no way and that's a fact.</comment>

<comment>Depressing we can't get anything done during election season (which takes up a lot of days on the calendar), but true.</comment>

<comment>Agree. I'm more moderate on immigration than most here on the right and feel it's best for the party to find a reasonable solution way short of a Trump proposal. I see the argument, but deporting a massive amount of people is absurd. </comment>

<comment>They don't want him to because the truth is that most Republicans are in cahoots with most Democrats about illegal immigration and open borders:Despite what either side says, they both are elitists who want the stream of hordes of cheap labor to continue invading our country. They are traitors, in my opinion. All of them.They will reside comfortably in their ivory towers while the rest of us wallow in Third World grime and poverty, competing for scraps under the elitist table.</comment>

It may be beneficial to society overall, which is a good thing.  Meritocracy is kind of a hazy concept to begin with.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That might be meritorious. But if your preference is for a society where everyone makes it on their own hard work, then inviting in people who already have money works at a cross-purpose.  Would importing a bunch of, say, Saudi Princes result in a meritocracy?</comment>

<comment>Isn't there something in the Declaration of Independence about the King having sent "swarms" of bureaucrats to America "to harass our people and eat out their substance"?   Yet I'd guess you'll want to forget about that when the debate is about regulation and the size/scope of government.</comment>

<comment>There cannot be any "immigration reform" as long as Obama is still in the White House.   Obama has no interest or desire to secure the southern border with Mexico.   Just the opposite:  He wants import as many illegals as he can into the U.S. between now and 2017 to increase the number Democrat voters.   To turn Red states into Blue ones.    Obama now wants to import "refugees" from the Middle East, national security be damned.The reform we need is a secure border (yes, a wall) and tracking down illegals and deporting them, especially those who commit crimes on American soil.   That's not going to happen under Obama.</comment>

<comment>Ah, Restore Amerigo...The problem with this kind of thinking is that President Obama has had and enforced the strictest immigration limitations and border enforcement of any President in recent history.  His executive order which attempts to actually do something about our current state of affairs rather than whine or propose completely impossible solutions, is actually quite in line with what previous Presidents have done, including Ronald Reagan.  The actual problem is that folks such as yourself and the do nothing, kick the can Congress would rather wallow in your kind of paranoid, can't do mentality, than actually work to bring some real, practical, working solutions to the fore.  A great wall of US/Mexico: talk about government boondoggles--how about a private enterprise wall, and you kick in a percentage of your annual income to the folks engaged in it.  A Brooklyn Bridge to nowhere, and folks like you lined up to get a piece.</comment>

<comment>Really. What immigration limits and border enforcements? Please be specific! LOL</comment>

<comment>Read this from Reuters, not your typical hogwash right wing Pravda rags: http://blogs.reuters.com/data-...</comment>

<comment>Bookeeping tricks. Took the illegal aliens turned back from the Border Patrol at the border and threw them in with deportations to inflate numbers.  The reality is:http://bigstory.ap.org/article...</comment>

<comment>Your article, while pointing out that deportation has diminished in the past two years, does not, however, deny that peak annual deportation took place during the Obama administration.  Look at the Reuters graph.</comment>

<comment>Look at the article from the very amnesty friendly LA Timeshttp://www.latimes.com/nation/...mmigration activists have sharply criticized President Obama for a rising volume of deportations, labeling him the "deporter in chief" and staging large protests that have harmed his standing with some Latinos, a key group of voters for Democrats.But the portrait of a steadily increasing number of deportations rests on statistics that conceal almost as much as they disclose. A closer examination shows that immigrants living illegally in most of the continental U.S. are less likely to be deported today than before Obama came to office, according to immigration data.Expulsions of people who are settled and working in the United States have fallen steadily since his first year in office, and are down more than 40% since 2009.On the other side of the ledger, the number of people deported at or near the border has gone up ‚Äî primarily as a result of changing who gets counted in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency's deportation statistics.The vast majority of those border crossers would not have been treated as formal deportations under most previous administrations. If all removals were tallied, the total sent back to Mexico each year would have been far higher under those previous administrations than it is now.Until recent years, most people caught illegally crossing the southern border were simply bused back into Mexico in what officials called "voluntary returns," but which critics derisively termed "catch and release." Those removals, which during the 1990s reached more 1 million a year, were not counted in Immigration and Customs Enforcement's deportation statistics.Now, the vast majority of border crossers who are apprehended get fingerprinted and formally deported. The change began during the George W. Bush administration and accelerated under Obama. The policy stemmed in part from a desire to ensure that people who had crossed into the country illegally would have formal charges on their records.In the Obama years, all of the increase in deportations has involved people picked up within 100 miles of the border, most of whom have just recently crossed over. In 2013, almost two-thirds of deportations were in that category.At the same time, the administration largely ended immigration roundups at workplaces and shifted investigators into targeting business owners who illegally hired foreign workers."If you are a run-of-the-mill immigrant here illegally, your odds of getting deported are close to zero ‚Äî it's just highly unlikely to happen," John Sandweg, until recently the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in an interview.</comment>

<comment>Except the number of people being allowed in this Country illegally has exploded exponentially so those figures mean zero. </comment>

<comment>What a load of sentimental claptrap! Due to a destroyed South and a booming North, the country had dire labor shortages in circa 1875 when the propaganda on the Statue of Liberty about "bring us your huddled masses" was erected. The Robber Barons and Big Industry needed hordes of cheap labor.Well guess what? That was then, and this is now. We're already the third largest country by population on the planet, with 320 Million and counting. And 320 Million is more than enough! (And the sentimentalists, as well as the elites, welcome the fact that the population of the US will reach 550 Million by 2050. They think it's great.)As our neighbors to the south are periodically reminding us, they too are "America", not just the United States. So let them stay in their own version of the "New World". And ask yourselves:Why do so many want to leave Mexico, Central and South America?Mexico, Central and South America are just as blessed with natural resources as is the part of North America that makes up the US and Canada (in some cases, even more blessed).In reality, not just Democrats but Republicans as well, both are all for open borders and lax immigration and border control. Both want hordes of cheap labor to maintain the elitist, oligarchical, American aristocracy, and to also maintain a permanent, underpaid, American underclass of virtual slave labor, all under the guise of "we're a nation of immigrants" and "we're a beacon of freedom" and boo hoo hoo.When illegals begin taking journalists' and reporters' jobs at half or less true free-market pay (because the country becomes majority Spanish-speaking), then maybe, just maybe, from what's left of the English-speaking Press, we'll finally see the headline:Illegal Invasion Must Stop!320 Million, with Millions still out of work or working slave-wage jobs, and all the media seems able to talk about is letting yet more Millions in. And if Tanzania or Haiti are the standards we are comparing ourselves and our standard of living against, well, we're in deep trouble.The solution to our problems isn't to import  say, yet more doctors and scientists with HB-1 visas, but to properly educate the people who are ALREADY HERE!And if you think, "we need more Millions of immigrants to take care of our aging population, Zen,", well, if that's the case, where does it stop? Does that mean that 550 Million by mid-century won't be enough? 850 Million? 1.2 Billion? How many do you think we need?</comment>

<comment>Dispite our nation being founded by real estate speculators whose interests were served by immigration there is nothing in our founding documents that enshrined open borders. The fact that those documents both established that borders exist and that congress determines immigration rules proves that our founders intended to retain the right of the US to control our borders.The US is no longer an empty continent. Even if there was some imagined ideal it's current citizens have the political right to change policy in their own self interests. The author seems to believe that we have a duty to sacrifice our wealth and culture to provide opportunity to economic migrants. Those people have chosen to act in their own self interests but citizens of the US are not.</comment>

<comment>This is simply a desperate lie. It comes from Kennys base within a liberal-leftist thinktank [ its CEO, a Clintonista named Nancy Birdsall ], which fronts Open Border kookism and wealth redistribution. Rather, Ryan will do nothing about illegal immigration within the larger framework of an Obama presidency, which he argues is acting lawlessly [ Obama is 0 for 2 in federal courts on this issue ], in laying down imperial mandates which have nothing to do with the reform of illegal immigration except to act as a turnstile for the Democratic Party.                     Americans are not fooled. Despite a solid backing of a reform of immigration, they are also solidly on the side of the border security and end of back-door amnesty ploys so favored by Democrats. Here, the numbers favor Ryan and not Obama, who created more needless problems by his lying [ yet again ] to the American people when his administration first stated that these illegals would garner no benefits. [ they now receive Obamacare, WIC, EIC, SSI, and other benefits which are also assisting in driving down solvency rates for the latter three programs, SSI to out of money by the end of 2015 ].                     Then his administration [ through DHS head Jeh Johnson ], assured Americans that the flood of  August 2014 Central American refugee illegals would be controlled, tracked, and contained. That lie was exposed [ in truly lousy timing as Johnson was at that moment, testifying before a Senate committee on the subject ], by the Associated Press and Washington Post which found that well over 70% of them, as critics maintained all along, simply vanished and refused to appear at their hearings.                   Lastly, is Kenny really stupid enough to believe that more illegal immigration, along with its ability to create exponential population growth here, [ that ''11 million'' was probably the biggest lie from start to finish ]  will give America, especially in the West/ Southwest, more water, less traffic congestion, less CO2, fewer inefficient and older vehicles, less plastics and petroleum-based products use [ these illegals and recently arrived overwhelmingly choose WALMART as a favored shopping destination ], better schools and education administration, [ and thus better use of tax dollars ], better infrastructure and utilities, lower environmental degradation? [ illegal aliens have wiped out nearly extinct fauna and flora all along the US -Mexican border with Texas' Big Bend and Arizonas Organ Pipe being the most impacted with their hundreds of thousands of tons of garbage and trail systems indelibly cut into the ground ].Not on a bet. Thus when we hear lectures from liberals regarding people  acting ''against their self interest'', ask them about their own..............also see:http://www.politifact.com/ohio...http://cis.org/immigrant-welfa...http://www.usatoday.com/story/...http://www.usatoday.com/story/...This last one, probably one of the more important, clearly displays how liberal open borders policies as chiefly advanced by Obama and the above Kenny, have impacts and consequences for the American people.http://bigstory.ap.org/article...</comment>

<comment>Funny how the AP story you cite mentions that Obama has opened more deportation centers and was blocked by federal courts from full implementation of his deportation scheme.Then there's the Politifact one that doesn't mention migrants at all, but rather shifting demographics (older workers are more likely to be disabled, deport older workers!) One obvious solution to an aging workforce? Import a younger one.The CIS report puts up a scary sounding headline (51% use welfare!) without any kind of context about their net effect on the budget. Ie, if I am temporarily unemployed and receive food assistance for month, but then for the other 11 months pay into the system, am I really that much of a drain? But hey, at least you found one that kinda supports your point.</comment>

<comment>Funnier still that those courts were all liberal ones that included his own appointees.Indeed, the entire Obama administration amnesty has been without any ''context'', other than padding Democrat voting rolls, at all.........You seem like a brilliant Harvard economist sort.Why don't you tell US, what this ''context'' is regarding ''net effect'' being as you have no damned evidence WHATEVER that this person works ''the other 11 months''.Thats you making this crap up liberal.Not the CIS...........</comment>

<comment>What are some other countries that grant unlimited rights to foreigners?  Many countries that serve as role models for liberals (i.e., certain European countries) really don't take in too many immigrants.  Maybe they understand that you cannot have both unlimited government benefits and a swelling population.</comment>

<comment>Deport all illegals. Jobs and growth for American citizens first. When did our government take up the cause of the foreign born over that of the native son?.</comment>

<comment>Impossibly expensive in both the cost to deport everyone and the industries that need illegal labor.</comment>

<comment>No, just deduct the cost from whatever aid we send Mexico.</comment>

<comment>LOL, how much aid do we send to Mexico?  Give us a number</comment>

<comment>And how exactly do you propose to work that out? Armed sweeps through neighborhoods? House-to-house searches? </comment>

<comment>Si se puede.</comment>

<comment>That can happen right after Unicorns for Everyone!</comment>

<comment>Close the borders, stop all immigration for at least one generation. We have enough "diversity" already. It's hard enough to get most Americans to agree and come to a consensus on just about anything, and the elites want to continue the Open the Floodgates policy, and diversify us still more, thereby dividing us more, so that they can wield yet more control.Our elites are doing what elites have done for millennia: Divide and Rule!Wake up! Let the soup or the alleged "melting pot" simmer for a while, and stop adding new ingredients. 320 Million Americans and counting is enough!</comment>

<comment>Talking about how immigration reform is needed because it would help people outside the U.S. is about the least convincing argument for people who are not already in favor of immigration reform.Nevermind the fact that, the lofty rhetoric of years past had a lot to do with the needs of the nation at the time. When (for better or worse) it was national priority to spread westwards, or when we needed cogs in factory machine, it made a lot of sense to have large amount of unskilled immigration.Now, although we still need agriculture workers, its not nearly as big of a national priority, especially given fiscal impacts to state and local budgets.Personally I wish we closed the family reunification, did worker permits for agriculture, and shift to point based for higher skilled workers.</comment>

<comment>One of the most incorrect tropes about illegal immigrants, is that they are doing agricultural work."Of the 472 civilian occupations, only six are majority immigrant (legal and illegal). These six occupations account for 1 percent of the total U.S. workforce. Moreover, native-born Americans still comprise 46 percent of workers even in these occupations.Many jobs often thought to be overwhelmingly immigrant (legal and illegal) are in fact majority native-born:Maids and housekeepers: 51 percent native-bornTaxi drivers and chauffeurs: 58 percent native-bornButchers and meat processors: 63 percent native-bornGrounds maintenance workers: 64 percent native-bornConstruction laborers: 66 percent native-bornPorters, bellhops, and concierges: 72 percent native-bornJanitors: 73 percent native-bornThere are 67 occupations in which 25 percent or more of workers are immigrants (legal and illegal). In these high-immigrant occupations, there are still 16.5 million natives ‚Äî accounting for one out of eight natives in the labor force. High-immigrant occupations (25 percent or more immigrant) are primarily, but not exclusively, lower-wage jobs that require relatively little formal education. In high-immigrant occupations, 59 percent of the natives have no education beyond high school, compared to 31 percent of the rest of the labor force. Natives tend to have high unemployment in high-immigrant occupations, averaging 14 percent during the 2009-2011 period, compared to 8 percent in the rest of the labor market. There were a total of 2.6 million unemployed native-born Americans in high-immigrant occupations.Some may think that native-born workers in high-immigrant occupations are mostly older, with few young natives willing to do such work. But 34 percent of natives in these occupations are age 30 or younger, compared to 27 percent of natives in the rest of labor force.It is worth remembering that not all high-immigrant occupations are lower skilled. For example, 36 percent of software engineers are immigrants as are 27 percent of physicians.A number of politically important groups tend to face very little job competition from immigrants (legal and illegal). For example, just 10 percent of reporters are immigrants, as are only 6 percent of lawyers and judges and 6 percent of farmers and ranchers.Estimates of Illegal ImmigrantsWe find that there are no occupations in the United States in which a majority of workers are illegal immigrants. Illegal immigrants work mostly in construction, cleaning, maintenance, food service, garment manufacturing, and agricultural occupations. However, the overwhelming majority of workers even in these areas are native-born or legal immigrants.Although illegal immigrants comprise a large share of workers in agriculture, farm workers are only a tiny share of the total labor force. Consistent with other research, just 5 percent of all illegal immigrants work in agriculture."http://cis.org/are-there-reall...</comment>

<comment>Paul Ryan is STILL an Amnesty/Shamnesty Guy, just like ALL the Bushes.But today, Establishment RINO/NeoCONs are trying to scare up some JEB voters.So far, JEB is only getting the Next-UV-Kin Vote.  If this continues, they will not have anything to sell, but their OWN KIDNEYS.  </comment>

<comment>About 42 million of our 320 million population (13%) is foreign-born. Where else do you see numbers that high, other than hopefully-temporary numbers like we currently see in Lebanon under the crush of displaced persons from Syria? Castigating America for accepting too few immigrants is like saying Mother Theresa could have done more for the poor. Even if it's true, it's woefully lacking in perspective.</comment>

<comment>To be fair, Germany only has about 80% German citizens within its borders, although about 10% of the rest are at least EU citizens.  5% are Turkish.</comment>

<comment>A good 1st Step would be to issue Wanted Posters on Oath-Breaking (amnesty/shamnesty) officeholders, on charges of insurrection and sedition.</comment>

<comment>Opportunity for some, not all. We cannot coddle, swaddle and breast-feed every illiterate toilet scrubber from across the globe. The United States belongs to its citizens, not the Vatican's proliferating litter of impoverished imps.</comment>

<comment>Immigrants risk everything to come here to work hard, raise a family and pay their way. Those are very American values. Sure beats the constant outrage and anti-American cr*p flowing out of the conservative right.</comment>

<comment>Common mistake.  Not believing in open borders has nothing to do with looking down on individual immigrants.</comment>

<comment>"open borders"? That's a common right wing talking point. What does it mean? The U.S.'s borders are far from open. There's a wall running the length of the southern border with plenty of surveillance and border patrol keeping close watch. The immigrants will ALWAYS find a way here as long as they're motivated.</comment>

<comment>I love it that the right is like "people are lazy and entitled... let's keep motivated people out"</comment>

<comment>No. More like opportunistic and predatory...  It plays out with the immigration crisis where most immigrants are receiving some sort of taxpayer financed benefits... http://www.usatoday.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>"Immigrants are more likely to be working than their native-born neighbors. The report found that 87% of immigrant households had at least one worker, compared to 76% for native households."Sounds like opportunistic and predatory people!</comment>

<comment>Stealing jobs and helping to throttle wage growth by engaging in a life of crime is not "working".</comment>

<comment>Haha, nice attempt to backpedal</comment>

<comment>Very simple. employers of illegal aliens force honest employers to follow suit or disapear. those who cheat by hiring illegals, often in cash also cheat on unemplyment, workers comp and other items. Even at that, illegal aliens have not cracked the 25% mark on any of the industries where they have penetrated, meaning that Americans and legitimate immigrants are being harmed by their presence in the market.</comment>

<comment>hahaha, you called them lazy bloodsuckers and then posted a link to a story by a hate group that admits that they work more than average. And now you're trying to make excuses.  Lol, you're funny</comment>

<comment>That is because they work at lower wages, off the books and allow their employers to evade paying taxes and fees like workers' Compensation, unemployment insurance, etc...  It is opportunistic and predatory.</comment>

<comment>If we could replace every single existing American with a harder-working Mexican, Chinese person or Indian, should we?</comment>

<comment>No, I don't think we should replace anyone. Americans should be able to stay where they are, I am not in favor of making them move somewhere else.</comment>

<comment>So we agree that the right to live in America is not allocated on a Who-is-hardest-working basis.  On what basis is it allocated, in your opinion?</comment>

<comment>Accident of birth and ability to get a visa.  Is this controversial?</comment>

<comment>So if someone were to say "It is unfair that because of an accident of birth some people have access to the opportunities that come with living in America and others do not.  Fairness and equality demand that we admit large numbers of immigrants," you would disagree?</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't put it that way.  I would say that I don't think government has any business deciding where I want to live so therefore it has no business deciding where others want to live.</comment>

<comment>So in your view if I want to work all my life in the United States, then move somewhere like Sweden that has very generous retirement and health benefits, that's fine?  Or I could run an extremely dirty polluting business here, then move away when the government has to raise taxes to clean up--take my money and move to somewhere with a great unspoiled environment?  I could live somewhere with very low taxes, terrible education and healthcare, but send my children to school in Massachusetts?  If a country invests in building up an excellent high-tech industry, with investments in universities, infrastructure, subsidies for business, etc. I can just move there and take a job having made no contribution?  I can have 10 children then move my family to a nice uncrowded place were the government has invested in sex education and family planning? Can I vote for warlike politicians and then just move away if my country gets in a war as a result?This sounds great.  Why should I feel any responsibility or loyalty to any particular society?  Why shouldn't I reap the benefits of the investments others have made in their societies?  This will be awesome...as long as I am the only one who gets to do it. </comment>

<comment>Your retirement benefits could be portable.  That's an easy fix.  Countries already do that."If a country invests in building up an excellent high-tech industry, with investments in universities, infrastructure, subsidies for business, etc. I can just move there and take a job having made no contribution?"You are making a contribution by moving there.</comment>

<comment>You are a nutter. I move to a place, I walk the streets others built, I take advantage of the society, the laws, courts, schools, institutions that have been built up over hundreds of years.  In your view everyone is an atomistic individual, societies and the social fabric don't exist, and it is always Day One.I genuinely do not understand open borders people.  It's like talking to someone with a brain defect where they cannot differentiate their own children from strangers.  "Why should I feed this child instead of that one?"  "Because that child is YOURS!"  "Huh?"There's really no point in arguing.  Fortunately your view is a fantasy and will never be adopted on any large scale. I do fear it will have some affect on the U.S. immigration debate.  Talking to you about it is a waste of time, the only thing to do is oppose your ideas wherever they appear.</comment>

<comment>If not allowing people to immigrate to the U.S. is denying equality of opportunity, open borders naturally follows.  There is a growing open borders movement and, oddly enough, it is free-market extremists like Bryan Caplan and Tyler Cowan who are pushing it.So it is a "right-wing talking point," but not the way you mean.</comment>

<comment>Tagliano? You aboriginal or a greaseball?</comment>

<comment>Greaseballs, porch monkeys, orientals blindfolded with dental floss - as long as they were born here they can't be deported.</comment>

<comment>Suck your bong, dong Wong.</comment>

<comment>One of his very first moves as House speaker was to take immigration reform off the agenda....===========Breaking News: The House Republican majority is advancing a bill to have the Statue of Liberty taken down, cut up and returned to France.</comment>

<comment>That is just heartbreaking! Don't they know that Emma Lazarus' words are in fact Codified Law?</comment>

<comment>One suspects this was one of the Freedom Scofflaw bargaining chips.  What, me worry? Immigration problem? Issues of war and peace? Infrastructure? Science? Energy? As with evolution it seems, the Devil is in details, so let's have another round of outlawing ACA, with a chaser of anti abortion bills and tax cuts for the wealthy, along with a steady dose of corporate welfare for those exporting jobs, bank deregulation, and climate change denialism; throw in a coupla committees to investigate Vince Foster and educating women all on the taxpayer dime.  Something for nothing and freedom fries for free.</comment>

<comment>If there's one thing I can't stand it's exclusionary restrictionists like those self-centered fascists who want to set annual immigration caps. Or those prissy, control freaks who cried "rape!" when a marginalized African American celebrity tried to express his sexuality with them.</comment>

<comment>Come on dude, at least be funny if you're going to troll. Like, the rape part just drowned an already sinking ship.</comment>

<comment>Immigrants are the highest form of American values. We need more. They're an example of everything good about the US.</comment>

<comment>I'm still hungover 2 days later...</comment>

<comment>Lol, no way lol. How was it?</comment>

<comment>My friend says I climbed over a bar.  I have a vague recollection of said event.</comment>

<comment>There's no reason for Paul Ryan to try and work with Obama on comprehensive immigration reform. Obama has proven over the last 6 years that he doesn't negotiate in good faith, and would rather demagogue an issue rather than compromise. Better to wait for the next President. I think even Hillary would come to the table willing to get something done better than Obama would.Republicans don't hate immigrants, they merely want to stop ILLEGAL immigration, and restore order to the immigration process os that we as citizens have control over who we let into our country. That said, we have had decades of mismanagement of the immigration process by both Republican and Democrat, and now we have millions of illegal immigrants in the country. No way we deport all of them, so we need to come to a solution to make them legal in some manner.</comment>

<comment>Lol, GOP negotiating in good faith? Bro, no, the GOP can't even pass a budget agreement without using faked videos to defund PP. They're the kinghts in shining armor of dishonesty.</comment>

<comment>Never been to San Pedro Sula or Caracas I see.</comment>

<comment>Awesome like Ferguson? THAT awesome? No way!</comment>

<comment>Many of the founding fathers owned human beings as livestock.  Clearly they had a very selective idea about who should actually benefit in America.If you're going to use history as your proof of what  America was intended to be, and what it should be, make sure to parse the actions and not just the words of the past.</comment>

<comment>Back then, a lot of folks owned humans, and not all were white.  In many places emancipation was teoretical as the "poor" were now in economic slavery to the same folks who now didn't have to feed or clothe them.</comment>

<comment>Expecting anything but totally bodacious, funky-fresh workout photos from Paul Ryan is an exercise in futility.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, almost as cliched as the photos of cloying, quivering barrio urchins holding "Please don't deport my mommy" placards.</comment>

<comment>You said "cliched," not me. I said "totally bodacious" and "funky-fresh." I'll just go ahead and add "radical" and "gnarly to the max," too, while I'm here.</comment>

<comment>looks like a horde of nativists on this page.  I support a free market, which means a free labor market. I don't know why people have so much trouble understanding that you can't have one without the other.</comment>

<comment>You can't have both open borders and a welfare state, as even a moment's reflection would have revealed to you.</comment>

<comment>This is a saying that has never been proven. "An apple a day keeps the doctor away" has about as much empirical evidence to support it.</comment>

<comment>Europe is proving it today...  Where are all the ablebodied "refugees" going???</comment>

<comment>It's not proving any such thing.  This "you can't have both open borders and a welfare state" is one of the more objectively stupid "truisms" out there.How, exactly, is allowing immigrants into the nation going to harm the welfare state? Immigrants are a self-selected group that by its nature are more motivated than poor people who stay behind (for obvious reasons- duh, if you're lazy you don't move).  These are people who are more likely to pay taxes than people already living here.</comment>

<comment>Right...  http://www.usatoday.com/story/...Your hind end must be envious of your head as it produces more stool than it...</comment>

<comment>Oh nice, USA today is quoting hate groups</comment>

<comment>Must have run out of blather...  so the smear brush comes out.</comment>

<comment>Right. We need all the illiterate, non-English speaking, unskilled workers we can possibly get, because we are already at full employment. Jobs are going begging because the evil Rethuglicans won't let these highly motivated workers in.But, oddly, they end up on food stamps and welfare as soon as it's legal for them. Must be a coincidence ...</comment>

<comment>More nonsense.</comment>

<comment>It is true that "some studies show" that, by the third generation, immigrants do contribute to the economy -- but the first two are deadweight loss. And that is assuming economic conditions that applied in the mid-20th century and do not today.But perhaps you haven't noticed that the US is now $17B in debt -- over $50K for every man, woman, and child (legal or illegal) in the US. We can't afford two generations of millions of people who will only add to that colossal debt in hopes that the knowledge economy will pay the third generation as well as previous economies paid previous descendants of immigrants.Most folks like you who argue for completely open borders assume that 21st century immigrants will have the same positive effects as 15th-mid-20th century immigrants. Given the vast change in our economy, that is simply not possible.And, just by the way, can I sleep at your place tonight? If not, why not?</comment>

<comment>"It is true that "some studies show" that, by the third generation, immigrants do contribute to the economy -- but the first two are deadweight loss"Nonsense.  Are you getting your info from Ben Carson?"But perhaps you haven't noticed that the US is now $17B in debt -- over $50K for every man, woman, and child (legal or illegal) in the US"I love it every time people bring this up. Who is that money owed to and what are the chances that we won't be able to borrow more?  You might want to give that some thought.</comment>

<comment>Being stupid and mouthy is no way to go through life.  https://www.cbo.gov/sites/defa...Most of the estimates found that even though unauthorized immigrants pay taxes and other fees to state and local jurisdictions, the resulting revenues offset only a portion of the costs incurred by those jurisdictions for providing services related to education, health care, and law enforcement. Although it is difficult to obtain precise estimates of the net impact of the unauthorized population on state and local budgets (see Box 1), that impact is most likely modest.</comment>

<comment>Let's terminate all welfare first and take all unemployed slackers and put them on collective farms where they can earn their keep. After that, if we need more laborers, we can grow them in petri dishes ourselves.</comment>

<comment>So, we have too many lazy people, but people who want to come here to work should be told no?  That makes no sense.  Go away.</comment>

<comment>Those of you who were asking recently about conservatives that approve of Communist methods, here's one of them</comment>

<comment>I support the integrity of a Nation's borders, its character and its people. The current crop of foreigners who see our citizenship as a work permit stand in the way of a unified national will.  I, as a Hispanic, see the worth in an immigration timeout and the incompatibility of dual citizenship with US citizenship. You can serve our Nation or the one you left. You can't serve two masters.</comment>

<comment>"unified national will"*snort*, yeah that's why our nation is divided.</comment>

<comment>Since the 1965 immigration law pushed through by the drunk murderer from Massachusetts...  We've gone from a melting pot nation where foreigners assimilate to the salad bowl nation where they not only refuse to assimilate but demand to be accommodated in order to live in little ethnocentric cultural ghettos.</comment>
