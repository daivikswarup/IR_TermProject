<comment>Nothing on the internet is private. Every post has an IP address, doesn't it?</comment>

<comment>And when it comes to national security and terrorism threats, with the proper legal protections according to circumstances nothing should be private.</comment>

<comment>At the very least, questionable internet posts should flag an immigration applicant for further security screening.</comment>

<comment>Sure, but do you really think your government can read every internet post everyone attempting to enter this country ever made? The best they could do is some sort of "key word" screen.</comment>

<comment>WOULD THAT NOT BE FAR BETTER THAN HOW THEY DO NOTHING NOW? THEY ALREADY HAVE THE PROGRAMS --</comment>

<comment>...Unless you use a browser such as Tor.</comment>

<comment>Which actual terrorists would use.  The argument that gun laws would only affect law-abiding citizens should resonate with gun owners in this case.  There is a direct correlation here.  Terrorists will get around the surveillance with end-to-end encryption.  Ordinary folks are the ones whose freedoms are abridged.</comment>

<comment>Sure, the server hosting that is probably hacked by various intelligence agencies weekly, better be compiling it from source yourself and not using a binary.</comment>

<comment>Actually TOR was created by the CIA and NSA specifically to prevent even intelligence agencies with huge resources from tracking such posters, initially primarily to protect dissidents in Iran from being tracked by their government. I understand that it's basically mathematically unbreakable, regardless of the resources thrown at it. Which some in the CIA now regret, naturally.Probably the biggest downside to the Snowden revelations, intelligence sources claim anyway, is that it showed Al Qaeda and ISIS what their intelligence vulnerabilities are, and so they're much better at hiding their leaders and plans from NSA tracking by using tools like TOR.</comment>

<comment>Sure does, and mine is currently showing from Illinois.  Two button clicks and it could be showing Sweden.  Even then it leads back to the public wifi at a business I'm not currently even in (I'm sitting at the cafe next door waiting for my lunch).</comment>

<comment>and did you check your personal email account with that ip address?</comment>

<comment>No, I used my phone which was on the Verizon network, which is also where I bought an item from Amazon.</comment>

<comment>Well over the years you have posted to you account with many ip addresses, once, before you knew you were going to threaten people or solicit minors, it was from a cellphone, oops.</comment>

<comment>I'm protecting myself from vindictive nutters in The Atlantic comments section, not from the NSA or the FBI.  They have, at best, the ability to figure out what IP I'm posting from, not any ability to correlate that back to what other services I may have accessed under that IP.</comment>

<comment>Yes, the left's embrace of the Obama cult, with its intense adulation and creepy iconography, its messianic messaging, and promises of government-produced comfort and safety has led to this. Now it looks like the right may be ready to embrace its own version.</comment>

<comment>That's a bit extreme.  Remember how we were told "there was nothing to see here folks, everything's fine. Just go back to shopping" in 2002?</comment>

<comment>And yet, we've had less than 100 deaths due to jihadist inspired terrorism in the United States in the nearly 15 years since.  Just go back to shopping and everything will be fine was 100% right.Unfortunately, the Bush administration's proper sense of perspective was drowned out by the public's hysteria and irrationality.  They eventually caved and created the abomination that is the Department of Homeland Security and the round the clock security theater show run by the Transportation Security Administration.  The primary blame for these monstrosities is the irrational expectation among the public that all terrorism can and should be prevented.  It's created a perverse race to the bottom among politicians to strip away freedoms and waste taxpayer money on wild goose chases.Just because the media sensationalizes every terrorist story for profit and ratings dose not mean the public has to be duped each time.  We as a society are primarily to blame because the politicians rushing to create a police state are responding to our hysterical ranting.</comment>

<comment>Less than 100? Indeed. Actually just 28,http://www.vox.com/2015/11/23/...</comment>

<comment>I think that is missing San Bernardino, which I believe is the jihadist terrorist attack in the US with the largest number of casualties since 9/11 (arguably the Boston Marathon bombing was significantly worse) -- an amazing indication of how minute the threat of terrorism has actually been in that period.I deliberately chose 100 to be safe, because i am not interested in squabbling over the classification of every single event as jihadist terror or not.  Even with the conservative overestimate, the point still stands that terrorism is not a major concern and that when George W. Bush implored Americans to go about business and return to shopping, he was giving great advice that we as a nation have sadly forgotten.The public has a short attention span.  Democrats pilloried Bush for those comments, but he has proven to be right.  Today's Trump supporters who agree with his Iraq War stance almost universally supported the war at the time and questioned the patriotism of those opposed.  Our politics has a growing mob quality to it that leads to things like the creation of the TSA and the candidacy of Donald Trump.</comment>

<comment>Good catch. You're right, on San Bernardino not being counted. Nor was the Colorado Springs attack on Planned Parenthood on the other side of the ledger.Of course, that still leaves us well under 100 killed by all forms of terrorism in America since 9/11, as you say. Against 400,000+ Americans killed by our own guns since 9/11. But the real threat is Sharia!Though I'd add to your last paragraph that if you're gonna blame the Dems for grumbling about Dubya's call to go shopping, give the Dems credit for agreeing with the main point he was trying to make, that we shouldn't demonize all Muslims just because of Al Qaeda and a few nuts who want us to do just that, to be terrorized. A point many in Dubya's own party grumbled about (loudly), then and now.I'm not sure the TSA, while it's often a waste of money, is really in the same category as attacking Iraq, or barring Syrian refugees or Muslim tourists, or questioning the patriotism of antiwar citizens, or the nativist streak that Trump has brought out in our polity. I think the TSA is more along the lines of, we have to do something to make flying (feel) safe again, creating the TSA is something, let's do that.</comment>

<comment>It's sad to think that the mindset of "Let's go after the terrorists and not blame groups of people for the heinous atrocities of particular individuals" which made me so proud to be an American in 2001 is no longer a unifying point of view.  Now it's an "elite" point of view. :(I agree wholeheartedly that the TSA is nowhere near as morally objectionable, but it's pretty a bad (and continual) fiscal investment for what it provides.</comment>

<comment>"promises of government-produced comfort and safety has led to this"Please tell me, with a GOP primary where the "hot" issues are building a wall around the lower 48 and tattooing ID numbers on Muslims, you see the irony in your statement.</comment>

<comment>And so long as that authoritarianism manifests itself as preventing non-citizens from getting into America where they can kill us, I have no issues whatsoever with that.  It's only when it takes the form of squashing rights of citizens that I have an issue with it.</comment>

<comment>Preventing non citizens from getting to America? So no tourists then? No students? No visiting scholars? No business travelers? Zero immigration from anywhere? Are you barking mad?</comment>

<comment>That's right!  If anyone should be having the right to killing Americans ... It's Americans!</comment>

<comment>And that is exactly what they say. Just yesterday on NPR they were talking about the radicalism of French nationals who were second generation immigrants -just like they portray terrorists and criminals here- because making the point someone is a hyphen something insults certain segments of the population.</comment>

<comment>NOT TRUE ITS THE SOCIALIST OF THE PROGRESSIVE SIDE THAT HAS FOUGHT THIS SO HARD TO KEEP--THOSE LOVING FREEDOM KNOWS FREEDOM IS NOT WITHOUT A PRICE--</comment>

<comment>A story being printed without getting the full facts first. Oh what a surprise. Sensational headlines are far more important than getting the truth out there. It makes for better coverage for Fox News and other right wing T.V and talk radio to talk about 24/7. Seeing as they never let facts get in the way of any story they cover this will have made their day.</comment>

<comment>The Fox model is spreading throughout the media.  Actual journalism is becoming extinct and has been replaced by "analysis" from "experts".  Or, as it is called in the reality-based world, propaganda from shills.</comment>

<comment>Don't you think it speaks volumes that the problem isn't that they were wrong about her talking about violent jihad it was merely they were wrong about where she was talking about it?</comment>

<comment>Well the criticism was that DHS didn't screen readily available public social media, so it is significant to learn that it was not in fact public.</comment>

<comment>I have a much broader criticism of DHS which is that they let terrorists in and fail to remove the ones that radicalize once they're here (like the Boston Bombers who Russia warned us about)</comment>

<comment>Most national and intentional reporting of big stories evolves over time, esp. given the 24-hour nonstop news cycle that doesn't sleep or wait for every fact to be double confirmed like in the old pre-internet newspaper days.</comment>

<comment>The worst part is that Cruz, et al.  will never drop this talking point.  No matter how many times the falsity is explained.</comment>

<comment>I think you're missing the real problem, which is that SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT VIOLENT JIHAD and we let her in, not about whether her jihadist comments were public or private.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie said in the GOP debate "King Hussein of Jordan has a friend in me" Glad to hear it, but since he died in 1999, you might aswell be a friend of the ACTUAL king, Abdullah II. Almost all of them acused Obama of allowing Russia  going into Syria. I'm not sure what role did the then 10 yo Barack Obama played when Hafez Al-Assad granted the USSR a base in Tartus , in 1971. What am i sure is that facts don't matter. In the Social Media age, anyone can have it's own alternate reality, shielded from "facts", that's how Alex Jones et al are making a killing in the market for stupid.</comment>

<comment>I love that the "misleading" part isn't the part where she talked about violent jihad prior to our Government letting her into the Country, it was merely that she talked about it in private messages and not public ones.  In other words, stereotype validated and on point and another example of bad American border policy resulting in more dead Americans.  Seriously, end all immigration now from everywhere.  330 million people is plenty.</comment>

<comment>End all immigration because one jihadi slipped through?</comment>

<comment>Vetting, young Jedi.</comment>

<comment>No, end all immigration because we have 330 million people and the benefits aren't worth the risks anymore.</comment>

<comment>One? Najibullah Zazi, Ramy Zamzam, Aman Hassan Yemer, Daood Sayed Gilani, Ahmed Abdullah Minni…Do you want other types of crimes? Or what about fraud? Or what unlikely to be a positive role model? What is enough to think ahead and not assume people only have angels talking to them.</comment>

<comment>You know...people of all ethnic varieties commit crimes. Limiting immigration is not crime control.</comment>

<comment>You are correct, all phenotypes have angels and devils but values tend to meet culture (fair play being one) and the point was to point out there had been more than one terrorist that made it in. I forgot to look up the Boston bombers, not, they were young when coming in.</comment>

<comment>But the knucklehead gang you listed were either born here or came as kids. They are thus considered home grown, not jihadis when they came over. And that includes the Boston bombers. They were kids who radicalized while here. Unless we can read minds of kids at immigration, we can't predict these events.</comment>

<comment>Her husband was born in Illinois and was plotting terrorism before he ever met her.</comment>

<comment>Fantastic, so my immigration policy would have eliminated 50% of the San Bernadino attackers from being in the Country.  Except in fact it would have prevented even more, because his mother was a Pakistani immigrant, making him the radicalized second generation we speak so often about.</comment>

<comment>We just need to build a yuge wall around Illinois. Problem solved.</comment>

<comment>Ending all immigration is a much more acceptable policy than just stopping Muslim immigration.</comment>

<comment>There is no perfect security. The Federal government can't determine in advance what every single person trying to get into this country might someday do. All they can do is search for traces of criminality and assess risk.The US has 12,000 or so homicides a year, nearly all perpetrated by US citizens born and raised here. Very few legal immigrants have committed terrorism here. We have to stop thinking we can reduce immigration risk to zero.</comment>

<comment>Move those goal posts all around. Holy hell.</comment>

<comment>So let's not add to that hideous high number of homegrowns with imported psychopaths welcomed by incompetent government employees and laws designed for the 1950s.</comment>

<comment>We have let in 750,000 refugees since 9/11. We ahve had around 6 domestic terrorist attacks. Chill out.</comment>

<comment>Why does the crime rate soar among second-generation immigrants compared with their foreign-born peers?  …  Second-generation immigrants are just “catching up” with the rest of us, claims Bianca E. Bersani, a sociologist at the University of Massachusetts-Boston.Pew Hispanic ResearchLack of education = more likely to commit crimesGuess who does the worse in our education system?Even if you were right (very few is relative, any victim would tell you that) we still have to worry about MORE crime from a source that is simply policy or lack of policy enforcement.</comment>

<comment>So we should prevent Hispanic immigrants because the kids they have here might statistically be more prone to crime?</comment>

<comment>Points based system for all.</comment>

<comment>Like Canada?OK, but they don't assign points to war refugees. They end up with a lot of rich Asian immigrants. And they just let in a bunch of Syrians.</comment>

<comment>It's their country and, if they screw up, they have enough positive aggregate immigration that the nation stays ahead just like Australia or New Zealand even when making mistakes. Integration for educated people, swoosh... well, almost swoosh.</comment>

<comment>The incorrect NYT story is not the "driver" of fright-wing calls for more gov't surveillance. It's just a convenient excuse for more pandering and demagoguery. Consider the bogus Planned Parenthood videos. Even after those videos have been thoroughly debunked we still have politicians and anti-abortionists citing them as rational for more restrictions on a woman's right to chose her own health care. So the fear of the moment is immigrant jihadists, even though virtually all recent terrorist attacks have been by natural born citizens. Sorry, facts will not deter the bedwetters (as the very conservative Richmond Times Dispatch so rightly called them.)</comment>

<comment>All news stories evolve as investigations move forward, both governmental /law enforcement and by reporters. The relevant fact is that this terrorist jihadi immigrant did post on social media her desire to commit violent acts of destruction against the U.S. but was allowed into the country with next to no vetting under the insanely wide open fiancé/cupid visa program that needs to be shuttered. Oh, and the other relevant facts is that all the victims are still dead or injured.</comment>

<comment>The victims are, indeed, still dead. As are the 7000 Americans who died yesterday, the 7000 who will die today and so on. We need to collectively unwind ourselves from our fetal position and focus on what's really scary, like Donald Trump getting elected.</comment>

<comment>My point is there a few or no members of the Israeli Knesset pushing for new mass migrations of Syrian Muslim migrants, giving student visas to Saudi and Pakistani Islamists to attend flight school in Israel as was done here in the USA to the likes of Mohamed Ata and his crew.</comment>

<comment>The issue is that you want to ignore hate groups. Islam is a hate group. The Syrians are fleeing a mess that they created. </comment>

<comment>It would be a flagrant violation of the privacy rights of an undocumented alien/refugee for U.S. authorities to inquire about his/her social media activity.Shame on the NY Times for contributing to the Islamaphobia sweeping the West and kudos to President Obama for pointing out how misguided Americans are who link the recent incident in San Bernardino to Islam.</comment>

<comment>There is so much wrong with this statement, that I don't even know where to begin.</comment>

<comment>When will we learn that ordinary Americans shouldn't have political rights and that only the properly trained elites make our political decisions?</comment>

<comment>"But by Thursday, the Times admitted it had gotten parts of the story wrong. Tashfeen Malik had not posted publicly about violent jihad before moving to the U.S. Instead, according to the FBI, she had written about violent jihad only in private messages—not public posts. The Times changed its story, issued a correction, and endured a par­tic­u­larly bru­tal pub­lic flog­ging at the hands of its public editor.  That correction, however, came far too late to put the genie back in the bottle."Good heavens.  Why on earth would anyone need to put that "genie" back in the bottle?What's truly shocking is that this female was engaging in jihadist talk online, and was allowed in to kill even with a fake address, and then in the face of all this, it came out that in Obama's world, they don't even monitor the social media of Muslims because it would be too invasive to do that to Muslims, and Obama is married to his political correctness (but PC with regard only to Muslims evidently - as Snowden showed us, the rest of us are very monitored)!"A Mc­Cain aide ex­pressed a sim­il­ar view. “The fact re­mains that the Obama admin­is­tra­tion has clearly de­clined to re­view so­cial me­dia when con­duct­ing back­ground checks of for­eign­ers seek­ing to enter the United States—a policy that leaves us with a dan­ger­ous gap in in­tel­li­gence that could make us vulnerable to an­oth­er at­tack,” the aide said."</comment>

<comment>I personally prefer to be around people who are unlikely to try to kill my family or myself. I do not care to what or how they pray, as long as they do not think that their God wants them to stab or explode everyone who does not share their faith. Recent events suggest that the children of moderate or non practicing Muslims are more likely than any other group in the western world to be convinced by a youtube video that they need to go out and kill a bunch of people. That is just not acceptable behavior.</comment>

<comment>You, and most of us, wouldn't not think taking unnecessary risks is worth it but the media, soft hearts and little brain use and your local business bureau think it is worth it. No wonder some people support Trump and others are left with limited choices.</comment>

<comment>Is this article suggesting we should let in people who support Islamic terrorism? Or that we shouldn't look at prospective immigrants' social media posts?Both seem to be very foolish ideas. And it is, in fact, less than a ringing endorsement of Jeh Johnson and Obama himself, that a recent immigrant (who so clearly had no wish to assimilate) was involved in such spectacularly violent and heartless acts.Just a thought, someone whose dress, comportment, and lifestyle indicates they'd prefer to be raiding a Bedouin village, wielding a scimitar on their Ghazala, than living in 21st century California might deserve a bit more scrutiny than they're currently getting. </comment>

<comment>The terrorists will probably get around to it anyway. While I do support doing more to stop potential terrorists from entering our natiion, tougher surveillance on social media posts doesn't sound like the best of ideas. Y'all just gotta wonder, if and when we beat islamic extremists, who will be the next extremists? Just voicing an opinion contrary to the government will flag you as a potential terrorist? Gotta think long term, because these laws will not just go away with islamists if we beat them. I still like Trump's proposal more, and Cruz's original proposal in the Senate (stopping muslims from CERTAIN countries entering the nation) even more. This seems too orwellian for my tastes.</comment>

<comment>Okay, so the Times story was wrong, and it's being used to promote a policy that wouldn't have prevented the San Bernardino shooter from entering the country.But, at the end of the day, so what?  I'm assuming that State or DHS * already* check up on public social media presence by those wishing to enter the US,  and if not, they probably *should* be doing that, so what is the harm in requiring that?</comment>

<comment>So, what exactly is the difference between someone saying they are going to kill me in a private conversation as opposed to, say, a public notation--except for the part where I'm...dead either way? At the point of being alive and able to discuss this...I'd rather know and off them first. Sorry if you've missed the finer point wherein I don't really care what platform my impending death is vocalized on.</comment>

<comment>Can we please stop discussing muslim immigration?  With Ramadi recaptured and safe, with Mosul to be recaptured next and ISIS contained, the Syrian refugees have a place to settle, and can remain in the part of the world they want to be.</comment>

<comment>Anything that makes it more difficult for foreign undesirables to infiltrate our nation and poison our wells is fine by me. We need to decelerate our population growth anyway.</comment>

<comment>The seminal question is: what is the primary role of government? Is it to protect the people? Or is it to protect the moral standards of the nation? In the case of a war against a vicious and determined enemy, the historic response has been to protect the people. During WWII, no German or Japanese were allowed to immigrate.  There have been other restrictions over the years for the same reason.Now we are in WWIII, with western Democracy, law and values pitted against the Muslim fanatics. This has already been a vicious war with hundreds of thousands killed and we might include not only the 3,000 killed on 9/11 but many others since then.Should the government do everything possible to protect the people or should it take the moral high road, allow in many people from war-torn countries some of whom will inevitably become terrorists or their children will? --and also accept that there will be a certain undetermined amount of terrorism that might have prevented but we chose the alternative?</comment>

<comment>IT SEEMS THAT THIS POST SEEKS TO SAY HOW WE WERE WRONG TO DEMAND THIS LOGICAL STEP .
