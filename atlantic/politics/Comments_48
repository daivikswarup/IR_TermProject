<comment>As a resident of NJ, I can assure you that Christie is not only a terrible candidate but a terrible governor.  He has accomplished nothing during his tenure.  Literally.  Nothing.  I challenge anyone to name a single accomplishment.  I will give him props for telling Rand Paul to fnck off when Congress debated giving NJ aid after Superstorm Sandy.  Other than that, though, his tenure as governor has been a train wreck, and I draw solace from the fact that one way or another, NJ will soon see the rather ample back of this hack.</comment>

<comment>So who do you like, kenny? "Gay American" McGreevy? Goldman Sachs CEO Corzine?</comment>

<comment>Ooh, you called my "kenny."  In other words, ya got nuthin'.In any event, McGreevey's personal life aside, what was wrong with his governorship?  Corzine, while not great - which is why he lost to Christie, of course - was not actively harmful to the state, as is Christie.  In the case of the latter, it's like he *wants* to fail.  "Hey, we have an opportunity to more tightly integrate our state to the economic center of the world, *and* it's going to be paid for by the Feds, but, nah, I think I'll kill the ARC project."</comment>

<comment>if anyone knew all about Christie the way citizens of his state do, he would never get a spot on the debate stage.</comment>

<comment>Same could have been said about Scott Walker, too, though.</comment>

<comment>I'm actually surprised he didn't last longer.  Although Not Ready for Primetime, Walker at least had some real conservative credentials, right?  Christie doesn't even seem to have that.</comment>

<comment>FOR SALE: Scott Walker's Campaign Bus*note: will only run for two months*As for Christie...does anybody in NJ like the guy?</comment>

<comment>his unfavorables even among NJ Republicans have skyrocketed over the past year or so.  Christie could not carry New Jersey in a general election now, probably not even against Sanders, much less Hillary.</comment>

<comment>I'm curious, how is Walker "more conservative" than Christie.</comment>

<comment>let's see, Walker cut his budget more, cut taxes, didn't hug Obama, succeeded in destroying his public unions, and is more anti-immigration than Christie.  Seem like enough?</comment>

<comment>And he got driven out of the Republican presidential race for his policies.Even his own party hates Walker. The only ones who like him are his big money backers. When they give up on him, and they will, he will be gone - to jail probably.</comment>

<comment>Thanks,  I'm a bit curious about how people are defining "conservative," since everyone seems to be stressing different elements of conservatism.</comment>

<comment>I'm not even a conservative, that's just how it looks from over here.</comment>

<comment>Amen. I dislike those labels because the candidates twist themselves into pretzels when they run for president. Example: A person of good will might object to abortion AND capital punishment based on a single principle. People used to look into the mirror and see either a Republican or a Democrat. Now, if they are ill-tempered shits who need a scapegoat  when life is not a rose garden, they decide they are Republicans and adopt all-reactionary points of view.</comment>

<comment>Hugging Obama was a political calculation. Conventional wisdom says it backfired. I don't know.</comment>

<comment>Exactly Christie is going knowhere just media spin. NJ residents know all about him.</comment>

<comment>Intelligent response. Christie is a lousy GOP governors; therefore, kenrockthefirst must love the lousy Democratic governors.</comment>

<comment>I don't want an obnoxious bully who is a liar. He lied about pension reform, bridge gate common core, planned parenthood and the Sandy recovery just to name a few. You can take Christie and shove him where the sun doesn't shine.</comment>

<comment>You want me to shove Christie up your ass? Why?</comment>

<comment>You seem to like him since your brought up Corzine and "gay"McGreevy. If you like Christie you take him.  As far as I am concerned he is scum! </comment>

<comment>I know! I can't wait for Sweeney to be elected governor. All the problems of NJ will be solved, just like they were when Corzine was in office. Oh, happy 2017! I can't wait for my taxes to go up, up, and away!</comment>

<comment>As I recall, Sweeney was a very competent interim governor after McGreevey stepped down.In any event, your b!tching about Sweeney supports to my assertion, i.e. that you cannot cite a single accomplishment by Christie.</comment>

<comment>Both Sweeney and Cody were good interim Governors.  And both decent during their stints in the legislature.</comment>

<comment>My bad, I meant Cody.</comment>

<comment>He hugged Obama against the wishes of his own party. Does that count?</comment>

<comment>No.He wanted the federal money for his drowned state.Of course, if he was a pure conservative he would have turned down the money and let his state rot - like he does with every other aspect of his administration.</comment>

<comment>I'm interested in why you feel so convinced that Christie's tenure as governor has been such a train wreck, not having offered any examples.If you can, I would also like to know how his awfulness compares to his predecessors, in terms of actual policy results.</comment>

<comment>Do you have access to google? It shouldn't be hard to find the fact that New Jersey has seen 5 credit downgrades since Christie took office, and the state faces a yawning budget chasm. ($807 million.)  See his reduction of the Exxon settlement, allowing them to get off with years of environmental destruction which will be paid for instead by state citizens. You could see how educators have been vilified, how pension funds have been invaded, how he plans to privatize state water. (Yep, after Flint.) And how Sandy victims have yet to receive even the money they were promised. You could see how the unemployment rate has risen against the national average, and NJ has more home foreclosures than any state in the country. Basically, you could see how well Christie has done for big banks, and how badly he's done for everyone else. Most people outside the state only know him as a bully whose subordinates were so petty they blocked bridge lanes for days. But there is much, much more.</comment>

<comment>Have to thank you for the encouragement; I've turned up some interesting reading.I have found no evidence to support that NJ public pensions have been "invaded." What I have found instead was that previous governors and legislatures have consistently expanded pension obligations, without concomitant increases in contributions, to purchase political support, generating funding shortfalls which the ratings agencies cite as their primary reasons for their respective downgrades.While we're on that point, it's worth noting that people who want to attack Christie's performance love to cite the raw number of downgrades NJ received, without acknowledging the fact that there are three credit ratings agencies which usually move in unison, so the numbers are essentially triple-counted. That number is 9, by the way, not 5, while we're having a moment of honesty.  And hey, since you utterly ignored my question about how any of this compares to his predecessors (what a surprise), Christie only just beat out the previous record for downgrades held by one of his Democratic predecessors, Mr. Jim McGreevey, with six downgrades that took only half the time - during economic boom years, no less.I have also found that Christie has been attempting to work with an openly hostile, Democratic legislature and unions which are loath to budge on their added perks, fair, adequately funded, or not. Perhaps trying to achieve budgetary solvency is your idea of Christie "vilifying" unions, but that doesn't wash. Especially considering that Democratic administrations don't seem to have fared much better in  negotiations in the past.Sounds like Christie's trials and tribulations in fact bear many similarities to those of everyone's other favorite executive, President Obama. Huge budget problems? Whatever - he inherited those. No progress? Blame it on a hostile legislature. Poor growth, high unemployment? Well of course - he took office in the midst of the worst recession in 80 years. Not responsible. Man, this is easier than I thought!</comment>

<comment>Briefly, Christie on pension invasion.http://articles.philly.com/201...Chrstie vilifying unions, specifically teachers http://www.nj.com/politics/ind...And I have no idea what you're trying to say in your last paragraph. Under Obama, the federal deficit has shrunk, nationally the employment rate has diminished. The opposite of Christie's state.</comment>

<comment>He vetoed a vitally needed new tunnel for the PATH commuter trains to NYC that every other official, elected or appointed, up through the president, has been desperate to see go through.</comment>

<comment>New Jersey like it's sister New York state or further west  Illinois ,Michigan or just about any N.E. eastern seaboard state or large city's  like Baltimore ...or in the Midwest Chicago  you care to mention are  corrupt train wrecks and most of them are liberal Democrat failures even Mass. with it's failed liberal policy's and widespread heroin addiction !You would think Mexifornia would learn something from all that but they are also headed for a HUGE train wrecksent from the left coast </comment>

<comment>If I lived in NJ I'd be major po'd about that imbecile deal with Exxon! He should have been lynched for that deal alone.</comment>

<comment>Yes, among all of the terrible, questionable things Christie's done, that one was pretty bad, especially because it was so nakedly obvious that there was a quid pro quo involved.</comment>

<comment>killing the ARC tunnel was pretty wretched too</comment>

<comment>And that was the very first thing he did in office:  a giant FU to the commuters of NJ.</comment>

<comment>Don't think he felt any.</comment>

<comment>Based on his tone-deaf comments regarding his meatheaded vow to crack down on cannabis (in any context), it appears that he is just another tool who has been purchased by the Pharmaceutical industry (dozens of major drug companies are based in NJ).</comment>

<comment>even though New Jersey passed medical MJ into law before he was even elected, Christie has kept adding requirements and fees so after 8 years there are still only 2 dispensaries in the state.  He is stalling it based on nothing but his own personal distaste.</comment>

<comment>He doesn't want the citizens getting the munchies. Less goodies for him...</comment>

<comment>Expect the teachers union to spam up this article as well.  They despise him because he took away their gravy train and they have lots of free time.</comment>

<comment>Comeback? Doesn't that require polling in the top three in any given state?</comment>

<comment>Fat and mean.... not going to sell. He was very mean to Marco Rubio and that will hurt him. He will not survive past New Hampshire.</comment>

<comment>You are 100% right Nikato.  He wasted all his venom for nothing.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie was quite right in the last debate to call out Marco Rubio and his canned speech. Rubio thinks that if he mentions Obama's name fifty million times in a few seconds that will catapult him into the White House. Well Rubio is dead wrong. He's not only cunning he knows nothing only the few things he bones up on and repeats over and over no matter what the question may be he'll slip in his memorized lines somewhere. Chris Christie himself likes to brag about how great he is as a governor, many in New Jersey hold a very different view! His fell down on the job over bridge-gate and Sandy. If he was such a great governor he should have known full well what was going on with the bridge debacle yet threw the people under him under the bus over that. As regards Sandy many people are still suffering so he has no claim to fame either about being ready on day one as all these GOP wannabees like to say!!</comment>

<comment>Christie's debate performance made an excellent case for why not to vote for Marco Rubio. It gave few reasons to vote for Chris Christie, however.</comment>

<comment>Nail, meet head.</comment>

<comment>Not really bc he should not talk with his record. I don't like,some of Rubio's views but he is better then Obama by far.</comment>

<comment>Everything he does now is useless. There is no redemption for him. The bridge scandal painted him just as he is: the true, ugly Christie. Very few people like him; even less than Curze, I mean Cruz.</comment>

<comment>Triumphant? If that's the word you want to use to describe handing the presidency to whichever democrat gets the nomination. The republicans instance on turning every debate into a shouting match is beyond tiresome. America is losing interest. IMO, Rubio may have had a fighting chance of actually becoming president if he had continued his trajectory and ran against Clinton or Sanders. Now if we still get Cruz or Trump or one of the other jokers, it's a done deal. But maybe this little exchange will get Christie polling from 3% to about 7% for the next week...congrats.</comment>

<comment>If Mr. Rubotio couldn't handle an attack from Christie - which Christie had been making at rallies for over a week - what makes you think he could've handled a general election campaign against the unified Democratic Party?</comment>

<comment>That's probably true and Rubio would have faltered at another point, but at least it would be at the hands of a democrat. My point is more that the republicans seem particularly hellbent on cannibalization. Watching candidates hovering above 0%, grasping at straws, while self destructing and bringing the party down with them. All par for the course, but these debates are starting to resemble more of a Jerry Springer episode.</comment>

<comment>I feel the need to quote Richard Nixon:"The problem with Republicans is when they get into trouble, they start acting like cannibals."</comment>

<comment>That is the identical problem Trump has..'he cannot handle attacks or criticisms...He is the worst!</comment>

<comment>Christie isn't going to be president or vice president or anything of the above. He's going back to NJ, where the residents of the state will beat him up for coming back because they beat him up for not being there. There's a local radio station that does a monthly Ask the Governor call-in show with him and he's always impressive with the answer. He's knows what's going on in the state. Still, he's made too many enemies of the union folks and the people who sleep with them, so he's not very liked in NJ. He'll return for a lame-duck governance where it will be a stand-off between the do-nothing legislature and the bully governor.</comment>

<comment>Christy is not going to be President. He knows that. He is just staying away from NJ while the Bridge-gate investigation continues. He is hoping that issue will resolve itself.</comment>

<comment>Domo arigato, Mr. Rubotio.</comment>

<comment>Cute.  I've started to call him the Marcobot.  But this is more topical. ;)</comment>

<comment>The Trump and Cruz campaigns are still celebrating. Rubotio no longer got away with empty rhetoric, but folded under pressure just like the empty shell that he is.</comment>

<comment>Rubio's numbers are up and Christies are down.....</comment>

<comment>Rubiobot is dropping like a rock...he's down to 7% and sliding.</comment>

<comment>The primaries are like watching crabs trying to climb out of a bucket. The minute one gets close to escape velocity, those who have little chance try to bring him down anyway. Sanders is never going to win the nomination, so he's just hurting the inevitable Nominee, to what end - so the Republicans win?Likewise, Carson, Christie and Kasich have basically no chance of winning so are just trying to ruin the GOP candidate with the best chance (in theory, Bush still has a chance, but if this actually looked likely, Cruz and Rubio would turn on him until that was no longer so. Mind you, having 16 candidates representing at best 3 electorates (conservative, moderate and disaffected Republicans) makes no sense in the first place.</comment>

<comment>"Sanders is never going to win the nomination,"They said that about (twice elected) President Barack Hussein Obama at the time also. And last time I looked at his picture he was a black man. I think he still is.</comment>

<comment>And I see the media saying one of them can win NH or be in second. No way that happens I think, may be same 3 again with trump winning NH I think but will be close, Rubio or Cruz may still be second or third but it's winner take all that state.</comment>

<comment>Would he be the fattest prez in history, or was Taft larger?</comment>

<comment>Supposedly Taft peaked at 340 lbs while he was president.  Christie is estimated to have lost over 100 lbs in the last couple years (he had lap band surgery a few years ago) but the guy's still pretty big so he might have had Taft beat at his peak.</comment>

<comment>He needs to get his $$ back on the lap band deal, I think.thing is, if you still eat too much, the lap band thing will never, ever work...</comment>

<comment>Supposedly he's lost over 100 lbs.  Not sure what he spent but most obese people would love those kind of results.</comment>

<comment>He does NOT look any thinner to me.  I had roux en Y bypass and did lose 100 pounds and my neighbors thought I was dying.  The lap band either causes bad GERD, in which case it comes out, or it isn't tightened enough, on which case people cheat.  About 50 % have failed like that, which is why it is out of favor.  Christie's is probably too loose and he's cheating.  He needs to do the bypass, or the newer sleeve surgery if he's really serious.</comment>

<comment>I think Christie is shorter, so BMI might be greater.</comment>

<comment>From a quick scan of the internet I'm seeing 6'0" for Taft and 5'11" for Christie.  So they're pretty close if those figures are to be believed.</comment>

<comment>Maybe return to the cut-throat law profession.  His arrogance has no place in the White House.  That said, he did well to out Rubio as the lightweight he is.</comment>

<comment>At best, he made a case for why nominating Rubio would be a mistake. But no one watching that debate suddenly changed their mind about Christie. Bush, Kasich, Rubio and Christie are all auditioning for the party establishment. They've pretty much conceded the I-hate-the-party ground to Trump and Cruz. The only way any of these guys emerge as a real threat to Trump is if the others drop out. If you add up the poll numbers of Bush, Kasich, Rubio, and Christie, it would exceed Trump's. As badly as Rubio did, he's not going anywhere. That means whoever of these four does the best on Tuesday, the party will rally behind him even if he sounds scripted.</comment>

<comment>Half of them will be finished after NH I think, the ones the media is talking up this week. </comment>

<comment>Christie is a loud-mouthed and gluttonous bully who would run the US like a mafia don.  They should have thrown his fat arse off that bridge, what an A-hole.</comment>

<comment>So what do you think about Christie?</comment>

<comment>Loner status thus explained.</comment>

<comment>IMHO,   the mainstream candidates are going to come back. Trump and Sanders will get their days in the sun, but ultimately people will come to realize that the wall and free college are a pie in the sky with  the government we have. Much as conservatives call Obama a liberal from my standpoint he has been about as moderate as you can be.And we will continue that way, for better or worse.</comment>

<comment>Historians will regard Obama very well.  They will wonder about the talk that he is some sort of crazy leftist and conclude that at least some of the hysteria was about his brown skin.Don't you think the GOP, under a Cruz presidency with both houses,gets rid of the filibuster and goes for broke dismantling as much of the New Deal as they dare?I'm waiting for huge tax cuts, and the resulting talk that the deficit doesn't matter.  Then we will have gone full circle.</comment>

<comment>This is the year when the GOP's loudmouths and bullies take center stage.  Christie is both and I'm surprised that it's taken him until now to get traction.</comment>

<comment>"Sniffle, sniffle....stop bullying me, I can't stand up for myself, I'm too much of a wimp....sniffle....sniffle."</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie is a bully and hack with a record of past bullying.   Rubio is not  a good debater or he would have brought up Chritie's bullying and hacking tactics that led to Bridgegate  as his experience but unfortunately Rubio got stuck in the mud and lost that opportunity</comment>

<comment>I think Rubio handled it perfectly, Christie looked like a bully and it has only hurt him in the polls...</comment>

<comment>You GOPers are such a bunch of pu$$ies."You're a bully! I'm going to run to my mommy and tell on you!"</comment>

<comment>No I don't think so.  Rubio dropped the ball and allowed himself to be bullied.</comment>

<comment>He was not ready and you can tell, I'd of said let's talk about you record gov. It sucks. He did miss a big chance to bury Christie. And the whole I'm a Gov so that makes me more qualified is total b.s. as well.</comment>

<comment>It is more than that.  Rubio is not grade 6 anymore in front of a classroom.Christie is uttering BS because his job approval is pretty low and it is all routed in his outright bullying tactics""Christie's job approval falls to record lows in N.J., poll shows""http://www.nj.com/politics/ind...</comment>

<comment>Bully?You sound like a little girl. Grow a pair.</comment>

<comment>Christie is a bully and a hack.  Bridgegate was about him showing his skills of bullying and willingness to screw people's lives for sake of political hacking to show them who is the  political mafia boss.He has balls to start wars and conflicts, targeting his apposition.</comment>

<comment>You must be a gay little sissy.</comment>

<comment>Keep posting diatribe..</comment>

<comment>sissy, don't make me bully you.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is probably thinking up a good answer about now. Then he will have to consult with his handlers about how to say it.</comment>

<comment>Probably that is true but I think it is over for him</comment>

<comment>I always thought 30 million Green Card, unlimited family reunification, immediate legalization Rubio would be shoved down our throats by the Establishment. But if not him, then who?</comment>

<comment>Why do you hate foreigners so much?  Do you actually know any?</comment>

<comment>He´s just a troll.</comment>

<comment>Nicely written, Molly Ball.</comment>

<comment>This makes Dem hearts go pitty-pat.  I don't think people get elected president once they've had that deer-in-the-headlights look on them.  I was surprised Christie didn't tell Rubio to go have a quick sip of water....</comment>

<comment>Buffalo Bob the King of BS.</comment>

<comment>Christie certainly did come back but it may have been too much.Christie's attack on Rubio may have reminded viewers of what they do not like about Christie which is his penchant to telling people to "shut up" and "the hug" which showed him to be entirely self-interested.Ironically his attack may have helped two other governors: Kasich and Bush.We'll see tomorrow.</comment>

<comment>I agree.  I think Bush and Kasich both benefit more.</comment>

<comment>Being the loudmouth is a role Trump stole from him</comment>

<comment>Actually Trump's been a loudmouth his whole life which is why he has no friends.</comment>

<comment>The loud-mouthed bully bit is a N.Y.-N.J. poltical staple, but it doesn´t tend to fly too well in other parts of the country.</comment>

<comment>in fact, its wearing out in NY NJ also</comment>

<comment>No, guys who grew in NYC were not wimps like Trump who chickened out of commitments (military service, wives, money he owed people, debates).</comment>

<comment>He's not back until the indictments have landed.In any case, the Governor Soprano act doesn't play well outside of Jersey.</comment>

<comment>the Governor Soprano act isn't working inside Jersey anymore, either.</comment>

<comment>If he and Hillary are the nominees, the grand juries could get interesting.  Hey, why wait until they are elected before naming special prosecutors?</comment>

<comment>Because Hilary hasn't done anything? After all, we have the Republicans' own admission of that fact.</comment>

<comment>Christie definitely did us all a service by nailing Rubio as a pre-programmed, scripted high-school debate kid.It was truly funny how Rubio could not help himself - he kept on regurgitating the script verbiage even as Christie kept calling him on it.</comment>

<comment>Its doubtful its going to help Christie much.Of course in this race just staying in might be enough.  I think Trump has peaked and the other morons will blow up on their own</comment>

<comment>Leaving behind whom, Ted Cruz?  No way Bernie wins in November.  HRC might win if she isn't indicted, but I think we are looking at President Cruz.  God help us.</comment>

<comment>HRC hasn´t done anything to be indicted for, so don´t sweat the Cruz thing.</comment>

<comment>I'm not so sure.  I hope the leaders have a plan B and that plan B isn't Joe Biden, not that I don't love Joe.  The dem bench is terrible.</comment>

<comment>Cruz makes everyone he speaks to recoil in disgust</comment>

<comment>The real raw meat eating Right loves him because he is so "pure."  My guess is 25% of voters have no idea who he is.  He will tack to the center a little once nominated.  Most republicans will hold their nose and vote for him, as at least he's not HRC.  Those people who have never heard of him figure it's time for a change.  He wins narrowly and we have the most reactionary government since Herbert Hoover.</comment>

<comment>I am willing to bet that if Cruz gets the nomination the other GOP senatos(except Mike Lee) won't vote for him. They might even vote for Hillary.</comment>

<comment>I've never been able to take Rubio seriously. Far too green and callow.</comment>

<comment>Did you vote for our present emperor?  Of course, he wasn't green.  He was red.</comment>

<comment>Well ain't you the clever one.</comment>

<comment>Too much foam when he was a jovencito.</comment>

<comment>Rubio is an empty suite.</comment>

<comment>It was entertaining but it didn't help Christie at all, and probably hurt him. He's lost 2 points in the CNN poll since the debate..</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie's return may only be due to him calling out Marco Rubio on his never ending wash rinse repeat lines. Christie's own record will come into question as time goes on should he move further up the ladder. Let's see how calm cool and collected he will be once others start coming at him full force with facts that Christie may want to ignore right now.</comment>

<comment>Honestly, I don't even know that there is such a thing as "Chris Christie's return" at this point. So far, the pundits have done a miserable job of extrapolating their impression of the candidates' debate performances to the reactions of actual voters, and this is truer of Rubio than any other candidate in the race.So far, almost none of the critical acclaim showered (unjustly) on Rubio's previous debate performances has been reflected in his actual poll numbers, so it's by no means certain that the pundits' (finally accurate) evaluation of Rubio's last debate as a disaster is predictive of anything at all.It's even possible that the NH electorate will have the opposite reaction than the one the analysts expect, and will rally to Rubio as the "victim" of Christie's bullying.</comment>

<comment>Thank you. I kept thinking that all those praising the Wonderkid weren't watching the same debate as I was. Guy has never had any gravitas.</comment>

<comment>Christie isn't even on the ladder....</comment>

<comment>The headline says "triumphant," the content says "bittersweet."</comment>

<comment>No one is going to elect this blimp sized turd President.</comment>

<comment>Why not just critique Rubio's policies? He supports doubling legal immigration. He wants to draft our daughters to fight a 5-sided war in Syria. What's to like?</comment>

<comment>Marco Rubio gets really good jobs. We have heard a lot already about Rubio’s $800,000 advance for a very modest memoir about his formative years. And the billionaire auto dealer who donated $100,000 to Florida International University, where Rubio was hired as a visiting professor for $69,000.(Coincidence? No.)NBC News reported that Rubio worked less than 10 hours a week during his first semester at the teaching gig, missing three of his 10 classes.(See? No coincidence.)</comment>

<comment>no he doesn't ... get educated</comment>

<comment>When Christie went after Rubio, I couldn't help but picture a thought-bubble over Christie's head of Rubio as a roasted chicken.</comment>

<comment>Where was this guy for the past year?  Is he running for VP or 2020?</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure which debate Molly watched but Christie continues to lose support and is now trailing Carly Fiorina! I thought he looked desperate going after Marco repeatedly, but steering clear of Trump and Cruz. He's done....</comment>

<comment>Marcobot Rubiosoft is freefalling in the internal polls.He's at 7% and falling like a rock.</comment>

<comment>Glad you have your own internal polls, but in the CNN poll of polls he's up 2% to 15%  and Christie has fallen below 5%</comment>

<comment>You might want to get an update.Those are tracking polls that started before the debate.He started free falling on Sunday and today the news is horrific.</comment>

<comment>Dude its one click away...here's the link"Trump tops the GOP field with 31%, well ahead of Marco Rubio's 15%. Rubio has picked up four points since the previous New Hampshire Poll of Polls, the biggest change in the averages in the last week."http://www.cnn.com/2016/02/08/...</comment>

<comment>Do you have the snapshot of today's numbers?I do....and Rubiobot is at 7%.</comment>

<comment>Here is the latest poll....Rubio crashed into single digits on Sunday after the debate..Emerson College......http://media.wix.com/ugd/3bebb...</comment>

<comment>Wow. I don't put a lot of trust in these polls anyway but with this much volatility they seem to be totally meaningless. Voters in NH will be flipping coins or rolling dice on the way to the polls tomorrow to help them decide.</comment>

<comment>Really, you cherry pick 1 poll to make your point (and its Emerson College)  The CNN is an average of the more respected ( probably not Emerson College) polls. BTW, since we've been arguing Rubio has moved to 17% and Christie down to 4%. Sorry, his rhetoric didnt work...</comment>

<comment>The Atlantic is just like every other left-leaning news publication in it's fawning love affair with Chris Christie. Why? Because he is intrinsically a loser who can't win. He comes from a deep blue state that he will not carry in the general, and he is permanently tarnished by bridge-gate. Therefore they love to talk about him. He is entertaining, and charismatic - so he is good fluff to drone on about - from the perspective of cynical liberal journalism. His charisma and his power was forever destroyed by bridge-gate - only someone of irreproachable integrity can talk such tough smack the way he is and not come off as a bully or a blowhard. His integrity has been destroyed, so he is powerless now. Go away.</comment>

<comment>Absolutely! All Chris needs to "vault back in" is Dumbo's ears and some help from that "A Little Bit of Luck" guy from the NY State lottery!</comment>

<comment>Hillary and Bernie are still the worst candidates out there</comment>

<comment>Bernie's not bad...</comment>

<comment>It gets better the more I watch it.Marcobot Rubiosoft will go down in infamy.</comment>

<comment>"Chris Christie [was] a big man." Look. Just because you say this isn't a reference to his weight doesn't mean that it isn't exactly that. Your readers aren't stupid.</comment>

<comment>A month from now all of the governors will be gone.</comment>

<comment>This will be the high point of the Christie campaign.  He made Rubio look like an utter fool.   A public service,  in a way.</comment>

<comment>Gov. Christie is a big bully. He should be ashamed of himself, picking on that nice young Rubio boy like that.</comment>

<comment>I'll vote for Christi over Trump ,Bush,Rubio maybe even Cruz or shurely any Democrat  in a minute !</comment>

<comment>So you vote for losers.</comment>

<comment>The sharp Gov Christie merely pointed out a major flaw in the other candidate's robotic message and exposed it.Christie is solid, experienced. Hopefully he will stay in the race.True Rubio so youthful he looks like a ''Bernie 2016'' college supporter . . just kidding!</comment>

<comment>Still waaaaaay too fat to be elected president.</comment>

<comment>Yo sunny, that's not nice!Behave</comment>

<comment>So's Hillary Clinton. She is quite literally the elephant in the room that no one wants to look at.</comment>

<comment>Yet you fantasize about her every night.Why is that?</comment>

<comment>If I do it can only be  because I have a diseased mind with a sick predilection for fat and heinously ugly old ladies.</comment>

<comment>Headline: Christie's Triumphant ReturnSubhead: CAN Christies return? Analysis of article: Empty speculationI've got a bridge to sell the gullible Ms. Ball.</comment>

<comment>Christie is definitely a lot sharper than Rubio, and I'm glad he exposed the poser for what he is. However...this is a man who shut down the busiest bridge in the US, causing total gridlock in and around Ft. Lee, just to make a political point against the Democratic mayor. He should rightfully be in jail.</comment>

<comment>No... Christie is a jerk! I would stay home if Mr Big Mouth won the nomination!</comment>

<comment>So Chris Christie bullies Marco Rubio, and that makes him presidential? His performance at the debate seemed like a schoolyard fight. I lost all respect for him when he bullied that nurse, Kaci Hickox, back during the Ebola scare.I hope he loses big in New Hampshire. He's not a big man, he's just fat.</comment>

<comment>You can not like Christie but still applaud him making Rubio's flaws a bit more obvious.</comment>

<comment>Good point.But as we get close to voting I think it's important that we judge the candidates on more than just their performance in any one debate.Chris Christie was elected governor of New Jersey in 2009. Marco Rubio was elected senator from Florida in 2010. They've been campaigning for a year now. We have a lot to judge them on.Like their reactions to the Ebola scare. Chris Christie was a jerk about it, ignoring the medical science and locking up the nurse for no reason. Marco Rubio was sensible about it, noting that the nurse was a hero, while at the same time saying she should be quarantined if she showed symptoms.It seems like the elections are turning into something like American Idol, where one slipup can mean the end. Like Rick Perry with his "Oops." A man builds a record over a lifetime in office and then gets slammed for forgetting one small thing while in the spotlight? (Ted Cruz made a similar slipup this year, but it slipped by.)It's sad, too, that one of the drawbacks Chris Christie faces is his weight. I don't think he could get elected president simply because of that. Which is a shame.</comment>

<comment>good point i forgot about the nurse thing. nothing but a run of the mill, loud-mouthed bully from out east . . . no one wants to hear all that </comment>

<comment>The press loves them some chris christie. The public? not so much</comment>

<comment>Just auditioning for VP. </comment>

<comment>I don't think Christie would be on anyone's VP shortlist.he doesn't do 2nd fiddle or banana.</comment>

<comment>ya Christie knows how to get stuff done! mess with him and he'll cause your neighborhood a days-long traffic jam! that's the leadership we need!  sorry, no jersey kooks allowed </comment>

<comment>Get a grip Atlantic!</comment>

<comment>Watch him fall in tomorrow's election. He will be in single digits, probably at the very bottom.</comment>

<comment>I'd be perfectly happy to vote for Christie.  But polling data (even though lots of people lie) suggest quite strongly he can't win the south.    So I wish he'd kiss and make up and plan to be our next AG.</comment>

<comment>Christie has made some serious mistakes BUT he can talk your leg off!Perfect for Sec'y. of State!</comment>

<comment>I like the straight-talk of Chris Christie.  However, I don't think can win the nomination when Donald Trump is seen as the king of straight-talk.  In the general election, neither Trump or Christie appeals to the social conservative vote...31% of Americans according to Gallup.  A Republican without a good social conservative record will fail to draw the numbers needed to win the general election. That might not always be the case, but in 2016 it is an essential element to secure victory over the Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Christie criticizing Rubio for repeating the same lines over and over is like Hillary lecturing a nun about honesty or Sanders calling a 40 year old - old. Every single debate answer from Christie begins with the same 2 lines, "what we did in New Jersey" and "the difference between being a Governor and being a Senator". Who is the broken record robot now? The difference between Christie and Rubio is Rubio's statement was the truth. Christie's are outright lies or misrepresentations of his record as governor or a complete distortion of what it means to be a senator vs being a governor.  A governor deals with local politicians, local issues and has little to no national exposure. A senator is exposed daily to national intelligence, defense briefings and multiregional issues.  I'll take a senator over New York's little sister state any day.</comment>

<comment>Or I'm a Gov thing he says and it makes him,more qualified which is b.s. as well.</comment>

<comment>He has a horrible record as well, credit rating downgrades very high taxes, accepted Obama carr and common core in his state too. Rubio has better record being gov don't make u a good pres.</comment>

<comment>In fairness, he declined to set up a state healthcare exchange.  To his shame.</comment>

<comment>Nope Christie cannot. But like the bad seed he is, Christie is saying if I can't have it then nobody else can either. The big fella is a one man GOP demolition derby. The only time he speaks the truth is when he is trashing his fellow conservatives. And that is a lot of fun to watch.</comment>

<comment>Bridge-gate killed Christie. The big man "plowing the snow and solving problems" was found out to be a very little man deliberately bringing misery upon the people. Of course it has not been proven that Christie himself was involved, if only his chief lieutenants.Christie has as much chance to win the nomination as does Fiorina. He damaged Rubio badly, but he will not be the one profiting from the result.For me, I could never ever vote for Bridge-gate Christie.</comment>

<comment>Christie blew it a long time ago when called upon to run in 2012 against Romney and Obama. Too little too late.</comment>

<comment>Christie is a one-trick pony.  He beats up on people.  Works as a prosecutor, not so much as President.He just lucked out by finding a true horse's ass for a punching bag.</comment>

<comment>Allah bless Christie. May he signal the return of suffering and misery to the infidel nation of the United States.</comment>

<comment>Nice Eulogy. </comment>

<comment>Governor Fatso, who reminds so much of Ralph Kramden, will win about 5% of the vote.  He, along with Rubbero and the rest of the rabble will all drop out by the end of South Carolina.</comment>

<comment>Having read the piece, I still don't see what how his return is "triumphant". Aren't you putting the horse before the cart, hack liberal sycophant writer?</comment>

<comment>What a steaming pile of vile. The guy can't control his obesity, so how can he so pompously judge others?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I love it when morbidly obese man implies or explicitly states that someone is "weak."</comment>

<comment>christie has a picture of his "dick" on a milk carton, he hasn't seen it in twenty years</comment>

<comment>Gov Krispy Kreme has done our state no favors. Now privatizing water systems in NJ he will foreverbe enshrined in the miserable annals of political scumbaggery.</comment>

<comment>Morbidly obese describes both Christie's size and his personality. Intellectually he could shop in the boy's department. Steak fries (with cheese) and tacos that is his stronghold. If all a president needed to do is be morbidly obese and eat (or lie/cheat/bully on the rare occasions his mouth and hands are free of food), FAT-BOY  would win hands down. He is also your man, if you need a poster boy for morbid obesity as a natural method for birth control. Otherwise, Christie belongs in a circus side act next to the bearded woman showing his talent at an all you can eat buffet. Filled up with tacos you can be sure his intestines did not leave Cactus Jacks quietly.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie said this...."I support families and dual parenting. I believe that no parent should be prevented from seeing their child due to a perverse incentive for states. If this incentive is in fact having an effect on parental rights I would certainly address this issue while reforming social security. In New Jersey, I signed alimony reform legislation in 2014 to bring fairness to the system for all those involved. I would bring that same consideration to social security title IV D and family law reform as president."~ Chris Christie------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Love him or hate him, he said it.. so we need to back him up.At least just having the issues even uttered in a major U.S. Presidential campaign is a good thing. Even better if we follow it up and keep pushing the issues no matter who it was that actually said it. We do this until other candidates feel they could also get votes by taking on this cause as part of their campaign platform and/or policies if elected. Maybe soon they will all be arguing about who has the best family law reform policy and who fights for our rights the most. - I just want to get the dialogue started and get this issue the attention it deserves. - Any way possible.Mr. Christie is a presidential candidate who correctly understood and answered the question of if he would support social security title IV-D and family law reform. So far no other candidates seemed to understand or answer it correctly.. if at all. They seem to distort or flat out avoid the issue altogether. Chris Christie should capitalize on that. https://www.changepolitics.org...#chrischristie  #familylawreform</comment>

<comment>How Christie can personally attack Rubio with impunity and without recognizing his own vulnerability is beyond me.  But I suppose we will eventually "cross that bridge."   Or maybe not.</comment>

<comment>Chris Christie is a BULLY! </comment>
