<comment>So let's see how many poison pills the Republicans will stuff into the spending bill. Planned Parenthood? Loosening campaign spending even more? More home town pork?</comment>

<comment>"Loosening campaign spending even more?"They are trying to foreclose any new disclosure requirements for federal contractors.  Can't imagine why. . . .</comment>

<comment>What or who is fiscally irresponsible? Seems neither party cares about the national debt or who will end up paying for it, it's all about spending yet more money in order to win votes come election time... The Federal Government spends 3.4 Trillion dollars a year and let's not even talk about what our State and Local governments spend. But than again it's all Greek to me...!</comment>

<comment>Bdc, they lied to you about the impact of borrowing and our short term ability to pay down the debt.  They lied to you about the parallels between Greece and the US.  They lied so that you'd vote in Congressional elections.The Congressional elections are over now.  Maybe it's time to move on... until the 2016 elections, when they'll stuff your brain with yet more garbage. Or you could stop being such an easy mark.</comment>

<comment>But the downgrade of US bonds, thanks to "political instability", as the rating agencies put it, that was very real. Republican voters should file a class action lawsuit to get their congressmen reimbursing them in full.</comment>

<comment>"neither party..."  When has this been true?  Outrageous blindness couldn't produce a worse analysis.The HATE of the current President is what has united our Congress, and believe me, it sure isn't Democrats doing it.And by the way, please note:  EVERYTHING our governments buy, they buy from the private sector.  Drunken spending in the family destroys it.  Wild spending in the Congressional budget creates jobs, gets money flowing at low interest rates we should have been rebuilding the country.Instead, the Republican wealth is demanding interest hikes!  All that will do for ordinary people is raise the taxpayer share of debt service, currently pushed uip to $200 billion a year because Dubya never paid for Iraq or Afghanistan and these current guys pledged to never ever raise taxes.Lose the "neither party" meme.  It just ain't so.</comment>

<comment>Dubya received a budget surplus. Obama received a Great Depression. Do the Math.</comment>

<comment>Apparently the government shutdown threat is the new filibuster - to be applied to any and all legislation or program you don't like for whatever reason. It just loses all teeth when it is threatened for everything. It hasn't worked yet, it's just empty posturing now.</comment>

<comment>I'd say it's getting pretty OLD.The House has only a few major duties, which have nothing to do with immigration, war tactics, treaties, management of the Federal Reserve, or protecting the NRA.Among those duties are the passage of 12 budget bills that fund the government."Regular Order" means that each of those budget bills is marked up and debated in Committee, then brought to the floor for a vote.There are many members who can't tell you when that has happened.There are many members who don't care if it ever happens (they were elected to destroy the functioning of the government and cut everything including taxes.)The American people really could use a functioning government once more.But the Confederates and the TeaBirchers have enough strength to paralyze our whole legislative body.McConnell just destroys whatever life remains in the legislative policies.Malfeasance @ $174,000 a year.</comment>

<comment>The sad thing with the republican caucus is that these are literally the best people that the RNC can buy.</comment>

<comment>The so called Freedom Caucus will probably try to remove the first responders amendment and push for the Planned Parenthood restrictions, because that's what's important...</comment>

<comment>The Democrats are almost wishing they do. Both are non starters in the court of public opinion.</comment>

<comment>No one is wishing they do. We don't enjoy using peoples lives to play politics, that's a conservative's arena.</comment>

<comment>Shut down the government, stop the wars, stop the bombing, stop the drone strikes, stop the police from arresting people, open up the prisons and let everyone loose.Most of all, Democrats and Republicans - GO HOME, Get OUT of WASHINGTON.We don't need you or want you.Stop molesting Americans.</comment>

<comment>That comment is the ideological spirit of the Republican party as expressed by Jefferson, "That government is best which governs least, because its people discipline themselves."  Sadly Republicans these days only seem to exemplify that when a Democrat is President.</comment>

<comment>Jefferson was unfamiliar with government by gangsters.Royals were slightly more respectable.By a hair.</comment>

<comment>Ya, but they wore wigs.</comment>

<comment>What a bunch of barbarians</comment>

<comment>If only we had a pompous guy with a wig to rule us!</comment>

<comment>On the contrary, he was well familiar with it having suffered under the heavy handed rule of of George III.  You'll also note he was similarly fearful of "the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations".  Jefferson was hostile to all tyrannies he perceived and it looks like he got the two main ones.</comment>

<comment>Uh, you know those red and white stripes on our flag?East India Company Corporate Flag/Logo.So, why is it taking up over three quarters of our flag?</comment>

I lost my decoder ring so I can't tell you precisely when, but if you stand in the right spot on the right day of the year at high noon the sun's shadow will show you the secret burial chamber of George Washington and the treasure vaults within which is where all the gold in Fort Knox was relocated to.However I'm just clinging to my Bibles and guns, so to me it's just 13 bars and 50 stars of chiseled steel and sex appeal.

<comment>I'm not disputing the composition of the bars on either flag, I'm preemptively mocking any notion that it means anything other than Colonial flag sewers were lazy gits and that a really easy way to make a new flag is to modify an existing one.  Go look at our Grand Union flag, it looks a lot like the British Red Ensign with white bars sewn onto it, doesn't it?  I wonder why that is...  Hint, it probably doesn't mean the American revolution was plotted by British naval officers.</comment>

<comment>Preemptively mockery is sort of like premature ejaculation.Here, have a tissue.</comment>

<comment>Gotta love the modern GOP. Hates America, constantly unhappy, constantly harping on imaginary crises, fostering nativism and bigotry, incapable of governing, relentlessly sour and pessimistic, entirely lacking practical solutions.</comment>

<comment>I was just thinking how nearly all of those apply to the Democrats, which means your comment is blindly partisan.</comment>

<comment>Only if you assume that the conservative world does exist, and in this world AGW doesn't happen, you can force women to perform abortions in back alley, you can force poor to not be poor,  tax cuts pay for themselves, and you can solve all ills in the world with military and tough talk.Yes, than you may reach the conclusion you did....</comment>

<comment>Lets review them one by one then:- Hates America: Wasn't it Michelle Obama who said "for the first time in my adult lifetime, I am really proud of my country.".  So what was she feeling all those years prior to her husband being elected?  Scorn?  Contempt?  Hatred?  You don't mention what your proxy for hatred is, I tend to view it in terms of who is trying hardest to change the most things, because people happy with something aren't looking to remake it wholesale like the Democrats seem to want to do with healthcare, income inequality, minimum wage, affirmative action, gay marriage, gun control, pollution control, finance reform, immigration reform, and a whole host of other issues.- Constantly unhappy: I have some happiness data which I hope you'll accept as a substitute for unhappiness.  "Some 45% of all Republicans report being very happy,compared with just 30% of Democrats and 29% of independents."http://www.pewresearch.org/fil...- constantly harping on imaginary crises:  Do you real The Atlantic or Mother Jones?  They're always whining about some perceived inequality or slightly.  I mentioned a few of the issues above, but they mostly break down to there being or too many or too few women or minorities somewhere in their view.- fostering nativism and bigotry:  Affirmative action breeds contempt and bigotry.  Do you think people who feel displaced by less qualified minorities are going to leave with a good feeling about those groups?  Are the people that encounter them and find them less qualified on average than other groups that didn't need affirmative action going to perceive that as being some inherent flaw in those groups?  Rolling buses full of illegals into a community creates fear and breeds nativism, just look at the resurgence of neo-Nazi parties in Europe due not to any brilliant marketing on their part, but due to the actions of the government pushing refugees into these places and the ensuing riots and problems they cause?-  incapable of governing:  The States seem to run just fine more of them are run entirely by Republicans.  The federal government is dysfunctional, but it's bipartisan.  Remember all the House bills Democrat Reid never allowed to be voted on in the Senate?- relentlessly sour and pessimistic:  Democrats are full of doom and gloom.  From climate change to Policing of minorities it is complaint after complaint.  Just look at Obama's fatalistic narrative about what America will be like without more gun control.- entirely lacking practical solutions:  More government and more regulation is the only solution I've ever seen Democrats offer, and if that worked things should have been improving for decades because the government has never been bigger.So there you go, my case for your comment applying to the Democrats as well, which I think makes you a partisan hack for really believing it only applied to "the other side of the aisle".</comment>

<comment>I love government shutdowns.  It causes progressives to whine because they are scared life will end with out the federal government.</comment>

<comment>And their fingers in all the little pies. Oink!</comment>

<comment>"It causes progressives to whine because they are scared life will end with out the federal government."But, I thought the Right made it clear that the American way of life will end if we don't stop all immigration and monitor the Muslims?</comment>

<comment>It's good for the open boarder policy you favor.</comment>

<comment>"the open boarder policy"Room and boarder?</comment>

<comment>You must support illegal immgrationsince E-Verify and legal prosessing of illegal immigrants and deportations would be halted in a shutdown</comment>

<comment>You give people a democracy and a vote to elect their reps.  You give them protected rights and the ability to come and go as they please, travelling to and through any and all states without inconvenience or troubles.Then they want to live in a prison where no one can be trusted and everyone will have papers AND SUBMIT TO ANY 2-BIT CONSTABLE ANYWHERE WHO WANTS TO SHAKE YOU DOWN.Peterw- we're dealing with some ungrateful spoiled brats.</comment>

<comment>I support illegals.  They clean my house for a cheap price.</comment>

<comment>Law is for others only?Pay your half of Social security and Medicare and withhold her half or you are just a common white color criminal, cheating her out of her social security to avoid your own responsibility.I know you are.  Your ethics are confined to Republican largess.</comment>

<comment>I'm a progressive.  The law does not matter.</comment>

<comment>You are not a very progressive progressive.</comment>

<comment>I am progressive.  I believe int he living Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Yeah! All the people who work in our national security apparatus that will be furlonged during a shutdown and therefore not able to keep our country safe is so funny!</comment>

<comment>I'm OK with that.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure if something happens in that time Congress will take the blame right?</comment>

<comment>You will.</comment>

<comment>OK, then you are in the minority of folks who have been rooting for a shutdown lately, many of whom also prefer an increase in the size of our national security apparatus. You know, the type that wants the military to get even bigger and the NSA/Homeland to have the ability to severely curtail our freedoms to protect us. Glad you aren't one of those...Although it's a bit cold to be happy at the thought of millions of people finding their income significantly curtailed, especially with Christmas right around the corner, but to each his own.</comment>

<comment>Then they can get private sector jobs.</comment>

<comment>In all those millions of open private sector job?Let's be honest, even if cutting taxes and the size of the federal government would spur the creation of millions of new private sector jobs, that process couldn't be done overnight. The shock to the economy of millions of people suddenly scrambling for whatever job was available due to a protractor government shutdown would be easily wipe out any gains made by the government not spending money.</comment>

<comment>Lets be honest. Government is nothing but a welfare program.</comment>

<comment>It can happen for a little while but it's not sustainableA week long furlough's not going to break the bank for most.  But a permanent shutdown would put hundred of thousands of federal employees out of work. Plenty more continue to work during a shutdown without pay.  If it went on too long these people would simply leave.</comment>

<comment>Millions in waste every time.  Will you pay for the next ones?Yep, unless you don't pay any Federal income taxes.</comment>

<comment>I pay more than you in taxes.</comment>

<comment>HEHE.  Buck, let's be honest, what can you do positive for anybody that will pay you to do it?You have no skills, no judgement, and your temperament is downright crass and rude.It must be inheritance that sustains your 1040.</comment>

<comment>Dude..I'm in the top 2% of income.</comment>

<comment>Top 2% eh?39.6 or carried interst@15%</comment>

<comment>No carried interest in my life.  Anyway, you don't understand carried interest.</comment>

<comment>Yeah! Because screw the poor, our veterans, and anyone who works for a government that administers services to 300 million people.</comment>

<comment>He's rich and he hates our government anyway.The bravery and generosity is spellbinding.</comment>

<comment>How are the poor screwed?</comment>

<comment>On the contrary I think Republicans, to the extent any are actually limited government fiscal conservatives, win every time they prevent spending or borrowing from automatically increasing without a discussion.  Further every time the government shuts down and your average American realizes just how "non-essential" the non-essential employees really are it is a win.This is especially true when you consider during the last shutdown they went out of their way to try and make it as painful and visible to end users as possible. My favorite example of that was exempting some Park Service employees from their furloughs in order to bring them in to erect metal barricades to block public access to open air memorials that are un-guided and un-staffed when the government is normally operating.  I also liked individual States that offered to pay to open National Parks because those are actually revenue generators.</comment>

<comment>Let's be clear: I believe the Park Service is under the Dept of the Interior, which is a cabinet post under who? Anybody?  Anybody?</comment>

<comment>George Bush!  It was him!  Oh, wait, this was 2013.</comment>

<comment>Sally Jewell</comment>

<comment>Former Mobil Oil CEO runs the dept.  call her.</comment>

<comment>Good & bad in all kinds</comment>

<comment>Well the parks are non essentialYou want them open but don't want to the people working there?</comment>

<comment>They belong to the American people, NOT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.This is not their government to destroy.It is the government of the PEOPLE.</comment>

<comment>There WERE people working there, who do you think set up the metal barricades and made sure nobody removed them or climbed over them?  My point was it was a political stunt to try and make the shutdown painful to ordinary folks, so Obama paid Park Police to keep the monuments closed instead of keep them open.  It's basically like paying to put an employee in a ticket booth to tell people the park is closed instead of selling them tickets to get in.  </comment>

<comment>Those monuments are the property of the government. If someone got hurt then they may sue all of us.</comment>

<comment>She doesn't care.  She has her own value system and nothing that doesn't directly help her is useless.</comment>

<comment>So you have already forgotten the crazy woman who before the last shutdown smeared green paint defacing the Lincoln memorial?If Republicans could, they'd ruin every single public employee's job and family and call it good.Some folks don't deserve to live in this country at all.</comment>

<comment>Apparently it is you who have forgotten, because the green paint vandalism occurred on July 23, 2013, fully two months BEFORE the shutdown.   Nice try though, and it would have worked too, except I believe the truth will set you free and am not so easily mislead...http://www.cnn.com/2013/07/26/...http://www.cnn.com/2013/09/30/...</comment>

<comment>Then you said "WE DON"T NEED ANY GUARDS ITS OPEN SPACE."The Capitol Police felt differently with that incident fresh in their minds.</comment>

<comment>The Park Police are there. They keep a low profile at most monuments and memorials.But ya, laying off the police is always a good idea.</comment>

<comment>I think you're missing the main point though, which is that  if you can pay the Park Police to deploy the barricades and ensure nobody removes them you could also have paid them to sit and watch the monument as usual without inconveniencing anyone.  Obama chose to try and make the shutdown painful.</comment>

<comment>The POTUS does not do ground maintenance or security.Ted Cruz orders those from the Senate.The vandalism was fresh from an earlier incident with a homeless crazy lady.</comment>

<comment>There were no Park personnel to maintain the memorials and monuments. The Park Police do not clean or maintain the sites.Obama didn't have the choice. Park Police are essential personnel. Park Rangers aren't.</comment>

<comment>Who would clean up and maintains the other side of the barricades where people who aren't admitted congregate?  I don't recall reading about any litter or damage from the Veterans that pushed the gates over and went in anyway.http://talkingpointsmemo.com/l...</comment>

<comment>So if what you say is true you should object to the existence of parks anyway.  Not the government's job</comment>

<comment>ARTICLE IV, SECTION 3, CLAUSE 2 of the Constitution states, "The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States".  I'd argue historical and ecological preservation is a valid need under that power.</comment>

<comment>not necessaryallowed sure but no more necessary than roads or anything.</comment>

<comment>Waaaaa I want free things but don't want to pay for them!Obama's a big meanie!</comment>

<comment>On the contrary I don't want most of what the government creates even if it were free.  I'll happily for Constitutionally enumerated Federal government services like roads, courts, currency, and a small military to protect our borders.  These things are relatively inexpensive.  Now if you take all the other stuff and think the US government should be in the business of providing insurance and health care, then you can't.</comment>

<comment>You arrogant ass!The government is not running for YOU.It is running for the PEOPLE.</comment>

<comment>Republican definition of "limited government" invade and re-build as many countries as possible but cut Medicare and Social Security and repeal healthcare for your own people.Americans are fed up with Republicans ideas of "government."Vote them out.</comment>

<comment>So how conservatives are going to monitor terrorists when the government is shut down?  Or, as they always do, they want to fund only those activities they like?</comment>

<comment>Conservatism is based on deception.  Their candidates run on fixing the government (wink wink) and when elected, do nothing else but further rigging the elections and channeling the money to rich.  Then they come back to their base and lie that all the mess they created is the fault of liberals and liberal government.</comment>

<comment>Last night Lester Holt evening news ended with the story of a young Muslim man who volunteered after 911 and was subsequently killed in the battle of Falluja.Lester walked up to his grave, adorned with flowers, and said "This Muslim is already home."  No one can deport him, screen him out or deny his contribution.</comment>

<comment>Bless him. My half-sister's father lies there too. Republicans need to remember that all federal employees aren't IRS agents processing their money.</comment>

<comment>Judging from the general incompetence, pettiness, and short-sightedness of congress right now. I honestly wouldn't be all that surprised if they sleepwalked into a government shutdown. Then will come the inevitable "This is Obama's fault. If he had just capitulated to my every whim, I wouldn't have shut down the government. America. Freedom. The media is biased..."</comment>
