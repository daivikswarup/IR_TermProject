<comment>Bernie is by far the best person running in terms of character.  Nice guy, honest, kind....he is just not very bright.  His ideas about government are not ever to be taken seriously.  Hillary Clinton is so fundamentaly flawed as both a person and a candidate that she has been disqualified from ever holding high office again.</comment>

<comment>Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland are among the most prosperous, healthy and happy democracies in the world. All are democratic socialist countries. You either know nothing about what Bernie Sanders stands for or you're a lying shill for Wall St.</comment>

<comment>And none of those 4 tiny, relatively homogenous Scandinavian nations have much of anything in common with America. Geez, 320,000,000 Americans versus an entire country the size of what Atlanta or Denver AND filled with secular educated law abiding white people. If only that was what the U.S. looked like, we'd be rolling in heaven's softest featherbed.</comment>

<comment>So? America is will be biggest and best. This idea that we can't provide a minimum of services to our citizens because we're too big (and too rich) is just silly.</comment>

<comment>the issue is the citizens who require this "minimum of services" you speak of provide zero in return. they have little to no human capital and such is life in a free market society.</comment>

<comment>So you want to send the poor over a border along with all illegals..  or is it to concentration camps . ."minimum of services" in most civilised countries means some sort of health care for the poor, public transport and cops that don't shoot you if you are the wrong color..</comment>

<comment>is that what i said? no, it's not. go elsewhere if you wish to debate in absolutes. only infantile progressive sycophants believe the world to be black and white. it's not. it's highly complex and deserves at least an attempt at critical thought. and race baiting is soooo 2015. know your trends if you're going to succumb to them so easily.</comment>

<comment>Your opinion gets more-than slightly discredited when your whole account portrays a significant bias towards HRC.</comment>

<comment>Data don't lie.This is the third time Bernie as been "closing" the gap... only to have the polls show a different story.As of Jan. 15th. Hillary is beating Bernie 66% to 29% in Reuters Tracking Poll... The media light to highlight the tight polls rather than the one's like today's Wall Street Journal's Poll, which also shows Bernie getting clobbered.The media likes to say that Bernie is the new Barack. The problem with this is that Bernie is an old, white male, who will never gain Obama's minority support. Nor will Bernie ever gain his colleagues support, unlike Obama was able to do.His colleagues know Bernie's not qualified to be President. Warren will not endorse him.

<comment>^Flag the fraud.^^^</comment>

<comment>While national polls do reflect Hillary's dominance, there is a very different picture painted when you look state by state. That's what Sanders supporters are focusing on, since national polls don't mean anything until there's a national election.In New Hampshire:http://www.realclearpolitics.c...Sanders is currently winning by 5 points.In Iowa:http://www.realclearpolitics.c...Sanders trails HRC by 4 points, inside the margin of error.As you can see, a lot can and will change as we continue to move towards the nomination, and you certainly cannot argue that there is a guarantee of anything. You're right, data don't lie.</comment>

<comment>Sorry... It's not gonna happen. In South Carolina Hillary is up 40% points. And Obama's close friend, Eric Holder, was in the state today tell African Americans to support Hillary. The minority vote is going to doom Bernie. Obama is supporting her through his confidants and reaching out to the minority community and they will never turn on Obama, especially for an older, white, Jewish man.Here's what is happening. The media like to play up 1) how close the primary is (when it's not) and 2) how harshly the Clinton campaign is attacking Bernie (when it's not). By playing up both of these issues Bernie supporters believe there is hope and they fork over more money... which ends up in the media's pocket. I am also making money off this scheme. I like Bernie. Always have. But, don't be fooled by what is going on.</comment>

<comment>You think it's not certainly not going to happen, but you don't back it up with evidence.This is a graph of the Iowa polls.http://elections.huffingtonpos...On May 4, there was a 43 point difference between Sanders and Clinton.In less than 8 months in Iowa, Sanders has risen 37 points and Clinton decreased by 11. There's no other adjective to describe his rise other than meteoric. Nobody expected this.Now, I'm definitely not insinuating his nomination is anything but a long shot, but IF he wins Iowa, IF he wins New Hampshire, and IF he's consistent with his growth, there is absolutely a chance he can be a contender.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, and if you unsmooth the data, which should not have been smoothed... it isn't as dramatic as you think. I know data, I know history, I know my facts. Bernie won't be the nominee.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure what you mean, but it doesn't seem as it matters since you've cemented your perspective long ago. Let's agree to disagree.</comment>

<comment>How are you making money?</comment>

<comment>SO should we discount your view because you like Trump?</comment>

<comment>^Flag the fraud.^^^^^</comment>

<comment>Yep. The Sanders campaign did a media push to make the race appear tight and the media is more than happy to oblige. They really want an exciting horse race. But, its not nearly as close as the hype is making it sound. Hillary still has a stable 25 pt lead nationally.</comment>

<comment>. . . . and in the middle of January in 2008 Hillary was also ahead of the second place guy by double digits. Don't forget history.</comment>

<comment>Bernie will do relatively well in states that are more than 85% white and have abnormally low poverty rates. Hillary will do better everywhere else.http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-th...https://www.washingtonpost.com...The people who support Sen. Sanders are much like those who elected President Ralph Nader in 2000, President John Anderson in 1980, and President George McGovern in 1972.</comment>

<comment>The more things change, the more they remain the same.  In this case, I can definitely see, for Clinton, a reprise of 2008.Someday, probably not all that far in the future, the US will elect a woman as President.  Nobody thinks that's impossible any more.  But her name won't be Hilary Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Either 4 or 8 years in the future, depending on Bernie's health.</comment>

<comment>It has actually been a bad idea to shield Hillary Clinton so much from public view.  She needs to work on her public negatives, such as indifference and hostility, rather than simply avoiding them.</comment>

<comment>She comes across as uncaring and insincere to me. Whether we agree or not, whether we think it is right or not, how a candidate comes across through the mass media is the most important thing in an election. We would have had very different candidates starting with JFK is this was not true.</comment>

<comment>The first couple of primary states might be close but otherwise this article describes 'alternate reality' -- at least per this recent poll: http://time.com/4183753/hillar.....Somehow actually nominate Sanders? Dems lose around 45-49 states in the national election.</comment>

<comment>I don't see Sanders as getting the nomination. He is in essence this era's Howard Dean.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, but I think the general phenomenon of a charismatic outsider about whom only a limited amount is known to the general public is similar.In honesty, I have liked listening to/watching Sanders. He gives a very strong impression of real personal integrity.Then I begin to think about what he *says* and I still like him, and wish him nothing but the best in his next re-election bid in Vermont.</comment>

<comment>Dean was really quite clever. The only time in the last decade+ that the DNC's been effective is when he was running it, and look how badly it all fell apart after he left.</comment>

<comment>Clinton keeps falling.  If Sanders wins the first few states, Clinton is in trouble.</comment>

<comment>And if Sanders loses Iowa and New Hampshire - statistically as likely as Clinton losing both based on even the best polls for Sanders - then Sanders' goose is cooked. He is doing really, really badly in the South and west, among Hispanics and Black voters.Fatalistic assumptions work both ways. Sanders is still a massive underdog who's yet to take a beating in the press. He's coasted this far. No one coasts to the White House.</comment>

<comment>In a way, it looks like Trump vs Clinton, in spite of the putative slide.</comment>

<comment>I look forward to them debating.  Trump isn't much at substance but he is very good at roasting the media and politicians.</comment>

<comment>Not only did the DNC schedule this debate on a holiday weekend it's going to overlap an NFL playoff game.  They are doing everything in their power to crown Clinton as the nominee. If Sanders doesn't win the nomination I will either not vote in the general election or I will vote for Trump.  I will absolutely not support Clinton after the way the DNC has treated Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Socialism by definition embraces consumer choice.  Communism does not, therefore the two are not compatible.</comment>

<comment>You're wrong.  Once more, communism is a type of socialism It emphasizes class warfare and tends to be willing to use violence to achieve its goals.  How much "consumer choice" here is is irrelevant.</comment>

<comment>There are no classes under communism and if you can't understand the difference in economic structures you can't understand the political structures, either.  Any desceiption offered would therefore be entirely prejudicial.</comment>

<comment>The notion that there are no classes under communism is pure myth, as in there are theoretically no classes in a communism that never actually existed. I assumed you would understand that the communist's emphases on class occurs when they are attempting to over throw a government and impose communism.  Once hey have imposed it, the upper class does everything possible to preserve the new class structure.  Your level of stupidity or dishonesty made that assumption on my part faulty.  The Soviet Union, communist China, and North Korea were/are all socialist BECAUSE they were communist.  The "consumer choice" their citizens enjoyed/enjoy is between expensive, poorly sized, low quality, plain brown shoes and expensive, poorly sized, low quality, plain black shoes.  Or is something so obviously factually true and conceptually simple beyond your understanding?</comment>

<comment>North Korea and the Soviet Union are and were aristocracies.  By definition socialist and communist systems have no enforced social hierarchy, no privileged elite.  Both countries conquered by conservative counter-revolutions, in the case of the Soviet Union a near carbon-copy of the old Tsarist system.</comment>

<comment>I agree!</comment>

<comment>Fair enough, considering the DNC did everything in its power to steal the 2008 election from her and gift it to Obama.</comment>

The corporate dems will do everything they can to prevent Sanders from happening. All stops will be pulled any day now.</comment>

<comment>First off, just because its in the Bill of Rights doesn't mean that limits can't be placed on gun ownership. There's plenty of limits on free speech. Second, the Amendments are INTERPRETED.

The ensuing flood of guns into public hands has created a severe public health crises across the nation. That's more than enough reason to pass regulations and reinterpret the Second Amendment.</comment>

<comment>You'd think that vote to give gun manufacturers immunity would have gained him some favor with the NRA.</comment>

<comment>That's why I said he probably ain't AS bad as Hillary. He only has a D- from the NRA, though, but that's still WAY better than most democrats.</comment>

<comment>Sanders can offer free money - but the Republican Congress has to approve it.OTOH, Obama seems to have no problem getting the Republicans to fund all his dubious stuff - such as Syrian refugees.</comment>

<comment>He only has to promise it in the election for voters to support him. And Republicans in Congress would probably be MORE than welcome to approve it if they find it can get them some votes and their Congressional Salaries.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is a vile Cow. She is unfit for any office above that of Washroom Matron.</comment>

<comment>She changes the bibs on Bills floozies after he spooges on them.</comment>

<comment>Yes, because washroom matrons are terrible people who deserve your scorn. They are good decent people making crap, but working hard. You would throw Hillary into their already difficult and thankless job? That's just cruel. They deserve better. </comment>

<comment>Today's results of an NBC News- WSJ poll indicate, if Trump is the GOP's candidate, voters will vote for Hillary 51% over Trump 41%. Sounds like the GOP better pick a better candidate than Trump if they want a candidate who will lead their party to victory.</comment>

<comment>LOL. The same NBC that hired Chelsea Clinton to an intern job, but paid her a 600K salary.Most polls have Hillary ahead by two points.</comment>

<comment>Denying the facts might help you get through the day, but they're still facts. Trump is a Hillary Clinton landslide. The GOP's future is at stake here.</comment>

<comment>It will be Cruz. Trump never really had a chance with conservatives, not like an actual conservative. That's what all that New York values talk is. It may mean nothing to you, but religious white people from the interior share that same view. Cruz gave up very little by making that remark. He wasn't going to win New York even if he was the nominee so why not throw that card down now and shore up the nomination, you know what I mean? Regardless, Trump is done. He peaked a month ago. </comment>

<comment>Go ahead. Deny reality right up to the end when we -- ONCE AGAIN-- kick you azzes.</comment>

<comment>This time in 2008, McCain was the clear winner.</comment>

<comment>Apparently folks who know Clinton well, say that underneath that 'calculating' public persona, she's actually very warm, idealistic and passionate in her beliefs. But perhaps after all these years of facing relentless attacks and scrutiny, unfortunately she seems to be beaten into an "uber-cautious" mode, where none of that comes across to the public. She really needs to get out from under all that 'armor' and take a little more 'risk'…. and who knows, she might finally find her 'voice' (which BTW, can't be any worse than the Trumpster)!</comment>

<comment>I like Sanders just because I think Clinton is too jaded and I question her decision making ability such as her vote for the Iraq War. I am disappointed that not more prominent Democrats are in the race other than Clinton. I would have liked to see Dianne Feinstein, Jerry Brown, John Lewis, and Elizabeth Warren in the race for example. Both likely will beat whoever the Republicans put forward, but not by much. Trump and Cruz may do well with the far right, but the general election will be different.</comment>

<comment>You know, Hillary has been able to prepare to run since she left State. She already had her money locked down years ago. The rest of those people you mentioned are either uninterested, or busy actually doing things. It takes a guy like Sanders, whose been around so long, to have any chance because he has connections and networks. Martin O'Malley is a great guy but Clinton was miles ahead of him in preparation. This is the least competitive primary I've ever seen for the Dems and that is never good. And they chose to not go negative? Why? Now all the negative attacks will come in the primaries, and each attack will be like dipping your head in cold water. Best to get through that in the primaries.I have very little faith in the Democrats this time around. The only thing you guys got going for you is that we are running Ted, so it should be competitive than it would otherwise be. </comment>

<comment>Time will tell. She may be the darling of the liberals but she is HATED by much of the country. </comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>Well there are a lot more moderates than true liberals. I'd vote for her if she lets me touch Chelsea boob. That's a promise. </comment>

<comment>Feinstein? You might as well vote for Netanyahu.</comment>

<comment>There's a reason that the GOP is hoping, praying and even campaigning for Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Bernie seems like a nice sincere guy, but his "socialist" label will be death in November.  There's really no one else?  If Hillary is indicted, then what?  The Phillies have a better bench than the Democrats.</comment>

<comment>I like Bernie's single payer (Medicare for all) plan, but not how he's planning on paying for it.</comment>

<comment>It's pie in the sky, red meat for the base. What Obama did he could do because they controlled everything. Even then, they had a difficult road. </comment>

<comment>People are already paying for it through sky high deductibles and oop payments. At first I liked the law but now I would like to see it voted out. Single payer yes.</comment>

<comment>As a Democrat woman I support Bill Clinton and muslims immigrants raping us because I just cant get enough of that brown dick.Democrat men are effeminate and limp.  I need a good rape because Democrat men just arent up to it.</comment>

<comment>RedShirt?</comment>

<comment>Tired of looking at her since Arkansas.</comment>

<comment>If the DNC was really serious about maximizing their debate's exposure, they'd hold them at noon on the weekdays, when most of their voters were just "coming to" and rolling out of bed..</comment>

<comment>is anyone else watching Andrea MItchell shake her pom-poms for Hillary on NBC?vomit inducing</comment>

<comment>does Martin O'Malley even know he's still running for President?</comment>

<comment>Well, if he does, I don't think most of America does...</comment>

<comment>he's the third wheel that doesn't know he's the third wheel</comment>

<comment>at least it appears this one will start on time since Hillary isn't too occupied dropping a deuce</comment>

<comment>I wonder why the Congressional Black Caucus didn't host a GOP debate?</comment>

<comment>It would be fascinating if they did....</comment>

<comment>something something Ben Carson</comment>

<comment>Winifred Young's comments are better than yours.</comment>

<comment>pandering to the black population. Hillary doesn't get it. you're not Bill, they won't come out to vote for you</comment>

<comment>Sure they will. If nothing else, the GOP's flirting with white supremacist movements will drive them to the polls in record numbers.</comment>

<comment>doubtful. guess we'll have to wait until November to see what happens</comment>

<comment>Flirting with White supremaciist movements? Are you kidding?What amazes me is that all the diversity is on the GOP side - Hispanics, Indians, African-Americans - even Jeb Bush has a Mexican wife and is a Catholic convert.The Democrats offer up one angry old White guy and a 1970's style White Feminist.</comment>

<comment>Trump has a disturbingly large white supremacist following.</comment>

<comment>source?</comment>

<comment>His speeches draw the white power crowd out. That "seig heil" at his speech a few weeks ago wasn't an anomaly. Stormfront admitted that he's driving so much traffic to their site that they had to upgrade their servers.</comment>

<comment>that's not a source</comment>

<comment>White power groups have endorsed Trump. David Duke gave his endorsement.</comment>

<comment>and the Nation of Islam supported Barack Obama. you act as if these candidates sought out support from known hate groups</comment>

<comment>No Trump supporter I, but his principal appeal is simply that he talks in a non-political way. There's no special racial appeal, and certainly not supremacist.Some desperate Democratic propaganda there. I know more than a few life long Democrats who are planning to vite Republican because they see Obama as completely out of touch with the looming security issues posed by ISIS. He has only himself to blame.</comment>

<comment>and they consider the guy who wants to ban Muslim travel to the US "in touch"? These people are morons.</comment>

<comment>I think very few people want to Muslim travel, but he is at least discussing the issue. Obama seems determined to convince us all it doesn't exist. If we can only impose gun control on the NRA, the problem of Islamic terrorism won't exist. (Huh???)And I write that as one who favors gun control. But, please, talk to the public realistically about issues that concern it.</comment>

<comment>you forgot the rich white guy from Maryland but, to be fair, most of America has forgotten about him</comment>

<comment>Well, you have to have one.</comment>

<comment>I wouldn't count on that.</comment>

<comment>Bernie hates Wall Street. We get it.</comment>

<comment>Nice shout out from Hillary to her United Methodist youth minister. Youth ministry rocks :-)</comment>

<comment>meh. religious pandering. everything that soulless psycho does is cold and calculated</comment>

<comment>I am not a big fan of hers, but her support of her church has been pretty consistent over her lifetime.</comment>

<comment>Who's the third guy on the stage?</comment>

<comment>Slippy.. Slappy.. Sammy.. Swammy...?...SAMSONITE!it was right there on the briefcase!</comment>

<comment>Smart people don't watch football (or NASCAR)</comment>

<comment>except all of those billionaires and millionaires that do and profit handsomely off doing so.NASCAR is f**king dumb though. no denying that</comment>

<comment>they don't watch it – they just own it.</comment>

<comment>they do something in those luxury boxes.f**k exotic animals while doing belly shots off of their slaves perhaps?</comment>

<comment>You never been in one? – no one is watching the game.</comment>

<comment>i have. it was a joke.</comment>

<comment>Love Bernie's agenda. Don't have a clue how he'd actually pass any of it.</comment>

<comment>I know; I have the same issue. I don't disagree, I just don't see how any of that would really happen in the first 100 days.</comment>

<comment>On the other hand, while I like what Hillary said about "doing it together", I don't think the GOP would stand for it and I don't know how she'd do it, either.</comment>

<comment>as much as I hate that witch, she'll be better at reaching across the aisle than Barack. she's a career politician</comment>

<comment>The Republicans despise her. They'll fight her just like they have Obama. I'm surprised a hardcore realist like you doesn't see that.</comment>

<comment>it's as if he's still "rappin" at Woodstock with the muddy blanket crowd</comment>

<comment>He wouldn't but the lefty  low info voters and you extremist don't care.</comment>

<comment>Sanders got the gun question right off the bat!</comment>

<comment>big surprise</comment>

<comment>this "gun debate" is just as idiotic as the "gay marriage" debate from four years ago. focus on picking apart Sanders lack of knowledge when it comes to anything economic</comment>

<comment>Voted against the Brady bill 5 times?!</comment>

<comment>this "gun debate" is no different than the "gay marriage" debate. it's a giant dog and pony show to distract Americans from the economic issues we face and our failed foreign policy abroad</comment>

<comment>exactly.</comment>

<comment>Martin O'Malley should go easy on the Red Bull before these types of events.</comment>

<comment>no shit. that stammer isn't doing him any favors</comment>

<comment>You should go easy on the Jim Beam before you comment on here.</comment>

<comment>Nobody needs an AR-15 to hunt deer.</comment>

<comment>They are for wild hogs, dummy.</comment>

<comment>why?</comment>

<comment>That's not what its designed for.</comment>

<comment>says who?</comment>

<comment>If a 220-lb Michigan antlered buck in rut is charging you, an AR-15 could be very useful.</comment>

<comment>An AR is FAR more likely to be used to shoot at a crowd of people.</comment>

<comment>tell that to those kids in Arkansas that pulled the fire alarm and then sat in the woods with hunting rifles shooting their peers and teachers in the 90's.</comment>

<comment>You are just making this stuff as you go . you are convincing or fooling no one.</comment>

<comment>All I need is one arrow.</comment>

<comment>the 5.56 round (military cartridge which you cannot buy) is based off of the .223 Remington (civilian cartridge) which, *drum roll please!* is most commonly used in hunting rifles.</comment>

<comment>So, high capacity magazines that can be emptied quickly is necessary for hunting?</comment>

<comment>For hunting things that can kill you, yes.</comment>

<comment>and you've never been hunting so we'll just stop there because you are simply speculating as you have zero experience.</comment>

<comment>You need a 30-60 rnd mag to hunt deer?! Yikes!</comment>

<comment>no you don't but if you had ever bothered to serve your country like myself and a couple of others here have then you would quickly realize that with proper training, magazine capacity becomes an arbitrary number when I can speed reload a mag as fast as you can blink. ask California how 10 round magazines worked out for those folks in San Bernardino. if you're advocating for all civilian weapons to be bolt-action then we might be able to agree on something but as it stands, you're just making yourself look foolish with rampant speculation</comment>

<comment>Lives were saved when Adam Lanza needed to reload. Reducing clip capacity at least gives people a chance during a mass shooting event. Its a small advantage, but small steps are the only way to get changes past a militant gun lobby.</comment>

<comment>again, Adam Lanza was not a United States Marine. you miss every point laid out for you because you think you know everything.</comment>

<comment>The 2A isn't about hunting deer. It's about killing those who seek to subjugate.</comment>

<comment>Hillary is looking more low energy than usual.</comment>

<comment>she didn't drop that pre-debate power dump</comment>

<comment>The size of Rand Paul...</comment>

<comment>Yeah – she's the one who should have had the Red Bull, not O'Malley.</comment>

<comment>Wow, Bernie is on fire.</comment>

<comment>Do the other two candidates get to speak?</comment>

<comment>Hillary will adopt your orphaned babies!</comment>

<comment>Hillary with the rational, practical agenda.</comment>

<comment>What would you know about either based on your comment history?</comment>

<comment>He/she is paid by the Hillary campaign.</comment>

<comment>has to be. haven't seen dick-riding like that since Naidm/Bradan was all about the refugees going to Germany</comment>

<comment>if by rational and practical you mean stand for nothing and allow your stances to sway with the popular opinion of the loudest mob and exude zero leadership ability then yes, she is very rational and practical</comment>

<comment>Its funny how many times you hear "my opponent is absolutely correct".</comment>

<comment>yeah! bankrupt Medicaid and force Republican governors to play the bad cop role when they refuse to waste state tax payer money funding a Federal program! yeah!</comment>

<comment>Hillary scores on health care! Bernie's plan is impossible to get past congress.</comment>

<comment>Bored swings and misses and strikes out again.</comment>

<comment>if you look closely you can see just a bit of the reptilian scales around Hillary's collar. someone needs to touch up her make-up during the next commercial break. wouldn't want the lizard queen exposed</comment>

<comment>is O'Malley trying to grow a mustache?</comment>

<comment>That third guy is taking again.</comment>

<comment>Bernies Healthcare Payment Plan1.) take everyones money2.) take all the profits from big business3.) mehhhh....</comment>

<comment>Fix and defend Obamacare. Don't rip it up and try to start again. Nobody wants another health care war in congress.</comment>

<comment>Clinton is such a smug twat</comment>

<comment>Issues with outspoken women?</comment>

<comment>nope. just smug twats. nice play though. right out of your Lil SJW Manual</comment>

<comment>Poor Hill theyre spending MILLIONS!!! attacking her.</comment>

<comment>What costs are down in healthcare, exactly?</comment>

<comment>none</comment>

<comment>Tom Delay! More like Tom DeGAY! amirite?!-Hillary</comment>

<comment>Hillary has the experience to get things done by reaching across the aisle. How many Republican would work with a self described "socialist"?</comment>

<comment>The same quantity that would work with a self-described democrat.Probably more than would work hand in hand with Jesus, because they love the man, but hate what he stood for. </comment>

<comment>Exactly when has Hillary "reached across the aisle?"  When she was senator she only wrote and proposed three bills, happy things like naming highways after people.  Now that's leadership!  Sure, she'd been in the Senate for 8 years, but she hardly is known for "reaching across the aisle."Bernie on the other hand was an independent mayor of Burlington for three terms, who as an independent reached across two aisles!  He was a congressman for 18 years prior to becoming a senator in 2006.  He's been reaching across aisles longer than we've known Hillary's name.Vote for Hillary, but please let's drop the Clinton mythology.  They are not icons of leadership. They've never taken a difficult or principled stand on anything in their political lives.</comment>

<comment>Poor Bernie is going to hypervenilate if he doesn't calm down</comment>

<comment>Someone give Bernie a Ricola.</comment>

<comment>Wishing someone would give you a fast acting sleeping pill.</comment>

<comment>You sound crabby tonight, limoman. Are you upset that the nation's next president is standing on that stage?</comment>

<comment>Nah you are just an annoying person with your mindless partisan drivel.</comment>

<comment>What a douche.</comment>

<comment>Bernie doesn't take money from the big banks....yet. If he's the nominee, he sure as hell will need to.</comment>

<comment>After buying the Clintons,  the big banks might be short on cash.Hillary's no cheap escort,  she's a $600,000 escort.Imagine what Bill got for killing Glass-Seagall!</comment>

<comment>Clinton 2016 is taking on water fast and sinking by the bow.</comment>

<comment>This ship can't sink. Ignore your lying eyes.</comment>

<comment>She is a Cunning Runt and she's not a Numb Digger, so she will be tough to stop.</comment>

<comment>Can Hilary stop her slide? Yeah all she needs to do is slam on the breaks! Oh 😖 wait that's right she hasn't drivin a car in 25 years!!!😂</comment>
