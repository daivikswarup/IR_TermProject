<comment>As a point of principle, CWA is correct to prefer Sanders to Clinton.  But for practical purposes I have a lot of doubts Sanders can overcome the huge institutional advantages Clinton has.  What will be most interesting is just how much money CWA pours into the primary for Sanders versus what it holds in reserve for the general.  That will say a lot more about how viable they think Sanders is in the primary versus this being a shot across the bow to Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Even if Sanders loses to Clinton, he has steered the election debate (at least on the Democratic side) toward socio-economic issues. In a time of corporate hegemony, that's a significant victory.</comment>

<comment>I agree with that, and I applaud him for doing it.</comment>

<comment>The Feds are still investigating Hillary.</comment>

<comment>Even if Sanders doesn't win, he's been inspiring a lot of people that are traditionally apathetic to the political process to get genuinely involved. No matter how you cut it, thats a good thing. If Sanders loses the nomination, I really hope his message carries through now and future elections (mid-terms too guys!)</comment>

<comment>"He has joined picket lines and styled himself as a defender of the middle class."It's not some affectation he's started as a way to be elected president. He has a long history of actively working, fighting, and voting for the middles class. He's not styling himself as anything but himself. More so, he's about the only candidate left, right or center that you could honestly say that about.</comment>

<comment>Here Here!</comment>

<comment>Will Clinton make it ? Can she overcome ?    ......breaking news !  No she can't !</comment>

<comment>Oh , you haven't heard ?  Lol, shut the fack up dude !</comment>

<comment>Clinton, our Panderer in Chief.</comment>

<comment>She is actually unelectable facing the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Facing certain GOP candidates, yes. They know who they need to nominate to beat her.</comment>

<comment>The Feds are still investigating her.</comment>

<comment>This will become painfully obvious when she has to loan her own campaign her own family's personal money to keep it afloat.</comment>

<comment>??  When did I post this ?  Can I see into the future or what !</comment>

<comment>At least 2 months into the future.LOL!</comment>

<comment>Good for him.He's still not becoming POTUS. He's not going to get the nomination. And unless Hillary's campaign completely collapses-and even then, this is a maybe-this will not change in 2016.</comment>

<comment>DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN!!!</comment>

<comment>We shall see.......we shall see</comment>

<comment>Hillary Clinton is actually unelectable when faced with the GOP.</comment>

<comment>Every single GOP clown candidate is actually unelectable when faced with a monkey in a top hat throwing it's own poop.</comment>

<comment>Remember this?http://www.gallup.com/poll/103...</comment>

<comment>I don't know that this will matter much in the long run. Still, Bernie's a good man, so good for him.</comment>

<comment>It's a good indication of where the primaries are going. Unlike Clinton's endorsements that are in name only, this was a democratic poll of tens-of-thousands that lasted months. It was unanimous for Bernie Sanders.</comment>

<comment>That's very interesting; and could bode very well for Sanders.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is basically a joke candidate with no chance of winning.</comment>

<comment>No that is the Republican party.</comment>

<comment>You think Sanders is beating Clinton?</comment>

<comment>At this point that's still very possible. Not necessarily probable, but it actually could happen.Even the worst team in baseball wins a few dozen games every season because *spoiler/gasp* they actually play the games instead of just giving a W to the favorite (although I'm sure that idea probably sounds great to you).Sanders isn't a joke candidate, and he has a non-zero chance of winning because...wait for it...your singular dumb opinion isn't actually how elections are decided. That's what voting is for.</comment>

<comment>He won't win.</comment>

<comment>What a well-thought out, reasoned, and might I add courageous reply. Bravo.</comment>

<comment>You left out correct. Not one serious person thinks he will win.</comment>

<comment>Thankfully the vote is not restricted to so-called serious people.</comment>

<comment>“Bernie Sanders just won the first election that’s happenedin this country, for President.” – CWA President Chris Shelton</comment>

<comment>Bernie's been on picket lines forever; not just since the beginning of the campaign.  I watched a video of him on labor day in Iowa.  He jumps out of a car walks over to the picket line, picks up a sign and begins walking with everyone else.  No need for a focus group or campaign manager to tell him how to act.  And yet, some unions like SEIU backed Clinton who spends as much of her time courting fat cats as she does campaigning with the people.  Go figure.</comment>

<comment>I do wonder how so many on this thread can be so sure Clinton will get the nomination.  I haven't had the ability to predict the future with such conviction since high school.  :(</comment>

<comment>Please get this guy elected. Stop saying if he does not win and let's just make sure he wins. Let's say we are not ok with a 2nd choice! wE want Bernie! </comment>

<comment>I still think Ben and Jerry (the actual guys) are his most significant supporters. Unions and PACs are both great endorsements that will ensure a lot of money and campaign work, but a lot of people have a knee jerk hatred of both, even on the left. Ice cream, though, who could be opposed to that? Supposedly they're even coming out with a special flavor for Bernie Sanders, Ben Cohen was on Reddit the other day hinting that it might be called Bernie Pecan, if I remember correctly.</comment>

<comment>Are these Sander's supporters delusional?? Probably New England and a couple of other states but he has a snowball's chance in hell of getting a single vote in the South. Hillary will have him for breakfast.However in the general election she is only a bit less divisive than Trump.</comment>

<comment>What a piece of damp-palmed concern trolling.Let us be clear.  An organized working class is not a "special interest."If union bureaucrats organize themselves for their personal enrichment, like the party bureaucrats under Stalin during the Thermidorean Reaction against the Russian Revolution, then they are a Special Interest.That is not what is happening here.Good for organized labor for organizing Super PACs against the Fossil Bourgeois Billionaires.Good for the most progressive elements of organized labor for pushing the party of bourgeois democracy (as distinct from bourgeous authoritarianism) to the left, from its existing position of center-right neoliberalism.I personally believe Sanders would beat any of the clowns that the Bourgeois Authoritarians looks likely to put forward, and this would be a valuable stem in the dialectic trajectory.  More likely it will be Clinton who wins nomination and election.  The stronger Sanders'  labor support, the less mediocre will be a Clinton Presidency that follows.  And the stronger will be subsequent conscious political activity by an invigorated and self-aware working class.</comment>

<comment>yep.  But even more fundamentally, ALL INTERESTS ARE "SPECIAL".  Calling something a "special interest" is really meaningless, and mainly a form of ad hominem attack to discredit an idea without addressing its merits.Folks advocate for what they believe.  There is nothing wrong with that IMO.  What I do have a problem is when certain folks are able to advocate in ways that corrupt the system, and that typically is when things are non-transparent, or so far out of proportion to the number of votes/citizens that support the issue, that policy doesn't follow the will of the citizens.  1 person anonymously giving $1mil is far different than 100,000 people transparently giving $10 each, even though the total cash is the same.  If a SuperPAC wants to support Bernie, all he needs to do is to ask them to release their donor list and pretty much all the issues are solved IMO.  Sunlight is a great disinfectant.It still seems quite unlikely that Bernie can win the nomination.  But his campaign has changed the debate, and that is as important as anything.  I'm still undecided (as I think Bernie fear-mongers about trade and some other issues, focusing only on the downsides despite the data about upsides for consumers, geopolitics, US economic competitiveness, etc.), but his presence has been beneficial regardless of where I eventually vote.The biggest problem is potentially if the left-wing fundamentalists decide to pout and stay home if/when Bernie loses.  Fundamentalism is stupid whether it comes from the right or the left.  Democracy is about compromise and consensus building, and that means supporting things you disagree with often so that you can get more of the things that you DO agree with.  Gore/Nader showed us what happens when the far left throws a temper tantrum.</comment>

<comment>In the end the only thing that really counts is who votes and who they vote for. Backing from Dems in congress and unions is all secondary.</comment>

<comment>FYI, the nurses' PAC is not a "Super PAC", it is just a PAC like the Congressional Black Caucus PAC.   Contrary to the CBC PAC which endorsed Clinton without a vote of the CBC membership, the nurses' PAC represents the vote of the membership of the nurses union, so that is the difference between the unions and their PACs that support Clinton without the vote of their members and the unions that support Sanders with the vote of their members.</comment>

<comment>Senator Bernie Sanders has all the qualities of a true leader! Bernie is fair, kind, honest, humble, energetic, authentic, intelligent, experienced, and passionate about helping all children succeed, thus building a stronger and brighter USA for future generations! Check out Bernie's long record fighting for Americans on you tube. There is a big difference in democratic (by the people) socialist (for the people). In one way or the other, every single person born in this country has benefited from this country's social programs. Public schools, post office, our roads, utilities, national parks (which saved the buffalo) social security, etc etc. are examples of democratic socialist programs. 170 of the world's top economists say Bernie's plan will save the middle class and help more people reach the middle class by creating a fair min wage which is long over due. The average family will save approx 5,000 a year on health costs. Vote smart! Vote Bernie!</comment>
