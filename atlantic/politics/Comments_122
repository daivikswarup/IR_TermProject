<comment>"In other words: It’s all about tribal identification, not policy."It's very difficult to stay on top of everything that's happening in politics.  I try to commit time to it and participate in the debate, but I also have to work, eat and generally get things done!While I can understand, and be swayed by some of the economic and philosophical underpinnings of the Republican party, I simply cannot condone the xenophobia, ethno-centricism and bigotry that is tolerated by that party.  For that reason, I must side with the Democrats, by default.</comment>

<comment>You could go your own way, you know.</comment>

<comment>I do, but on matters on which I am not fully versed, my tendency for the above stated reasons would be to naturally assume the Democrats' position.  Not due to tribalism, but because, in my opinion, they are the party with greater legitimacy.</comment>

<comment>My point is that in my opinion, neither is legitimate enough to support.</comment>

<comment>then we differ...</comment>

<comment>Indeed.</comment>

<comment>I mean, do you think that voting for a third party really helps the political process?</comment>

<comment>I have real strange, idiosyncratric views on all this and won't bore you with them unless you indicate you want to be bored. I'd characterize them as orthogonal, rather than diametrically opposed.</comment>

<comment>I'm actually interested and curious. A libertarian once told me that third-parties get funding allocated by the amount of votes and that's why he voted LP.</comment>

<comment>You're too kind!I am 68 and first voted in 1968 for Humphrey.For a while I voted for Demos, up thru Carter, then switched to Repub at Reagan 1984. I probably voted for Bush I, but not sure.I watched bemused (not amused) at the Perot candidacy and did not vote, but looked with chagrin at Clinton's victory.When it came time to vote for Clinton II (96) I had an exchange on usenet with a Clinton supporter who asked the popular rhetorical question:"Are you better off financially than you were 4 years ago, or not?"Being essentially honest I did not want to lie to the guy and gulped, and admitted that I was, and the implication was that this was a result of the Clinton presidency.Slow on the uptake like always, a couple of weeks later I was mulling over whether to vote for Clinton based on my improved personal status, when I discovered to my surprise that I could have answered "Yes" to this question for each of the previous presidential elections I had voted in, making me begin to wonder if the variable was not national leadership, but what *I*, as an individual, was doing.The more I played around with it, the more likely it seemed that the national leadership had very little to do with how I did, ever.Since then I have been able to say Yes to the same question for each of the last 5 elections, with the exception of 2008, when I had lost about -15% in asset value. So there, in theory, might be a difference, but no "normal" observer (like me) would have foreseen that GW's policy of trying to extend home ownership to first time buyers would explode the way it did.My take away was that unless the candidate elected is blantantly non-centrist (vague term, I realize, but would extend this to all presidents I've seen--even to Obama, who seems relatively close to FDR in executive philosophy) it really won't matter a whole lot to me.And I believe this.So, as a sort of way to motivate myself to keep attending to my own, and my family's, interests, I say "You can expect no help from above; it won't matter much what they do. What you must do is examine the economic rules for each administration closely and optimize the way you proceed."I use this as a sort of motivational mantra, in an an act similar to taking the Eucharist for a Catholic, and I consciously do not vote in national elections. Just to sort of figuratively cut myself off from any notion that national programs will help me in any substantive sense.It is symbolic, you see.[NOTE: There was an exception in 2008; once I understood who/what Palin was, I panicked and voted for Obama. I did not do this again for 2012.]I do vote for local leadership and local measures. I can see where voting on levies can matter to me, personally, at that level.</comment>

<comment>Nice. Do you also feel that the Republican party has gotten a bit over the top recently (since you realized who Palin was)?</comment>

<comment>Public elements are way over the top, but I see Sanders and Trump as very marginal candidates. We know what Sanders would *like* to do, and little of it would help me, and is likely to demonstrably hurt my interests until I learn how to accommodate his ideal system, were it to ever come to pass.Trump hasn't told us anything of substance and this ought to be a BIG concern to anyone considering him seriouslyMy hope is that given enough exposure even the most emotionally driven supporters of a guy like Trump will sicken when (if) they realize what having a Trump-like character in the Oval Office might mean. To start, it would mean a series of yes-men as advisors and nominees to fill administrative positions.He would be a lot like Silvio Berlusconi, except that Berlusconi was better prepared, in that he had at least held public office.But if people can elect Marion Berry and Edwin Edwards *multiple times* they'll elect anyone, it seems.Cruz seems like Trump Lite, and Christie is Trump with a public service resume. Rubio is an unsuccessful Bill Clinton spin-off, trying for the same centrist niche with just enough pizzazz to impress the reactionary elements of the GOP constituency; sorta like Gingrich was, but less smug. None of the others appear to have even a remote chance at this point, but it's still early.Me, it has looked like every man for himself for quite a while now, sorry to say.</comment>

<comment>I always saw Trump and Sanders as irl trolls.</comment>

<comment>Sanders is sincere in his beliefs and has proven such with his past service of his constituents. Trump may be sincere in his beliefs but past service seems to have just served his interests and he's even gotten more self-interested (if possible) since becoming a weekly seen reality tv celebrity.</comment>

<comment>Sanders has a known history of extreme negativity and trolling toward the (legitimate, non-scam related) financial industry.</comment>

<comment>There's the problem with democracy. </comment>

<comment>Democracy has many problems, but what's the better alternative?</comment>

<comment>Democrats and legitimacy don't go together in the same sentence.</comment>

<comment>Good for you. Democrats these days are roughly Eisenhower republicans policy wise, despite what the internet kooks - who represent a small minority - claim.Your proud party has turned totally degenerate and anyone with an ounce of patriotism or decency is with you. Do your party a favor: give them the finger for condescending to you by assuming you're willing to truck with bigots and knuckle draggers.</comment>

<comment>I have always been a Democrat.  What makes you assume otherwise?</comment>

<comment>So you admit that you've always been a misguided idiot?</comment>

<comment>Here's the tribalism!</comment>

<comment>What "tribalism" I think the GOP is full of idiots like the Democrats are.</comment>

<comment>The Tribe of calling anyone not of the same mind an Idiot!</comment>

<comment>Democrats aren't sane people. It's the truth. </comment>

<comment>Then maybe you shouldn't be wasting your time debating with us!</comment>

<comment>In debates Democrats always lose. Because all they say is bullshit and lies.</comment>

<comment>Ah, I see, so you like feeling like a winner.</comment>

<comment>Feeling like a winner because in debates we do win.</comment>

<comment>When you're the judge yes!</comment>

<comment>Non partisan.</comment>

<comment>A  non-partisan that believes all Democrats are insane idiots!</comment>

<comment>They are! Nothing the Democrats say or stand for makes any sense. The GOP is the same way.</comment>

<comment>As I say, people can judge for themselves...</comment>

<comment>And Democrats will lose big time because Obama is a weak terrible president.</comment>

<comment>Perhaps you should run for President?</comment>

<comment>This country is on the verge of being destroyed under Obama and it's on life support.</comment>

<comment>Many people feel that way, but in our country we are free to disagree.</comment>

<comment>People are angy,fed up and frustrated at the way the country has been heading under Obama.</comment>

<comment>Yes, frustration levels are very high on many issues.  People are fed up for many reasons.  Staying calm is not easy on these boards!   I think that attacking one another is counter-productive it just makes us angrier.   But rational debate is very healthy.</comment>

<comment>Where's the Democrats "multiculturalism" and "diversity" At? All I see on their side are three demented white people running for president. Why do Democrats hate Asians,Blacks and Hispanics?  Are they not allowed to run as a Dem? What a racist and bigoted party.</comment>

<comment>The world is very complicated.</comment>

<comment>Obama has zero understanding of it.</comment>

<comment>Judge and jury.</comment>

<comment>And executioner.</comment>

<comment>Jail, if execution seems appropriate for those who differ in opinion, then you have that in common with ISIS.</comment>

<comment>Extreme leftists and extreme righties are both threats to America. ISIS is a threat.</comment>

<comment>We are in complete agreement on that!</comment>

<comment>Whew finally. I apologize for my outburst on you earlier. I was just frustrated you know?</comment>

<comment>Totally understand!  See my other post on that.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the discussion Jail.  It helps to hear other people's ideas.  Don't let people on these boards get you down!</comment>

<comment>I'm glad we were able to settle differences and have a civil  discussion.</comment>

<comment>Normal KidYou state"Its very difficult to stay on top of everything that's happening in politics"That depends.It is hard, if not impossible , to know about every single bill that passes through Congress. But it really isn't that hard to keep one's self fairly informed about American current events and even current world news . And in the age of the internet, its more easy than it's ever been . All you have to do is spend 15-30 minutes a day .</comment>

<comment>As I do (try to spend 15-30 mins at minimum), and for the record I have always been a Democrat.  It is disturbing to me that people routinely assume otherwise.</comment>

<comment>Ummm... I kinda doubt that you can "stay on top" of the developments in every piece of legislation in 15 - 30 minutes a day. There's lots of legislation and if you want to be on top of it, you should at least read it. Which probably means thousands upon thousands of pages of boring dry legislation. Lawyers, who need to know the law, aren't even up on everything all the time. That's why lawyers tend to focus on certain areas of law and avoid practicing in others.And that's just at the federal level. You add on the state level and then local level and all the byzantine laws that that may entail, and you can be all but certain that no one is entirely "on top of everything that's happening in politics."You can more or less on top of politics and laws, but fully informed? Not bloody likely. Not without paid staff and researchers and people briefing you on a regular basis.</comment>

<comment>pete, I certainly agree that one can get information fairly conveniently nowadays.  No need to set aside 6:30 - 7:00 to get the evening news.  But it's not clear that people are capable of becoming informed by surfing the Internet.  Humans have evolved to engage in bias confirmation, and never has it been easier with our current digital media.  I encounter people (all across the political spectrum) that are so invested in their biases that they simply reject any news that does not conform to it and give credibility to any news that agrees with their preconceptions.  It's a part of human nature that takes diligent work to avoid, and even then, most of us only succeed in part.So while I would agree it's is possible in principle to become informed quickly, in practice I find that few people are capable of it.  I try really hard at it, but often fail.  Especially lately, when media outlets are so dependent on getting clicks and publishing hasty articles on hot-button issues designed to generate interest at low cost.  I've been guilty of gravitating to such articles far too often.Technology won't be our undoing as a society; indeed, technology has the potential to make society much better.  I suspect, however, our natural human failings, amplified by the available technology, will ultimately doom us.  But I hope not.</comment>

<comment>Don't let Trump damage your opinion of Conservatism. He is a lifelong Democrat who never mentions Liberty, Freedom, or the Constitution. Real Conservatives are the least racist people in the world. If you are a good friend, a Conservative will be your friend. If you are a bad worker, a Conservative will not hire you. Race and that other nonsense will never enter a true Conservatives mind. We need reasonable people like you to help us get Trump out of the top spot, so we can implement the sound economic policies and preach the philosophy you referred to. With the Democrats, it's cultural and economic suicide. With true Conservatives (Paul, Cruz, Carson, Huckabee, and their ilk), it's a big tasty chocolate bar with a few nuts to pick out along the way.Don't quit!</comment>

<comment>Paul is the only one one your list that I believe is a thinking man, but too much of a libertarian for me.  Carson, Cruz and Huckabee are religious zealots.  Not for true religious liberty as I see it.</comment>

<comment>But it's not hard to say "I don't know" when asked about something you are uninformed about</comment>

<comment>Of course, we all need to say that much, much more often.  But if I'm taking a stand as a voter then I will need to choose.  I'm not shrugging my shoulders and throwing my vote away because I don't know everything there is to know...or because I don't agree with a Candidate on every single issue.</comment>

<comment>That's reasonable to a point, but you should never vote for a candidate just because of their party, and you should never vote on a proposition the way the party you lean towards tells you to just because they said so. That's being a bad citizen.</comment>

<comment>Equality under the law regardless of race or religion is central for me. Until the GOP can rid itself of Christian zealots, xenophobes and bigots then I cannot vote for them.  Parsing out the rest is moot.  But I agree with what you say on making up one's own mind.</comment>

<comment>We ran a similar (actually thorough) experiment in my Political Psychology class.1) We assessed the survey respondents political knowledge (asked them general questions like who was their representative, how many justices are there, who was X vice president, etc) as well as we asked them questions to rate where they were on the spectrum2) We showed them a sheet with a fake congressman and fake and real bills supported by the congressman, half were non-partisan, 1/4 were liberal bills and a 1/4 were conservative bills3) We asked them to recall what bills the congressman supported and what future bills they would support.1/3 of people got the sheet and it had the congressman's party at top as Democrat, 1/3 got the party at the top as Republican, 1/3 didnt get any label (control group)The results were predictably the same, - most people identified as having little to no political knowledge yet confidentially provided answers based on party representation, not actual bills supported</comment>

<comment>I find those experiments silly because this is how humans work: You trust people and delegate decisions to them. When you're told that someone you trust support something, you're likely to support it tooThere is not much more to it; it's basic human psychology</comment>

<comment>And of course it works great to outsource your decision making ... until it doesn't. </comment>

<comment>"Patently unconstitutional" my behind. As Eugene Volokh and Eric Posner pointed out recently, it might be a bad idea, but it's probably not unconstitutional.https://www.washingtonpost.com...http://ericposner.com/is-an-im...The Supreme Court has held consistently, for more than a century, that constitutional protections that normally benefit Americans and people on American territory do not apply when Congress decides who to admit and who to exclude as immigrants or other entrants. This is called the plenary power doctrine. The Court has repeatedly turned away challenges to immigration statutes and executive actions on grounds that they discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, and political belief, and that they deprive foreign nationals of due process protections. While the Court has not ruled on religious discrimination, it has also never given the slightest indication that religion would be exempt from the general rule.</comment>

<comment>I agree that there is no implied absolute right that foreign nationals who are non-citizens of any description are to have free immigration to this country, nor to any other that I am aware of.It's silly for anyone to make that argument and anyone who does leads me to believe that they have no real grasp of national boundaries and what they have meant historically.Now whether or not one approves of the way that national boundaries are traditionally enforced is another issue, but it is not germane to the question of what rights current immigrants might have.</comment>

<comment>A law which instituted a religious test for entry would likely not stand up to the strict scrutiny required when attempting to abrogate the Establishment clause of the First Amendment. Particularly not when there are other ways to achieve the same goal, preventing terrorist attacks, by limiting entry from certain countries.</comment>

<comment>Not to mention that if a terrorist wanted entry to this country they would simply have to pose as a Christian.</comment>

<comment>If they pose as Jehovah Witnesses that's going to really suck.</comment>

<comment>Why would a terrorist pose as someone who's unlikable??</comment>

<comment>It really depends on how expansive you think the Establishment clause is. If you're one of the ultra-literalist conservative types that thinks it just means that the government can't fund churches, and it stops there, then it probably wouldn't bother you. Not that I agree with that, but I can easily see some right-wing judges agreeing that this isn't about any sort of imposition of state religion.</comment>

<comment>When it suits them. But then you get into the arcane shell games of who is funding birth control services and by how many degrees of separation and cutouts, and their view of religious liberty expands considerably. </comment>

<comment>Oh, certainly. You start seeing more twists and bends than a sideshow contortionist. It amounts to pure hypocrisy, but it's hardly new.And that's  really the question you have to ask - do they think this aspect could be turned against them? Since the answer is probably not, I suspect they won't be too worried about allowing religion as a discriminator for immigration.</comment>

<comment>It doesn't matter.  Tens of millions of people share the same sentiment as Trump.  Radical Muslims aren't welcome in the US.</comment>

<comment>And hundreds of millions do not...</comment>

<comment>No, not "hundreds of millions do not."  Over 100 millions Americans share his sentiment.  And gun sales have dramatically increased because the US is incapable of protecting itself.</comment>

<comment>If  the US is incapable of protecting itself then no amount of guns in possession of American citizens will help. If you're referring to law enforcement then I hate to break it to you but someone determined to kill with no regards to their own life will be able to do so, regardless of how many guns are on the street</comment>

<comment>To clarify, the US Federal government is incompetent and unable to keep radical Muslims out of the US, or surveil radical Muslims already in the country.  </comment>

<comment>if parents can't prevent their child from shooting up a school ("we had no idea he was that troubled") what makes you think a government can? The govt could be much more effective but it would also have to be much more intrusive</comment>

<comment>Which is dangerous to the country. To say you do not have a problem with radical muslims coming to this country or staying in this country is shockingly shortsighted.</comment>

<comment>It does matter if those tens of millions don't even equal half their own party which is only 1/3 of the electorate.</comment>

<comment>Radical anyone aren't  welcome in the US. </comment>

<comment>How about just WE THE PEOPLE ?  I do not want to ban anyone but I would like to do searches of every store basement owned by muslims in this country. Open your doors if you have nothing to hide. Make us all feel as if you are on our side.  Nick nack paddy wack give the dogs a bone.</comment>

<comment>I hope the search warrant contains the words, Nick nack paddy whack give a dog a bone. It won't hurt its case.</comment>

<comment>Lol.</comment>

<comment>I would like you to do searches of every store basement owned by muslims in this country.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure it will pay well.  Where do I sign ?</comment>

<comment>Back in the early 1990s, a satorical magazine [I forgot which] asked   several members of Congress what they thought should be done about he situation in Freedonia. All but one made comments  about how its a "complicated issue",ect. It seemed that half of them  didnt know what they were talking about .And knew that they didn't know what they were talking about. And were just bluffing . The other half really didn't seem to realize that they didn't know what they were talking aboutOnly one Congressman that was interviewed, realized that Freedonia is a fictional movie from a Marx Brother's movie</comment>

<comment>As soon as I read "Freedonia" I knew it was from the Marx Brothers but I have no doubt that politicians today would respond the same way as you described.</comment>

<comment>Summary: Polls are worthless.</comment>

<comment>Some are. It depends on the poll, and on whether the question asked is about anything the respondent actually knows anything about. If you ask, "Do you prefer Candidate A or B?" and both are real candidates, you're more likely to get a response that means something.But asking people, right now, to pick a party nominee in states that don't have early primaries is pretty close to useless. We don't have a national primary; we have a series of state ones, and the results of the first ones profoundly influence the results of the later ones.</comment>

<comment>There is a problem with the conclusion. First, again and again it has been shown that polls asking about views and political agreement with causes that attract opprobrium understate support for those views or causes. This has been the case in the UK for UKIP and the BNP, in France for the National Front, Ireland for Sinn Fein and Northern Ireland for the DUP, etc. So realistically, Trump and his anti-Muslim views (and Hispanic/Black) probably get more votes than ordinary opinion polls suggest, not lower as the article suggests.Moreover, anonymous internet polling in this context tends to be more reliable than face to face polling - because it allows people to express views that they would be embarrassed to tell a human pollster.</comment>

<comment>The caveat there, though, is that the internet poll would have to be set so that respondents can only respond once - otherwise, they are too prone to being driven by someone with lots of time and lots of agenda who just clicks, and clicks, and...</comment>

<comment>Perhaps.Look, I have complete contempt for those who'd vote for Trump. Indeed, as someone in international business, I would seriously consider being a Trump supporter as raising questions about someone's employability (xenophobes, racists, homophobes etc. being a problem when dealing with brown, black, gay or non-Christian customers and colleagues.) Ignoramuses that Trumpites may be, a proportion have probably guessed that admitting being one is not a great idea.And that is the polling problem - it's not respectable to be a bigot or an ass...., so many people when asked person-to-person deny their real views. It is quite plausible that polls are underestimating the number of ********* that agree with Trump and will vote with him.</comment>

<comment>How long till one of the usual law school defenders accuses us of being Trump supporters?  I've already been indirectly lumped in with Campos & Tamanaha as being on Cato's payroll by you know who.</comment>

<comment>43% of Americans agree with Trump.</comment>

<comment>Really? My ass says it's 51%.I think you pulled with the wrong hand.</comment>

<comment>He's probably an Arab who pulled with his left hand.Ew!</comment>

<comment>Americans =/= Republicans. Trump has a minority of support from a minority of the population for an idea that can't possibly work. How exactly can you PROVE someone is a radical? You realize they can just get fake documents, ISIL has the resources. Why bother coming in as a refugee when you can just pose as a Coptic Christian?</comment>

<comment>Marseilles, France, the oldest and 2nd largest city in France has accepted muslims for the last 40-50 years and is now considered the most dangerous city in France and Europe, with 60%+ poverty rate. This is the future of many European cities that also made the mistake of accepting muslim immigrants and will be the same for the cities in Canada and the US that accept muslim refugees.It is more moral for the west to help these people to stay in their own home countries, or at least in countries whose people have similar customs and values, than to allow them to western countries.They will not assimilate. They will cost more than they're worth. They will not contribute positively. They do not belong in the west and there are over 100 million people, in the US alone, that agree.</comment>

<comment>What does that have to do with anything I wrote? Please explain in detail how any of that relates to anything in my post.</comment>

<comment>No, you figure it out, and come back with your essay for grading.</comment>

<comment>Typical conservative, deflect and avoid. It's impossible to take you guys seriously when you insist on not speaking plainly and honestly about what you believe. Coward.</comment>

<comment>Typical liberal, deflect and avoid. It's impossible to take you guys seriously when you insist on not speaking plainly and honestly about what you believe. Coward.</comment>

<comment>I'll answer any question you ask, but you clearly aren't willing to make the same promise. Come on, I dare you.</comment>

<comment>So in addition to "I know you are, but what I am?" you're just going to ignore questions you are afraid to answer? Child.</comment>

<comment>How could you have possibly missed the point?</comment>

<comment>Trump makes an outlandish statement to set the outer boundary for negotiations.People freak out but he shifts the conversation.  Now, a two-year moratorium on immigration from countries that house terrorists and an expanded vetting process seems reasonable, compared with "banning all Muslims."It's buffoonish but it works.</comment>

<comment>This makes sense. But the percentage of commenters willing to toss religious liberty out the window is a bit alarming. Until you remember that A) they can't get away with it, and B) there's a non representative sample of extreme partisan commenters here.</comment>

<comment>I would prefer to see the U.S. sharply curtail immigration of all people, regardless of country of origin or religion.  At least for 10-20 years.  I think it would do a lot of good in a lot of ways.So I am glad to see someone raise the topic.</comment>

<comment>It would come at an awkward time, demographically. Our birth rates are tipping below replacement just as the biggest generation of retirees in history is starting to collect Medicare and Social Security. Your proposal would have made better sense a couple decades ago, or a couple decades hence.</comment>

As usual, however politically appealing Republican logic may be here, the details reveal its complete idiocy. If you include "Islam" anywhere in the language of such a bill, you'd be violating the first line of the first amendment.There's just no getting around what a YUGE load of steaming b.s. this "debate" is.</comment>

<comment>Countries that house terrorists" could essentially include any country on the planet ... the details reveal its complete idiocy. Yes, there's just no way to solve this.  We are helpless!   Open those floodgates and let everyone in!</comment>

<comment>Or... Don't base the law on banning people because of their religion.</comment>

<comment>Base the law, instead, on banning people because they have only one eyebrow: e.g., Frida Kahlo.</comment>

<comment>Hey, Frida's my girl. Even if some of her stuff is rather, ah, alarming.</comment>

<comment>Or, have sensible immigration policy where we end up with mostly good people who want to be here, are grateful to be here and want only to work hard and prosper. You know, like we basically already have.Its Trump and xenophobic jerks claiming there's a problem when there isn't. There are no open borders or mobs of invading illegals. These are projected fantasies, not realities.</comment>

<comment>Attention muslims (especially the ones who worked with us over the past fourteen years in the defense of the US): Welcome, work hard, participate in our democracy, assimiliate while maintaining your own culture. Most of us repubs stand with you, not against you (motor-mouthed idiots notwithstanding).</comment>

<comment>Guys we promise that he is gonna lose support. Oh wait, the polls say people support it?What?! Oh well don't trust them lol</comment>

<comment>who cares what a bunch of uneducated mouth breather think? they can support trump and we can ignore their worthless opinions.</comment>

<comment>Thing is I consider myself liberal and I think its a good idea to put a temporary hold on Muslim immigration to review all the applications. It's unfortunate to deny based on religion but we never wanted this problem. It was brought to us. But if we want to be politically correct we can put a temporary hold or slow down on ALL immigration to conduct background checks. But I have a feeling we have to suffer through 2 or 3 more attacks before this type of action gains favor.</comment>

<comment>I think you are probably right...Trump is saying:“Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or non immigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."Title 8, Section 1182 of the U.S. CodeNow we all know MOST Muslims are not terrorists but the reality is, the Muslim community is working out it's issues, "progressing" as a religion..I simply say, let's let them..I simply don't see how importing people with such conflicts into our country or body politic benefits America? It puts us at risk for no reason, none at all that can be articulated...Pause is completely rationale...The alternative is simply not. We have plenty of Muslim American's here not interested in violence until now...Let's assimilate and embrace our fellow Muslim citizens already here, some for generations but importing from regions of real resentment, raw hatred, seems foolish entirely given our current reality...</comment>

<comment>There hasn't been any terrorist attacks committed by Turkish people in U.S., they assimilate well wherever they are, and Turkey is a NATO ally.If you are going to advocate for a ban on Muslim immigration, for the sake of maintaining our important alliance, and peace in Europe, Turkish citizens should be allowed in abit with extra scrutiny.That is the only way I can stomach such a proposal if it acknowledges our special relationship with certain Muslim communities such as the Turks, Kurds, and Bosnians. Your position would be much more palatable in general if it was made more specific and narrow.</comment>

<comment>Given our current reality of having more than enough white young men committing mass killings that we don't need to deal with extra ones who would do it for different reasons? Fair enough.</comment>

<comment>The Trump election campaign is very expensive.His adult children currently overseeing the Trumpgroup of companies are fielding telephone calls fromtheir business partners to place potential deals on holdor cancel any extensions on current contracts.

<comment>The press is always asking the wrong questions.Here is the right question:Why would any American of any political persuasion want to support, defend or promote a religious ideology that legalizes the murder of apostates, the beating of women, the enslavement of captives, the keeping of sex slaves and multiple wives, the raping of children via child marriage and the violent cultural and religious conquest of other people in perpetuity?</comment>

<comment>Hang on, I know this one.1. multiple wives, the raping of children via child marriage - Mormomism (yes, mutilple wives now outlawed, but that's pretty recent)2. wifebeating - sanctioned by Judaic law for "bad" wives3. Christianity spread throughout Latin America and Africa via violent cultural and religious conquest.All three of these example used lines from their holy books to defend their actions.</comment>

<comment>Actually the Mormons were forced to leave the United States in 1844 and settle in the area which would eventually become the Utah territory.  At the time they settled there ,  the area was not part of the US.   Utah was not admitted as a state until 1896 when they officially renounce polygamy and gave women the right to vote.   The LDS church officially banned polygamy in 1890, so your statement that multiple wives  were only recently outlawed , is just plain wrong.In fact , the Mormons are a good example of the US excluding people based on their religion.</comment>

<comment>Not really, they're still here. Regardless, you are talking about the extremes of a religion. All the Abrahamic religions have an extreme. Most deistic religions do too. You make a valid point regarding the President's power over immigration policy, but y'all didn't acknowledge that when Obama did it with the dreamers, of course. My best guess on the legalities of it all is that muslim immigrants could technically be barred from entering the country, but the country couldn't outlaw the whole religion without changing the Constitution, and something tells me the Christians wouldn't like the end result of that.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. Trump isn't proposing banning Islam. Only pausing immigration and visa entry from Muslim countries. And the "dreamers" was ignoring the enforcement of immigration law. The statute you reference doesn't give the president the power to suspend enforcement, only the suspension of the entrance of certain classes of people. Jimmy Carter did this with Iranian nationals. Big difference.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, whatever. I didn't say Trump proposed it, I was talking to the two idiots arguing about the legality of it</comment>

<comment>Neither of them said that banning a religion is legal. You are purposely conflating banning a religion in the country with banning the immigration of a class of people in an attempt to paint the latter as unconstitutional when it's not.</comment>

<comment>Nope, it's constitutional.</comment>

<comment>Why do apologists for religious fascism keep trotting out the same arguments?Fine, a2zmom, since Mormonism once had polygamous marriage for a very brief time, let's overlook the fact that millions of children NOW are being raped by their man-husbands and they are considered legally married by the sharia-ruled nations they live in.Are you a mother? What kind of mother makes an apologist argument for child-rape by attacking a religion that ended polygamy in the 1890s? I just do not understand it. It makes me sick.</comment>

<comment>I answered this but it mysteriously seems to have gotten deleted. You are an apologist for a religion that is causing the oppression, mutilation and sexual violation of millions of women and girls. Your smug deflection is really disgusting and marks you as a person who could really care less about actual people as long as you can score some cheap rhetorical points based on attacking religions that have either long since reformed their practices or never sanctioned what you claim in the first place. </comment>

<comment>Sorry, it's not unconstitutional for the president to ban immigrants from entering the country based on religion. I don't agree with it, but please do your research before you make false claims.https://www.facebook.com/BenSw...</comment>

<comment>why?</comment>

<comment>Upset?</comment>

<comment>more annoyed at conservative stupidity</comment>

<comment>Trump is not going to be President. The entitlement class will elect Clinton, and other liberals thereafter. By the end of the century, your US will have a majority black and Latino population. How do you expect the US to be a successful, prosperous nation, with people capable of solving the complex problems that lay ahead?The rest of the world faces the same problem, less capable people breeding at greater rates than more capable people. This will eventually lead to human extinction...</comment>

<comment>how does a high minority population =  fewer capable people?</comment>

<comment>They have brown skin, silly!</comment>

<comment>Not minority. Blacks and Latinos are breeding at rates that will result in them being the vast majority of the US population by the end of the century.  Please explain how the US will not become like the current latino and black dominated countries.</comment>

<comment>because none of those nations problems are because of the race of their population</comment>

<comment>Really?  Please elaborate.</comment>

<comment>on what? race has nothing to do it any of those  nations problems</comment>

<comment>What are the root causes of those nations' problems?</comment>

<comment>corruption, poverty, apathy</comment>

<comment>That's such a huge question, and the answer would differ country to country. And it's not just one problem. But why would anyone put in the effort of trying to explain when it's clear that you are approaching the question from a historically and scientifically unsupportable framework. Please enter the 20th century, at least.</comment>

<comment>You didn't answer the question.</comment>

<comment>No, I gave you the reason why for you, I'm not going to even try</comment>

<comment>You didn't explain the root causes, if you even know what that means.  The root causes are the characteristics of the people involved in those societies.  They ultimately have control of their outcomes, and they lack will, capacity and desire, all of which are rooted in nature, I.e., their gene pool.The proportion of the world's population comprising less capable people is growing.  That doesn't bode well for mankind.</comment>

<comment>I believe you are only partially correct. Partially correct is still wrong.</comment>

<comment>Because race is a made up social construct, and doesn't determine determines physical or mental ability</comment>

<comment>Welcome to Stormfront Lite, brother!</comment>

<comment>No, it doesnt. I agree with the law, but disagree with how trump wants to use it.</comment>

<comment>It's true! I disagree with Trump's policy, but I'm not going to lie and say it's illegal.</comment>

<comment>I would say just look to what assimilation looks like in the EU (France or UK)...Importing such conflict doesn't make any sense...</comment>

<comment>Assimilation is bad there because of the exclusive structure of their societies, though.  We don't have to repeat those mistakes.</comment>

<comment>F UCK off you stupid troll</comment>

<comment>Truth hurts, huh.</comment>

<comment>what truth?</comment>

<comment>It does? Where? Go ahead and quote the text from the Constitution of the United States of America that says "you can't ban religion under any circumstances" or even something close to what you claim.</comment>

<comment>read the first amendment</comment>

<comment>Non-citizens do not have the same rights as citizens. The Constitution was written to mediate the relationship between the government and the American people. It has nothing to do with non-Americans.</comment>

<comment>it applies to all laws including immigration laws</comment>

<comment>No, it does not. lol The US government can't collect income tax from a tourist. lol</comment>

<comment>no but a tourist can;t be bared because of their faith</comment>

<comment>"Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate."-U.S. Code: 8 USC, 1182"any class of aliens"</comment>

<comment>even that has limits. the president can't bar someone because of their faith</comment>

<comment>Says who? It says "any class". You can't just make stuff up. The law could certainly be changed, but that's what it says right now.</comment>

<comment>the courts and the Constitution</comment>

<comment>You're talking in circles. The Constitution does not apply to non-citizens the way it does to citizens. We already established that when you admitted the government cannot take an income tax from tourists.And the courts have to obey the law. They can't just make stuff up. This is the law.</comment>

<comment>F UCK off, idiot</comment>

<comment>Ah, yes, your only answer when you lack of knowledge and understanding of statutes and legal code falls flat of its face.</comment>

<comment>go F UCk yourself.</comment>

<comment>I've read it. You should give it a try you stupid twat. You sound like Trump when you open your pie hole and let flow opinions that you masquerade as facts and law. </comment>

<comment>F UCK off you stupid troll.</comment>

<comment>Um... What part?  Banning Muslims from entering the country is a stupid, absurd idea.  But, it's constitutional.  The fourteenth amendment doesn't apply to visa applications the way that it does to laws for people in the country.</comment>

<comment>the first, the ones that say you can't pass any laws that restrict a persions right to worship</comment>

<comment>An immigration ban doesn't restrict anyone's right to worship, though (and, actually, it says "free exercise" which is less specific and, I would argue, broader than worship).  It restricts the ability of people who don't have a legal right to enter the country from entering the country.I wish that we would loosen our restrictions on entry to the country, but Constitutionally, the courts seem to have accepted that the government can make whatever rules it wants about who can and can't enter (if they're not citizens or permanent residents and don't already have a visa).  The government can't restrict people's freedom of political speech, but they can and did stop identified communists from entering the US.</comment>

<comment>you need a valid reason to bar someone from immigrating and religion isn't.</comment>

<comment>The legislature and, to the extent that the legislature leaves room, the executive determine the standards.  You might think that such a policy wouldn't be "valid" (and, depending on what you mean by that, I would agree), but there's no constitutional standard... It's left to be determined by the political branches of government, and precedent indicates that the judiciary respects the power of those branches in that regard.There are plenty of laws that are stupid, and some that are even morally repugnant, that are nonetheless constitutional.</comment>

<comment>you need a valid reason to bar someone from immigrating and religion isn't.</comment>

<comment>Actually, the president could restrict someone from immigrating for totally capricious reasons, and it would be legal.</comment>

<comment>So if the other team is against, I am for it, no matter how reprehensible. Felt like the author was trying to muster up an excuse but his heart (or his stomach) wouldn't let him go all the way there. </comment>

<comment>People like talking about how terrible and bigoted it is, and maybe so, but I avoid that sort of value-judgement argument when there's an alternative.  And "banning Muslims" would be ridiculous, ineffective, unenforceable, harmful to our economy and society, and bad strategy in the "war on terror."How would we know who's Muslim?  There's not a religion line on passports.  A terrorist would lie.  And what about the muslim executives of multinational businesses with US offices?  Should businesses put all of their meetings on hold until we "get to the bottom" of whatever we're supposedly trying to figure out?  And what about Muslims from countries with whom we have reciprocal treaties wrt visas?  There are a lot of Muslims in Canada...</comment>

<comment>"How would we know who's Muslim?"Bacon.  Anyone who won't eat a piece of it and also won't swear an oath to Yahweh on a Torah doesn't get let in.  Keeps out Muslims and militant vegans.</comment>

<comment>Mmm...bacon. What was the second part?</comment>

<comment>It scares me to think how many Trump supporters believe this would work. Of course, Trump's own solution was actually worse: asking people if they were Muslim, and barring them entry if they said yes.Foolproof.</comment>

<comment>I think he was kidding... you are missing the sarcasm, especially the Torah part.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, I figured he was kidding. That has no impact whatsoever on what I wrote.</comment>

<comment>I just want to reassure you that you're not at all coming off like an unhinged weirdo. You're doing great.</comment>

<comment>Thank you.</comment>

<comment>My preferred solution was to just shut down all immigration.  That way everyone is treated equally.</comment>

<comment>I'm trying to figure out why anybody would say that. Are you just unaware of how much immigration helps the economy? Are you a supporter of ISIS and trying to undermine the country from within? What's the deal here?</comment>

<comment>"In 2012, 51 percent of households headed by an immigrant (legal or illegal) reported that they used at least one welfare program during the year, compared to 30 percent of native households""Of households headed by immigrants who have been in the country for more than two decades, 48 percent access welfare. ""Immigrant households have much higher use of food programs (40 percent vs. 22 percent for natives) and Medicaid (42 percent vs. 23 percent). Immigrant use of cash programs is somewhat higher than natives (12 percent vs. 10 percent) and use of housing programs is similar to natives.""Welfare use varies among immigrant groups. Households headed by immigrants from Central America and Mexico (73 percent), the Caribbean (51 percent), and Africa (48 percent) have the highest overall welfare use.

<comment>Okay, so you're just unaware of the benefits of immigration. Thanks for clearing that up for me.</comment>

<comment>What benefits?  You don't mention any and I just showed you that the majority of households headed by immigrants use at least one welfare program, which means the majority of these people are a drain on our society.</comment>

<comment>Oh boy. Look, I don't care all that much how little you know about the economy, immigration, or the welfare system. The fact that you can't see ANY benefits to immigrants, and the only measure that you use is the percent who use at least one welfare program tells me all I need to know about your knowledge base in this topic. (Here's an interesting tidbit for you: people working, earning money, and spending money is good for the economy!)At the very least, you could have dug up some conservative think tank study that showed that immigrants are a net deficit to the economy (which would be counter to the majority of research in the area). In any case, a couple of very basic Google searches will get you going.Remember to look at a variety of sources, and have fun learning!</comment>

<comment>I have a policy idea for him, how about declaring war on Saudi Arabia?  They still have not acknowledged their complicity in 9-11, have never prosecuted anyone for it although the plot originated and was financed from there by it's citizens.  They are even still financing Madrasas schools in SA and all over the world that are literally teaching Jihad and radical Wahhabism.   I would love to see the sh*t storm that would start.</comment>

<comment>If you had a choice between limiting immigration and 9/11 (and the resulting wars, resulting losses of liberty, and resulting trillions lost) which would you pick?All the 9/11 terrorist were foreigners let in on weak visa and immigration policies.Its a choice to have weak border security. It makes the few elites very wealthy having open borders. But it opens us up to endless wars.</comment>

<comment>The only polls that matter are the ones where voters vote. All else is slanted bullsnot.</comment>

<comment>Very few support a ban. We support straight talk about radical Islam.</comment>

<comment>If a poll of people were asked the question whether or not we should ban people who support killing gay people for being gay, they would say of course we need to ban them.  If the same people were asked if we should ban people who believe women are second class, the answer would be the same.  We could go on and on with similar question and get the results.  But if you ask the same people if Muslims who have the same ideas and support Sharia Law, they would respond of course not, that would be racist.I guess it is all about how you market your idea.  </comment>

<comment>We could enlist an army of Tumblr feminists if we could convince a few influential ones that to fight the patriarchy they need to end Islamic Immigration.  4chan got them to post pictures of them wetting their pants in public in support of rape victims so they're obviously gullible.</comment>

<comment>Wet their pants.....you're kidding right?</comment>

<comment>#PissforequalityHow much of that was fake accounts by 4chan people versus actual gullible feminists is up for debate, but it strikes me as exactly the kind of vapid shock protest they go in for.</comment>

<comment>I don't care what most Americans support because I don't think most Americans have ever experienced a Muslim neighborhood and until they do I consider them to be ignorant about what implications creating more neighborhoods like that has.  I am curious what percentage of Americans would support a complete shutdown of all immigration.  We have 330 million or more residents so it isn't like we're hurting for more warm bodies here.</comment>

<comment>Racist Nazi KKK bigot!!!</comment>

<comment>Psst, I'm anti-authoritarian.  I don't see much real difference between fascists and communists.  Also I'm Catholic, which last time I checked the KKK wasn't real fond of either.  As to the charge of bigotry, it is you who seems to be intolerant of anyone that disagrees with you as you slander them with hateful names.</comment>

<comment>I'm kidding man, just preempting the sick leftoids.</comment>

<comment>Remember absent some indication from the author parody of extremism is indistinguishable from a sincere expression of it.  In other words, well played.</comment>

<comment>and what happen in "Muslim neighborhoods" you stupid piece of shit?</comment>

<comment>What are you, some kind of bigot racist?</comment>

<comment>go F UCK yourself</comment>

<comment>You must be a Trump voter.</comment>

<comment>go F UCK yourself</comment>

<comment>How was that again?</comment>

<comment>F UCK off, troll</comment>

<comment>Sorry, come again?</comment>

<comment>The same sort of hostility you just illustrated, except unlike on the Internet they'll hurl more than 4th grade insults if they disagree with you.  </comment>

<comment>prove it liar</comment>

<comment>Again, you just did, such hostility.Here's a nice video of how Jewish people need security forces to protect them from hostile Islamic crowds. Nothing says tolerance just shrieking and throwing things at children (starts at about 1 minute):https://www.youtube.com/watch?...What happens if you try and exercise your free speech rights closer to home? You'll get things throw at you (at 2:15 people in the crowd start to suggest using violence and at 2:33 things start getting thrown)https://www.youtube.com/watch?...Watch an Imam strike a British man in his car at 1:46 into this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?...</comment>

<comment>worthless fake propaganda</comment>

<comment>The problem with that denial is I will now link the Court ruling in the lawsuit the folks getting stuff thrown at them at the festival in the video I linked had filed.  So, feel free to come up with some reason to dismiss this as well, since if you don't believe what the video is recording you won't believe words on paper either.http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/op...</comment>
