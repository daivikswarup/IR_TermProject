<comment>I wasn't aware the Republicans had said they would refuse to confirm any Obama nominees. </comment>

<comment>Yes, the frauds and traitors have indicated that they intend to betray the Constitution yet again.</comment>

<comment>You, like all other lefties, and quite adept at acknowledging only the parts of the Constitution which serve your purpose.</comment>

<comment>Like preventing global warming?</comment>

<comment>Hubris as well.</comment>

<comment>The politicization of the selection process for a new Supreme Court justice by the Republicans is outrageous and the epitome of "hubris"..</comment>

<comment>By Republicans? Who invented the term "Borking"?</comment>

<comment>You mean where the Senate in full consideration of a Supreme Court nomination votes against that person?  I believe the Constitution.  It's the Rs that gave it a name.  Refusing to do the work the Constitution requires of the Senate?  That's new.</comment>

<comment>Remember that after Bork was voted down, Reagan sent up Kennedy and he was quite promptly approved on a 97-0 vote.  When George W. Bush nominated John Roberts, 22 Democrats voted to confirm.  When Obama named Kaga, there were only five GOP senators who voted to confirm.  Most of those are now called RINOS by the Republican base.  There isn't some sort of symmetry here.</comment>

<comment>You mean the part about the President appointing a justice to the SCOTUS when there's a vacancy? Sounds a lot like you RWNJs conveniently forget the rules at least as much.</comment>

<comment>And you are adept at betraying the document you claim to revere.  Liar, liar pants on fire.</comment>

<comment>What part of the Constitution, exactly, supports the Senate republicans here? </comment>

<comment>Yes, just like Schumer in 2007.</comment>

<comment>They have the right to not approve any left wing nut job Obama puts up</comment>

<comment>Yes, the Senate has the right to withhold its consent, but refusing to consent and refusing to even consider a nomination, which is what both Sen. McConnell and Sen. Grassley (Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee) said was their plan, are two completely different things.It is an abrogation of the Senate's constitutional responsibility to advise and consent for the Senate to refuse to even consider a nominee. If the majority of the Senate is unwilling to consent to a particular nomination, let those senators vote against confirmation. But vote.</comment>

<comment>And along with rights come responsibilities. Obama's selection will balance the right-wing 'nut-jobs' Reagan and his successors put up during their presidencies. That my friend is democracy in action. What comes round goes round!</comment>

<comment>RWNJs only like the rules until they don't.</comment>

<comment>Obama has a record of recommending reasonable choices. It was GW who recommended someone wholly inappropriate.</comment>

<comment>Yes, many don't pay attention to the news.Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/...</comment>

<comment>Politico is liberal propaganda. Harry Reid sat on Bush's nominations for years.</comment>

<comment>Not as long as the Republicans blocked Obama's.</comment>

<comment>Bush nominated John Roberts on July 19 and he was confirmed on September 29 with 22 Democrats voting for him.  Bush announced his nomination of Samuel Alito on October 31 and he was confirmed the next January 31.  I don't know how 10 weeks and 13 weeks constitutes sitting on nominations for years.</comment>

<comment>After seven years of total fraud and failure, the nomination belongs to the next president.</comment>

<comment>Nope, when the voters re-elected Obama, they had their say. It's obama's to fill.</comment>

<comment>DOA</comment>

<comment>I sure hope so. The shyt for brains repubs,  will play right into Obama's hands. Obstructionism is not a good look going into the election. But then again, I look forward to a democratic senate and dem prez. </comment>

<comment>Obama is not so popular </comment>

<comment>More popular than the senate. Like I said, I look forward to a dem senate. Shyt for brains repubs couldn't boil water.</comment>

<comment>He's under 50 %Majority disapproval All that matters </comment>

<comment>I really don't care what the Luddite home telephone owners think.</comment>

<comment>Ok you're nuts You realize nobody cares what nut jobs like your self thinks Kinda like worrying about what Charlie Mansons viewpoint is </comment>

<comment>Why'd you have to go and do that? You were doing so well.</comment>

<comment>Still more popular than the Senate.</comment>

<comment>They also elected the senateWho gets to approve or disapprove </comment>

<comment>Yep ball will be in their court.  It will not end well for the cons.</comment>

<comment>Not for a Recess Appointee. #sorry. What would Reagan do? - He would appoint a Recess Appointee. Period.</comment>

<comment>Well then Hillary or Bernie will get the next nomination. I think Barack Obama would be a good Supreme Court Justice. </comment>

<comment>Constitutional law professor on that bench works for me. That has been brought up and also that Bernie and Hillary might let the GOP know that is what they will do if there is no cooperation on Obama's nomination. I think they should keep mum and let the Senators stew over it.</comment>

<comment>Hahaha, that would be the best thing ever. Rush's bulbous head might finally explode</comment>

<comment>The only bad thing about that is all the noxious gas that would be released. The environmental impact would be disastrous. </comment>

<comment>Please explain how we've been better off under any recent republican presidents?</comment>

<comment>Depends on your definition of "recent". There were some good things that came out of the Nixon and Eisenhower administrations.</comment>

<comment>There were.  Not what I meant by recent.</comment>

<comment>Repubes will have you believe clean air and water is a bad thing.</comment>

<comment>Strange how the death of one man may save the lives of millions.</comment>

<comment>How many babies do you folks kill every year?</comment>

<comment>The abortion rate is nearly triple in Africa, Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe.</comment>

<comment>I've actually never killed a baby, so my answer would be zero. </comment>

<comment>How many babies do you folks kill every year?Well, the Republicans seem happiest just putting the lead in the water.As for killing babies? I think the answer would be zero.</comment>

<comment>The legal definition of child. ...https://www.law.cornell.edu/us... ..... U.S. Code § 8 -“Person”, “human being”, “child”, and “individual” asincluding born-alive infant.Rights are granted by nation states based on citizenship, which is based first on a certificate of live birth.  As far as terminated pregnancies, the gold standard of information is  https://www.guttmacher.org/pub...**Half of pregnancies among American women are unintended**Do you support sex education, contraception and sterilization coverage in ACA and Medicaid?I have never participated in an abortion, either for myself or another woman. I completely support the importance of a woman being able to choose when she is prepared and able to raise a child. The Guttmacher stats support the inteligence of women's decisions on this.As a critical care RN I worked on post partum floors especially with mom's on IV meds to stop premature contractions before a safe delivery age of the fetus. I subsequently did that as a home care RN also. I worked with a number of nurses who had left working a Neonatal ICU because they fully understood the consequences of early deliveries. Not just from the horrible life in NICU, but from the annual reunions of NICU 'grads'.I also know the consequences of a woman carrying a nonviable fetus to term due to the hazards of labor and delivery. It is an insult to medical professionals to assume they would perform an abortion well past viability for no reason other than the woman suddenly decided she wanted to terminate.</comment>

<comment>Is there anyone else you want dead "for the greater good?"</comment>

<comment>..and how the incarceration of one by the name Gosnell saved so many too.</comment>

<comment>Interesting how the Republicans seem to have as short memory: Less us not forget what happened to the great Thurgood Marshall and his replacement. The greatest progressive thinker of the last 50 years was replaced by Clarence Thomas. What Bush Sr did was appalling, but expected. So, how can the current Republicans (and their base) assume Obama would not follow Bush Sr? Additionally - WWRD - One question: What Would Reagan Do in Obama's shoes. - Well, given Reagan has more recess vacancies than all Presidents in history, he clearly would appoint a "Scalia" of his own kind. Obama in the next day or so will do the same.</comment>

<comment>The question is, who?</comment>

<comment>Probably another bone smuggler like himself. But too bad girls, the gay thing is over.</comment>

<comment>Thomas is greatHe sticks to the law and constitution</comment>

<comment>Obama appoints a lib nut job and a Borking we will go</comment>

<comment>Thurgood Marshall may have been a great progressive thinker, but he was a mediocre Supreme Court Justice.  His place in history will be as the attorney for the NAACP's Legal Defense Fund who argued Brown vs. Board of Education and other key cases before the Court.  He was a great constitutional lawyer, but coasted as a Justice.  He was head and shoulders above Thomas, who had a grand total of 18 months as a judge at any level before being named to the court..  He had never argued a case before the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>CO2=Y2K²x1000Wanting and praying for science's certainty of; "99% real" to be; "as real as causing cancer" for a CO2 Armageddon made "believers" the real rednecks in our children's history books. Deny that.Were your science gods also only 99% certain the planet wasn't flat?Only 35 more years of debate and climate action delay is certain and unstoppable.Smog Warning Days have been rare for decades in N.America and now fracking's abudance is ending the oil wars with affordable energy for many generations to come.</comment>

<comment>What?</comment>

<comment>Why the Y2K reference?</comment>

<comment>Widespread predictions of possible disasters that didn't happen would be my guess.A large part of why there were no Y2K disasters was that many firms and the government spent a lot of money to update and upgrade their computers.  So much so that this triggered a technology stock bubble, which burst very painfully in early 2000 when the updates stopped abruptly.  Many people now insist that much of the money and effort to upgrade computers to avoid Y2K outages was wasted; that we wouldn't have had a huge disaster even if only a small fraction of systems had been updated.Similarly, there have been many and widespread predictions made of climate-change disasters over the past 10-15 years, none of which have occurred as predicted. We had a decade-long, unpredicted "pause" in the increase in global average temperature, which has only recently been explained as due to the (assumed - little data so far) warming of deep ocean water. Then much of the pause was "corrected" away by resetting earlier temperature records cooler.We have not seen massive worldwide investment in either clean, renewable power generation or improved energy efficiency that might have mitigated the predicted disasters. What we've done as a species is to slowly pass environmental regulations in emerging economies where there were none before, but with equal or greater attention to economic issues.  In contrast, the German government has been forced both to curtail their solar power subsidies and also to burn much more, much dirtier coal than before in order to maintain reliable power supplies during their very dramatic Energiewende.</comment>

<comment>I worked on Y2K as part of my regular job.  It certainly wasn't wasted there and I doubt it was a wasted effort in general.  Would you have wanted to take a chance on Y2K, or do it right?There was no pause.  Things are getting worse as predicted.  Do you pay attention at all, read credible articles at all?</comment>

<comment>Congress makes laws not the president</comment>

<comment>They did. Its called the Clean Air Act.</comment>

<comment>The debate is over an EPA regulationNot a law passed by congress </comment>

<comment>The debate is over an EPA reg done under the Clean Air Act.</comment>

<comment>The Clean Air Act required the EPA to make the regulations on limiting green house gases such as CO2.see Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S. 497 (2007)</comment>

<comment>The Clean Air Act required the EPA to make the regulations  limiting emissions of *pollutants* shown to harm human health.Massachusetts v. Environmental Protection Agency, 549 U.S. 497 (2007) allowed the EPA to treat CO2 as a pollutant in a specific set of regulations that also limits emissions of chemicals that are unquestionably harmful to human health, such as mercury. The question "Has CO2 been scientifically proven to harm human health?" could well end up being revisited as a result of the challenges to the Clean Power Plan.</comment>

<comment>That has almost as much chance of happening as Ferguson v Plessy being reinstated.The EPA is tasked with what is environmentally harmful, not just directly harmful to humans.</comment>

<comment>This article illustrates how Scalia's death, whether or not he is replaced soon, casts a huge shadow over the right wing agenda, which relies on the court more and more.</comment>

<comment>Actually they don't conservatives wish the court to do little </comment>

<comment>They wanted the court to overturn Obamacare. They want it to stop Obama's greenhouse gas plan. They want it to overturn Roe Vs Wade. They want it to destroy public unions. To name a few.</comment>

<comment>None of the things you mentioned are legal.They all require activists judges to pass</comment>

<comment>Activist judges? Aren't they the justices that decide the RWNJs are wrong?</comment>

<comment>roe v. wade is illegal?you're saying that supreme court decisions themselves are illegal.  that couldn't make less sense</comment>

<comment>sshhh, you're about to screw up her narrative. Reality will make her very unhappy.</comment>

<comment>So says Joe333, noted legal scholar.</comment>

<comment>Youre a fool if you believe that. Time and time again they fight Obama by going to the courts. Luke petulant children who cry when even the courts say they're wrong.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution fights Obama.</comment>

<comment>Obama has been right more often than not, even with a hostile Supreme Court. Several times, the Supreme Court has had to turn against tradition to obstruct Obama; see recess appointments.</comment>

<comment>The constitution is a piece of paper. Republicans fight him, bring it to the courts, and then cry like babies when they lose.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution is a formal document that has power as a text.I thought Obama cried like a baby when the 2nd amendment upsets him.</comment>

<comment>Awww, that's pathetic. You could not muster an intelligent response so you went for your punching bag. My point still stands. Have a good day.</comment>

<comment>Calling the Constitution a piece of paper is supposed to be an intelligent response?</comment>

<comment>"The Constitution fights Obama."  Is that one?"Obama cried like a baby when the 2nd amendment upsets him" that one is just completely irrelevant and clearly an evasion to the fact the republicans constantly bring fights to the court AND LOSSSSEEEE.</comment>

<comment>When a court is stacked with justices that consider the Constitution (or other legal documents) as "living" of course Progressives will get more activist rulings.</comment>

<comment>Yup. Tough cookies. That's how the system works. We had a conservative court for 30 years or so. You don't think liberals always hated that?</comment>

<comment>A court should always be Conservative. That is the role of a Court. If you want progressives put them in the legislature.</comment>

<comment>That is not the role of a Court. Your use of "conservative" and "progressive" make me laugh only because it is clear you mean them as "obstructionists" and "do-ers".That aside, progressive Justices have a respect for the constitution as much as a conservative Justice.</comment>

<comment>We are talking about government roles. The best "do-ers" are in the real world, in the free market, in homes and communities. The government is a limited role. It is intentionally "obstructed" by design. There are checks and balances. That is the genius of the founders. Sure, call Conservatives that follow this genius, "obstructionists" if it makes you feel better.</comment>

<comment>WOW! What nonsense is coming out of your finger tips?1. "Obstructionist" refers to politicians like Ted Cruz who allowed the government to shut down rather than fulfill his duties because he wasnt getting what HE wanted.Or like Mitch McConnell who would rather have a vacant seat on the Supreme Court for over a year (UNHEARD of in history) than fulfill his duties to give a nominee a hearing.2. Everything you said about our government being intentionally obstructed is COMPLETE AND UTTER BULLSHEET. You clearly have no understanding of basic civics.</comment>

<comment>Are you talking about the Obama-Reid Shutdown? The Republicans in the House sent over multiple bills to keep government open, but Reid refused again and again to vote on them.The Senate's Constitutional role is to advice and consent for Judicial appointments. If Obama refuses that, checks and balances haven't been effective. Take a year. That would be fine. The government is SUPPOSED to be slow. That is how it was design. It's hands are tied so the people can be free.But Progressives have a faulty view of government. They worship it and want it to do everything for them. That is not the Constitutional system we have."Checks and balances" look it up. It is really the genius of Conservatism and America as a nation.</comment>

<comment>Ignoring all your nonsense, "The Senate's Constitutional role is to advice and consent for Judicial appointments. If Obama refuses that, checks and balances haven't been effective"How does Obama "refuse that"?? He chooses a nominee and they vote on it.You CLEARLY do not even know how the supreme court nomination works.Stop what you're doing, log off and OPEN A DAMN BOOK!Stop spreading your ignorance and patchwork knowledge of the constitution and actually do some research. Good bye.</comment>

<comment>The Senate can give advice on which nominee to choose.</comment>

<comment>That is true, but it comes off as petulant for senators to openly declare (before any choice is proffered, by the way) that they will block anyone the president may choose based on their dislike of him. That sounds like a dereliction of duty to me.</comment>

<comment>It is no more a dereliction of duty than what the Democrats did to Bork. And that was much farther out from the end of the term.</comment>

<comment>I would hope our leadership is more mature than "they did it to us, so we will do the same to them." I know politics is petty, but two wrongs don't make a right.</comment>

<comment>Who is saying it is wrong? The Senate has the Constitutional power to confirm a Justice.The senate is Republican-led, so if there is no nominee that align's with the Republican respect for the Constitution there should be no confirmation.It is the whole I'll cut the pie in half and you choose the piece you want exercise. Obama gets to cut the pie, but he had better choose an Originalist (someone that respects the Constitution and doesn't consider it "living"). If he is unable or unwilling to do so, the next president can.</comment>

<comment>I don't see the logic in that, as there are a vocal number of senators that seemingly have little to no actual respect for the constitution (this whole episode is an exercise in that). Also, I don't see him having to choose an originalist. He should pick the person that he feels will do the job best; no matter what sort of judicial mindset they have. I don't claim to know what is in the hearts of the drafters of the constitution, but I don't think that matters. It was meant to be a document that can be interpreted to fit with changing times, as we have seen 27 instances of.</comment>

<comment>He should not pick the person he feels will do the job best. It is not about feelings. He should pick the person that the Republican-led Senate advises is the most able to uphold the Constitution.But he is a Progressive so he likely will go by his subjective feeling and try to get it through by power play. No formal document after it has been written down is meant to be treated as meaning something entirely different from the words in it mean.The whole concept of the Constitution as a "living being" is something an insane person might think, but Progressives use if to cheat and give their non-constitutional policies some unfair weight.The amendment process is for the changing times; the judicial frankenstein approach is for left-wing pushes towards tyranny.</comment>

<comment>Our Constitution lost a lot of that power when you authoritarian cons put it thru the shredder known as the Patriot Act.</comment>

<comment>Punctuation; it's a thing. Look into it! </comment>

<comment>Conservatism relies on the conserving the Constitution. It is the Progressive agenda that relies on the "living" interpretation of the Constitution to get through crazy ideas that would never pass the amendment process.Justices that defend the Constitution are not right-wing, but it helps the right-wing. Justices that progress beyond the Constitution are left-wing progressives, and the Progressives depend highly on such tricky business.</comment>

<comment>So you aren't taking the medication your doctor prescribed. Remember, they said you could stay out of the hospital only if you behaved and took your medication. You don't want to have to go back to the hospital, do you?</comment>

<comment>Scalia was really the only justice who claimed "original intent," and pretty much the only one who thought he could conjur up what was meant by whom in the 18th century when in many cases, the Founders were deliberately obscure. The 2nd amendment alone has driven people nuts over the years.What you think you are defending is a method of interpretation of the constitution, not "the constitution."</comment>

<comment>It's pretty simple The onus is on Obama to nominate someone that will get approvedI fail to see the perceived liberal advantage here </comment>

<comment>Shyt for brains repubs will look like the degenerate whiny losers they are.</comment>

<comment>Ok idiotic comment Exactly how do you think Obama will get a nominee through </comment>

<comment>I'm hoping the cons will obstruct and leave it open for a year.  The resulting dem presidency and senate will get the job done.</comment>

<comment>We'll see You seem extraordinarily optimistic but hyper partisans usually areDo you desire a monarchy?Do you think your guy or gal will always be king ? Pretty naive if you do </comment>

<comment>The only one that thinks they will be king, is Trump. "I will make Mexico pay for a wall" " I will make Iran stop its nuclear program" I will make Apple and Ford onshore" </comment>

<comment>Surprisingly I agree re Trump but think that Hillary also has queeny ideas</comment>

<comment>Yes, you would think that. Simply because that is what the RWNJs all hear from their masters. None of you morons are capable of thinking for yourself.</comment>

<comment>The media always attempts to make them look this way. Many myopic people buy it.</comment>

<comment>The theoretical advantage is as follows:1. President Obama names a moderately liberal nominee, someone along the lines of First Circuit Judge Srinivasin - someone not readily pigeonholed as a liberal lion;2. Republicans refuse to even consider the nomination, either Sen. Grassley refuses to bring the nomination to hearings in the Judiciary Committee or Sen. McConnell refuses to bring the nomination to the floor;3. The refusal to even consider the nomination of a moderate looks bad to moderate independents, and plays directly to the Democratic assertion that the Republicans have been an obstructionist force since day one of President Obama's administration and drives up Democratic turnout; 4. With moderate independents angry and high Democratic turnout, the Democratic nominee wins the Presidency, and the Democrats re-take the Senate, allowing the next President, whether Clinton or Sanders, to nominate someone dramatically more liberal than Judge Srinivasin, for example Chief Judge Dianne Wood of the Seventh Circuit; and5. This causes a major swing of the Court's ideological balance to the left, rather than the more minor swing that would be cause by replacing Scalia with a moderate like Judge Srinivasin.That's how the theory goes.</comment>

<comment>But it doesn't matter if any of that actually happens. It matters if the media can convince its followers. No matter what the Republicans do, the media will try and spin as much as possible to demonize them. But more and more people are becoming reactionary against the media bias. For example, the more the media hates Trump, the more popular he becomes.The Republican-led Senate may fall for your strategy and approve Obama's poor choice of a nominee, but that will just push more voters to a populist non-establishment candidate. This would elect Trump who would get to pick Ginsburg's and likely another replacement, and have a Republican senate to approve a justice that treats the Constitution as meaningful instead of "living." I doubt Trump would go for the nonsense of a loose constructionist nominee. </comment>

<comment>It isn't what the media does; it's what the Republicans in the Senate do.The RWNJ media will spin this as an Obama screw-up regardless. The main stream media will present this as what is really happening. A lot more people follow the main stream media than follow the wing nut media.McConnell is already on record as not wanting to bring any nomination to the Senate. He forgets that Obama was voted in with majorities, twice. He forgets that Obama is the President. It will take a lot of spinning to walk that back or spin it in any meaningful way. Just because it sounds good to the RWNJs doesn't mean it will sound good to America. Especially when so many of them are so in favor of  wing nuts likeTrump.</comment>

<comment>The Constitution gives power of advice and consent to the Senate. McConnell is entirely within the Constitution role when advising Obama not to make the nomination a contentious issue, and wait until after campaign season is over.</comment>

<comment>If Obama is the one tasked with choosing the next Supreme Court Justice, then it is his obligation to nominate someone. McConnell is to evaluate Obama's nominee, not to tell him not to make an appointment. McConnell is not the Senate, he is but one Senator.The world doesn't stop just because there is an election. So you still hate America and the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>Nomination is not a mere instance; it is a process, sometimes a long process. It is in the interest of many of the Senator's constituents to not overly politicize or rush the process, especially when in a contentious campaign season.The Constitution has checks and balances for a reason.</comment>

<comment>So you don't understand the Constitution. Gotcha.</comment>

<comment>The "living" Constitution or the actual Constitution?</comment>

<comment>THE Constitution as written and interpreted by the Supreme Court.</comment>

<comment>interpreted by the Supreme Court Justices that treat it as "living" or the Supreme Court Justice that treat it as it actually is?</comment>

<comment>The power to advise and consent is not a power to advise as to whether to make a nomination at all. It is a power to advise and consent as to who the nominee ultimately is.</comment>

<comment>The advice is not to avoid nomination, but about timing it well.</comment>

<comment>Well, when the right has had a vacancy, they've moved promptly to fill it. The rules should be the same for both sides.</comment>

<comment>There is no ability to choose the timing. Justice Scalia died, that creates the timing. The Republican version of "timing it well" seems to be 'don't nominate at all'. Whatever you may think of him, Obama remains president for another eleven months, and won't even enter his lame-duck period until after the election in November. If Scalia had died after the election, but before the new president was inaugurated, there would be an argument that he lacked the moral authority to nominate, but we aren't there  yet.</comment>

<comment>He can nominate. The most fair response is to simply Bork the nominees.</comment>

<comment>If the Senate is unwilling to confirm a nominee, then, as you say, reject the nominee in an up or down vote. But that isn't what Sens. McConnell and Grassley are talking about. They are talking about flatly refusing to even hold confirmation hearings, let alone bring the confirmation to the floor of the Senate.</comment>

<comment>It takes a bunch of months to get those types of things going. It is the government we are talking about; of course it is slow. That is the point. The U.S. government was designed to be limited. That is the genius of the Founders. Having 8 Justices for a while is no big deal. The Supreme Court shouldn't even be doing much at all anyway. In general there is nothing all that important for the government to rule on. The real important decisions are going on in homes, communities and the free market.</comment>

<comment>Having only eight justices actually really is a big deal. 4-4 decisions mean a non-precedential affirmation of the lower court decision, which presents serious problems in the event of, for example, a circuit split. There would wind up being a situation in which a circuit split can't be resolved because both circuit appeals courts are affirmed without precedent.It may be  your view that in general there is nothing "that important" for the Court to rule on, but I think the people whose rights are in issue, for example the people who need to know if it's a crime or not to refuse to take a roadside breath test, might disagree that there is nothing important.</comment>

<comment>There is nothing magical (or in the Constitution) about 9. It may be a big deal for legal wonks, and law nerds. But such esoteric issues of the law don't (or shouldn't) matter to the vast majority of people. If they matter that much that is a bigger problem. The government should mostly be out of our lives. How often are people worrying about circuit splits around the dinner table? And what is so bad about a circuit split? Celebrate diversity.I would welcome a lot more circuit splits.My point is that if the make up or details of the SCOTUS effects our lives that much there is an imbalance of authority which is a much bigger problem. The SCOTUS deserves to be put in its place and lose some of its significance.Here is some much needed wisdom on the issue:https://mises.org/blog/abolish..."The concept of judicial review is a fabrication by the Court, with no basis in Article III. Constitutional jurisprudence is not constitutional law.The Supreme Court is supreme only over lower federal courts: it is not supreme over other branches of government.Congress plainly has constitutional authority to define and restrict the jurisdiction of federal courts.""Congress could also decide that the Supreme court is made up of one justice or 100 justices."</comment>

<comment>It's not the number 9 per se that's magical, its the importance of having an odd number of justices to avoid ties and non-precedential affirmations. As for what is so bad about circuit splits, circuit splits are bad when they are dealing with the interpretation of federal law. It is a real problem to have two different circuits giving different interpretations of the same provisions of federal law, because then you have two citizens, bound by the same federal law, but with that law meaning two different things, depending only on where the citizens live. Something could go from being a crime to not being a crime under federal law just because someone went from, say, New Mexico to Arizona. It's not about diversity, its about making sure that a single piece of federal law, or a single provision of the Constitution, means the same thing no matter where in the USA you are.While the author of the blog you link to is correct that the basis for judicial review in American law is the decision of the Supreme Court in Marbury v. Madison at the beginning of the 19th century, the concept of judicial review is much older. In the 13th century, King Henry II of the England established the Court of Kings Bench in order to create a more evenly applied system of law in England. The Court of Kings Bench was given the power to issue various prerogative writs, which formed the basis of what is now known as judicial review, including mandamus, in which a person or organization is ordered to do a thing, and certiorari, in which a person or organization is ordered to explain why it did a thing. Those two writs, from their ancient origins, provide the legal underpinning of judicial review in every system that is derived from the British Common Law including the UK (obviously), the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Nigeria, Israel, India and many more. Legal systems based on the Napoleonic Code (and through it the codified law of the Roman Empire) have judicial review as well. Every legal system in the world has some form of judicial review, because it is required to ensure that government action is kept to its constitutional limits.The only way to eliminate judicial review would be a constitutional amendment to that effect. That could have been done after Marbury v. Madison if the legislators of the time (many of whom were veterans of the Revolution) had thought it was inconsistent with the constitutional scheme.</comment>

<comment>I don't agree with you regarding the role played by "the media" and I don't think you can speak about "the media" as a monolithic block today as you could twenty years ago. While the left wing media (MSNBC and various internet outlets) may push the line that the Republicans are obstructing no matter what they do, by the same token the right wing media (Fox and co) will push the line that Obama has appointed a flaming radical Marxist who makes Lenin look like a conservative no matter what Obama does.I also don't agree that the Senate confirming a moderate liberal justice would cause a dramatic increase in "non-establishment" vote. Even if it did, I don't think it can be said that vote would only go to Trump. Sanders draws Democrats and left-wing independents who are upset with the Democratic Party establishment.</comment>

<comment>Look at how the media handled the Obama-Reid government shutdown as a case in point.We'll have to wait in see the effect of the establishment rejecting the will of their constituents. That seems to be a major theme at the moment. People are rejecting the more establishment candidates on both sides. While the "establishment" forcing an unwanted Justice onto the people may seem likely, not matter how the media spins it, it'll only push more people towards the populist candidates.And Sanders (or any Democrat) has no hope without ample establishment and media support. A non-establishment Republican has the will of the people (not just college students) on their side.</comment>

<comment>Again, I don't agree. I don't think any of the available facts bear our  your argument.In the first place, there was blame to go around on the shutdown, and who got the blame depended on what media you were consuming. Fox and right-wing internet media placed the blame on Democrats (as you do), CNN did their usually slapdash reporting doing no one any credit, and MSNBC and left-wing internet media placed the blame on the Republicans.I also don't think the evidence bears out your arguments re who "non-establishment" voters and "the people" support.</comment>

<comment>Why is Sanders do so well in Democrat primaries? At this rate Sanders should be winning the Democrat nominee, unless there is tricky business (which there always is with Democrats).Why is Trump doing so well in Republican primaries?</comment>

<comment>The tricky business is in the superdelegates, a system deliberately designed to weaken the control rank-and-file members can exercise over the Democratic Party.</comment>

<comment>And if the DNC demonstrates the kind of elitist tyranny they prefer in their own party, why should we let them get power in the government to enact the same kind of elitist tyranny?</comment>

<comment>I don't want to elect Rep. Wasserman Schultz to anything. Fortunately, she isn't running for President. And the Republican candidates are so detached from reality that either of the Democrats would be better.</comment>

<comment>detached from reality, or don't you mean detached from "reality"There is a reason someone like Trump is appealing to the populous. He is speaking about and from reality. He is not a product of political myopia.Clinton is deep in the establishment (super delegates and all) , and Sanders is just far out there (even the NYT says his economic ideas contain "a very worrisome amount of voodoo.")But you say either of the Democrats would be "better"?</comment>

<comment>Dems fail to realize that they hold neither house of congress nor the vast majority of state governments They seem to think that Obama is kingHe's not and if there is any doubt he'll soon find out he is indeed not king </comment>

<comment>Once the midwest cuts off their food supply the liberals will come around.</comment>

<comment>Much of the Midwest is "liberal." And the farmers do like their liberal provided price supports.</comment>

<comment>Say it ain't so. Farmers actually like welfare?</comment>

<comment>He's not King. He's president and article 2 says he can nominate a justice.You fail to realize that 9 out of 12 federal courts are liberal. If there is no 9th justice, those lower courts decisions stay. It's a win-win for Democrats.</comment>

<comment>A number of essentials issueshere.     First, the Supreme “Court” istreated as the absolute, as the ultimate, as the final determinant oftruth and falsity.  What the Supreme “Court” says is utterly andcompletely true, the utter verity, which cannot be questioned. Something which is not subject to opinion or partisan prejudice,something which was arrived at not by opinion or partisan prejudice. It is the undeniable fact.     That is the lie they keep sellingus.     Homosexuals are not psychotics and“marriage” of homosexuals is not an affront to decency.     Marijuana is not a danger tosociety and everyone should be an addict.     Abortion by craven whim is notmalignant.     Now, it is openly opined by TheAtlantic the idea of Obama stacking the “court” so it will seethings his way.  The “Court” previously said that objections toObama's environmentally framed swindle needed to be heard, before any“judgment” made.  Now, The Atlantic openly proposes, Obama canmanipulate membership so that what he wants to be declared “absolutefact” will be declared “absolute fact”.  In other words, TheAtlantic is admitting that the results of the Supreme “Court”always were partisan and any pretense that they were anything otherthan engineered is a lie to the people.  There is absolutely nothingthe Supreme “Court” said that deserves to be taken to be anauthentic and legitimate “interpretation” of the Constitution. They were all lies by the “Justices” to pay off those who gotthem that plum job!     Interestingly, too, The Atlanticmade such a declaration openly, as if conniving to cravenly engineer“government” to promote Liberal party particular scams isentirely legitimate.  The Liberal party seems too full of itself andconfident that it will never be brought up short legally for betrayalof the society of the United States for personal profit.</comment>

<comment>The "Liberal party"?The current legislation states a court of nine people. When there is a vacancy, it is the President who nominates the person to fill that vacancy. That is in the Constitution, whether you like it or not. That is NOT stacking the deck.The good news is Obamacare does cover mental health treatments. The bad news is you don't seem to have taken advantage of that fact.</comment>

<comment>A connivance of the Liberalparty.     When the “law” does not fittheir agenda, they declare, “unjust laws do not deserve to befollowed”,  When it does fir their agenda, they say “that's thelaw and you have no choice”.     Just because something is “inthe Constitution” does not necessarily mean it is just or decent ornot connived.  Remember, the Constitution was written only by therich, and for the rich.  The rich never lost money, under the controlof the Constitution, and those without a lot of money have neverfound a friend, in a journey to riches, in the Constitution.  Ifanyone thinks that making the assigning of “Justices” to theSupreme “Court” a job for the president does not automaticallyopen the door to partisan machination, they are either a liar or, atbest, so gullible, they cannot be considered necessarily not a threatto their own welfare.  Indeed, the article itself discusses the ideaof a “Justice” being chosen to promote Obama's agenda and Mr.Fusion actually wants to pretend like that isn't a consideration andoption.     I said before and I say again, itis a lie peddled to us that the decisions of the Supreme “Court”are necessarily unquestionably noble, honest, valid, non partisan,non connived “interpretations” of the Constitution rather thanmeans to “validate” swindles being perpetrated by either party.</comment>

<comment>You do realize that applies to many conservatives? "Patriots" especially have been in the news lately for breaking laws they disagree with. The first step in this discussion is to understand that both sides have bad actors and both sides have patriots. The news services trying to make people hate their neighbors are doing no one a favor.</comment>

<comment>It kind of shocks me too, the headlines I see that interpretation of laws and the constitution is purely a political maneuver now.The Supreme Court has been losing respect and will continue to do so if courts legislate from the bench.</comment>

<comment>YES! We control the horizontal, we control the vertical...WE CONTROL EVERYTHING!!!!Obama should ram through EVERY court case and get this country TRANSFORMED before the next election, because once the country is transformed...ELECTIONS DON'T MATTER!! The PROGRESSIVES RULE!!! End of line...</comment>

<comment>Gridlock governance now extends from the Legislative branch to the Judicial branch.</comment>

<comment>I dont consider it gridlock if the representatives of the people refuse to pass legislation to the king's liking.System seems to be working as intended with checks and balances.</comment>

<comment>Do you know what checks and balances are? because the SC are the ones who referee.</comment>

<comment>They arent supposed to legislate from the bench nor are bureaucrats supposed to "interpret" new legislation into existence but i hardly care any more lol.  We lost our republic a while back.  Who gets to nominate the next supreme court justice makes no difference.</comment>

<comment>Just because you did not get the decision you wanted, doesn't mean they are legislating from the bench. This vile way viewing the SC like they are even remotely concerned about petty politics is what I always hear when conservatives don't like the result.Maybe, JUST MAYBE, you were just wrong.</comment>

<comment>I am not a conservative lol.  But I do have an issue regarding viewing the constitution as a "living breathing" document lol.   But like i said it doesnt matter.  It seems pretty clear when one looks at debt projections for the next ten years we are going down the tubes soon lol.  Who cares who gets to nominate the next set of politicians on the supreme court?</comment>

<comment>The founding fathers were not gods.  American society has progressed in a positive direction precisely because we do not allow ourselves to be strictly bound by what people thought 200 years ago.</comment>

<comment>Do you think that Scalia's position on the environmental issues and then going out the hunt, gave God the opening to call him in for a little face-to-face.</comment>

<comment>So you're a Republican, you supported Robert Bork, and you're a racist. Ah, but I repeat myself!!! Message received, Ishmael out.</comment>

<comment>That's actually not how it happened last time.</comment>

<comment>A scenario right now regarding the death of Scalia: IF there was a Republican President, with a Democrat Majority in the House & Senate.  You Democrats would be obstructing the Republican President.  See how this works?!</comment>

<comment>you can think what you like but that is not how it has historically played out with our current Chief Justice Kennedy.</comment>

<comment>You're right. If the positions were reversed, AND the Democrats did NOT act they way they did last time and in fact vowed to NOT ratify the President's choice, then they would be acting like obstructionists like the current republicans. But the forced analogy breaks down because when the situations were reversed, the left obeyed the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>The democrats could always pass laws in a constitutional manner by gaining enough support from the representatives of the people.Obviously when you have bad policy like this the public doesn't support it though so I guess corrupt judges are your only option</comment>

<comment>You're forgetting that the supreme court is who told the EPA to regulate carbon emissions in the first place.</comment>

<comment>Ah, I guess one really needs to practice hard for that.</comment>

<comment>Mostly wingnut morons down below, so I hesitate to ask a substantive question, but here goes:The existing stay that the 4-4 deadlock preserves covers a specific set of EPA regulations.  If the EPA put forward an additional, similar set of regulations, would it be subject to the stay without further SCOTUS action?  Prior to Scalia's death, the response from the Court would have been scathing; but now things have changed.</comment>

<comment>Newly issued regs couldn't necessarily be stayed without further SCOTUS action.  But it only takes 4 justices to issue a stay, and attempts to render the Supreme Court case moot by such obvious regulatory agency overreach is likely to piss off even those justices who approve in principle of the EPA regulating CO2.</comment>

<comment>You obscene ideologues couldn't be happier about the death of a fine man and protector of the Constitution if you murdered him yourselves...appalling.</comment>

<comment>The president has simply said he'll recommend a replacement in due course. It's people like Mitch McConnell on the right who are saying they will ignore the law and ignore precedent and block anyone the President recommends. Truly appalling. If you are seeing stories about people happy Scalia died, you're watching news intended to anger and manipulate its viewers.</comment>

<comment>Both situations are wrong. I read the most disgusting things--things I could never have imagined for my worst enemies--from the Party of "Love and Peace" over the weekend about Scalia's passing that it reminded me that there are vile people of every persuasion. McConnell is just a tool and always has been a tool.</comment>

<comment>Welcome to the internet. The porn is that way.</comment>

<comment>It's pretty much every way but here.</comment>

<comment>Ain't that the beautiful truth.</comment>

<comment>Not his death but relief he is no longer on the Supreme Court contributing to horrendous decisions.</comment>

<comment>Faithfulness to the Constitution, horrendous? You will someday lose all your rights thinking this way.</comment>

<comment>No, decisions like Citizens United, Health Care, The recent EPA regulations, and Gore vs Bush come to mind.  Bad for the country and its citizens.</comment>

<comment>Last thing with need is more power given to unelected beurocracies.</comment>

<comment>Good Lord, what an incoherent response. Setting aside the garbled language and spelling, the "bureaucracy" is executing the orders of a twice-elected official, the President of the United States, and the roadblock hindering those orders was erected by the SCOTUS, none of whose members were elected.</comment>

<comment>The President does not make law. That's the legislators job. Unelected bureaucracy certainly does not make law. SCOTUS upheld the Constitution.</comment>

<comment>"...Obama's Clean-Power Plan..."So you do have every intention on pushing your agendas through a supreme court of 8 new york and california jews and catholics.</comment>

<comment>So,how does this group of two geographic locations and two religions break down? Is it even-steven between Jews and Catholics? Are they bi-coastal, or unevenly divided between NY and Cali? Or is it 4 NY Jews and 4 California Catholics? Did Scalia tip the balance toward the Papists? You often make this comment, so for some reason I'm trying to understand how this group of 8 is set up.</comment>

<comment>No. The Supreme Court must defer to the legislative branch.</comment>

<comment>The president has the limited role of mere nomination. That is all. The Senate gives the advice and consent. This is a case where the Republican-led Senate should advice Obama of who and/or when he should nominate. And it should be a Scalia equivalent. Checks and balances are there for a reason.</comment>

<comment>"The president has the limited role of mere nomination. That is all."Now tell me,who allowed a supreme court of 8 new york and california jews and catholics?</comment>

<comment>The previous Senates not checking and balancing enough.</comment>

<comment>Don't bother. mintap understands Article 2 less than a child.</comment>

<comment>You're advising a KKK member on how to interpret the Constitution?</comment>

<comment>Who did that?</comment>

<comment>Nothing in the Constitution requires that once a justice is appointed that for eternity anyone who replaces him must be a clone. Lifetime appointments are bad enough.</comment>

<comment>nor is there a requirement for the number of Justices.</comment>

<comment>Lifetime appointments are bad enough. Well said. But how about the lack of term limits on senators and house members? Think McConnell.</comment>

<comment>True. I'm all for term limits. And for preventing Congress from passing laws that give them better treatment than their fellow citizens.</comment>

<comment>No thanks. Once more unto the breach, ratf***er.I mean, the demographics are looking bad enough for y'all, but would it be too much to ask for an outbreak of the Spanish Flu? I can assure you that we won't spend too much time mourning the members of the 'b@gger generation.</comment>

<comment>On the bright side, rats have moved out of the neighborhood for less friendly turf.This looks bad for squirrels though.</comment>

<comment>I'd love to hear you repeat that argument when there is a Republican in the WH.</comment>

<comment>But Republicans tend to prefer judges that uphold the Constitution. Democrats tend to pick judges that treat the Constitution as "living" (i.e., able to rubber stamp Democrat policy errors, and rights violations).It is apples and oranges.</comment>

<comment>Since Obama cant get laws passed to his liking it appears the bureaucrats have been given free reign to "interpret" legislation into existence.Necessity, the plea of tyrants lol.  </comment>

<comment>I know the English language is a bit beyond most wingnuts, but in English we say "free rein", as in letting the horse go its own way.  "Reign" has to do with monarchs, or maybe tyrants - but you would be more familiar with tyrants, since most of the people running on your side seem to qualify.</comment>

<comment>Never talk theology with a Sub Genius cult member unless you want to be raptured by JHVH-1.You may wish to move out of state and change you name and hair color.</comment>

<comment>Lol.  Dam auto correct.Tyrants abound on all sides.  Necessity is always their plea.  Who needs a constitution or the rule of law when you know you are right?</comment>

<comment>HA HA HA .... Neither Hillary or Bernie will ever get to appoint a Justice</comment>

<comment>One interesting aspect of this is that the Repubs' calculations may change by midsummer. Especially if their chosen standardbearer by then is either Trump or Cruz, which is probably around 70% likely, and Hillary, probably 85% likely, is on the other side.What will the Senate do if the polls show Hillary is almost certain to win, and likely to bring a Dem Senate majority with her? Which seems around 65% likely to be the case by August, given how unpopular with swing voters both of those men are.Will the Repub Senators decide to accept a moderate Obama nominee they get a say on, or hold out, looking bad to independents, for another six months on the chance that a miracle occurs and they get a better hand by January? At the risk of a truly liberal justice sent up by Hillary to a new Dem-controlled Senate? And at the cost, probably, of another two or three Republican Senators in blue-in-Presidential-year states, which would probably be enough to cost the Repubs the Senate if they haven't already lost it?You can just imagine the perfectly accurate campaign ads pointing out to women that they're almost certain to lose their freedom to choose (abortion, of course) within a year or two if a Repub is elected President. And how unbelievably convenient for the candidate if the alternative on offer is also the first female President.This is only beginning to get interesting, if McConnell doesn't back down quickly and let a moderate Obama nominee get through to an up or down vote.</comment>

<comment>Depends; has anyone even suggested a possible "moderate" Obama nominee? Virtually everyone I've seen thrown out as a possibility is a left wing progressive of different noise levels, not anything like an actual moderate.</comment>

<comment>President Hillary Clinton? Only in a Tooth Fairy world.</comment>
