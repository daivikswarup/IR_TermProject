<comment>What a complete and total dunce.  It's too bad that the legislature failed to muster the vote necessary to oust LePage or even to put him on trial.  Now it will be up to the state attorney general to determine if he is violating the state constitution by his actions.</comment>

<comment>Just look at that face! He and Trump must have come out of the same mold. LePage is a nasty individual but he is the right party as many of them are nasty individuals. Republicans talk about President Obama overstepping his authority but they themselves feel they can do whatever the like whenever they like. Who cares if it maybe illegal or unconstitutional we are Republicans we rule!!</comment>

<comment>Being a Republican means that you never have to say you're sorry.  All of that "personal responsibility" they keep blathering on and on about only applies to poor people, minorities, and women -- not to their precious selves.</comment>

<comment>Quite right. Personal responsibility and also fiscal responsibility is another one of their favorite terms. I don't think they even know what that means seeing as they didn't count the pennies when it came to the Iraq war and beyond. No amount of money was too great for that who cares how we paid for it only it was never paid for!</comment>

<comment>Maine: The way life should be - except for their racist, incompetent governor!</comment>

<comment>Been to Maine multiple times. Can't recommend it enough. This guy is terrible for the reputation of the state and its citizens.</comment>

<comment>I live here. Trust me when I say you are 100% right!</comment>

<comment>Such fun.  Bundy and LePage stories on the same day.Reminds me, though.  I haven't heard from my crazy, racist uncle since Thanksgiving.</comment>

<comment>You're Trump's nephew?</comment>

<comment>He hasn't sent you an email? Call a paramedic! He might be dead!!!</comment>

<comment>Yet black people love LePage.  He'll be YOOJ!He should build a wall.</comment>

<comment>Yes, Motoboto, in his mind he is!</comment>

<comment>Maine, you've got some 'splainin' to do for electing a douchenozzle like LePage.  Same goes for New Jersey and Christie, not to mention Texas and Cruz.WTF, people????</comment>

<comment>Maine doesn't have a runoff system for governor so in a threeway race you can get elected even of you have significantly less than 50% of the vote which is what happened with LePage.</comment>

<comment>So what percentage of Maine voters picked the nutcase - Twice?</comment>

<comment>A little less than 40% the first time and a little more than that the second.</comment>

<comment>Maine is such a beautiful state.Why are the residents so f@&$ed up?Lot of inbreeding?</comment>

<comment>Same as any rural state.  People losing jobs as mills close, watching their kids move away or go on welfare, looking to blame somebody and have someone tell them what they want to hear.  That's what Republicans do.</comment>

<comment>Be careful, Velvet. I am a Maine citizen and maybe personally F@&$ed up, but not politically! LePage is a Mess!</comment>

<comment>Best comment of all. Thank you.</comment>

<comment>Christie had a record of success in office and did a decent job as governor at first.  LePage...</comment>

<comment>LePage got 48% of the vote in a 3-way race in 2014, as incumbent.In 2010, he won in a 3-way race with 38% of the vote.(Let's enact ranked-choice voting ballot reforms, people.)</comment>

<comment>So right. Democracy is desperately in need of that reform!</comment>

<comment>And there are still many who support him? From Maine...don't get it!</comment>

<comment>The many that support him are probably taxpayers, and wise enough to connect cause and effect.</comment>

<comment>What the Atlantic doesn't say is that the original nominee, William Beardsley, has long been suspected of covering for a child sex abuser during his time as President of Husson University in Bangor.  Beardsley is also a vocal critic of transgender rights in schools.  The withdrawal of his nomination is LePage's way of making an end run around the confirmation process to spare his buddy the embarrassment that would likely ensue, while still placing him in charge of the Department of Education.  LePage has little intention of actually performing the duties of the Commissioner of Education.</comment>

<comment>LePage is crazy like a fox.</comment>

<comment>Mr. LePage looks like he's one tantrum away from a stroke. He and Mr. Trump are twin sons from different mothers. Maybe the two of them are fit to lead private companies but neither is fit to govern states or nations. They are too impulsive and emotional to lead effectively and are loaded with massive amounts of unexplained and unwarranted anger. Simply unbalanced, like so much of the right.</comment>

<comment>"Shifty" LePage...about as nutty, valuable and desirable as a Christmas Fruitcake.</comment>

<comment>Yet another time when Indiana's Governor gets to say "See, I'm not the worst Governor in America"</comment>

<comment>Michigan's Snyder has 'em both licked.  He's the only one who poisoned an entire city.</comment>

<comment>"He's the only one who poisoned an entire city."So far at least.</comment>

<comment>Check out the story of Ferriday, Louisiana, or the whole saga of "Chemical Valley" there along the Mississippi. Jindal and his predecessors make Snyder and what he did to Flint look like pikers.</comment>

<comment>Well... there goes any chance I would be able to feel happiness this weekend.</comment>

<comment>Well, he's been so effective as governor...</comment>

<comment>Thanks, Republican Mainers.....if you hadn't elected idiot LePage, Arizona Repubs woulda brought him down here, and we already got enough *assholes in office.*Google "Evan Mecham" for a taste of Arizona's GOP gubernatorial excellence.</comment>

<comment>If he is to actually appoint nimself wouldn't that require confirmation hearings? He was elected gov. not el supremo</comment>

<comment>It's too bad Maine isn't more prominent. He's basically what Trump would be like if the latter meant what he said. Then I wouldn't feel sorry for all those primary voters being duped. </comment>

<comment>This is the problem with conservatism. When they win, they end up with people like George W Bush, Bobby Jindhal, Governer Brownback in Kansas, and assorted other nut cases, ideologues  or incompetents actually running things into the ground.Bring on Cruz, or Trump. Lets make another mutton pie.</comment>

<comment>Trump/LePage 2016The Dickhead Ticket.</comment>

<comment>Mr. LePage is a taint on American politics...and I mean that in EVERY sense of the word. http://www.urbandictionary.com...</comment>

<comment>Always strange for me to hear drug dealing singled out as the crime most deserving of execution- i.e,  more heinous than forcible rape, crippling assault, serial murder, poisoning water supplies...The outcry is typically accompanied by a call for taking away due process of law and protections against search and seizure."...black drug dealers..." oh yeah, governor LePage. A notable elaboration on your previous remarks. Just so we're clear on that. </comment>

<comment>Is there anything that braindead, crybaby, sissy libbies DON'T pout about?</comment>

<comment>I so enjoy being a sissy libbie.  I hope you have a wonderfully happy and productive day, good sir.  :)</comment>

<comment>Ich bin der Education FÃ¼hrer!</comment>

<comment>LePage is not just a bad politician. He's a terrible symbol to how the Republican Party has moved more and more away from actual libertarian principles and instead embraced right-wing authoritarian thinking. Ike and Lincoln are long dead, as are their ideas. Time now for 'Duck Dynasty Conservatism'. Sickening.</comment>

<comment>LePage is a racist.  So what?  It's time we try little bit racist policies since everything else failed.</comment>

<comment>LePage served the taxpayer well with his clamp down on welfare fraud. Say thanks.</comment>
