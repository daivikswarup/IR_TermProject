<comment>The author is correct that racial appeals are used in politics although he studiously omits an mention of the use of this tactic on the left, which is every bit as guilty as the right.  The most obvious current example on the left is Black Lives Matter - useful idiots for the Democrats who they are counting on to keep minorities and white elites fired up in an attempt to replicate the voter turnout Obama enjoyed for Hilary next year (good luck, by the way).</comment>

<comment>Interesting comment that black lives matter is a political ploy rather than a reaction to discriminatory policies in the criminal just system. Do you suggest that such discrimination doesn't exist?</comment>

<comment>I half-agree.I don't think BLM is a ploy. The protests are far too spontaneous in origin for that. But I do think Hillary might have some trouble keeping the Obama coalition together. She might be able to do it, but it's far from certain at this point that she will.The Democrats are freaking lucky that the GOP has gone off the rails and is imploding, given their own decline in political competence.</comment>

<comment>I'm reasonably sure she will gain the vast majority of the support of the aspects of the coalition. The bigger question is whether she can drive turnout the way that Obama did.Of course, this is probably why she's hugging so tightly to him - she's running on his record, and will probably try and use him as a campaign surrogate as much as she possibly can.</comment>

<comment> I'm reasonably sure she will gain the vast majority of the support of the aspects of the coalition. The bigger question is whether she can drive turnout the way that Obama did. Oh, she will. She'll run on the "lesser of two evils" logic. Especially if Trump wins the nomination. People will vote for her just to keep Trump out of the White House.</comment>

<comment>Trump has no chance in hell of winning the nomination, especially after kowtowing to the Establishment on wages, so it doesn't really matter. But until the recent debate when he shot himself in the foot, I'd actually say that he (along with a  Kasich/Rubio ticket with different demographics) would have been the ones that were the exceptions to the rule and could have posed a threat with a lot of average Americans. Hillary already has the most anti-Trump groups in the bag as a fait accompli.Another Bush or any other Establishment ticket, on the other hand, would have definitely been the lesser of two evils logic for the white working class.</comment>

<comment>Hillary already has the most anti-  GOP groups in the bag as a fait accompli. Like I said, all she has do is stand there and go "It's either me or them in the White House. Which is it?" Big city and minority voters it's a no brainier.</comment>

<comment>Depends on who we are talking about.If someone like Rubio is nominated, the up for grabs vote will be the middle class and big business, and the swing states will be the same as always-OH, VA, FL, etc. The former is increasingly divided by regional and racial lines, which works in favor of the Democrats for the President, the Republicans in Congress and on lower levels. The latter will back who they think will win-they backed Bush II and Obama alternately. But it all won't matter if the white working class pulls a 2012 2.0 and stays home, which basically gave Obama victory. It'll be the same here even with less turnout. And that's what I think will happen.Trump is somewhat different. He had the potential to begin winning working class black votes given his drug legalization and tax stances, but he ended any chance of that with the last debate. Trump can get the white working class, which while declining is still the single largest voting bloc in the nation, out in force. However, any attempts to nominate Trump will lead to civil war-the establishment has already proved that they are stupid enough to back Bush unquestioningly even while it became clear that the infighting was damaging the GOP, so I won't think they'd wake up there.So, unless Hillary is indicted by the FBI and/or the GOP suddenly wakes up and becomes competent, she will win. And that's what I think will happen.</comment>

<comment>Rubio wont win the nomination. Hillary isn't getting indicted. As I'm not really sure what any of this has to do with my argument about how Hillary will use and exploit the "lesser of two evils" concept to her advantage. It's pretty much what she's counting on. Especially with liberals, minorities, and blue/swing state voters.</comment>

<comment>I dunna.  Trump and Carson are in the process of flaming out, and Rubio is 3rd in the polls.</comment>

<comment>Trump and Carson are still riding high in the polls with them getting a percentage point in the polls every day as every time someone declares Trump to be "done," he keeps climbing higher. At this point, its really hard to call.I can see the GOP establishment falling back on Rubio to win over crucial FL after the fall of Bush, but the GOP base and the extremists don't seem to like him.</comment>

<comment>I didn't get Trump's appeal- since he's constantly insulting my people- but I was watching a speech of his the other day, and I kind of get it now.  He was calling every other candidate on their BS and naming naming.  People like that.  Even I liked that.  It was entertaining as hell, and nice that someone with a huge platform was calling these people out. Watching the debate the other day on economics, I kept hoping they'd pivot to asking Trump something, because, while he's kind of full of it, at least he has SOME knowledge of the economy, unlike the rest of them.  Plus he's less of a bummer than the other candidates, who are doom and gloom all the time.Again, he's a terrible person that I would never vote for, but I wouldn't be surprised if he got the nomination.</comment>

<comment>Trump is a celebrity scam artist of a salesman who truly doesn't believe what he says and flip-flops all of the time, but will say whatever to gain attention and win votes. As you can tell from all of the hordes of commenters between this site and others across the web, it seems to be working. Otherwise somewhat smart people have bought into his bulls hit hook line and sinker.However, such a guy should not be at the levers of power making policy, but behind a camera on a set where he belongs.</comment>

<comment>Oh absolutely.  I'm just saying I can see why people enjoy his antics.</comment>

<comment>Your perspective becomes a little more nuanced when you have potential Trump voters in your family. The fact that he's financially independent of the Adelsons or Norquists, and therefore is in a sense incorruptible... I can't emphasize enough how important that is. And let's face it: he does have a sense of humor and he's unscripted. Not at all like the GOP Establishment, or Hillary Clinton for that matter. Trump is indeed the crazy (but refreshingly honest in a way) uncle who you've had beers with, if you are like me-just add the hair, the helicopters, and the trophy wife in. Perhaps that's part of why I tend to differ from many people here on Trump and the people who support him. It's can't really be reduced to the caricature that does indeed come close when it comes to other "joke" candidates like Santorum.He won't. And I'm saying this as a guy who thought that until the last debate, he stood a decent chance against Clinton if he made some unlikely but not impossible moves. He's not willing to do what is necessary to outfox the Establishment, but the Establishment is determined to kill him. He'll die. He's not going to die in the next few months, contrary to what both the Washington Post and Karl Rove says. He will impact the race. But he won't win the nomination, unless he does something unpredictable.</comment>

<comment>Are you sure the establishment has the power to stop him?  I'm not so sure anymore.</comment>

<comment>For now, yes. Not least because of Trump himself. That answer to the wage question might prove to be his downfall in the long run.Anything can happen in 2016, so you never know, but my guess is it's going to be 2012 all over again with the base sitting on their hands when the GOP Establishment brings out the plutocrat of the year.</comment>

<comment>Carson will be in single digits by New Years.  Cruz ticks off all the Carson boxes and has the advantage of not sounding like wholly uninformed on foreign policy, which will be the lead issue through the holidays.</comment>

<comment>This is true, which why I think that Carson will partner up and be someone's running mate.</comment>

<comment>Who do you think will win the nomination then? Bush has been damaged beyond repair by Trump, from what it looks like.The point of the matter is that the math favors Hillary, but it's not a sure bet. And the biggest way the Democrats can help the GOP is to act like it is.</comment>

<comment>Too hard to call and say at this point TBH. I don't think it'll be Rubio. As much as he's become the GOP establishment's Plan B after Bush failed, the base and the extremists don't seem to like him too much.That said, I'm not ready to write off Trump yet either. He's still hugely popular as I can see him winning over a few of the red and swing states for the nomination. It will be real close.I can also see him and Carson partnering up. I can see it now: "Trump/Carson 16. For racial unity." Yes, I'm being half snarky and cynical and half serious.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, anything can happen. Kasich/Rubio is a ticket that I think would have the best (translation=decent, but not great) chance against Hillary. I lived in OH for a while during the Recession.  Kasich came in with a *nightmare* situation in 2011 and did pretty damn well-so if he's running for President, he has Ohio in the GOP column for sure. If Rubio can haul in Florida, that means we have a race. But I'm increasingly pessimistic on that happening. Kasich just doesn't have a very photogenic personality and doesn't excite either the base or the Norquists. Rubio is VP material in my opinion-he's young, he's fresh, and that part of why he's not going to last in a battle against Hillary politically. I don't think any GOP candidate since Reagan has had the same kind of political skill as the Clintons do.I've become increasingly convinced that the K-street boys would rather scuttle the ship than see that happen. Hillary's acceptable enough for the majority of Wall Street anyway, and the Roves clearly aren't going to accept anything other than Jeb Bush. They don't care about winning anymore, they just care about short term corporate profit, if 2012 didn't make that clear enough.I don't see it. Carson is too much of a social conservative (and too focused) on gay marriage and the related issues for Trump for one thing, and the two ideologically conflict elsewhere, especially on foreign policy and tax plans. More importantly, Carson isn't durable in the same way Trump is, especially financially-I don't think Carson will be around in the spring of 2016, unlike Trump. If Trump wants to have a serious shot at the nomination, he doesn't want to hook up with another outsider-he's already got that base cornered. The Donald is a lot of things, but he's not completely politically incompetent and would probably realize that.</comment>

<comment>Kasich is this cycle's RINO who will be subsequently thrown under the bus and out, and he knows it  as he's sounding and looking like a mix of weary resignation and frustration at this prospect.Carson's social conservatism is precisely why he's doing so well. Remember, the base and the fringe are outraged that the liberal "SJW" are "ruining" America by letting Gays marry and Caitlyn Jenner win awards, so he's pandering to them and getting easy money and votes by playing the culture war.And Trump hooking up with an outsider with be a stroke of genius I think. The outsider duo and team. And like I mentioned, Trump and Carson will add a racial element to it. Like I said "Racial unity" as it'll also deflect accusations of Trump being a racist (not that it'll help).</comment>

<comment>Which sucks, because Huntsman could have beaten Obama in 2012. Kasich has the chance that Huntsman lacked (Ohio>Utah), but his personality is running into problems.That's a misconception that's I've noticed is endemic among Democrats. A lot of the GOP base does not cares about anymore, at least to the extent that it would decide an election-and the GOP Establishment is making themselves even more unpopular by pretending that this is the case. Trump has accepted the gay marriage ruling, and it hasn't dented his popularity at all. Immigration and anti-free trade is what is getting Trump his support, not abortion.Not politically-it'll just weaken his chances of nomination while not brining in enough support to make it worth it. Carson is fundamentally a short term issue. I'm not sure if Trump is smart enough to realize that, but if he makes it far enough to consider running mates, it won't matter. If Trump wants to pick up working class blacks, he's better off flip-flopping on the wage issue rather than picking up Carson. And Trump is probably fully aware that he'll be called a racist anyway-that was a fait accompli from day #1 of his candidacy, solidified after the Ramos incident.</comment>

<comment>A misconception backed by the numbers:http://publicreligion.org/site...https://www.washingtonpost.com...http://www.people-press.org/20...http://www.pewforum.org/2015/0...When you have 53% of people, 80% of that Republicans who think that things have gotten  worse  since the 1950s, there is a problem.And Trump is probably fully aware that he'll be called a racist anyway-that was a fait accompli from day #1 of his candidacy, solidified after the Ramos incident. Except that Trump denies and doesn't consider himself racist and has repeatedly claimed that blacks and latinos like him. Picking up Carson will just confirm that "See! I'm no racist! I picked my black rival as my running mate!"</comment>

<comment>But it has gotten worse in a lot of ways, especially if you belong to the largely white working class base. Pessimistic feelings on where the nation is going, even culturally, often involved a far wider range of issues than gay marriage. In general, the widespread feelings of pessimism on the course of the nation isn't something that can be manufactured independent of reality. Moreover, being opposed to gay marriage doesn't preclude the possibility of voting for someone who isn't, if they appeal to you for issues that you perceive as more important. That's critical for Trump.What luck for politicians that they can say things in public that don't correspond to what they actually think.</comment>

<comment>They mean as far as getting worse as social issues as well and its those pessimistic feelings is why they're jumping on board the Carson and Trump bandwagon especially as far as the "Make America great again" meme that both of them are exploiting to the fullest.</comment>

<comment>Potential Trump voters are motivated by a lot more than that. Economically(which helps fuel anti-illegal immigrant and anti-free trade sentiment), in terms of American power in foreign policy, the dysfunction political system and Republican Party, discontent with cosmopolitanism and Beltway elites, it's a whole potpurri of discontent. Carson shares some, but not all of these, and is more motivated by Santorum-esque issues-which is part of why he'll ultimately flame out.And yes-perceived cultural decline is a very important factor here. But gay marriage and abortion is far from the driving factor.</comment>

<comment>Let's just agree to disagree then.</comment>

<comment>Fair enough.</comment>

<comment>For white males, *haven't* things gotten worse since 1950? In 1950, America was the only industrialized nation left intact, black people could be told to get lost, and women weren't much higher than that, either. You could support a whole family on a GED with a house, two cars, etc.Compared to then? *Hasn't* life gotten a lot harder? Sure, we have Google and the internet, but come on now...those who think life has gotten worse since the 50s...sort of have a point.</comment>

<comment>You're talking about economics. The poll and my point is more social issues.</comment>

<comment>For white people, especially in social issues! As I said, back in the 50s,  everyone white could tell black people to just go away, and Uncle Sam would be like "sure thing". Women weren't thought of highly, either, though I'm not sure how many of them were flat out told to their face that "lulz you can't do this because you're a woman". Given how few women pursue careers in tech/finance/etc. (relatively) even today, I'm not quite sure what the exact nature of discrimination against women was in the 50s, though I do know that there was explicit segregation along racial lines.And yes, it was obviously terrible for minorities, but for the straight, white, male that's the acceptable target of all sorts of "look at me, I'm so progressive" stances and jokes, the economics got a hell of a lot worse, and a lot of people have made great strides in making Mr. Whitey not so high and mighty anymore.So, for this one particular group of people, the stereotypical straight, white male, I'm not sure things *have* gotten better. What are the lines you're thinking along?</comment>

<comment>In today's Zimbabwe, every black racist Marxist can tell white people to go away. In fact, whites in that country can't own any farmland at all.</comment>

<comment>You mean like the way Sanders has repeatedly claimed that Cuban Americans support Obama's appeasement of the apartheid Castro dictatorship in Cuba and that Cuban Americans support Sanders?</comment>

<comment>I'd prefer Kasich as well, but he's run a crap campaign and he came off like an unhinged grumpy uncle in the debates instead of the only grownup governor who could actually run a country.</comment>

<comment>My thoughts exactly.</comment>

<comment>yes, Hillary will have support of the various dem coalitions, but the question is will she get the turnout--in states like Ohio and Florida, that will be key.</comment>

<comment>Amongst the big city liberals, minorities, and independent voters turned off by the GOP, sure. It's the rest of the state she should be worried about.</comment>

<comment>you have no EVIDENCE that they are 'spontaneous'</comment>

<comment>The Democrats ran a racist ad of their own in 1988 in California-connecting a Hispanic man who murdered his wife with Bush Senior. Remember, back in 1988, Hispanics didn't carry the same demographic or media oomph.So I'm not really sympathetic to Susan Estridge trying make the campaign about race in December of 1988 as posthumous revenge for losing 5 out of 6 before Clinton.</comment>

<comment>Just to point outBLM has done WAY more attacking the Left's presidential candidates and disrupting their events.So your conspiracy theory there seems a little tin-foil hat esque</comment>

<comment>Right - let's see how vocal they are against Hilary once she is selected as the Democratic nominee.  My guess is they will turn their attentions exclusively to the the GOP at that point, not to mention after they start collecting Dem donor money to fund their operations.  They won't bite the hand that feeds them.</comment>

<comment>I think you are confusing a movement with an organization? Take "Anonymous" for example - they are not a group - they is no hierarchy, no leader, no unifying ethos or platform or spokesperson. It is just a bunch of people, some working alone some working with others, for various goals. The same is true for BLM, Occupy, w/e other movement you want. There is no leader who is going to 'direct' them...</comment>

<comment>"Black Lives Matter" are "useful idiots."You did not even need to be baited to show your prejudices.</comment>

And he's promising to make us more like the whitest region in the world, Scandinavia.And look at his constituency! The whitest crowds you've ever seen! He's a very talented politician.</comment>

<comment>Sanders was involved in the Civil Rights Movement from its earliest days.  It is one of the reasons he became serious about politics.  (Same for many of us, incidentally).  We knew which side we were on, even as kids.Sanders is not well known among the minority communities either, but his history is clearly in support of the working class in all its hues.</comment>

<comment>"He was down 7 points to Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis in August of 1988."That's not true, or at least not in the way that this author is trying to imply. Bush Senior did not owe his victory to Lee Atwater-he owed it to Ronald Reagan more than anything. By the time of the GOP convention, the lead of Dukakis was already nearly gone, and anyone mildly political cognizant was aware that it was going to keep fading. Bush Senior was a lot more harmed by Iran Contra than Reagan personally and wasn't very visible in the primaries, whereas Dukakis had the advantage of beating Jesse Jackson. But by the summer of 1988, the dynamics were changing fast.  This was before Horton or the Revolving Door.http://www.pollster.com/blogs/...Bush Senior would have won in 1988, Atwater or no Atwater. It might not have been 41 states without Atwater, but he would have decisively beaten Dukakis. The economy was booming, it was clear to all that the US was on the winning side of the Cold War, and while Reagan was not the demigod he's since been portrayed as by the GOP at the time, neither was he unpopular in the slightest as per the liberal countermyth: he was leaving office with over a 60 percent approval rating, the only President to do so other than Bill Clinton. He had brought the USA back its confidence after two decades of problems, and many people saw Bush as another four years of Reagan. He was going to win, and it was obvious by the late summer that he would. And that's part of why I dislike what happened with Horton so much-it was so unnecessary.I also take issue with the idea that anti-busing attitudes were purely racist-for one thing, busing was heavily unpopular among working class blacks as well. For another thing, working and middle class whites had plenty of legitimate reasons to dislike busing, not the least because the most ardent proponents of it (and the first to cry racism) were more affluent whites and "inside the Beltway" types who made sure to send their kids to private schools or out of the district to make sure they couldn't be bused. The reason the GOP didn't do well in the 1970 midterms was more related to the economy, the stalemate in Vietnam, and Nixon's general personality issues than compared to the likes of Muskie and EMK rather than race. The USA in 1970 was still a New Dealist country in many ways, and the general consensus of Democrats for the economy, Republicans for order and foreign policy would hold until at least Reagan, and in some ways (electoral dynamics), Clinton.</comment>

<comment>It worked for Obama in 2008. Talk of 'clinging to guns and religion' worked well for him. Race-baiting working class whites was his chosen strategy.</comment>

<comment>This doesn't make a lick of sense. Anyway, working class whites would've been against him, or any Dem, from the start. They've been like that ever since LBJ passed the Civil Rights Act.</comment>

<comment>No. Bill Clinton showed how a democrat can get working class white votes in the Midwest and upper South. Obama openly rejected Clinton's agenda of including working class whites.</comment>

<comment>You know, despite solidly winning over all of the entire Rust Belt area in 2008 that just so happens to be largely populated by working class whites...</comment>

<comment>No, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, etc. are wealthier and dominated by middle class whites. Working class whites are most pivotal in the lower Midwest and South. Minnesota and Missouri are parallel universes despite being only a few hours apart by car. Obama didn't even try for whites in places like Missouri, so no wonder he lost so badly there. I don't think he knew how. If he and Bill had had better relations, he might have learned how.</comment>

<comment>Your contention that Obama ignored working class whites is false. You act as though the white working class is some good 'ol boy monolith. They are not. He ignored working class whites for whom issues of religion (ie gay rights and abortion), guns, and "states rights" were of the utmost importance. Which meant he punted on the south, Missouri, and the Great Plains.But he did reach out to white working class members who were concerned with labor rights, jobs (in manufacturing), healthcare, and support for spending on infrastructure construction and maintenance. He didn't deliver on all these promises, but they were appealing to white working class voters and helped him win states like Ohio.</comment>

<comment>So, you'll no doubt reject the utterly shameless use of the "Hispanic vote" and other such race-baiting.</comment>

<comment>Minnesota's electoral votes were in no danger of going to the R Party, so there was really no reason for Obama to spend a lot of time in MN. Since I saw him here, I think he went above and beyond what was absolutely necessary to achieve his goal.</comment>

<comment>Under Obama whites have become the new black.</comment>

<comment>Do utterly lack self-control. You are excused from the table. Now go out in the yard and play with the other swine.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, they sure had his back. That must be how the Gingrich Revolution never happened.How did Al Gore and John Kerry do with that bloc? Please, by all means, hang onto your belief that Obama somehow spurned or betrayed the white working class. As if they would've even given him the benefit of the doubt anyway.</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure how much it worked for him. This comment also spurred the Birther movement, which actually started in the Pennsylvania Democrat party.</comment>

<comment>It got millions of hispanico, black, and Asian voters to come out for him who would not have voted otherwise. Obama wanted to show that he didn't need white people to win and he succeeded. That republicans are now trying to flip Obama by showing they don't need brown and black people to win should come as no surprise. </comment>

<comment>more baloney.</comment>

<comment>So, you're arguing that Obama DID NOT get millions of new voters to vote for him?</comment>

<comment>Oh? Gee, most Republicans say it was Hillary. The more important point being, the D's abandoned the idea very early on. It was the Know-Nothing wing of the R Party that is still chewing at it, even now.</comment>

<comment>What's the Democrat party?</comment>

<comment>Your argument is that Obama ran on a big FU to working class whites, in order to sucker in a coalition of industrialists, Wall Streeters, Hollywood and other elite whites and all darker-skinned others who were united in their animosity?That wins some kind of dumbass prize. </comment>

<comment>A very subtle FU, too. His use of a very subtle dog-whistle politics isolating working class whites, while offering policies that might geuninely help them, was masterful.</comment>

<comment>1. You do not understand the meaning of "race baiting." At best, you are unintentionally using the term backwards.2. Since there are no facts to support your accusations, backwards or forwards, your beliefs must be based upon prejudice. So I will say it clearly - you are a racist.</comment>

<comment>Race-baiting is using race to achieve social, political, or economic goals. Race can't be used in a way that is not "baiting." You can't use the concept of race "backwards." Race was created because it served to allow the creation and manipulation of a labor force in colonial and early national America. Race isn't real. It doesn't actually exist. It's a social construction. If race isn't useful to someone somehow it quickly ceases to exist.</comment>

<comment>You are correct that race is social construction. Race does not have any scientific meaning and the very use of the term "race" to characterize a group is racism.However, race baiting is not just any use of the topic of race to influence an election. Historically "race baiting" has denoted appeals to racist prejudices, especially fears.  For example, the Willie Horton campaign used by George H.W. Bush appealed to white's fears that black males wantonly rape white women. Much earlier, Southern politicians appealed to fears of a slave revolution.Nazi appeals to German anti-Semitism were described as "race baiting" because the Nazis believed that Jews are a separate "race."In recent years, racists have attempt to invert the meaning of "race-baiting" by accusing victims of who complain of racism of "playing the race card." If you have followed the surge of racism in America following Obama's election, you know that accusations of "playing the race card" are often, perhaps most often, hurled by racists.So, when people accuse Obama or Black Lives Matter of "race baiting," they are using the term backwards. Neither Obama nor BLM is pandering to racist prejudices - they are complaining about them. That is not "using" race; it is opposing the use of "race."</comment>

<comment>If no one ever attempted to 'bait' anyone with race, race itself as a meaningful social concept would just fade away into irrelevance. The very invention of race was an exercise in 'baiting.' Race has served many interests in many ways. It's use is not limited to those who are 'for' black people and 'against' racial discrimination.</comment>

<comment>I agree that the notion of race has been abused in many ways.However, the concept of "race" did not originate as a political weapon. There were bona fide historians, philosophers and later scientists who sincerely believed that "race" was a useful way to categorize people.In the early 20th century, "race" was academically defined by geographic location. Hence, for example, the "Caucasian race" included dark skinned Ethiopians. All mainstream attempts at a scientific definition of race were abandoned after the Nazi's attempt to describe all of human society in racist terms.Today, the term "race" is used either (a) by racists who believe there are races, (b) unavoidably by media and others to describe events and situations involving racism, (c) very loosely [and imprudently] to broadly distinguish between amorphous groups inaccurately delineated by skin complexion, ethnicity, language, origin or whatever the person using the term is thinking about at that time.</comment>

<comment>If race isn't "abused" is ceases to exist. Race began in 17th century British America as a way for a budding planter class to structure colonial society to its advantage. Scientific racism was a later  iteration that came in the mid-19th century. I'd recommend Many Thousands Gone by Ira Berlin and a Book entitled Scientific Racism whose author escapes me at the moment.</comment>

<comment>Race-baiting has been around forever. Obama was elected and re-elected. Herman Cain could have been, if not for fallacious allegations.</comment>

<comment>And gone with Cain's candidacy were your hopes for that ambassadorship to Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan.  So sad.</comment>

<comment>and 9-9-9!</comment>

<comment>Some of the policy points the author describes as racist are only incidentally if at all to do with race.  For example, the level of immigration that the USA or any other country can absorb is heavily dependent on employment rates, natural resources per person, rate of economic growth, and so on.  In a country with falling real wages and many involuntary part time workers, opposition to immigration is usual and natural.On the other hand, the 1975 NYC default on subway workers' pensions was clearly aimed at hitting primarily Negro workers,  and would have cost a number of workers five years pay or more.  There was no demand by the white liberal political class that the burden be spread more evenly, or that the white creditors or workers in other areas (who were more white) should share the pain so that those who lost were out no more than a years pay.The reality is that both parties are sometimes decent, sometimes not in this area.</comment>

<comment>Parties in general work to increase the power of the party, so if they can help a target group and thereby increase their power, they'll do it.As far as I know, there is very little altruism in politics, which is why increasing minority voters and minority voting is essential to increasing minority benefits.And the pushback by the people already receiving benefits is to suppress minority voting by suppressing minority voter registration.</comment>

<comment>Additionally, if the author is whining about immigration, that's an economic issue.Migration? That's a homeland security issue.</comment>

<comment>"flyers began appearing around South Carolina that blatantly accused, or implicitly suggested, that McCain’s adopted daughter from Bangladesh was really “a Negro child” he fathered out of wedlock."So a guy seeking the nomination of the party of the religious right down in in the Bible belt might have a problem with an allegation of an out of wedlock child, but only because that child is black?  Whatever.  You guys need to give up on this identity politics crap and realize in 2015 most Americans aren't racists.Let me guess, if a Republican against same sex marriage outed as being gay himself the issue there would be racism too if that lover was black, right?  </comment>

<comment>If the racial aspect didn't matter, then why characterize the child as "Negro" rather than Bangladeshi (which is in South-Southeast Asia, and nowhere near Africa, in case you're unfamiliar). Why add that part, since "the out of wedlock" should be enough, right?</comment>

<comment>So are you saying that the fact that Willie Horton "a convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole, who raped a woman and stabbed her fiancé while on weekend furlough. " was an issue because he was black, not because he was "a convicted murderer sentenced to life without parole, who raped a woman and stabbed her fiancé while on weekend furlough?"Huh?</comment>

<comment>Neither John832 nor FireWraith were commenting on that part of the story.</comment>

<comment>That's because I generally stop reading stories on The Atlantic when I encounter the first mistruth, distortion, or unsubstantiated claim.  Which means I can't tell you the last time I read an article to the end.</comment>

<comment>You are sooooo pure.</comment>

<comment>How do you know the substantiation didn't come later, in what you haven't read?  How do you know that the mistruths you think you see here aren't actually truths correcting the mistruths you've accepted previously?You can't know if you avoid the whole case.Why are you here?</comment>

<comment>Because the time to substantiate a claim with evidence is when you make it, not four paragraphs later.  But you tell me, did they offer proof that it was the race baiting part of the rumor about McCain that mattered or did they use some other research into some related topic that wasn't actually the event they were using as an example?Mostly I'm here to point out mis-truths and flawed analysis.</comment>

<comment>And you and I were not engaged in conversation prior to this...anything else, Captain Obvious?</comment>

<comment>The difference being that my comment was relevant to the one to which I was replying but yours was not relevant to the one to which you were replying.</comment>

<comment>I'm suggesting that it was an aspect of it. After all, the image of Horton used in the infamous ad was deliberately adjusted to make him look darker skinned. Why do that if you're not interested in making that part of the argument?Lee Atwater and Karl Rove are/were a lot of things, but incompetently stupid wasn't one of them.</comment>

<comment>I don't know, maybe for the same reason some people mistake Sikhs for Arabs or Chinese people for Koreans.  People frequently misidentify other groups.</comment>

<comment>McCain was on the track of winning the nomination until South Carolina, until the child his wife rescued off the streets of Dhaka became his "black bastard" by a New York hooker, among other things. Karl Rove is perdition bound for that one. At least Willie Horton actually was a criminal in a period where crime was a serious issue.Unfortunately for the USA when the terrorists came a 'knocking, it turned out that McCain just didn't have it in him to respond with similar repugnant tactics, giving Bush-and with him, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Bremer-the White House.</comment>

<comment>It's like trying to fight back against the Donald.Rove is a kind of evil genius.</comment>

<comment>Karl Rove and Donald Trump loathe each other, actually. And for good reason, considering how Rove pretty much is the tool of the billionaire donor class. The GOP base *hates* Karl Rove-these aren't closet leftists here. Bashing Rove is far from unpopular with the base, and you can see the interesting conflicts on FOX this creates.No, he's not. Lee Atwater (who also didn't like Rove) was highly competent, say what you will. Rove on the other hand really is overrated. If Kerry wasn't such a pathetic candidate, Bush II would never have won reelection with Turd Blossom in command, Swift Boaters aside.</comment>

<comment>Election night 2012 should have disabused anyone of the idea that Rove is some super genius.  Smart maybe, but not THAT smart.</comment>

<comment>Watch "Bush's Brain".Rove learned dialectics and echo-chamber issue construction, he learned how to use elected office to promote party interests, and he learned to use false flag and whispering campaigns to destroy others' reputations.I regret calling it genius.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, he's good at a particular brand of awful campaigning, but it's apparently only effective in certain situations.</comment>

<comment>Dubya wrecked this country while Rove paved the path and defended him on both the left and right.I was alive and awake at the time.</comment>

<comment>Rove is a glorified, wealthy ward heeler on a massive scale. His job isn't to expound on policy, it's to get the guy elected, so one can't fairly judge him by policy parameters. With that being said, that Rove had an influence on policy is pretty disturbing considering how illiterate he was with it. Guys like Lee Atwater or James Carville were fully aware of what they were and what they weren't, in contrast, and left policy up to the boss and his people that were steeped in the field.But the point is, he's really overrated, with a strong tendency toward fantasy. Absolutely no way Atwater would have thought that he could coopt Mexicans without shifting socially and economically in policy, as he showed in his advice in 1989 when recognizing the threat of Bill Clinton earlier than anybody. Rove also was only possible with the fantasies of the 90s, Contract with America GOP-the dealings with Norquist that would get Dubya going show just how much changed permanently once Senior lost.Rove succeeded more due to Democrat miscues and a willingness to do anything, rather than any form of innate political skill. That Jeb Bush keeps him around-especially after the bizarre Election Night 2012 meltdown that would have ended the career of anybody who hadn't both greased the palms Rove had and had such a dysfunctional party structure-demonstrates literally everything that is wrong with the GOP Establishment, and why the base hates them. Not only that, look at the midterms records since. The man picks losers, every time, because he is one.Then again, when you look at the money he's made, maybe his true goals had always been different...</comment>

<comment>I definitely think McCain - especially McCain of the 2000 era - would have made a far better president than G.W. Bush.</comment>

<comment>Trillions might still be in our Treasury!War would have still been reflex ONE.</comment>

<comment>BO still has outspent Dubya</comment>

<comment>I agree.  I thought to say- how could anyone worse have got the nomination?, but then I remember VP picks Sarah Palin and Dan Quayle. It's terrifying to think that someday, someone may be worse than GWB.</comment>

<comment>Easy enough to envision - just look at the current primary.</comment>

<comment>That's an easy assertion to make =P</comment>

<comment>Still a disaster.Just a different type from Dubya</comment>

<comment>Possibly, and it's entirely an academic discussion. I think a lot of what "went wrong" under Bush-43 had more to do with some of the people he brought in - Cheney, Rumsfeld, and their neocon coterie. I'm not so sure that McCain would have given them the level of access/influence/control that they had under Bush-43, nor been bulldozed by them as easily, at least at first.  Or at least, I like to think so.</comment>

<comment>"...realize in 2015 most Americans aren't racists."Correct – only most Republicans are.</comment>

<comment>Cute from the Dems, party of the KKK.</comment>

<comment>https://calendar.google.com/ca...Note at the writing of this, the year is 2015, not 1865. I hope this helps.</comment>

<comment>Please link me the study that shows that.  Also note you are not an authoritative source on any topic other than un-substantiated partisan one-liners, so any reply of yours that doesn't link an actual study is just useless partisan hyperbole.</comment>

<comment>Double Whammy.</comment>

<comment>Especially when you have GOP candidates with mixed race children born in wedlock not being an issue at all. </comment>

<comment>So? Minorities hold the cards in combating this. They demonstrated that in 2008 and 2012. All they have to do is...show up at the polls.</comment>

<comment>You mean how like they "demonstrated that" in 2000 and 2004 when they overwhelmingly voted for the white guy too? (Al Gore 90% of the Black vote)Right then.</comment>

<comment>But was turnout higher amongst black Americans in 2008 and 2012 than it was in 2000 and 2004?  (I don't know the answer, but if so that would, I think, be the point to susan's claim that they have the solution.)</comment>

<comment>susan is parroting the White Supremacist troll argument that African Americans only voted for Obama because he's black. The fact that they overwhelmingly voted for Gore in nearly the same numbers 90% to 93% Obama in 2012, show that to be patently false and not even worth a discussion.</comment>

<comment>Good to know. I was making the point that minorities have more power than they think, so they should use it. Not sure why you would have a problem with that.</comment>

<comment>They want blacks to be victims.</comment>

<comment>Who?</comment>

<comment>I thought that's what you were trying to imply. My apologies. Too much trolling in here these days, you just never know.</comment>

<comment>No problem.</comment>

<comment>That is not at all in her comment.  And I took the time to look it up and it turns out she's right: black voter turnout was significantly higher in 2008 and 2012 than in 2000 and 2004.  Higher, in fact, than in any election going back to the 1960s.(Also interestingly, 2008 was the first election in which black voter turnout surpassed white voter turnout.)</comment>

<comment>Did you actually read my reply to you where I acknowledged that was higher in 2008 and 2012? Or did you actually see the numbers that the 3-5% difference from 2000 is hardly what one would call "significant" and thus my point? Or my responses to her below that I misinterpreted what she was trying to say and apologized?</comment>

<comment>You didn't acknowledge that in your reply to me.  You wrote: "The fact that they overwhelmingly voted for Gore in nearly the same numbers 90% to 93% Obama in 2012, show that to be patently false and not even worth a discussion."I'm not-- nor was susan-- referring to the percentage of black voters who voted for the Democratic candidate.  I'm talking about turnout-- i.e. showing up at the polls.  The difference between 2000 and 2012, to use the two extremes within the period we're discussing, was about 10 percentage points which means about 20% more eligible black voters making it to the polls.Or my responses to her below that I misinterpreted what she was trying to say and apologized?No, because I'm reading this in my notifications not on The Atlantic.  I'm glad you apologized, but that doesn't change that you still didn't, apparently, understand the figures being discussed since you referred back to "acknowledging" the 90/93% difference (which I never thought you didn't know nor was I using to argue a point).</comment>

<comment>You didn't acknowledge that in your reply to me.  That's funny, I originally said:  in nearly the same numbers 90% to 93% Obama in 2012, No, because I'm reading this in my notifications not on The Atlantic. I'm glad you apologized, but that doesn't change that you still didn't, apparently, understand the figures being discussed since you referred back to "acknowledging" the 90/93% difference (which I never thought you didn't know nor was I using to argue a point). So if you see and acknowledge that this was a mistake and misinterpretation on my part and that I actually agree with Susan's OP then, what are you still talking about and are trying to argue then?That you're just jumping in to be a bad faith, devil advocate of a pedant that really isn't arguing anything? Got it.</comment>

<comment>That's funny, I originally said:in nearly the same numbers 90% to 93% Obama in 2012,Um, yes, which I quoted . . . and explained why your "acknowledging" a fact that I never thought you disputed was irrelevant.  The original comment was not a reference to the percentage of black voters who voted for the Democratic candidate.  It was a reference to the number of black voters who voted, period.So if you see and acknowledge that this was a mistake and misinterpretation on my part and that I actually agree with Susan's OP then, what are you still talking about and are trying to argue then?I'm replying to your comments.  And are you sure you agree with susan's OP since you have, for the 4th time, cited the irrelevant comparison of Gore's and Obama's shares of the black vote?That you're just jumping in to be a bad faith, devil advocate of a pedant that really isn't arguing anything? If you're still confused, please look at the links I provided.  Maybe the charts will make it clearer.</comment>

<comment>Soooo, you are being a trollish pedant just arguing for the sake of arguing? Figures. You can keep going on with that, while I'll just ignore you going forward. Bye now.</comment>

<comment>Jesus.  You claimed to have told me something you didn't.  I'm the bad guy for pointing that out?</comment>

<comment>Don't fret.  Being on MaxMen's 'ignore list' just means you soundly defeated him in argument.</comment>

<comment>Obama is mixed-race (half-black and half-white). Meanwhile, look at the stereotypes that Cuban American US Senators (and fellow GOP presidential candidates) Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz are facing from the left-wing MSM. The left/MSM are claiming that they are "not Hispanic".</comment>

<comment>Bush got over 81% of the Cuban American vote in the 2000 and the 2004 elections. In both elections, Gore and Kerry only got 19% of the Cuban American vote in those respective elections. In Gore's case, it was the Clinton administration and the Democratic Party's response to the Elian Gonzalez crisis that got him such little support from the Cuban American community.</comment>

<comment>Republicans have been working hard to prevent minorities (along with students and seniors) from being able to vote.</comment>

<comment>Since when?</comment>

<comment>Reconstruction?</comment>

<comment>Proof? Democrats were the party of the KKK and Jim Crow?</comment>

<comment>"From now on, the Republicans are never going to get more than 10 to 20 percent of the Negro vote and they don't need any more than that...but Republicans would be shortsighted if they weakened enforcement of the Voting Rights Act. The more Negroes who register as Democrats in the South, the sooner the Negrophobe whites will quit the Democrats and become Republicans. That's where the votes are. Without that prodding from the blacks, the whites will backslide into their old comfortable arrangement with the local Democrats."Kevin Phillips, chief Nixon strategist, to the New York Times, May 17, 1970(http://www.nytimes.com/package...</comment>

<comment>LBJ has a nice comment using a certain slur about blacks as well.</comment>

<comment>This comment isn't about slurs. It is about a tightly defined strategy to use anti-Black animus to win over the votes of racist white southerners in order to swing the south from the Democratic to the Republican party. You asked when the GOP became the party of racist and I gave you your proof. Complete with citation.</comment>

<comment>And I gave you proof."Lyndon Baines Johnson 1963... "These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we've got to do something about this, we've got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference... I'll have them racial slur redacted voting Democratic for the next two hundred years"</comment>

<comment>You don't do well with chronology, do you?LBJ passing the Voting Rights Act led to the GOP abandoning blacks and turning towards racist white voters in the south as their political strategy. It plays out in all the electoral maps and Congressional elections since 1970. Your quote supports my position.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. Most segregationists joined the now-defunct American Independent Party. Anyway, as for which major party abandoned key voter constituencies, check out the Cuban American vote patterns, beginning in 1972. While Nixon remained committed to a free and democratic Cuba, McGovern was committed to a policy of appeasement towards the Stalinist apartheid Castro dictatorship in Cuba. In fact, this was when the Democratic Party was being taken over by the New Left movement, which supported Castro in Cuba, as part of the movement's neo-communist agenda. As a result, Democrats started abandoning Cuban Americans in favor of pro-Castro groups in the US.</comment>

<comment>The words of a Texan (who knew the rednecks very well) does not support your argument.A Texan who also won elective office over and over in a highly  segregated society knew the voters propensity.An absence of racist attitudes in LBJ is NOT being illustrated here, but more his understanding of the ELECTORATE'S racism and how it manifests itself at the ballot box..</comment>

<comment>Men born in 1908 to working class families in rural Texas used the word. Period. Dot. No matter how progressive they otherwise were. There just was no stigma to it, especially when talking to other politicians.Grow up, people.</comment>

<comment>Cite.</comment>

<comment>Wow. Haha even when the proof is there and yet the lib still denies it. You people are lost.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. But how about the fact that Cuban Americans have been voting for Republicans in large numbers since 1972? Why? Because McGovern, a New Left Democrat, had said that "We can win this election without winning a single Cuban vote". Since then, Cuban Americans have never voted more than 20-25% for Democrats.</comment>

<comment>Proof?  A basic education about American History?What's in a name?  Conservatives were conservative then too.  Liberals were, well, LIBERAL.Surely you don't think the Confederate version of "Democrat" was also "liberal"!!</comment>

<comment>Do we really need to give you the historical context breifing again?</comment>

<comment>Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Mike Turzai told a gathering of Republicans that their voter identification law would “allow Governor Romney to win the state of Pennsylvania.”After the election, former Florida GOP chairman Jim Greer told The Palm Beach Post that the explicit goal of the state’s voter-ID law was Democratic suppression. “The Republican Party, the strategists, the consultants, they firmly believe that early voting is bad for Republican Party candidates,” Greer told the Post. “It’s done for one reason and one reason only ... ‘We’ve got to cut down on early voting because early voting is not good for us,’” he said.</comment>

<comment>Oh no, now you have to show up on election day!</comment>

<comment>They never said that. Why don't you look at the voter intimidation case in Philadelphia back in 2008? </comment>

<comment>I'm of two minds with this. First, it's imperative that you have a photo ID in today's society, even for more than just voting. You have to show picture ID if you want to go to the doctor or get a library card, to name a few, so it's worth the effort to get.Second, I live in a state where there is only one day of voting. There is no "early voting" for days or even weeks beforehand except by absentee ballot. If there is any chance I can't get to the polls, I make the small effort to call, get my ballot, and drop it in the mail. If someone's polling place is too far, there's no reason they can't do the same.Instead of just screaming about how horrible Republicans are, find ways around them for goodness sake. If you actually care enough about your right to vote, then beat them at their own game!</comment>

<comment>Or stop requiring petty additional steps to vote "for goodness sake."Instead of blaming voters for not voting why not do what other countries do (and Oregon for that matter) and mail the ballot to the person's household? Or do automatic registration in combination with online voting?Simple, pragmatic steps could be made to drastically increase voter turnout but we're seeing deliberate attempts to prevent that in this country.</comment>

<comment>Birth certificates should automatically bestow the right of enfranchisement.  We all agree Americans have that basic right.Even the SCOTUS wouldn't overturn the basic Constitutional franchise right of a citizen of the voting age.That's why the technique has been modified to just make it as difficult as possible to have a minority vote without openly advocating suppression.</comment>

<comment>Agreed. The almost comical suppression of Black vote in Alabama is a good example of a straightforward subversion without anyone calling it what it is.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, except for the "almost comical."It's explicitly race-based voter suppression, white supremacists in Alabama suppressing the votes of black voters.</comment>

<comment>Gee just like how the Black Panthers were intimidating people and trying to get them to vote for Obama? Remember that? Oh wait you probably don't. Stop spewing nonsense garbage.</comment>

<comment>You want to talk about voter suppression? Look at Zimbabwe, where in certain parts of that country, whites cannot vote at all. They can't own any farmland at all. And that's because Zimbabwe is under the rule of a black supremacist Marxist dictatorship. Closer to home, we have the New Black Panther Party case, when member of the black supremacist hate group were caught intimidating white voters in Philadelphia on Election Day back in 2008. How about leftist Democrats' efforts to encourage voter fraud in Florida in order to compromise Cuban American votes?</comment>

<comment>Feel free to talk about Zimbabwe on another thread. We aren't Zimbabwe.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. But how about the intimidation of white voters by the black supremacist New Black Panther Party in Philadelphia back in 2008? Why don't you talk about that?</comment>

<comment>Because you're an embarrassment. You have one un-sourced claim, I have decades worth of on going voter suppression.</comment>

<comment>No you don't. There is no voter suppression. In fact, voter fraud is the only voter suppression going on, since it tries to compromise voter integrity.</comment>

<comment>Where's your sources?</comment>

<comment>You mean like this?: http://www.discoverthenetworks...And for specific cases: http://www.discoverthenetworks...</comment>

<comment>You're a dangerously misinformed individual. I desperately implore you to change your sources of news.</comment>

<comment>How am I a dangerously misinformed individual? That would be you. You love voter fraud and voter intimidation, like what the New Black Panther Party did in Philadelphia back in 2008.</comment>

<comment>You have a single example of propaganda straight from Fox News. Voter suppression is a real occurrence and shouldn't be mocked by people of such low information like yourself.</comment>

<comment>The examples of voter fraud don't come from Fox. Your imaginary example of alleged "voter suppression" comes straight from MSNBC. Voter fraud is all too real and shouldn't be mocked by people of such low information like yourself.</comment>

<comment>Here's the thing. You're example, assuming it to be true since nothing came of the allegations against the two men; is an example of two men at one polling station. The voter suppression that I'm referring to are premeditated cases of deliberate attempts to prevent the overall voting population, and minority voters specifically, from voting. These cases were carried out with intent and prevented untold numbers of voters from being able to vote. Your lone example is a pathetic counterpoint which does nothing to detract from the history of conservative efforts to prevent accurate voting results in this country and others. You're not intelligent enough to continue this conversation. You're not well read enough to know what I'm talking about. And lastly, you're foolish enough to believe the website you cited for your evidence is in anyway a credible source of news. In short you're a waste of my time.I feel you're dangerously misinformed and I once again implore you to seek out other sources of news more reputable than the one you provided earlier.</comment>

<comment>Typical leftist whining propaganda.</comment>

<comment>In what way are voter id laws onerous? Please enlighten me.</comment>

<comment>I have done so higher in the thread, but you might be simply making an rhetorical argument.Everybody knows about methods of suppression in use for many many years in some parts of this nation.</comment>

<comment>No you haven't. Unless I'm missing a comment, you have not provided an substantive argument about how voter id laws are onerous.</comment>

<comment>You know in most states you can get an absentee ballot exception for work.People like you who think that there's some conspiracy to stop minorities or people in general to vote in this country are always ignorant of state voter laws. Or they only reference 1 state that it's an issue in.</comment>

<comment>I think you would agree we should try to get 100% of eligible voters VOTING.RIGHT?  EVERYBODY SHOULD VOTE?</comment>

<comment>Ban stupid people from voting especially the morons who voted for Obama twice.</comment>

<comment>You would be disenfranchised yourself!</comment>

<comment>I didn't vote for the idiot.</comment>

<comment>You weren't on the ballot?</comment>

<comment>No I don't. And not because I don't think everyone should vote. It's because I realize not everyone is informed enough to make a good vote. Citizens who are apathetic or lazy about informing themselves of the issues shouldn't vote. This isn't to say I would want to restrict their ability to though. In fact I go out of my way to inform my friends of deadlines, yet the majority of people I inform still don't vote. And I'm not doing it because I work for the board of elections. I'm doing out of (in my mind) pure civic duty. I try to get them to care, but many don't seem to.IF we're talking an ideal world, I completely agree with you though.</comment>

<comment>There you go.  You don't want every eligible voter to vote.Enough said.</comment>

<comment>That is a gross oversimplification and mischaracterization of what I said.</comment>

<comment>I'll engage you for one comment and one comment only. Republicans win with the following conditions: low voter turnout, low minority turnout, high older, white turnout.That Republicans are actively increasing the difficulty of voting for the overall population and specific minority populations is nothing new. Early examples abound from the pre-Civil Rights era.You're supposed work around is neither well known nor at all justified in the first place. As I've already mentioned, there are clear steps to take if we wish to increase voter turnout which Republicans oppose.Know that I despise people like yourself who lie to themselves in rather self-evident ways to defend an overtly wrong position for political reasons. I wish you luck in pulling your head out of the sand.</comment>

<comment>Don't run! I know the truth is scary! I'm going to address the only relevant sentence from your comment."You're supposed work around is neither well known nor at all justified in the first place."An ignorant voter is a bad voter, if they're not willing to find out these things by taking maybe 10 minutes looking at their state board of elections website, then they're more than likely ignorant of the ballot itself.Second, are you saying that a work exception is not justified? Who's the one suppressing votes now? Are you saying the person who has to work their butts of and can't make it to the polls in time shouldn't be able to vote? Some people you know work long hours and aren't always able to take time out on a specific day to vote. Taking time out when you can to run by the election office or fill out an absentee ballot request online is much more convenient.</comment>

<comment>nice.  I hope he takes it to heart, if not for his own good, for the people he might influence.Lots of pent-up heated and angry passion over there.</comment>

<comment>Wrong. But Democrats do that with Cuban American voters by compromising their votes with other votes through the use of voter fraud. Leftist Democrats also encourage voter intimidation and refuse to tackle voter intimidation cases when whites are the victims.</comment>

<comment>Sources? And quit up voting yourself it's embarrassing.</comment>

<comment>Many leftist Democrats are pro-voter fraud.</comment>

<comment>In-person voter fraud is virtually non-existent.</comment>

<comment>Generally true, voter fraud when it happens is usually with absentee ballots. Usually a caregiver appropriates votes from incapacitated citizens. Or bulk fills in other's ballots.That said, there are glaring gaps in voter rolls, etc; that voter id laws help close. And most if not all states that have implemented id laws, getting an id is cost free and relatively easy, assuming you don't have the myriad of ids they do take. Some of the laxest allow everything from employee ids and student ids, to your driver's license or military/government id.</comment>

<comment>It's very existent. It happend twice under Obama. An illegal alien just got busted for voting twice and her response was that she was "confused" Yeah sure. How many more are there out there that weren't caught?</comment>

<comment>> It's very existent. It happend twice under Obama.Wow! 2 votes out of millions is so huge! I'd explain about significance, but seeing you have at most as many brain cells as many times that illegal alien voted, I won't. Also, are you going to tell me nobody on the Republican side cheated? And is your name Hillary? You sure do suck.</comment>

<comment>The difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Democrats steal elections and Reublicans atleast earn them. You have no brain cells in your empty stupid liberal skull. I said twice by both elections meaning in both elections illegals voted. You're beyond retarded.</comment>

<comment>> The difference between Republicans and Democrats is that Democrats steal elections and Reublicans atleast earn them.I bet a parrot like you gets paid in crackers instead of nickels.>  I said twice by both elections meaning in both elections illegals voted.In other words, you didn't comprehend what I said about significance.> You're beyond retarded.You're a hundred times stupider than I ever was (even as a baby), so I guess you're beyond the beyond the beyond ...</comment>

<comment>You're just a misguided little retard. Go huff some paint troll.</comment>

<comment>> You're just a misguided little retard.You're a hundred times stupider than I ever was. It's obvious it hasn't sunk in yet.> Go huff some paint troll.Is that what your mom did during one of her binges? And LOL, someone with the name "Hillary Sucks" calling people trolls. I'd tell you to b more self aware, but well, being aware of someone like you wouldn't be pretty at all.</comment>

<comment>Learn to spell,you're like a 5 year old mentally challenged kid who stutters way too much trying to pronounce a word and fails.</comment>

<comment>Voter fraud is all too real in this country. You can deny it all you want, but it's real.</comment>

<comment>In-person voter fraud is virtually non-existent.</comment>

<comment>No it is not. It is rampant: http://www.discoverthenetworks...</comment>

<comment>Nope. Virtually non-existent.</comment>

<comment>Keep denying the inconvenient facts, fool.</comment>

<comment>Not a problem. It's virtually non-existent.In-person voter fraud.In Washington State, we vote by mail. No need to get an ID out once you're registered. Easy-peasey solution that doesn't strip people of their right to vote.If the goal was to (a) increase voter turnout and (b) ensure integrity of the vote, states would have vote-by-mail.If the goal is to (a) depress voter turnout of undesireable communities, and (b) ensure that only preferred voters can vote, then increasing the demands for ID is the way to go.So far, conservatives are choosing methods to depress voter turnout in undesireable communities. I look at that.</comment>

<comment>You know why voting by mail is inconvenient? What if the mail gets lost or stolen on the way to the election commission? What if they mix up the mailed ballots? There are many ways a mailed ballot can go wrong. It invites voter fraud. And how come you don't have a problem with other countries having voter ID requirements? You need an ID to go into a convention or some other important place. You need an ID to travel.</comment>

<comment>There are an incredibly small number of ballots that go out that get misdelivered. So we have multiple campaigns to reach out to people saying "didn't get your ballot? Call the Secretary of State (toll-free) for a replacement."Lost or stolen ballots are treated the same way -- lost. Call the Sec'y of State to get a new one.I don't know what you mean by "mix up". Do you mean, send the wrong ballot out? Again, that is nearly impossible given the way the ballots are produced and matched prior to sending. But again, your ballot is marked as to your district/precinct, so it would be very easy to spot a problem. It is an extremely low-cost solution to several issues:* Not everyone can get out of work or other obligations on Election Day * Not everyone can wait around to vote* People take too long in the booth* Sometimes ballots are quite longI can take my vote-by-mail ballot, spread it out on my table, go through my Voter Guide pamphlet, research on the Internet, and make an informed vote on my own time schedule.It solves a lot of problems, ensures a valid voter registration database, and makes voting much less of an issue.</comment>

<comment>Don't need to. The number of cases in Washington State where there have been problems with vote-by-mail are vanishingly small.A few people tried to vote their dead spouse's ballot.</comment>

<comment>Other countries have voter ID. Why don't you criticize that?</comment>

<comment>Because it's irrelevant to the discussion.</comment>

<comment>Because you don't want to get caught in a double standard.</comment>

<comment>Maybe. Maybe it's this simple: we put into place vote-by-mail, and the vast majority of these invented issues go away.People have a ballot mailed to their homes.They get their ballots, vote, send them in, and it's all done snickity-snick.In Washington State, you can even go on line to verify that your ballot was received and then counted.All the Sturm und Drang goes away, the vote is secure and easy, and no one needs to worry about finding your ID just to cast a ballot.</comment>

<comment>Beat who at their game? There's no game here. Single day voting has been the norm in this country. And absentee ballots have been around for awhile. A lot of states now have pretty lax excuses for applying for an absentee ballot.</comment>

<comment>Do you know why it is TUESDAY?</comment>

<comment>Yes, I've heard the theories. It's moot at this point though. The date hasn't changed in at least decades. And many states allow work exceptions for absentee ballots.</comment>

<comment>Motor voter is a threat to Republicans, isn't it.Oregon has a nice system.  No rules to keep others out.There are good examples of states who want everyone who is eligible to vote.</comment>

<comment>No it's not and your insistent drone about Republicans is getting tiresome. You have some clear partisan bias.</comment>

<comment>Voter integrity is a threat to Democrats, isn't it?</comment>

<comment>I assume you're referring to voter id laws. But is that why minority, particularly black turnout, INCREASED in states that instituted voter id laws</comment>

<comment>You realize, of course, it increased because of the fight for survival.Voter ID laws are explicitly designed to suppress unwanted voters. They solve a problem that doesn't exist -- alleged in-person voter fraud -- by making it difficult for a class of people to vote.</comment>

<comment>Support your assertion. The dirty secret the fear mongers are afraid to admit to is that turnout has increased and it's actually easy to get or provide an id. Don't have driver's license? Guess what, you can use a government issued id. Don't have that? Some states allow student ids. Not that? Some even allow employee ids. Don't have that? State can provide a free voter id for you. Don't have any of that? Go vote with a provisional ballot and then prove identity within a few days after election day.Edit: with exception to the student and employee ids. Everything listed here is pretty consistent across the board for states with voter id laws.</comment>

<comment>Let me guess: you think voter suppression, Global Warming, and Obama's birth certificate do not exist.</comment>

<comment>First, stick to the topic of discussion, stances on the last two have no bearing on the validity of the stance of the first one. Second no.</comment>

<comment>Your rules are so pretentious.  Your adherence to decorum is just plain cute.</comment>

<comment>It's not rules or decorum. It's called logic. Whether I agree or disagree with the last two parts has no logical bearing on the validity of my statements regarding what we're talking about or the first listed stance. The sentence is nothing more than a straw man used to damage my credibility. The first illogical leap was thinking that because I don't think voter id laws are a form of voter suppression that I don't think it happens. The second was that because of the first, I must also believe these other crazy (or commonly held as) stances. Implying that the first stance is as crazy as the others.All you've provided at this point is snark, and your last comment was proof of that.</comment>

<comment>The irony is that people trying to get in to democratic conventions have,to show ID.  Woooo.</comment>

<comment>Thats some seriously fascist debate tactics you're using there.</comment>

<comment>Let me guess: you think voter fraud, radical elements within the refugee crisis and the ISIS threat do not exist.</comment>

<comment>What if they authorized EBT cards as a form of ID?</comment>

<comment>And opposition to voter ID laws come from those who want to ensure voter fraud and keep rigging elections.</comment>

<comment>Nonsense. Opposition to unnecessary voter ID requirements comes from ordinary people who think that enabling citizens to vote is important.</comment>

<comment>Voter ID is just one form of vote suppression.Narrowing the window for casting ballots by having fewer days, manipulating absentee rules, purging the rolls, moving the precincts, allocating fewer voting machines, slowing the voting process in selected precincts, not allowing the use of BATHROOMS while standing in line without losing your place...There is much depraved creativity that has kept a population voting effect at bay for GENERATIONS.</comment>

<comment>Voter ID means that right people vote. Let me guess,you want illegals to vote? And Criminals too huh? Typical leftist dickhole.</comment>

<comment>Voter ID is just One form of suppression.</comment>

<comment>You are a borken record record record record record....</comment>

<comment>Are you mad at me?  Do you acknowledge voter suppression at all?I'm getting a hate vibe off your posts.</comment>

<comment>I acknowledge that there are probably people who engage in it. But voter id laws are not a viable medium for such practices anymore and the reality of the laws doesn't bare out the fear.</comment>

<comment>Contrast Texas, Alabama and a few Southern States' voting laws with those of Minnesota, Oregon, Washington California.There are models that remove much of the opportunity for suppression.The South does not have those systems in place.  They have systems that are designed for "voting control."You may offer the "why".</comment>

<comment>Please share these "voter controls."</comment>

<comment>As a personal favor to you?You don't seem to be receiving new information at this time.</comment>

<comment>No if you want to support your arguments. Vague claims are weak.</comment>

<comment>Explain why instances of voter fraud are so high in New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois and other left-leaning states?</comment>

<comment>No it isn't. Answer my other questions. Without voter id do you want criminals and illegals to vote too?</comment>

<comment>Yes, every American of legal age should be able to vote.  It is the whole spirit of our form of government.You too can lose the fear and hate, but you need to try and understand what it is to be a citizen of a democratic Constitutional Republic.We are strong because we include.Fear leads to violence.</comment>

<comment>See you're lost then. Wanting criminals and ILLEGAL aliens to vote. Illegals have no rights they aren't citizens. </comment>

<comment>Think about it.  Somebody will need to tell YOU if you're eligible.*There are some felons with your same name.*There are some illegals with your name.*Sorry, you can't vote because you can't prove you are special enough.</comment>

<comment>Which is why there needs to be voter ID laws,it prevents non eligible people from voting.</comment>

<comment>Voter fraud is one example of voter intimidation.</comment>

<comment>Is that why Mexico has a higher turnout and mandates IDs for all citizens to vote? And their id law is more stringent than most states. It's a specific id with your biometric data on it.</comment>

<comment>Mexico's politics are such that a voter may risk their job, their family or their life when they vote.I think the topic becomes overly complex when you bring in the suppression/racism/manipulation of voters in MEXICO.</comment>
