<comment>Okay then, I will take a random guess and say it will be 'poptarts' that kill me.</comment>

<comment>I can think of worse ways.  :-D</comment>

<comment>Depends on the flavor.</comment>

<comment>When my middle brother was sent away to school when I was 17 and our younger brother was 14, we looked at each other and said, "Now we get THREE Poptarts per box!"  Life was good back then, when one more poptart made a difference in my day.</comment>

<comment>You mean Katy Perry and Britney Spears?</comment>

<comment>Excellent! Well done. That makes it a 2-for-1, then.</comment>

<comment>Great article!  Interesting.  Thank you.I think what this points out is more than anything else, is that no matter how much we try to avoid it, we all die in the end:VegansOrganic eatersGym exercisersLong-distance runnersEaters of the Mediterranean dietAtkins Diet followersHerb usersVegetable eatersSalad eatersEaters of the Israel Diet8 hour sleepersKickboxersWeight liftersPlastic surgery addictsWater purification system snobsFish diet proponentsHealth food store frequent shoppersYoga addictsYoga while-sweating-it-up addictsEtcetera, will all end in death.</comment>

<comment>none of it matters! burn it to the ground! wooo! nihilism!you forgot, however, that those of us who drag ourselves to the gym daily and do our best to eat healthy and avoid common vices will most likely not die in a hospital bed drowning in our own fluids from CHF or be amputated one limb at a time due to unmanaged diabetes.</comment>

<comment>LOL!  Well, the truth is that from the way some people talk, they're *almost* convinced they've found the secret to immortality.   :)And btw, that whole list up there, WILL die amputated, and drowning in our own fluids.  Death is what it is - death.  And as much as it's ugly to talk about, our bodies are already dying.  We're over the peak.Death either comes by a piano falling on your head, or it comes pretty gradually.Hey, unless one plans death (as some people are doing nowadays).Maybe some in that list above could give us a year longer?  Maybe not?</comment>

<comment>Hemingway and Thompson had the right idea. when the party gets boring, call it a night</comment>

<comment>I wonder how many of us would sell our soul to live eternally?   :)  Betcha a lot!!!!</comment>

<comment>Here's hoping you and your little dog get bored soon.</comment>

<comment>Oooooh snap!</comment>

<comment>Historically literate Mich?  Ever hear of the Stoics?  Nowadays! Snirt! Chuckle!</comment>

<comment>Whether Chuck Norris ultimately dies in the end remains unproven.</comment>

<comment>Maintaining a healthy lifestyle is about enjoying life more while living not just postponing death.</comment>

<comment>But the trick is living a high quality life in strength and mobility and independence as long as possible, and choices you make for diet and exercise affect that.</comment>

<comment>You are obviously right, but there's something to be said for how you get there. A few months ago we moved my Grandma to assisted living, and there are some sad souls there who are still living, but treated their bodies like playgrounds while they were younger. The ones that took care of themselves are admittedly still old and at the end, but not in constant physical misery.</comment>

<comment>Problem is, that there is no "pretty death."  Death is ugly.  The prettiest death (I think) is to have a piano fall on one's head and be instantly gone.  The alternative (something lengthier) is not nice.I volunteered for a while at a very nice nursing home locally, where a lot of the people there were not necessarily the hard-drinking, hard-living type, and yet all of them were a hot mess because they were at the end of life.  Mind you, these were active people who played tennis, who had had amazing careers, had been runners, and so on.  People who had taken care of themselves.  Heck, some had all their teeth still, they took such good care of themselves!However, some had dementia and it was awful.  Some had heart disease simply because the heart and circulatory system will still wear out and develop plaque no matter how well behaved you are.  Some had cancer.  All kinds of stuff.  The end of life is just not something ideal.  It never is.  If there were a button I could buy that would make the end of life nice, I would!!!  I WISH!!!What I have decided is that I'd better do right by my family, by my friends, and hope that there is a hereafter and a Creator that will give us a really good eternity for all the trouble we go through here.That said, I have seen on TV some meth addicts that look 90 at 19.  Scary.</comment>

<comment>What's the difference between a hot mess and a mess?  I wonder if anyone who uses that phrase knows the answer to that.</comment>

<comment>A "hot mess" is a wonderful phrase which means, "an extraordinary mess," "a superlative mess," "a mess which knows no bounds."</comment>

<comment>And here I thought it was another one of those things that one person on the Internet said and everyone else copied.</comment>

<comment>"another one of those things that one person on the Internet said and everyone else copied."That's exactly the way all human languages and dialects develop.  Someone says something, someone else repeats it, and so on.  That's the reason why in 2016 we no longer speak the way the pilgrims spoke.  Language is never static.</comment>

<comment>That's also how stupid expressions like "hot mess" proliferate.</comment>

<comment>(shrug)  Hey, there are a lot of expressions I hate too.   :)</comment>

<comment>I don't use trendy expressions.  I prefer to know what I'm talking about because I formulate my own thoughts and words.  But it's just so much easier to babble "hot mess" or "wrong on so many levels" and hope no one asks you what you mean.  Isn't it?</comment>

<comment>So let's see, I'm assuming that when you were a teen, you didn't use the words in vogue during your teenage years then?  I certainly did.</comment>

<comment>"So" no, and "so" I don't use them now.  "So" you still do.</comment>

<comment>No language remains static, so there.  What's your occupation?  Certainly not English teacher or professor.  They're not as wound up as you are.</comment>

<comment>Not every dipdonkey piece of jargon is an improvement on the language, and a widdle stamped foot right back at you, little girl.  Fail at changing the subject and "so" I don't care anyway about attempted insults from some little girl who thinks "so" is a cerebral thing to say.</comment>

<comment>So you're the arbiter of what is "dipdonkey" (whatever the hell that is) lol</comment>

<comment>"So" more jargon, and this time, the little girl sheep follows another ignorant trend:  omit punctuation."So" adios, Sarita.  "So" I don't fight poorly armed opponents.</comment>

<comment>Alas, whatever is the reason you hate me, you've given up the campaign!  Glad to hear it.  Ciao.</comment>

<comment>Rather live well thebone life I am sure of.  Butbif you want ab"fun" read, try STIFF by Mary Roach.</comment>

<comment>I read somewhere that Stiff was a really good book.  Thanks for the recommendation.  I'll be sure to get it!</comment>

<comment>Who's telling the better stories and still smiling as they remember? That counts too.</comment>

<comment>You forgot Donald Trump Lovers.</comment>

<comment>the constant whining of the progressive and SJW lot will most likely lead to a berry aneurysm bursting in my brain one of these days</comment>

<comment>Whine, whine, whine.</comment>

<comment> Millenials own whining about the littlest things and seem to lose sight of real dangers that we need to be vigilant on. Being proactive is a good thing. </comment>

<comment>Smoke more weed. Calms you right down.</comment>

<comment>counting down the days to retirement when i can partake again. unfortunately, as a medical professional, my employer kind of frowns on such wonderful indulgences</comment>

<comment>You're not supposed to tell the boss...</comment>

<comment>random UA's tell the boss, not I</comment>

<comment>They can kinda tell these days. Unless you do something hardcore, like bath salts. Which is why people do that shit.</comment>

<comment>That's the thing about Death. Normally, one cannot plan when it will take place unless they commit suicide. More often then not, it is the unexpected accident or health crisis that does it. Sometimes I read death notices in the paper and am sometimes floored by the age disparities. One guy will be 92. Some lady will be 77. Then you read some guy who was 52. Last, you see some Woman who was born in 1987 who passed away from cervical or prostate cancer. I think a lot of it has to do with genetics. One guy smoke cigarettes for 60 years and dies in his late 80's. Another guy smokes less than the first guy did for 20 years and dies at 42. Or the alcoholics who started drinking daily in their late teens and die of liver failure in their late 20's and early 30's.</comment>

<comment>A woman who passed away from prostate cancer?</comment>

<comment>Rare, but I have seen it first hand. I knew a lady who died at the age of 37 from it.</comment>

<comment>You do know women don't have a prostate gland, right?</comment>

<comment>Your incorrect.http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/...</comment>

<comment>Next to the G spot.</comment>

<comment>"Even so, the lesson is clear: Lives are defined by the little risks we take, not the big ones. "Well, my take takeaway on the simulation is at some point some pretty horrible deaths start to overwhelm not so horrible deaths.  I mean some cancers can be very painful as your organs fail, or Alzheimer's is not fun at all when you have no clue who you are anymore.So maybe at some point a reevaluation is necessary - if you ever wanted to become say a professional skydiver, old age is as good a time to start as any.  Even if early Alzheimer's kicks in and you forget to pack your parachute, you are still better off than what is coming a short time later.</comment>

<comment>The simulator is flawed in that it considers Hispanic a "race" when in actuality it is an ethnicity.  I am white and Hispanic.</comment>

<comment>Not really, it's more a culture. You can be many ethnicities as Hispanic or Latino, everything from Spanish, to Caribbean, to Central/South American</comment>

<comment>Somebody tell La Raza.</comment>

<comment>LittleWillie's tips for a long and healthy life:Try to laugh at yourself, make love when you're able, and when you wake up in the morning thank God you woke up in the morning (whether you believe in God or not). And have a donut. (LittleWillie likes a glazed old fashioned. He enjoys first nibbling at the glazed sugary ridge around the donut's perimeter.)You'll do fine.</comment>

<comment>Well, that's a good plan for people who don't have heart disease. Sex and donuts kill!</comment>

<comment>If you're in a public place and someone yells, "Allahu Akbar!" it might be best to take cover.  It would also be good if you are armed.</comment>

<comment>Clickbait much?</comment>

<comment>Though it will be with a whimper, I resolve to have a smile.</comment>

<comment>Holy shit... According to this graph black men are almost twice as likely to live to 100 than us white guys... Kinda flies in the face of every other thing I hear about race and public health, with all due respect to the socioeconomic disadvantages that play into those storylines of course.</comment>

<comment>But heres the trick.You will die anyway.But who bleeds you to death,and drains the living out of living?Who?</comment>

<comment>The take-away from this article is that I should write to my Congress-person and demand government action against lightning.</comment>

<comment>I ran the simulation for black males, and I don't see anything about being gunned down by racist cops.  Why's that?   Isn't it the leading cause of death?</comment>

<comment>It's amazing how disease trumps every other category by far. Even for the black male simulation I ran, there were more than 30 deaths to disease for every death to suicide/homicide (and suicides are about twice as common as homicides so the disease:homicide ratio is more like 100:1). I'm sure for other races and genders the disparity would be even greater.Yet we spend so much energy and money worrying about violent causes of death, like terrorism, police brutality, and gun crime. We would save so many more lives if we directed the energy we spend in those areas to health research and improvement instead.</comment>

<comment>This is why the ammosexuals' paranoia would be so laughable if it wasn't hurting others.  They're so worried about the potential boogieman at the door late at night, they end up killing themselves when the drop the gun they thought would save them</comment>

<comment>Someone I know who is 22, a marathon runner, works out at the gym, watches what she eats (salads, fish, green juices, etc.) is in the hospital with her third blood clot in the leg within 1 year.  She's already had two surgeries and is headed for her third.  She has to be on blood thinners for a long time.  She also had an infection in an eye that has left her blind.  The other eye is good so far.  (No doctor can identify what has caused any of this, though runners kinda tend to get blood clots more than other people, though that wasn't a diagnosis, just a guess from a doctor).Goes to show you, you can take care of yourself like crazy, but we're all on death row anyway, and sometimes we even get close to it when we're young.I figure that as long as you don't weigh 500 lbs., you get some exercise (doesn't have to be aerobics or nuthin'), you lift some weights (hey, it can be the vacuum cleaner or some box you're moving in the attic), as long as you don't take heavy drugs, you don't drink too much, you don't smoke, you get some sleep, and you don't mainline candy and desserts, you'll be about as okay as anybody who does lots of working out, and watches everything he eats, and so on.</comment>
