<comment>Kind of funny that you single out Rubio for lying given Trump's position center stage. Politicians and lying, generally speaking, is no surprise. One could say the same about people. For an in depth look at lying and politics "The Virtues of Mendacity" by Martin Jay is a great read.</comment>

<comment>None of the GOP candidates give a rat's ass about our national security. All of them are a disgrace to this country -- pea brain chicken hawks  shamelessly demagoguing and beating their chests.  The only one I saw up there making any sense at all regarding foreign policy and domestic security was Rand Paul -- even though I do not agree with him about  anything else.</comment>

<comment>I must agree, war Hawks seem to ignore the fact that wars do not always turn out as promised, especially our last few wars.  It seems so easy when they promise, but politicians promises are often empty.  Remember going to Mars? How is that going?</comment>

<comment>Poor Republicans heads must be spinning. They want government to keep them perfectly safe, and they don't trust government. What to do?</comment>

<comment>bingo. It is akin to their love of police and their hatred of police unions</comment>

<comment>Simple, change whoever is in charge of the Government from that black dude to someone like them. Then they'll love it again.</comment>

<comment>White Hillary?  OMG.  Hell no.</comment>

<comment>Why should they trust this government, which has proven itself to be untrustworthy and pro-Islamic?</comment>

<comment>The curtain does seem to be finally lifting to reveal one very hard truth: we have a very difficult choice to make between personal freedom and personal security. We would all like to have both, but in this real world it may be that this is no longer possible.</comment>

<comment>So, when your right to own a weapon is, in reality or perception, threatened, your seeming first instinct is to prepare for war to fight against those you see as a threat to your rights.  Do you think others are less willing to fight back against the government or those in power when their rights are attacked?  Terrorism isn't much other than a-symetric warfare.  So your "muzzie" rhetoric fuels terrorism and kills Americans.  Good job traitor.</comment>

<comment>That may not be enough. We may find that we need to start deporting people like - oh, say, YOU - to special detention camps in order to assure that the ever-shrinking remaining population is safe enough.</comment>

<comment>What are you smoking? Have we made any choices between spending and taxes? Nope, we won't be making any choices here either.</comment>

<comment>Personal security cannot be guaranteed by the government, much less perfect security, period.We are faced with a difficult choice: How much liberty are we willing to give up for what practical increase in security? Followed by, at what point have we given up so much security that it's abuses and unintended consequences outweigh its benefits? I don't know how one makes these decisions without knowing what information is being collected, and whose.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but on the other hand, being deprived of one's life due to a security failure is a pretty basic denial of personal liberty.It is a hard, difficult situation, without completely satisfactory answers. We have to make some hard choices.</comment>

<comment>"Hard choices" in this context means we're going to spy on you. Not that hard really.</comment>

<comment>It is obscene that presidential candidates might not be allowed to talk about the basic nature of bills before Congress in a presidential debate. The voters are supposed to be the accountability mechanism for the Senators voting on those bills and ultimately, those bills themselves. Classified information should cover things like specific military operations and intelligence, not the possible powers granted to the federal government in a bill before Congress.The powers granted to government MUST be open for discussion and debate, otherwise we don't live in a democratic republic at all!</comment>

<comment>Oh, you're just noticing we're no longer a democratic republic?</comment>

<comment>If in doubt, assume surveillance powers are being abused - Because if they are not, it would be a historic first.  It's just contrary to human nature not to abuse unchecked power.</comment>

<comment>And the corollary, if in doubt, assume more surveillance powers will solve "the problem" (any "problem" â€“ acid reflux, irritable bowel, cover-your-arse syndrome).FBI investigated the Boston marathon bombers and gave them a pass.</comment>

<comment>You've got to feel sorry for the government agent assigned to monitor the iritable bowel surveillance feed.</comment>

<comment>Well, given that under Obama there has been aimless, pointless, surveillance aimed at grandmas and grandpas but not at the likes of Farook, I think just about anything else would be a definite improvement.</comment>

<comment>these bozos are promising to keep us "safe"?</comment>

<comment>Oh you skeptics.  I'm sure all these guys are great at posing for pictures with a fire fighter standing on the rubble or giving speeches in front of a "Mission Accomplished" banner.</comment>

<comment>I'm a little offended.  I'd like to believe you think even my opinions that you disagree with are nuanced and well thought out.  "Hobby Lobby supports ISIS" isn't the kind of thing I'd post even if there's reason to make a broad connection between the two.</comment>

<comment>Yes.  I disagree with you on that too.  Manipulating people through their employer sponsored insurance is a load of $hit.</comment>

<comment>Awww, John.  I don't maneuver you.  You walk into it.  The folks on the right spend a great deal of their energy criticizing women for being single parents or for having abortions, but any opportunity to prevent it is met with self-created roadblocks.  "Your ability to prevent pregnancy through cheap, easily accessible contraceptives interferes with my religious beliefs as does your ability to have access to abortion."  They're really telling women that sex is a privilege they can't afford.  It's hypocrisy.  You may like the idea of personal responsibility.  I do too.  Then, there is life -- where getting people to be responsible requires support and encouragement.</comment>

<comment>Discouraging women from having sex.  Is this the mountain you're willing to die upon?  ;-)</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>It is what they're doing.  They disagree with women having self determination when it comes to sex and procreation because their god wants women subservient.  It's the kind of thing people keep complaining about when it comes to Islam.  You may believe it is a legitimately held belief but it has subjugation of women at its heart.</comment>

<comment>That's what all the old conservatives say when they think no one is listening.  Getting women to want to cooperate is so much better. :-)</comment>

<comment>I don't disagree.  It's harder when everyone's needs must be taken into account.   It's still worth doing. That's why I argue with you.  You already know it despite the nostalgia.My mom grew up in the days of "barefoot and pregnant", and it didn't work out.  She was on the program until the program failed.  Feminine.  Strong.  Smart.  Made $hit happen when it needed to happen.  No reason to expect her to be ready to do so, but she was.  We're just more honest about it now.Subservient vs Someone you can count on.   What's better?ETA:  My dad.  He didn't leave us.  He became disabled. Also:  Sorry for taking a serious turn.  I know you're just playing. Forgive me.</comment>

<comment>You're an interesting guy.My mom went to work in a warehouse.  She was a member of the Teamsters.  She did her hair and makeup each day before she went to work.  She was a pretty, petite blond that didn't look like she belonged in such a place.  She excelled.  She ended up a line supervisor.Traditional gender roles aren't going away.  Most of us live largely within them still.  It's just a bit more flexible now.  Men and women have more choices.  Generally, that's a good thing.</comment>

<comment>1.  Yes, that is how I asked the question.    Am I right?  You can tell it is a question from the question mark.  You recognized it as a question because you answered it.  You said "yes."2.  I did not make my account private because you suggested it.  I did that because you started stalking my comments in a most rude and inappropriate fashion.You are an ugly human being and a liar.</comment>

<comment>For what it is worth, I read this exchange, and your other exchange with her, and I agree with Anita.  You are a liar and a poor excuse for a human being.You are blessed that Terri tries to see through your faults.  I'd spit on you if you were in the same room I am.</comment>

<comment>He's not so bad once you get to know him.</comment>

<comment>I do not want to know him.  I already had to set my profile to private because he is stalking me, and he is dishonest.  If you got to look at my posts before he forced me to set it to private, you know this.</comment>

<comment>There are much scarier people than Jett that post here.  He's not scary.</comment>

<comment>He's not scary.  He's pathetic.Please, darling, you seem like a glass of chilled champagne in this sea of tepid Pepsi.  Don't buy into his theory that he is not that bad because others are worse.We should expect more from human beings.</comment>

<comment>You're cute.  I like you.  Chill.</comment>

<comment>Yes, I understand now.  I will be more careful and more skeptical going forward.  There are so many ways for people to cultivate their little insanities.  Trying to think the best of people is a good strategy for living in the real world, but this forum, obviously, is not a real world.  It is built on deception and personal vanity.  Doubt I will spend much time here.See you in the funny papers.</comment>

<comment>Ted Cruz is a Tea Party nut. Lets not forget that America. Who believes anything the Tea Party says after 5 years of lies and radicalism. Every family I know in Texas knows this guys has done zero for working Texans. He just used the Senate as a staging platform for his megalomaniac ambitions and sociopathic grandstanding. The guy doesnt care about people or security or anything beyond the crazy things he was brainwashed into believing by a Cuban Daddy who abandoned him.</comment>

<comment>I never thought that Ted Cruz would do something like this â€¦something actually good for the American people.</comment>

<comment>I have a friend and colleague who worked for NSA before changing careers, and he has said that remembering which details were classified and which weren't was a frequent issue for him. How much of the story had CNN reported? What about this or that number? It led to a lot of nodding his head and saying, "Ummhmm" when people were talking about international affrairs. His story gave me some empathy for elected officials with access to these kinds of info - keeping straight what you may and may not say is harder than we might think.</comment>
