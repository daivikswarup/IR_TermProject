<comment>The problem is that without these requirements, racial and gender disparities get worse.The better argument is to make more detailed guidelines instead of judges doing favors for whites, parents, women, and other groups they think deserve less harsh punishment.If we want to make this good, they could make more nuanced requirements for everyone instead of applying nuance when they feel for the perpetrator which due to human nature will be biased.</comment>

<comment>I think a standard prompt that reminds judges of the various biases to which they are subject could help a lot with these issues. Moreso than the average person, judges are aware of issues of bias and trained to combat them. A brief reminder that they shouldn't go light on white-collar offenders or reach for a longer sentence when the defendant is from the hood could probably ameliorate a lot of these issues. A good review process to identify and redress patterns of discriminatory sentencing would also be nice.</comment>

<comment>Hey Blue Fish,Yeah, I think the idea of a prompt could be helpful. I've been very impressed with the integrity of the federal judges I've known, and they really do try to get it right. But I think we also need to live with the vicissitudes of the human system that we have. We will never find the ideal judge; one person's ideal judge is another person's tyrant. (Coughenour is a great example: he agonized over the Ressam sentence in a way that I, as a relatively defense-minded person, found admirable. But political conservatives and the US government were VERY angry about his sentencing decision in that case).</comment>

<comment>The problem with the prompt reminding judges of biases is that it reinforces said biases.  "If everyone is biased then I'm not a bad person."  What's better is to provide judges with an average and standard deviation.</comment>

<comment>Hey MattThanks for the comment. The interesting thing about the Sentencing Reform Act is that racial disparity actually got WORSE (gender disparity is a moving target that's had little correlation with federal sentencing policy). There are all sorts of theories about why this is, but in the end, I think it comes down to charging decisions. That is, it comes down to prosecutors cutting whites, parents, women, etc. breaks. The difference is that, when a judge wanted to cut someone a break, they couldn't under the Guidelines. And they still can't under mandatory minimums.What's most fascinating to me is that you SHOULD be right. You'd think that the more detailed the guidelines are, the more equity there would be in sentencing. But it turns out that just the opposite is true. As the Guidelines became more detailed over the 90s and early 2000s, sentencing disparities increased in a correlated fashion.</comment>

<comment>So then maybe prosecutors should get less discretion about when to charge and what charges to bring if they are invalidating changes to sentencing by their bias.There should likely be more work upfront on charging guidelines for prosecutors and then hold them accountable for the racial / gender disparities of their offices.  This was a big point of contention in "The New Jim Crow".  Prosecutors do not even have to release information about who they charge for what until racial bias is proven (which cannot be proven without access to their data).  IT is a catch 22.This could also be drive by racial disparities in access to quality lawyers.</comment>

<comment>I mean, I totally agree with you. But I'm married to a public defender, so I may be a bit biased ;-)</comment>

<comment>I grew up around poor people in a minority majority area.I saw the effects that prosecutors in the drug war can cause to communities without the resources to fight the war being waged on them.It isn't pretty.Lets be clear, there isn't a war on drugs.  There is a war on poor drug users, mainly of color.</comment>

<comment>The poor never have the advantages of the rich.  That applies not only to law, but to health care, to safety, to nutrition, to education, and to everything.  That's also why everyone has always wanted to be rich.  That never changes.Being rich opens the doors to everything and provides free passes like crazy.</comment>

<comment>Spot ON!  Prosecutors get votes for "throwing the book at" anyone.  The fact that they plump up charges with a lot of bogus "extenuating circumstances" so they can get tough sentencing and be seen as "tough on crime" is a great reason not to allow them to set the agenda.</comment>

<comment>Federal prosecutors are not elected.  They don't get votes.</comment>

<comment>You can't take charging discretion from prosecutors, our entire criminal justice system depends upon prosecutorial discretion.  We basically must accept that people are flawed and expose their decisions to public scrutiny.</comment>

<comment>Hi gomer_rsThanks for the comment. Prosecutorial discretion is a huge topic that was too big to tackle in the piece. Candidly, I worry about how our criminal justice system relies on prosecutors somehow overcoming their desire to win cases in order to represent the broader public good (as they supposedly do). I'm a little skeptical of any system that relies on people acting in anything other than self-interest. But the same applies to judges: they are also not all-knowing or all-wise.I think you put your finger on Coughenour's objection to broad prosecutorial discretion, though, in your last sentence. The difference between a judge's decision and a prosecutor's decision is that a judge's decision is always made in public, where a prosecutor's decision is always made in private, and is never subject to public review.It's a balancing act, like everything in our justice system.</comment>

<comment>This is not entirely true.  We see the prosecutor's decision in the charging documents.  We also see it in the plea deals they strike and the positions they take at sentencing.  All of these things are a matter of public record, filed on the court's docket or stated in open court. Why do you think they are operating in secret or can't be scrutinized for their decisions?</comment>

<comment>I want to point out also that, since Booker, the sentencing judge has regained some of the power from prosecutors, for good or bad.  There is a downside to this.  The parties have a tougher time negotiating a plea deal when it is harder to predict what the actual sentence might be.  Sometimes the prosecutor and the defendant go into the sentencing hearing thinking they're looking at one sentence and come out realizing the district court judge had a whole nother idea.  The prosecutor and the defendant can only be sure of the minimum and maximum, which can sometimes be as much as 0 to 40 years!  That's a much bigger range than, say, a guidelines range of 235 to 267 months.</comment>

<comment>A very good point. And something that several judges and prosecutors brought up to me (interestingly, no defense attorneys ever mentioned Booker as a bad thing).The one thing I'd complicate in your answer is that part of the essence of plea deals is the practice of pleading to lesser included charges or pleading to fewer charges than appear in the indictment. So, even under the Guidelines, the range was greater than you suggest, because a standard practice was to dismiss or "plead down" many of those charges, rather than simply applying the Guidelines range for every charge. (I hope that's clear as explained...)Still, Booker was not the unalloyed boon that many defense attorneys make it out to be.</comment>

<comment>"Operating in secret" may overstate the point, although not by much. As you say, we can see the effects of prosecutorial discretion on the record (in choice of charging instruments and plea deals), but what you can't see are the reasons for those decisions.It's a black box. We can see what goes in (facts, complaint, police report) and what comes out (charges and, probably, a plea deal). But what happens in the box is a mystery.And, importantly, those decisions are never subject to review at any stage. Thanks again for your several astute comments.</comment>

<comment>Coughenour's argument, regarding judicial v. prosecutorial discretion, works because it doesn't require saints.  Any system that requires humans to act perfectly is doomed to failure.   Every systematic solution must create space for humans to fail.</comment>

<comment>And that is why there are huge problems with it.</comment>

<comment>The problem is the quality, ethics and values of the judge rendering a decision on a case.  Judge Coughenour, who is highlighted in this article seems very smart, and thoughtful, yet I've read newspaper articles of corrupt or idiotic judges doing the wrong thing and not giving out a proper sentence (examples: the judge in Texas who sentences a rich kid for killing or maiming several people probation for affluenza (this is the guy who fled to Mexico with him mom).  I read about another case several years ago about a judge in the Dakota's or Montana who blamed a 13 year old girl for being raped by her teacher (the judge said she enticed him) and let the teacher off with hardly any jail time).  Judges are either appointed or elected and not all are morally or legally qualified to hand down a rational, non-bigoted, and fair judgements like Judge Coughenour. Just look at the judicial bias on the US Supreme Court! There are no easy answers to this conundrum.</comment>

<comment>Hey, happyktThanks for the comment. I totally agree. What really gets me about this issue is just what you brought up: we'd love to have an all-knowing, all-wise arbiter. But that being doesn't exist in our court system. When Judge Coughenour told me that "you've got to trust the person making the decision," he wasn't speaking idly. That's an actual conundrum for all the reasons you laid out so nicely.I think it's a really key issue to our system of justice. Whom do we as a society trust to mete out punishment? How much "accountability" should that person have?</comment>

<comment>Yeah the article presupposed judges are not a combination of jaded, corrupt, and racist / otherwise biased..I'm not sure how well that presupposition actually applies.</comment>

<comment>This is true.</comment>

<comment>well said. One of the things that also influences judges, fairly or unfairly, is the cost to the criminal over and above the sentence.On the one hand, a $100 speeding ticket is nothing to a rich man, but devastating to a poor man, so he might be inclined to use jail on a rich repeat offender.On the other, a white collar criminal typically loses it all when busted and convicted- job, savings, family, house, etc. By the time sentencing rolls around around he may have suffered quite a bit. A gang member, however, may not have suffered anything and, in fact, could have his reputation in his business enhanced</comment>

<comment>I am glad you called it a business.  It is ruthless in its retribution. It has negatively effected the area where I was raised.  While sentencing is important; it is evaluates the effect, the consequence of drug crime. I hope I am not too far off topic. There is a connection between poverty , black markets, and sentencing or justice.  we could take the  "black" out of markets, then maybe the violence would lessen.  IMO,  the question is who would bear the cost from this arrangement- taking the profit out of these markets?  </comment>

<comment>The rape case caused such an outcry the perp got re-sentenced harsher.</comment>

<comment>This is the sort of person we need on the bench.  Judges make irreversible decisions about people's lives and must never lose their humility about what they are doing.</comment>

<comment>Here in red, backward Texas we let juries do the sentencing (unless it's a bench trial).  There are minimums and maximums for offenses, but those mins and maxes leave the jury a lot of wiggle room.  What makes jury sentencing better than judge sentencing is that there are many SCOTUS decisions guaranteeing a fair, impartial jury.  It makes no sense to essentially throw those guarantees away when the trial transitions from guilt/innocence to sentencing.  The SCOTUS hasn't issued anywhere near the number of opinions on judges to guarantee a fair sentencing.  Basically, let juries do sentencing in the federal system, get rid of the USSG, and then you'd have more equitable sentences.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the comment. I have come to agree with you.And yeah, state court is an entirely different beast for all sorts of reasons. I've done a lot of reporting in local courts in the Bronx, and I think the rules of the game are different for all sorts of reasons. For one thing, state courts are hugely idiosyncratic by jurisdiction in a way that federal courts are not. And, frankly, the quality of lawyering and judging is.... shall we say, more uneven.</comment>

<comment>I agree--state and local courts seem far more idiosyncratic than federal ones do--hundreds, thousands of jurisdictions make for some oddball decisions--they are not bound by these sentencing guidelines, so far as I know--are they bound by the Booker decision? I agree with the commenters who said this is a remarkable article--I've been subscribing to the Atlantic since 1974 and find this to be the kind of writing I've missed the last few years. Thanks!</comment>

<comment>Hey thanks for the compliment. That means a lot.To answer your question: no, Booker does not apply to state courts. There's one simple reason for this: the Sentencing Reform Act also didn't apply to state courts. A few states have guideline-like policies (indeed, the SRA was based on state initiatives), but they vary as much as anything does state-by-state.If you're interested in the nitty-gritty, here's a link to the National Center for State Courts booklet on guidelines. It's not worth reading in detail, but the overview is pretty good. http://www.ncsc.org/~/media/Mi...</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the link--here in St Louis, we just had a minor scandal over sentencing of the son of a politically connected man who got the county police chief and the county executive to write  letters to the judge testifying to the son's good character--made it seem like a quid pro quo--and the sentence given seemed lighter than those for others who'd committed a similar crime. http://www.stltoday.com/news/l...</comment>

<comment>Two points germane to this.  First, federal judges are almost universally better qualified and vetted than Texas (or any other, for that matter) state judges.  Second, I'm skeptical that Texas no longer has certain mandatory minimums that take the sentencing decision out of the jury's hands.  When did that change?  After all, it's the handcuffs placed on the decision makers that's really the problem in most systems - and the thing to address first.</comment>

<comment>Every crime in every jurisdiction has a mandatory minimum and a maximum.  There are certain crimes that only a judge can issue deferred adjudication on, but DA isn't jail/prison time.  That works out in a defendant's favor.And I wouldn't go making blanket statements about federal judges vs. state judges.  There are some scoundrels on state benches, but there are some hacks on federal benches as well.  And even if your statement were true, it makes relying on the jury to sentence that much more important.</comment>

<comment>Yeah, jurors are never racist.  That is why no one is voting for Trump.</comment>

<comment>Of course they are, and that's why we have many SCOTUS opinions addressing those harms.  What's worse, two racist jurors on a 12 person panel, or one racist judge who doesn't have to answer to anyone?</comment>

<comment>Exactly!</comment>

<comment>The principle of juries is highly democratic.  There was a time when the king ruled over everything, and determined the fate of anyone charged with anything (the gallows, or prison, or freedom).  The concept of juries provided fairness not present when monarchies, oligarchies, and so on were the ones which determined that fate.  Can juries be biased?  Sure they can, but the purpose of voir dire is to attempt to eliminate some of that.There will never be perfect trials.  Ever.</comment>

<comment>There is an irony in the recent Malheur bird refuge invasion. The irony comes from the fact that the two ranchers who were sent back to prison for arson on federal land were given a lighter sentence by a judge who then had his sentence reviewed by another judge. That judge imposed the 5 yr mandatory minimum required by the law passed by republicans in the Congress in the late 90's. They GOP did this because they said judges were too liberal and their sentences weren't just. To me, that only shows that politicians insist that everyone who doesn't believe the same way they do are somehow incompetent. I don't agree, but I did enjoy the irony of the basis of the recent dust up in Oregon.</comment>

<comment>All these sentencing guidelines came about because liberal judges did the liberal thing:  went easy on criminals, pervasively.  In the rising-crime era, people got sick of it, so they were on board with harsh sentencing baselines.I was part of the California recall of 1986, when Californians recalled three judges off the State Supreme Court (including the Chief Justice), because they were reflexively overturning death sentences (that is, they were subverting justice).  We ran those criminal-lovers out of town on a rail!People were just sick of crime and criminals getting off easy.  Start going easy again, and there will be blowback.</comment>

<comment>Sieg Heil!</comment>

<comment>Here come the Nazis.</comment>

<comment>I don't think so.  It had more to do with the fact that different judges could impose extremely different sentences on two defendants who had committed the same crime and had essentially the same background and aggravating and mitigating circumstances.  The Sentencing Guidelines tried to provide a framework that would produce more consistency and predictability in sentences among like defendants.Your recall of state court judges had nothing to do the federal sentencing reform.</comment>

<comment>Well that certainly is interesting.This bit:"For a century and a half, judges wielded this power with essentially unfettered discretion, but the system had drawbacks. Judges had no governing body, and they approached sentencing differently: Some saw incarceration as rehabilitative, while others saw it as retribution, or as a deterrent, or as a way to segregate dangerous people from society. And judges were not immune to the vicissitudes of public opinion. The potential for abuse of power was patent. Sentencing decisions were not even subject to a higher court’s review."Really captures it all. I wasn't aware that stare decisis didn't apply to sentencing (maybe that's wrong, but that's what it sounds like) and that there was no legislative guideline historically on what punishments judges should meet out. That's very different from how Canada's Criminal Code has operated for some time (I'm not sure about always, but for some time in any event). The Code gives judges an upper limit and a small number of mandatory sentences. Judicial decisions on sentencing are subject to stare decisis, (similar facts of crimes result in similar sentences, whereas worse instances of the same crime or repeat offenders or whathaveyou, get longer sentences). I.e. judges still judge here, and aren't free to do whatever they want (as sentences are subject to appeal) with respect to sentencing.With this background, I understand a bit better how U.S. sentencing guidelines came about. I didn't know this before.</comment>

<comment>Hey, glad I could help explain. Vis-a-vis stare decisis, that's not precisely what was at stake. (Sentences are not part of the "decision," and so are not part of the doctrine of stare decisis).  The debate here was about what constitutes "reviewable error" on the part of a sentencing judge. Until the Sentencing Reform Act, as I understand the history, an appeals court could not overturn a judge's sentence simply because it was too harsh or too lenient. There needed to be some other "error" for that decision to be reviewable. I hope that helps to clarify, rather than muddle!</comment>

<comment>Thanks for the reply and for the excellent article. The reply helps clarify things a bit further.</comment>

<comment>"The public wants an ideal arbiter: just, wise, and knowing. But while questing for that mythical, paternal figure who will make all the right decisions, it’s easy to become disillusioned with the inconsistency and fallibility of human beings."This is a great summary of our whole system. Thank you for this article. Well done.</comment>

<comment>oh</comment>

<comment>I'm not sure using a man convicted of trying to blow up a major airport and kill a massive number of innocent people is a great example to use when arguing for leniency in sentencing guidelines.  I have little compassion for this man as he was willing and took steps to mass murder.How about we look at mandatory sentences for non violent crimes?  Surely there's somebody in prison today that's been there for years and years for possession or trafficking. Or maybe that bank robber guy if he didn't use a gun or hurt anybody.</comment>

<comment>I was about to say the same thing regarding the child molester.  You are not going to find many likeable sympathetic people facing multi-decade federal prison sentences.  However, someone needs to be able to decide that 20 years is appropriate and 40 is excessive.</comment>

<comment>Hi Kevin. Yeah, that was exactly why I thought Ressam was such a good test of this idea of the limits of judicial discretion. It's easy for (almost) everyone to agree on giving leniency to someone whose crime (or attempted crime, in this case) is less horrific. The better test is a crime we can all agree is horrific and repugnant.</comment>

<comment>"overrun by drugs and drug violence" - More like the war on drugs.  These problems will mostly evaporate with decriminalization. The problem is that many people are dependent upon the crime-and-punishment industrial complex so they exaggerate and even abet the strife.  The irony is that many of the people who protest these injustices now come from the groups that originally promoted them: right-wing ranchers protesting mandatory minimums and inner city black leaders protesting the crack disparity.  Now they are going after 'human traffacking' and 'campus rape crisis epidemic' and whatever else they can think up.</comment>

<comment>"crime-and-punishment industrial complex" .......... LOL</comment>

<comment>The best way to avoid federal sentencing guidelines is to not be a scumbag criminal in the first place.</comment>

<comment>My, how disgustingly puritanical.</comment>

<comment>Is it time to reconsider three strikes?</comment>

<comment>Absolutely. I read an article recently that told the story of a man who had gotten busted a couple of times for, if I recall correctly, weed possession as a young man, but who had straightened out and was a pillar of the community, business owner, etc. Many years after his early arrests, his business partner made off with all the money from the company's bank accounts and he unknowingly wrote a couple of checks that bounced. I think you know the rest. He was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.Now that's admittedly an extreme case, but given that there are hundreds of thousands of people in prison for what we now see as minor drug offenses, it stands to reason that the potential for this kind of travesty is extremely high. I have no problem with some kind of sentence multiplier for people with several violent crimes, but in my opinion, a life sentence for a nonviolent offender is completely beyond the pale.</comment>

<comment>Sure.  We absolutely need to lock away the repeat criminals for a much longer time than the first timers. 3 strikes is a very crude way to do that.</comment>

<comment>The Supreme Court already is.  They have narrowed what is considered a "strike."</comment>

<comment>Initial sentencing reform is but one piece of the criminal justice system. In addition, early release program reform should be a part of the discussion. An indifferent, long sentence can be cured by multiple means. The length of time a convicted criminal spends in prison does not have to begin and end with a judge or jurist.</comment>

<comment>Thanks for reading. One fascinating aspect of the Sentencing Reform Act is that it eliminated parole for federal inmates. There is no early release program for federal prison; only a "good time credit," which earns you a little time off for good behavior. Parole is a BIG part of the conversation in state courts, but it hasn't been a part of the federal system since 1984.</comment>

<comment>Yes, this is a good point.  The federal system has no parole.  You will do almost all of a federal sentence. </comment>

<comment>To me, the biggest and most illuminating point of the article was the level of obscurity and impunity in which prosecutors operate. That topic really merits its own piece. Anything that has the level of privilege to operate so forcefully behind closed doors is something to be feared.I also applaud judge Coughenour for having the backbone to actually visit prisons and see for himself the conditions and stretch of time that their sentences render. I personally wouldn't mind if that were required of all judges and prosecutors, most of whom likely never have to confront their decisions in such a way.</comment>

<comment>I like this judge.Unlike me, he's unwilling to write off humanity in one swift stroke of extreme justice. Me, I'd kill them all (all humans lest you think you'd escape my wrath) and let whatever god or gods they preferred in life, sort them out. Gazing out across the corrupted landscape of the human world, I see no one that is righteous and deserving of life. Not even one.</comment>

<comment>Come to think of it I haven't seen any rainbows lately....</comment>

<comment>I think Nancy Gertner was referencing "Gray's Anatomy" (the textbook), not "Grey's Anatomy" (the TV show). I was understandably confused by the argument brought forward by this point - one letter drastically changes the meaning here.</comment>

<comment>Good catch, thanks!</comment>

<comment>Fixed. Really appreciate your sharp eye.</comment>

<comment>I think the author could have done a little more background on Booker and its effects on sentencing before writing an entire article about one district court judge's beef with the sentencing guidelines.  Perhaps look at the ten years of sentencing statistics post Booker to see how district court judges sentence and how appellate courts review those sentences, which I'm pretty sure the Sentencing Commission keeps.  Booker was a sea change.  I think the statistics would show that sentencing reform advocates need to focus their attention elsewhere now that the guidelines are merely advisory.  Mandatory minimums coupled with prosecutorial charging discretion has had a lot more to do with filling our federal prisons than the sentencing guidelines, which even now play a valuable role (albeit a much smaller one) in making sure judges' sentences don't become subject to mere whims and arbitrariness.</comment>

<comment>Hi, thanks for all your astute comments. Part of what got me initially interested in this topic is that the situation post-Booker is unsettled. As you point out, the mandatory minimums are far more influential now; the Guidelines are past. That's totally what I thought when I started reporting this piece.... But, according to the US Sentencing Commission (whose data I do not take completely at face value, but they're the best we have) most judges have NOT deviated significantly from the Guidelines post-Booker. And our federal prison population continues to grow faster than before, even if you control for people sentenced under mandatory minimums. There are all kinds of theories about why, but for some reason the Guidelines seem as prevalent as ever.</comment>

<comment>Discretion is a two-way street. For every Coughenor who wants to impose lighter sentences, there's going to be a hanging judge who wants to be harsher. It would be interesting to pin Van Meter down as to whether his real goal is discretion or just leniency.</comment>

<comment>Hi Tom. Thanks for the comment. When you said "his real goal," did you mean my goal or Coughenour's?If the former, I don't really have a goal. I don't pretend to be unbiased (I'm pretty defense-minded), but I was drawn to this issue because I'm fascinated by the questions raised by this issue, questions that are fundamental to how we administer justice: Who decides what an appropriate sentence is? What is the goal of a prison sentence? Whom do we trust to make those determinations?If the latter, I think Coughenour takes his role as sentencer very seriously. He agonizes over every decision, and he is not always on the side of "leniency." If his sentences sometimes seem lenient, I think he'd say that it's because the baseline sentences have become so absurdly long under the Guidelines.Hope that answers your question.</comment>

<comment>Prosecutors have unlimited discretion, stack charges, abuse the conspiracy rules of evidence and lean on the Guidelines to nail down plea agreements. Less than 10% of federal cases go to trial.  Make prosecutors charging decisions subject to review AND ditch the Guidelines. </comment>

<comment>Sadly, the alternative appears to be that the politically connected; the rich; and the physically attractive will receive lighter sentences than the norm and the poor and minorities harsher sentences.Judges, who are subjected to 24/7 flattery by lawyers, frequently lose sight of their fallibility and biases.</comment>
