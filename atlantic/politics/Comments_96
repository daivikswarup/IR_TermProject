<comment>Surprise isn't the word! Everyone should be disgusted at this useless bunch of do nothings! Where have they been years prior? They just show up a few days a year then need a vacation as their brains are so taxed by doing absolutely nothing all the while getting paid good money for it. Now when they have actually done what they should have been doing all along it's big news!! God willing things will change and this bunch of wasters will get thrown out of office and things will get done for the good of the country not just for an ideology of defeating Obama!!</comment>

<comment>They're the government and the things they do involve wasting your money and violating their rights. The TSA, Patriot Act, and TARP bailouts are examples of them doing something.  With action like that maybe you can see why I prefer gridlock.</comment>

<comment>Well, at least they got the capitol dome repaired--almost.  Better than nothing.  No SS payment increase for me this year though.</comment>

<comment>Well, I wouldn't want their jobs, raising money all the time, using god-talk constantly around constituents, and travelling all over to pick up checks from the fat cats and Neanderthal voter blocks.  I'll take retirement any day, or something useful like teaching.</comment>

<comment>Yes, but how many of those are actually good ideas?  I'd say the infrastructure one certainly is and trying to forestall Medicare insolvency through entitlement cuts would also be a good thing, but the rest seem like business as usual Washington and that is almost always bad.  Don't get me wrong, I'm also glad for whatever tax cuts we get, but I'd really like to see them be smarter about who and how they give those in an effort to fix the deficit and maximize the amount of benefit we get from them.</comment>

<comment>The article doesn't go into particulars about any of this stuff.  Too bad.  Article could be a bit longer.</comment>

<comment>Most of the tax cuts are just extenders being made permanent. Congress used to renew them every year and pretended that they were "temporary". Now at least they are  being honest. I would say that's good.</comment>

<comment>Passage of a $1.15 trillion spending bill, which loosens budget caps and lifts a 40-year-old ban on the export of U.S. oilWhat a train wreck. Ryan and McConnell need to go. Filthy Democrats.</comment>

<comment>the democrats wanted to keep the stupid ban on export</comment>

<comment>Are you accusing Ryan and McConnell of being "filthy Democrats," or just ranting about Democrats in general? inquiring minds want to know.</comment>

<comment>Ryan and McConnell? Democrats</comment>

<comment>Tee-hee!!</comment>

<comment>LOL. What about the 180 Republicans in the House who voted with Ryan on the Omnibus spending bill?  Only 95 voted against.</comment>

<comment>Horrible people</comment>

<comment>You do know that having bans on trade is a democrat thing, right ?</comment>

<comment>"Productive" for themselves perhaps but not for the American people.</comment>

<comment>Those were some moderately liberal legislations passed, though they would be truly liberal if they were paid for by taxes on upper incomes. The only conservative twist of those bills is they were all put on credit card and added to our debt.</comment>

<comment>You want all your expenses paid by someone else?</comment>

<comment>By those who benefit the most from having an educated workforce who are able to go from point A to point B without bridges collapsing.</comment>

<comment>Massively productive compared to Obama</comment>

<comment>Passing legislation  != productive</comment>

<comment>40-page law: productive200-page law: really super-productive1000-page law: totally awesomely productive!!</comment>

<comment>"...1000-page law: totally awesomely productive!!...".When the goal is tax breaks and subsidies for corporate clients - it is productive as hell - for the bank accounts of legislators.</comment>

<comment>Forgive me if I think passing legislation that leads to larger deficits is a curious way to define productivity.</comment>

<comment>It's easy to be productive when you're spending your grandchildren's money.(I have two grandchildren: one is two years old; the other six months. I'll likely be dead before they have to start paying my tab. Sorry, kids! Grandpa loves you--honest! Just keep believing that, and tell your grandkids what a great guy I was. And tell them to believe in the Easter Bunny, too. With luck you'll be dead before they catch on...)</comment>

<comment>You can always boycott SS, and refuse to receive any... That may help those grandkids a little...</comment>

<comment>Odd that congress passes legislature in the year prior to elections.  It's all political.  They saw the writing on the wall, and are trying to avoid it.  It's all in the name of self preservation.  Not so strange for congress, after all.</comment>

<comment>I'm a democrat-but that omnibus bill was a spending nightmare.</comment>

<comment>Not for the big corporations who benefit.</comment>

<comment>No more Harry Reid in charge.</comment>

<comment>Harry Reid was awful.</comment>

<comment>USCofC: "The imperative, as he (Sen Maj Ldr)  described to reporters early on, was to lay the groundwork for the 2016 election and to show voters that they needn’t be frightened of giving Republicans both the Congress and the White House" Sorry USCofC, today voters are very frightened that while they shellacked the Dems in '12 & 14 and gave the GOP their majorities, they has to listen to Schumer/Reid/Pelosi say hat Congress passed everything the Dems wanted - even  funds to harvest aborted baby tissues.The USCofC should be very worried that efforts are now under way to primary several of your GOP buddies.</comment>

<comment>Trade bills should be negotiated in the Congress and the Executive branch. We have not seen a reduction in spending or the size of government which is critical for our next generation's survival. We are broke. Deal with the spending now.</comment>

<comment>Can't figure out the recent spending bill; we went from some attempted purse string tightening (Republicans) to suddenly just writing an expensive bill.  All about keeping their jobs, I guess.....</comment>

<comment>What ever happen to the words like '' the power of the purse''</comment>

<comment>If that seems confusing to you, you simply need to add " Republicans" to the end of your paragraph ... The meaning simply is; they talk out of both sides of their mouths.   Whether you agree or not, the progressive message has been clear, consistent, and transparent... 1) expand healthcare, 2) increase revenue, ( taxes) 3) create a path to citizenship, (republicans have flip flopped every which way on that) 4) end the war on drugs, 5) overhaul our penal system...  I think it's been a busy seven years.</comment>

<comment>> progressive message has been clear, consistent, and transparent> end the war on drugs, 5) overhaul our penal systemHillary was running "Obama is soft on crime" the last time, and old Bill and a democrat controlled congress created the toughest "tough on crime" laws via a bill sponsored by Joe Biden.The "progressive" message has definitely not been consistent on crime and war on drugs, even if it is on domestic spending.Sources:http://www.vox.com/2015/4/30/8...http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08...</comment>

<comment>That was 25 yrs ago for Bill... Different time, different ideas for the Country . Hillary has her plan for the country, but... She's not running the show. She has no job in Washington right now, and people should listen closely to her message, and then decide if they want her leadership. That's no done deal yet.   When I say the message has been clear, I mean Prez. Obama's message since 2007. I'm amazed how much he has changed things, as are his advisarys.</comment>

<comment>> Different time, different ideas for the Countrya.k.a. inconsistency. Its not wrong to change your position, but it is then dishonest to claim that you are "consistent".> She's not running the showThere's like a 70% chance that she is going to be the next President. And maybe a 90% chance that she will be the Democratic nominee.I am not a leftie, but I can agree that President Obama is very statesman-like and a motivational leader. Though, not a very savvy politician in terms of legislative politics. A good example of how he has bungled the TPP, a policy that had huge Republican support:http://www.forbes.com/sites/da...https://medium.com/govtrack-in...He couldn't get his own party to play ball despite having actual progressive features to tout in the deal.</comment>

<comment>Nobody gets everything...  If those are Hillarys real odds, I like them... Doesn't really say much for her opponents...</comment>

<comment>Democrat and Republican corporate puppets should be happy about Congressional corporate gains:1.The Ominibus bill - money for refugees, illegal aliens, sanctuary cities, quadrupling of H2-B foreign worker visas, etc.Great for corporate profits and one-percenters - more bad news for average workers.2.Energy companies should like the ability to export oil - ( I thought energy independence was important for a strong America? I guess that no longer matters).3.Trade Promotion Authority - Again, great news for open-borders corporate types who are looking for bigger corporate profits at the expense of workers.4."...Tax-breaks for low income individuals...".  What does THAT mean?If you are truly low-income, you don't pay taxes anyway. What about the middle class?5. Whining that the GOP didn't solve "gun violence" or "overhaul immigration"?WTF?  Maybe progressives should allocate more money for prisons and vote for tougher sentencing- because most gun violence is done by career criminals who spend very little time behind bars.Here is a good example of a career criminal working a soft, progressive criminal justice system who just murdered a cop:http://www.nydailynews.com/new..."overhaul immigration" What is that supposed to mean? More amnesty? Progressives already got more money to help illegals- but they are unhappy with that?</comment>

<comment>4."...Tax-breaks for low income individuals...". What does THAT mean?===================Increased EIC?</comment>

<comment>Overhaul immigration is code for granting all the illegals amnesty.   Our government favors the non citizen the citizen.</comment>

<comment>Well I suppose the oil sold overseas will help the economy and the stock market, but it means our gas and heating prices will rise, also electricity.</comment>

<comment>Soak the rich.  Otherwise I don't want to hear about it.</comment>

<comment>Define rich and while you do that, don't forget to thank Obama lite Paul Ryan for making it happen.</comment>

<comment>Hasn't happened yet me bucko.</comment>

<comment>As I have maintained all along. Too bad it took a liberal hack to finally observe this fact. Thus no-one uses the terms ''do-nothing Congress'' any more. The liberals get their Omnibus, Obama his trade deal, trade unions, a transportation package and Americans, the biggest debt in the history of the human race which they will spend decades, if not centuries, paying down on.</comment>

<comment>So is this the end of blaming the economy on Bush finally after 7 years and its owned by Obama finally since he got 95% of what he wanted with the GOP help?</comment>

<comment>I magine the Prez. Is pleased,  but why in heavens name would we ever stop blaming the conservatives for the worst world-wide economic disaster since WW2...? Much better that they "own" that, for at least thirty yrs... </comment>

<comment>It was the ''end'' at any moment after March 15,2009, when Obama signed onto his first full spending portion of ARRA.The fact remains that Obamas administration has sent this nation deeper into the hole than all other presidencies combined.Why don't you liberals start ''owning'', this?</comment>

<comment>I'm sorry your deeper in the hole, I could say @ the end off Bush/Chaney era, I had no net gain for the entire 8 yrs... Now my net-worth is up 500%. For me, they will always own their 8yrs. I would hope it be well documented in the Bush library. I've never in my life feared the national debt, and if you would just read the article, most of whoever you voted for, don't seem concerned either.</comment>

<comment>It has never been this high ever in your life. As for myself, I can think of no sane reason whatever why this nation must pay between a half and one trillion dollars merely to service its own debt, as it will be doing after the debt reaches 20 trillions before the end of Obamas presidency, and with the rise in interest rates. I congratulate the conservatives of both Kentucky and Wisconsin, however, who will be running open-primaries on both Ryan and McConnell in order to force them from office as was the fate of Virginias Eric Cantor.</comment>

<comment>For 2006, the interest of the national debt was $405 million. 2007went higher, till 2008 climbed to $455 million... Those three #s added more than 1.6 trillion...  For the year 2016, the current administration will add $350 million of interest to the national debt. Why can't you learn to call a spade a spade?  If you've bought a car or home since 2006, your interest rates have lowered. Where you been?</comment>

<comment>Observing your dishonesty.Thats ''where''.You only use the singular year of ''2016''.You know damned well that that amount of interest on the debt reached a record during the collective period of years under this president. [ you are also in error on your figures which I have right here. Obamas 2011 was the highest ever recorded at 454 billion. There was no such year as your ''455'' under a Bush ]Here liberal.See for yourself.https://www.treasurydirect.gov...</comment>

<comment>On your sight; 2006=$405.8, 2007=$429.97, 2008= $451.1...  The 2016 is not on that sight, it's an estimate because it has not happened yet, the estimate is roughly $350, because rates are much lower than they were in 2008. I mention the year 2016 because you said; "between 1/2 trillion, and 1trillion... Your OFF by @ least 50%. I guess you can only know what you know... If you don't understand interest, that may make it harder for you to get out of debt...  Keep worshiping Bush, maybe you can ask Jeb to bring Dick back.</comment>

<comment>Then WTF did you mention ''2016'' liberal? You were the one granting it a set amount of ''350 million'' [ which is totally out of line anyhow ].You then come back and tell me that ''2016 has not happened yet'' and thus there is no way to place a dollar amount of debt interest on it at this time.You liberals are nothing, if not consistent, with your inconsistency....</comment>

<comment>Hee hee , no, don't forget your blood pressure... I'm not too good @ cut and paste.  I didn't make it up. I googled as you did, and a different gov't doc. Said 2016 will be... I also saw the doc that you posted, but roughed the #s a little...   This conversation,,( if we can call it that...) is about; are we paying more for interest on our debt? For right now, this year and next, we are not. Are we paying too much, probably... Are we paying more than before Obama? No...  We have work to do as a country, but Prez Obama will be retired in one more year, is's time to work on your next plan for our great country. </comment>

<comment>We thank you...</comment>

<comment>> Obama his trade dealWell, trade deals are a GOP thing more than a Dem thing, in fact that passed with mostly Republican votes, if I am remembering correctly.</comment>

<comment>And it was these issues that got done because the Dems can't figure out how to play race/ethnicity politics with them.</comment>

<comment>Ryan made productive use of the honeymoon afforded him by the conservatives....=======That honeymoon is OVER! The right is livid with new Speaker Paul Ryan’s trillion-dollar spending deal with Democrats and is ripe for a primary challenge. “Paul Ryan Betrays America,” blared a headline on the conservative site Breibart.com. And Twitter is littered with references to the Wisconsin Republican’s new “Muslim beard.”</comment>

<comment>Wasting money and creating new regulations is not being "productive".</comment>
