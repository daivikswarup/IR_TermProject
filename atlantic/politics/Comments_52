<comment>The truth of the matter is that more people in the U.S. defend themselves with a gun each year than are victimized by people with guns. Don’t take my word for it, ask the CDC.http://tinyurl.com/q83tdhyThe truth of the matter is that gun control is counterproductive. Don’t take my word for it, ask Harvard.http://tinyurl.com/9ku2mo6The truth of the matter is that there is more support for guns rights than gun control. Don’t take my word for it, ask Pew Research Center. Or CNN.http://tinyurl.com/qb3mtc7http://tinyurl.com/pshsg5zThe truth of the matter is that the crime rate, including “gun crimes” and gun homicides is at a 30 year low despite the sunset of the “assault weapon ban”, liberalized concealed carry, steady gun ownership, stand your ground laws, and ignoring the DEMANDS of the “gun control lobby”.Everyday our leadership has an opportunity to look at the root causes of crime and violence such as poverty and lack of opportunity and education, the War on Drugs, our revolving door justice system including plea deals, as well as mental health and the role of SSRI drugs and enact policies to address these issues.It’s time to move on from “gun control”.</comment>

<comment>You have to be joking.  You didn't read the article, did you?Blood on the gun industry's hands.  Blood on your hands.</comment>

<comment>Not it's not. See what I did there?</comment>

<comment>LOL! Bravo.</comment>

<comment>The ONLY person responsible for the Sandy Hook Shooting is Adam Lanza.</comment>

<comment>Exactly. People kill people. So let's keep the unstable people away from guns.</comment>

<comment>The problem with that is that the Government keeps redefining "unstable".  A Senior who was never great a math and asks for help with their checkbook is now part of the "unstable" listing.  A returning Vet who needs to work out the stresses of their overseas tour is now part of that "unstable" listing.  And NOW they won't to people on the completely arbitrary "No Fly" list on a "No Buy" list for firearms.  No proof, no conviction, no recourse once your name is on the list= no 2nd Amendment Right.We can all agree that mentally unstable people should not have access to firearms.  What we all don't agree on is who deserves the "mentally unstable" listing and who defines the term.</comment>

<comment>Have you read in the DSM 5  what constitutes a psychiatric disorder now?  Just  disgraceful.</comment>

<comment>The guy who shot up Kalamazoo was not known to have emotional problems. Its more important IMO, to reach out to those who begin to feel troubled rather than wait for a full-fledged diagnosis, when it may be too late. And reach out without malice, sanction, or ridicule.</comment>

<comment>Maybe so but I am sure there are plenty of gun owners who might want a little mental help or therapy but will now avoid it for fear of having their 2nd Amendment Rights stripped from them.</comment>

<comment>Agree 100%. The idea of being put on a list that affects bill of rights civil liberties is going to vastly reduce people seeking counseling for therapy for depression and other mild and common problems.</comment>

<comment>Agreed.</comment>

<comment>The idea of being put on a list that affects bill of rights civil liberties is going to vastly reduce people seeking counseling for therapy for depression and other mild and common problems.</comment>

<comment>Who decides stability? Your idol Stalin routinely said anyone who disagrees with him is crazy.</comment>

<comment>We already know from the VA that making lists of people with mental illness (and 50% of Americasn suffer some level of clinically detectable depression, anxiety etc) REDUCES the number of people seeking counseling.Some US jurisdictions controlled fully by Democrats already have a privacy waiver for mental health records .as part of their carry licence requirements.Seems pretty clear to me that the prospect of any mental health record putting you on a list of lower civil liberties will result in less people seeking care or counseling if they do have an episode of depression etc,</comment>

<comment>I agree. How  do you propose to do that without   making gun ownership more difficult for law-abiding gun owners?  How many guns in the country? How many gun owning adults?    Compare that to the real numbers of gun crimes, and the fact that  gun crimes are lower than they have been in  decades.  Can you admit that you seem to be willing to   deny  protected rights  for political reasons that have nothing to do with a political agenda?</comment>

<comment>Actually you are much better off keeping prior criminals away from kids. It should be illegal to have a prior criminal, who are 90% of all murder, domiciled in a home with kids.and eight out of ten of killings by the mentally unstable are with non gun means.so are you saying we should have public lists of anyone who has had counseling so we don't have live or work with then?</comment>

<comment>And how do you do that?</comment>

<comment>How do you suggest that be done?</comment>

<comment>I agree. They should be involuntarily committed instead of simply being medicated and released onto the streets to terrorize the law-abiding. Same with violent felons. The problem with the inner cities is not the availability of guns, but the availability of unincarcerated violent felons. </comment>

<comment>I read the article and it makes no sense. Military style? .223 is "high caliber"?The problem is Atlantic keeps having people write articles on firearms issues who have no knowledge of the subject.</comment>

<comment>Well said. </comment>

<comment>The Atlantic wants it both ways.In the hands of the military, the AR-platform rifles are underpowered, prone-to-jam pieces o' crap: http://www.theatlantic.com/mag...In the hands of civilians, they are (according to the article) "...essentially killing machines".To be fair to the author, his sloppy use of undefined, non-technical terms like "high-caliber" and "rapid-fire, and his failure to explain how the semi-automatic version of the AR rifle is suitable for military (!) use is contained in his paraphrase of the plaintiffs' complaint.Of course, then we're faced with having to decide who knows less about firearms: a reporter for The Atlantic or a Bridgeport personal-injury lawyer.</comment>

<comment>No!  The "killer" is to blame and the school also has a lot of blame in that they forced the teachers that could have protected themselves and the students from having the tools necessary.  So, sue the school board and put them in jail.</comment>

<comment>Blood on his hands for not agreeing with the article?  The foolishness is strong in this one.</comment>

<comment>and stupid is on you</comment>

<comment>Hey, good one!  Third grade much?</comment>

<comment>Moto you claimed the AR-15 is an a automatic military firearm. You demonstrate ignorance with every post.By the way support for an "assault rifle ban has never been lower, a clear minority. But do keep talking about banning them it sells more. The more guns the more crime falls</comment>

<comment>No, just matching your maturity level.</comment>

<comment>Do you really think so?  Really?</comment>

<comment>This article is a indirectly paid "partner" placement by the Trace, part of Michael Bloomberg's $400 million spending, almost all disguised as charity or  as "C4" non profit, but which is for practical purposes 100% political.The many compete falsifications in the article are part of why the NRA now has risen to  58% favorable rating in the latest gallup, why over 63% of Americans say owing a gun makes a home safer, why a majority of Americans now oppose assault and semi auto bans, why Gallup, pew, ABC, WSJ, CNN polls all show a clear 20 year decline in support for more gun control.This article and this suit are going ot increase gun sales -- especially of semi auto firearms, and increase gun ownership.But then again that is a good thing. US murder has long been declining as gun sales have increased -- criminals are scared of an armed populace</comment>

<comment>Tin foil hat much?</comment>

<comment>Being ignorant  and stooping to unfounded personal attacks reflects poorly on you intellectually and ethically.</comment>

<comment>Imagine my surprise when I found myself unable to reply to your "a good thing to focus on" comment to me, as the thread had been locked.My reply is still on topic here as it relates to visceral reactions to gun violence.After my situation had been de-escalated (obviously I did not get my brains blown out), I gently inquired of my host -- a family member -- what action should be taken.For context, this was deep rural, Aboriginal-heavy, Samsquantch territory. The kind of deep freeze survival environment where people are found frozen to death every year because they failed to correctly calculate their heat and Kj intake requirements.My host apologetically took the phone out of my hand (I'd been ready to call the RCMP...). "We don't call the police here. They will take away our guns [which upon further investigation is likely true] and we need them to survive. Are you alive? Are you okay? Do you think this crazy wouldn't have threatened you with whatever was handy?"This perfectly illustrates the point my dear friend Jed has often made about City vs. Country politics. </comment>

<comment>What a great story to relate! Civil Disobedience in the face of unrealistic laws is a good thing. It is too bad when it is made necessary. I still have this fantasy that the government should  work for us instead of treating us like their  servants.</comment>

<comment>what is tin foil? the advertorial piece is from a group created and funded by Michael Bloomberg</comment>

<comment>You wouldn't understand fourth grade.</comment>

<comment>Is reducing the argument to the level of a 3d grade playground  shouting match really what you want to do? It reflects poorly on you.</comment>

<comment>Another zinger!  You are on a roll, dude!  I'll bet you are the coolest kid in the third grade.</comment>

<comment>You must be one busy troll.  You already replied sarcastically to that comment.  Hours ago.  Good job.</comment>

<comment>The blood is on the hands of the criminals and other despicable human beings that resort to violence to achieve their malevolent intentions.</comment>

<comment>Scotsman, Antigunners insist I have no right to self-defense with the best tools available, but they will not take any responsibility for my personal  safety. What hypocrites! They just want to create   victims. Which is morally corrupt.</comment>

<comment>You just touched upon an argument I have been making since the original GFZ Act of 1990. One that I have argued exhaustively. I never understood the 'value' of becoming a martyr for a 'much grander social experiment'. Idiocy.</comment>

<comment>I stand right there with you, Scotsman.  Their insistence that I be  responsible for  all murders  is just emotional claptrap. I have established my responsibility to the US military.   But I took off the  uniform  after 30 years and am suddenly untrustworthy! What a compliment .</comment>

<comment>Collective guilt is an idiotic argument. Gun owners who have broken no laws  are as guilty as criminals???   That is a pretty vicious lie.</comment>

<comment>Not as guilty, just blood on your hands.  Learn to read.That Kalamazoo murderer did not use a spoon, did you notice?  HOW MUCH MORE MURDER WILL YOU SUPPORT?</comment>

<comment>No blood on my hands. What a nonsensical emotional argument. I would see all the scum executed or life in prison with no parole. Heck, I got medals for the killing I did.</comment>

<comment>This is me laughing at you.  I support murder? You want to take away the best self-defense tools there are and   create victims. You think you are in any way morally or intellectually superior.  You are not.</comment>

<comment>Kalazmoo murder ar t he fault of gun control advocates. Not one law they propose would have had any affect.</comment>

<comment>Look, just because YOU'RE a bigot, doesn't mean everyone has tin foil wrapped around their heads thinking that the gun industry is evil.</comment>

<comment>Funny you should mention tin foil..</comment>

<comment>Why?  Because I was right?</comment>

<comment>This is "paid partner placement" by a group clearly part of the gun contrl lobby.</comment>

<comment>Idioto! I am in no way responsible for the criminal acts of another, as much as you would like to punish everyone who owns those guns you hate. The concept of  collective guilt is  not in any American law.  Just wishful thinking on your part.</comment>

<comment>So, facts do not matter to you? Because everything Dan Daniels states is exactly correct.</comment>

<comment>You sound like a compete conspiracy theorist</comment>

<comment>This is me, laughing at you.  You do not even see the hypocrisy in that statement?  You think  that  a total ban would disarm criminals? Nonsense.  As demonstrated in Russia, Venezuela, Mexico?  You think that disarming the law-abiding citizenry would protect them.  Your stand is immoral.?</comment>

<comment>Repetitive as you are stupid.</comment>

<comment>TOS. and that is no kind of argument. In any class on logic or debate you would fail.</comment>

<comment>This is me, laughing at you. Your nonsense is purely emotional, with nothing moral  to justify disarming  law-abiding citizens. You would rather punish  all gunowners instead of   criminal animals? Do I understand correctly?  No blood on my hands. I take no responsibility  for the actions of Bad People. And just because you say so does not make it a fact.</comment>

<comment>Actually, it is you spouting nonsense.More gun violence yesterday.  More blood.  ON YOUR HANDS.</comment>

<comment>That is no kind of argument.  Blood on my hands? I was nowhere near  there. Your ignorance in trying to apply collective guilt will win you no court cases.</comment>

<comment>Hilariously false.</comment>

<comment>"NO UR RONG"Why even bother commenting?</comment>

<comment>No it's not. See what I did there?</comment>

<comment>How is it false? Overall trends on support for more gun control keep falling. In fact the younger you are the more you are likely to oppose bans on "assault rifles" and semi auto hand guns:http://www.pewresearch.org/fil...huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/20/...</comment>

<comment>Dr. Schultz, we eagerly await your masterful disproof (with citations in mainstream news sources and peer-reviewed journals, of course) each of Mr. Daniels' arguments.</comment>

<comment>Do you normally have a problem with distinguishing fantasy from reality?Everything Daniels stated is exactly correct.</comment>

<comment>It would make much more sense to sue video game manufacturers and Hollywood.</comment>

<comment>And Stephen King, whose book glorifying a school shooter was found among the personal effects of the first large shooter the rest are copying</comment>

<comment>......fucking seriously?</comment>

<comment>As seriously as suing any manufacturer of a legal product.Why do the un-American trash of Obama's half of America think one is OK but not the other?</comment>

<comment>Why is that not serious? Stephen King's novel Rage where he glorifies school shooting was the inspiration for several school shootings. Bushmaster doesn't glorify shooting anyone or depict any shooting of children</comment>

<comment>How about suing auto manufacturers or breweries because idiots get drunk and drive, or Al Gore for all of the lies he has told about Climate Change or whatever it's called this week? Where do you stop?</comment>

<comment>why don't you just get informed and  google  -- Stephen king rage school shooting --  and see that the early school shooters were all influenced by Stephen king making a hero out of a school shooter.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>How so?</comment>

<comment>You make excellent arguments, but I would also like to add that in order to achieve the level of gun control necessary to appease a few 'busy bodies' in positions of power, we would require a national security apparatus that would be unparalleled in its grotesqueness and scope; something resembling a orwellian police state.Even more offensively, these new provisions would no doubt be used disproportionately against minorities and the lower economic classes of our society, just like asset forfeiture and the drug war have led to similar abuses.As a socially liberal person, this is absolutely unacceptable to me.</comment>

<comment>What a stupid question. A manufacturer is not responsible for the subsequent actions of a customer.You may as well hold Budweiser liable for those who drink drive, or Hillerich & Bradsby Company for those who kill with their baseball bats.*Heck, plenty of car companies depict reckless/entertaining driving in their ads, should we sue car companies for bad drivers? Of course not.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>What risible logic you just queefed 💨A retailer is not responsible for the subsequent actions of its customers. Your abrogation of personal responsibility is pathetic. I may buy a gun and shoot you, and diminish my responsibility by arguing it wasn't my fault, your honour; the advertising campaign compelled me to do it.Bushmaster does not advertise military weapons. They're semi-automatic, the same as any hunting rifle: 1 trigger pull, 1 shot. The same as a revolver, even! 🔫Bushmaster does not advertise committing mass-murder of children, either.</comment>

<comment>Oh, but they are military weapons! Because cosmetics!/sarc</comment>

<comment>yes, that's part of the sales appeal.</comment>

<comment>could you possible be more ignorant? The sales appeal, and why a majority of Americans  who dont even own one are opposed to banning them, and why cops are opposed to banning them, is they are simply very well working guns</comment>

<comment>WRONG. The "sales appeal" is their ease of maintenance, extensive array of configurations available, etc.  In more than half the Country, the AR 15 style platform is LEGAL for use in hunting, for anything from "varmint" small game, all the way up to much larger game, again, depending on configuration. Not that the 2A has or ever did have ANYTHING to do with "hunting".  And anyone suggesting the AR15 is " high power" is simply lying or a moron. It is actually far UNDERPOWERED. There are literally nearly 30 other common calibers on the market for "traditional guns" that are MUCH more powerful and will penetrate a cops vest or a steel door like a hot knife through butter.    Has there suddenly been a rash of people dying or killing others with high performance cars because of the "sales appeal" of their marketing material, which OFTEN highlights reckless driving, street racing or actual "on track" performance?</comment>

<comment>In fact it is.</comment>

<comment>yes, plenty of those from gunnuts, as usual. :-)</comment>

<comment>Where, in the Constitution, are our Rights limited to "needs"?Semper fi</comment>

<comment>you seem to be the only one here with a murder fantasy?And over 90% of people who support more gun control think Us gun murder rose when the US murder rate fell nearly 2/3 since the 1990's. YOU are the delusional flat earth paranoid -- and you are the one watching too many movies</comment>

<comment>It is the Bill of Rights, not the Bill of Needs. You are the delusional one who cannot find it in himself to grow up and face reality. The shop keepers during the LA riots were sure glad they had ARs and standard capacity magazines. The people in New Orleans were sure glad they had ARs. I was sure glad I had an AR when a group of thugs tried to mug me. I know feral pig hunters who were sure glad they had an AR. You are an immature loon who refuses to grow up and take responsibility for your own safety. Then you have the gall and the nerve to come on websites and make feeble attempts to insult those of us who are responsible.</comment>

<comment>I believe it's called the Bill of Rights, not the bill of needs or necessities.</comment>

<comment>You comment is simply a strawman wrapped in a red herring.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>I don't see a metaphor, mixed or not. You did use both strawman and red herring arguments</comment>

<comment>"violent use" - absolutely.  If someone is attempting to kill me or other innocents around me, I am all for "violent use" of tools against the threat.  Exactly why millions of violent crimes are stopped/prevented every year by an armed good guy.</comment>

<comment>By your reasoning, any fair reading of the literature demonstrates that cars and motorcycles are meant to appeal to exceeding the speed limit.  Therefore, anyone killed through excess of speed would have recourse to the court system to sue manufacturers of automobiles and motorcycles.  The same would apply to any hyperbolic advertising, and subsequent misuse of a product that results in injury or death, right?  And yet, the Left never advocates for such, saving your vitriol for the Constitutional Right to keep and bear arms.  Why is that?Semper fi</comment>

<comment>there is no marketing of this product that depicts killing, never mind killing of children. here are plenty of video games that do -- and glorify it -- as well as novels such as Stephen King's rage.</comment>

<comment>No, that is not why they look the way they do. I mean really you knwo so little about this topic it is laughable.</comment>

<comment>john... then perhaps you can explain why out of the tens of thousands of this particular gun sold you can find perhaps a half dozen where they are used in a mass shooting? Give detail. Provide specifics.</comment>

<comment>Please provide a citation for your assertion that Bushmaster markets to a group of people more likely than the general population to commit crimes.On the other hand, here is a Harvard study showing alcohol companies market to college students, almost all of whom are underage, and directly contribute to binge drinking:http://archive.sph.harvard.edu...I found the alcohol marketing study in literally 5 seconds via Google. Please refer me to the equivalent study for gun marketing.</comment>

<comment>False</comment>

<comment>so you are for suing video game makers? Stephen king for glorifying school violence?</comment>

<comment>Where do you show that at all?</comment>

<comment>Yes, and every good citizen should support training and owning of such tools.  When a violent criminal attacks, self defense many times requires "deadly force" and I for one want the "good guys" to have the very best tools necessary.  Just as the framers of the Constitution wanted the "good guys" to have the same level of weapons as the government.</comment>

<comment>"every good citizen should support training and owning of such tools."You betchum. The federal government certainly does:http://thecmp.org/about/</comment>

<comment>"The marketing language certainly implies its use in violence directed toward other human beings."And of course, all violence directed at other human beings is either a. in war, or b. by criminals.</comment>

<comment>Of course it implies such use, just as auto and motorcycle ads imply exceeding the speed limit.  Does that make them legally responsible for such behavior?Implication is not direction.

<comment>No it just goes to prove that you just parrot the idiotic, childish insults of the anti-gun lobby. Try to come up with something original. By your logic, every auto manufacturer who portrays his product being driven speedily gives the subliminal message that you should operate their product recklessly. Therefore every traffic fatality is the manufacturer's, not the driver's fault. Of course, you only want to use this practice against guns, you hypocrite.</comment>

<comment>This comment was deleted.</comment>

<comment>That is a ridiculous and utterly irrational argument.The vast majority of murder of children, near 90%,  is by prior criminals living in homes, several orders of magnitude more than any assault rifle. assault rifles are not 0.01% of murder of childrenIt is time to start suing people who allow criminals to be domiciled in homes</comment>

<comment>This article is very misleading</comment>

<comment>apples and oranges, but everyone (except murderers) wants to reduce the exposure of potential victims to persons with violent backgrounds.</comment>

<comment>it is not apples to oranges, it is the real risk factor.</comment>

<comment>two relatively independent factors, not a single factor</comment>

<comment>Wow. No. one is not a risk factory, while prior criminals are.</comment>

<comment>And we have laws for that already. The suit is without merit.</comment>

<comment>Data shows democrat judges and Democrat jurisdictions on average sentence violent criminals to lower terms</comment>

<comment>actually support for sentencing  length shows Democts do not want to reduce  exposure.</comment>

<comment>So why then aren't you advocating keeping violent felons and crazies off the streets? Damn near every criminal use of a firearm is tied to a shooter with documented mental illness or a felony conviction record.</comment>

<comment>I'm the simpleton when you can't even come up with s logical argument? I've seen Bushmaster's ads and if they cause you to have violent thoughts them you're the one with the problem.  I seriously doubt Adam Lanza read them and I really think e didn't need some subliminal message to go off. I've owned and shot firearms since I was eight and never even contemplated shooting anyone, at least in civilian life.  I suggest you go back to the Bloomberg websites and find a more original argument if you can. Oh, and try to be an adult and drop the insults.</comment>

<comment>There it is again, "guns like these", or "such a weapon". What exactly do you think you're talking about? Do you have any knowledge of the history of military arms? Pretty much every US Military firearm from the 1795 Springfield on down has also become a firearm for the American public. What makes the AR-15/M-16/M-4 so much worse than any other previous military arm that eventually became a sporting/defensive arm for the public?</comment>

<comment>(somebody above commented that the AR-15 is not mil.)</comment>

<comment>Understand of this topic is apparently beyond your ability.</comment>

<comment>your attempted insult has no relevance to the comment to which you replied.</comment>

<comment>Hey, pot, meet kettle.</comment>

<comment>When you demonstrated you have no knowledge? No one is insulting you but you.</comment>

<comment>And it isn't. The current military does not use a semi auto sporting rifle.It is, however, similar to the M-16 in that it looks like one and the M-16 does have semi-auto capability and shoots the same round. Thus he stated "AR-15/M-16/M-4" to cover the entire family of arms.</comment>

<comment>Wow you really have all the talking points down don't you.  "Military style" weapons, "warrior" thing, fatigues; etc.  you left out gun safety but I see you got sanity in there. I haven't worn fatigues since I got out of the Army and coming from a police family I know criminals are real. So do us all a favor and just lock yourself in the basement and let the rest of us go about our lives the way we wish. </comment>

<comment>There is no such thing as a "Military style weapon".  ALL rifle categories began as military designs.  The military uses select-fire arms.  What you fear are firearms' appearance.  BTW, ISIS has attacked us.  Al Qaeda has attacked us.  There is no paranoia when you are truly under attack.  Precisely what "bs" have you been reading about ISIS and criminals, that is demonstrably untrue??Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Only a fetish to you collectivists that refuse to grow up.</comment>

<comment>Well, since I don't even have a penis, you can't insult the size of mine.   I'll speak to your comment: "You can keep burying your head in the sand and deny all you want, but these shootings will keep happening as long as this goes on."  As a mother and grandmother I KNOW these shootings WILL continue to happen as long as the anti-guns/anti-2nd amendment people such as yourself decide those same children CANNOT be defended by the admin/security carrying guns to do so.    These liberal 'gun free zones' are also responsible for these children NOT being PROTECTED because of those who take the position they should be left unprotected....decent, law abiding people should NOT be allowed their US Const RIGHTS to defend themselves and those in their charge.

Those "certain types of consumers", portrayed as isolated radicals - are owners of the most common, popular rifle at the current time. None of the marketing encourages MURDER! This is nothing more than a political attack on an industry and on a right of citizens to a POWER, that a political party is desperate to destroy - of which you are a part - either with malice - or of being naive about history and in understanding firearms and ballistics capabilities and how they relate to the "BALANCE OF POWER" that is ultimately what the second amendment is!</comment>

<comment>Here are one or two."...the high-caliber, rapid-fire rifles are essentially killing machines."  These rifles are small caliber rifles, and they fire no faster than a Remington Model 8, introduced around 1918.  And, the Remington Model 8 is truly a "high caliber" rifle.Here's another."...because it uses military imagery to entice the wrong sorts of consumers—civilians—to buy the product and then harm others with it."  Civilians are the only consumer of this product, the rifles not being military select-fire rifles.

Should Budweiser pay the victims of drunk drivers? Should match companies have to pay the victims of arson? Should rope companies have to pay the victims of kidnapping? Of course not. The same logic applies in this case.</comment>

<comment>Do you understand the difference between a rope and an automatic, military assault weapon?Do you take stupid pills?</comment>

<comment>The AR-15 used by Lanza was not automatic nor a military model. Please get your facts correct before calling people "stupid."And the beer example is exactly analogous. It is a legal product, enjoyed by many lawfully, and misused by some to hurt people. Just like guns.</comment>

<comment>Do you? The AR-15 is not an automatic rifle.</comment>

<comment>Actually,  they're designed to mimic automatic fire with a type of spring driven recoil that will pull the trigger after a round is fired unless the user moves it out of the way. Technically not automatic but functionally so.</comment>

<comment>ATF says not automatic.So isn't.Period.Or do you want to say those with fast trigger fingers makes any weapon automatic?</comment>

<comment>I really don't care. I'm only interested as a spectator.  Many of my friends own ar-15s but I don't I don't like them. They're neither hunting rifles, nor target guns. They're really not great for home defense, as it's foreseeable that a round could pass through a wall and land in a child's room.</comment>

<comment>22 rimfire will also penetrate most walls.even birdshot from a .410 will penetrate drywall.No wall is bullet proof to even weak cartridges.You can't defend yourself with Nerf.</comment>

<comment>Well, that's the point, isn't it. You should discuss and find the ideal home defense weapon.  IMO that's a .38/.357 revolver with a 41/2 inch barrel, and a trigger guard.</comment>

<comment>... as opposed to what? A 4-inch .38 Spl. without a trigger guard?</comment>

<comment>lol</comment>

<comment>No, as opposed to a snub nosed gun, or a smaller caliber automatic.</comment>

<comment>wow. learn about firearms before making a bigger fool of yourself</comment>

<comment>Conceivability is a factor. My .357 snubby fits beautifully in my pocket. The 4-in.? Not so much.</comment>

<comment>Too much kick, and not that reliable at 50 feet.</comment>

<comment>I think you mean, "not that accurate at 50 feet"?But both issues are easily addressed with training and practice.</comment>

<comment>Yes. You're right. I prefer the pocket .45s though.</comment>

<comment>You're worried about over penetration and you want a .357 mag?HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</comment>

<comment>.357 has much lower muzzle velocity than a .223 rifle. For home defense you want stopping power, loudness, and limited penetration.</comment>

<comment>Really?The .357 magnum also has more mass. And you do not want loudness since you probably won't have hearing protection.  Furthermore, the .357 is not louder than a .223 rifle.http://www.theboxotruth.com/th..."At the request of Peekay, I shot a .357 Magnum 158 grain JHP out of my 6″ Colt Python.Much to our surprise, it was stopped by the 10th board after going through 9 boards. It was fully expanded."Penetrated 9 boards....that's 4 walls.The 5.56 penetrated 12 boards.... 6 walls.  http://www.theboxotruth.com/th...So...BOTH over penetrate.  You might want to learn something about guns before you shoot your neighbor by accident.There is no such thing as "stopping power" unless you are talking shotgun. At household ranges, 9mm, .38, and .357 will be effectively the same thing.   If you must use a pistol, at least a .45 leaves big holes while moving slowly.</comment>

<comment>You want loudness bc as soon as that trigger is pulled good neighbors dial 911. The ringing in one's ears goes away after a few  hours.</comment>

<comment>The neighbors dialing 911?  Unless you are in an apartment or firing outside, or having a gun battle, most neighbors won't hear you.   Personally, I'll take a suppressed firearm over "loudness" any day.  Helps with shooting accurately if you are not used to the noise.  The target won't care about "loudness" because, hopefully, you will have stopped him.</comment>

<comment>Everyone has a preference. I prefer handguns for home defense, and I like stopping power and longer barrels.  There are many models that fit the bill.  The .38 is an excellent choice. It's reliable, has more stopping power than a 9mm, and is low maintenance. Also, while a military man may opt for "lead in the air" a normal person does just fine with five or six well-aimed rounds.</comment>

<comment>Sure.  Except that one never has too much ammo. And if you want big bullets and less velocity: .45 ACP.And modern ammo has leveled the "stopping power" playing field.Similar wound channels.http://www.ar15.com/ammo/proje...</comment>

<comment>You couldn't be more wrong, .38spl doesn't have more stopping power than 9mm. Now I love revolvers, and I actually have a 4" .38/.357. I also happen to have a a 9mm pistol, and you need to read up on the ballistic statistics of each cartridge.  9mm develops twice the chamber pressure of .38spl, and delivers 50% more energy at the muzzle than .38 at all comparable bullet weights. .38spl is a fine round, but it doesn't come anywhere near 9mm in the energy department.</comment>

<comment>I couldn't be more wrong? What if I had said you could hunt elephants with a bow and arrow?</comment>

<comment>We're talking about actual measurable differences between two different cartridges, you are wrong.</comment>

<comment>What is it that I'm wrong about? The stopping power of a handgun or the inutility of an AR-15 in a civilian setting?</comment>

<comment>"The .38 is an excellent choice. It's reliable, has more stopping power than a 9mm"Did you even read my reply, and then figure out what I was referring to? </comment>

<comment>You miss the point entirely. It was little to do with the old argument of 9mm vs. .38 and everything to do why the AR-15 is inutile for home defense.</comment>

<comment>No, you are changing the argument that YOU made specifically referring to .38 vs 9mm. I quoted your text that I was responding too. Not only are you wrong about .38 vs 9mm, you're wrong about the AR too.</comment>

<comment>Chris, do you really believe that anyone can be wrong all of the time?  What we're dealing with here is the establishment of reasonable limits. Where you and I differ isn't on the effectiveness of a proven weapon, military or otherwise but on what constitutes intelligent behavior handling firearms.</comment>

<comment>You apparently are trying to prove that one can indeed be wrong all of the time. J/K.What do you think constitutes intelligent behavior handling firearms?</comment>

<comment>Intelligent behavior means studying the available products and their intended use, as well as limiting a personal collection, and exhibiting caution when faced with a person intentionally assembling what might be classified as an arsenal.</comment>

<comment>Classified by whom exactly? Whats an arsenal? and why is it even important how many firearms a person has? Have you ever heard of a mass shooter using dozens of different firearms during his attack?</comment>

<comment>Yes we would like to reach an objective standard of reasonable behavior. We agree that a home owner has a right to a firearm for defense and we agree that possession of two dozen machine guns and a hundred claymore mines is unreasonable. The question is where to draw the lines between those extremes.</comment>

<comment>Wheres the line for you?</comment>

<comment>For me it's a shotgun, a rifle, and two or three handguns. Some for target shooting, some for hunting, and some for safety such as self and home defense.</comment>

<comment>So, ONE shotgun, ONE rifle, and 2-3 handguns? That's what you consider a reasonable "stable" of firearms? I don't want a shotgun, can I have an additional rifle?</comment>

<comment>Of course I did. I believe that the Constitution is the law of the land and as a citizen of the United States I am obliged to agree with it.</comment>

<comment>In what way does the AR have no utility in a civilian setting?  You got the "stopping power" argument wrong, so if that is your argument, you lost already.  Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Who said no utility? Not I. I said that a military style rapid weapon is inutile, ie., unreasonable and when advertisers attempt to sell these weapons they highlight the inutile features, such as rapid fire mechanisms and military styling.</comment>

<comment>Merriam-Webster defines "inutile" as useless, unreasonable.  The AR-15 is neither.  And again, styling is meaningless, as ANY rifle can be made to look like a scary black rifle.  Additionally, there is no "rapid fire mechanism" that doesn't also exist on 100 year old semi-automatic rifles.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Styling is very important to the argument that advertising can glorify weapons designed for a battlefield. To compare obsolete longguns with modern assault weapons seems to me to be intellectually dishonest.</comment>

<comment>See, your argument falls flat again!  The military does not use semi-automatic rifles in the assault.  Therefore, the AR-15 is NOT an assault rifle.  Furthermore, the Model 8 is not obsolete, nor are any of the military arms in use throughout the 20th century.  Semper fi</comment>

<comment>As I said to another chatter here, it is extremely unlikely that everything your opponent says is flat out wrong, and anyone who tries to demonstrate the 100% wrongness of another likely is just plain obstinate.</comment>

<comment>No, not everything a political opponent says is always incorrect.  But continued error, after being corrected, points more to zealotry than opinion.  You use a term that has no military meaning, there being no such thing as an "assault weapon".  To term the AR-15 an "assault rifle" would also be incorrect, given the rifle's semi-automatic design.  The M-16 may be called an assault rifle, properly.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Genuine gun lovers desire more educated advertising not less.  Can you honestly state that all manufacturers and all advertisers are reasonable responsible people?</comment>

<comment>Genuine gun lovers, like genuine auto lovers, genuine beer lovers, etc., enjoy advertising for what it is, advertising.  If it is something new, we then go to research and friends for knowledge and opinion.  Stop trying to paint a broader picture.  Firearms manufacturers are heavily controlled by government.  Advertising falls under the heading of free speech.  Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Your defense of industries as a whole is disturbing to me, as I'm quite certain that within any industry there are irresponsible elements.</comment>

<comment>Bullets for the .38 Special run in the exact same weight range as the .357.  Semper fi</comment>

<comment>Dude, are you just making stuff up for the attention?</comment>

<comment>A fast light bullet loses energy faster than a slow heavy bullet.  A 223 carbine is superior to .357 for home defense assuming ammo is chosen appropriately.  It will have less chance of overpenetration (again ammo type important) and better stopping power than 357.</comment>

<comment>Additionally, a handgun fits comfortably in a night table while  a long gun must be propped up somewhere to have use in home defense, where it likely be difficult to decorate around and more attractive to non-defensive situations. However, shotguns have a long tradition as a home defensive weapons. I for one would be uncomfortable knowing that a close neighbor intended to defend himself with a high-penetration weapon.</comment>

<comment>As stated before, an AR-15 is no more high penetration than 0.357 if ammo is selected correctly.  I have a quick access safe that holds my mine.  Blends in fine.I'm not saying that 0.357 is a bad choice.   You are saying that an AR-15 is a bad choice.  In that, you are simply wrong.  I've trained with some great instructors and law enforcement officers and many recommend and use a carbine for home defense.   I shoot a ton of handgun, shotgun, and rifle competitively (thousands of rounds per year) and from that experience I know that under stress, a rifle is more effective.</comment>

<comment>Man uses AR-15 to fight off armed home invader</comment>

<comment>Barry made some excellent points, but I would like to add that the problem with handguns is that because there are only two points of contact (two hands), versus four points with a long gun, they require more training to operate proficiently, which is very important if one wants to avoid inadvertently sending a round where it isn't supposed to go.Many credible instructors have proven that a proper, fully extended handgun shooting pose doesn't *save* any more space within close confines than a carbine like the AR15. In order to be more 'compact' with a handgun, it would require pulling it in closer which is bad for proper sight alignment/picture, thus, less conducive for accurate fire.If high penetration is a concern, there is a wide variety of ammunition types available for 5.56/223 caliber that are specifically designed to address overpenetration concerns, making them no more of a overpenetration risk than a specifically designed handgun cartridge (and less so than even 00 buck in a shotgun in some cases). The best example I can think of off the top of my head is Hornady's 55 grain TAP.</comment>

<comment>Yes, certainly instruction is important. In the state I reside one mandatory instruction is required before issuance of a concealed carry permit. Of course more than one is ideal. When we get to the choices of ammunition, obviously that's a level above hitting the target and not pointing a weapon at anyone. The problem, as I see it, is that defenders of the gun manufacturers when forced to retreat will blame ammunition manufacturers, who sometimes make high-penetration shell.</comment>

<comment>Because .357 mag can't punch through drywall. Really? Also, I've never seen a modern handgun without a trigger guard, kindly enlighten me.</comment>

<comment>You're talking about the round piece of metal, I'm talking about a trigger lock. I suspect you knew that but were in an argumentative mood.</comment>

<comment>Actually no, a trigger guard is an actual thing, and is not an interchangeable term with trigger lock.</comment>

<comment>And ARs are both hunting and target capable.They work fine on varmints, and for punching holes in paper accurately hundreds of yards downrange</comment>

<comment>Of course you can, but they're not optimal for either and not marketed as either.</comment>

<comment>False</comment>

<comment>Untrue. An AR-15 is an excellent firearm for home defense.</comment>

<comment>Especially in rural areas where law enforcement assistance may be 20 minutes or more away.</comment>

<comment>In all areas of the country law enforcement arrives in time to prevent under 3% of crime. Gun owners prevent about 22% according to the low CDC published estimate. They don't stop all but they do stop way more than relying on police alone.It is why, if you are not a prior criminal (and 90% of gun violence  criminal on criminal), owning a gun makes the household about 20% safer than homes with no guns. Someone else already posted this result showing more Americans  know this than ever:http://www.pewresearch.org/fil...</comment>

<comment>In the suburb where police response times are very quick, I am content with my revolver and a couple of reloads. On the land outstate I also want a longer reach and 20 round magazines available.</comment>

<comment>Dave, I fully support whatever you think is appropriate. In suburbs or anywhere though you are also quite likely to face more than one attacker. In which case capaciy matters. That is why suburban cops average 15-17 rounds in their mags.</comment>

<comment>Sure, and everybody has their own situation. Mine is pretty simple in town, as I have a small house, a motion alarm to alert me, and just one bedroom door to defend until the police arrive. Outstate is totally different, with more house, land, buildings, and often there are guests.</comment>

<comment>urban areas often are worst, including poor police response times</comment>

<comment>The US National Rifle Match is fired predominantly with the AR-15, out to 1,000 yards.  Varminters are fond of the rifle for prairie dogs, though not only that rifle.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>"[AR-15s aren't] target guns"The federal government disagrees: http://thecmp.org/competitions...Besides, all guns are target guns, brah."it's foreseeable that a round could pass through a wall"Which is equally true of common defensive handgun rounds. Your argument is invalid.</comment>

<comment>Wrong, the AR platform is an outstanding firearm, and does everything you claim it doesnt. Hunting, target shooting, defense. It's the most adaptable civilian firearm in history. You can literally take the stripped receivers and add whatever components you want to make whatever you need, SBR/PDW..sure! MOA accuracy at 1-200 yards...without breaking a sweat even on cheap rifles! MOA at 750-1000 yards...yes with a lot of money spent! Hunting....sure, what do you want to hunt, there are literally dozens of calibers available for the AR15, if they don't have enough punch, step up to the AR308/AR10 platform, same functionality, larger cartridges. Stop being a FUDD, civilian firearms don't need a wood stock to make them acceptable.</comment>

<comment>There's no argument that it's not. The argument is that it isn't the best hunting rifle, and in fact isn't really useful for any sort of big-game or trophy hunting, as a target weapon it's nowhere near competitive or sniper weapons, and for home defense it's too dangerous.</comment>

<comment>Keep moving those goalposts.</comment>

<comment>There is no "best hunting rifle".  The .22, perfect for squirrels, is lousy on Cape Buffalo.  The .458 H&H, perfect on the Cape Buffalo, is lousy on squirrels.  That is a specious argument.  At Camp Perry, it forms the largest percentage of rifles on the line at the National Matches.Semper fi</comment>

<comment>That any rifle should be "lousy on Cape Buffalo" seems disingenuous from a commenter who describes hunting elephants with bow and arrow as normative behavior.</comment>

<comment>Then you know absolutely zero about the Cape Buffalo!Semper fi</comment>

<comment>The Department of Defense considers AR15s to be suitable for personal defense in close quarters:http://radioviceonline.com/dep...</comment>

<comment>You don't know what you are talking about when it comes to the AR-15.  I use it as a target competition rifle almost every single weekend.  The National Match AR-15 is only made for target shooting.  I use the AR-15 platform to go hunting every year.  I have done so for at least a decade.  The AR-15 is a spectacular close quarters combat rifle, and absolutely ideal for home defense.It pains me to see the posts of people that are completely ignorant when it comes to firearms, speaking as if they have any inkling of what they are talking about.  Making statements that are flat out false and sticking to them like they are pillars of truth.  Complete nonsense.If you want one of the best firearms, with the best bullets designed for the least over penetration, then go buy yourself an AR-15 in .300 Blackout, loaded with Lehigh Defense 300 AAC Blackout / Whisper 194gr Subsonic Maximum Expansion Ammo.  Once they hit their target, they dump all their energy and stop penetrating.</comment>

<comment>I'm glad that you're an educated and responsible shooter. Are you saying that you represent the dumbest most irrational irresponsible shooter, or one of the opposite?</comment>

<comment>The grand majority of gun owners are law abiding, safe and responsible people.  That is why there are over 300 million firearms in the U.S. and the grand majority of the 8,124 firearm homicides (2014) are handgun, inner city circumstances.  More than 50% of those murders were Black on Black street crime.  The U.S. doesn't have a gun homicide epidemic, the dirty little secret is that the inner city Black population has a gun/homicide problem and nobody is addressing that directly because the first thing that comes out of a progressive's mouth when you do is, "Racist!"  If you subtract the homicides of the Black population which is roughly 56%.  The homicide number is approximately 3,375 in a country that has a population of 322,762,018.  That would give the U.S. a firearm homicide rate of 1.05 per 100,000.  You don't injure the rights of the grand majority, to curb the behavior of those that don't follow laws anyway.  Last I heard, murder is against the law, so passing laws against gun rights won't stop the killers.</comment>

<comment>I'm glad you agree there's a problem even if I find your description of it as reprehensible.</comment>

<comment>The truth burns some people's sensitivities sometimes... and again the problem... is a progressive one.  They need to clean their own cage, and then we'll talk about the rest of America.</comment>

<comment>"Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored." Aldous HuxleyBeing "offended" does not alter the truth.</comment>

<comment>I have never understood people that are more repulsed by all the secondary adjectives (race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, ethnicity and nationality), than they are of the truth of what is really happening.  They are generally extremely biased people too.  If you mention that a terrorist attack was done by a White Christian Republican, they would be cheering in the streets.  If you state a fact, "The vast majority of religious hate and terrorist attacks are done by Muslims and to be precise Islamic jihadists that are following the literal meaning of the Koran."... you're an Islamophobe and they are repulsed by your hate speech.  It's mental.</comment>

<comment>Hey, it isn't old fat white NRA members gunning each other down in the streets, or doing drive-by shootings, etc... What did you find reprehensible in his comment? I saw no racial epitaph's, just facts.</comment>

<comment>Well, I don't believe I can advance our discussion commentating further on what I read there. Sorry.</comment>

<comment>So sad you don't care to address the where/how/why of the overwhelming majority of gun homicides. Are you familiar with the phrase, "put the big rocks in first"? Do you enjoy being ineffectual?</comment>

<comment>Once again I'm disappointed with a post that contains a direct insult. I found that particular discussion philistine in its attribution of societal problem as a racial issue.</comment>

<comment>I'm sure you'l get over it. Anyway, we should move on, this is obviously a touchy subject for you. Wouldn't want to offend anymore. Let's get back to fighting over that fraction of a percent of gun homicide.</comment>

<comment>I would discuss that gladly but never in racial terms.</comment>

<comment>So you won't discuss it then. It's not just a societal problem, it's a cultural problem, and that culture has become part of their race.</comment>

<comment>Although I might go so far to agree that there exist in America today a separate Black culture, I would respect it to the degree that it is not the root of gun violence in America.</comment>

<comment>I'm curious. Why do you find a factual recital to be reprehensible? Everything he stated is in the FBI Uniform Crime Reports.The Black community has a crime problem which is ignored by the liberal elite, unless it is using it to call a political opponent, "racist."</comment>

<comment>Yes, I would agree that there exists several communities largely populated by blacks, And I would agree that many of them suffer from disproportionate violence. I would never ever agree that they are the cause of that violence, and the history of the slavery and Jim Crow is offered as evidence that they often are victims. Not only victims of white individuals but communities largely populated by whites.</comment>

<comment>I am not, nor is anyone else, stating that they are the cause due to their race.They are stating that the fact is, that black males, between the ages of 16 and 40, commit the majority of murder in the US.  Thus, about 6% of the population contains 50% of the murderers. Whites commit 49% of the murders.  There is a greater concentration among the black population.Their race is not the cause. This is demonstrable due to the fact that rural whites and blacks have similar murder rates. So, something else causes these men to engage in murder.</comment>

<comment>I'm not exactly sure where we are now. Are you saying that neither race nor guns is the cause of high crime neighborhoods Blacks inhabit?</comment>

<comment>Exactly.Because there are neighborhoods that contain both and have low crime. Many high gun ownership areas have low crime. Many black neighborhoods have low crime. If the two neighborhoods intersect, there is not necessarily high crime.Most of the high crime areas in strict gun control areas, with the except of New Orleans and Baton Rouge and Memphis.The War on Drugs and the drug trade are instrumental in most of the shootings. Thugs of all races use arms to establish dominance and "solve problems." See Chicago and DC. See Baltimore, New Orleans, Detroit, Memphis, etc.</comment>

<comment>That's fine. As long we limited the discussion of cause to exclude both of those "factor" I'm happy to continue.</comment>

<comment>"Actually, they're designed to mimic automatic fire with a type of spring driven recoil that will pull the trigger" yada yada YADA.Given the "knowledge" of firearms technology actually displayed above, I strongly suspect that you actually couldn't  identify which end of the tube the round actually comes out.</comment>

<comment>I think that you're a detective.</comment>

<comment>More like a detector.A bovine scat detector.</comment>

<comment>100% FALSE. it is no way functionally automatic. </comment>

<comment>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!oh...you're serious.HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!</comment>

<comment>Don't laugh, Bloomberg came to him in a dream and said it was so.</comment>

<comment>That is completely false.</comment>

<comment>You're talking about bump firing, and it's a possibility with most firearms due to the recoil impulse pushing the firearm rearward. No firearm is specifically designed to operate in this manner. When held and operated as designed, bump fire is not a possibility. Technically, and fuctionally, the AR15 is a semi-automatic rifle.</comment>

<comment>The entire point of the lawsuit in question is why is the civilian version of the M-16 marketed to the general public? Many of us have used the weapon and few of us would choose it for civilian purposes.  There's really no sense to it except for gun nuts.</comment>
